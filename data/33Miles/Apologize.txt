It's been going on for so long 
 All the words we said wrong way back then 
 And I still hear them all in my head 
 It keeps playing over and over again 
 I can't run, I can't hide, it don't matter how hard I try 
 To move on, but... 
 I don't want to leave it, bury it and forget it 
 I've already wasted so much time 
 Can't wait another moment, am I all out of chances 
 For you to believe it's on my mind 
 I've gotta let go of my pride and apologize 
 I thought I would never let go 
 Never thought I could know what it's like 
 To wake up, holding what I gave up 
 After all this time still trying to find 
 What it is to forgive even when it isn't that easy 
 So please believe me, 'cause... 
 If I caused you pain, I will take the blame 
 You can put it on me 
 If I broke your heart, if I left a scar 
 Let me say I'm sorry 
 I've gotta let go of my pride 
 And apologize

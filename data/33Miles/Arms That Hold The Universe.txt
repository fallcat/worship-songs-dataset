I know it seems like this could be the darkest day you've known 
 But believe you me, the God of strength will never let you go 
 He will overcome, I know 
 And the arms that hold the universe are holding you tonight 
 You can rest inside, it's gonna be alright 
 And the voice that calmed the raging sea is calling you His child 
 So be still and know He's in control 
 He will never let you go 
 Through many dangers, toils, and snares you have already come 
 His grace has brought you safe this far, and His grace will lead you home 
 And the arms that hold the universe are holding you tonight 
 You can rest inside, it's gonna be alright 
 And the voice that calmed the raging sea is calling you His child 
 So be still and know He's in control 
 He will never let you go 
 You can hope, you can rise, you can stand 
 He's still got the whole world in His hands 
 You can hope, you can rise, you can stand 
 He's still got the whole world, the whole world in His hands 
 And the arms that hold the universe are holding you tonight 
 You can rest inside, it's gonna be alright 
 And the voice that calmed the raging sea is calling you His child 
 So be still and know He's in control 
 He will never let you go 
 He's still got the whole world in His hands 
 In his hands, yeah 
 He's still got the whole world in His hands

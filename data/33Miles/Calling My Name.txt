On a Sunday morning in the back row 
 Never thought I'd end up there 
 'Cause I was running from You down a dead end road 
 I was just too scared 
 To ever let you in so deep 
 To think that You could rescue me 
 But You were always out there calling my name 
 Through it all, You always loved me the same 
 I was running so fast when you grabbed my hand 
 Saying, "I won't let you fall away" 
 You were always out there calling my name 
 I never knew Your love could be strong enough 
 To make me turn that page 
 From a sinner so lost to a sinner 
 That's swimming in a sea of grace 
 'Cause You were there all along 
 Always chasing after me 
 I don't know why it took so long 
 For me to finally see 
 But You were always out there calling my name 
 Through it all, You always loved me the same 
 I was running so fast when you grabbed my hand 
 Saying, "I won't let you fall away" 
 You were always out there calling my name 
 And When the road gets rough 
 It's Your voice I hear inside me 
 Saying don't give up 
 You'll never leave me 
 You'll never leave me 
 You are always right here calling my name 
 And through it all, you always love me the same 
 And when I'm running so fast, Jesus pull me back 
 Don't ever let me fall away 
 Let me always hear you calling my name 
 Let me always hear you calling my name 
 Let me always hear you calling my name

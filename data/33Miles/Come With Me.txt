Where's that greener grass you've been looking for 
 You can't see it anywhere anymore 
 You've been knockin' down fences just to find it 
 Seems no matter how hard you try 
 You can't fill the void you have inside 
 With anything the world says it enough 
 You know that it will never be enough 
 Come with me 
 And I will show you Jesus 
 And he will give you more than you could ask or imagine 
 Come with me 
 If you're lookin' for a Savior 
 If you lookin' for a friend 
 I know someone you should meet 
 So come with me 
 Come with me 
 Tired of everyday being just another day 
 You can't take it anymore anyway 
 You've done everything in your power 
 To change it 
 Seems no matter how much you do 
 Well all your plans keep falling through 
 You need wings to get you off the ground 
 For every time the world has let you down 
 Come with me 
 And I will show you Jesus 
 And he will give you more than you could ask or imagine 
 Come with me 
 If you're lookin' for a Savior 
 If you lookin' for a friend 
 I know someone you should meet 
 I'm not claiming to hold all the answers 
 But I'm holdin' on to the One who does 
 Come with me and I will show you Jesus 
 Come with me 
 Come with me 
 And I will show you Jesus 
 And he will give you more than you could ask or imagine 
 Come with me 
 If you're lookin' for a Savior 
 If you lookin' for a friend 
 I know someone you should meet 
 So come with me 
 Come with me 
 Come with me and I will show you Jesus

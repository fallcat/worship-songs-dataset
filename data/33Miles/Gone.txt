I lost my head, lost my mind 
 Living in the middle of a prodigal life 
 Oh, that's where you found me 
 About neck deep in a heap of sand 
 You asked, do I want a new life to live 
 And you, oh, you said love could save me 
 And there in a moment, things changed 
 For the first time, I found grace 
 And the old me began to fade away, until it was... 
 Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
 Now I've got Jesus and that's a fact 
 I'm on track and never looking back 
 I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
 Gonna let the past be history 
 Not gonna let it get the best of me 
 I'm out the door 
 What are you looking for? 
 I'm gone 
 You don't have to tell me twice 
 All I ever wanted was to make it right 
 Oh, you gave me forgiveness 
 And every little shadow in my life 
 Started fading away into the light 
 Almost can't believe it 
 'Cause there in moment, things changed 
 For the first time, I found grace 
 And the old me just like all my old days, there were... 
 Now I can see the sun is shining 
 I'm looking at a brand new start 
 I'm a million miles away from the world 
 And I can't believe where you've taken, taken my heart 
 Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

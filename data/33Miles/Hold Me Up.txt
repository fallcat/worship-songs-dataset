I had all the pieces put together 
 I thought it was all under control 
 But now I am face to face with failure 
 I'm fighting these fears I've never known 
 I'm falling to my knees 
 Would You hold me, would You hold me up 
 'Cause I can barely, I can barely stand 
 The weight I carry is gonna pull me under 
 God I need You, yeah, I need You now 
 'Cause all around me my world's crashing down 
 And You're the only, You're the only One 
 That can hold me up 
 Take me away from all the chaos 
 Give me the strength to live again 
 There is a Truth found in the promise 
 That You are the Hope that never ends 
 I'm crying out Lord, please, 
 Would You hold me, would You hold me up 
 'Cause I can barely, I can barely stand 
 The weight I carry is gonna pull me under 
 God I need You, yeah, I need You now 
 'Cause all around me my world's crashing down 
 And You're the only, You're the only One 
 That can hold me up 
 I'm desperate for Your peace 
 I'm crying out Lord, please 
 Would You hold me, would You hold me up 
 'Cause I can barely, I can barely stand 
 The weight I carry is gonna pull me under 
 God I need You, yeah, I need You now 
 'Cause all around me my world's crashing down 
 And You're the only, You're the only One 
 That can hold me up

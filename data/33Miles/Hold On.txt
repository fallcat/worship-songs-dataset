I've been there a thousand times 
 Felt the rain like a thousand knives and it hurts 
 I know it hurts 
 I've been there like a fighter plane 
 Trying to fly my way through a hurricane and it's hard 
 I know it's hard 
 Don't be afraid 
 You'll make it through 
 Just call out to me 
 And I'll come running to you 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 When the current pulls you under 
 And your heart beats like thunder 
 Just give me your hand 
 And hold on 
 Hold on 
 Until the storm is over 
 And I'll be fighting for you 
 Just give me your hand 
 And hold on 
 I'll give you hope I'll give you faith 
 And if it's dark I'll light the way for you 
 For you 
 By your side until the end 
 Until you're standing tall again 
 I'm here 
 I'll always be here 
 Always be here 
 And if the tide sweeps you out to sea 
 When your strength is gone and it's hard to believe 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 When the current pulls you under 
 And your heart beats like thunder 
 Just give me your hand 
 And hold on 
 Hold on 
 Until the storm is over 
 And I'll be fighting for you 
 Just give me your hand 
 And hold on 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 When the current pulls you under 
 And your heart beats like thunder 
 Just give me your hand 
 And hold on 
 Hold on 
 Until the storm is over 
 And I'll be fighting for you 
 Just give me your hand 
 And hold on

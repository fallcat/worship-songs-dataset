I see 
 Your fingerprints 
 You're breathe of life 
 Is the evidence 
 And I see 
 Your beauty 
 Your majesty 
 Surrounding me 
 And I can't deny 
 Your way too evident 
 I can't ignore your 
 Presence in this place 
 Your grace is overwhelming 
 And I cannot hide all this love inside, 
 I can't deny, I can't deny 
 I feel 
 Your mercy 
 Your faithfulness 
 Over flowing 
 And I know 
 Your peace that passes 
 All of my 
 Understanding ooh 
 And I can't deny 
 Your way too evident 
 I can't ignore your 
 Presence in this place 
 Your grace is overwhelming 
 And I cannot hide all this love inside, 
 I can't deny-- 
 Your everywhere that I could ever be 
 I can't deny- 
 Your even in the depths of my soul 
 And I can't deny 
 Your way too evident 
 I can't ignore your 
 Presence in this place 
 Your grace is overwhelming 
 And I cannot hide all this love inside, 
 I can't deny--

Pain touches everyone 
 Heartache falls on every heart 
 And all of us go through the storm 
 It doesn't matter who you are 
 And you're up against the wind 
 And you feel you've just lost your way 
 Listen to me say... 
 I loved you then, I love you now 
 I will love you tomorrow 
 When this world breaks you down 
 I will give you strength to stand 
 Look to me, take my hand and just believe 
 Before this day ever began, I loved you then 
 Time changes everything 
 Moments fly by like the wind 
 You can try to hold on so tight 
 But you'll never get time back again 
 You feel stuck with your mistakes 
 Can't turn anything around 
 And it seems there's no way out 
 I loved you then, I love you now 
 I will love you tomorrow 
 When this world breaks you down 
 I will give you strength to stand 
 Look to me, take my hand and just believe 
 Before this day ever began, I loved you then 
 I won't let you go, not even for a minute 
 So don't lose hope 
 Pain touches everyone 
 Heartache falls on every heart 
 I loved you then, I love you now 
 I will love you tomorrow 
 When this world breaks you down 
 I will give you strength to stand 
 Look to me, take my hand and just believe 
 Before this day ever began, Before this day ever began, 
 I loved you then, I loved you then

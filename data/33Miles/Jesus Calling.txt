What do you see when you look at your world today? 
 Is it so full of clutter that you feel like you're going insane? 
 And you can't fight back 'cause you're just too afraid 
 And it seems like the clouds in your sky don't wanna change 
 You see there's always another story, another side to every coin 
 And how you see your circumstance is all about a choice 
 When you see the rushing wind, feel the pouring rain 
 Hear the thunder now as the clouds roll in 
 You're blinded by the lightning 
 Do you also hear that still, small voice saying 
 "It's okay you're not alone 
 You may be scared to death but I won't let you go" 
 You may think the sky above is falling 
 But can you hear Jesus calling? 
 What do you see when you look at your world today? 
 Do you see a glimmer of hope, or has it all turned to gray? 
 Well start by counting your blessings one by one 
 Oh and I'm sure right there, you'll start to see the sun 
 You see there's always another story, another side to every coin 
 And how you see your circumstance is all about a choice 
 Because the darker the night, the brighter He can shine

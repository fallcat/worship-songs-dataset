Woke up to the pouring rain 
 Stumbled out of bed with half a brain 
 Twenty minutes late for work again 
 But it's alright, it's alright 
 No time for coffee, gotta hit the door 
 Grab a shirt from off the floor 
 Never noticed it was stained before 
 But it's alright, it's alright 
 Oh, but nothing's gonna bring me down 
 No, not now 
 It's just one of those days 
 When everything's right 
 God is in his heaven and I'm walking in the light 
 So hallelujah anyway 
 It's just one of those days 
 You look at the sky 
 Throw your hands up and you laugh at life 
 So hallelujah, Lord be praised 
 It's just one of those days 
 The boss calls... yeah, I know I'm late 
 I had a flat on the interstate 
 Tell the man that he can wait 
 Don't get uptight, it's alright 
 Hold on... there's another call for me 
 No, I didn't buy a diamond ring 
 Somebody stole my identity 
 Hey it's alright, it's alright 
 Oh, but nothing's gonna lay me low 
 'Cause I know... 
 So come on rain, lightning strike 
 Just you try to shake my life 
 You got no power, you got no hold 
 'Cause it is well with my soul 
 So hallelujah, Lord be praised 
 It's just one of those days

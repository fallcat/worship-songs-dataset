You say you don't have much 
 That's OK 'cause it don't take much at all 
 You can start right where you are 
 It don't matter how small 
 Oh and you're scared your voice 
 Won't ever be heard above the crowd 
 Well my friend here's your chance 
 To live out loud 'cause... 
 A little bit of love goes a long, long way 
 A little bit of hope can change the day 
 You could be the miracle that someone's waiting for 
 All it takes is just one flame 
 And you can light up the darkest place 
 Well you'd be amazed 
 A little bit of goes a long, long way 
 With your two hands 
 You can turn this whole wide world around 
 And with just one dream 
 You can flip it upside down 
 'Cause the smallest faith 
 From a heart that believes 
 Can overcome the impossible 
 You can make history 
 Don't waste another minute 
 Don't let another chance go by 
 'Cause today might be your day 
 To change somebody's life 
 A little bit of love goes a long, long way 
 A little bit of hope can change the day 
 You could be the miracle that someone's waiting for 
 All it takes is just one flame 
 And you can light up the darkest place 
 Well you'd be amazed 
 A little bit of goes a long, long way

Who told you you were all alone 
 Who told you this is all there is 
 What's holding you so you can't take hold of hope 
 You're stuck so deep that you can't move 
 Don't you want to 
 Live, live 
 'Cause you were made for so much more than this 
 Live, knowing that God loves you 
 He's been with you all along 
 He wants you to know the truth so you can live 
 You're worth enough that He died for you 
 His heart burns with love and desire for you 
 Don't be afraid to receive 
 Don't be afraid to believe 
 That you can 
 Live, live 
 'Cause you were made for so much more than this 
 Live, knowing that God loves you 
 He's been with you all along 
 He wants you to know the truth so you can live 
 He knows what your pain feels like 
 Rest through His arms all night 
 So don't you give up now 
 Let Him show you how to live, live 
 Oh, yeah 
 Don't you want to 
 Live, live 
 'Cause you were made for so much more than this 
 Live, knowing that God loves you 
 He's been with you all along 
 He wants you to know the truth so you can live

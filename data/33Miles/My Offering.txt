I betrayed, You forgave 
 I ran away, still You stayed 
 And I lived a lie, You spoke the truth 
 Now I'm undone, with no excuse 
 I cursed Your name, You called me child 
 I was to blame, You went to trial 
 And I lived to take, You died to give me more than I could ever find 
 And on my own, I made a mess of things 
 But You take it as my offering 
 You take the best and worst of me 
 And peace is at Your throne 
 Where the broken are made whole 
 And I can't imagine anything 
 More beautiful or amazing 
 When I bring everything 
 And You take it as my offering 
 I'm full of doubt, You're full of mercy 
 I come unwound, but You restore me 
 When I'm shaking like a leaf, You're the comfort that I need 
 That melts my fears away 
 And on my own, I made a mess of things 
 And You take it as my offering 
 My life is made an offering 
 I'm Yours and Yours alone 
 You take it as my offering 
 My life is made an offering 
 I'm Yours and Yours alone

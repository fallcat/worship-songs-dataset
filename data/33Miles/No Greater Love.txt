On a hill 
 There was a cross 
 And all was lost 
 In need of a Savior 
 There You were 
 Arms stretched wide 
 Crucified 
 No love could be greater 
 Than when you laid down your life 
 Who am I that You would come and die 
 I don't understand 
 Why the God of all the universe 
 Would become a man 
 To redeem the mess that I have made 
 And take away the shame of what I've done 
 There is no no greater love 
 Every sin 
 That held me down 
 Is lifted now 
 Because of your mercy 
 Here I stand 
 Forgiven and free 
 Grace covers me 
 Though I'm so unworthy 
 But You laid down your life 
 Who am I that You would come and die 
 I don't understand 
 Why the God of all the universe 
 Would become a man 
 To redeem the mess that I have made 
 And take away the shame of what I've done 
 There is no no greater love 
 What love that you would give 
 Your life that I might live 
 Who am I that You would come and die 
 I don't understand 
 Why the God of all the universe 
 Would become a man 
 To redeem the mess that I have made 
 And take away the shame of what I've done 
 There is no no greater love

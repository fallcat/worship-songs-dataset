He never thought he cared so much about the minute hand, 
 Until he started playing for a second chance, 
 If he could only do it all again, 
 He'd trade the long nights that he spent behind his desk, 
 For all he missed, 
 He tells his wife, 
 I wish that this moment in this room, was not me dying, 
 But just spending a little time with you 
 You only get just one time around, 
 You only get one shot at this, 
 One chance, 
 To find out, 
 The one thing that you don't wanna miss, 
 One day when it's all said and done 
 I hope you see that it was enough, 
 This one ride, 
 One try, 
 One life, 
 To love. 
 She never thought she cared so much about those little hands, 
 That held on tight the day she left, 
 Till she was scared to death, 
 Sitting all alone on a hotel bed, 
 The end of the road, 
 The sun has set on her big plans, 
 To feel young again, 
 She picks up the phone, 
 Dials the number, 
 Hears that little voice, 
 That's haunted every single mile, 
 Since she made that choice, 
 You only get just one time around, 
 You only get one shot at this, 
 One chance, 
 To find out, 
 The one thing that you don't wanna miss, 
 One day when it's all said and done 
 I hope you see that it was enough, 
 This one ride, 
 One try, 
 One life, 
 To love. 
 You only get just one time around, 
 You only get one shot at this, 
 One chance, 
 To find out the one thing 
 That you don't wanna miss, 
 One day when it's all said and done 
 I hope you see that it was enough, 
 This one ride, 
 One try, 
 One life, 
 One ride, 
 One try, 
 One life, 
 To love, 
 To love,

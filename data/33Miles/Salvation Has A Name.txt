I come to the altar and I bow before you 
 You are everything my heart desires 
 A friend that is closer than any brother could be 
 I'm so amazed I can call out to you 
 And you hear me 
 Salvation has a Name 
 Mercy has a face 
 Holiness was crucified, rose to give us grace 
 Salvation has a Name 
 Mercy has a face 
 Jesus, our holiness 
 Worthy of all praise 
 Every moment that I come to know you 
 I find a new dept of love surrounding me 
 Deeper than oceans higher than any mountain peak 
 I'm so amazed at the wonder you hold 
 I can hardly believe 
 Jesus, Father, the Maker of time 
 Healer Teacher the maker of light 
 You are sustainer to every life 
 God our Saviour 
 Salvation has a Name 
 Mercy has a face 
 Holiness was crucified 
 And He rose 
 Jesus, our holiness 
 Worthy of all praise 
 Jesus, our holiness 
 Worthy of all praise 
 Salvation has a Name 
 Salvation has a Name 
 Salvation has a Name

Saw you the other day 
 When you passed my way 
 I had to do a double take 
 Something in your smile 
 There was something in your eyes 
 And I could tell there'd been a change 
 And it is such a miracle, what God has brought you through 
 And everything about you is just shouting out the proof 
 There's something different about you 
 There's something different about you 
 I see God's love in your heart 
 And He's making you shine 
 There's something different about you 
 There's something different about you 
 You got God's love in your heart 
 And He's making you shine 
 There's something different about you 
 I just can't help myself 
 I get so overwhelmed 
 Every time I look around 
 To see your love outrageous 
 So contagious, where you were 
 And where you faith is taking you now 
 Higher than you've ever dreamed you could ever be before 
 And I knew it the moment that you walked right through the door 
 So go and tell the good things that Jesus has done 
 Let every moment be your moment to tell everyone, yeah 
 Something different, something different 
 Something different, different about you 
 Something different, something different 
 Something different, yeah

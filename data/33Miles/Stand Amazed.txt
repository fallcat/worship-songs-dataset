I don't really know how long forever is 
 But that's how long 
 I'm gonna give my life 
 Everything I face that tries to tear me down 
 No, I won't back away 
 From the sacrifice 
 I won't forget what your love means to me 
 You are always there to light my way 
 When all the lights go down 
 The world is quiet no one else around 
 I wanna be the same man 
 That will serve you then 
 Like I serve you now 
 Let my convictions never change 
 Oh let my need for you remain 
 As real as the moment I was saved 
 I will always stand amazed 
 Sometimes my heart desires such selfish things 
 When the moment comes 
 Help me to trust 
 There's something better that you have for me 
 If I can just hold on 
 You are enough 
 I won't forget what your love means to me 
 You are always there to light my way 
 When all the lights go down 
 The world is quiet no one else around 
 I wanna be the same man 
 That will serve you then 
 Like I serve you now 
 Let my convictions never change 
 Oh let my need for you remain 
 As real as the moment I was saved 
 I will always stand amazed 
 You will be my strength when I am weak 
 When I want to give in and not turn the other cheek 
 Let this be the prayer that I speak 
 When all the lights go down 
 The world is quiet no one else around 
 I wanna be the same man 
 That will serve you then 
 Like I serve you now 
 Let my convictions never change 
 Oh let my need for you remain 
 As real as the moment I was saved 
 I will always stand amazed

What if in the morning when I wake up 
 Even before I fill my coffee cup 
 I said Thank You 
 Thank You 
 What if I looked at the day and the hours ahead 
 And before I moved forward I bowed my head 
 And said Thank You 
 Oh I said thank You 
 What if I looked at my life in a different way 
 Took a little more time to stop and pray 
 I know it would change all the moments in between 
 So here I go 
 Thank You for everything 
 Thank You for loving me 
 It don't even matter what tomorrow brings 
 I will sing my Thank You 
 For sun and rain 
 For what You give and take away 
 For all Your goodness 
 I will always say 
 Thank You 
 I say Thank You 
 What if I lost everything that I had 
 I could smile and somehow still be glad 
 And say Thank You 
 Thank You 
 Cause life is joy, life is pain 
 But the prayer of my heart will never change 
 I say Thank You 
 Oh I say Thank You 
 What if I looked at my life in a different way 
 Took a little more time to stop and pray 
 I know it would change all the moments in between 
 So here I go 
 Thank You for everything 
 Thank You for loving me 
 It don't even matter what tomorrow brings 
 I will sing my Thank You 
 For sun and rain 
 For what You give and take away 
 For all Your goodness 
 I will always say 
 Thank You 
 I say Thank You 
 Thank You for everything 
 Thank You for loving me 
 It don't even matter what tomorrow brings 
 I will sing my Thank You 
 For sun and rain 
 For what You give and take away 
 For all Your goodness 
 I will always say 
 Thank You 
 I say Thank You

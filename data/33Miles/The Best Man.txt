I have always dreamed 
 To be that superhero 
 To fly right in and somehow save the day 
 And I have always wanted 
 To be more than I could be 
 But seen to fall and somehow lose my way 
 But the day your love stepped in 
 Was the day my life began 
 Cause you will make me shine 
 You will make me soar 
 You will make me everything I never was and so much more 
 You give my strength 
 You let me stand 
 I don't have to move a mountain 
 But I know I can 
 Cause you make me the best man 
 Event through my weakness 
 You know who I am 
 And you give me amazing grace that I don't understand 
 There are no words 
 That could ever describe 
 The glory of, the beauty of, You in my life 
 Because You gave Your love to me 
 I'm the best that I can be 
 Cause you will make me shine 
 You will make me soar 
 You will make me everything I never was and so much more 
 You give my strength 
 You let me stand 
 I don't have to move a mountain 
 But I know I can 
 Cause you make me the best man 
 I will never the same 
 Cause you have changed everything 
 From the man I was to the man that's standing by Your side 
 Cause you will make me shine 
 You will make me soar 
 You will make me everything I never was and so much more 
 You give my strength 
 You let me stand 
 I don't have to move a mountain 
 But I know I can 
 Cause you make me the best man 
 The best man

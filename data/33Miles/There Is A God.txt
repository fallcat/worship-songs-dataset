There's a beauty to the dawn, a rhythm to the rain 
 A silence in the soul that I just can't explain 
 There's a breath of life I breathe, a beating in my heart 
 A magnificence, a scary sense of what lies past the stars 
 Beyond what we can see behind the mystery 
 I know that it could only be 
 There is a God; this is the proof 
 That all around the evidence is speaking the truth 
 From the center of my soul to the edge of the universe 
 Creation is crying out believe it or not 
 There is a God 
 There's a dept that has been paid, a grace that I've been shown 
 A hope that I've been given that I have never known 
 There's a love that conquers darkness a piece of life in me 
 There's a life that's not just here and now but for eternity 
 Beyond what we can see behind the mystery 
 I know that it could only be that 
 I believe it; I believe it 
 There is a God 
 I can feel it; I can feel it 
 There is a God 
 And the more I find the less I need to see 
 I've never been so sure, so sure of anything

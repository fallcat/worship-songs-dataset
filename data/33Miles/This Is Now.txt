You were all alone 
 You were constantly broken 
 You felt so unloved 
 You were left abandoned 
 What a difference love can make 
 To the deep heartbreak back then 
 This is now 
 This is hope 
 This is the end of a longing 
 The beginning of a road 
 To a change 
 Where everything around you no longer falling down 
 This is now 
 This is now 
 You're allowed to dream 
 You can think of tomorrow 
 And you can say goodbye 
 To all of your sorrow 
 Thant's the difference love can make 
 To the hurt you've held within 
 This is Jesus 
 What you've been waiting for 
 So open up 
 Hear the words 
 Your life is lost no more 
 This is now 
 This is hope 
 Beginning of a road 
 Where every chain around you no longer has you bound 
 This is now 
 This is hope 
 This is the end of a longing 
 The beginning of a road 
 To a change 
 Where everything around you no longer falling down 
 This is now 
 This is now 
 This is now 
 This is hope 
 This is the end of a longing 
 The beginning of a road 
 To a change 
 Where everything around you no longer falling down 
 This is now 
 This is now 
 This is now 
 This is hope 
 This is Jesus 
 This is now

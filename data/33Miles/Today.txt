Worry keeps waking me up 
 Calling me at 3 am 
 Fear wants to shut me down 
 Telling me what might happen 
 Doubt plays with my mind 
 Trying to twist the truth 
 All these distractions, beg a reaction, 
 So here's what I'm gonna do 
 Right here, right now 
 I'm living for You and nothing else 
 Yesterday is history 
 And tomorrow's gonna write itself 
 All I got is the moment I'm in 
 And I don't ever want to waste 
 This gift, this chance, right here, right now 
 Today 
 Joy is what I choose 
 When my blue turns to gray 
 Faith is where I turn 
 When the world says there's no way 
 And peace is what I find 
 Resting in your hands 
 And Your love is more than enough 
 To keep my heart content 
 Right here, right now 
 I'm living for You and nothing else 
 Yesterday is history 
 And tomorrow's gonna write itself 
 All I got is the moment I'm in 
 And I don't ever want to waste 
 This gift, this chance, right here, right now 
 Today 
 I know that You hold 
 The things I can't control 
 So I am letting go 
 Right here, right now 
 I'm living for You and nothing else 
 Yesterday is history 
 And tomorrow's gonna write itself 
 All I got is the moment I'm in 
 And I don't ever want to waste 
 This gift, this chance, right here, right now 
 Today

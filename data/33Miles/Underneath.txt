You've tried so hard, gone too far 
 To cover up who you are 
 Done your best, but no success 
 'Cause deep inside it's still a mess 
 You've held so tight, but don't you know 
 Healing comes when you let go 
 Open up the heart that you hide 
 Everything you locked up inside 
 It's time to come clean 
 Let mercy set you free 
 Take off that heavy disguise 
 Lay it all out in the light 
 The good, the bad, the in between 
 God loves what's underneath 
 You're not alone, 'cause Jesus knows 
 The secrets that you're scared to show 
 And you can run, but when you're done 
 You'll see that you can't outrun love 
 Break the chains, find new hope 
 Freedom comes when you let go 
 Open up the heart that you hide 
 Everything you locked up inside 
 It's time to come clean 
 Let mercy set you free 
 Take off that heavy disguise 
 Lay it all out in the light 
 The good, the bad, the in between 
 God loves what's underneath 
 The smile you try to fake 
 To cover up the pain 
 He holds all your mistakes 
 And then he washes them away 
 He washes them away 
 Open up the heart that you hide 
 Everything you locked up inside 
 It's time to come clean 
 Let mercy set you free 
 Take off that heavy disguise 
 Lay it all out in the light 
 The good, the bad, the in between 
 God loves what's underneath

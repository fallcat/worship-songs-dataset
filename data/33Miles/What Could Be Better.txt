I've heard it said today 
 Is all we're given 
 Tomorrow may not come 
 So you better start living 
 I guess it all depends 
 On your point of view 
 Pardon me if I 
 Just don't listen 
 To everything the world 
 Say's I'm missing 
 There's nothing here and now 
 I'm gonna hold on to 
 I'm living in the days ahead 
 I'm already dancing on the streets of gold 
 Can't stop celebrating in my soul 
 I'm living in the days ahead 
 Nothing on earth could ever compare 
 Can't wait for the day when I get there 
 When I see Jesus face to face 
 Tell me what could be better 
 Tell me what could be better 
 If home is where the heart 
 Is then I'm in Heaven 
 It's the promise of tomorrow 
 That I've been given 
 Who is waiting there I am living for 
 He's everything I love 
 And I believe in 
 And I can hardly wait 
 Just to see Him 
 And hear Him say well done 
 I couldn't ask for more 
 Life is full of ups and downs 
 Inside outs, round and rounds 
 Can't blame me for dreaming about it

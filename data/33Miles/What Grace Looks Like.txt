It's the sun coming out when you didn't expect it 
 Finding your way when you needed direction 
 Everyday 
 We see it in so many ways 
 It's a cold glass of water when you feel thirsty 
 Things working out when you're in a hurry 
 It never ends 
 Like a faithful friend 
 If you wanna know what Grace looks like 
 Let Love open up your eyes 
 It's not that far away 
 You might be amazed 
 It's all around, look and see 
 What God does for you and me 
 Seek and you will find 
 If you wanna know what Grace looks like 
 It's a little bit of hope and sweet redemption 
 Maybe taking time to stop and listen 
 Just being there 
 Show someone that you care 
 It's living a life with your hands wide open 
 Giving all you got to a heart that is broken 
 For heaven's sake 
 Whatever it takes 
 If you wanna know what Grace looks like 
 Let Love open up your eyes 
 It's not that far away 
 You might be amazed 
 It's all around, look and see 
 What God does for you and me 
 Seek and you will find 
 If you wanna know what Grace looks like

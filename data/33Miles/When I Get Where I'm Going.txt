When I get where I'm going 
 On the far side of the sky 
 The first thing that I'm gonna do 
 Is spread my wings and fly 
 I'm gonna land beside a lion 
 And run my fingers through his mane 
 Or I might find out what it's like 
 To ride a drop of rain 
 Yeah when I get where I'm going 
 There'll be only happy tears 
 I will shed the sins and struggles 
 I have carried all these years 
 And I'll leave my heart wide open 
 I will love and have no fear 
 Yeah when I get where I'm going 
 Don't cry for me down here 
 I'm gonna walk with my grand daddy 
 And he'll match me step for step 
 And I'll tell him how I missed him 
 Every minute since he left 
 Then I'll hug his neck 
 Yeah when I get where I'm going 
 There'll be only happy tears 
 I will shed the sins and struggles 
 I have carried all these years 
 And I'll leave my heart wide open 
 I will love and have no fear 
 Yeah when I get where I'm going 
 Don't cry for me down here 
 So much pain and so much darkness 
 In this world we stumble through 
 All these questions I can't answer 
 So much work to do 
 But when I get where I'm going 
 And I see my maker's face 
 I'll stand forever in the light 
 Of his amazing grace 
 Yeah when I get where I'm going 
 There'll be only happy tears 
 Hallelujah 
 I will love and have no fear 
 When I get where I'm going 
 Yeah when I get where I'm going

 When the rain's knocking at your door 
 When it all comes down 
 You gotta have love in it 
 Gotta have truth in it 
 If it's every gonna stand the storm 
 When it all comes down 
 When it all comes down 
 We're not promised tomorrow, all we have is today 
 These are precious moments, don't let them slip away 
 By putting all your trust in things that are built on sand 
 When the wind starts blowing, then you'll understand 
 When it all comes crashing down 
 Too many lives get buried, living in the temporary

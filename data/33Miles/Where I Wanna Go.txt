Sometimes, when I feel like I am falling 
 Your love lifts me up and brings me hope again 
 Sometimes, I close my eyes and imagine 
 You're right here with me, reaching out Your hand 
 Bringing me home 
 That's where I wanna go 
 That's where I wanna stand 
 I don't even have to see it 
 'Cause I know where it's at 
 It's a place that I believe in 
 Where the streets are made of gold 
 Let me tell you how to get there 
 'Cause that's where I wanna go 
 There was a hole inside my heart that was empty 
 Longing for someone to take away the pain 
 But You came and gave me hope for tomorrow 
 That I will be with You and hear You call my name 
 That's where I wanna go 
 That's where I wanna stand 
 I don't even have to see it 
 'Cause I know where it's at 
 It's a place that I believe in 
 Where the streets are made of gold 
 Let me tell you how to get there 
 'Cause that's where I wanna go 
 Yeah, I know I'm never gonna live a day without You 
 Every part of me is thankful that I found You 
 And everything inside of me just knows 
 That's where I wanna go, yeah 
 That's where I wanna go 
 That's where I wanna stand 
 I don't even have to see it 
 'Cause I know where it's at 
 It's a place that I believe in 
 Where the streets are made of gold 
 Let me tell you how to get there 
 'Cause that's where I wanna go 
 That's where I wanna go 
 My heart can't wait to get there 
 Oh, where I wanna go

I can see your heart is yearning 
 Everything is so unclear 
 Is the answer ever coming 
 After all these years 
 It's not an easy feeling 
 Sometimes it seems unfair 
 But He knows just what He's doing 
 With unanswered prayers 
 So hold on 
 It's worth the wait 
 Just keep believing 
 God has perfect timing 
 Never early, never late 
 It takes a little patience 
 And it takes a lot of faith 
 But it's worth the wait 
 What if what you're desperate for 
 Isn't what you really need 
 What if there was something more 
 Than what you dreamed 
 We may not always see 
 We may not understand 
 But He knows just what He's doing 
 He's got a bigger plan 
 So hold on 
 It's worth the wait 
 Just keep believing 
 God has perfect timing 
 Never early, never late 
 It takes a little patience 
 And it takes a lot of faith 
 But it's worth the wait 
 In His time, you'll be fine 
 All this waiting, now, is by design 
 It's worth the wait 
 Just keep believing 
 God has perfect timing 
 Never early, never late 
 It takes a little patience 
 And it takes a lot of faith 
 But it's worth the wait 
 In His time, you'll be fine 
 All this waiting, now, is by design

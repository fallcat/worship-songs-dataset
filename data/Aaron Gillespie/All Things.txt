The ... 
 You keep the things I've broken 
 The silence of a beautiful soul 
 Leaves our fears unspoken 
 You are no stranger here 
 So you are holding 
 All things all things are in your hands (repeats) 
 ... In and off a smile 
 The beauty of the baggers ... 
 The roads you paved with blood and tears 
 Cause you are calling us to be ... 
 You are no stranger here 
 Thought the show was 
 All things all things are in your hands (repeats) 
 ... Beautiful ... wonderful 
 All things are in your hands 
 No lives no deads keep you away 
 To keep you away 
 No doubt no shame 
 Keep us away 
 All things all things are in your hands (repeats)

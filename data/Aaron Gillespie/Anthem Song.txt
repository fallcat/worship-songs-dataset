We seem to oh God feel I could 
 Your love for us will always carry on 
 Your faithfulness is brighter than the dawn 
 The whole universe is echoing your song 
 Here it rise 
 Your anthem we sing 
 You are holy you are holy 
 Before you knee back down 
 You are holy you are holy 
 Oh God 
 Every drop into you're fall down on their knees 
 To you oh God the one and only king 
 My creation ... that your glory be may known 
 And every heart will know you and gotta love you

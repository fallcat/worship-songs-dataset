In life struggles sorrow pain 
 Earnestly I seek thee 
 Feel my soul with ... again 
 Earnestly I seek thee 
 None by you and you alone 
 Take my life make it your own 
 In my offering build your home 
 Earnestly I seek thee 
 In life triumph victorious 
 Earnestly I seek thee 
 In the shadow of the all mighty 
 Earnestly I seek thee 
 None by you and you alone 
 Take my life make it your own 
 In my offering build your home 
 Earnestly I seek thee

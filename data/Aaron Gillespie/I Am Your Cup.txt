Here I am 
 I'm looking for a place to hide 
 Here's my soul 
 Broken and needing a home 
 I need You 
 Will You come in 
 I am Your cup 
 Come fill me with love 
 My heart's in Your hands 
 It's broken for You 
 Oh Lord 
 Here I am 
 I found a safe place to hide 
 In Your arms 
 My soul has found a home 
 I love You 
 I'll let the whole world know 
 I am Your cup 
 Come fill me with love 
 My heart's in Your hands 
 It's broken for You 
 Oh Lord 
 It's broken for You 
 Oh Lord 
 With hands lifted High 
 I'll bless your name 
 With our hearts full of love 
 We will sing Your grace 
 I am Your cup 
 Come fill me with love 
 My heart's in Your hands 
 It's broken for You 
 Oh Lord 
 I am Your cup 
 Come fill me with love 
 My heart's in Your hands 
 It's broken for You 
 Oh Lord 
 Its broken for You 
 Oh Lord 
 It's broken for You 
 Oh Lord

When I am losing 
 When I am broken 
 When I am sinking like a stone 
 And it feels like I am alone 
 I will worship You 
 When I am so scared 
 When I am tired to lose my way 
 When I am feeling so ashamed 
 I will worship You 
 You are the anchor to my soul 
 Draw me to you and soon it go 
 Only love can make me whole 
 Jesus I worship you (repeat) 
 When I am dancing 
 When I am hopeful 
 When I am feeling mercy's hand 
 And I am living life again 
 I will worship you 
 When chains are broken 
 When heal it's coming 
 When you will forgive me ... my heart 
 This is my brand new start 
 I will worship you 
 You are the anchor to my soul 
 Draw me to you and soon it go 
 Only love can make me whole 
 Jesus I worship you (repeat) 
 Alleluia (repeat)

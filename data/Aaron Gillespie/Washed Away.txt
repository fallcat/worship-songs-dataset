Let your water rise till were drowning here 
 In you capsize us in the tide of your grace 
 So let your spirit soar like a banner over us 
 Please God of love come to this place draw us close, 
 Closer than before there's nothing else we want more 
 Just to see your face and to feel your embrace wrap us 
 With your love and mercy; 
 Come fill us cause were so thirsty for your touch 
 God we need you so much let your glory fall like rain; 
 Till were washed, washed away 
 Let your music play we wanna dance with you 
 There's nothing like your song over us so let your children 
 Sing we join the melody and with all of heaven 
 We cry out you are only Lord God Almighty 
 We are desperate, we are so hungry just to see your face 
 And to feel your embrace wrap us with your love and mercy; 
 Come fill us cause were so thirsty for your touch, 
 God we need you so much let your glory fall like rain; 
 Till were washed, washed away 
 Holy holy lord God almighty you were you are 
 And you are to come holy holy lord God almighty 
 You were you are now we come just to see your face 
 And to feel your embrace wrap us with your love and mercy; 
 Come fill us cause were so thirsty for your touch, 
 God we need you so much let your glory fall like rain; 
 Till were washed, washed away you Jesus are washed away, 
 Yea you are washed away, Yea you are washed away

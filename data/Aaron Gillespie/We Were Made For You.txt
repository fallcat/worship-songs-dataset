We come to be with you, Come and bring you 
 Our attention, Our Affection 
 We're here to be with you, Here to bring you 
 Our Offering, Here in this place 
 Deep inside our hearts, We wanna scream it out 
 You are God, You are God, We were made for you, Shout for you 
 You are God, You are God, We will live for you, Everything we do, You are God 
 God of creation, You came from Heaven, 
 You became a man, bringing hope again 
 You laid your life down, Took all of our sin 
 Nailed it to the cross, where you paid it all, 
 Now we bow our hearts, and stand in all 
 You are God, You are God, We were made for you, Shout for you 
 You are God, You are God, We will live for you, Everything we do, You are God 
 There's no one like you, You are the only truth 
 In a world that's so confused, There is no one like you

It doesn't matter who I was 
 It doesn't matter where I've been 
 Your grace is all I am chasing 
 It doesn't matter when I wake 
 It doesn't matter when I sleep 
 Your arms are open for me 
 I am complete cause you say I could breath 
 I am may clean and to You I will sing 
 You are Jesus 
 You are Jesus 
 You are everything I need 
 You are Holy 
 I am dirty 
 In You I am clean 
 You are Jesus 
 You get my brain and it's moving backward 
 You hear my voice when I am screaming 
 You feel my pain so long ago 
 Your paid it all just fallow me

When my head is spinnin round 
 This whole world has brought me down 
 There's one thing I know 
 When my life is screamin loud 
 I look up towards the clouds 
 Your grace lets me know 
 Your grace here lets me know 
 I'm alive because you said 
 I could believe 
 I'm not alone because your 
 Love is everything I need 
 When my world comes crashing down 
 There's just one thing I've found 
 You are You are my everything 
 With everything ounce of my soul 
 I wanna let you know 
 It's in you I'm found 
 With every beat of my heart 
 I know that you're giving me a start 
 One that is brand new 
 Now I'm calling out to you 
 I'm alive because you said 
 I could believe 
 I'm not alone because your 
 Love is everything I need 
 When my world comes crashing down 
 There's just one thing I've found 
 You are You are my everything 
 My everything 
 In my day you're everything 
 In my night you're everything 
 In my world you're everything 
 In my heart you're everything 
 In my soul you're everything 
 In my life you're everything 
 I'm alive because you said 
 I could believe 
 I'm not alone because your 
 Love is everything I need 
 When my world comes crashing down 
 There's just one thing I've found 
 You are You are my everything 
 My everything

Back before the sea 
 Before the skies were blue 
 There was this melody 
 No one could hear but You 
 When the noise has finally disappeared 
 I can hear your anthem loud and clear 
 Your song goes on forever 
 I will sing my part, with my whole heart 
 Your song goes on forever 
 I will bless your name; I will sing your praise 
 Forever 
 Your song goes on forever 
 In my brokenness 
 In my victories 
 Even when I'm lost and scared 
 It still plays inside of me 
 When the noise has finally disappeared 
 I can hear your anthem loud and clear 
 Your song goes on forever 
 I will sing my part, with my whole heart 
 Your song goes on forever 
 I will bless your name; I will sing your praise 
 Forever (Forever) 
 Forever (Forever) 
 Your song goes on forever 
 Praise is rising 
 Eyes are turning 
 I lift my voice to You 
 Praise is rising 
 Eyes are turning 
 I lift my voice to You 
 Your song goes on forever 
 I will sing my part, with my whole heart 
 Your song goes on forever 
 I will sing my part, with my whole heart 
 Your song goes on forever 
 I will bless your name; I will sing your praise 
 Forever (Forever) 
 Forever (Forever) 
 Your song goes on forever 
 Forever

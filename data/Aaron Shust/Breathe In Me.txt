Mercy, in Your tender mercy 
 Look on me, look on me 
 Frailty, even in my frailty 
 Welcome me, welcome me 
 Father this my invocation 
 That You would come and meet me once again 
 Breathe in me, breath of God 
 Mend in me this wounded heart 
 That I may know You've made Your peace with me 
 Breathe in me 
 Burden, take away this burden 
 Set me free, set me free 
 Calling, I heard You calling 
 Out for me, You shout for me 
 Father this my invocation 
 That You would come and meet me once again 
 And I know that You will hear my pleading 
 And You will find me ever once again 
 Breathe in me, breath of God 
 Mend in me this wounded heart 
 That I may know You've made Your peace with me 
 Breathe in me 
 Empty, empty 
 Fill me, Father fill me 
 Empty, I am empty 
 Won't You fill me once again? 
 Breathe in me, breath of God 
 Mend in me this wounded heart 
 That I may know You've made Your peace 
 That I may know You've made Your peace 
 That I may know You've made Your peace with me 
 Breathe in me 
 Grateful, I'm forever grateful

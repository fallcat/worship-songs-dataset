I was lost and I was blind 
 I was begging for a sign 
 That someone 
 Somewhere heard me 
 As You whispered in the wind 
 And You shouted in the waves 
 That You heard me 
 That You loved me 
 And I could finally 
 Stop resisting 
 You're Everything I ever wanted 
 And never knew I needed 
 You're Everywhere I ever go 
 I can't hide from Your Love anymore 
 I begin to drop my guard 
 Faithful as the Morning Star 
 You show me tender mercy 
 I'm surrounded by Your beauty 
 I get lost in Heaven's 
 Symphony 
 It never changes 
 Never ending 
 Unrelenting 
 Why would I want to? 
 I don't want to

Lord, bring me home again 
 I'm no longer able 
 To bare the bitter winds 
 Or the heavy rains 
 I've long been settled 
 Lord, without comfort 
 Just a man on an earthly throne 
 Headed for the grave 
 Carry me home 
 Sweet Jesus, lift me 
 Until I've flown 
 The shadow of shame 
 Your love alone 
 Lord Jesus mends me 
 Lift me up 
 Oh Lord, carry me home 
 Lord, I've been branded 
 A loyal sinner 
 Seems like forever 
 Since I said Your name 
 I'm just a pilgrim 
 Still afraid of dying 
 But the sea is shinning brightly 
 With Your grace 
 Carry me home 
 Sweet Jesus, lift me 
 Until I've flown 
 The shadow of shame 
 Your love alone 
 Lord Jesus mends me 
 Lift me up 
 Oh Lord, carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Sweet Jesus, lift me 
 Until I've flown 
 The shadow of shame 
 Your love alone 
 Lord Jesus mends me 
 Lift me up 
 Oh Lord, carry me home 
 Carry me home 
 Sweet Jesus, lift me 
 Until I've flown 
 The shadow of shame 
 Your love alone 
 Lord Jesus mends me 
 Lift me up 
 Oh Lord, carry me home 
 Lift me up 
 Oh Lord, carry me home

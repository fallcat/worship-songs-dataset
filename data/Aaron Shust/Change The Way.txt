King of all the universe 
 We love You and we come to You know 
 Asking for Your healing touch 
 We need You this very hour 
 Would you help us comprehend what it means to worship You 
 'Cause we're blinded by our circumstance 
 Heal our eyes today 
 May we know Your love; feel it course through our veins 
 Encircling our hearts and embracing our souls 
 We need Your love and grace to remain, to rearrange our hearts 
 And change the way we praise 
 Son of God who took my place 
 We thank You and may we realize 
 You've made us righteous in His sight 
 You took our wrongs and made them right 
 We owe You all of our lives 
 Love me, Father, for I am Your son 
 (And I am Your daughter)

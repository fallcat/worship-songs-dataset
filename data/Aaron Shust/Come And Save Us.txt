The edge of a cliff, the dead end signs 
 That we've been ignoring all this time 
 All our mistakes and crossing lines 
 That sinking feeling that's not far behind 
 We're less than more 
 We're falling short 
 No matter how we try 
 There's nothing we can do 
 Nothing we can do 
 Father, we need You 
 To come and save us 
 If we could see behind the veil 
 Just a glimpse of how 
 You love us when we fail 
 Maybe we would finally see 
 Your mercy never ends 
 There's nothing we can do 
 Nothing we can do 
 Father, we need You 
 To come and save us 
 There's nothing we can do 
 Nothing we can do 
 Father, we need You 
 To come and save us 
 It's all been done 
 It's all been done 
 You have come 
 All for love 
 There's nothing we can do 
 Nothing we can do 
 Father, we need You 
 To come and save us 
 There's nothing we can do 
 Nothing we can do 
 Father, we need You 
 To come and save us 
 Father, we need You 
 To come and save us 
 Father, we need You 
 To come and save us 
 To come and save us

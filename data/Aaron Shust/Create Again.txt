Separated from night 
 You spoke and then there was light 
 They point to You 
 Divided water from land 
 Bowing to Your command 
 They point to You 
 The sun that's blazing at noon 
 And every phase of the moon 
 They point to You. 
 A baby's cry and the way 
 A sunset closes the day 
 They point to You. 
 For You're the only One worth praising 
 More radiant than earth and sky 
 And everyday that I survey Your creation 
 I see why I see why 
 God of everything I see, 
 Come create again in me 
 You were yesterday 
 And You will always be 
 So take each breath that I breathe 
 And be the life that I bleed 
 Create again in me 
 The storm that's raging at sea 
 The little child on her knees 
 They point to You 
 Your grace that's poured out on me 
 The sacrifice on a tree 
 They point to You 
 Your Word vaults across the sky 
 From sunrise to sunset 
 Melting the ice, scorching the desert 
 Warm our hearts to faith 
 (Create again in me)

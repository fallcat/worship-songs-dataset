I hate to be the one to break the news 
 To let you down but I can't lie to you 
 There's things about the world I wish weren't true 
 I guess by now, you must have had a clue 
 It seems you're growing up fast 
 I tried my best to push back 
 Would you believe me if I told you 
 There's no such thing as Peter Pan 
 No such place as Never Never Land 
 I wish we all could have 
 Those tiny magic wings 
 But we live in a world with wars 
 It's not like it was before 
 We won't find our happy ever after here 
 There's no such thing 
 I've dreaded this talk for so long 
 I knew someday you'd wonder what went wrong 
 We get to be the story of it all 
 For the Glory of it all and so we move along 
 This is not where it ends 
 It's just where it begins 
 Would you believe me if I told you 
 There's no such thing as Peter Pan 
 No such place as Never Never Land 
 I wish we all could have 
 Those tiny magic wings 
 But we live in a world with wars 
 It's not like it was before 
 We won't find our happy ever after here 
 It's not where we belong and if it's feeling wrong 
 Oh, you must stay strong 
 'Cause it was here that I first saw your face 
 Every night I pray that you'd believe the same 
 There's no such thing as Peter Pan 
 No such place as Never Never Land 
 I wish we all could have 
 Those tiny magic wings 
 But we live in a world with wars 
 It's not like it was before 
 We won't find our happy ever after here 
 There's no such thing 
 There's no such thing 
 I hate to be the one to break the news 
 To let you down but I can't lie to you

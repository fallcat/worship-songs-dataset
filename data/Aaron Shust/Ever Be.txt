Your love is devoted like a ring of solid gold 
 Like a vow that is tested like a covenant of old 
 Your love is enduring through the winter rain 
 And beyond the horizon with mercy for today 
 Faithful You have been and faithful You will be 
 You pledge Yourself to me and it's why I sing 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 You Father the orphan 
 Your kindness makes us whole 
 And You shoulder our weakness 
 And Your strength becomes our own 
 Now You're making me like You 
 Clothing me in white 
 Bringing beauty from ashes 
 For You will have Your bride 
 Free of all her guilt and rid of all her shame 
 And known by her true name and it's why I sing 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 You will be praised You will be praised 
 With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord 
 You will be praised You will be praised 
 With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord 
 And it's why I sing 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips, ever be on, ever be on my lips

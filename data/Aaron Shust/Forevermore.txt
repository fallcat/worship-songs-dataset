Long before the Earth 
 Before there was light 
 Lord You were 
 Endless are You God 
 No time can contain all you are 
 There's no other God before You 
 There is no one to replace you 
 You are forevermore 
 And there's no other God I call to 
 You are the One that I cling to 
 You are forevermore 
 Faithful are You God 
 You never change 
 Lord You are 
 Only You are God 
 Forever You reign above it all 
 There's no other God before You 
 There is no one to replace You 
 You are forevermore 
 And there's no other God I call to 
 You are the One that I cling to 
 You are forevermore 
 There's no other 
 No one Greater 
 There is none like You 
 There's no other 
 No one Greater 
 There is none like You 
 There's no other God before You 
 There is no one to replace you 
 You are forevermore 
 There's no other God I call to 
 You are the One that I cling to 
 You are forevermore 
 There's no other God before You 
 There is no one to replace you 
 You are forevermore 
 And there's no other God I call to 
 You are the One that I cling to 
 You are forevermore 
 You are forevermore

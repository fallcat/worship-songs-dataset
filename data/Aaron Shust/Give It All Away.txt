Search my heart, search my mind, search my soul 
 Make me clean, make me new make me whole 
 All of my plans, all of my dreams, I lay them down before Your feet 
 All of my time, all that was mine, I now submit to Your design 
 'Cause You are the one who can make my life complete 
 You are the one who can give light to my feet 
 You are the one and only one who dared to give it all away for me 
 You are my strength, You are my God, you are my King 
 You make me laugh, You make me dance, You make me sing 
 Everything inside, everything outside, I give it all away 
 You never change, but You rearrange my heart more everyday

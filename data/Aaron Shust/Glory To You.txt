Great god of might, great god of wonders 
 Giver of life, giver of grace 
 Creator of everything before us 
 You had me in mind before the stars were in place 
 Your love surpasses all by far 
 We're praising You for all you are 
 The reason we're here and the reason we sing 
 Is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king 
 We lift up our hands and we lift up our eyes and sing 
 You are holy 
 The reason we're here and the reason we sing 
 Is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king 
 We lift up our hands and we lift up our minds 
 And we pray that all we do would bring glory to you 
 Father of love. father of mercy 
 What have I done that you would think about me? 
 You've taken my shame, you've taken my sorrow 
 Replaced them with life and life abundantly 
 You can see inside my heart 
 You can see inside my mind 
 So strip away the things 
 That leave me deaf and blind

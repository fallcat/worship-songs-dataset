By the power of Jesus name 
 Strongholds break, strongholds break 
 He's our fortress and our strength 
 God, we will trust in You 
 Heaven moves and darkness quakes 
 When we pray, when we pray 
 He is strong and He will save 
 God, we will trust in You 
 Greater is He that lives in us 
 Than he that is in the world 
 There is no power strong enough to fear 
 He is our firm foundation 
 And our hope has been secured 
 Greater is He that lives in us 
 Than he that is in the world 
 Here and now we will proclaim it 
 Our God saves, our God saves 
 Standing firm, we shout our praises 
 God, we will trust in You 
 Pressing on to take the promise 
 We will praise, we will praise 
 Nothing here can ever harm us 
 God we will trust in you 
 Greater is He that lives in us 
 Than he that is in the world 
 There is no power strong enough to fear 
 He is our firm foundation 
 And our hope has been secured 
 Greater is He that lives in us 
 Than he that is in the world 
 Take heart our God 
 Has overcome the world 
 Take heart our God 
 Has overcome the world 
 Greater is He that lives in us 
 Than he that is in the world 
 There is no power strong enough to fear 
 He is our firm foundation 
 And our hope has been secured 
 Greater is He that lives in us 
 Than he that is in the world 
 Greater is He that lives in us 
 Than he that is in the world

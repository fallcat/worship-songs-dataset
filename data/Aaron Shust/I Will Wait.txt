When I am tired You bring me comfort 
 (I will wait; I will wait for You) 
 When I am weak You give me strength 
 (I will wait; I will wait for You) 
 When I can't walk You give me wings like an eagle 
 (I will wait; I will wait for You) 
 When I'm alone You bring me peace 
 (I will wait) 
 I will wait for Your mercy 
 I will wait for Your plan to unfold 
 I will wait for Your mercies are new every morning 
 When I am wounded You heal my broken bones 
 (I will wait; I will wait for You) 
 And when I sing You fill my heart with joy 
 (I will wait; I will wait for You) 
 And when I fear the unknown You give me peace 
 (I will wait; I will wait for You) 
 And when I call, You always answer me 
 (I will wait) 
 We wait for You like watchmen wait for morning 
 We wait for You like creation waits for spring 
 We wait for You knowing sometimes without warning 
 You reveal Your plan in ways that maybe we don't understand

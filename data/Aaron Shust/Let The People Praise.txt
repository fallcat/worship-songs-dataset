Our God is the God of gods 
 Our Lord is the Lord of kings 
 The revealer of secrets, of mysteries unknown 
 Let the people praise our God 
 His sovereign rule will last forever 
 His kingdom won't decline or fall 
 He does as He pleases both in Heaven and Earth 
 Who am I that I should question Him at all? 
 He lifts up kings and brings them low again 
 He shows us what is right from wrong 
 God of all time we give You thanks and praise 
 For you have made us wise and You have made us strong 
 Everything He does is right and all His ways are just 
 Those who walk in pride He is able to humble

Before the break of dawn 
 My heart cries out to You 
 Where I'm surrounded by my night 
 Here all my weaknesses will wait upon Your mercy 
 The hope of dawn from black to white 
 From black to white 
 I love You more than life itself 
 Lord, You are so good to me 
 I need You more with every breath 
 So won't You breathe some life in me 
 Won't You breathe some life in me 
 Awakening the dawn, with all my heart 
 I sing to You 
 You are the reaSon that I live 
 Under me, over, all around I know You're with me 
 Never condemning: You forgive 
 No matter where I go 
 No matter where I stand 
 Your Spirit always speaks to me 
 And tells me whose I am 
 With every breath I take 
 And every choice I make 
 My heart will always sing to You

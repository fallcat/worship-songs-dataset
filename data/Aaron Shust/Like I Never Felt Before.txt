(Been) training all this time 
 I'm at the starting line 
 A marathon I'm gonna have to run 
 In such a way as if to win the prize 
 And I believe 
 Even though I can't see 
 All the athletes from days gone by 
 Are in the stadium surrounding me 
 And in the days 
 Before the final phase 
 I sacrificed the things that held me down 
 And concentratedly I fixed my gaze. 
 A shot resounds 
 My heart begins to pound 
 And I begin to know what it's like 
 To run as if I had nobody around 
 And I feel like I never felt before 
 I ran through the open door 
 And I feel like I never felt before 
 And it seems You're aware of so much more 
 Than I gave You credit for 
 And I feel like I never felt before 
 Climbing high 
 I can almost touch the sky 
 But every time I'm halfway there 
 I think I'll never reach the top alive 
 But I'm aware 
 I'm safely in Your care 
 And with Your help I'll never face a day 
 That I am unable to bear 
 You taught me to crawl 
 You taught be to stand 
 You taught me run one step at a time 
 And watch out for the quicksand 
 You taught me to live 
 You taught me to die 
 You taught me to spread My wings and how to fly

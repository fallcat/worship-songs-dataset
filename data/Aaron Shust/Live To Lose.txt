Take my life, take it all 
 I lay it at Your throne 
 I am rich, satisfied 
 When I am Yours alone 
 I have learned to live to lose 
 I have found my home in You 
 I count it all as lose, it's true 
 'Cause I have learned to live to lose 
 Precious One, crucified 
 Died to set me free 
 I hold nothing back from You 
 Who gave it all for me 
 I have learned to live to lose 
 I have found my home in You 
 I count it all as lose, it's true 
 'Cause I have learned to live to lose 
 Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me 
 Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me 
 Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me 
 Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me 
 I have learned to live to lose 
 I have found my home in You 
 I count it all as lose, it's true 
 I have learned to live 
 Yes, I have learned to live to lose 
 I have learned to live to lose

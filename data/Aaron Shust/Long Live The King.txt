My heart keeps beating even though I can't control it. 
 My lungs keep breathing I admit I don't know how. 
 Bring the flood or bring the fire in this lifetime 
 I'm ready for the altar or the plough 
 There are always days when I don't feel like singing 
 There are always days when I don't care at all 
 But I know the King of All Creation reigns completely 
 Over every moment great and small 
 Long live the One who gives us 
 Life and peace and hope for tomorrow 
 You've given everything we needed 
 From the palm of Your hand 
 I'll give my everything to the One 
 Who pledged to cancel My sorrow 
 All I have is Yours (Long Live the King) 
 Humbly we approach Your throne of Mercy 
 Aware that we're unworthy of Your Grace 
 (But) You have offered pardon and forgiveness 
 Grievances are gone without a trace 
 You restore our lives even though we don't deserve it 
 And You've given us a love that's not our own 
 You assemble all our broken, shattered pieces: 
 More beautiful than I had ever known 
 You Shall Reign Forever and Ever 
 You Shall Reign, You Shall Reign 
 Forever and Ever and Ever and Ever and

Son of a Man, Great I am, King of heaven, 
 Son of god, you hold the measure of my days 
 Holy Lamb, spotless Lamb, You are worthy, I am not 
 Before Your throne I stand amazed 
 Every tongue confess and every knee will bow 
 To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now 
 Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless 
 Your name means more than I could know 
 You're so far above me, the way that you love me 
 Goes further than any love could go 
 Wonderful Counselor, Root of David, morning star 
 You are the way, the truth, the life 
 Lion of the tribe of judah, Mighty god is who you are 
 The only perfect sacrifice 
 In your name you took the blind man and you gave him back his sight 
 In your name you took the dead man and you brought him back to life 
 In your name you took this prisoner and you opened up the doors 
 And I will sing before your throne forever more

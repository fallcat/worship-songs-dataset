God of unending grace, I come to You on my face 
 I need to hear You speak to me, won't You make me new right now 
 God of omnipotent power, visit us in this hour 
 And may we leave here changed because we1ve met with You, God 
 You've been more wonderful to me than I could have ever imagined 
 You've shown more love than I could show in a thousand years 
 And although it seems at times like it all means nothing to me 
 You gotta know that I love You 
 You gotta know that I need You 
 God of wisdom and love, settle down from above 
 Give us all a taste of what Your Holy Spirit can do 
 Time and time again we've betrayed, but our debt's already been paid 
 And all that leaves me wanting is to live for you, God 
 When the world crashes down around me 
 I know You'll be there to pull me out from the rubble 
 When my enemy surrounds and I call on your name 
 You1ll be there to deliver me from my troubled soul 
 Rescue me from all my selfish ways 
 And thoughts and deeds and plans 
 Lead me in the everlasting way 
 And I will follow you there

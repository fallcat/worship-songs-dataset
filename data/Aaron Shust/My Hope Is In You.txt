I meet with You and my soul sings out 
 As your word throws doubt far away 
 I sing to You and my heart cries 
 "Holy! Hallelujah, Father, You're near!" 
 My hope is in You, Lord 
 All the day long, I won't be shaken by drought or storm 
 A peace that passes understanding is my song 
 And I sing my hope is in You, Lord 
 I wait for You and my soul finds rest 
 In my selfishness, You show me grace 
 I worship You and my heart cries "Glory 
 Hallelujah, Father, You're here!" 
 My hope is in You, Lord 
 All the day long I won't be shaken by drought or storm 
 A peace that passes understanding is my song 
 And I sing my hope is in You, Lord 
 I will wait on You 
 You are my refuge 
 I will wait on You 
 You are my refuge 
 My hope is in You, Lord, all the day long 
 I won't be shaken by drought or storm 
 My hope is in You, Lord 
 All the day long I won't be shaken by drought or storm 
 A peace that passes understanding is my song 
 And I sing my hope is in You, Lord 
 My hope is in You, Lord, yeah 
 My hope is in You, Lord

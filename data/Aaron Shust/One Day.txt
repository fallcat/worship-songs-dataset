One day, I will leave this body 
 And I will get a perfect one 
 That day I will see His glory 
 Shinin' like the noonday sun 
 One day, I'll take a walk with Jesus 
 He might explain the mysteries of life 
 Some say, I just can't believe it 
 But I know that one day 
 We'll gather at the Crystal Throne 
 All these years; we're finally home 
 I can actually see His face 
 And all I can do is say 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 We lay our crowns before You 
 Every heart and soul; adore You 
 The God of gods, Almighty One 
 One day, death will be abolished 
 And sin will have it's mastery no more 
 And I know, that we will be astonished 
 At all that our Creator has in store 
 One day, we will meet our Savior 
 And He will give each one of us a stone 
 Engraved, with our names upon it: 
 Known by God alone 
 We'll gather at the Crystal Throne 
 All these years; we're finally home 
 I can actually see His face 
 I never thought I'd see the day 
 That we'd gather at the Crystal Throne 
 All these years; we're finally home 
 I can actually see His face 
 And all I can do is say 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 We lay our crowns before You 
 Every heart and soul; adore You 
 The God of gods, Almighty One 
 King of Kings, God's only Son 
 Lords of Lords, salvation done.

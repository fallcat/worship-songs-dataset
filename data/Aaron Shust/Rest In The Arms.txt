When you're broken, when you're weak 
 When you turn the other cheek 
 When you cannot speak of the bitter sweet, the bitter sweetness 
 When the floor gives out beneath 
 And everything that you believe cannot bring you peace 
 You're broken inside, broken in pieces 
 You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who knows you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go 
 You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who loves you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go 
 When the waters starts to rise and you've lost the will to fight 
 When you're losing light 
 Just close your eyes, close your eyes now 
 You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who knows you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go 
 You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who loves you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go 
 Have no fear I'll be here 
 You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who knows you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go 
 You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who loves you 
 Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go

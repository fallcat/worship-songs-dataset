Christ the Lord is risen today 
 Hallelujah 
 Sons of man and angels say 
 Hallelujah 
 Raise your joys and triumphs high 
 Hallelujah 
 Sing ye heavens and earth reply 
 Love's redeeming work is done 
 Hallelujah 
 Fought the fight, the battle won 
 Hallelujah 
 Death in vain forbid Him rise 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ has opened paradise 
 Hallelujah, He is risen 
 Hallelujah, our sins have been forgiven 
 Now we have power over the grave 
 Christ the Lord is risen today 
 Lives again our glorious King 
 Hallelujah 
 Where, oh, death is now thy sting? 
 Hallelujah 
 Dying once our souls to save 
 Hallelujah 
 Where thy victory, oh, grave? 
 Oh, Hallelujah, He is risen 
 Hallelujah, our sins have been forgiven 
 Now we have power over the grave 
 Christ the Lord is risen today 
 All creation sing 
 Hallelujah, the King is risen 
 Glory to the name of the Risen Lord 
 Let all the earth proclaim 
 Hallelujah, our sins forgiven 
 Glory to Your name forevermore 
 Hallelujah, He is risen 
 Hallelujah, our sins have been forgiven 
 Now we have power over the grave 
 Christ the Lord is risen today 
 We have power over the grave 
 Christ the Lord is risen today

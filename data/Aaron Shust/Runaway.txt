I would leave My world behind 
 Give up everything that's mine 
 If I could know you 
 I would leave behind My home 
 Enter your world all alone 
 If I could find you 
 It doesn't matter if you run away 
 It doesn't matter if you hide 
 I would leave my world far behind 
 This love inside of Me; it's never gonna die 
 And I don't care how far away you roam 
 No I don't care how far away you roam 
 I'll come running out with open arms to welcome you back home 
 I'll come running out with open arms to welcome you back home 
 I would love to see our name 
 Engraved upon a picture frame 
 On my mantle 
 I would love to see your face 
 Every morning as you wake up 
 To see Me 
 I just wish that I could talk to you 
 Because I love you more than life

When there's no breath in my lungs to scream 
 And there's no strength left inside of me 
 When there's no light that my eyes can see 
 I will say Your name, I will say Your name 
 And stars will fall like rain 
 All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake 
 Every mountain will be moved and cast away 
 At the mention of Your name 
 At the mention of Your name 
 When hope is a long lost friend 
 And the broken that was meant to bend 
 Lift the wounds that were never mend 
 I will say Your name, I will say Your name 
 And stars will fall like rain 
 All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake 
 Every mountain will be moved and cast away 
 At the mention of Your name, oh 
 At the mention of Your name, oh 
 Jesus, I cry, Jesus 
 Jesus, I cry, Jesus 
 And stars will fall like rain 
 All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake 
 Every mountain will be moved and cast away 
 At the mention of Your name, oh 
 And stars will fall like rain 
 All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake 
 Every mountain will be moved and cast away 
 At the mention of Your name 
 At the mention of Your name 
 At the mention of Your name

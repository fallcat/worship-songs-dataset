I've never felt so undeserving 
 Then when You called out for me 
 I've never been more unworthy 
 When You reached down for me 
 I'm lifting hands, stained and dirty 
 To touch my Savior's face 
 And I know now, I am touching grace 
 You see everything I do 
 But still You love me 
 You hear everything that I say 
 But still You want me 
 You know all my darkest secrets 
 That I try so hard to hide 
 You know everything I am 
 But still You love me, still You love me 
 Amazing love, how can it be 
 That You would die for me 
 Amazing grace, oh, the mystery 
 My blinded eyes now see 
 When I fall, when I stumble 
 I struggle to my feet 
 Just to find grace is lifting me 
 You see everything I do 
 But still You love me 
 You hear everything that I say 
 But still You want me 
 You know all my darkest secrets 
 That I try so hard to hide 
 You know everything I am 
 But still You love me 
 There's nothing I can say 
 To make You turn away 
 There's nowhere I can go 
 You're never far away 
 You see everything I do 
 But still You love me 
 You hear everything I say 
 But still You want me 
 You see everything I do 
 But still You love me 
 You hear everything that I say 
 But still You want me 
 You know all my darkest secrets 
 That I try so hard to hide 
 You know everything I am 
 But still You love me, still You love me 
 Still You love me

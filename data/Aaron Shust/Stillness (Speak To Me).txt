I come to you, oh god, in the stillness of my heart 
 I need your healing and your voice in the stillness of my heart 
 Speak to me and show me who you are 
 Rescue me with your unfailing love and mercy 
 Speak to me and show me who you are 
 Hold me tightly in your arms and never let me go 
 I hear you calling out my name in the stillness of my heart 
 Your grace is given me again, now I open my heart 
 I remember singing praises to your name every day with all my might 
 How I long to sing to you again

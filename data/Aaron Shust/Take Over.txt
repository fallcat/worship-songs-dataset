I tried to run 
 I tried to fight You, I'm done 
 I'm giving up 
 I've learned to trust You, Your love 
 Now I'm singing 
 Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me? 
 I've been here over and over again here on my knees 
 I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be 
 When You take over, take over, can You take over me? 
 I tried before 
 To let go and I just hold on more 
 Amazing Lord 
 I need the strength to let go and be Yours 
 So now I'm singing 
 Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me? 
 I've been here over and over again here on my knees 
 I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be 
 When You take over, take over, can You take over me? 
 I surrender all I have 
 And I surrender all I am 
 As I remember 
 What You've done to set me free 
 I just wanna sing 
 Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me? 
 I've been here over and over again here on my knees 
 I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be 
 When You take over, take over, can You take over me? 
 Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me? 
 I've been here over and over again here on my knees 
 I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be 
 When You take over, take over, can You take over me? 
 Take over me 
 Take over me

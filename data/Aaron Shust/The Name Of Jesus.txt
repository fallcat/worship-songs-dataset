At the name of Jesus every knee will bow 
 And every tongue confess Him the King of Glory now 
 It's the Father's pleasure that we should call Him Lord 
 Ho from the beginning was the mighty Word 
 Glory to the Lord on high 
 Glory to the Son who came to earth to die 
 Glory to the Spirit who lifts the name on high: 
 The Name of Jesus, The Name of Jesus 
 At His voice creation sprang at once to sight 
 All the angel faces and all the host of light 
 Thrones and dominations, stars upon their way 
 All the heavenly order, in their great array 
 They sang 
 In Your hearts enthrone Him; there let Him subdue 
 All that is not holy, all that is not true 
 Crown Him as Your Captain, in temptation's hour 
 Let His will enthrall You, in its light and power.

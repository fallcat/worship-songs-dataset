You are the Christ 
 Anointed One 
 Light of the world 
 God's only Son 
 In the beginning was the Word 
 Emmanuel has come to live with us 
 Truly this Man is the Son 
 The Son of God 
 Who takes away the sins of the world 
 This Man is the Lamb 
 The Lamb of God 
 Who takes away the sins of the world 
 This is what we believe 
 You are the Way 
 The Truth and the Life 
 You came to change 
 Our wrongs to right 
 In the beginning was the Word 
 And we must sing of what we've seen and heard 
 We believe that You are God 
 Born to set Your people free 
 Became the final sacrifice 
 Conquered death to bring us life 
 This is what we believe

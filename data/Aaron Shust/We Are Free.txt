We are more than conquerors 
 We don't have to be afraid 
 Nothing is as powerful 
 As His love 
 Oh, the way He gave His Son 
 To give life to everyone 
 Not a thing can separate us 
 From His love 
 It's the life and the hope that He brings 
 His forgiveness that leads us to sing 
 We are free to love 
 Like our God has loved 
 We are free to give like He gave 
 We are free from sin 
 We are free to begin 
 To forgive as He forgave 
 We are free 
 We are living evidence 
 He restores our innocence 
 Jesus stands in our defense 
 All for love 
 It's the grace and the peace that He brings 
 His forgiveness that leads us to sing 
 We are free to love 
 Like our God has loved 
 We are free to give like He gave 
 We are free from sin 
 We are free to begin 
 To forgive as He forgave 
 We are free, we are free 
 Nothing can separate us 
 Nothing can separate us, Lord 
 Nothing can ever take us from You 
 Nothing can separate us 
 Nothing can separate us, Lord 
 Nothing can ever take us from You 
 From You 
 We are free to love 
 Like our God has loved 
 We are free to give like He gave 
 Oh, we are free from sin 
 We are free to begin 
 To forgive as He forgave 
 We are free, we are free, oh yeah

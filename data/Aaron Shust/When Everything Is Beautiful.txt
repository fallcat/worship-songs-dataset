Take my ashes, take my dirt and clay 
 Take my pride and strip it all away 
 Take my mourning, take my doubt and fear 
 Say the words I long to hear 
 Though your sins were as scarlet 
 They will be as white as snow 
 Though they were red, red as crimson 
 They will be like wool 
 When everything is beautiful 
 Everything I tried too hide 
 All the games I've been playing 
 Every secret, every lie 
 All the shame I've been claiming 
 Come and whisper in my ear 
 And say the words I long to hear 
 Though your sins were as scarlet 
 They will be as white as snow 
 Though they were red, red as crimson 
 They will be like wool 
 When everything is beautiful 
 I'm alive with a hope of a brand new day 
 I'm alive with the hope of a brand new day 
 Though your sins were as scarlet 
 They've become as white as snow 
 Though they were red, red as crimson 
 They've become like wool 
 Though your sins were as scarlet 
 They've become as white as snow 
 Though they were red, red as crimson 
 They've become like wool 
 And everything is beautiful 
 Everything is beautiful

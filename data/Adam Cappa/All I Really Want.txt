I can feel it all over my skin 
 It's pouring out from the depths within 
 Like a river running with no end in sight, everything's right 
 You can see it all over my face 
 I don't ever want to leave this place 
 When I'm wrapped in Your embrace 
 I find that the search is through, all that's left to do is fall into 
 Your arms and give You all my heart 
 All I really want is You, nothing better I can find 
 All I really want to do is tell the world that You're mine 
 I've been everywhere and I, I, I know, without You, I have nowhere to go 
 You gave me life and made me new, all I really want is You 
 I can feel it when You say my name 
 Like a fire running through my veins 
 Hasn't stopped since the day my heart was found 
 And everything's changed 
 There's some things that you cannot hide 
 Like the light shining through my eyes 
 You can see it even when I'm miles away 
 The search is through 
 All that's left to do is fall into 
 Your arms and give You all my heart 
 All I really want is You, nothing better I can find 
 All I really want to do is tell the world that You're mine 
 I've been everywhere and I, I, I know without You I have nowhere to go 
 You gave me life and made me new, all I really want is You 
 I give You all away, hanging on every word You say 
 You're all that I've searched for 
 And I will never ask for more 
 Take my heart and chosen every way 
 All I really want is You, nothing better I can find 
 All I really want to do is tell the world that You're mine 
 I've been everywhere and I, I, I know, without You I have nowhere to go 
 You gave me life and made me new, all I really want is You 
 All I really want is You, nothing better I can find 
 All I really want to do is tell the world that You're mine 
 I've been everywhere and I, I, I know, without You I have nowhere to go 
 You gave me life and made me new 
 All I really want is You 
 All I really want is You

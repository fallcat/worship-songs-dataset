Everybody has purpose, everybody has their call 
 Gotta break through the surface, learn to embrace it all 
 Seasons change and I'm running out of time 
 'Cause I've been hesitating, my heart has been invaded 
 It feels like my back's against the wall 
 I'm so sick of standing just to fall 
 I could walk a public road and seem to coast on by 
 I could have it all together well at least on the outside 
 I could talk about the tide and seem to have arrived 
 But I'll never be affected there's a change from the inside 
 Keep your eyes wide open don't give in your own way 
 Every word that's spoken I remind my self everyday 
 Seasons change and I'm running out of time 
 I'm so sick of standing just to fall 
 I could walk a public road and seem to coast on by 
 I could have it all together well at least on the outside 
 I could talk about the tide and seem to have arrived 
 But I'll never be affected there's a change from the inside 
 There's a change from the inside, I need you to change me 
 Won't you change me? I need you to change me 
 'Cause I've been hesitating 
 My heart has been invaded 
 It feels like my back's against the wall 
 It feels like my back's against the wall

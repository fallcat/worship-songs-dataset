Our God is an everlasting God 
 Creator of all that we see 
 From the heavens to the seas 
 You made it all, all that we see 
 How wonderful, powerful is our God 
 How loving, forgiving is the Son 
 How worthy is He 
 How worthy is he 
 He gives strength to the weary 
 And power to the weak 
 Those who are in need 
 He's all we need, he's all we need 
 How worthy is our God 
 How worthy is our God 
 How worthy is our God 
 So worthy, so worthy, so worthy

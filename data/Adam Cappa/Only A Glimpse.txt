I have tasted and seen just a glimpse of your love 
 One little drop in the sea but it's still enough 
 You have been so faithful over and over again, over again 
 You are the one and only hope 
 You are the one and only reason I shout at the top of my lungs 
 I'm boldly declaring how great is your love 
 And all of the wonderful things that you've done is 
 Only a glimpse of what's waiting to come 
 I have seen your strength, I know your peace 
 Even with all that you've done, there's more to see 
 You have been so gracious over and over again, over again 
 You are the one and only hope 
 You're the reason I shout at the top of my lungs 
 I'm boldly declaring how great is your love 
 And all of the wonderful things that you've done is 
 Only a glimpse of what's waiting to come 
 The reason I'm tearing my whole life apart 
 I'm finally free, you have captured my heart 
 There's nothing I need that your love hasn't done 
 It's only a glimpse of what's waiting to come 
 You are the one and only hope 
 You are the one and only reason I shout at the top of my lungs 
 I'm boldly declaring how great is your love 
 And all of the wonderful things that you've done is 
 Only a glimpse of what's waiting to come 
 The reason I'm tearing my whole life apart 
 I'm finally free, you have captured my heart 
 There's nothing I need that your love hasn't done 
 It's only a glimpse of what's waiting to come 
 I know there's more, more than I see 
 My great reward is with you my king 
 My great reward is with you my king 
 My great reward is with you my king

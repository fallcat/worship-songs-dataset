Stop, stop running away, stand up and fight 
 There's no reason to hide your face 
 I know there's pain, just give it time 
 It's easy to say but you're not alone 
 I hope you know there's more than what you're feeling now 
 Stop running away, it's your time to shine 
 No matter what you say, no matter how it seems 
 Want you to know you're perfect to me 
 There's more to who you are, there's more than what you see 
 Want you to know you're perfect 
 Stop, stop living ashamed, your eyes to the ground 
 You gotta lift your head up now 
 Look over the doubt, don't let it keep you down 
 I know it's easy to say but you're not alone 
 I hope you know there's more than what you're feeling now 
 Stop running away, it's your time to shine 
 No matter what you say, no matter how it seems 
 Want you to know you're perfect to me 
 There's more to who you are, there's more than what you see 
 Want you to know you're perfect 
 Just push it all away, every old mistake 
 There's new life to be found 
 Today's another day, another chance to take 
 You're starting over now, over now 
 No matter what you say, no matter how it seems 
 Want you to know you're perfect to me 
 There's more to who you are, there's more than what you see 
 Want you to know you're perfect 
 You're perfect, you're perfect, oh, you're perfect to me 
 There's more to who you are, there's more than what you see 
 Want you to know, want you to know you're perfect 
 Want you to know, oh, you're perfect to me

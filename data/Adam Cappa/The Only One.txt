Sometimes it feels so hard to breathe 
 Like ten thousand pounds on top of me 
 I'll finally break and slowly wake 
 And sometimes I stay so out of reach 
 But still You stay so close to me 
 No more hiding, I'm so tired of fighting 
 You're the only one I can run to 
 When I put up the walls You break through 
 I can make it through 
 No matter what, if I just let go 
 You're the only one I can trust in 
 When everything around me is falling 
 I can make it through no matter what 
 You're the only one, only one I need to run to 
 Sometimes I make it hard to see 
 The beautiful life You've given me 
 But I won't waste it, I was made to embrace it 
 All the mystery, every heartbreak 
 There so many things I'll never understand 
 But I still trust Your loving hands 
 You're the only one I can run to 
 When I put up the walls You break through 
 I can make it through 
 No matter what, if I just let go 
 You're the only one I can trust in 
 When everything around me is falling 
 I can make it through no matter what 
 You're the only one, only one I need to run to 
 I don't want to fill this space 
 With empty words, with empty faith 
 You're the only real escape 
 No one else can take Your place 
 You're the only one I can run to 
 When I put up the walls You break through 
 I can make it through 
 No matter what, if I just let go 
 You're the only one I can trust in 
 When everything around me is falling 
 I can make it through no matter what 
 You're the only one, only one I need to run to 
 I need to run to, I need to run to 
 You're the only one

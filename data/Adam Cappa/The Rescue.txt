Have you ever lost your way 
 Getting by with no direction 
 Living always so afraid 
 Of the fear that fills your mind 
 And you could go on and on and on like this 
 But you'll never find that peace exists 
 You don't have to be, you don't have to be alone 
 There's a better way, it's never to late to say 
 I need you right now, here in this moment 
 I'm losing ground, can't keep going 
 I'm calling out for you to rescue me 
 Don't want to drown right now here in this ocean 
 I'm so far down, can't keep moving 
 This time around, I'm keeping my eyes on you 
 You are the rescued 
 You are the rescued 
 Is it hard to find your words 
 To say what you've been thinking 
 Have you taken what's not yours 
 Blinded by your desperation 
 You could go on and on and on like this 
 But you'll never find a love like His 
 You don't have to be 
 You don't have to be alone, oh 
 I need you right now, here in this moment 
 I'm losing ground, can't keep going 
 I'm calling out for you to rescue me 
 Don't want to drown right now here in this ocean 
 I'm so far down, can't keep moving 
 This time around 
 I'm keeping my eyes on you 
 You are the rescued 
 Whoa, whoa, I need you, I need you 
 Whoa, whoa, my rescued, my rescued 
 And I need you right now, here in this moment 
 I'm losing ground, can't keep going 
 I'm calling out for you to rescue me 
 Don't want to drown right now, here in this ocean 
 I'm so far down, can't keep moving 
 This time around, I'm keeping my eyes on you, you, you 
 I need you right now, here in this moment 
 I'm losing ground, can't keep going 
 I'm calling out for You to rescue me 
 Don't want to drown right now here in this ocean 
 I'm so far down, can't keep moving 
 This time around, I'm keeping my eyes on you 
 You are the rescued 
 You are the rescued, you are the rescued

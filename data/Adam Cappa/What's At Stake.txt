A million faces everywhere, a million reasons not to care 
 I get so caught up inside my own little world 
 Choosing what I want to hear seems I'm bound by my own fear 
 Desperate for a change, so why am I just sitting here? 
 While everyone is searching for a truth we found 
 Why do we keep it secret even from the ones we love? 
 Are we too afraid to speak up? 
 And I don't know why we let lives pass us by 
 Can't we see all that's been broken inside? 
 And I'm so tired of another selfish day's end 
 These people who are lost will face eternity one day 
 Can't we see what's at stake? 
 Another day has come and gone, another life confused 
 And lost, I have been so silent for far too long 
 It's up to me to share the hope that I have found 
 And I don't know why we let lives pass us by 
 Can't we see all that's been broken inside? 
 And I'm so tired of another selfish day's end 
 These people who are lost will face eternity one day 
 Can't we see what's at stake? 
 Sooner or later, this world will end 
 Nothing else will matter but the life we've lived 
 One day we will stand before the throne 
 And answer to the one whose name is love 
 And I don't know why we let lives pass us by 
 Can't we see all that's been broken inside? 
 And I'm so tired of another selfish day's end 
 These people who are lost will face eternity one day 
 And I don't know why we let lives pass us by 
 Can't we see all that's been broken inside? 
 And I am so tired of another selfish day's end 
 These people who are lost, will face eternity one day 
 Can't we see what's at stake? Can't we see what's at stake? 
 There's so much at stake

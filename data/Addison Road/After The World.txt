If everything comes down to love 
 Then just what am I afraid of 
 When I call out Your name 
 Something inside awakes in my soul 
 How quickly I forget I'm Yours 
 I'm not my own 
 I've been carried by You 
 All my life 
 Everything rides on hope now 
 Everything rides on faith somehow 
 When the world has broken me down 
 This love sets me free 
 When my life is like a storm 
 Rising waters all I want is the shore 
 You say I'll be ok and 
 Make it through the rain 
 You are my shelter from the storm 
 I'm not my own 
 I've been carried by You 
 All my life 
 Everything rides on hope now 
 Everything rides on faith somehow 
 When the world has broken me down 
 This love sets me free 
 Everything rides on hope now 
 Everything rides on faith somehow 
 When the world has broken me down 
 Your love sets me free 
 You define my heart's desires 
 I will sing Your praises higher 
 'Cause Your love sets me free 
 Your love sets me free 
 Your love sets me free

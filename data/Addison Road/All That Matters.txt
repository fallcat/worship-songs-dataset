I may never be the one that gets a second glance 
 I may never be the one they call the prettiest 
 But that's alright with me 
 And maybe I don't follow every crazy passion 
 Spend all my time trying to get a good reaction 
 But that's okay with me 
 This world is like a trampoline 
 High and low no in between 
 Jumping at the chance to please 
 Everyone but that's not me 
 Cause all that matters is 
 All that matters is 
 I know your love has set me free 
 And that's all that matters to me 
 Some people tell me to step out and do my own thing 
 And others say I got to blend in just to be the same 
 And stop being me 
 But this shallow world is no longer what I'm made of 
 I've been changed by grace 
 I've been saved by love 
 What more do I need 
 My life comes from the One 
 Who made the stars and brought the sun 
 He loves me more than these 
 So I don't need another identity

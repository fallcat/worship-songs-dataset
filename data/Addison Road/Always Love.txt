To make a mountain of your life 
 Is just a choice 
 But I never learned enough 
 To listen to the voice that told me 
 Always love, Hate will get you every time 
 Always love, Don't wait till the finish line 
 Slow demands come 'round 
 Squeeze the air and keep the rest out 
 It helps to write it down 
 Even when you then cross it out 
 But Always Love, Hate will get you every time 
 Always Love, Even when you wanna fight 
 Self-directed lives 
 I want to know what it'd be like to 
 Aim so high above 
 Any card that you've been dealt, you... 
 Always Love, Hate will get you every time 
 Always Love, Hate will get you- 
 I've been held back by something 
 Yeah. You said to me quietly on the stairs, 
 I've been held back by something 
 Yeah. You said to me quietly on the stairs. 
 You said, 
 Hey, you good ones. 
 Hey, you good ones. 
 To make a mountain of your life 
 Is just a choice 
 But I never learned enough

 Always love, hate will get you every time 
 Always love, hate will get you- 
 I've been held back by something 
 Yeah, You said to me quietly on the stairs, 
 I've been held back by something 
 Yeah, You said to me quietly on the stairs 
 You said... 
 Hey, you good ones 
 Hey, you good ones 
 Hey, you good ones

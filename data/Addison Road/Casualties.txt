He sees his life just pass by 
 Just another number in a suit and tie 
 No purpose here nothing to give 
 Is this what it means to really live? 
 His feet never touch the ground 
 His days fly by, he can't slow down 
 Casualties of the American dream 
 Have we lost our vision 
 Drifting off and living 
 Half asleep with a faint heartbeat 
 Just dying to be revived 
 I want to be revived 
 She's screaming out,"I've lost control" 
 Caught in another undertow 
 She's only barely hanging on 
 Been holding her breath for so long 
 Her feet never touch the ground 
 She's not sure which way is up or down 
 Casualties of the American dream 
 Have we lost our vision 
 Drifting off and living 
 Half asleep with a faint heartbeat 
 Just dying to be revived 
 I want to be revived 
 I want to feel alive 
 And in a world so numb 
 Don't let me become another 
 Casualty living in a dream 
 Casualties of the American dream 
 Have we lost our vision 
 Drifting off and living 
 Half asleep with a faint heartbeat 
 Just dying to be revived 
 I want to be revived 
 I want to be revived

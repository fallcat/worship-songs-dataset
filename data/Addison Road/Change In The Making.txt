There's a better version of me 
 That I can't quite see 
 But things are gonna change 
 Right now I'm a total mess and 
 Right now I'm completely incomplete 
 But things are gonna change 
 'Cause you're not through with me yet 
 This is redemption's story 
 With every step that I'm taking 
 Every day, you're chipping away 
 What I don't need 
 This is me under construction 
 This is my pride being broken 
 And every day I'm closer to who I'm meant to be 
 I'm a change in the making 
 Wish I could live more patiently 
 Wish I would give a little more of me 
 Without stopping to think twice 
 Wish I had faith like a little child 
 Wish I could walk a single mile 
 Without tripping on my own feet 
 But you're not through with me yet 
 This is redemption's story 
 With every step that I'm taking 
 Every day, you're chipping away 
 What I don't need 
 This is me under construction 
 This is my pride being broken 
 And every day I'm closer to who I'm meant to be 
 From the dawn of history 
 You make new and you redeem 
 From a broken world to a broken heart 
 You finish what you start in everything 
 Like a river rolls into the sea 
 We're not who we're going to be 
 But things are going to change 
 This is redemption's story 
 With every step that I'm taking 
 Every day, you're chipping away 
 What I don't need 
 This is me under construction 
 This is my pride being broken 
 And every day I'm closer to who I'm meant to be 
 I'm a change in the making

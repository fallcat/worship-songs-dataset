Today I lost a friend of mine 
 I never even got to say goodbye 
 I thought we had time to burn 
 But life is short you only get one turn 
 Oh gone before you know 
 Oh so make the most 
 We're not indestructible 
 Our lives, unpredictable 
 It can turn on a dime so now is the time 
 Don't wait, don't wait, don't wait 
 Gotta live today 
 So here I am wide awake 
 Blinded by a brand new day 
 Every breath given to me is a gift I want to redeem 
 Oh the minutes they unwind 
 Oh so I gotta make the time 
 ' 
 Cause We're not indestructible 
 Our lives, unpredictable 
 It can turn on a dime so now is the time 
 Don't wait, don't wait, don't wait 
 Gotta live today 
 In the blink of an eye 
 You snap and time goes by, time goes by 
 We'll wonder where it went 
 If we forget, so don't forget 
 We're not indestructible 
 Our lives, unpredictable 
 It can turn on a dime so now is the time 
 Don't wait, don't wait, don't wait 
 Gotta live today

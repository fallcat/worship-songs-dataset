Your broken dreams, your crazy schemes 
 They always let you down 
 The things we chase, a hopeless race 
 You're breathless on the ground 
 From soaring heights to crashing dives 
 A peace yet to be found 
 But you could spend a lifetime running 
 You could spend a lifetime running 
 And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot 
 Are you living every day like it's the last you've got 
 Will you step aside when it all falls down and watch it burn away 
 Have a little faith when the walls cave in 
 Pray for strength to fly against the wind 
 Will you walk away when the fire gets hot 
 Or fight another 
 Another day 
 Your fractured heart, your disregard 
 It leaves you frozen still 
 A slow withdrawal from it all 
 That keeps you unfulfilled 
 Will you spend a lifetime running 
 'Cause you could spend a lifetime running 
 And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot 
 Are you living every day like it's the last you've got 
 Will you step aside when it all falls down and watch it burn away 
 Have a little faith when the walls cave in 
 Pray for strength to fly against the wind 
 Will you walk away when the fire gets hot 
 Or fight another 
 Another day 
 Even when your heart's been broken 
 He'll be there with arms wide open 
 Be strong and his love will lead you 
 To fight another day 
 Keep your head to the sun 'cause it's shining on you, on you

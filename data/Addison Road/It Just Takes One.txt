What if we moved 
 What if we wandered 
 Took a reckless ride to the other side 
 Of the tracks 
 What if we knew somebody's story 
 Would we write them off like a number 
 On a check 
 Or could we be the only souls 
 Who take the time to love and find 
 The beauty in a nameless face 
 One, it just takes one 
 To step out from the crowd, and show 
 What love is all about 
 One, it just takes one 
 To change a life forever, 
 Touch the world and make it better 
 So what if we moved with no hesitations 
 And learn to love the least of these without reserve 
 Let's spark a change in this generation 
 And let our actions speak louder than our words 
 And what if there's a world in need of hope 
 That only we can bring 
 Brighter then the midday sun 
 One, it just takes one 
 To step out from the crowd, and show 
 What love is all about 
 One, it just takes one 
 To change a life forever, 
 Touch the world and make it better 
 It just takes one 
 It just takes one 
 It just takes one 
 One, it just takes one 
 To step out from the crowd, and show 
 What love is all about 
 One, it just takes one 
 To change a life forever, 
 Touch the world and make it better 
 One, it just takes one 
 To step out from the crowd, and show 
 What love is all about 
 One, it just takes one 
 To change a life forever, 
 Touch the world and make it better

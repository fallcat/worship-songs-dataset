This is not another song about the reasons I am stressed 
 This is not a melody to get the feelings off my chest 
 This is not a pop song written for the radio 
 These are just my thoughts and what I'm praying for 
 If this is my story, if this is my song 
 Then I want to be a part of something beautiful 
 If this is my journey, then show me Your road 
 Wherever you lead me in this world I want to go 
 There's just too many times I only think of me 
 'Cause I get so consumed with my opportunities 
 When my last breath brings me to the feet of God 
 I want to hear him say I lived for his glory 
 If this is my story, if this is my song 
 Then I want to be a part of something beautiful 
 If this is my journey, then show me Your road 
 Wherever you lead me in this world I want to go 
 Colors paint the evening sky 
 The sun is shining giving light 
 Stars light up the atmosphere 
 But we're the reason God came here 
 We are his story, we are his song 
 A beautiful melody that shows the world his love 
 When we're on this journey, when we're on this road 
 We are a part of the greatest story ever told

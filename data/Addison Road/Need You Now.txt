I've been trying to win 
 Trying to fend for myself way too long 
 Living in doubt, living without, I've been so alone 
 I know that I need you, I know that I need you now 
 I was wasting my time trying to find 
 Something real for my soul 
 And now that I'm here, you're making it clear 
 I'm not my own 
 And I know that I need you, I know that I need you now 
 Now, this is all that I am 
 Here, with my outstretched hands 
 'Cause I really need You 
 I know that I need You now 
 I'm running in place to try and erase all that I've done 
 But you find a way to replace my pain with love 
 And I know that I need you, I know that I need you now 
 Now, this is all that I am 
 Here, with my outstretched hands 
 'Cause I really need You 
 I know that I need You now 
 When I'm afraid, You comfort me 
 When I'm ashamed, You lift me up 
 Yeah You lift me up 
 Now, this is all that I am 
 Here, with my outstretched hands 
 'Cause I really need You 
 I know that I need You now 
 Now, this is all that I want 
 Here, is where I belong 
 Now, I'm giving You everything now 
 When I'm afraid, You comfort me 
 When I'm ashamed, You show me how 
 I need You now

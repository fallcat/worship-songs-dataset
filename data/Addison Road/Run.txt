Stoplights, breakdown, we cry, last try 
 Worlds collide, time to decide 
 Where you want to go in this great big world 
 Where you want to go in this great big world 
 Stuck here too long in this sad song 
 Lost in a street, everyone has 
 Vanished and you're all alone 
 But you don't know where to go 
 Yeah you're all alone 
 And you want to go home 
 Run just as fast as you can 
 Run, 'til you reach the end 
 Where the fallen finally land 
 And your world starts over again 
 Run 
 Next page, new day, finding my way 
 Stumble upon the strength to move on 
 I am not alone in this great big world 
 And you are not alone in this great big world 
 Run just as fast as you can 
 Run, 'til you reach the end 
 Where the fallen finally land 
 And your world starts over again 
 Run 
 Run now don't you look back 
 Run towards the light straight ahead 
 Where the lost souls make a beautiful sound 
 And new life is finally found 
 Run 
 Your free, free falling 
 A new beginning 
 This is our time 
 Run just as fast as you can 
 Run, 'til you reach the end 
 Where the fallen finally land 
 And your world starts over again 
 Run now don't you look back 
 Run towards the light straight ahead 
 Where the lost souls make a beautiful sound 
 And new life is finally found 
 Run

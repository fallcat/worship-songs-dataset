Going on my way 
 Packing up today 
 I can't live a life with this way of thinking 
 'Cause I know what's right 
 I'm gonna leave tonight 
 And put all the past behind me 
 Show me life 
 Bigger than I've known 
 I want to feel more than alive 
 Show me love 
 Beautiful and true 
 Change the old to new inside 
 Show me life 
 Can I fall apart 
 Right into your arms 
 Open my eyes to the road that leads beyond my heart, oh 
 Show me life 
 Bigger than I've known 
 I want to feel more than alive 
 Show me love 
 Beautiful and true 
 Change the old to new inside 
 Show me life 
 Going on my way 
 Packing up today 
 Can I fall apart 
 And let go in your arms 
 Show me life 
 Bigger than I've known 
 I want to feel more than alive 
 Show me love 
 Beautiful and true 
 Change the old to new inside 
 Show me life

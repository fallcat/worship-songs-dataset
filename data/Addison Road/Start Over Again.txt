Open up your eyes 
 Awake, arise 
 Love like a hand reaches down 
 And pulls us up from the dirty ground 
 Now is the time 
 To step from the dark into the light 
 Cause you can't change what you've done 
 But you can choose who you'll become 
 Every moment is a second chance 
 At starting over, at starting over 
 Move from the past to the present tense 
 You can start over, start over again 
 If you feel ashamed 
 Of the choices that you've made 
 You can be whole again 
 And return to your innocence 
 Every moment is a second chance 
 At starting over, at starting over 
 Move from the past to the present tense 
 You can start over, start over again 
 Yesterday is gone 
 Today is all you've got 
 You don't have to be who you've been 
 You can change within 
 It's never too late 
 To start over again 
 Every moment is a second chance 
 At starting over, at starting over 
 Move from the past to the present tense 
 You can start over, start over again

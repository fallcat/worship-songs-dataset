Come on, it's me you're talking to 
 There's something going on inside of you 
 Don't have to say it 
 But I wish you would 
 Cause it would be much easier 
 You always hide behind yourself 
 You walk a lonely road with no one's help 
 I hate to break the news 
 You're headed for a fall 
 And if I have to jump, then I'll jump 
 And I won't look down 
 You can cry, you can fight 
 You can scream and shout 
 I'll push and pull until your walls come down 
 And you understand I'm gonna be around 
 I'm sticking with you 
 Sticking with you 
 Even if you try and shut me out 
 I'm staying here, 'cause that's what love's about 
 I might let you down, but I won't let you go 
 So lean into me, I want to know 
 Everything about the fear you hold 
 Inside, cause you and I are better than just one 
 That's what it means to love you 
 That's what it means to have your back 
 That's what it means to show you

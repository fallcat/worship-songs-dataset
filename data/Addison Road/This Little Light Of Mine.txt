There's a little flame inside us all 
 Some shine bright, some shine small 
 The rains will come and the waters rise 
 But don't you ever lose your light 
 In this life you will know 
 Love and pain, joy and sorrow 
 So when it hurts, when times get hard 
 Don't forget whose child you are 
 This little light of mine 
 I'm gonna let it shine 
 This little light of mine 
 I'm gonna let it shine, gonna let it shine 
 May you live each day with no regret 
 Make the most of every chance you get 
 Let your eyes get wide when you look at the stars 
 With the same sense of wonder as a child's heart 
 With the ones you love treasure the time 
 And for those who are gone keep their memories alive 
 Hold on to your dreams don't ever let go 
 There's a fire inside you burning with hope 
 This little light of mine 
 I'm gonna let it shine 
 This little light of mine 
 I'm gonna let it shine, gonna let it shine 
 There will be days when you want to give up 
 When the clouds settle in 
 But after the rain comes the sun 
 Don't you ever forget 
 One day there will be no more pain 
 And we will finally see Jesus' face 
 So until then I'm gonna to try 
 To brave the dark and let my little light shine 
 This little light of mine 
 I'm gonna let it shine 
 This little light of mine 
 I'm gonna let it shine, gonna let it shine 
 There's a little light inside us all

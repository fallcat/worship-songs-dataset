I made You promises a thousand times 
 I tried to hear from Heaven 
 But I talked the whole time 
 I think I made You too small 
 I never feared You at all No 
 If You touched my face would I know You? 
 Looked into my eyes could I behold You? 
 So What do I know of You 
 Who spoke me into motion? 
 Where have I even stood 
 But the shore along Your ocean? 
 Are You fire? Are You fury? 
 Are You sacred? Are You beautiful? 
 So What do I know? What do I know of Holy? 
 I guess I thought that I had figured You out 
 I knew all the stories and I learned to talk about 
 How You were mighty to save 
 Those were only empty words on a page 
 Then I caught a glimpse of who You might be 
 The slightest hint of You brought me down to my knees 
 So What do I know of You 
 Who spoke me into motion? 
 Where have I even stood 
 But the shore along Your ocean? 
 Are You fire? Are You fury? 
 Are You sacred? Are You beautiful? 
 So What do I know? What do I know of Holy? 
 What do I know of Holy? 
 What do I know of wounds that will heal my shame? 
 And a God who gave life it's name? 
 What do I know of Holy? 
 Of the One who the angels praise? 
 All creation knows Your name 
 On earth and heaven above 
 What do I know of this love? 
 So What do I know of You 
 Who spoke me into motion? 
 Where have I even stood 
 But the shore along Your ocean? 
 Are You fire? Are You fury? 
 Are You sacred? Are You beautiful? 
 What do I know? What do I know of Holy? 
 What do I know of Holy? 
 What do I know of Holy?

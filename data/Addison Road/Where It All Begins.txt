Twenty-nine and I'm going back to the basics 
 Finding love making peace having a little more patience 
 I want to love somebody more than myself 
 'Cause it would do some good for my mental health 
 To take a backseat 
 Remember everything you taught me 
 I need you to 
 Show me how to feel again 
 I come to You with open hands 
 Teach me to be real again 
 Take me back to where it all begins 
 Slowing down tuning out all the noise just to hear Your voice 
 Sounds simple enough I know but it's a daily choice 
 I want to love when it's costly, be quick to forgive 
 Run to the one who calls me to live 
 Show me how to feel again 
 I come to You with open hands 
 Teach me to be real again 
 Take me back to where it all begins

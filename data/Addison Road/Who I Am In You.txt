Secrets they were killing me 
 Pulled me under in too deep 
 All those shadows they don't let go easily 
 But everything I covered up 
 Is opening inside your love 
 Let Your grace illuminate the heart in me 
 Oh You're bringing me to life 
 I'm finding who I am in You, who I am in You 
 Oh, you're changing me inside 
 And I'm finding who I am in You, who I am in You 
 Breathe Your breath into my soul 
 Let my heart beat with Your own 
 I need Your mercy even when it hurts 
 Please shine on me 
 Shine on me 
 Oh You're bringing me to life 
 I'm finding who I am in You, who I am in You 
 Oh, You're changing me inside 
 And I'm finding who I am in You, who I am in You 
 And if there's anything I try to hide 
 I pray that you would bring it to the light 
 Strip away the lies if I pretend 
 Teach me how to be a child again 
 Resting in your arms, resting in your arms 
 And I can feel your love changing me 
 Oh You're bringing me to life 
 I'm finding who I am in You, who I am in You 
 Oh, I finally realize 
 That I'm finding who I am in You, who I am in You

Welcome to my latest disaster 
 Same book just another chapter 
 I never thought it could be worse than last year 
 But here I am again today 
 I laugh 'cause it hurts when I scream 
 But I'll make it through 'cause I believe 
 That even when my heart breaks 
 And everything's shaken 
 I'm left alone in the rain 
 You won't, You won't, won't 
 You won't let me go 
 When life's insane 
 And everything's crazy 
 You carry me through the pain 
 And You won't, You won't, won't 
 You won't let me go 
 Here we go it's a three-ring circus 
 Juggling it all, trying to find my purpose 
 With each new day, I'm praying just to make it through 
 When my next disaster is near 
 I know that you'll meet me right here 
 So I won't fear 
 That even when my heart breaks 
 And everything's shaken 
 I'm left alone in the rain 
 You won't, You won't, won't 
 You won't let me go 
 When life's insane 
 And everything's crazy 
 You carry me through the pain 
 And You won't, You won't, won't 
 You won't let me go 
 I feel your love that surrounds me 
 My world can shake but it won't drown me 
 'Cause I'm trusting you 
 No matter what I'm going through 
 That even when my heart breaks 
 And everything's shaken 
 I'm left alone in the rain 
 You won't, You won't, won't 
 You won't let me go 
 When life's insane 
 And everything's crazy 
 You carry me through the pain 
 And You won't, You won't, won't 
 You won't let me go

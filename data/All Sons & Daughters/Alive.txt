This is a call to all the dead and disappointed 
 The ones who feel like they are done 
 This is a word to all the ones who feel forgotten 
 But you are not, oh, you are not 
 'Cause we're alive, alive, alive and we're singin' 
 We're alive, alive, alive and we're shaken 
 We're alive, alive, alive, alive in You 
 We are soaked in all the grace that we've been given 
 Unchained from all that we have done 
 Your mercy's rising like the sun on the horizon 
 And we're comin' home, we're comin' home 
 'Cause we're alive alive alive and we're singin' 
 We're alive, alive, alive and we're shaken 
 We're alive, alive, alive, alive in You 
 'Cause we're alive alive alive and we're singin' 
 We're alive, alive, alive and we're shaken 
 We're alive, alive, alive, alive in You

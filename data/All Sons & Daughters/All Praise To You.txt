Though the world could not contain Your holiness 
 You made a way, You made the way 
 The veil was torn and we stand before You now 
 In Your glory we're amazed, by Your glory we're amazed 
 All glory, all honor, all praise to You 
 All glory, all honor, all praise to You 
 By the blood of Christ our lives been renewed 
 Redeemed and holy now, we're redeemed and holy now 
 With hearts on fire Lord, You dwell inside of us 
 In Your glory we're amazed, by Your glory we're amazed 
 All glory, all honor, all praise to You 
 All glory, all honor, all praise to You 
 Hear our cries, Lord 
 Come shake these walls 
 Rattle the steeples 
 Lord, we are Your people 
 All glory, all honor 
 All praise, all praise to You 
 All glory, all honor, all praise to You 
 All glory, all honor, all praise to You

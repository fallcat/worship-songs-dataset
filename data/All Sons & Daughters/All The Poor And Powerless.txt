All the poor and powerless 
 And all the lost and lonely 
 All the thieves will come confess 
 And know that You are holy 
 And know that You are holy 
 And all will sing out 
 Hallelujah 
 And we will cry out 
 Hallelujah 
 All the hearts who are content 
 And all who feel unworthy 
 And all who hurt with nothing left 
 Will know that You are holy 
 And all will sing out 
 Hallelujah 
 And we will cry out 
 Hallelujah 
 Shout it 
 Go on scream it from the mountains 
 Go on and tell it to the masses 
 That He is God 
 We will sing out 
 Hallelujah 
 And we will cry out 
 Hallelujah

Almighty God 
 To You all hearts are open 
 Search and know 
 Our thoughts and anxious fears 
 Wash us in the fountain 
 Of Your mercy 
 Come with Your light 
 We cannot hide from You 
 Almighty God 
 To You all hearts are open 
 With gratitude 
 We raise our song to You 
 Come and fill 
 The praises of Your people 
 In grace and truth 
 You make us new again 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Almighty God 
 To You all hearts are open 
 We long for more 
 Than what this world provides 
 No shallow spring 
 Will ever satisfy us 
 But Your river deep 
 Floods over everything 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Almighty God 
 To You all hearts are open 
 You take away 
 Our sickness and our sin 
 Oh Lamb of God 
 We gather at Your table 
 In bread and wine 
 You have supplied our needs 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Almighty God 
 To You all hearts are open

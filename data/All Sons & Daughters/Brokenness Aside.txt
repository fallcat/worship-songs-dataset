Will your grace run out 
 If I let you down 
 'Cause all I know 
 Is how to run 
 'Cause I am a sinner 
 If it's not one thing it's another 
 Caught up in words 
 Tangled in lies 
 But You are a Savior 
 And You take brokenness aside 
 And make it beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Will You call me child 
 When I tell you lies 
 'Cause all I know 
 Is how to cry 
 'Cause I am a sinner 
 If it's not one thing it's another 
 Caught up in words 
 Tangled in lies 
 But You are a Savior 
 And You take brokenness aside 
 And make it beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 You make it beautiful 
 You make it beautiful 
 'Cause I am a sinner 
 If it's not one thing it's another 
 Caught up in words 
 Tangled in lies 
 But You are a Savior 
 And You take brokenness aside 
 And make it beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 I am a sinner 
 If it's not one thing it's another 
 Caught up in words 
 Tangled in lies, oh yeah 
 But You are a Savior 
 And You take brokenness aside 
 And make it beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 You make it beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 You make it beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 You make it beautiful 
 You make it beautiful

There was a day we held our breath 
 And felt the sting of bitter death 
 When all our hopes were buried in the grave 
 Our eyes awake, our hearts were torn 
 Between our faith and what we knew 
 Before our King was buried in the grave 
 And grace was in the tension 
 Of everything we've lost 
 Standing empty handed 
 Shattered by the cross 
 All we have, all we had 
 Was a promise like a thread 
 Holding us, keeping us 
 Oh, from fraying at the edge 
 All we knew, all we knew 
 Was You, said You'd come again 
 You'd rise up from the dead 
 There was a day we looked for proof 
 That You had risen from the tomb 
 And all our doubts began to roll away 
 We touched the scars upon Your hands 
 You kept Your word, oh son of man 
 You buried death by taking on the grave 
 You came here to save us 
 'Cause everything was lost 
 No longer empty handed 
 Clinging to the cross 
 All we have, all we had 
 Was a promise like a thread 
 Holding us, keeping us 
 Oh, from fraying at the edge 
 All we knew, all we knew 
 Was You, said You'd come again 
 You'd rise up from the dead 
 It is well, it is done 
 All we have, all we had 
 Is a promise like a thread 
 Holding us, keeping us 
 Oh, from fraying at the edge 
 All we know, all we know 
 Is You, said You'd come again 
 You rose up from the dead 
 All we have, all we had 
 Is a promise like a thread 
 Holding us, keeping us 
 Oh, from fraying at the edge 
 All we know, all we know 
 Is You, said You'd come again 
 You rose up from the dead 
 You rose up from the dead

I could just sit 
 I could just sit 
 And wait for all Your goodness 
 Hope to feel Your presence 
 And I could just stay 
 I could just stay right where I am 
 And hope to feel You 
 Hope to feel something again 
 And I could hold on 
 I could hold on to who I am 
 And never let You change me 
 From the inside 
 And I could be safe 
 I could be safe here in Your arms 
 And never leave home 
 Never let these walls down 
 But You have called me higher 
 You have called me deeper 
 And I will go where You will lead me, Lord 
 You have called me higher 
 You have called me deeper 
 And I will go where You lead me, Lord 
 Where You lead me 
 Where You lead me, Lord 
 And I will be Yours 
 I will be Yours for all my life 
 So let Your mercy 
 Light the path before me

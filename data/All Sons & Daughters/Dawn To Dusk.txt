Lord as we turn to You 
 Come free us from our sin 
 We only have to 
 So let us now begin 
 From dawn to dusk 
 We are waking up 
 From dawn to dusk 
 We are waking up 
 Tomorrow's freedom is today's surrender 
 We come before You lay our burdens down 
 We look to You as our hearts remember 
 You are the only God 
 You are our only God 
 Lord as we give You more 
 Your Spirit swells within 
 'Cause You are holy holy Lord 
 So let us now begin 
 From dawn to dusk 
 We are waking up 
 From dawn to dusk 
 We are waking up 
 Tomorrow's freedom is today's surrender 
 We come before You lay our burdens down 
 We look to You as our hearts remember 
 You are the only God 
 You are our only God 
 Ooh yeah ooh oh ooh ooh ooh 
 Tomorrow's freedom is today's surrender 
 We come before You lay our burdens down 
 We look to You as our hearts remember 
 You are the only God 
 You are our only God 
 Tomorrow's freedom is today's surrender 
 We come before You lay our burdens down 
 We look to You as our hearts remember 
 You are the only God 
 You are our only God

I bring my every need 
 Confessing everything 
 Lord, I'm desperate 
 For Your healing 
 I'm broke in every part 
 My unbelieving heart 
 I need the faith 
 To even ask You 
 So I'm not bargaining 
 For nothing's hidden 
 From Your sight 
 I would be a fool 
 If I could be made new 
 Come ruin, come ridicule 
 Recklessly I come 
 I run to You 
 I come expectantly 
 Because You're calling me 
 There is no healing 
 But from Your hand 
 So whether suffering 
 Or free from laboring 
 It's for Your glory and my good 
 I would be a fool 
 If I could be made new 
 Come ruin, come ridicule 
 Recklessly I come 
 I run to You 
 I run to You 
 I would be a fool 
 If I could be made new 
 Come ruin, come ridicule 
 I would be a fool 
 If I could be made new 
 Come ruin, come ridicule 
 Recklessly I come 
 I run to You 
 Recklessly I come 
 I run to You 
 So whether suffering 
 Or free from laboring 
 It's for Your glory and my good

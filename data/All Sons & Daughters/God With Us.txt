You've come 
 To bring peace 
 To be love 
 To be nearer to us 
 You've come 
 To bring life 
 To be light 
 To shine brighter in us 
 Oh Emmanuel 
 God with us 
 Our Deliverer 
 You are Savior 
 In Your presence we find our strength 
 Over everything 
 Our redemption 
 God with us 
 You are God with us 
 You've come 
 To be hope 
 To this world 
 For Your honor and name 
 You've come 
 To take sin 
 To bear shame 
 And to conquer the grave 
 You are here and 
 You are holy 
 We are standing 
 In Your glory (Lord)

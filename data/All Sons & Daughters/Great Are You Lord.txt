You give life, You are love 
 You bring light to the darkness 
 You give hope, You restore 
 Every heart that is broken 
 Great are You, Lord 
 It's Your breath in our lungs 
 So we pour out our praise 
 We pour out our praise 
 It's Your breath in our lungs 
 So we pour out our praise to You only 
 You give life, You are love 
 You bring light to the darkness 
 You give hope, You restore 
 Every heart that is broken 
 Great are You, Lord 
 All the earth will shout Your praise 
 Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing 
 Great are You, Lord

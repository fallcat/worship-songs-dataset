God of mercy, full of grace 
 You are forever, always forever 
 Slow to anger, rich in love 
 You are forever, always forever 
 We hear Your kingdom shout 
 And all Your praises reign 
 So let the heavens roar 
 Echo across the ground 
 And as Your people 
 Sing of Your majesty 
 Lord, hear the sound 
 Lord, hear the sound 
 Everyone, everyone 
 Everyone, everyone 
 Everyone 
 You forgive, You forgive everyone 
 You restore, You restore everyone 
 You redeem, You redeem everyone

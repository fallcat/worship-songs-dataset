Oh light appeared from nothing 
 Oh light appeared from nothing 
 With The Spirit brooding over water 
 Heaven meets earth 
 From night then came the morning 
 From night then came the morning 
 There was sky in the middle of the water 
 Heaven meets earth 
 The sun revealed Your beauty 
 The sun revealed Your beauty 
 Every mountain bowing down before You 
 Heaven meets earth 
 Creation sings Your glory 
 Creation sings Your glory 
 Hallelujah's rising like the daylight 
 And heaven meets earth 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 Early in the morning 
 Our song shall rise to thee 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Merciful and mighty 
 God in three persons 
 Blessed Trinity

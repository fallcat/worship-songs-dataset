You broke my chains of sin and shame 
 And You covered me with grace 
 And You mend my life with Your holy fire 
 You cover me with grace 
 And You are the hand that reaches out to save 
 And I am set free, oh oh oh 
 I am set free, oh oh oh 
 It is for freedom that I am set free 
 You broke my chains of sin and shame 
 And You covered me with grace 
 And You mend my life with Your holy fire 
 You cover me with grace 
 And You are the hand that reaches out to save 
 And I am set free, oh oh oh 
 I am set free, oh oh oh 
 It is for freedom that I am set free 
 And yes Lord 
 We are grateful 
 For Your grace 
 And for Your love 
 Yes Lord 
 We are grateful 
 For Your grace 
 And for Your love 
 'Cause You are the hand that reaches out to save 
 I am set free, oh oh oh 
 I am set free, oh oh oh 
 It is for freedom that I am set free 
 And I am set free, oh oh oh 
 I am set free, oh oh oh 
 It is for freedom that I am set free

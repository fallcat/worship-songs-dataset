The riches of this world will fade 
 The treasures of our God remain 
 Here I empty myself to owe this world 
 Nothing and find everything in You 
 I surrender, I surrender 
 I surrender all to You 
 Take my life, a sacrifice 
 In You alone I'm satisfied 
 Here I empty myself to owe this world 
 Nothing and find everything in You 
 Everything in You 
 I surrender, I surrender 
 I surrender all to You 
 Not my will, but Yours be done 
 Not my strength, but Yours alone 
 Nothing else, but You oh Lord 
 I find everything in You 
 I surrender, I surrender 
 I surrender all to You

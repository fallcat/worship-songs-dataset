Oh restless heart, do not grow weary 
 Hold on to faith and wait 
 The God of love, He will not tarry 
 He is never late 
 So I wait in the promise 
 I wait in hope 
 Yes, I wait in the power 
 Of God's unending love 
 Be still and rest secure, my soul 
 He knows what's best for me 
 Here in my patience lies the goal 
 To wait and trust in Thee 
 So I wait in the promise 
 I wait in hope 
 Yes, I wait in the power 
 Of God's unending love 
 Even through my imperfections 
 His light is shining through 
 Though dim I am still a reflection 
 Of mercy and the truth 
 So I wait in the promise 
 I wait in hope 
 Yes, I wait in the power 
 Of God's unending love 
 So I wait in the promise 
 Oh, I wait in hope 
 Yes, I wait in the power 
 Of God's unending love 
 Of God's unending love 
 Of God's unending love

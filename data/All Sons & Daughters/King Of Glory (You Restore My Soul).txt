I know a place where I can find You 
 Here in the valley of the shadows 
 Give me eyes to see 
 Where You're leading me 
 I know a place where I can feel You 
 Here in the freedom of forgiveness 
 Give me strength to hold 
 Fast to what I know 
 You restore my soul 
 I'm Yours alone 
 Oh King of glory 
 When dark gives way to light 
 Your hope will rise 
 Oh King of glory 
 I know a place where I can hear You 
 Your truth is a whisper in the chaos 
 Give me faith to stand 
 Strong in this rushing wind 
 You restore my soul 
 I'm Yours alone 
 Oh King of glory 
 When dark gives way to light 
 Your hope will rise 
 Oh King of glory 
 Surely goodness 
 And mercy 
 Follow me 
 Every moment 
 I will dwell with You 
 You restore my soul 
 I'm Yours alone 
 Oh King of glory 
 When dark gives way to light 
 Your hope will rise 
 Oh King of glory

There are a million truths for every lie 
 So speak it out loud and let it lift high 
 There are a million reasons to cover your eyes 
 But the light is shining through the darkness we hide 
 But the light is shining through the darkness we hide 
 So come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it shine 
 Come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it shine 
 There's only one way to wash yourself clean 
 So let the dirt fall and get on your knees 
 There are a million scars for every mistake 
 Oh, but we are not chained to the secrets that we've made 
 Oh, but we are not chained to the secrets that we've made 
 So come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it shine 
 Come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it shine 
 This is the battle of our time, of our time now 
 We can't afford not to cry, not to cry out 
 Shake the earth from the ground, from the ground 
 Rescue souls from the darkness around 
 So come let it 
 So come let it 
 Come let it 
 Come let it shine 
 So come let it 
 Come let it 
 So come let it 
 So come let it shine 
 This is the battle of our time, of our time now 
 We can't afford not to cry, not to cry out 
 Shake the earth from the ground, from the ground 
 Rescue souls from the darkness around

What can compare 
 To the love of Jesus 
 Who can repair 
 Every broken thing 
 No other One 
 Can break this darkness 
 No other name 
 No other name 
 And I need You 
 More than anything 
 What can compare 
 To the love of Jesus 
 Who can repair 
 Every broken thing 
 No other One 
 Can break this darkness 
 No other name 
 No other name 
 I need You 
 More than anything 
 Jesus, I need You 
 More than anything 
 Through the calm and the storm 
 In the chaos 
 Though the mountains will crumble 
 You will not 
 Never failing Your promise eternal 
 I need You 
 More than anything 
 I need You 
 More than anything 
 I need You 
 More than anything 
 Jesus, I need You 
 More than anything 
 I need You 
 More than anything

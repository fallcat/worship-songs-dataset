Let worldly minds the world pursue 
 It has no charms for me 
 Once I admired it's trifles, too 
 But grace has set me free 
 It's pleasure now no longer please 
 No more content afford 
 Far from my heart be the joys like these 
 Now I have seen the Lord 
 As by the light of opening day 
 The stars are all concealed 
 So earthly pleasures fade away 
 When Jesus is revealed 
 Creatures no more divide my choice 
 I bid them all depart 
 His name, His love, His gracious voice 
 Have fixed my roving heart 
 Now Lord I will be Thine alone 
 And wholly live to Thee 
 But I may hope that Your will own 
 A worthless soul like me 
 Yes tho of sinners I am the worst 
 I cannot doubt thy will 
 For if Thou had not loved me first 
 I had refused thee still 
 Creatures no more divide my choice 
 I bid them all depart 
 His name, His love, His gracious voice 
 Have fixed my roving heart

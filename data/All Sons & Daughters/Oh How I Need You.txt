Lord, I find You in the seeking 
 Lord, I find You in the doubt 
 And to know You is to love You 
 And to know so little else 
 I need You 
 Oh, how I need You 
 Oh, how I need You 
 Oh, how I need You 
 Lord, I find You in the morning 
 Lord, I seek You everyday 
 Let my life be for Your glory 
 Woven in Your threads of grace 
 Light glorious light 
 I will go where You shine 
 Break the dawn, crack the skies 
 Make the way bright before me 
 In Your light I will find all I need 
 All I need is You

Oh, oh, oh, our Lord! Oh, oh, oh, our Lord! 
 How majestic is Your name in all the Earth 
 We behold the rising sun. 
 The earth awakes, Your hope has come 
 We look to You, we long for You, oh Lord 
 We behold the breaking dawn. 
 The light that shines over everyone 
 We behold the breaking dawn. 
 The light that shines over everyone 
 We look to You, we long for You, oh Lord 
 Oh, oh, oh, our Lord! Oh, oh, oh, our Lord! 
 How majestic is Your name in all the Earth 
 We behold the falling rain, 
 Like waters rise, flood this place 
 We reach for You, we cling to You, oh Lord! 
 Oh, oh, oh, our Lord! Oh, oh, oh, our Lord! 
 How majestic is Your name in all the Earth 
 Oh Your name is a light in the darkness 
 Oh Your name is the word of truth 
 Oh Your name, oh Your name

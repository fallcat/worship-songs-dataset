Along this path of sorrow 
 Along this winding road 
 I find myself traveling 
 Where sorrow is unknown 
 And chaos calls to chaos 
 Below the waterfalls 
 All Your waves crash o'er me 
 I'm crushed beneath it all 
 But I know, I know 
 You remain the same 
 Even in, even in 
 My wandering 
 Sometimes I often wonder 
 If You have let me down 
 Why does it seem I walk alone 
 Where trouble finds me out 
 But sorrow as my company 
 I fix my eyes on You 
 Soon again I'll praise Your name 
 And feel my soul renewed 
 As I know, I know 
 You remain the same 
 Even in, even in 
 My wandering 
 Oh I know, I know 
 You remain the same 
 Even in, even in 
 My wandering 
 A traveler never reaches 
 That sacred place alone 
 A light to always guide you 
 Along the narrow road 
 So steadily I keep my stride 
 Through every briar and thorn 
 Although my flesh will falter 
 My hope is in the Lord 
 Because I know, I know 
 You remain the same 
 Even in, even in 
 My wandering 
 Oh I know, I know 
 You remain the same 
 Even in, even in 
 My wandering 
 Oh I know, I know 
 You remain the same 
 Even in, even in 
 My wandering 
 Because I know, I know 
 You remain the same 
 Even in, even in 
 My wandering

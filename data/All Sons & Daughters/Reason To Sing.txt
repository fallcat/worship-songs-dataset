When the pieces seem too shattered 
 To gather off the floor 
 And all that really matters 
 Is that I can't feel You anymore 
 Is that I don't feel You anymore 
 I need a reason to sing 
 I need a reason to sing 
 I need to know that You're still holding 
 The whole world in Your hands 
 And I need a reason to sing 
 When I'm overcome by fear 
 And I hate everything I know 
 If this waiting lasts forever 
 I'm afraid I might let go 
 I'm afraid I might let go 
 'Cause I need a reason to sing 
 'Cause I need a reason to sing 
 I need to know that You're still holding 
 The whole world in Your hands 
 And I need a reason to sing 
 You gave me a reason 
 Will there be a victory? 
 Will You sing it over me now? 
 Your peace is the melody 
 Will You sing it over me now? 
 'Cause I need a reason to sing 
 I need a reason to sing 
 I need to know that You're still holding 
 The whole world in Your hands 
 And that is a reason to sing

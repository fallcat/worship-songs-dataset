Who is Lord, but our Lord 
 Who is God, only God 
 You are the highest 
 You are most good 
 Matchless is Your love 
 Our praise will rise above 
 Your peace like a river 
 Floods over us 
 Our hearts are restless 
 Until they find rest in You 
 Our hearts are restless 
 Until they find rest in You 
 This is where my hope lies 
 This is where my souls sighs 
 I will always find my rest in You 
 So full of mercy 
 Beauty and mystery 
 You are most hidden 
 But always with us 
 Our hearts are restless 
 Until they find rest in You 
 Our hearts are restless 
 Until they find rest in You 
 This is where my hope lies 
 This is where my souls sighs 
 I will always find my rest in You 
 You cannot change 
 Yet You change everything 
 You cannot change 
 Yet You change everything 
 You cannot change 
 Yet You change everything 
 You cannot change 
 Yet You change everything

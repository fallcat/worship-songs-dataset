Your spirit speaks, it moves in me 
 And I'm awakened to Your love 
 You're drawing me onto my knees 
 And I'm astounded by Your love 
 You spoke life into my lungs 
 You are the air I breathe 
 You are the air I breathe 
 Still You move inside of me 
 You are the song I sing 
 You are the song I sing, Jesus 
 You cover me with arms that reach 
 And I'm amazed by Your sweet grace 
 You set me free, You washed me clean 
 And I'm forgiven by Your grace 
 You spoke life into my lungs 
 You are the air I breathe 
 You are the air I breathe 
 Still You move inside of me 
 You are the song I sing 
 You are the song I sing, Jesus 
 With every breath I breathe 
 With every song I sing 
 I want to shout it out 
 Lord, I am listening 
 To every word You speak 
 I'll go where You will lead 
 To love the least of these 
 My greatest offering

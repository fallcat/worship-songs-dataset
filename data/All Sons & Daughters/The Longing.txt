These things unseen won't cripple me 
 I place my hope in You 
 This deep desire, this longing of 
 I'm falling into You 
 Love is and always was 
 The longing place inside my heart 
 To know You 
 And be known by You 
 This place this time won't satisfy 
 My soul was made for You 
 My eyes behold what's beautiful 
 And I belong to You 
 Love is and always was 
 The longing place inside my heart 
 To know You 
 And be known by You 
 How I long, how I long 
 How I long for You

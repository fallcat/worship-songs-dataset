In the final breath 
 Of love's great death 
 A cry that shattered the veil 
 And darkness ran as light floods in 
 Washing over this land 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Yours is the victory, Lord 
 In the Kingdom of eternal love 
 Injustice will not prevail 
 And hopes arise 
 With Heaven in sight 
 And as Your people we sing 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Yours is the victory, Lord 
 So we shout for joy to the Lord 
 And all the earth will adore You 
 Let the oceans roar 
 Mountains bow before You 
 Now we lift up our praise 
 To God whose marvelous name 
 Is high above it all 
 The victory is Yours, Lord 
 In these holy days 
 We celebrate 
 Our God, Your people are here 
 No depth or height 
 No grave or life 
 No nothing will separate us 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Yours is the victory, Lord 
 The victory, Lord 
 So we shout for joy to the Lord 
 And all the earth will adore You 
 Let the oceans roar 
 Mountains bow before You 
 Now we lift up our praise 
 To God whose marvelous name 
 Is high above it all 
 The victory is Yours, Lord 
 Nations tremble, enemies fall 
 Our God and King has won the war 
 So raise the banner, lift it high 
 He reigns forever 
 So we shout for joy to the Lord 
 And all the earth will adore You 
 Let the oceans roar 
 Mountains bow before You 
 Now we lift up our praise 
 To God whose marvelous name 
 Is high above it all 
 The victory is Yours, Lord

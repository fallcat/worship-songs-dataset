This, my inheritance 
 Will never spoil or fade 
 Until he comes, my salvation 
 In heaven kept by faith 
 This, my inheritance 
 God's power will be its shield 
 Through Jesus Christ, the only light 
 By which it is revealed 
 All praise, all praise, all praise be to God 
 Always, always and forever 
 All praise, all praise, all praise be to God 
 Always, always and forever 
 This, my inheritance 
 Through suffering and trial 
 More worth than gold, our only hope 
 In faith our song will rise 
 All praise, all praise, all praise be to God 
 Always, always and forever 
 All praise, all praise, all praise be to God 
 Always, always and forever 
 As it was in the beginning 
 Is now and ever shall be 
 A world without end, Amen 
 As it was in the beginning 
 Is now and ever shall be 
 A world without end, Amen 
 This my inheritance 
 That none can take away 
 Not even death, with my last breath 
 I'll see my Savior's face 
 All praise, all praise, all praise be to God 
 Always, always and forever 
 All praise, all praise, all praise be to God 
 Always, always and forever 
 All praise, all praise, all praise be to God 
 Always, always and forever

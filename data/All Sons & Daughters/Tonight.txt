Jesus Christ, will You guide me 
 Through this life? 
 Wake me with each morning's light 
 Oh and keep my soul 
 Through Your strength 
 All my fears will fade away 
 As You lead me in Your ways 
 I will trust in You 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest in Your arms tonight 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest, I will rest 
 Tonight 
 All I see 
 Is Your beauty chasing me 
 Oh the love that sets me free 
 I am found in You 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest in Your arms tonight 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest, I will rest 
 Tonight, oh oh 
 Tonight, oh oh 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest in Your arms tonight 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest, I will rest 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest in Your arms tonight 
 Your love is deep 
 Your love is wide 
 I will rest, I will rest 
 Tonight, oh oh 
 Tonight, oh oh 
 Lay Your peace 
 Like a blanket over me 
 And as I lay down to sleep 
 I will rest in You

We have seen the pain 
 That shaped our hearts 
 And in our shame 
 We're still breathing, 'cause 
 We have seen the hope 
 Of Your healing 
 Rising from our souls 
 Is the feeling 
 We are drawing close 
 Your light is shining through 
 So wake up, wake up 
 Wake up all you sleepers 
 Stand up, stand up 
 Stand up all you dreamers 
 Hands up, hands up 
 Hands up all believers 
 Take up your cross, carry it on 
 All that You reveal 
 With light in us 
 Will come to life 
 And start breathing, 'cause 
 We have seen the hope 
 Of Your healing 
 Rising from our souls 
 Is the feeling 
 We are drawing close 
 Your light is shining through 
 So wake up, wake up 
 Wake up all you sleepers 
 Stand up, oh stand up 
 Stand up all you dreamers 
 Hands up, oh hands up 
 Hands up all believers 
 Take up your cross, carry it on 
 Here we stand, our hearts are Yours 
 Not our will but Yours be done 
 Here we stand, our hearts are Yours 
 Not our will but Yours be done 
 Here we stand, our hearts are Yours 
 Not our will but Yours be done 
 Here we stand, our hearts are Yours 
 Not our will but Yours be done 
 So wake up, wake up, wake up 
 Wake up all you sleepers 
 Stand up, oh stand up 
 Stand up all you dreamers 
 Hands up, oh hands up 
 Hands up all believers 
 Take up your cross, carry it on 
 So wake up, wake up, wake up 
 Wake up all you sleepers 
 Stand up, oh stand up 
 Stand up all you dreamers 
 Hands up, oh hands up 
 Hands up all believers 
 Take up your cross, carry it on 
 Here we stand, our hearts are Yours 
 Not our will but Yours be done 
 Here we stand, our hearts are Yours 
 Not our will but Yours be done 
 Here we stand, our hearts are Yours 
 Not our will but Yours be done

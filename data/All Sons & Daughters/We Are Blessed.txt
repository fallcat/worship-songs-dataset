We are loved at the end of our rope 
 When we're less there is more of the Lord 
 In the fight for our souls we must learn to let go 
 And abandon who we are 
 We are loved when we feel all is lost 
 When the shadows are cast on the cross 
 Only then can we know the embrace of the one 
 Who's carried us along 
 We are blessed, we are blessed 
 We are blessed, we are blessed 
 We are loved when we feel most content 
 With who we are, nothing more nothing less 
 We'll inherit the earth declaring Your worth 
 Bring glory to Your name 
 We are blessed, we are blessed 
 We are blessed, we are blessed 
 We are blessed, we are blessed 
 We are blessed, we are blessed 
 We're blessed, we're loved 
 Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice 
 We're blessed, we're loved 
 Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice 
 We're blessed, we're loved 
 Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice 
 We're blessed, we're loved 
 Our hearts, our souls, we now rejoice, rejoice 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh

God and Father, great and holy 
 Fearing not, we come to Thee 
 Fearing not, though weak lowly 
 For Your love has set us free 
 And by the blue sky bending over 
 By the green earth's flowery home 
 Teach us Lord the angel chorus 
 You are love and love alone! 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are 
 Though the worlds in flame should perish 
 Sun and stars in ruin fall 
 Trust in Thee our hearts should cherish 
 Oh Lord be our all in all 
 With Your name the heavens praising 
 Angels hymn no sweeter tone 
 Than the songs our hearts are raising 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are 
 How perfectly 
 Our hearts are made for love 
 How perfectly 
 Our hearts are made for love 
 How perfectly 
 Our hearts are made for love 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are love and love alone 
 You are 
 Oh oh, oh oh 
 Oh, You are 
 You are, You are

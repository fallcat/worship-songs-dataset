It feels like an ocean of sorrow is under my skin 
 Even the ocean eventually meets with the sand 
 Sorrow on sorrow, I'm waiting 
 Heavy I'm anticipating 
 Trusting the current, will carry me 
 You are my strength 
 You are my song 
 You are my salvation 
 You hold it all together 
 You hold it all together 
 We come with great expectations, and fears in our hearts 
 Send us Your light, as we're making our way through the dark 
 All of the earlier troubles 
 Chaos and pain they unravel 
 Looking ahead we rejoice in You 
 You are my strength 
 You are my song 
 You are my salvation 
 You hold it all together 
 You hold it all together 
 Like a stone, in the wasteland 
 I was useless, until You 
 Lifted high, in Your mercy 
 Out of sorrow and made new 
 Oh this mind, it can't measure 
 All Your favors in this world 
 So we shout in adoration 
 Holy, holy are You Lord 
 You are my strength 
 You are my song 
 You are my salvation 
 You hold it all together 
 You hold it all together 
 You hold it all together

You, Oh Lord are my stay 
 Humbly came 
 My soul to save 
 To light the way, oh 
 All I have is found in You 
 Christ in me, all things true 
 All things pure 
 All things good 
 You are the Great I Am 
 So unchanging 
 Your promise is sure 
 Never ending 
 Your love will endure 
 You were, You will be 
 You always are the Great I Am 
 You, Oh Lord will remain 
 When everything else 
 Fades away 
 You, Oh Lord will remain 
 So unchanging 
 Your promise is sure 
 Never ending 
 Your love will endure 
 You were, You will be 
 You always are the Great I Am 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Your love never fails 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Your love never fails 
 So unchanging 
 Your promise is sure 
 Never ending 
 Your love will endure 
 You were, You will be 
 You always are the Great I Am 
 So unchanging 
 Your promise is sure 
 Never ending 
 Your love will endure 
 You were, You will be 
 You always are the Great I Am 
 Oh, the Great I Am 
 Oh, the Great I Am

My life is Yours 
 My hope is in You only 
 And my heart You hold 
 'Cause You made this sinner holy 
 Holy, holy 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 I fall onto my knees in awe 
 And the heartbeat of my life 
 Is to worship in Your light 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 And my life is Yours 
 And my hope is in You only 
 And my heart You hold 
 'Cause You made this sinner holy 
 Holy, holy 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 I fall onto my knees in awe 
 And the heartbeat of my life 
 Is to worship in Your light 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 Glory glory, hallelujah 
 Jesus You are good 
 Glory glory, hallelujah 
 Jesus You are good 
 Glory glory, hallelujah 
 Jesus You are good 
 We sing glory, glory, hallelujah 
 Jesus You are good 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 I fall onto my knees in awe 
 And the heartbeat of my life 
 Is to worship in Your light 
 'Cause Your glory is so beautiful 
 Your glory is so beautiful

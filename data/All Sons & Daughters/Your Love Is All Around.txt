Majesty enthroned in beauty 
 All my life, Your love pursues me and I'm found in You 
 Oh, Holy One, the King of glory 
 You're the Author of my story and I'm found in You 
 'Cause You give me life, it leads me to find 
 Your grace and Your mercy given so freely 
 Your word is my light, it leads me to find 
 Your comfort and healing, the hope that I'm needing 
 Your love is all around 
 Your love is all around 
 Oh, Living One, You reign forever 
 Drawing me into Your presence and I'm found in You 
 Oh Great Redeemer, Precious Savior 
 You are faithful, though I wander and I'm found in You 
 'Cause You give me life, it leads me to find 
 Your grace and Your mercy given so freely 
 Your word is my light, it leads me to find 
 Your comfort and healing, the hope that I'm needing 
 Your love is all around, oh, oh 
 Your love is all around, oh, oh 
 And I hear Your voice, I hear the words You've spoken 
 This love is Yours, this love restores the broken 
 And I hear Your voice, I hear the words You've spoken 
 This love is Yours, this love restores the broken 
 Oh, oh, Your love is all around 
 Oh, oh, Your love is all around 
 Oh, oh, Your love is all around, oh, oh 
 And this is all my hope and peace, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 And this is all my righteousness, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 And oh, precious is the flow that makes me white as snow 
 No other fount I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Oh, oh, Your love is all around 
 Oh, oh, Your love is all around 
 Oh, oh, Your love is all around, oh, oh

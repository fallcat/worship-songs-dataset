Once we were a barren land 
 Dry from disappointment 
 But Heaven like a heavy rain 
 Revealed Your heart for us 
 Now we're dusting off our instruments 
 In You we found our will to live 
 What was once a wilderness 
 Is teeming with new life 
 Cause You are mending the brokenhearted 
 You are making all things new 
 You're rebuilding out of the ruins 
 A city of hope, with the ones You love 
 Adoption is our heritage 
 Chosen from the orphanage 
 The Father's great inheritance 
 Bestowed upon us all 
 And we're the ones You love

Your love has ravished my heart, and 
 Taken me over, taken me over 
 And all I want is to be 
 With You forever, with You forever 
 So pull me a little closer 
 Take me a little deeper 
 I want to know Your heart 
 I want to know Your heart 
 'Cause Your love is so much sweeter 
 Than anything I've tasted 
 I want to know Your heart 
 I want to know Your heart 
 Whoa, whoa, how great Your love is for me 
 Whoa, whoa, how great is Your love 
 I could never run from Your love 
 I could never hide from Your love 
 I could never run from Your love 
 Further than You'll find me 
 So pull me a little closer 
 Take me a little deeper 
 I want to know Your heart 
 'Cause Your love is so much stronger 
 Than anything I've faced and 
 I want to know Your heart 
 I want to know Your heart

Let the heroes rest 
 Let the striving cease 
 I lay down my crown 
 Here at your feet 
 I will, trust, here in the mystery 
 I will, trust, in You completely 
 Awake my soul to sing 
 With Your breath in me 
 I will worship 
 You taught my feet to dance upon disappointment 
 And I, I will worship 
 Let the weary rise 
 Lift their eyes to see 
 Your love crushing every lie 
 Every doubt and fear 
 I will, trust, here in the mystery 
 I will, trust, in You completely 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, You are making all things new 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, You are making all things new 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, You are making all things new 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, You are making all things new

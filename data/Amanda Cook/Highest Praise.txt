To the One who's seated on the throne above all thrones 
 To the One who saw fit to gather all His children close 
 To the One I feel in the sunlight on my skin 
 To the One who shattered every remnant of my sin 
 To the One who was, the One who is, and is to come 
 To the One who was, the One who is, and is to come 
 Highest Praises 
 Highest Praises 
 Every ear will hear the story of Your furious love 
 Every eye will see the glory of the coming King 
 Every knee will bow, every tongue confess Your Name 
 And with the crowd I will lift my voice, I will lift my voice to sing 
 Hallelujah, we join with all of Heaven 
 Hallelujah, we join with all of Heaven 
 Singing Hallelujah, we join with all of Heaven 
 Singing Hallelujah, we join with all of Heaven

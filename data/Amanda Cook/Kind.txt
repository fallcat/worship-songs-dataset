You are not a tyrant King 
 You do not delight in suffering 
 Your power doesn't compensate for insecurity 
 'Cause You are not a tyrant King 
 You are not an angry man 
 You do not treat us with contempt 
 Your voice is sure, Your eyes are soft, Your smile, confident 
 'Cause You are not an angry man 
 You are kind 
 You are kind 
 You are kind 
 You are kind 
 Your love is a fury all its own 
 Sweeping the dust and turning feet towards home 
 Carrying the orphans and resetting broken bones 
 Your love is a fury all its own 
 And love is powerful enough 
 Without the fear of punishment

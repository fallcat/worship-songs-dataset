Beyond the end and the beginning 
 You have been and You will be 
 Who in all the world is like You 
 Still I'm not beyond your reach 
 You are, faultless in Your very nature 
 Yet you understand the human mind 
 Faithful even when I wander 
 You are patient, You are kind 
 How deep 
 How wide 
 How high is Your love for me 
 I can never see the end 
 Where can I go from Your Presence 
 Your love surrounds me on all sides 
 Free from shame there is no hiding 
 I am Yours and You are mine

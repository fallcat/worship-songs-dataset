Unreserved, unrestrained 
 Your love is wild, Your love is wild for me 
 It isn't shy, it's unashamed 
 Your love is proud to be seen with me 
 You don't give Your heart in pieces 
 You don't hide Yourself to tease us 
 Uncontrolled, un-contained 
 Your love is a fire burning bright for me 
 It's not just a spark, it's not just a flame 
 Your love is a light, and all the world will see 
 You don't give Your heart in pieces 
 You don't hide Yourself to tease us 
 You don't give Your heart in pieces 
 You don't hide Yourself to tease us 
 Your love's not fractured 
 It's not a troubled mind 
 It isn't anxious, it's not the restless kind 
 Your love's not passive 
 It's never disengaged 
 It's always present 
 It hangs on every word we say 
 Love keeps its promises, it keeps its word 
 It honors what's sacred, cause its vows are good 
 Your love's not broken 
 It's not insecure 
 Your love's not selfish, Your love is pure

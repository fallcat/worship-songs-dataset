In the process, in the waiting 
 You're making melodies over me 
 And Your presence is the promise 
 For I am a pilgrim on a journey 
 You will lift my head above the mighty waves 
 You are able to keep me from stumbling 
 And in my weakness 
 You are the strength that comes from within 
 Good Shepherd of my soul 
 Take my hand and lead me on 
 You make my footsteps and my path secure 
 So walking on water is just the beginning 
 Cause my faith to arise, stand at attention 
 For You are calling me to greater things 
 Oh how I love You, how I love You 
 You have not forsaken me 
 Oh how I love You, how I love You 
 With You is where I want to be

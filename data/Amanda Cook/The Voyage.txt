Speak, even if your voice is trembling 
 Please, you've been quiet for so long 
 Believe, it'll be worth the risk you're taking 
 You're afraid, but you can hear adventure calling 
 There's a rush of adrenaline to your bones 
 What you make of this moment changes everything 
 What if the path you choose becomes a road 
 The ground you take becomes a home 
 The wind is high, but the pressure's off 
 I'll send the rain wherever we end up, wherever we end up 
 Set your sights, sailing far beyond familiar 
 In the rising tide, you'll find the rhythm of your heart 
 And lift your head, now the wind and waves don't matter 
 I am the wind in your sails 
 I am the wind in your sails 
 I am the wind in your sails

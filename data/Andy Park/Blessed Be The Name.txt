I am standing beneath your wings 
 I am resting in your shelter 
 Your great faithfulness has been my shield 
 And it makes me want to sing 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 I will bless your holy name for all my days 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 I sing praises to your name Oh Lord 
 For you daily bear my burdens 
 Your great faithfulness is my reward 
 And it makes me want to sing 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord

Like a wounded lamb I come 
 Lord I cannot walk alone 
 I come to fall into your arms 
 I am weak and I am weary 
 Lord there's far too much to carry 
 I come to fall into your arms 
 Father carry me 
 Through the pain I must endure 
 Carry me through the darkness 
 Carry me for your arms are strong and sure 
 My Father I need you to carry me 
 In the dark night of my soul 
 When I cannot carry on 
 I come to fall into your arms 
 I will cast my cares on you 
 For I know you care for me 
 I come to fall into your arms 
 Comfort me, Comfort me 
 My Father I need you to comfort me 
 Carry me, Carry me 
 My Father I need you to carry me

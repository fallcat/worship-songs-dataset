When Your children cried in pain, 
 "Deliver us from Pharaoh's hand," 
 Your kingdom came 
 You released them from their chains 
 And You led them to the Promised Land, 
 Your kingdom came 
 You rolled back the mighty waters 
 And You crushed their enemy 
 You brought freedom to the prisoners 
 And You gave them victory 
 You (come) reign over heaven and earth, 
 You (come) reign with all authority 
 You (come) reign over powers and thrones 
 And over all that You have made 
 You (come) reign 
 When the blind man cried to You, 
 "Jesus, touch my eyes so I can see," 
 Your kingdom came 
 When the leper cried to You, 
 "Jesus, I know You can make me clean," 
 Your kingdom came 
 When You heard their cry for mercy, 
 You reached out Your healing hand 
 With compassion and with authority, 
 Lord, bring Your kingdom once again 
 You (come) reign over heaven and earth, 
 You (come) reign with all authority 
 You (come) reign over powers and thrones 
 And over all that You have made 
 You (come) reign 
 ..(Come reign) 
 As we come to worship You 
 In the splendor of Your majesty, 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 As we yield our lives to You, 
 You come to meet our deepest needs, 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 Father, hear our cry for mercy 
 And reach out Your healing hand 
 As we bow to your authority, 
 Bring Your kingdom once again 
 You (come) reign over heaven and earth, 
 You (come) reign with all authority 
 You (come) reign over powers and thrones 
 And over all that You have made 
 You (come) reign 
 ... (Come reign) 
 Come reign over darkness and death, 
 Come reign over Your enemy 
 Come reign over all we can see, 
 And over all that is unseen 
 You (come) reign over heaven and earth, 
 You (come) reign with all authority 
 You (come) reign over powers and thrones 
 And over all that You have made 
 You (come) reign

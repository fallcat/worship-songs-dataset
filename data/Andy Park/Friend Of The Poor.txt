On the African plains a young mother weeps for her hungry child 
 She prays he'll survive 
 With tear-filled eyes she looks up to heaven and calls Your name 
 She pours out her pain 
 You know her name and You hear her cries 
 Friend of the poor help me through the night 
 Help me in the fight, come to my rescue 
 Friend of the poor take these skin and bones 
 Make this heart a home, come to my rescue 
 Friend of the poor 
 On the streets of LA an old man lies in his cardboard home 
 He feels so alone 
 With tear stained eyes he looks up to heaven and prays a prayer 
 Is anyone there? 
 You know his name and You hear his cries 
 Friend of the poor help me through the night 
 Help me in the fight, come to my rescue 
 Friend of the poor take these skin and bones 
 Make this heart a home, come to my rescue 
 It's getting dark, it's getting late 
 It's cold outside the rich man's gate 
 And I'm wondering do you have any friends around here? 
 Who are friends of the poor to help me through the night 
 Help me in the fight, come to my rescue 
 Friend of the poor take these skin and bones 
 Give this heart a home, come to my rescue 
 Friend of the poor help me through the night 
 Help me in the fight 
 Friend of the poor help me through the night 
 Help me in the fight, come to my rescue 
 Friend of the poor take these skin and bones 
 Give this heart a home, come to my rescue 
 Friend of the poor

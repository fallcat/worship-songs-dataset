Jesus before you all secrets are known 
 Before you all thoughts are exposed 
 And nothing is hidden from you 
 And nothing is hidden from you 
 Jesus before you my heart is laid bare 
 And you know my every desire 
 You see me and you know my heart 
 You see me and you know my heart 
 Have your way in me my God 
 Have your way in me my Savior 
 I want my life to be 
 Pleasing unto you 
 Jesus create a pure heart in me 
 Renew a right spirit in me 
 Lord wash me and I will be clean 
 Lord wash me and I will be clean

I see the Lord and His train fills the temple 
 I see the Lord He is high and lifted up 
 I see the Lord and His train fills the temple 
 I see the Lord He is high and lifted up 
 Angels cry holy, holy is the Lord 
 Angels cry holy, holy is the Lord. 
 I see the Lord and His eyes are flaming like fire. 
 I see the Lord and His hair is white as snow. 
 Angels cry holy, holy is the Lord 
 Angels cry holy, holy is the Lord. 
 The angel came and touched the coal to my lips 
 My guilt is gone and my sin has been forgiven 
 And I cry holy, holy is the Lord 
 And I cry holy, holy is the Lord 
 And the temple is filled with the glory of God 
 And the whole earth is filled with the glory of God 
 He calls to me "Whom shall I send?" 
 And I answer Him "I will go for You" 
 And I cry holy, holy is the Lord 
 And I cry holy, holy is the Lord

Multiply Your love through us 
 To the lost and the least 
 Let us be Your healing hands 
 Your instruments of peace 
 May our single purpose be 
 To imitate Your life 
 Through our simple words and deeds 
 Let love be multiplied 
 Multiply Your love through me 
 To someone in need 
 Help me Lord to freely give 
 This grace that I've received 
 Let my single purpose be 
 To imitate Your life 
 Through my simple words and deeds 
 Let love be multiplied 
 Let us see Your kingdom come 
 To the poor and broken ones 
 Let us see a mighty flood 
 Of justice and mercy, O Jesus 
 Let love be multiplied 
 Let love be multiplied 
 Multiply Your church through us 
 To the ends of the Earth 
 Where there's only barrenness 
 Let us see new birth 
 Use us as Your laborers 
 Working side by side 
 Let us see your harvest come 
 Let love be multiplied 
 Multiply Your love through us 
 Multiply Your love (repeat)

Father God, merciful King 
 You have lavished you grace on me 
 With open arms you welcome me in 
 You have called me your child, your friend 
 And you say it's your pleasure to give me your kingdom 
 To pour out your Spirit on me 
 My Father, my friend 
 You have proven you love again and again 
 My Father, my friend 
 You have opened your arms, invited me in 
 I receive your love again 
 Gracious God, help me to see 
 You're not angry, you're patient with me 
 When I fail you always forgive, and you love me just as I am 
 And you say it's your pleasure to give me your kingdom 
 To pour out your Spirit on me 
 I bow at your footstoll in reverence 
 For you are my God and my King 
 You call me to come to your table 
 To speak to you face to face

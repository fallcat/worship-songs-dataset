No one but You Lord 
 Can satisfy this longing in my heart 
 Nothing I do Lord 
 Can take the place of drawing near to You 
 Only You can fill my deepest longing 
 Only You can breathe in me new life 
 Only You can fill my heart with laughter 
 Only You can answer my heart's cry 
 Father I love You 
 Come satisfy the longing in my heart 
 Fill me, overwhelm me 
 Until I know Your love deep in my heart

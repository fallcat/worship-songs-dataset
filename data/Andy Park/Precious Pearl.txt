You are the shining precious pearl 
 There is nothing on earth so perfect and so pure 
 Your beauty now revealed 
 All the things of this world are fading from my view 
 I'd give anything to know you even more 
 I'd go anywhere to follow you my Lord 
 Jesus you are my precious pearl 
 You are beautiful 
 Jesus your are my great reward 
 Lord I live for you 
 Lord you are my precious pearl 
 You are the bright and morning star 
 And you majesty shines through all the universe 
 The treasure of my heart 
 There is nothing on earth that I want more than you 
 I'd give anything to see you even more 
 I'd go anywhere ti follow you my Lord 
 I live because I've seen the power of your lover 
 A foretaste of heaven pure joy forevermore

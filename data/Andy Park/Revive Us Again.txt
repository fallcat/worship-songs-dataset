Awaken our hearts, Lord Jesus, fill us again with Your fire 
 Stir up our zeal for You, Lord, we need another revival 
 Give us a hunger to know You, a passion to seek Your face 
 Pour out a spirit of worship on Your church again 
 Revive us again, revive us again 
 Come renew Your works of power, let Your kingdom come 
 Revive us again, revive us again 
 Come and rule our hearts, Lord Jesus, bring Your reign 
 Revive us again 
 Give us one heart, one vision, to finish the work You've begun 
 Move us with Your compassion to reach out in mercy and love 
 Raise up Your church as an army, Your passionate holy bride 
 That with pure, undivided devotion we would lay down our lives

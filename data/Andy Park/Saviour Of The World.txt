Our gracious God so loved the world 
 He sent his Son to give us life 
 It was his will that none should perish 
 So he sent his Son to die 
 When Jesus died upon that tree 
 The Wrath of God fell upon him 
 He drank the cup of agony 
 To pay the price for our forgiveness 
 Lord Jesus Christ 
 You are the Saviour of the world 
 We worship you, yes we do 
 We worship you, Lamb of God 
 We worship you, Saviour of the world 
 We worship you 
 This was the Father's great salvation 
 Not to condemn but to give life 
 This was his gift to every nation 
 When he sent his Son to die 
 And on that great and glorious day 
 He overcame the power of Satan 
 And when he rose up from the grave 
 He opened wide the gates of heaven

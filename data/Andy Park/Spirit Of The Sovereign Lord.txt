The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon you 
 Because he has anointed you to preach good news 
 He has sent you to the poor (This is the year) 
 To bind up the broken hearted (This is the day) 
 To bring freedom to the captives (This is the year) 
 And to release the ones in darkness 
 (This is the year) of the favour of the Lord 
 (This is the day) of the vengeance of our God 
 (This is the year) of the favour of the Lord 
 (This is the day) of the vengeance of our God 
 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us 
 Because he has anointed us to preach good news 
 He will comfort all who mourn (This is the year) 
 He will provide for those who grieve (This is the day) 
 He will pour out the oil of gladness (This is the year) 
 Instead of mourning you will praise

Down the mountain the river flows 
 And it brings refreshing wherever it goes 
 Through the valleys and over the fields 
 The river is rushing and the river is here 
 The river of God sets our feet a-dancing 
 The river of God fills our hearts with cheer 
 The river of God 
 Fills our mouths with laughter 
 And we rejoice for the river is here 
 The river of God is teeming with life 
 And all who touch it can be revived 
 And those who linger on this river's shore 
 Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord 
 The river of God sets our feet a-dancing 
 The river of God fills our hearts with cheer 
 The river of God 
 Fills our mouths with laughter 
 And we rejoice for the river is here 
 Up to the mountain we love to go 
 To find the presence of the Lord 
 Along the banks of the river we run 
 We dance with laughter 
 Giving praise to the Son 
 The river of God sets our feet a-dancing 
 The river of God fills our hearts with cheer 
 The river of God 
 Fills our mouths with laughter 
 And we rejoice for the river is here 
 Down the mountain the river flows 
 And it brings refreshing wherever it goes 
 Through the valleys and over the fields 
 The river is rushing and the river is here 
 The river of God sets our feet a-dancing 
 The river of God fills our hearts with cheer 
 The river of God 
 Fills our mouths with laughter 
 And we rejoice for the river is here 
 Yes, we rejoice for the river is here

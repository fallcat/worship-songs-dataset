What can I do to serve you? 
 How can I live a life of worship? 
 How can I show you I love you? 
 To freely give your mercy 
 To love the onse who can't repay me 
 This is my worship to you 
 To give my life away 
 To give my life away 
 To follow in your footsteps my Saviour 
 To give my life away 
 What can I do to please you? 
 How can my life reflect your beauty? 
 How can I show you I love you? 
 To befriend the friendless 
 Bringing joy where there is sadness 
 This is my worship to you 
 I choose to carry my cross today 
 I will deny myself and follow you 
 And as I choose to give my life away 
 I will find my life in you 
 To give your love away 
 To give your love away 
 To follow in your footsteps my Saviour 
 To give your love away

You are my light and my salvation 
 Why should I be afraid? 
 When darkness falls, your love surrounds me 
 Why should I be afraid? 
 In the time of trouble I will wait for you 
 When I'm overwhelmed I will call on you 
 You are the rock that can't be moved 
 You are unshakeable 
 You are my strong deliverer 
 You are my rock and I will not be shaken 
 You are my champoin 
 You are a mighty warrior 
 You are my rock and I will not be shaken 
 For you are unshakeable 
 Listen to my cry, O God of mercy 
 Don't hide your face from me 
 You are my strength, You are my stronghold 
 Come speak your words to me 
 In the time of trouble I will wait for you 
 When I'm overwhelmed I will call on you 
 You are the rock that can't be moved 
 You are the same yesterday, today and always

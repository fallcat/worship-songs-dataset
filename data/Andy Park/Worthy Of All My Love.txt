I stand in awe of You 
 For I have seen Your glory 
 I bow before Your throne of majesty 
 I stand amazed at You, so powerful and holy 
 Nothing can compare to You, my King 
 For You are worthy, worthy, 
 Worthy of all my love 
 You're worthy of all that I can give 
 Yes, You are worthy, worthy, 
 Worthy of all I have 
 And I gladly give my life to You 
 All I want to be 
 And all that I desire 
 I surrender now to You, my King 
 For You have let me see a glimpse of Your great glory 
 You deserve my highest loyalty 
 For You are worthy, worthy, 
 Worthy of all my love 
 You're worthy of all that I can give 
 Yes, You are worthy, worthy, 
 Worthy of all I have 
 And I gladly give my life to You 
 I am not my own, I'm bought with a price 
 I belong to You, I'm bought with a price 
 You gave Your blood to purchase my life 
 I would do anything You ask of me, 
 Anything You say 
 You're worthy of all that I can give 
 I would go anywhere You ask me to, 
 Anywhere You say 
 Lord, I gladly give my life to You 
 For You are worthy, worthy, worthy of all my love 
 You're worthy of all that I can give 
 Yes, You are worthy, worthy, worthy of all I have 
 And I gladly give my life to You (x3)

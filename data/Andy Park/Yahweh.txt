Yahweh, Yahweh 
 Ancient One yet you're here today 
 Ageless One, Changeless One 
 Showing love to all generations 
 Show us your glory, oh Lord 
 Let your goodness pass before us 
 Right before our eyes 
 And we will worship, and we will bow down 
 And we will call you Lord 
 And we will kneel before 
 The maker of the universe 
 And we will call you Lord 
 Yahweh, Yahweh 
 Faithful One, you have shown us the way 
 Through the years, through all our lives 
 You have shown you are faithful to the end 
 Yahweh, Yahweh, etc...

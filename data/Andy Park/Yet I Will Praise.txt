I will praise You Lord my God, 
 Even in my brokenness 
 I will praise 
 You Lord 
 I will praise You Lord my God, 
 Even in my desperation 
 I will praise 
 You Lord 
 And I can understand all that 
 You allow I just can see the reason 
 But my life is in Your hands and though 
 I cannot see, I choose to 
 Trust You 
 Even when my heart is torn 
 I will praise (trust) You Lord 
 Even when I feel deserted I will praise You Lord 
 Even in the darkest valley I will praise You Lord 
 When my world is shattered and it seems all hope is gone 
 Yet I will praise You Lord 
 I will trust You Lord my God, 
 Even in my loneliness 
 I will trust 
 You Lord 
 I will trust You Lord my God, 
 Even when I cannot hear you 
 I will trust You Lord 
 And I will not forget that you hung on a cross 
 Lord you bled and 
 Died for me 
 And if I have to suffer 
 I know that you'e been there 
 And I know that you'e here now

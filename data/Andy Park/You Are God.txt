Robed in royal majesty 
 Clothed in holy mystery 
 Lving for eternity 
 You are God 
 High above humanity 
 Sovereign over history 
 Ruling with authority 
 You are God 
 All of earth and heaven will bow down to you 
 And we will sing 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Who reigns forever 
 Your wisdom is unsearchable 
 Your power is unlimited 
 Reigning over all the earth 
 You are God 
 Who could ever understand 
 The moving of your sovereign hand 
 The mystery of all your plans 
 You are God 
 All of earth and heaven will bow down to you 
 And we will sing, we will sing 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Who regins forever 
 Mighty is our King 
 Mighty is our King 
 Mighty is our King 
 Who reigns forever 
 Humbly we bow before you 
 In reverence and adoration

I see You in the simplest things and I feel You in me 
 I know You from the words you speak but I find You on my knees 
 And get caught up in the mystery 
 Still I refuse to miss the forest for the trees 
 So come reveal Your heart for all to see 
 The beauty and the majesty 
 Awake, awake my soul to the Son 
 And sing praises to the holy one 
 His name is Jesus, He has saved us 
 And given us His Spirit for the day 
 We'll sing praises Your name 
 Your breath's becoming life to me 
 And with each breath I am set free 
 Your spirit fills, I breathe you deep 
 And I know You see that Your life brings forth a song to sing 
 The only gift I have to bring 
 And I get swept up in the melody 
 In worship to You my king 
 Sing praises (Hallelujah) to the holy one 
 Sing praises (Hallelujah) to Your name

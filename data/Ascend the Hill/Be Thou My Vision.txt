Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart 
 Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art 
 Thou my best Thought, by day or by night 
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light 
 Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word 
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord 
 Thou my great Father, and I, Thy true son 
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one 
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise 
 Thou mine Inheritance, now and always 
 Thou and Thou only, put first in my heart 
 High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art 
 Oh God, be my everything, be my delight 
 Be Jesus, my glory, my soul's satisfied 
 Oh God, be my everything, be my delight 
 Be Jesus, my glory, my soul's satisfied 
 My Jesus, You satisfy 
 My Jesus, You satisfy 
 My Jesus, You satisfy 
 My Jesus, You satisfy 
 High King of Heaven, my victory won 
 May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's sun 
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall 
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all 
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all 
 Oh God, be my everything, be my delight 
 Be Jesus, my glory, my soul's satisfied 
 Oh God, be my everything, be my delight 
 Be Jesus, my glory, my soul's satisfied

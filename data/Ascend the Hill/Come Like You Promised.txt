Come Lord like You promised 
 Just like You said You would 
 Do not delay 
 Come with healing in Your touch 
 Come with fire in Your eyes 
 Just like You said You would 
 Come with grace and mercy 
 Come with judgment and might 
 Just like You said You would 
 Come riding on the wind 
 Through clouds of glory pierce the sky 
 Just like You said You would 
 Come and bring us back again 
 Lord come restore Your bride 
 Just like You said You would

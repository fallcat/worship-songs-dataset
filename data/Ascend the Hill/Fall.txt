Sometimes this world seems bigger than it is 
 And I just can't help but see it this way 
 And I know You're telling me to cast my cares aside and you know I try 
 But these walls I've built just won't let me see You 
 And these walls I've built just won't let me hear You 
 And these walls are just walls I've built between You and me 
 If I could see You, if I could hear You 
 Then I'd know I need You just as before 
 'Cause I've barricaded these tendencies 
 My selfish pride, these things inside, they always get the best of me 
 Show me love, teach me truth, break my heart and bring me back to You 
 Take these dreams, this is me, all I am here at Your feet 
 Take me as I am, with You I want to be 
 Of all this world it's you I wanna see 
 So I'm here on my knees 
 I need only to see Your face again 
 I need only to hear Your voice again 
 I have only all I am, all I am 
 And all I am is all I have in You 
 So I fall on my knees again 
 These walls are just I've built between You and me 
 I fall on my knees again

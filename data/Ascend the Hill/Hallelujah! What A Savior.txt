Man of Sorrows! what a name 
 For the Son of God, who came 
 Ruined sinners to reclaim 
 Hallelujah! What a Savior! 
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude, 
 In my place condemned He stood 
 He sealed my pardon with His blood 
 Hallelujah! What a Savior! 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Guilty, vile, and helpless me; 
 Spotless Lamb of God was He; 
 Full atonement! can it be? 
 Hallelujah! What a Savior! 
 Lifted up was He to die; 
 "It is finished!" was His cry; 
 Now in Heaven exalted high 
 Hallelujah! What a Savior! 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 When He comes, our glorious King, 
 All His ransomed home to bring, 
 Then anew this song we'll sing: 
 Hallelujah! What a Savior! 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Oh we sing Hallelujah to your name 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, etc. 
 Hallelujah to you Lord 
 Hallelujah to your wonderful name, Jesus 
 There's no one like you, God 
 There's no one like you, God

O Lord my God, 
 When I in awesome wonder 
 Consider all the works Thy Hand hath made 
 I see the stars 
 I hear the mighty thunder 
 Thy power throughout the universe displayed 
 When through the woods 
 And forest glades I wander 
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees 
 When I look down 
 From lofty mountain grandeur 
 And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 And when I think 
 My God, his Son not sparing 
 Sent him to die I scarce can take it in 
 That on the cross 
 My burden gladly bearing 
 He bled and died to take away my sin 
 When Christ shall come 
 With shouts of acclamation 
 And take me home, What joy shall fill my heart! 
 Then I shall bow 
 In humble adoration 
 And there proclaim, "My God, how great you are!" 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great your love for us! (Then sings my soul) 
 You shed you blood for us! (Then sings my soul) 
 How great your love for us! (Then sings my soul) 
 You shed you blood for us! (Then sings my soul) 
 How great your grace for us! 
 That you gave it all for us! 
 Then sings my soul, 
 My Saviour God, to Thee, 
 How great you are! 
 How great you are! 
 Then sings my soul, 
 My Saviour God, to Thee, 
 How great you are! 
 How great you are!

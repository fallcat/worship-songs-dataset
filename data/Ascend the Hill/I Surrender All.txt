All to Jesus I surrender; 
 All to him I freely give; 
 I will ever love and trust him, 
 In his presence daily live 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Humbly at his feet I bow, 
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken; 
 Take me, Jesus, take me now 
 I surrender all, I surrender all, 
 All to thee, my blessed Savior, 
 I surrender all 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Make me, Savior, wholly thine; 
 Let me fill the Holy Spirit 
 Truly know that thou art mine 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Lord, I give myself to thee; 
 Fill me with thy love and power; 
 Let thy blessing fall on me 
 I surrender all, I surrender all, 
 All to thee, my blessed Savior, 
 I surrender all 
 I surrender all, I surrender all, 
 All to thee, my blessed Savior, 
 I surrender all 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Now I feel the sacred flame. 
 Oh, the joy of full salvation! 
 Glory, glory, to your name!

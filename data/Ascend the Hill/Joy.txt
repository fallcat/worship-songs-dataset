Fill us with Your love till we're bursting at the seams 
 Overflow us with Your life and the joy that it brings and we'll lose ourselves 
 Oh we'll lose ourselves in You 
 Break the chains from our feet so we'll be dancing once again 
 Bring freedom to our hearts and we will never be the same 
 Oh we'll lose ourselves 
 Yeah we'll lose ourselves in You 
 'Cause we can't contain such joy 
 We can't contain it, we celebrate 
 It's joy unspeakable and full of glory 
 It's joy unspeakable and it's overflowing 
 Anoint our heads with the oil of Your joy 
 Holy Spirit come every burden to destroy 
 And we'll lose ourselves 
 Oh we'll lose ourselves in You 
 Give us beauty for ashes and gladness for mourning 
 Agarment of praise, for Your love is enduring 
 We've lost ourselves 
 Yeah we've lost ourselves in You 
 'Cause we can't contain such joy 
 We can't contain it, we celebrate 
 It's joy unspeakable and full of glory 
 It's joy unspeakable and it's overflowing 
 We can't contain this joy

Let we who call ourselves Yours 
 Let we who love Your name exalt in You, take refuge in You 
 And from here our sheltered place, we're lifting our hands 
 God we want Your embrace, yes we do 
 Oh God, we only want You! 
 Woah woah oh oh we love You, we love You 
 Woah woah oh oh we love You, we love You 
 Now with our hands and our hearts lifted high 
 This is our cry, we are Your Church, we're Your Bride 
 It's more than offering, it's more than sacrifice 
 This is love with all our hearts, with all understanding 
 Alove that's resounding with all of strength 
 With everything that we are 
 Woah woah oh oh we love You, we love You 
 Woah woah oh oh we love You, we love You 
 We're so in love with You, we're so in love with You 
 We're so in love with You we can't contain it 
 We can't contain it, no

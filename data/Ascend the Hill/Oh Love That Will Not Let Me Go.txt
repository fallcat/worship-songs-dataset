Oh, love that will not let me go 
 I rest my weary soul in thee 
 I give you back the life I owe 
 And in your ocean depths its flow 
 May richer, fuller be 
 My life is not my own 
 It's yours 
 My life is not my own 
 I know it's yours 
 Oh, light that follows all my way 
 I yield my flickering torch to thee 
 And my heart restores its borrowed ray 
 That in your sunshine's blaze its day 
 May brighter, fairer be 
 So light a fire in my heart 
 And I'll burn for you 
 So light a fire in my heart 
 And I'll burn for you 
 Oh, joy, that seeks me through the pain 
 I cannot close my heart to thee 
 I trace the rainbow through the rain 
 And feel the promise is not in vain 
 That morn shall tearless be 
 So anoint me with joy 
 And joyful I will be 
 So anoint me with joy 
 And joyful I will be 
 Oh, cross that's lifing up my head 
 I dare not ask to fly from thee 
 I lay in dust life's glory dead 
 And from the ground there blossoms red 
 Life that shall endless be 
 We will sing: 
 Holy, holy 
 Is the King of Kings 
 And we will sing: 
 Holy, holy 
 Is the King of Kings 
 On that day we will sing: 
 We will join with the angels and we will sing:

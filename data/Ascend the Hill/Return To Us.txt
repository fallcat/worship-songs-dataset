We come together with one voice lifted up to You our King 
 This song to You we sing 
 We're gathered in sacred assembly 
 Yes we are ready to see You once again 
 And now we bring our hearts to You, alone 
 In consecration, in expectation 
 Our God is merciful and gracious 
 He will hear our prayer 
 He will hear our prayer 
 Return to us once again Great God 
 We burn for You, we yearn for You Lord 
 And light a fire inside our hearts Great God 
 And we will burn for you, we will yearn for You Lord 
 We return to You, return to us again 
 Your fire in us anew

Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in thee; 
 Let the water and the blood, 
 From thy wounded side which flowed, 
 Be of sin the double cure; 
 Save from wrath and make me pure 
 Not the labors of my hands 
 Can fulfill thy law's demands; 
 Could my zeal no respite know, 
 Could my tears forever flow, 
 These for sin could not atone; 
 Thou must save, and thou alone 
 Nothing in my hand I bring, 
 Simply to the cross I cling; 
 Naked, come to thee for dress; 
 Helpless, look to thee for grace; 
 Foul, I to the fountain fly; 
 Wash me, Savior, or I die 
 Wash me, Savior, or I die 
 Wash me, Savior, or I die 
 While I draw this fleeting breath, 
 When mine eyes shall close in death, 
 When I rise to worlds unknown, 
 And behold thee on thy throne, 
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in thee 
 Let me hide myself in thee 
 Let me hide myself in thee

This we know, the Lord is God and we are Yours, we are your own 
 We understand, we know the truth, You made us Yours, we're Yours alone 
 So we enter in Your gates with thanksgiving 
 For You are good and Your mercy will defend 
 Your loving kindness lasts, it knows no end 
 And I sing, I sing, I sing of your faithfulness, I sing of your truth again 
 We make a joyful noise to You, to You oh Lord our praise is due 
 And with this song we bring You now, our heart's desire to sing it loud 
 So we come today, into Your courts singing praise 
 Into Your gates with thanksgiving 
 Into Your courts we're singing praise

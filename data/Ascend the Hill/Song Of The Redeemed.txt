And I was a sinner, an outsider 
 Seperated from the God I love 
 I carried a debt, a price on my head 
 I could not free myself from 
 And there was a burden, I could feel its heavy load 
 A judgement from above 
 I was slave to my shame, prisoner to the grave 
 Hoping for freedom 
 Then my story changed! 
 A weighty judgement was lifted on my behalf 
 And I was lost, yes, but I've been found 
 By an anchor that holds me fast 
 My redeemer, my reconciler 
 He has freed me from the past 
 And set me right, he called me by name 
 And lifted my curse at last! 
 Jesus, your name is lifted high 
 Jesus, your name is lifted high 
 And, oh, the joy of my burdens lifted 
 Of the prisoner set free 
 I went from stumbling through the darkness 
 To walking in light and now I can see 
 The hope that I have is sure and steadfast 
 Has bound my wandering heart to thee 
 So I'm singin', "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me" 
 And he took my place! 
 He paid a debt he did not owe 
 He came in the flesh, bore my sin and death 
 A fate that I will never know 
 And Jesus Christ, the ransom for all 
 He counted it joy to take the grave 
 And then God raised him from the dead 
 And in his name is the power to save! 
 Jesus, your name is lifted high 
 Jesus, your name is lifted high 
 This is the song of the redeemed 
 All praise and glory to our king 
 A thousand tongues therefore to sing 
 Extolling Jesus for eternity 
 This is the song of the redeemed 
 All praise, all glory to our king 
 A thousand tongues therefore to sing 
 Extolling Jesus for eternity

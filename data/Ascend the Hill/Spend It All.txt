I open up my eyes oh Lord, to see all the things You've done 
 I open up my heart oh God, to feel Your unfailing love 
 I open up my all to You, all my life for Your glory shown 
 I open up my soul to You alone, come make yourself at home 
 And I'll give all I have left to give 
 'Cause it's everything I am, Lord 
 And this life I'll spend it all for You 
 I'll waste it all on You 
 I offer up my mind to You, I long for the truth You know 
 I offer up my feet to You, they'll walk straight on the path You show 
 I offer up my time to You, so keep me and hold me still 
 I offer up my hands to You, Lord use them to do Your will 
 Let Your Spirit take me over God, 
 'Cause it's all I'll ever need, yeah You're all I'll ever need Lord 
 Receive this life an offering God 
 'Cause I've spent it all on You, yeah I'll spend it all on You God

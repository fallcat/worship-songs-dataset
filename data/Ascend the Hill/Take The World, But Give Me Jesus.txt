Take the world, but give me Jesus, 
 All its joys are but a name; 
 But His love abideth ever, 
 Through eternal years the same 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus, 
 Sweetest comfort of my soul; 
 With my Savior watching over me, 
 I can sing though billows roll 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus, 
 Let me view His constant smile; 
 Then throughout this life's long journey 
 He will lead me all the while 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus. 
 In His cross my trust shall be, 
 Till, with clearer, brighter vision, 
 Face to face my Lord I see! 
 So take the world, but give me Jesus 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus 
 Oh, the height and depth of mercy! 
 Oh, the length and breadth of love! 
 Oh, the fullness of redemption, 
 Pledge of endless life above! 
 Oh, the height and depth of mercy! 
 Oh, the length and breadth of love! 
 Oh, the fullness of redemption, 
 Pledge of endless life above! 
 So take the world, but give me Jesus 
 So take the world, but give me Jesus 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus 
 Take the world, but give me Jesus

The love of God is greater far 
 Than tongue or pen can ever tell 
 It goes beyond the highest star 
 And reaches to the lowest hell 
 The guilty pair, bowed down with care, 
 God gave His only Son to win 
 His erring child He reconciled: 
 You and I pardoned from our sin. 
 Oh love of God, how rich and pure! 
 It shall forevermore endure 
 How measureless and strong! 
 The saints' and angels' song we sing 
 Holy, holy 
 When ancient time shall pass away, 
 And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall 
 When men here refuse to pray, 
 And rocks and hills and mountains call 
 God's love, so sure, shall still endure 
 All measureless and strong 
 Redeeming grace to Adam's race 
 Shall be the saints' and angels' song 
 Could we with ink the ocean fill 
 And were the skies of parchment made 
 Were every stalk on earth a quill 
 And every man a scribe by trade 
 To write the love of God above 
 Would drain the ocean dry 
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole 
 Though stretched from sky to sky 
 How measureless and strong! 
 The saints' and angels' song we sing 
 Holy, holy 
 How measureless and strong! 
 The saints' and angels' song we sing 
 Holy, holy

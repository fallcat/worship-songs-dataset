I open my eyes to the breathtaking splendor of brand new skies 
 I come alive 
 Heart pounding 
 Voice resounding 
 This is the sound of my rebounding 
 A creator's brand I bare 
 And forfeit the scars of a love to share 
 This is the sound of foundations shaking history in the making 
 This is reformation 
 This is love overtaking 
 This is the sound of redemption 
 This is here 
 This is now 
 This is love overtaking me

We're tossing pennies in the well, empty pockets all turned out 
 Happy shining blessed are the ones who hunger 
 When our poverty is plain, I'll try to burn it in my brain 
 Trace a line around your face to paint a picture 
 So further up and further in we have nowhere else to go 
 As we plant the seeds of toil and tears, it's beauty we will sow 
 Blessed are the ones, Oh blessed are the ones 
 Blessed are the hungry ones 
 Let's build a house with turned out doors, so we can share what love affords 
 Pour ourselves out like a wine that we've been saving 
 So, when our well is running dry, and when we raise our glasses high 
 Happy, shining are the faces of the thirsty 
 So further up and further in we have nowhere else to go 
 But you give us seeds of toil and tears, it's beauty we will sow 
 And blessed are the ones, Oh, blessed are the ones 
 Blessed are the thirsty ones 
 Love is all, love is all, love is all, yeah, love is all, love is all we need 
 So further up and further in we have no place else to go 
 And when all we have is what we need, its joy that we will sow 
 Blessed are the ones, Oh, blessed are the ones, 
 Blessed are the hungry ones. We are blessed, yeah

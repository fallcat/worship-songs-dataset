I am a blind man trying to find the way 
 A deaf man with my ear to the ground 
 Just listening for what You say 
 I've got no voice to sing the songs 
 Written by the prophets on the subway walls 
 The kingdom is a golden table and we are beggars all 
 Are these just some words that I say aloud? 
 Is this just the sun breaking through the clouds? 
 Oh, I know it's more and I know somehow that 
 Heaven is breaking through 
 And it's You, it's You, it's You, it's You, You 
 I've wandered deserts looking for a sign 
 A wild flower in a valley low 
 Just reaching for the light 
 I have no place to lay my head, no sanctuary of my own 
 The kingdom waits with open arms 
 For pilgrims headed home 
 Are these just some words that I say aloud? 
 Is this just the sun breaking through the clouds? 
 Oh, I know it's more and I know somehow that 
 Heaven is breaking through 
 And it's You, it's You, it's You, it's You, it's You 
 (I am a blind man trying to find the way) 
 I'm looking for 
 (I am a blind man trying to find the way) 
 Heaven is breaking, heaven is breaking 
 (I am a blind man trying to find the way) 
 Heaven is breaking through 
 Heaven is breaking, heaven is breaking 
 (I am a blind man trying to find the way) 
 Heaven is breaking through 
 Oh, heaven is breaking, heaven is breaking 
 (I am a blind man trying to find the way) 
 Heaven is breaking through 
 Heaven is breaking, heaven is breaking 
 (I am a blind man trying to find the way) 
 Heaven is breaking through 
 And it's You, it's You, it's You, it's You, yeah 
 It's You, it's You, it's You, You 
 I am a blind man trying to find the way

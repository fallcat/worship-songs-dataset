You've been let down, it's true 
 Your pain is so easy to see 
 You're hunted by your history 
 And it feels like you've got no escape 
 Your life left you high and dry 
 You used to be sure of yourself 
 But then your whole world went to hell 
 And tomorrow looks just like today 
 So, you lie on your bed, you won't let the morning come in 
 And you hide in your room, feeding that fear and its killing you 
 Don't you know 
 That its killing me too, cause your heart break is breaking you 
 I miss the life in your eyes 
 The home that I found in your arms 
 And now you don't know who you are 
 But I won't give up on you 
 On no 
 You lie on your bed, you won't let the morning come in 
 And you hide in your room, feeding that fear and its killing you 
 Don't you know 
 That its killing me too, cause your heart break is breaking you 
 And you lost your fire 
 And your flame's gone out 
 And your down on your knees 
 Cause your life is not what you thought it would be 
 No, 
 Lift up your head 
 Help is on the way 
 And it won't pass you by 
 You just gotta reach out your hand 
 Lift up your eyes 
 Love is on the way 
 And it won't pass you by 
 You just gotta reach out your hand 
 Go on and lift up your head 
 Because love is on its way 
 And it won't pass you by 
 You've just gotta reach out your hand

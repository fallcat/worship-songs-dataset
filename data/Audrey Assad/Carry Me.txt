Pain is a forest we all get lost in 
 Between the branches hope can be so hard to see 
 And in the darkness we've all got questions 
 We're all just trying to make sense out of suffering but 
 You say I am blessed because of this 
 So, I choose to believe 
 As I carry this cross, You'll carry me 
 Help me believe it 
 Fear is a current we all get caught in 
 And in its motion faith can be so hard to find 
 And we all falter 'cause we're all broken 
 We're all just trying to turn the shadows into light but 
 You get glory in the midst of this 
 And You're walking with me 
 And you say I am blessed because of this 
 So, I choose to believe 
 As I carry this cross, You'll carry me 
 And I know Your promises are faithful 
 And God, I've seen Your goodness in my life 
 And oh, I've found Your mercy is a river 
 Your love is an ocean wide 
 You say I am blessed because of this 
 You get glory in the midst of this 
 And You're walking with me 
 And You say I am blessed because of this 
 So, I choose to believe 
 As I carry this cross, as I carry this cross 
 'Cause as I carry this cross, You'll carry me 
 You'll carry me, God 
 You'll carry me 
 And Your love is an ocean wide

How did I get here standing in a mess that I have made? 
 Little by little adding to the chaos everyday 
 I know it's time, it's time to come clean 
 I know it's time, it's time to come clean 
 Boxes full of things I've shuffled and shifted place to place 
 All the years of me, everything I want to keep and throw away 
 I know it's time, it's time to come clean 
 I know it's time, it's time to come clean 
 I empty out the pieces 
 And I put them where they go 
 But where do they go? 
 Where do they go? 
 Does anything in me know? 
 Where do they go? 
 I'm finding what I've covered and holding it up to the morning light 
 I'm opening my life a little at a time and it's all right 
 'Cause it takes time, it takes time to come clean 
 Yeah, and I know it's time, it's time to come clean 
 I'm picking up the pieces 
 And I put them where they go 
 But where do they go? 
 Where do they go? 
 Does anything in me know? 
 Where do they go? 
 Where do they go? 
 I'm picking up the pieces 
 So where do they go? 
 Where do they go? 
 I wanna know just where do they go? 
 Where do they go 
 Because I need to know 
 Just where do they go? Where do they go? 
 I've got to know just where do they go? 
 Where do they go? Will I ever know?

Death, be not proud, though the whole world fear you: 
 Mighty and dreadful you may seem, 
 But death, be not proud, for your pride has failed you 
 You will not kill me. 
 Though you may dwell in plague and poison, 
 You're a slave to fate and desperate men, 
 So death, if your sleep be the gates to Heaven, 
 Why your confidence? 
 When you will be no more, 
 You will be no more, 
 When you will be no more. 
 Even death will die. 
 Even death will die. 
 Death, be not proud. 
 Death, be not proud. 
 Death, be not proud, 
 Cause even death will die.

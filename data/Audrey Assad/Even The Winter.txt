What if we find ourselves beneath the snow, 
 Our warmest words all frozen in our throats 
 And all we feel is left out in the cold, 
 You and I? 
 What if the days grow short and lose their light? 
 What if the coals burn black and the embers die? 
 And we can't find each other in the night? 
 You and I 
 Even the winter won't last forever 
 We'll see the morning, we'll feel the sun 
 We'll wake up in April, ready and able 
 Sowing the seeds in the soil 
 Of our love 
 Of our love 
 What if the ice we tread is just too thin? 
 What if we can't escape the squall we're in? 
 What if our hearts of stone are permanent? 
 You and I 
 Even the winter won't last forever 
 We'll see the morning, we'll feel the sun 
 We'll wake up in April, ready and able 
 Sowing the seeds in the soil 
 Of our love 
 Of our love 
 What if the spring comes soon 
 And we're surprised? 
 What if the seasons help us realize, 
 Some things are only proven over time? 
 You know 
 Even the winter won't last forever 
 We'll see the morning, we'll feel the sun 
 We'll wake up in April, ready and able 
 Sowing the seeds in the soil 
 Of our love 
 Of our love 
 Even the darkness cannot disarm us 
 We'll break up the earth, because we know 
 That it's worth it 
 Sowing the seeds in the soil of our love.

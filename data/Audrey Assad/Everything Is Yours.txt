When all the world is blossoming 
 When everything around is bursting into life 
 And I don't have to strain to hear the beat of Your heart 
 Oh, Oh 
 When all the world is under fire 
 And the skies are threatening to thunder and rain 
 And I am overcome by fears that I can't see 
 Oh, Oh 
 If everything is Yours 
 Everything is Yours 
 If everything is Yours 
 I'm letting it go 
 No it was never mine to hold 
 No, never mine 
 Who could command the stars to sing 
 Or hold the raging seas from breaking through the doors 
 Until the fragile roses wear the very same hand 
 Oh, Oh 
 If everything is Yours 
 Everything is Yours 
 If everything is Yours 
 I'm letting it go 
 I am, I'm letting it go 
 Letting go, I'm letting it go 
 Cause everything is Yours 
 Yeah everything is Yours 
 If everything is Yours, God 
 If everything is Yours 
 If everything is Yours 
 I'm letting it go 
 Let it go, let it go, let it go 
 It was never mine to hold 
 No, It was never mine, never mine 
 No

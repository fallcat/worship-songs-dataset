You live in a million places 
 Your fingerprints can be seen on a million faces 
 There is a trace of You in every hallelujah 
 Every song that I sing 
 And for love of You, I'm a sky on fire 
 And because of You, I come alive 
 It's Your sacred heart within me beating 
 Your voice within me singing out 
 For love of You, oh, for love of You 
 It's all You, yeah 
 You are the highway I travel 
 'Cause I watched You carve streets of gold from the sand and gravel 
 I gave You brokenness, You gave me innocence 
 And now this road leads to glory 
 And for love of You, I'm a sky on fire 
 And because of You, I come alive 
 And it's Your sacred heart within me beating 
 Your voice within me singing out 
 For love of You, yeah 
 You are my deepest longing and so I see You everywhere 
 It's You I'm chasin' after 
 'Cause I am captivated by who You are and how You move 
 I'll follow You forever 
 For love of You, I'm a sky on fire 
 Because of You, I come alive, yeah 
 For love of You, I'm a sky on fire 
 Because of You, I come alive 
 It's Your sacred heart within me beating 
 Your voice within me singing out 
 For love of You, oh, for love of You 
 Oh, so, for love of You, God 
 And everything I do 
 Oh, so, for the love of You, You

The fullness of the Godhead knit with our humanity 
 Flesh and bones sewn in the heart of God inseparably 
 I know, I know, and I believe You are the Lord 
 I know, I know, and I believe You are the Lord 
 Help my unbelief. 
 Strange and sweet collision of justice and mercy 
 Your burden is light and your yoke is easy. 
 I know, I know, and I believe that You are the Lord 
 I know, I know, and I believe that You are the Lord 
 Help my unbelief. 
 O happy fault that gained for me the chance to know you, Lord 
 To touch your wounded side and know the joy of my reward 
 I know, I know, and I believe that You are the Lord 
 I know, I know, and I believe that You are the Lord 
 Help my unbelief. 
 My Lord and my God 
 My Lord and my God 
 I know, I know, and I believe 
 I know, I know, and I believe 
 Help my unbelief.

Humble and human, willing to bend You are 
 Fashioned of flesh and the fire of life, You are 
 Not too proud to wear our skin 
 To know this weary world we're in 
 Humble, humble Jesus 
 Humble in sorrow, You gladly carried Your cross 
 Never refusing Your life to the weakest of us 
 Not too proud to bear our sin 
 To feel this brokenness we're in 
 Humble, humble Jesus 
 We bow our knees 
 We must decrease 
 You must increase 
 We lift You high 
 Humble in greatness, born in the likeness of man 
 Name above all names, holding our world in Your hands 
 Not too proud to dwell with us, to live in us, to die for us 
 Humble, humble Jesus 
 We lift You high 
 We lift You high

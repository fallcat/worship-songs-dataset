As the dew falls on the blade 
 You have touched all this fragile frame 
 And as a mother knows her baby's face 
 You know me, You know me 
 As the summer air within my chest 
 I have breathed You deep down into my breast 
 And as You know the hairs upon my head 
 Every thought and every word I've said 
 Every thought and every word I've said 
 Savior, You have known me as I am 
 Healer, You have known me as I was 
 As I will be in the morning, in the evening 
 You have known me, yeah, You know me 
 Oh, and as the exhilaration of autumn's bite 
 Oh, You have brought these tired bones to brilliant life 
 And as the swallow knows, she knows the sky 
 This is how it is with You and I 
 Oh, this is how it is with You and I 
 Savior, You have known me as I am 
 Healer, You have known me as I was 
 As I will be in the morning, in the evening 
 You have known me, yeah, You know me 
 From the fall of my heart to the resurrection of my soul 
 You know me, God, and You know my ways 
 In my rising and my sitting down 
 You see me as I am, oh, see me as I am 
 And as a lover knows his beloved's heart 
 All the shapes and curves of her even in the dark 
 Oh, You have formed one in my inward parts 
 And You know me, You know me, yes 
 Savior, You, You have known me as I am 
 Oh, healer, You have known me as I was 
 As I will be in the morning, in the evening 
 You have known 
 You have known me, in the morning, in the evening 
 You've known me, God 
 In the morning, in the evening You have known me 
 Yeah, You've know me 
 You have always known me 
 You know me, God, You have known me 
 You have always known my heart

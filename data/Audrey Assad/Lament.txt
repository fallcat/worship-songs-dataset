I'm Mary and I'm Martha all at the same time; 
 I'm sitting at His feet and yet I'm dying to be recognized. 
 I am a picture of contentment and I am dissatisfied. 
 Why is it easy to work but hard to rest sometimes, 
 Sometimes, sometimes 
 I'm restless, and I rustle like a thousand tall trees; 
 I'm twisting and I'm turning in an endless daydream. 
 You wrestle me at night and I wake in search of You 
 But try as I might, I just can't catch You 
 But I want to, 'cause I need You, yes, I need You 
 I can't catch You, but I want to. 
 How long, how long until I'm home? 
 I'm so tired, so tired of running 
 How long until You come for me? 
 How long, how long until I'm home? 
 I'm so tired, so tired of running 
 How long until You come for me? 
 I'm so tired, so tired of running 
 Yeah, I'm so tired, so tired of running 
 I'm so tired, so tired of running

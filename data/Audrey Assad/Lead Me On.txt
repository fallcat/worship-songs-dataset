From the love of my own comfort 
 From the fear of having nothing 
 From a life of worldly passions 
 Deliver me O God 
 From the need to be understood 
 From the need to be accepted 
 From the fear of being lonely 
 Deliver me O God 
 Deliver me O God 
 And I shall not want, I shall not want 
 When I taste Your goodness I shall not want 
 When I taste Your goodness I shall not want 
 From the fear of serving others 
 From the fear of death or trial 
 From the fear of humility 
 Deliver me O God 
 Deliver me O God

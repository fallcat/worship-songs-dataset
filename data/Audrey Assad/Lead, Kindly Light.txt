Lead, kindly light, amidst the grey and gloom 
 The night is long and I am far from home 
 Here in the dark, I do not ask to see 
 The path ahead--one step enough for me 
 Lead on, lead on, kindly light. 
 I was not ever willing to be led 
 I could have stayed, but I ran instead 
 In spite of fear, I followed my pride 
 My eyes could see, but my heart was blind 
 Lead on, lead on, kindly light. 
 And in the night, when I was afraid 
 Your feet beside my own on the way 
 Each stumbling step where other men have trod 
 Shortens the road leading home to my God 
 Lead on, lead on, 
 My God, my God, 
 Lead on, lead on, kindly light.

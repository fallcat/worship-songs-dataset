"Love Is Moving" 
 The hem of His robe is where our healing lies 
 The wounds in His hands are where our life resides 
 Love is moving, moving among us 
 The beat of His heart our steady rhythm 
 A soul of a King and a Kingdom 
 Love is moving, moving among us 
 Love moves 
 Love is moving, moving among us 
 He illuminates with a holy fire 
 And it burns with the flame of God's desire 
 Love is moving, moving among us 
 The power of God is in His presence 
 And the mercy of Heaven in His movement 
 Love is moving, moving among us 
 Right now, yeah 
 Love is moving, moving among us 
 So we reach, we reach our hands to Him 
 To touch, to touch the Healer's hand 
 We fall, we fall in worship 
 Our God is with us 
 So we reach, we reach our hands to Him 
 Just to touch, to touch the Healer's hand 
 We fall, we fall in worship 
 Our God is with us 
 Love is moving, moving among us 
 Yeah, love is moving, moving among us 
 Yeah, love is moving, is moving among us 
 God is moving, moving among us

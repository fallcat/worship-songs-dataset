Far-off hymns and funeral marches sound the same again 
 My ears are worn and weary strangers in a strange land 
 And I need a new song. I need a new song 
 And all I am is breath and vapor and shadow 
 And all I have is what I need and this I know 
 I need a new song 
 I need a new song 
 Waiting in the night for you. Burning in the sky for you, you 
 There's an aching in my body, within my lungs 
 This web of bones around my heart is coming undone 
 'Cause I, I need a new song. I need a new song 
 I'm waiting in the night for you, burning in the sky for you, you 
 Waiting in the night for you, I'm burning in the sky for you 
 Words are failing, my melodies falter; 
 My voice is breaking; my heart is burning 
 Because blessing and honor, glory and power, praise and worship, They belong to you 
 I need a new, I need a new, 
 I need a new, I need a new, 
 I need a new so 
 I sing a new song 
 I need a new, I need a new, 
 I need a new, I need a new 
 I need a new so 
 I sing a new song 
 I need a new, I need a new, 
 I need a new, I need a new, 
 I need a new so 
 I sing a new song 
 Far-off hymns and funeral marches 
 All I am is breath and vapor and shadow 
 All I have is what I need and this I know

My little heart is swelling with a song from somewhere else, 
 It's filling up with glory and I'm ringing like a bell, 
 My little heart, my little heart is racing, 
 It's racing just to keep up with your love and live to tell, and live to tell, 
 And it's all I know 
 I'm following behind you, 
 I'm staying close beside you, 
 I've got nothing to lose, and I've got everything to find 
 There's something in your laughter, 
 That keeps me running after, 
 I'm breathing to the beat of your heart and leaving the world behind, 
 No turning back 
 My violence, my vices, they don't keep me warm at night, 
 My worries and wasted hopes look washed out in the light, 
 My little heart, my little heart is flying, 
 My little heart, it longs for the kindness in your eyes, its in your eyes, 
 And it's all I know, 
 I'm following behind you, 
 I'm staying close beside you, 
 I've got nothing to lose, and I've got everything to find, 
 There's something in your laughter, 
 That keeps me running after, 
 I'm breathing to the beat of your heart and leaving the world behind, 
 No turning back 
 Though none go with me 
 Still I will follow (3X) 
 No turning back, no turning back, 
 I'm following behind you, beside you, 
 I've got nothing to lose, and I've got everything to find, 
 There's something in your laughter, 
 That keeps me running after, 
 I'm breathing the beat of your heart and leaving the world behind, 
 No turning back (5X)

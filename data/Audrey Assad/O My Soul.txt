Rivers and stones and the trees of the field, they sing in the night 
 And a thousand tongues lay deep in your lungs to raise to the sky 
 Don't lie to yourself, o my soul-love your God. 
 Deep in your heart you feather and tar your folly and fear: 
 Expose them for the fools they are, and the world comes clear. 
 Don't lie to yourself, o my soul-love your God. 
 Your worries will never love you 
 They'll leave you all alone 
 But your God will not forsake you 
 O my soul. 
 Deep in your heart you feather and tar your folly and fear: 
 Expose them for the fools they are, and the world comes clear. 
 Don't lie to yourself, o my soul-love your God. 
 Your worries will never love you 
 They'll leave you all alone 
 But your God will not forsake you 
 O my soul.

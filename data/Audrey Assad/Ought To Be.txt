I love you more than a slow falling summer rain 
 Or in the silence that only the snow leaves behind 
 I love you more 
 And I love you better than the gray of the autumn air 
 Better than the spring in it's blooming against the sky 
 I love you more 
 It may not be red as a rose is yet 
 It may not be strong as the old oak trees 
 But love planted deeply becomes what it ought to be 
 Your love is steady and sure as a mountain's high 
 Moving my heart like a river that gently bends 
 Your love is sure 
 Your love is wide open spaces where I can run 
 And yet we're tangled up roots in the warm broken earth 
 Yeah our love is sure 
 And it may not be clear as a morning yet 
 It may not be wide as a restless sea 
 But love given freely becomes what it ought to be 
 And it may not be clear as a morning yet 
 It may not be wide as a restless sea 
 And it may not be red as a rose is yet 
 It may not be strong as the old oak trees 
 But love planted deeply becomes what it ought to and 
 Hearts given freely become what they ought to and 
 Love planted deeply becomes what it ought to be 
 What it ought to be

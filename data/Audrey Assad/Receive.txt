Holy Wisdom, God in Heaven 
 Here in human time 
 Humble Godhead bending low and 
 Touching bread and wine. 
 Faith is making plain the truth beneath the veil 
 Faith supplying where our feeble sense fail 
 To the Father, to the Son, 
 And to the Spirit be 
 Blessing, honour, glory, power, 
 Might, and majesty 
 It is God who we encounter, 
 It is God that we receive 
 From this altar we do believe 
 Jesus by Your hand you feed us 
 Your own life and bread 
 Jesus risen, Savior lead us 
 Out of sin and death 
 Word of God in flesh and blood, we're here for You 
 Bread of life, the love of God, our heav'nly food 
 To the Father, to the Son, 
 And to the Spirit be 
 Blessing, honour, glory, power, 
 Might, and majesty 
 It is God who we encounter, 
 It is God that we receive 
 From this altar we do believe 
 To the Father, to the Son, 
 And to the Spirit be 
 Blessing, honour, glory, power, 
 Might, and majesty 
 It is God who we encounter, 
 It is God that we receive 
 From this altar 
 From this altar 
 From this altar we do believe

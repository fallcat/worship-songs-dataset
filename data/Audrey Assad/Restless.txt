You dwell in the songs that we are singing, 
 Rising to the Heavens, rising to Your heart, Your heart. 
 Our praises filling up the spaces 
 In between our frailty and everything You are 
 You are the keeper of my heart 
 And I'm restless, I'm restless 
 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You 
 I am restless, I'm restless 
 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You 
 Oh God, I wanna rest in You 
 Oh, speak now for my soul is listening 
 Say that You have saved me, whisper in the dark, the dark. 
 'Cause I know You're more than my salvation 
 Without you I am hopeless, tell me who You are 
 You are the keeper of my heart 
 You are the keeper of my heart 
 And I'm restless, I'm restless 
 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You 
 I am restless, I'm restless 
 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You, Oh 
 I wanna rest in You 
 Still my heart, hold me close 
 Let me hear, a still small voice 
 Let it grow, let it rise 
 Into a shout, into a cry 
 Still my heart, hold me close 
 Let me hear, a still small voice 
 Let it grow, let it rise 
 Into a shout, into a cry 
 And I am restless, I'm restless 
 'Til I rest in You, let me rest in You 
 And I am restless, so restless 
 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You, Oh God 
 Let me rest in You.

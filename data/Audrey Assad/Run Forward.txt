Oh won't you show what you're feeling 
 Is it too much to ask that your heart be revealing 
 Just a little bit, Oh just a little bit, just a little 
 I don't think I've ever informed you I love you desperately 
 Even while I only know you just a little bit 
 Oh, just a little bit, just a little 
 Oh how'd we get so disconnected? 
 My heart is shutting down, I just can't let it 
 So I'll run forward and pray you fall back 
 Grace will come and clear your path, yeah 
 I'll run forward and you fall back 
 Come back 
 Oh you treat your time like you own it 
 It's slipping fast away, and you're not getting younger 
 Not even a bit, no not even a bit, no not at all 
 This love is a battle we're fighting, you've laid your armor down 
 Oh and now I can't fight it 
 Not even a bit, no not even a bit, no not at all 
 Oh, you took your love for granted 
 But, oh, it never left you for a second 
 So I'll run forward and pray you fall back 
 Grace will come and clear your path, yeah 
 I'll run forward and you fall back 
 Oh I'll run forward and you fall back 
 You made me afraid 
 Thank you I've gotta thank you 
 Cause now I know His strength 
 Thank you, Oh God I thank You 
 So please don't run away, no, don't go 
 So I'll run forward and pray you run back 
 Grace will come and clear my path, yeah 
 I'll run forward if you run back 
 Yeah I'll run forward if you run back 
 Oh I'll run forward and you fall back 
 Come back 
 I'll pray you come back, my love, come back 
 And grace will come to clear your path 
 Oh I'll run forward if you fall back 
 Come back, my love, come back

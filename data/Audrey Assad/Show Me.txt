You could plant me like a tree beside a river 
 You could tangle me in soil and let my roots run wild 
 And I would blossom like a flower in the desert 
 But for now just let me cry 
 You could raise me like a banner in the battle 
 Put victory like fire behind my shining eyes 
 And I would drift like falling snow over the embers 
 But for now just let me lie 
 Bind up these broken bones 
 Mercy burn and bring me back to life 
 But not before you show me how to die 
 Set me like a star before the morning 
 Like a sun that steals the darkness from a world asleep 
 And I'll illuminate the path You've laid before me 
 But for now just let me be 
 Bind up these broken bones 
 Mercy burn and bring me back to life 
 But not before You show me how to die 
 No, not before You show me how to die 
 So let me go like a leaf upon the water 
 Let me brave the wild currents flowing to the sea 
 And I will disappear into a deeper beauty 
 But for now just stay with me 
 God, for now just stay with me

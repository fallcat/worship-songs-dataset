You've drawn so close 
 That it's hard to see you 
 And you speak so softly 
 That it's hard to hear you 
 And I guess that's what I get 
 For inviting you in 
 Because you took me at my word 
 And now I know 
 Faith is not a fire 
 As much as it's a glow 
 A quiet lovely burning 
 Underneath the snow 
 And it's not too much 
 It's just enough to get me home 
 Cause love moves slow 
 Love moves slow 
 You've grown so deep 
 That it's hard to miss you 
 And you come so near 
 That it's hard to feel you 
 Oh, and I guess that's how it is 
 When I let you move 
 Because you take me at my word 
 Oh, and now I know 
 That faith is not a fire 
 As much as it's a glow 
 A steady humble lamplight 
 In the window 
 And it's not too much 
 It's just enough to get me home 
 'Cause love moves slow 
 Love moves slow 
 I heard that faith moves mountains 
 I know it moves my feet 
 To follow you 
 And maybe I'm a mountain 
 Because it's moving me 
 To follow you 
 My faith is not a fire 
 As much as it's a glow 
 A little burning ember 
 In my weary soul 
 And it's not too much 
 It's just enough to get me home 
 Because your love moves slow 
 Yeah, your love moves slow 
 So I move slow 
 Because you move slow 
 Love moves slow 
 Let's move slow

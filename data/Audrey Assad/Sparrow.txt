Why should I be lonely, 
 Long for heaven and home 
 When Jesus is my portion 
 And a constant Friend I know 
 I sing because I'm happy, 
 I sing because I'm free 
 For His eye is on the sparrow, 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know He's watching me 
 Why should I be troubled 
 When His tender word I hear 
 Know I rest on His goodness 
 In my doubt and in my fear 
 I sing because I'm happy, 
 I sing because I'm free 
 For His eye is on the sparrow, 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know... 
 I sing because I'm happy, 
 I sing because I'm free 
 For His eye is on the sparrow, 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know He's watching me 
 He's watching me 
 He's watching you 
 He's watching me

O Spirit of the living God, thou Light and Fire Divine 
 Descend upon Thy Church once more and make it truly Thine 
 Fill it with love and joy and power, with righteousness and peace 
 Till Christ shall dwell in human hearts, and sin and sorrow cease. 
 Blow, wind of God, with wisdom blow until our minds are free 
 From mists of error, clouds of doubt, which blind our eyes to Thee 
 Burn, winged fire, inspire our lips with flaming love and zeal 
 To preach to all Thy great good news, God's glorious commonweal. 
 So shall we know the power of Christ, who came this world to save 
 So shall we rise with Him to life which soars beyond the grave 
 And earth shall win true holiness which makes Thy children whole 
 Till, perfected by Thee, we reach creation's glorious goal.

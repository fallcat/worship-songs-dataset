Yeah these are old shoes that I've been walking in 
 I'm wearing weary like it's a second skin 
 I've been looking for a place to lay my head 
 All this time like a vagabond 
 A homeless stranger 
 I've been wandering 
 All my life you've been calling me 
 To a home you know I've been needing 
 I'm a broken stone 
 So lay me in the house you're building 
 (Yeah come on) 
 You are a shelter for every misfit soul 
 We are the four walls and you're the cornerstone 
 You are 
 And you're the solid rock that we are built upon 
 And all this time like a vagabond 
 A homeless stranger 
 I've been wandering 
 And all my life you've been calling me 
 To a home you know that I've been needing 
 I'm a broken stone 
 So lay me in the house you're building 
 'Cause in you I find my meaning, yeah 
 And in you I find my beauty 
 All this time like a vagabond 
 A homeless stranger 
 I've been wandering 
 All my life you've been calling me 
 To a home you know I've been needing 
 All this time like a vagabond 
 A homeless stranger 
 I've been wandering 
 All my life you've been calling me 
 To a home you know I've been needing 
 I'm a broken stone 
 So lay me in the house you're building 
 Lay me in the house you're building 
 In the house you're building

I know that the hardest 
 Part of love is not the 
 Things I have to give, no... 
 It's what I give up I'm giving up ground 
 I'm trading in my solitude for safety now. All my pride, 
 It doesn't stand a chance against the way you move. 
 You're tearing up roots and breaking down walls. 
 I don't stand a chance at all against the way you move. 
 You're like a lion standing in my house 
 And you're taking off the doors on your way in ... 
 I got nothing left 
 To hide behind. You're reading all my faith and all 
 My fear in my eyes... 
 All my pride, you know it doesn't 
 Stand a chance against the way 
 You move you're tearing up my 
 Roots and breaking down 
 Walls and I don't stand a 
 Chance at all against the way 
 You move... 
 All my pride, you know it doesn't 
 Stand a chance against the way 
 You move you're tearing up my 
 Roots and breaking down 
 Walls and I don't stand a 
 Chance at all against the way 
 You move...

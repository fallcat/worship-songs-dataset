There's a train leaving your heart tonight 
 There's a silence inside your head and you're running from it 
 Down the tracks on a midnight line 
 There's a red moon in the sky and you're running from it 
 But I'm coming for you, coming for you, wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 Wrestling angels till dawn breaks through 
 There's a blessing in the wound and you're running from it 
 When all your demons are at your door 
 It's a soldier they're looking for and you're running from it 
 But I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you, wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 Across the sea, the space between everything you think you know, 
 The things you keep and bury deep underneath the melting snow - 
 I'll follow 
 Fathers and mothers don't always come through, 
 But I'm never gonna stop following you 
 Prophets and lovers don't always hold true, 
 But I'm never gonna stop falling for you 
 So, when your wine's all gone and your well runs dry, 
 Open your hands and look into my eyes; all that you see here, 
 You'll soon leave behind, so open your hands and look into my eyes 
 'Cause I'm coming for you, coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you wherever you go 
 Fathers and mothers don't always come through, 
 But I'm never gonna stop following you 
 Prophets and lovers don't always hold true, 
 But I'm never gonna stop falling for you

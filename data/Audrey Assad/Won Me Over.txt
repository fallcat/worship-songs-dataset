Was on the run, a road that I ruined, 
 Chasing a lie I thought I believed in, 
 Don't know why I do what I do 
 Running from you, is running to you 
 You're everywhere... I couldn't escape 
 You never stop - you never do. 
 I was full of fear and prone to wander, 
 Lost and lonely till the day you won me over, you won me over 
 I was halfway gone and going nowhere 
 Half alive until the day you won me over, you won me over, over 
 I should have known what I was missing 
 If I were you, I would have stopped chasing 
 Your love's too strong to let me go. 
 I was full of fear and prone to wander, 
 Lost and lonely till the day you won me over, you won me over 
 I was halfway gone and going nowhere 
 Half alive until the day you won me over, you won me over, over, yeah 
 I was full of fear and prone to wander. 
 Till you won me over, you won me over 
 I was halfway gone and going nowhere. 
 Till you won me over, till you won me over 
 Yeah, till you won, yeah 
 I was halfway gone and going nowhere...

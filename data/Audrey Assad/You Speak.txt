You liberate me from my own noise and my own chaos 
 From the chains of a lesser law You set me free 
 You liberate me from my own noise and my own chaos 
 From the chains of a lesser law You set me free 
 In the silence of the heart You speak 
 In the silence of the heart You speak 
 And it is there that I will know You 
 And You will know me 
 In the silence of the heart 
 You speak, You speak. 
 You satisfy me till I am quiet and confident 
 In the work of the Spirit I cannot see. 
 You satisfy me till I am quiet and confident 
 In the work of the Spirit I cannot see. 
 In the silence of the heart You speak.

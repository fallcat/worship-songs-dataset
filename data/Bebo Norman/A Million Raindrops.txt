Can I feel the sun? 
 Breaking through the gray I'm lost within 
 Can I hear the wind? 
 Like a secret telling me I'll live again 
 I need you 
 All your thoughts, let them fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 On this desolate ground I'm standing on 
 Every word from your lips 
 Like a father's kiss 
 That all my life I've waited on 
 Can I walk the line? 
 Tell me, will you be my safety net? 
 Can you save a life? 
 Tangled up in weakness and regret 
 I know you can 
 All your thoughts, let them fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 On this desolate ground I'm standing on 
 Every word from your lips 
 Like a father's kiss 
 That all my life I've waited on 
 That all my life I've waited on 
 I'm crying out to you 
 I'm crying out to you, yeah 
 There's nothing left to lose 
 There's nothing left to prove, yeah 
 I'm crying out to you 
 I'm crying out to you 
 All your thoughts, let them fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 On this desolate ground I'm standing on 
 Every word from your lips 
 Like a father's kiss 
 That all my life I've waited on 
 All your thoughts, let them fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 On this desolate ground I'm standing on 
 Every word from your lips 
 Like a father's kiss 
 That all my life I've waited on 
 That all my life I've waited on

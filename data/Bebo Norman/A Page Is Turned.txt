A page is turned by the wind to a boy with curly grin 
 With a world to conquer at the age of ten 
 But as history unfolds and the storybook is told 
 He finds salvation not at the hands of man 
 And the God of second chance 
 Picked him up and He let him dance 
 Through a world that is not kind 
 And all this time, preparing him the one 
 To hold him up when he comes undone 
 Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
 And now a man, here you stand 
 Your day has come 
 A page is turned in this world to reveal a little girl 
 With a heart that's bigger, as it is unfurled 
 By the language in her soul, that's teaching her to grow 
 With a careful cover of love that will not fail 
 And the God of second chance 
 Picked her up and He let her dance 
 Through a world that is not kind 
 And all this time, preparing her the one 
 To hold her up when she comes undone 
 Beneath the storm, beneath the sun 
 And grown up tall, here you are 
 Your day has come 
 Beneath the air of autumn, she took him by the hand 
 And warm beneath the ardor, she took his heart instead 
 And high upon the mountain, he asked her for her hand 
 Just for her hand 
 A page is turned in this life, he's making her his wife 
 And there is no secret to the source of this much life 
 When the grace falls like rain is washing them again 
 Just a chance to somehow rise above this land 
 Where the God of second chance 
 Will pick them up and He'll let them dance 
 Through a world that is not kind 
 And all this time, they're sharing with the one 
 That holds them up when they come undone 
 Beneath the sotrm, beneath the sun 
 And once again, here you stand 
 And once again, here you stand 
 Your day has come

I believe when they put her in the ground 
 I think they buried part of me 
 'Cause I've been searching 
 I've been looking all around 
 But I cannot find the heart of me 
 The heart of me 
 So I put my fingers in this soil upon her grave 
 And I will plant for her a garden 
 And every flower a reminder of her face 
 Will grow up graceful as a pardon 
 And all that grows is her story told 
 As life unfolds here before us 
 The peace I've found in this broken ground 
 I can see her in the harvest 
 Of all that I have sown 
 And long before I was covered up in grey 
 Before the old had bent my bones 
 We grow our children in the red Georgia clay 
 They were our garden and our home 
 And that grows is our story told 
 As life unfolds here before us 
 The peace we've found in that broken ground 
 I can see them in the harvest 
 Of all that I have sown 
 And when my life is done 
 I pray the kingdom come 
 Take me to glory 
 And it's living inside me 
 It was planted like a seed 
 All to tell a story 
 And I believe when they put me in the ground 
 There will remain a part of me 
 'Cause I've been searching 
 And the joy that I have found 
 Is living in my family 
 It's all that I have sown 
 It's all that I have sown

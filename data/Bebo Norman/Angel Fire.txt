Quietly slipping away are the fertile ties 
 That have bound us. 
 Behind its subtle ways you know this world 
 Can hide and surround us. 
 And living in a lonely room beneath the 
 Tomb oh, of another sky 
 They tell me that it's a shame not a word 
 Was spoken as the bottom line was broken, 
 But it's coming back again. 
 And after all this time 
 The stillness still can shake me 
 To the corners of my mind 
 Where the Angel Fire 
 Oh, the Angel Fire shines. 
 She held me like the rest and wore her 
 Summer dress so full of flowers. 
 And just as if to stay we loved along the 
 Way but the time was not ours. 
 And standing there beneath the sun 
 I watched the river run 
 Oh, as the kids float by. 
 It was a father and a son who made a simple 
 Turning into a permanent good-bye, 
 But let's give it one more try. 
 And after all this time 
 The stillness still can shake me 
 To the corners of my mind 
 Where the Angel Fire 
 Oh, the Angel Fire shines. 
 Well, she held us in her morning 
 This one last time and we will be gone. 
 And looking up we watched the angels 
 Paint the sky. 
 And with the passion of a picture 
 We made our silent ride down 
 Just happy with this portion of our lives 
 And after all this time 
 The stillness still can shake me 
 To the corners of my mind 
 Where the Angel Fire, 
 Oh, the Angel Fire shines.

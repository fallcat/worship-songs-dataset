Oh my love, don't you cry 
 I won't leave you alone tonight 
 So put your hand back into mine 
 And I will hold you until the end of time 
 I hung my hope on your return 
 Now all that sorrow so soon will burn 
 So tend my heart with tender hands 
 And see your sunshine pouring in 
 All the world is at my feet 
 Cause you came sailing back to me 
 So look around you and look outside 
 A great big love and the big blue sky 
 And all the spring, and all this light 
 And all these treetops... well, they're all mine

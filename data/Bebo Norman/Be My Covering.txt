The sun gives to a darkened sky 
 Blood red are the tears we cry 
 So far from Your design 
 Oh God, hear me tonight 
 Though the waters rise 
 They will not pull me under 
 When the mountain slides 
 And crashes to the sea 
 I will lift my eyes 
 And call out to You, Father 
 Be my covering 
 War-torn are the rags of every nation 
 Fear lives in the heart of every home 
 Louder than the groans of creation 
 Oh, my God, be the voice of hope

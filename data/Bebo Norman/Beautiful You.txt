I can't stand the sound 
 Of losing control 
 But whenever you're around 
 I can't find the breath to speak at all 
 I need you to be careful with me... 
 Please don't go away 
 Please don't leave me here 
 I know if you don't stay 
 My heart will disappear... I need beautiful you 
 Your love brings me in 
 And swallows me whole 
 But underneath your skin 
 Is the only peace I know 
 All that I need is you here with me... 
 Please don't go away 
 Please don't leave me here 
 I know if you don't stay 
 My heart will disappear 
 This world will disappear... I need beautiful you

I don't have a lot to give 
 This broken world can make it hard to live 
 I got nothing left to say 
 My empty words have simply gone away 
 But this big blue sky 
 Shows me all that I have got 
 And you're by my side 
 To be everything I'm not 
 The angels sigh 
 I breathe deep the breath of God 
 I cannot find another sky 
 My thoughts are heavy and they cloud my eyes 
 But when I'm searching for the sun 
 You rise up quickly with your kingdom come 
 I'm coming alive 
 Nothing is good apart from you 
 I'm coming alive... with you 
 I may not have a lot to give 
 This broken world can make it hard to live 
 I may have nothing left to say 
 But I know that you will never go away

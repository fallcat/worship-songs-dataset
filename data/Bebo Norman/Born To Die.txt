They never knew a dark night 
 Always had the Son's light 
 On their face 
 Perfect in glory 
 Broken by the story 
 Of untold grace... 
 Come that day 
 Majesty had come down 
 Glory had succumbed now 
 To the flesh and bone 
 In the arms of a manger 
 In the hands of strangers 
 That could not know 
 Just who they hold 
 And the angels filled the sky 
 All of heaven wondered why 
 Why their King would choose to be 
 Be a baby born to die 
 And all fell silent 
 For the cry of an infant, 
 The voice of God 
 Was dividing history 
 For those with eyes to see, 
 The Son would shine 
 From earth that night 
 And the angels filled the sky 
 All of heaven wondered why 
 Why their King would choose to be 
 Be a baby born to die 
 To break the chains 
 Of guilt and sin 
 To find us here 
 To pull us in 
 So we can join in Heaven's song 
 And with one voice around the throne 
 And the angels filled the sky 
 All of heaven wondered why 
 Why their King would choose to be 
 Be a baby born to die 
 All the angels filled the sky 
 And I can't help but wonder why 
 Why this King would choose to be 
 Be a baby born for me 
 Be a baby born 
 Be a baby born to die

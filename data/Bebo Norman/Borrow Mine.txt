Take my hand 
 And walk with me awhile 
 Because it seems your smile 
 Has left here 
 And don't give in 
 When you fall apart 
 And your broken heart 
 Has failed you 
 I'll set a light up 
 On a hilltop 
 To show you my love 
 For this world to see 
 You can borrow mine 
 When your hope is gone 
 You can borrow mine 
 When you can't go on 
 Cause the world will not defeat you 
 If we're side by side 
 When your faith is hard to find 
 You can borrow mine 
 You can borrow mine 
 And take my love 
 And all that you can see 
 Is the raging sea 
 All around us 
 And don't give up 
 'Cause I'm not letting go 
 And the God we know 
 Will not fail us 
 We will lay it all down 
 As we call out 
 Sweet Savior 
 Help our unbelief 
 You can borrow mine 
 When your hope is gone 
 You can borrow mine 
 When you can't go on 
 Cause the world will not defeat you 
 If we're side by side 
 When your faith is hard to find 
 You can borrow mine 
 You can borrow mine 
 When you are weak 
 Unable to speak 
 You are not alone 
 God of us, save us 
 And never forsake us 
 Is coming to take us 
 And take us to our home 
 You can borrow mine 
 When your hope is gone 
 You can borrow mine 
 When you can't go on 
 Cause the world will not defeat you 
 If we're side by side 
 When your faith is hard to find 
 When your faith is hard to find 
 You can borrow mine 
 You can borrow mine 
 Take my hand 
 Take my love 
 Don't give in, no 
 And don't give up

Today I woke up early, today I woke up sad 
 It's funny how it hurts me, the love I've never had 
 But I can feel you breaking me through this mess 
 I can feel you through this loneliness 
 Show me that 
 Life shines with you 
 You show me that 
 Life shines with you 
 Break me through 
 I think that I can hear it 
 Is it a trumpet or a train 
 And now I'm drawing near it 
 And it's calling out my name 
 I got nothing to lose 
 I got nothing to prove in this mess 
 There's nothing to lose 
 But all this emptiness 
 If I had a ladder 
 To reach up to the sky 
 I would climb up there forever 
 It would just be you and I 
 And I would feel you 
 Breaking me through this mess 
 I would feel you 
 Through this loneliness

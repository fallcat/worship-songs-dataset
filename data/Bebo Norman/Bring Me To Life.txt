I am a barren land 
 And it's all I can do to stand 
 I am thirsty, I am thirsty 
 Father, reach out Your hand 
 I have given all that I can 
 Still I'm sinking, I'm still sinking 
 I want to run into the deep 
 And let the deep call out to me 
 I want to lose myself in Your love 
 So let it rain down over me 
 As I fall down to my knees 
 Let the ocean rise to meet me 
 I need You to bring me to life 
 Well of eternal things 
 Endless is all the life You bring 
 Be the water that I long for 
 And show me Your Kingdom Come 
 Father and let Your will be done 
 Here in me as it is in Heaven

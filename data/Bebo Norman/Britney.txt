Britney, I'm sorry for the lies we told 
 We took you into our arms, then left you cold 
 Britney, I'm sorry for this cruel, cruel world 
 We sell the beauty but destroy the girl 
 Britney, I'm sorry for your broken heart 
 We stood aside and watched you fall apart 
 I'm sorry we told you fame would fill you up 
 And money moves the man, so drink the cup 
 I know love goes around the world we know 
 And you never see it coming back 
 You never see it coming back 
 I know love goes around the world we know 
 And you never see it coming back 
 But I can see it coming back for you 
 Yes, coming back for you 
 Britney, I'm sorry for the stones we throw 
 We tear you down just so we can watch the show 
 Britney, I'm sorry for the words we say 
 We point the finger as you fall from grace 
 I know love goes around the world we know 
 And you never see it coming back 
 You never see it coming back 
 And I know love goes around the world we know 
 And you never see it coming back 
 But I can see it coming back for you 
 Yeah, it's coming back for you 
 Yeah, it's coming back for you 
 Yeah, it's coming back for you, yeah 
 Britney, I do believe that love has come 
 Here for the broken 
 Here for the ones like us 
 I know love goes around the world we know 
 And you never see it coming back 
 You never see it coming back 
 And I know love goes around the world we know 
 And you never see it coming back 
 But I can see it coming back 
 I know love goes around the world we know 
 And you never see it coming back 
 But I can see it coming back for you 
 Yeah, it's coming back for you 
 (I can see it coming back) 
 Yeah, it's coming back for you 
 (I can see it coming back) 
 Yeah, it's coming back for you, yeah 
 (I can see it coming back) 
 I can see it coming back 
 I can see it coming back

You found me here 
 I'm barely breathing 
 You picked me up 
 But I'm still wanting more 
 You're the ocean deep 
 I'm in up to my knees 
 Wanting desperately to drown 
 You're the one bright part 
 Of my languid heart 
 You're the love 
 I cannot live without 
 I cannot live without 
 Please hold me close 
 I can't stop shaking 
 It's not for fear 
 My walls are breaking down 
 You're the ocean deep 
 I'm in up to my knees 
 Wanting desperately to drown 
 You're the one bright part 
 Of my languid heart 
 You're the love 
 I cannot live without 
 I can't live without 
 I can't live without You 
 I can't live without You 
 And I cannot live without You, oh 
 Can You hold on? 
 Can You hold on? 
 Can You hold on to me? 
 Because You hold everything, yeah 
 You're the ocean deep 
 I'm in up to my knees 
 Wanting desperately to drown 
 You're the one bright part 
 Of my languid heart 
 You're the love 
 I cannot live without 
 I can't live without You 
 I can't live without You

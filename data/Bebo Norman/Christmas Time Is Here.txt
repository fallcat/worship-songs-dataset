The days are getting cold 
 It's warm inside our homes 
 Family drawing near 
 Christmas time is here 
 So I'll say "Merry Christmas" 
 I'll wish peace to you 
 I'll hope for the hopeless, your dreams come true 
 And I'll pray for the laughter 
 I'll sing through the tears 
 I'll say Merry Christmas for all the world to hear 
 The smell of evergreen 
 A wooden manger scene 
 A starry night so clear 
 Christmas time is here 
 So I'll say "Merry Christmas" 
 I'll wish peace to you 
 I'll hope for the hopeless, your dreams come true 
 And I'll pray for the laughter 
 I'll sing through the tears 
 I'll say Merry Christmas for all the world to hear 
 So for a moment now 
 Let's lay our weapons down 
 When our walls disappear 
 Christmas time is here 
 So I'll say "Merry Christmas" 
 I'll wish peace to you 
 I'll hope for the hopeless, your dreams come true 
 And I'll pray for the laughter 
 I'll sing through the tears 
 I'll say Merry Christmas for all the world to hear 
 So I'll say "Merry Christmas" 
 I'll wish peace to you 
 I'll hope for the hopeless, your dreams come true 
 And I'll pray for the laughter 
 I'll sing through the tears 
 I'll say Merry Christmas for all the world to hear

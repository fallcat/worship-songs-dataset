Angels, from the realms of glory 
 Wing your flight o'er all the earth 
 Ye who sang creation's story 
 Now proclaim Messiah's birth: 
 Come and worship 
 Christ the newborn King 
 Come and worship 
 Worship Christ, the newborn King 
 Shepherds, in the field abiding 
 Watching o'er your flocks at night 
 God with man is now residing 
 Yonder shines the infant Light: 
 Come and worship 
 Come and worship 
 Christ, the newborn King 
 Come and worship 
 Worship Christ, the newborn King

Could you ever look me the way you're looking at the ocean 
 All wounded in your smile, but holy and unriled 
 Could you ever look at me? 
 Could you ever look at me the way your looking at the sunrise? 
 How it settles on your face, whole and unafraid 
 Like the light of your world 
 And I don't know how to chase away the fear I have inside me 
 And I don't know where it is you go when you drift away, when you drift away 
 Could you ever look at me the way you looking at the ocean 
 Could you give me that smile, if only for a while? 
 Could you ever look at me? 
 I don't know how to find a way to keep you here beside me 
 And I don't know where it is you go 
 But its beautiful to me, so beautiful to see 
 I hope you never look at me, the way you're looking at the ocean 
 Cause in the sunrise I have seen I was never meant to be The light of your world

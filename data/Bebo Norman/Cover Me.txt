Cover me, cover up my tears 
 Cover up this man who's covered up in fear 
 I need a peace of mind, I need a piece of you 
 TO cover all that's gone and everything that's new 
 You unveil me with your mercy 
 I want to breathe you in 
 You unfold me, then you hold me 
 Cover up my heart, cover up my soul 
 Cover up this world and everything I know 
 You cover up the sky, you cover up the sea 
 Cover up the mountains and every part of me 
 Everything single breath I breathe... cover me 
 I am still alive and covered up in years 
 Covered up in lines as innocence appears 
 So give me a peace of mind, give me a piece of you 
 To cover all that's old with everything that's new 
 You unveil me with your mercy 
 I want to breathe you in 
 And you unfold me, then you hold me 
 You unveil me with your mercy 
 I want to breathe you in 
 You unfold me then you hold me 
 I want to shed this skin 
 You unveil me with your mercy 
 You unfold me, then you hold me 
 You unbreak me, would you take me home

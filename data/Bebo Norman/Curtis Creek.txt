We planned to leave early 
 And to pack unheavy 
 Because the truck was getting full. 
 But the same old fear 
 At the end of the year 
 Wouldn't let us leave so soon. 
 The Blue Ridge Mountains were calling, 
 The rain was falling, 
 The wind was in our faces. 
 And above the sound 
 Of the engine I found us 
 Arriving at those places. 
 I've heard you say a 
 Thousand times 
 That we could never leave 
 This town, 
 But where were you last night 
 When the sun went down. 
 The rain proved steady 
 And as our packs wore heavy 
 With the weight of our survival. 
 The woods rang loud 
 With the love of our God 
 And the sound of our revival. 
 The summer wind turned colder 
 As the day grew older, 
 The night would soon surround us. 
 The Curtis Falls 
 Had a view of it all 
 As the snow fell all around us. 
 I've heard you say a 
 Thousand times 
 That we could never leave 
 This town, 
 But where were you last night 
 When the sun went down. 
 I was singing alone, 
 You were standing on the side. 
 And the water so warm 
 As you walked the mountain side, 
 And you washed my feet and cried. 
 Well, the days passed quickly 
 And our time was over 
 Three souls the same in sorrow. 
 But the Reds and rain 
 Put an intimate stain 
 On the start of our tomorrow. 
 And soon our pieces will scatter 
 In a world of anger, 
 The only thing to free us 
 Is the part of man 
 That we don't understand 
 That found a place between us. 
 I've heard you say a 
 Thousand times 
 That we could never leave 
 This town, 
 But where were you last night 
 When the sun went down.

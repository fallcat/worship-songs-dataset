She turned her head as if to hide; 
 There was just nowhere to go. 
 'Cause standing tall on every side 
 The mighty fear of letting go 
 She said, "My God, I'm so ashamed. 
 Thirty years; a tragedy. 
 I still believed that he could change. 
 But he pulled me down, like gravity. 
 He broke my will, but it's deeper still... 
 ...Deeper still." 
 She told me morning was the time 
 When the sun burned bright and clean 
 And love grew fragile on the vine, 
 All wrapped up in gold and green. 
 "Because after all, we know we all 
 Are after all the same things. 
 But for the sun no rain would fall; 
 And it burned him up and turned him mean. 
 This fire that kills me, it's deeper still... 
 ...Deeper still." 
 Tonight I rose up with the moon, 
 And looking down from high above 
 I saw a world carved and confused 
 Into valleys deep in need of love. 
 And falling down all thick with grace, 
 Heaven's cloud of mystery 
 Was filling every empty space, 
 Down to the depth of human need 
 (Love that heals me, love that heals me) 
 This love that heals, it's deeper still 
 (Love that's deeper still) 
 (Love that heals me, love that heals me) 
 This love that heals, it's deeper still... 
 (Love that's deeper still) 
 ...It's deeper still

On a day like this I want to crawl beneath a rock 
 A million miles from the world, the noise, the commotion 
 That never seems to stop 
 And on a day like this I want to run away from the routine 
 Run away from the daily grind that can suck the life 
 Right out of me 
 I know of only one place I can run to 
 I want to hide in You 
 The Way, the Life, the Truth 
 So I can disappear 
 And love is all there is to see 
 Coming out of me 
 And You become clear 
 As I disappear 
 I don't want to care about earthly things 
 Be caught up in all the lies that trick my eyes 
 They say it's all about me 
 I'm so tired of it being about me 
 I would rather be cast away 
 Separated from the human race 
 If I don't bring You glory 
 If I don't bring You glory 
 If I don't bring You glory

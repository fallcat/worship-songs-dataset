Sometimes when I'm all alone 
 I don't know if I can 
 Take another breath 
 Some say home is where the heart is 
 Tell me where my home is 
 'Cause I am scared to death 
 Falling from a rooftop 
 Crashing like a raindrop 
 Can you make my heart stop 
 Shaking like a leaf? 
 Standing at the floodgate 
 Steady as an earthquake 
 Can you hear my heart break 
 Tearing at the seems? 
 I am drifting in my deep end 
 Holding on to your hand 
 Is all that saves me now 
 Life can treat you like a beggar 
 You hold me together 
 But I don't know how 
 Falling from a rooftop 
 Crashing like a raindrop 
 Can you make my heart stop 
 Shaking like a leaf? 
 Standing at the floodgate 
 Steady as an earthquake 
 Can you hear my heart break 
 Tearing at the seems? 
 Some say home is where the heart is 
 And my heart is in your hands 
 You are all I need 
 Rising from the ashes 
 Lifted from the madness 
 Now you see my heart is 
 Deep enough to dream 
 Hear me from my deathblow 
 Lead and I will follow 
 Now you feel my heart pull 
 Mending at the seams 
 Rising from the ashes 
 Lifted from the madness 
 Now you see my heart is 
 Deep enough to dream 
 Hear me from my deathblow 
 Lead and I will follow 
 Now you feel my heart pull 
 Mending at the seams'

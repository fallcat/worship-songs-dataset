Take me to the desert 
 You will be the water 
 I will drink forever to fill my soul 
 Lead me through the fire of darkness and desire 
 You will be my shelter, You will be my shelter 
 I'll find you there, I'll find you there 
 It's here that I call out 
 It's here that I fall down 
 It's here that I found out 
 That you are everything I hoped You'd be 
 Take me to the river 
 Lead me to the healer 
 Let it wash me over, oh my soul 
 Take me to the mountain 
 Lead me to the altar 
 We will build together 
 And I will remember 
 I found you there, I found you there... 
 It's here that I call out 
 It's here that I fall down 
 It's here that I find out 
 That you are everything 
 It's here that I call out 
 It's here that I fall down 
 It's here that I find out 
 That you are everything I hoped You'd be 
 I hoped You'd be the sun that always shines 
 I hoped You'd be the everylasting life 
 It's here that I call out 
 It's here that I fall down 
 It's here that I found out 
 That you are everything 
 It's here that I call out 
 It's here that I fall down 
 It's here that I found out 
 That you are everything I hoped You'd be 
 I hoped You'd be 
 I hoped You'd be 
 I hoped You'd be

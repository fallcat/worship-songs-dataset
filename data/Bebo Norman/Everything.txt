When day is over 
 I'll be the color in the sky 
 If darkness lingers 
 I'll be the flame that gives you light 
 I just want you to notice 
 I just want you to feel the same 
 I just want you to notice 
 That I just want to be your everything 
 I just want to be your everything 
 On my shoulder 
 There is a place for you to cry 
 I'll be your shelter 
 When there is nowhere left to hide 
 Sometimes I see you cry 
 When you watch the sun go down 
 You're magical, so beautiful, and I... 
 When day is over 
 I'll be the color in the sky

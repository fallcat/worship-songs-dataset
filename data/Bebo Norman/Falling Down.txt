Angels on a subway 
 She's buried in a magazine 
 Stuck inside a replay 
 Of someone else's dream 
 Prophets made of paper 
 Don't tell her anything 
 She wants something just to save her 
 So she lifts her head and screams 
 She lifts her head and screams, 
 "I don't know you 
 But I love you anyway 
 I can't see you 
 But I hope you're here to stay 
 I don't know you 
 But I need you here with me 
 'Cause I'm falling down 
 I'm falling down" 
 Now angels on a runway 
 Looking for a big jet plane 
 To take her to a new day 
 She won't be back again 
 She won't be back again 
 And she says, 
 "I don't know you 
 But I love you anyway 
 I can't see you 
 But I hope you're here to stay 
 I don't know you 
 But I need you here with me 
 'Cause I'm falling down 
 I'm falling down" 
 You're on my side 
 You're just in time 
 I'm on my way 
 Don't know who you are 
 But I want you back again 
 "I don't know you 
 But I love you anyway 
 I can't see you 
 But I hope you're here to stay 
 I don't know you 
 But I need you here with me 
 'Cause I'm falling down 
 I'm falling down"

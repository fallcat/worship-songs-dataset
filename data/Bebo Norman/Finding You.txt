Everything is all right, everything is so bright 
 And the sun is shining beautiful 
 Everyone is singing, everyone is dreaming 
 Every world is so colorful 
 And you look back at me 
 You know it makes me say 
 I'm finding you in everything that shines 
 I'm finding you in between the lines 
 I'm finding you 
 You open up my eyes every time 
 'Cause your love is so alive 
 Maybe you could stop time, hanging onto daylight 
 Doesn't ever have to go away 
 I could sing a new song, maybe get the words wrong 
 But you know just what I want to say 
 'Cause when you look at me 
 You know I still believe 
 I'm finding you in everything that shines 
 I'm finding you in between the lines 
 I'm finding you 
 You open up my eyes every time 
 'Cause your love is so alive 
 When broken things are given wings they fly away 
 You make me say 
 Everything is all right, everything is so bright 
 Yeah your love is shining beautiful 
 Everyone is singing everyone is dreaming 
 I'm feeling so alive 
 I'm finding you in everything that shines 
 I'm finding you in between the lines 
 I'm finding you 
 You open up my eyes every time 
 'Cause your love is so alive

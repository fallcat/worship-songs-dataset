Go, tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 While shepherds kept their watching 
 O'er silent flocks by night, 
 Behold throughout the heavens 
 There shone a holy light. 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 The shepherds feared and trembled 
 When lo! above the earth 
 Rang out the angel chorus 
 That hailed our Savior's birth. 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 Down in a lowly manger 
 The humble Christ was born, 
 And God sent us salvation 
 That blessed Christmas morn.

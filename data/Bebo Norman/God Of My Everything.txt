Oh God of Heaven come and hem me in 
 Gather the pieces that are broken 
 Show me the wonder of You again 
 Oh God of Heaven 
 God of my hope, God of my need 
 God of my pain that no one else will ever see 
 God of my healing, God of my strength 
 God who has always and will forever reign 
 God of my everything 
 In all creation You call my name 
 In all the beauty that this world displays 
 Still I'm the one for who Your heart aches 
 In all creation 
 God of my hope, God of my need 
 God of my pain that no one else will ever see 
 God of my healing, God of my strength 
 God who has always and will forever reign 
 God of my everything 
 God of my everything 
 And when the mountains shake 
 You are my God 
 You never change 
 And when the earth gives way 
 You are still God 
 You never change 
 God of my hope, God of my need 
 God of my pain that no one else will ever see 
 God of my healing, God of my strength 
 God who has always and will forever reign 
 God of my everything 
 God of my everything 
 God of my everything 
 God of my everything

Sometimes at night 
 I am afraid 
 I cover my eyes 
 Cover my shame 
 So here in the dark 
 Broken apart 
 Come with Your light 
 And fill up my soul 
 I'm half a man here 
 So come make me whole 
 Oh, great Light of the World 
 Come to impart 
 The Light of Your grace 
 To fill up my heart 
 The wind of this world 
 Can push us around 
 Folding us up 
 Backing us down 
 But here in the dark 
 I'm not alone 
 So come with Your strength 
 And carry me home 
 Oh, great Light of the World 
 Fill up my soul 
 I'm half a man here 
 So come make me whole 
 Oh, great Light of the World 
 Come to impart 
 The light of Your grace 
 Oh great Light of the World 
 Fill up my soul 
 I'm half a man here 
 So come make me whole 
 Oh, great Light of the World 
 Come to impart 
 The light of Your grace 
 To Fill up my heart 
 The light of Your grace 
 To fill up my heart

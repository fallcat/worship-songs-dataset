I can tell by this crack of light 
 Oh girl this is gonna be, it's gonna be a beautiful day 
 And I can tell by this stretch of silver 
 Spreading all out across the curves of your face 
 And for the love, for the love of God 
 I've gathered up my pride, I've gathered up my bits and bone 
 And in a world that broke me down 
 I'm standing up, but not alone 
 'Cause this is a healing song, oh and I've got a heart that fails 
 But love is pushing me along, I'm lifting up above this veil 
 This is a healing song, oh and I don't know if you can tell 
 But love is pushing me along 
 I'm pressing up against the rail, pressing up against the rail 
 I can smell the summer in the air 
 And I swear I can almost see, I can almost see my soul 
 Son, I know that it don't seem fair 
 But I'm turning away from here, and oh Lord, I am coming home 
 I've got friends here that love me 
 I've got all this mercy beating in my blood 
 And I've got friends here that love me 
 And that's something good, that's something good 
 You and I, we've come so far 
 We've come so far, we cannot look back 
 I said you and I, we've come so far 
 We've come so far, we cannot look back 
 I said you and I (you and I, we've come so far) 
 We've come so far (you and I, we've come so far) 
 We've come so far (you and I, we've come so far) 
 We cannot look back (you and I cannot look back) 
 I said you and I (you and I, we've come so far) 
 We've come so far (you and I, we've come so far) 
 We've come so far (you and I, we've come so far) 
 No, we cannot look back (we cannot look back)

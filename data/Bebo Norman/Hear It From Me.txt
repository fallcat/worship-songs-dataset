A love song, You must have heard a thousand times 
 How can mine compare? 
 For so long, I've wondered if I'm lost behind 
 A thousand tongues there, a thousand tongues there 
 It's all been done before, but I'll do it again 
 'Cause I know that You want me to 
 It's all been said before, but I'll say it again 
 'Cause I know that You love to hear it from me 
 I see all the ways I don't add up 
 And all that I never did 
 But You seek empty hands still lifted up 
 With nothing to give, nothing to give 
 It's all been done before, but I'll do it again 
 'Cause I know that You want me to 
 It's all been said before, but I'll say it again 
 'Cause I know that You love to hear it from me 
 More beautiful to You 
 Than the songs of angels and gifts of kings 
 More beautiful to You 
 Are what empty hands can bring 
 And what desperate tongues can sing 
 And when broken hearts cling to You 
 It's all been done before, but I'll do it again 
 'Cause I know that You want, You want me to 
 It's all been done before, but I'll do it again 
 'Cause I know that You want me to 
 It's all been said before, but I'll say it again 
 'Cause I know that You love to hear it from me 
 So hear it from me, so hear it from me 
 So hear it from me

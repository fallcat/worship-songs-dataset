Never got anywhere by running away 
 Never learned anything without a mistake 
 Never loved anyone by playing it safe 
 It's a long way down, but I'm here right now... so 
 Here goes nothing, here goes everything 
 Gotta reach for something or you'll fall for anything 
 Take a breath, take a step, what comes next God only knows 
 But here goes 
 I don't wanna turn around and wonder what happened 
 Never lost and never found are one in the same 
 I wanna run across the battle lines and take my chances 
 Not the long way 'round when I'm here right now... so 
 Here goes nothing, here goes everything 
 Gotta reach for something or you'll fall for anything 
 Take a breath, take a step, what comes next God only knows 
 But here goes 
 What good is chance not taken? 
 What good is life not living? 
 What good is love not given? 
 Here goes nothing, here goes everything 
 Gotta reach for something or you'll fall for anything 
 Here goes nothing, here goes everything 
 Gotta reach for something or you'll fall for anything 
 Take a breath, take a step, what comes next God only knows 
 But here goes 
 God only knows 
 But here goes

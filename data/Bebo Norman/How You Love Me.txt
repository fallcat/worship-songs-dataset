Hope came home 
 Home to me today 
 And fear has run the other way 
 And words are weak 
 You don't know how to say 
 You know I still believe in you 
 And should my dreams fall though 
 I will be safe with you 
 And with every breath I can breathe 
 I'll sing about how you love me 
 I'll sing about how you love me

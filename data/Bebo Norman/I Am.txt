Come along, I'll walk you through the world 
 And we will sing a different song 
 All along you have unfurled 
 But I will hold you from now on 
 I saw the day when you had lost your way 
 I saw the sun sinking low 
 I saw the night, remember how you cried 
 But don't you know you're not alone 
 No, you're not alone 
 I am in the sun, I am in the shade 
 I am in the light that love has made 
 I am in the cold, I am in the warm 
 I am in the center of your storm 
 I am in the fire, I am in the flood 
 I am in the marrow and the blood 
 When you cannot stand... I am 
 Come with me, I'll take you to the sea 
 And it will be all beautiful 
 And all the water that covers everything 
 Cannot compare to my love 
 FOr you my love 
 I am in the sun, I am in the shade 
 I am in the light that love has made 
 I am in the cold, I am in the warm 
 I am in the center of your storm 
 I am in the fire, I am in the flood 
 I am in the marrow and the blood 
 When you cannot stand... I am 
 WHen the light won't come 
 When your breath is gone 
 WHen your hope is done 
 Just look at me, look at me 
 I am in the sun, I am in the shade 
 I am in the light that love has made 
 I am in the cold, I am in the warm 
 I am in the center of your storm 
 I am in the fire, I am in the flood 
 I am in the marrow and the blood 
 When you cannot stand... I am

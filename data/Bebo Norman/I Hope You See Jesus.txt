Instead of fear, instead of blinded eyes 
 Instead of shame, instead of all my lies 
 Instead of an orphan without a name 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 Instead of anger, instead of unbelief 
 Instead of weakness in the heart of me 
 Instead of a wounded soul that sometimes loses faith 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 Standing in my place 
 Bearing all my shame 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 Instead of voices in a faceless crowd 
 Instead of prophets crying out from behind a shroud 
 Instead of fingers pointing out the blame 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 I hope you see love, I hope you see love, I hope you see love 
 Oh my God, when you look on us 
 A broken people who have turned from love 
 Instead of the words we throw and the wars we wage 
 I hope you forgive us 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 I hope you see Jesus 
 Standing in our place 
 Bearing all our shame 
 I hope you see Jesus

I took a walk down to the river 
 A broken heart in my hands 
 Before the Taker and the Giver 
 To make my final stand 
 I waded out into the water 
 And I sank just like a stone 
 But I was lifted by the Angel 
 To never be alone 
 And I never knew 
 I could lay my burdens down 
 And I never knew 
 Redemption could be found 
 But I know now 
 I saw Your mercy in the morning 
 In the color of the sky 
 I let the Spirit wash me over 
 And the sun began to rise 
 I took a walk down to the river 
 And I laid my burdens down 
 Before the Taker and the Giver 
 And I am finally found

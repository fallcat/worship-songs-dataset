God, my God, I cry out 
 Your beloved needs You now 
 God, be near, calm my fear 
 And take my doubt 
 Your kindness is what pulls me up 
 Your love is all that draws me in 
 I will lift my eyes to the Maker 
 Of the mountains I can't climb 
 I will lift my eyes to the Calmer 
 Of the oceans raging wild 
 I will lift my eyes to the Healer 
 Of the hurt I hold inside 
 I will lift my eyes, lift my eyes to You 
 God, my God, let Mercy sing 
 Her melody over me 
 God, right here all I bring 
 Is all of me 
 'Cause You are and You were and You will be forever 
 The Lover I need to save me 
 'Cause You fashioned the earth and You hold it together, God 
 So hold me now

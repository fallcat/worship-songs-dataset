I got a little hope in my pocket 
 I want to share of it with you 
 Just be careful that you don't drop it 
 Don't worry if you do 
 'Cause I've got broken down inside me 
 And I might just need some help 
 But I will get by 
 Hey, hey 
 And I've got demons in my history 
 Got bone beneath my skin 
 I've been taken by a mystery 
 Yes I've been taken in 
 And sometimes voices down inside me 
 Try to fight me for myself 
 I will get by 
 Hey, hey 
 What have I got to live for 
 If there is nothing beating in my chest 
 And what have I got to live for 
 When this world starts turning 
 It's burning me up 
 I'm all right 
 I used to think love was just a barter 
 Second hand coincidence 
 What doesn't kill you just makes you harder 
 So I use my common sense 
 Keeping cold to keep my distance 
 Till you took my pride away 
 Now I will get by 
 Yeah, yeah 
 'Cause what have I got to live for 
 There is nothing beating in my chest 
 And what have I got to live for 
 When this world starts turning 
 It's burning me up 
 I'm all right 
 But I am not afraid 
 No I am not afraid 
 And I will not go crazy 
 I got a little hope here in my pocket 
 Want to share of it with you 
 Just be careful that you don't drop it 
 Don't worry if you do 
 'Cause I've got voices down inside me 
 And I might just need some help 
 I will get by 
 Hey, hey 
 What have I got to live for 
 There's nothing beating in my chest 
 And what have I got to live for 
 When this world starts turning 
 Burning me up 
 When my heart is hurting 
 I'm learning about love 
 When this world starts turning 
 It's burning me up 
 I'm all right

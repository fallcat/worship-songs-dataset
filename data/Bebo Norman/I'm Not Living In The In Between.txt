Can I come close to you? 
 Hold your heart and never move 
 I'll never move 
 Well, I can't be anything I'm not 
 You get what you see 
 But I'm gonna give you everything I got 
 I'm not living in the in-between 
 I'm not living in the in-between 
 Can I walk right next to you? 
 And never stop, I'll be the proof 
 I'll be the proof 
 Well, I can't be anything I'm not 
 You get what you see 
 But I'm gonna give you everything I got 
 I'm not living in the in-between 
 I'm not living in the in-between 
 Look up, look up, it's like 
 The sky is falling down on us, on us 
 Wake up, wake up, it's just 
 This dream I have, it's made for us, for us 
 Whoa oh yeah, whoa oh yeah, yeah 
 Well, I can't be anything I'm not 
 You get what you see 
 But I'm gonna give you everything I got 
 I'm not living in the in-between 
 No, I can't be anything I'm not 
 You get what you see 
 But I'm gonna give you everything I got 
 I'm not living in the in-between 
 I'm not living in the in-between

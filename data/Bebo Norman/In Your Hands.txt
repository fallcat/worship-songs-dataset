I didn't know 
 How I'd love you 
 When I walked into your life 
 Now I have a heart I cannot keep 
 And the greatest of fear 
 Is that you'll leave me here 
 Stranded in this water 
 So deep 
 So don't you turn away from me 
 Because my heart and my hold 
 Are in your hands 
 If I don't seem certain 
 It's just a common fear 
 From a common man 
 But I'm in your hands 
 Just so you know 
 I have never done this sort of thing before 
 I've never given up my very soul 
 But I have heard a voice 
 Like none I've heard before 
 And it's a voice that never grows old 
 So don't you turn from me 
 Because my heart and my hopes 
 Are in your hands 
 If I don't seem certain 
 It's just a common fear 
 From a common man 
 But I'm in your hands 
 So don't you turn away from me 
 Because my heart and my hopes 
 Are in your hands 
 And If I don't seem certain 
 It's just a common fear 
 From a common man 
 But I'm in your hands 
 I'm in your hands 
 I know 
 I'm in your hands

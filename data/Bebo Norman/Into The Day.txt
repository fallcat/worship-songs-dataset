You could turn a hundred years and never empty all your fears 
 They're pouring out like broken words and broken bones 
 They could fill a thousand pages, be the cry for all the ages 
 And the song for every soul who stands alone 
 The ache of life is more than you are able 
 Hold on love, don't give up 
 Don't close your eyes 
 The light is breaking through the night 
 Step out into the day, all the clouds and all the rain are gone 
 It's over now 
 Step out into the sun, for you have only begun to know 
 What it's all about 
 As the hungering dark gives way to the dawn, my love 
 It's over now 
 Time will let the story told grow and grow 'til it unfolds 
 In a way that even you cannot ignore 
 You can say the seasons change but never if you just remain 
 In a place where the freeze is at your door 
 What you don't know is the signs are right for the turning tide 
 Hold on, hold on 
 It won't be long 
 So hold on

I would give my soul just to look at you 
 And everything I know just to see it through 
 To let all the others fade away 
 And turn all my darkness into day 
 My love, I would give my soul just to look at you 
 Would you believe in me 
 Or would you walk away in need 
 Would you believe in me 
 Or would you turn away and leave 
 Either way, my love... 
 I would give my soul just to look at you 
 If you found my heart would you run it dry 
 And break it all apart just to run and hide 
 And make all the colors fade away 
 Into another shade of gray 
 My love, I'd still give my soul just to look at you 
 Would you believe in me 
 Or would you walk away in need 
 'Cause I don't know where, and I don't know how 
 But I just want to see you now 
 So would you believe in me 
 Or would you turn away and leave 
 Either way, my love... 
 I would give my soul just to look at you

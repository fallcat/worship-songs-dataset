Well even in the light of day 
 We somehow slipped away 
 Into the city down by the lake. 
 And just beyond the crowded streets 
 We found a place to meet 
 Where the grass was greener. 
 And how we did sing beneath our God. 
 And the measure of that place 
 Was the pleasure on your face 
 As the music starts to rise 
 And the sun did fall. 
 But when the melody was young 
 Until the singers all were sung 
 The Maker of the skies, 
 Well He just smiled on. 
 And the move was fine... 
 Beneath the mountain city walls 
 It was a picture of us all 
 And our hearts were laughing 
 As the band did play 
 Until the music took our feet 
 To the motion of the street, 
 This grass was bluer 
 And how we did dance 
 On the yellow lines. 
 And the measure of that place 
 Was the pleasure on your face 
 As the music starts to rise 
 And the sun did fall. 
 But when the melody was young 
 Until the singers all were sung, 
 The Maker of the skies, 
 Well He just smiled on. 
 When the darkness finally fell 
 The mountains cast their spell 
 And we were together 
 With our eyes upheld 
 To the passion in the sky, 
 Our God and country lights. 
 It's an endless matter and how we did shine, 
 How we did shine beneath that night. 
 And the measure of that place 
 Was the pleasure on your face 
 As the music starts to rise 
 And the sun did fall. 
 But when the melody was young 
 Until the singers all were sung 
 The Maker of the skies, 
 Well He just smiled on.

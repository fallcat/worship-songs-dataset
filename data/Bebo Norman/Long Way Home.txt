It's a long way home, when the fists have flown 
 In the silence, there's nowhere left to run 
 It's the battle of our pending love 
 In the shadow is another smoking gun 
 When we dreamed this dream for the first it seemed 
 We could live this love for a lifetime 
 You and me 
 I will not give up this fight 
 I will not lay down and die 
 I will not carry this heart of stone 
 I may not be your place to run 
 I may not be your kingdom come 
 I may stumble through this great unknown 
 But I will be all that is true 
 I will not give up on you 
 I was made to be with you alone 
 Cause you and me, we're gonna see 
 The long way home 
 It's a long way home, and crying is done 
 But the sorrow is still wet upon your face 
 Our colliding hearts, sometimes break apart 
 But now the pieces are gathered up in grace 
 When we dream this dream for the last time we'll see 
 That we lived this love for a lifetime 
 Just you and me 
 I will not give up this fight 
 I will not lay down and die 
 I will not carry this heart of stone 
 I may not be your place to run 
 I may not be your kingdom come 
 I may stumble through this great unknown 
 But I will be all that is true 
 I will not give up on you 
 I was made to be with you alone 
 Cause you and me, we're gonna see 
 The long way home 
 Cause you and I, we're gonna fly 
 The long way home

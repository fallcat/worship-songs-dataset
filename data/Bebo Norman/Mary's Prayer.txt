Sleep baby Jesus, close Your weary eyes 
 Hide Yourself in faithful dreams before You live Your life 
 And slip away to Heaven and rest in gentle peace 
 Never to awaken the Lord Your soul to keep 
 'Cause Your feet will walk on water 
 Your eyes will pierce the dark 
 And Your heart will save the souls of men 
 Your hands will bear the scars 
 Sleep baby Jesus, for now Your time has come 
 To heal the wounded leper, to calm the raging storm 
 With perfect steps of perfect grace You leave behind Your fear 
 And walk along these dusty roads though Your fate is clear 
 'Cause Your feet walked on water 
 Your eyes pierced the dark 
 And Your heart will save the souls of men 
 Your hands will bear the scars 
 Sleep baby Jesus, my Father and my child 
 Beneath this broken cross of sin stained with men's denial 
 And though You now are breathless with thorns upon Your head 
 Your body has been broken so Your children can be fed 
 Cause Your feet have walked on water 
 Your eyes have pierced the dark 
 Your heart has saved the souls of men 
 But Your hands now bear the scars 
 And Your feet have walked on water 
 Your eyes have pierced the dark 
 And Your heart has saved the souls of men 
 Your hands now bear the scars

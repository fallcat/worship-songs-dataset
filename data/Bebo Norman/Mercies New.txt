Is it fair to say, I was lured away? 
 By endless distractions, more lovelier attractions then 
 Fairer still my own free will 
 Is the better one to blame for this familiar mess I've made again 
 So I would understand, if you were out of patience 
 And I would understand, if I was out of chances 
 Your mercies are new every morning 
 So let me wake with the dawn 
 When the music is through or so it seems to be 
 Let me sing a new song, old things gone 
 Every day it's true, you make all your mercies new 
 The distance left between East and West 
 Is how far you would come to forget the debt I'd owe 
 And thrown into the sea, the wicked ways in me 
 Will never have a chance to wash back no the sand 
 So I would understand if you would make me pay 
 I would understand lying in the bed I made again 
 Your mercies are new every morning 
 So let me wake with the dawn 
 When the music is through or so it seems to be 
 Let me sing a new song, old things gone 
 Every day it's true, you make all your mercies new 
 Up comes the sun on every one of us 
 Gone, gone, gone the guilt and shame that knew your name 
 Your mercies are new every morning 
 So let me wake with the dawn 
 When the music is through or so it seems to be 
 Let me sing a new song, old things gone 
 Every day it's true, you make all your mercies new

Am I unfit for You 
 Remember me, the one who turned from You 
 I come in rags tattered by the Fall 
 And all the earth, a witness to my crime 
 Mercy, weep over me 
 Let Your tears wash me clean 
 Majesty, be merciful with me 
 For my eyes have seen Holy 
 Hear my prayer at night 
 Let the morning find me alive 
 For I am tired and weakened by the Fall 
 Let all the earth bear witness to my cry 
 Let the Amen sound from Heaven as You lift my soul 
 Let the Amen sound from Heaven as You lift my soul 
 Let the Angels sound from Heaven, Holy is the Lord

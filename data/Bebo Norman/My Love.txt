My love, will you take my hand and run 
 My love, can't you see that we have just begun 
 When she walks into a room, the whole world freezes 
 To watch her spin just like the wind above the ground 
 She won't break into you heart, she just eases 
 Without a sound... 
 My love is deeper than the darkness of my soul 
 And my love has the habit of forgetting to let go 
 And the crowd was pressing inlike perfect strangers 
 That was the day I felt her hand slip out of mine 
 She looked at me and I don't think she even wavered 
 As she waved goodbye... 
 She did not cry... 
 But she waved goodbye... 
 My love, why did you take my heart and run 
 My love, can't you see that we had just begun

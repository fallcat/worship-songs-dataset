I am the lonely 
 The ones who slip away 
 I am the secret 
 The words we dare say 
 I am the promise I'm about to break... again 
 I am the leader 
 Who cannot find the way 
 I am the preacher 
 Who somehow lost the faith 
 I am the begger reaching out my hands... again 
 And I never saw you coming 
 I could never dream of running 
 I have never known such love before my God 
 You come, come and breathe your breath in me 
 Steal away what's left of me 
 Till you are mine and I am yours 
 I am the lover with no one to hold 
 I am the seeker with an empty soul 
 I am everyone who's ever lost hope 
 And I never saw you coming 
 I could never dream of running 
 I have never known such love before my God 
 You come, come and breathe your breath in me 
 Steal away what's left of me 
 Till you are mine and I am yours 
 Fall like stars on my shore 
 Still you are so much more 
 And I never saw you coming 
 I could never dream of running 
 I have never known such love before my God 
 You come, come and breathe your breath in me 
 Steal away what's left of me 
 Till you are mine and I am yours 
 I am yours

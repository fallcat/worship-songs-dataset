Take these hands 
 And lift them up 
 For I have not the strength to praise You near enough 
 See, I have nothing 
 I have nothing without You 
 And take my voice and pour it out 
 Let it sing the songs of mercy I have found 
 For I have nothing 
 I have nothing without You 
 And all my soul needs is all Your love 
 To cover me, so all the world will see 
 That I have nothing without You 
 Take my body and build it up 
 May it be broken as an offering of love 
 For I have nothing 
 I have nothing without You 
 And all my soul needs is all Your love 
 To cover me so all the world will see 
 That I have nothing 
 That I love You, yeah 
 With all my heart 
 With all my soul 
 With all my mind 
 And all the strength I can find 
 Take my time here on this earth 
 And let it glorify all that You are worth 
 For I am nothing 
 I am nothing without You

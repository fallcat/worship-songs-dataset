We saw the sunrise over the city 
 We saw the Angel lifting her eyes 
 You were the only one who could see me 
 I never meant to push you aside 
 I let love slip away 
 Now that you're gone, now that you're gone 
 I'm finally crawling out in the open 
 I took too long, I just took too long 
 And all that I ever wanted is broken 
 Now that you're gone 
 So much for keeping all I was feeling inside 
 So many words I wanted to say 
 So good the reasons I was hiding behind 
 So good for nothing at the end of the day 
 I let you slip away 
 I know you say we all fall down 
 I know you say we all fall down 
 I know you say we all fall down 
 What happens now, what happens now

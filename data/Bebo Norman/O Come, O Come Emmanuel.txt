O come, O come, Emmanuel, 
 And ransom captive Israel, 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the Son of God appear. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O come, thou Wisdom from on high, 
 And order all things, far and nigh; 
 To us the path of knowledge show, 
 And cause us in her ways to go. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O come, Desire of nations, bind 
 All peoples in one heart and mind; 
 Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease; 
 Fill the whole world with heaven's peace. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by thine advent here; 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O come, O come, great Lord of might, 
 Who to thy tribes on Sinai's height in 
 Ancient times once gave the law 
 In cloud and majesty and awe. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O come, thou Root of Jesse's tree, 
 An ensign of thy people be; 
 Before thee rulers silent fall; 
 All peoples on thy mercy call. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel!

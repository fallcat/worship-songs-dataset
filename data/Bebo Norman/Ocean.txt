If there is a love song left to sing 
 Then what I have is what I'll bring 
 Nothing more is more than I can give 
 If there is a light left in my eyes 
 It must be your reflection from the sky 
 Cause all I know is this 
 You are the wonder of my world 
 You are an ocean that I can get lost in 
 The first wind on my shore 
 You are the sunrise to open my eyes 
 And the dark night is no more 
 You are an ocean, you are an ocean 
 Every time I turn around 
 There's so much more left to be found 
 And every glimpse steals my breath away 
 So pen up these eyes to see 
 More of you and less of me 
 And all my fear is turning into faith 
 You are the wonder of my world 
 You are an ocean that I can get lost in 
 The first wind on my shore 
 You are the sunrise to open my eyes 
 And the dark night is no more 
 You are an ocean, you are an ocean 
 I'm drowning in your love 
 I'm drowing in your love 
 Not coming up 
 I'm not coming up 
 Cause your all I'll ever want 
 You are an ocean 
 You are an ocean 
 You are an ocean that I can get lost in 
 The first wind on my shore 
 You are the sunrise to open my eyes 
 And the dark night is no more 
 You are an ocean, you are an ocean 
 You are an ocean 
 You are an ocean

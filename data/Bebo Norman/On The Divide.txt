The sky was the color of morning 
 And the mountains surrounded 
 The ground as our bed. 
 The Spirit would rise without warning 
 Just to burn like the sun 
 That would soon warm our hands. 
 And the world was three days behind us, 
 And the world was three days ahead. 
 But for now no one could find us 
 In the wilderness. 
 Only bound by the burdens we brought, 
 But we were slowly releasing them 
 Along the way. 
 Pride was the battle we fought 
 Until we opened our eyes 
 To the Light of that day 
 The past towered before us, 
 But we could see the top of the trail. 
 So we climbed with strength we're not born with 
 And we were rising... 
 We stood on that mountain, 
 We turned to the sky. 
 With trembling inside, 
 We lifted our eyes 
 And pulling us higher... 
 Was something Divine 
 That gave us that time 
 On the Divide. 
 It was something Divine 
 That gave us that time 
 On the Divide. 
 So we turned from our view at the top 
 With a vision so clear 
 And the sun in our face. 
 And back to the valley we walked 
 Knowing everything good 
 Has its time and its place. 
 New life was brning inside us 
 Still it hurt turning to home. 
 But the same Spirit would guide us 
 That we had seen when... 
 We stood on that mountain, 
 We turned to the sky. 
 With trembling inside, 
 We lifted our eyes 
 And pulling us higher... 
 Was something Divine 
 That gave us that time 
 On the Divide. 
 It was something Divine 
 That gave us that time 
 On the Divide.

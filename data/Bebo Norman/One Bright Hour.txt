Wading through the aftermath 
 Yesterday's a photograph 
 Rummaging through faith to find a hope 
 That there will be a reckoning 
 Of the beauty and the beckoning 
 Calling me to stand on what I know 
 One bright hour, You will come for me 
 One bright hour, You'll set the captive free 
 One bright hour, You will wipe the tears away 
 From eyes that now can see one bright hour 
 He'll chase away the fleeting dark 
 From broken earth and broken heart 
 The holy line where joy and sorrow meet 
 And You will sing redemption songs 
 Making new what we made wrong 
 On the day the story is complete 
 One bright hour, You will come for me 
 One bright hour, You'll set the captive free 
 And one bright hour, You will wipe the tears away 
 From eyes that now can see one bright hour 
 One bright hour 
 I will sing Hallelujah 
 I will sing Hallelujah 
 All will sing Hallelujah 
 All will sing Hallelujah

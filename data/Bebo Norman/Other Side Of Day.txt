Was it you who spoke the earth to be? 
 And left it all in mystery 
 For the taking 
 For the taking 
 Is it thee who turned away my soul? 
 Could never have been so beautiful 
 What you gave me 
 That you gave me 
 When I've fallen in the shadows of the sun 
 Only you remain the hope on what's to come 
 Cause on a night like tonight 
 You bring me to life 
 And remind me there's another side of day 
 Where I will see all that you are 
 More than a sky full of stars 
 And the worries of this world will fall away 
 On the other side of day 
 Is it time that gets the best of us? 
 Reminding all the rest of us 
 That it's fading 
 That it's fading 
 Oh, but you still hold the hands of time 
 And pave the way of paradise 
 Can you take me? 
 Can you take me? 
 Cause the world is just the shadow of the sun 
 Only you remain the hope on what's to come 
 Cause on a night like tonight 
 You bring me to life 
 And remind me there's another side of day 
 Where I will see all that you are 
 More than a sky full of stars 
 And the worries of this world will fall away 
 On the other side of day 
 Where all who are alone 
 Finally make it home 
 To a world of wonder 
 Where love is not a lie 
 And all who see will find 
 Descent is finally over 
 Cause on a night like tonight 
 You bring me to life 
 And remind me there's another side of day 
 Where I will see all that you are 
 More than a sky full of stars 
 And the worries of this world will fall away 
 On the other side of day

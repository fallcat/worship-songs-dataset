Feels like a brand-new day 
 And I know I'm not the same 
 'Cause I see you 
 And I need you 
 And I know I couldn't leave you if I tried 
 To walk away 
 Your love won't bring me down 
 I'm living that long, long life 
 And I will not let you go 
 It's taken a long, long time 
 To get here 
 It could be a long, long life 
 But I will not let you go 
 'Cause love will be 
 Our mystery 
 So let's leave this world behind 
 And see what we can find 
 'Cause I don't need it 
 But believe it 
 And I know I couldn't keep it if I tried 
 'Cause you changed my mind 
 Your love don't bring me down 
 I'm living that long, long life 
 And I will not let you go 
 It's taken a long, long time 
 To get here 
 It could be a long, long life 
 But I will not let you go 
 'Cause love will be 
 Our mystery 
 Our mystery 
 Our mystery 
 We won't be alone 
 I'm living that long, long life 
 And I will not let you go 
 It's taken a long, long time 
 To get here 
 It could be a long, long life 
 But I will not let you go 
 'Cause love will be 
 Our mystery 
 Our mystery 
 Our mystery

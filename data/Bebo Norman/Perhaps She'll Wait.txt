They say you cannot walk before you crawl 
 I wonder why, I wonder why 
 Because everybody dreams before they fall 
 A wonder world and then we lose it all 
 But I will dream of tomorrow 
 Where the past will not be in my way 
 Passion lives another day 
 And I will dream of tomorrow 
 Where perhaps she'll wait for me 
 And every single heart that I have held 
 In my hands, in my clumsy hands 
 I fumbled them around until they fell 
 It's much safer ground just keeping to myself 
 But I still dream of tomorrow 
 Where the past will not be in my way 
 Passion lives another day 
 And I still dream of tomorrow 
 Where perhaps she'll wait for me 
 And perhaps she'll wait for me

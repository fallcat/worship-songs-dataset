Deep in the night 
 Far past the point of slumber 
 I was wrapped in a love 
 It was woven fine 
 And it pulled me under 
 And I, I didn't want to leave her 
 And I didn't want to treat her 
 Like the story of my life 
 Just like that night 
 Love was fading fast 
 Leaving me cold inside 
 And where is that part 
 That houses all my fear 
 And which is the road that I take from here 
 Where is this world, where is this world 
 Where is my seam to find the picture of things 
 Just down my road in that place 
 Would quickly go by 
 I found, in a world of its own 
 A secret flower 
 And I didn't know why 
 But I, I didn't want to leave it 
 But I knew I couldn't keep it 
 Somewhere in this desert heart of mine 
 And miles away I'm out of breath 
 And I'm outta my mind 
 And where is that part 
 That houses all my fear 
 And which is the road that I take from here 
 And where is this world, where is this world 
 Where is my seam to find the picture of things 
 And I know that time will come 
 And when all the words are said 
 And I know that time will be 
 When I consider my source instead of me 
 So pay no mind 
 No its just feel I guess 
 I'm just lonely 
 So I'm holding you again 
 I'm just lonely 
 So I'm holding you again 
 I'm just lonely 
 So I'm holding you again

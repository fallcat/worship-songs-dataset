Tell me now 
 When does this start feeling like I understand 
 Everything I'm dealing with 
 First I was young 
 Now it's all just happening 
 What about the way I said that made you turn around 
 And shake your head like I don't even know what I'm asking for 
 This could be all about just letting go 
 This could be all about just holding on 
 I can't get my feet off of the ground 
 I wanna run but I don't know how 
 Can you reach down here and pull me out 
 Can you pull me out 
 I wanna scream but there's no sound 
 I wanna fly to you somehow 
 Can you reach me here and pull me out 
 Can you pull me out, yeah 
 Remember when I was young and hungry 
 I could take it in 
 Without much money 
 I had nothing at all but dreams and time to kill 
 Now I feel like I'm treading water and I'm hardly real 
 I'm just trying harder to make my way on the earth by standing still 
 This could be all about just letting go 
 This could be all about just holding on 
 I can't get my feet off of the ground 
 I wanna run but I don't know how 
 Can you reach down here and pull me out 
 Can you pull me out 
 I wanna scream but there's no sound 
 I wanna fly to you somehow 
 Can you reach me here and pull me out 
 Can you pull me out, yeah 
 Not a moment too soon 
 You will be my rescue 
 But tell me how long will it take 
 I can't get my feet off of the ground 
 I wanna run but I don't know how 
 Can you reach me here and pull me out 
 Can you pull me out 
 I can't get my feet off of the ground 
 I wanna run but I don't know how 
 Can you reach down here and pull me out 
 Can you pull me out, yeah 
 I wanna scream but there's no sound 
 I wanna fly to you somehow 
 Can you reach me here and pull me out 
 Can you pull me out, yeah 
 Can you pull me out 
 Can you reach down here and pull me out

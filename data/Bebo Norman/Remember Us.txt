God of goodness, God of grace 
 See the tears upon our face 
 We are restless for the day that you come for us all 
 But our place is here right now 
 Still this place is breaking down 
 And some days we don't know how 
 We will make it at all 
 When our hearts are breaking 
 And our darkest hour is upon us 
 When the storm is raging 
 God of heaven, please remember us 
 When the light of day is gone 
 And our suffering is long 
 We lift up our needful song 
 To the Maker of all 
 When our hearts are breaking 
 And our darkest hour is upon us 
 When the storm is raging 
 God of heaven, please remember us 
 Please remember us 
 Glory, we cry Glory 
 All for your Glory, we cling to you 
 When our hearts are breaking 
 And our darkest hour is upon us 
 When the storm is raging 
 God of heaven, please remember us 
 When our hearts are breaking 
 And our darkest hour is upon us 
 When the storm is raging 
 God of heaven, please remember us

Lay down softly in our sorrow 
 Lay down sister to die 
 And cover over, my sweet Father 
 Cover over her eyes 
 Your broken body, it cannot weather 
 The years your youth still longs to spend 
 So go down graceful, sleep with the angels 
 And wake up whole again 
 'Cause it was not your time; that's a useless line 
 A fallen world took your life 
 But the God that sometimes can't be found 
 Will wrap Himself around you 
 So lay down, sister, lay down 
 Slower passing are the hours 
 To tell this tale that takes its time 
 But the finest moment, no man can measure 
 Is to look your Savior in the eyes 
 So take her tender to Your table 
 Take her from this killing floor 
 To taste the water that is forever 
 Let her be thirsty no more 
 It was not her time; that's a useless line 
 A fallen world took her life 
 But the God that sometimes can't be found 
 Will wrap Himself around you 
 So lay down, sister, lay down 
 And the God that sometimes can't be found 
 Will wrap Himself around you 
 So lay down, Rita, lay down

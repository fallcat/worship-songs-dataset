Laying flat upon my back 
 All the world in motion 
 Everything goes by so fast 
 I feel like I'm frozen 
 After all is said and done 
 Did I fail to mention 
 Everything I haven't done 
 All my good intentions 
 This is my holy hour, this is my world on fire 
 This is my desperate play, this is where I am saved 
 I've no fear of height or depth 
 I've no fear of crashing 
 The single thing I fear the most 
 Simply feeling nothing 
 This is my holy hour, this is my world on fire 
 This is my desperate play, this is where I am made 
 This is my kingdom come, this is my freedom song 
 This is my helpless state, this is where I am saved 
 Let my ruins become the ground you build upon 
 Let my ruins become the start 
 Let my ruins become the ground you build it on 
 From what's left of my broken heart 
 This is my holy hour, this is my world on fire 
 This is my desperate play, this is where I am made 
 This is my kingdom come, this is my freedom song 
 This is my helpless state, this is where I am saved

The time is ours, your open arms 
 These frozen fields, all here at Selwood Farm 
 This swollen love reminds me of 
 Your spilling soul that somehow always fills me up 
 Every word is true 
 Gathered hearts are here just to sing their soul to you 
 And every word is true 
 I'm happy when I'm here with you, oh with you 
 At Selwood Farm 
 I see the sisters smiling 
 I see the light upon their face 
 Here is the promise that fills this place 
 There is an edge of winter 
 But there is fire that keeps us warm 
 This is the harvest at Selwood Farm 
 And these are the sons and daughters 
 They turn in the leaves then come inside 
 I welcome the healing of all my pride 
 And this is a day worth keeping 
 This is a day worth dwelling on 
 This is the day at Selwood Farm 
 And I don't know why, but my heart just smiles 
 And I know that each day we're growing older 
 But I still know the way 
 So take me to the day 
 Take me to the day 
 At Selwood Farm

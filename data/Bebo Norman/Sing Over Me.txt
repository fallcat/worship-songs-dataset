Find me, where you can find me 
 So tired of hiding behind these songs 
 And take me where you will take me 
 Back to a place I've know all along 
 The voice that calms the waves, sing out 
 And call my name 
 Sing over me, Sing over me 
 Sing above the noise that I've been making 
 Sing over me Sing over me 
 All I ever needed was to hear your melody 
 All I ever needed was to hear your melody 
 Wake me, come on and wake me 
 So tired of living like I'm asleep 
 And hold me the way you hold me 
 How you unfold all this unbelief 
 The voice that calms the waves, sing out 
 And call my name 
 Sing over me, sing over me 
 Sing away the silence that is breaking 
 Sing over me sing over me 
 All I ever needed was to hear you melody 
 All I ever needed was to hear your melody 
 Sing out, sing out, sing out my love 
 Sing out, sing out, sing out my love 
 Sing over me, Sing over me 
 Sing above the noise that I've been making 
 Sing over me Sing over me 
 All I ever needed was to hear your melody 
 All I ever needed was to hear your melody 
 Sing over me, sing over me 
 Sing away the silence that is breaking 
 Sing over me sing over me 
 All I ever needed was to hear you melody 
 All I ever needed was to hear your melody 
 All I ever wanted was to be your melody 
 Sing out, sing out, sing out my love 
 Sing out

Take my heart, and wring it out 
 In Your hands and watch it all collapse 
 Take Your Love, and drive it in 
 Into my soul, and never leave again 
 'Cause I am so afraid 
 That I'll find myself alone 
 Looking for a savior, looking for a home 
 I am so afraid 
 That I'll find myself alone 
 Lookin' for a savior, Lookin' for a home 
 So don't leave me here alone 
 Don't leave me here alone 
 All Your hope, and all my pride 
 All this time to watch it all collide 
 When everyone seems to say, 
 'You can work it out' 
 Under my skin, I'm shaking 
 And I can't get out 
 'Cause I am so afraid 
 That I'll find myself alone 
 Looking for a savior, looking for a home 
 I am so afraid 
 That I'll find myself alone 
 Lookin' for a savior, Lookin' for a home 
 So don't leave me here 
 This is not what You said 
 It's all in my head 
 When I throw my anger at You instead 
 So don't give up on me 
 I want to believe 
 That You'll never leave me 
 But I am so afraid 
 That I'll find myself alone 
 Lookin' for a savior, lookin' for a home 
 I am so afraid 
 That I'll find myself alone 
 Deep into the ages, deep into the foam 
 I am so afraid 
 That I'll find myself alone 
 Lookin' for a savior, lookin' for a home 
 So don't leave me here alone 
 Don't leave me here alone

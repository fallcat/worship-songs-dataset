Remember the time when I thought of letting go 
 And taking back my hand 
 When all I could think was how long can I follow you 
 And where do I stand in this world 
 I lost my faith, my reason to believe 
 When I refused to see 
 Oh Lord, you carried me 
 And just like a soldier 
 You battle for my soul 
 But more like a father 
 You come and take me home 
 What is the worth of a man living for himself 
 With a heart of his own 
 And every day goes in and out, still without a sign of life 
 But father wont you please give me more 
 When everything is closing in on me 
 I know you set me free the day you died for me 
 And how is this man who calls me by name 
 And covers himself with all of my shame 
 But not even death could make you surrender 
 I remember

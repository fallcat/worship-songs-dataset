Sometimes the night was beautiful 
 Sometimes the sky was so far away 
 Sometimes it seemed to stoop so close 
 You could touch it but your heart would break 
 Sometimes the morning came too soon 
 Sometimes the day could be so hot 
 There was so much work left to do 
 But so much You'd already done 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 And I will seek You in the morning 
 And I will learn to walk in Your ways 
 And step by step You'll lead me 
 And I will follow You all of my days 
 Sometimes I think of Abraham 
 How one star he saw had been lit for me 
 He was a stranger in this land 
 And I am that, no less than he 
 And on this road to righteousness 
 Sometimes the climb can be so steep 
 I may falter in my steps 
 But never beyond Your reach 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 I will seek You in the morning 
 And I will learn to walk in Your ways 
 And step by step You'll lead me 
 And I will follow You all of my days 
 And I will follow You all of my days 
 And I will follow You all of my days 
 And step by step You'll lead me 
 And I will follow You all of my days 
 Sometimes the night was beautiful 
 (I will follow You all of my days) 
 Sometimes the night was beautiful 
 (I will follow You all of my days) 
 Sometimes the night was beautiful 
 (I will follow You all of my days) 
 Sometimes the night was beautiful 
 (I will follow You all of my days)

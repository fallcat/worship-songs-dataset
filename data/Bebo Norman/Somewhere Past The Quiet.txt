I saw you in your mourning 
 Because my room was just the same 
 Through imaginary walls of masking tape 
 And somewhere past the quiet 
 I think I, I heard you growing up 
 And I, well I don't think I'll ever be the same 
 And Dad was there beside us 
 He'd sing us into dreams 
 Of good ol' Blue and seen old roads 
 To die on 
 And river days of heat and haze 
 We'd run until the sun would fade 
 And he'd carry us up to our beds at night 
 And now we see this different angle 
 A second glance of life 
 In a world where fathers leave their boys 
 For the finer things 
 I can still remember that day 
 So hard it hurts my heart 
 To think that we were just the lucky few 
 And all along I never even knew 
 The light of day upon us 
 But now the scenery had changed 
 The Coventry was gone 'fore noon arises 
 Just bigger boys with bigger toys 
 And separate rooms to stop the noise 
 And we, we're still to young to know the finest call 
 But the holidays and candles brought the aging of our youth 
 The burning of all the innocence 
 Disguising all the truth 
 But our sunburned skin kept the taste of the salt 
 To fire the feelings we'd always fought 
 We'd found a new companion just 'fore the fall 
 And now we see this different angle 
 A second glance of life 
 In a world where fathers leave their boys 
 For the finer things 
 I can still remember that day 
 So hard it hurts my heart 
 To think that we were just the lucky few 
 And all along I never even knew 
 A season brought us back again 
 Just the three of us, alone 
 And if you ever see my heart fall again 
 Please pick it up, and bring it home 
 I saw you in your mourning 
 Because my room was just the same 
 Through imaginary walls of masking tape 
 And somewhere past the quiet 
 I think I heard you growing up 
 And I, well I don't think I'll ever be the same

Tonight I dreamed that I could not catch my breath 
 Tonight I dreamed that you were gone 
 And I could feel the ocean pound against my chest 
 In this world on my own 
 This frozen world... alone 
 But if you must go away 
 Would you find no words to say 
 Would you steal my heart away 
 Please don't go, but I know along this way 
 We've seen the miracles 
 And the long road 
 And the breath that blows across the water 
 We've seen the last line 
 Of a failing time 
 But these friends of mine are sons and daughters 
 Sons and daughters 
 Underneath a clouded sky we found a home 
 The mountains rising from the sea 
 And the falling rain washed us clean and healed our souls 
 The waters rise but then they fall 
 I close my eyes, and our summer's gone 
 And now you must go away 
 And should you find no words to say 
 And should you steal my heart away 
 I would let it go, because I know along this way

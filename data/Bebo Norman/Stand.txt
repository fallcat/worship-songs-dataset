I'm walking in an open field looking for some space to fill 
 I believe there's something left to hold 
 So even when the sun goes down and there's no one around 
 I'm standing in the freedom of my soul 
 And the truth of the matter is still the same 
 It's that you and I, we will not be here forever 
 The truth of the matter is still the same 
 I'm ready to stand 
 Ready to stand 
 Ready to stand 
 Ready to stand 
 Stand, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I know, I know, know I 
 I can see the earth from here, I can see it shake in fear 
 I can see it falling to its knees 
 But you know I'm not the same, my burden is a burning flame 
 I hold it up for all the world to see 
 But the truth of the matter is still the same 
 It's that you and I, we will not be here forever 
 The truth of the matter is still the same 
 I'm ready to stand 
 Ready to stand 
 Ready to stand 
 Ready to stand 
 Stand, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I know, I know, know I 
 I'm walking in an open field, looking for some space to fill 
 I believe there's something left to hold 
 And I can see the earth from here, I can see it shake in fear 
 I'm standing in the freedom of my soul 
 So even when the sun goes down, and there's no one around 
 Even when the sun goes down, even when the sun goes down 
 Even when the sun goes down, even when the sun goes down 
 Even when the sun goes down, even when the sun goes down 
 I stand 
 Ready to stand 
 You know, you know, you know, you know 
 I stand 
 Ready to stand 
 Stand, ready to stand

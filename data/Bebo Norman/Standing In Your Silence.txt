I came walking down this road 
 For a better point of view 
 I threw down my heavy load 
 And what I found was You 
 And all of time stood still 
 Caught up in time and space 
 I was a soul to tread 
 All weary from the race 
 And the voices in my head 
 You stepped inside 
 Changed my will (yeah) 
 Oh me Oh my 
 I'm standing in your silence 
 Gonna stand here for a long long time 
 For a long long time 
 Well it's cold behind the earth 
 For a drifting satellite 
 But you know for what its worth 
 I've been praying for daylight 
 So slow my eyes to see 
 Oh it's finally breaking day 
 And the morning time has come 
 And if I am fields of green 
 Well honey you're the sun 
 So slowly rise on me (yeah yeah) 
 Oh me Oh my 
 I am standing in your sunlight 
 Gonna stand here for a long long time 
 Take it easy 
 We can take it slow 
 I don't mind 
 You know the seasons 
 They may come and go 
 But you're always mine 
 You're always mine 
 Oh me Oh my 
 I'm standing in your silence 
 Gonna stand here for a long long time 
 Oh me Oh my 
 I'm standing in your silence 
 Gonna stand here for a long long time 
 For a long long time 
 For a long long time

Day is fading, but baby, I don't mind 
 'Cause sunlight is dancing in your eyes 
 And time is frozen but somehow flying by 
 Here with your hand holding mine 
 It just feels right kissing on a Sunday 
 I'll hold you tight as if it were the last day 
 With all my might, I will keep the world away 
 It just feels right kissing you on a Sunday 
 Time is racing to the sound of my heart beating 
 Can the dreaming escape this life 
 Unfair, maybe, but know that I'm not leaving 
 Right now, baby, life is kind 
 Make this moment last for a lifetime 
 Don't let it slip away 
 Play it over and over like your favorite song 
 And we'll fit forever in a day

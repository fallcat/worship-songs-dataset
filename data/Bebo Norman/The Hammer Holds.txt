A shapeless piece of steel 
 That's all I claim to be 
 This hammer pounds to give me form 
 This flame, it melts my dreams 
 I glow with fire and fury 
 As I'm twisted like a vine 
 My final shape, my final form 
 I'm sure I'm bound to find 
 So dream a little 
 Dream for me 
 In hopes that I'll remain 
 And cry a little 
 Cry for me 
 So I can bear the flames 
 And hurt a little 
 Hurt for me 
 My future is untold 
 But my dreams are not the issue here 
 For they, the hammer holds 
 And the water, it cools me gray 
 And the hurt's subdued somehow 
 I have my shape, this sharpened point 
 What is my purpose now? 
 And the question still remains 
 What am I to be? 
 Perhaps some perfect piece of art 
 Displayed for all to see 
 So dream a little 
 Dream for me 
 In hopes that I'll remain 
 And cry a little 
 Cry for me 
 So I can bear the flames 
 And hurt a little 
 Hurt for me 
 My future is untold 
 But my dreams are not the issue here 
 For they, the hammer holds 
 The hammer pounds again 
 But flames I do not feel 
 This force that drives me, helplessly 
 Through flesh and wood reveal 
 A burn that burns much deeper 
 It's more than I can stand 
 The reason for my life was to take 
 The life of a guiltless man 
 So dream a little 
 Dream for me 
 In hopes that I'll remain 
 And cry a little 
 Cry for me 
 So I can bear the pain 
 And hurt a little 
 Hurt for me 
 My future is so bold 
 But my dreams are not the issue here 
 For they, the hammer holds 
 This task before me may seem unclear 
 But it, my maker holds

You're waking me up from my daydream 
 Making me look up from my precious world 
 Forcing me to see your point of view 
 This broken sidewalk, not so broken as 
 The man who likes to walk, jumping all the cracks 
 Pushing his old bike, he's sure to smile at you 
 I was looking for the quick way home 
 But you were happy just to be alone 
 Something magic must have caught my eye 
 I saw the secret of the man inside 
 I saw the secret of the man inside 
 It's not the sun-baked brick lines in your skin 
 Thick with chain grease, aged and clumsy hands 
 It isn't struggled words you fight to say 
 Beneath the man-suit, beneath your purple skin 
 There is a boy who don't know that he's a man 
 He simply close his eyes and he can fly away 
 I was driving in the same old car 
 But you were dreaming of a land so far away 
 I was looking through my corner eye 
 But you were singing with the man inside 
 You were singing with the man inside 
 Some think they got a lot to offer 
 Some think they got a lot to give 
 Those people think they own this world 
 But some people know to truly live

It's as if you could find me anywhere 
 That I could go, to try to hide my thoughts from you, 
 But just like some runaway I'm leaving here 
 With half a mind that hopes, of getting caught 
 So we can just drive home in the dark where we'll let our feeling fly 
 They'll cut like shame to break me down again 
 Until there's nothing left but for me to tell you I'm sorry 
 But I don't wanna go home now 
 Stuck here in the middle alone now 
 Everybody's singing their song now 
 But I'm still reeling 
 I'm not trying to run away from 
 This beautiful life I've been given 
 I'm not looking for freedom 
 Maybe just a little meaning 
 Here in the Middle 
 It's as if there's a word uncovered by the break of day all these miles away but for a better view 
 Of what's left in the aftermath of all these years 
 It's just so hard to know who I am in you 
 So I don't wanna go home now 
 Stuck here in the middle alone now 
 Everybody's singing their song now 
 But I'm not ready for this 
 I'm not trying to run away from 
 This beautiful life I've been given 
 I'm not looking for freedom 
 Maybe just a little meaning Here in the Middle 
 All right, everybody says I'll be all right 
 Everybody says it's a good fight 
 I'm not seeing it now 
 All I know is I swear this 
 It feels a little more like a secret 
 And I don't know if I should just keep it to myself, but my Love, my Love 
 I don't wanna go home now 
 Stuck here in the middle alone now 
 Everybody's singing their song now 
 But I'm still reeling 
 I'm not trying to run away from 
 This beautiful life I've been given 
 I'm not looking for freedom 
 Maybe just a little meaning 
 Here in the Middle 
 Here in the Middle 
 Here in the Middle 
 Here in the Middle 
 Here in the Middle

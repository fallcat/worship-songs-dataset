All the streets are filled with laughter and light 
 And the music of the season 
 And the merchant's windows are all bright 
 With the faces of the children 
 And the families hurry into their homes 
 As the sky darkens and freezes 
 We'll be gathering around our hearths and tables 
 Giving thanks for God's graces 
 And the birth of the rebel Jesus 
 Well, they call Him by the Prince of peace 
 And they call Him by the Savior 
 And they pray to Him upon the seats 
 And in every bold endeavor 
 And they fill His churches with their pride and gold 
 As their faith in Him increases 
 But they've turned the nature that I worship in 
 From a temple to a robber's den 
 In the words of the rebel Jesus 
 We guard our world with locks and guns 
 And we guard our fine possessions 
 And once a year when Christmas comes 
 We give to our relations 
 And perhaps we give a little to the poor 
 If the generosity should seize us 
 But if anyone of us should interfere 
 In the business of why there are poor 
 We get the same as the rebel Jesus 
 But pardon me if I have seemed 
 To take the tone of judgment 
 For I've no wish to come between 
 This day and your enjoyment 
 In a life of hardship and of earthly toil 
 There's a need for anything that frees us 
 So I bid you pleasure and I bid you cheer 
 From a heathen and a pagan 
 On the side of the rebel Jesus

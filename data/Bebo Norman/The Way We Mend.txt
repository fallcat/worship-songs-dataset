Lately you've been all blue sky 
 And I've been rain 
 I don't mean to bust up your party 
 With all of my pain 
 But sometimes my shadows surround me 
 And you take me in your arms and say 
 It's the way we mend 
 We tear it all down and we'll start it again 
 And I don't know how but you find me where we begin 
 And that's just the way, the way that we mend 
 It's just that some voices remind me 
 I'm not strong enough 
 To put all my demons behind me 
 And carry this love 
 But just like an angel of mercy 
 You take me by my hand and say 
 They're pouring out 
 From my mouth 
 So many words all spoken wrong 
 But you come alive 
 And somehow I find my way

Have I become a soul so numb 
 All too familiar 
 Words of gold have all grown cold 
 Over and over 
 I need to see you in the sunrise 
 Time takes its toll on us 
 And it tries its best just to steal our love 
 And we bend and we break but we don't give up 
 Time takes its toll on us 
 From the start you touched my heart 
 And turned it in to something more 
 Beautiful, you're beautiful 
 So why does it have to be so hard 
 To see you in the sunrise 
 Time takes, time takes away 
 Love remains, love remains

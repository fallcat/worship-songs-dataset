It's on the tip of my heart, the words to say 
 But I fall apart and I walk away 
 There's an angry world pressed against my back 
 And at every turn I keep looking back 
 And I know you promise me 
 Love through eternity 
 So why can't I just hold on 
 I want to live, I want to love 
 But I'm afraid my simple faith will never be enough 
 I want to laugh, I want to be set free 
 And let you hold all that my soul has deep inside of me 
 But I don't know where to start 
 It's on the tip of my heart 
 So would you take my hand, because I'm sinking in 
 To this life I've made, but don't understand 
 The clock moves so slowly, but time goes so fast 
 In this whirlwind world that will never last 
 This love you're giving me 
 It's not just make believe 
 Help me just to hold one 
 You open the sky, and open my eyes 
 And all my fears are scattered away 
 So I walk in grace, because I've seen your face 
 You are all that matters to me 
 So I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love 
 I'm not afraid because your grace will always be enough 
 I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna be set free 
 And let you hold all that my soul has deep inside of me 
 You have shown me where to start 
 It's on the tip of my heart

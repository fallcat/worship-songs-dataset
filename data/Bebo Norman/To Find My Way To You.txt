Well I can't find the words to say 
 Just to make, make this go way 
 So you just bleed and I can't sleep tonight 
 'Cause it's hard to see just what you mean 
 Across the lines that bring your voice to me 
 But I can hear your every tear when you cry 
 And, oh love, when you say to me 
 That your heart breaks every time I leave 
 I would set out across the sea 
 Just to find my way to you 
 Well I don't know which way to go 
 So I search the stars, basking in the glow 
 But they all fall down without a sound from the sky 
 Well I still can't find the words to say 
 But you, my love, love me anyway 
 So just go to sleep, and my heart will keep the time 
 'Cause, oh love, when you say to me 
 That my kiss is the breath you breathe 
 I would wake up from a thousand dreams 
 Just to find my way to you

Outside my room looking in 
 You'll probably find me all over the place 
 In pictures of me back in school 
 A slight crooked kid like the smile on my face 
 And my first guitar by the bed 
 With circles of dust clinging to wood 
 It drew the first song from my head 
 Singin' if I was gone, I'd be gone for good 
 I'm afraid to grow up 
 But somewhere inside is the will of a man 
 And all I've ever wanted 
 Was something to give and love if I can 
 You make me want to try 
 You make me want to fight 
 You make me want to live 
 You make me want to give 
 And inside my room looking out 
 The colors of night all faded and bruised 
 But out from the shadows of doubt 
 You held up your heart and stepped into view 
 And under the streetlight we kissed 
 Never more tried and never more true 
 It drew a new song from my lips 
 Singing if I can fall, I'm falling for you 
 I'm afraid to grow up 
 'Cause somewhere inside I don't think I can 
 And all I've ever wanted 
 Is someone to love, and to live like a man

Every breath I breathe 
 And every song I sing 
 And every love I've ever known 
 Will never be enough 
 To ever fill me up 
 Like the calling of my soul 
 I know that everything 
 One day everything will cry out... 
 Everything under the sun 
 Voices sing out to the one 
 Who made the stars up in the sky... and you and I 
 Every heart that ever hurt 
 And every kingdom on the earth 
 Will see the heavens open up 
 Over everything under the sun 
 From the city streets 
 And from the fields of green 
 And up from every crying stone 
 There will rise a voice 
 That will leave no choice 
 It will come to call us home 
 I know that everything 
 One day everything will cry out... 
 Let it fall just like the rain 
 Hear it calling out your name 
 Let it come inside and take you over 
 Every breath I breathe 
 And every song I sing 
 And every love I've ever known

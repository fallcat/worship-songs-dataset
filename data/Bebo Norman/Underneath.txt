I saw her in a crowd 
 Or maybe in a cloud 
 Her daddy would be so proud 
 Little miss beauty queen 
 But then she fell down 
 And underneath her gown 
 No backbone could be found 
 It was all skin and nicotine 
 Underneath these empty things 
 We're made of, we're made of 
 Underneath these empty things 
 We're made of one love 
 Just past three a.m. 
 I saw a preacher man 
 He had heaven in his hand 
 On satellite TV 
 And he'll fix your sorry life 
 And then he'll fix the price 
 Because Heaven sure is nice 
 But salvation isn't free 
 And now could it be instead 
 That we've lost our innocence 
 But one day this pain will end 
 Hope is coming back again 
 And we can live forever 
 Well I have heard it said 
 That maybe God is dead 
 Or some would say instead 
 He just up and went away 
 But I saw him in a cloud 
 I saw him in a crowd 
 Yeah, he just looked around 
 And he loved us all anyway

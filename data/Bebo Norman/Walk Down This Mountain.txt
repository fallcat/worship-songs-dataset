It's a better place 
 Standing high upon this mountain 
 I've seen your face 
 Full of the light that holiest height can show 
 Blessed hand is why you you've given 
 But you've been given all you'll ever need 
 To know 
 So walk down this mountain 
 With your heart held high 
 Follow in the footsteps of your maker 
 With this love that's gone before you 
 And these people at your side 
 If you offer up your broken cup 
 You will taste the meaning of this life 
 Hey hey 
 Well it's a common ground 
 And I see you're all still standing 
 But just look around and you'll find 
 The very face of God 
 He's walking down into the distance 
 He's walking down to where the masses are 
 So walk down this mountain 
 With your heart held high 
 Follow in the footsteps of your maker 
 With this love that's gone before you 
 And these people at your side 
 If you offer up your broken cup 
 You will taste the meaning of this life 
 Hey hey 
 This life 
 We're standing in a place of peace 
 And this is how the world should be 
 How the world should be 
 (Walk down this mountain with your heart held high) 
 How the world should be 
 (Walk down this mountain with you heart held high) 
 How the world should be 
 (Walk down this mountain with your heart held high) 
 How the world should be 
 So walk down this mountain 
 With your heart held high 
 Follow in the footsteps of your maker 
 With this love that's gone before you 
 And these people at your side 
 If you offer up your broken cup 
 You will taste the meaning of this life 
 Hey hey 
 Hey hey

I step outside into the light. 
 And as I walk and talk and say good-bye 
 I cannot smile, I cannot cry 
 Those feelings so extreme, please tell me why. 
 Walking away, 
 Why must the season's change 
 Take me away 
 From ones that I love? 
 Walking away, 
 Why must the feelings change 
 And take me away? 
 I'm crying, Lord, please don't fail me now. 
 Days of dust go rambling by, 
 Running circles around my dreams and my life. 
 By the stare found deep in her eyes 
 A fleeting glimpse of love is passing her by. 
 Walking away, 
 Why must the season's change 
 Take me away 
 From the ones that I love? 
 Walking away, 
 Why must the feelings change 
 And take me away? 
 I'm crying, Lord, please don't fail me now.

Wash me clean again 
 And take me down in your water 
 And try to make me understand 
 Cause in this life that I live 
 I might have grown a little harder 
 But so have these times 
 Where we just war with words 
 And fight for rights to take a life 
 In the name of peace 
 But we cannot hide behind our picket fences, 
 Abortion lines, and warn defences 
 I don't understand 
 Touch and go, it survives 
 In this land of our fathers 
 The bleeding and the needing 
 Are left behind 
 You say one name out aloud 
 While inside you feel another 
 But there is some comfort in pleasing the crowd 
 So you just raise your hands up to the sky 
 And scream a verse that will make them cry 
 But when those politics 
 They don't stick around 
 Those words fight back 
 They'll take you down 
 And you won't understand 
 So lord search my soul 
 And find the need to break this stone 
 And plant a seed and find me 
 Find a place for me inside

Today is not a good day 
 Stranded in the heartache 
 Watching all the world race 
 And pass me by 
 Like a wave on the ocean 
 Comes a flood of emotion 
 And it can't go unspoken 
 No it can't go unspoken one more time 
 We fall apart just to come alive 
 A broken heart can shatter all the lies 
 A brand new start and a goodbye 
 We fall apart just to come alive 
 Yeah but this is still a good life 
 Standing in the sunlight 
 Scattering a long line 
 Of fear and shame 
 Cause underneaththe surface there's a heart and a purpose 
 And I swear that its just worth it 
 Yeah I swear that its worth it 
 It not in vain 
 We fall apart just to come alive 
 A broken heart can shatter all the lies 
 A brand new start and a goodbye 
 We fall apart just to come alive 
 Just to come alive 
 You save me 
 You save me 
 I'm alive I'm alive 
 Cause you save me 
 We fall apart just to come alive 
 A broken heart can shatter all the lies 
 A brand new start and a goodbye 
 We fall apart just to come alive 
 Just to come alive

What child is this, who, laid to rest, 
 On Mary's lap is sleeping? 
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, 
 While shepherds watch are keeping? 
 This, this is Christ the King, 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing; 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud, 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 Why lies He in such mean estate 
 Where ox and ass are feeding? 
 Good Christian, fear, for sinners here 
 The silent Word is pleading. 
 This, this is Christ the King, 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing; 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud, 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh, 
 Come, peasant, King, to own Him; 
 The King of kings salvation brings, 
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him. 
 This, this is Christ the King, 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing; 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud, 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 Nails and spear shall pierce Him through 
 The cross be born for me, for you 
 Hail, hail, the Word made flesh 
 The Babe, the Son of Mary

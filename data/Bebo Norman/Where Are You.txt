Take another look at me, oh, breaker of my heart 
 Take a look and you will see, how beautiful you are 
 'Cause even when I walk away, I could not go very far 
 Before the child in me would say, home is where you are 
 And in the tapestry of time, I cannot imagine where 
 I could find someone as kind on the ground or in the air 
 'Cause I have heard that angels fly and they never show their face 
 So I suppose that from the sky, one landed in your place 
 And did you know right from the start 
 When you first held me in your arms 
 That you would always hold my heart 
 Where you are 
 You make the mornings seem so light with coffee in the air 
 But to be a mother and a wife is a heavy load to bear 
 And so you gave your life away like the God inside your heart 
 And even though we've gone away, home is where you are 
 It's where you are

I don't know why 
 I always run 
 Is it fear of the fall? 
 Or fear of the touch 
 And I don't know where 
 The angels sleep 
 I don't know how 
 To really love 
 I've never stood still 
 Long enough 
 I don't know where 
 The angels sleep 
 But I am alive 
 Standing strong 
 I'm no farther forward 
 Just farther along 
 Hold onto my pride 
 I'm digging deep 
 It's pulling me down 
 And I am no closer 
 To thee 
 And I don't know where 
 The angels sleep 
 I don't know how 
 To see you 
 A friend from before 
 Is different somehow 
 I don't know where 
 The angels sleep 
 And I don't know when 
 I'll love again 
 But I don't trust myself 
 To just let you in 
 I don't know where 
 The angels sleep 
 But I am alive 
 Standing strong 
 I'm no farther forward 
 Just farther along 
 I've held onto my pride 
 Digging deep 
 It's pulling me down 
 I am no closer 
 To thee 
 And I don't know where 
 The angels sleep 
 Its taken ten thousand days 
 To get stuck in my ways 
 It offers no grace 
 I cannot stand this place 
 With love and my faith 
 I walk away slowly 
 I don't know where 
 The angels sleep 
 I don't know where 
 The angels sleep

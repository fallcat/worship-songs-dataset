Everyone it seems 
 Is looking for the grass that's greener here 
 And through my window pane 
 The scenery flies by and disappears 
 So tell to me the secret 
 That won't let the memories fade away 
 Until I am home again... where the trees stand still 
 Yesterday it seems 
 I traveled in a younger man's clothes 
 Living out this dream 
 And wandering through fields of touch and go 
 Moving on forever 
 Watching the distance fade away 
 But now I just want to land... where the trees stand still 
 All this time 
 On this line 
 Here then I am gone 
 Tonight I want a life 
 Where the faces are the same most every day 
 Tonight I want a wife 
 To sit with me and watch our children play 
 All the world between us 
 Watching the years fade away 
 And when the laughing's done... we'll watch the trees stand still 
 Everyday... where the trees stand still 
 We will make a home... where the trees stand still

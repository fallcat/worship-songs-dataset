Take another look at me 
 Oh breaker of my heart 
 Take a look and you will see 
 How beautiful you are 
 Even when I walk away 
 I could not go very far 
 Before the child in me would say 
 Home is where you are 
 In the tapestry of time 
 I cannot imagine where 
 I could find someone as kind 
 On the ground or in the air 
 I have heard that angels fly 
 And they never show their face 
 So I suppose that from the sky 
 One landed in your place 
 Did you know right from the start 
 When you first held me in your arms 
 That you would always hold my heart 
 Where you are 
 You make the mornings seem so light 
 With coffee in the air 
 But to be a mother and a wife 
 Is a heavy load to bear 
 And so you gave your life away 
 Like the God inside your heart 
 And even though we've gone away 
 Home is where you are 
 It's where you are...

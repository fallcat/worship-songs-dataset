In the passion of Your sacrifice 
 I saw the prophecy fulfilled 
 Healer of the world, the wounded cry 
 I heard You say come follow me 
 So I will, yes I will 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill (I will follow You) 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill 
 To the cross where the river runs 
 Crimson even still, yes I will 
 Follow You Lord (follow You) 
 I will, yes I will 
 On the sacred path, You bled for us 
 Scored and broken, up that hill 
 Terrible the cross, how glorious 
 I heard You say, come follow me 
 So I will, yes I will 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill (I will follow You) 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill 
 To the cross where the river runs 
 Crimson even still, yes I will 
 Follow You Lord (follow You) 
 I will, yes I will 
 When I stumble in the darkness 
 Hear my weakness, when I'm fearing 
 (Hear me Jesus) Hear me Jesus when I call Your name 
 Oh help me Lord, Lord You help me Lord 
 Please help me Lord, Lord You help me Lord 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill (I will follow You) 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill 
 To the cross where the river runs 
 Crimson even still, yes I will 
 Follow You Lord (follow You) 
 I will, yes I will 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill (I will follow You) 
 Follow You Jesus, all the way up that hill 
 To the cross where the river runs 
 Crimson even still, yes I will 
 Follow You Lord (follow You) 
 I will, yes I will 
 Help me Jesus, when I feel afraid

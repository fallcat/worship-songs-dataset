There's never a day away from you 
 I'm not a complete mess 
 If I ever stay away from you 
 It's only emptiness 
 But love lasts longer 
 And love stands stronger 
 Than anything that's in between us 
 There's never a day away from you 
 Girl, you surround me 
 You're all around me 
 You capture me with everything you do 
 Girl, you surround me 
 There's never a day away from you 
 When I'm able to breathe 
 Whatever this world is coming to 
 I want you next to me 
 Because love lasts longer 
 And love stands stronger 
 Than anything that's in between us 
 There's never a day away from you 
 Girl, you surround me 
 You're all around me 
 You capture me with everything you do 
 Girl, you surround me 
 You're all around me 
 You capture me with everything you do 
 Girl, you surround me 
 And I know the sun will rise and fall 
 But we will make it through it all 
 I will love you until life is over

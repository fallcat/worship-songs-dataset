Sweetly singing o'er the plains 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains 
 Alleluia, alleluia 
 Gloria in Excelsis Deo 
 Gloria in Excelsis Deo 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why's your joyous song prolong? 
 What the gladsome tidings be 
 That inspired this heavenly song? 
 Gloria in Excelsis Deo 
 Gloria in Excelsis Deo 
 Oh, come to Bethlehem and see 
 Him whose birth the angels sing 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ, the Lord, our newborn King 
 Gloria in Excelsis Deo 
 Gloria in Excelsis Deo 
 Gloria in Excelsis Deo

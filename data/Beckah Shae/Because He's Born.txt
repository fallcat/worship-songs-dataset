Mary, don't you cry 
 For unto you tonight is born the Savior Child 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 Born a virgin birth 
 He's come to earth us a peace we don't deserve 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 And love will reign forevermore 
 Because He's born, the Savior's born 
 And peace will reign forevermore 
 Because He's born, the Savior's born 
 Gold and frankincense 
 Bring Him all things fair to lay before a king 
 King of Israel, King of Israel, King of Israel 
 And every knee shall bow 
 And every tongue confess He's Emmanuel 
 The King, the King 
 King of Israel, King of Israel, King of Israel 
 And love will reign forevermore 
 Because He's born, the Savior's born 
 And peace will reign forevermore 
 Because He's born, the Savior's born 
 Can you hear the herald Angels cry? 
 "Hosanna to the new born Child" 
 Can you hear the herald Angels sing? 
 "Hosanna to the new born Child" 
 Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna 
 Oh, and love will reign forevermore 
 Because He's born, the Savior's born 
 And peace will reign forever more 
 Because He's born, the Savior's born 
 Because He's born, He's born, He's born

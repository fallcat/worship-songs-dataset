Goodwill and generosity 
 Oh, good times at all the gatherings 
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Friends and all the festivities 
 Oh family, you finally get to see 
 This is the greatest time of the year 
 When everybody gets to give someone 
 A gift of tidings and good cheer 
 Or maybe something better like a little loving letter 
 See it all comes down to love, not just a season, it's the reason for love 
 The greatest gift ever to be given to us all was this love 
 So let's rejoice and make a choice this Christmas time to choose love 
 Oh, it all comes down to love 
 Carolers stopping by to sing 
 Hot cocoa by the fire crackling 
 Oh, yet there must be someone out there wondering 
 About somebody else who's lost and lonely 
 This is the greatest time of the year 
 For everyone who gives a little something 
 More than just good tidings or cheer 
 'Cause remember in December Christmas 
 Seems like just a day without love 
 It's all about love, not just a season, it's the reason for love 
 The greatest gift ever to be given to us all was this love 
 So let's rejoice and make a choice this Christmas time to choose love 
 Oh, it all comes down to love 
 Oh, it's all about love, not just a season, it's the reason for love 
 The greatest gift ever to be given to us all was this love 
 So let's rejoice and make a choice this Christmas time to choose love 
 Oh, it all comes down to love

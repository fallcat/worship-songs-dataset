 D-D-Do not G-Give up 
 Do not give up 
 Do not... 
 Let's not grow, weary in doing good 
 For in due time 
 We'll reap the harvest 
 If we do not, give up 
 Therefore be steadfast and unmovable 
 Always abounding 
 In the work of the Lord, knowing it is not in vain 
 Do not give up 
 D-D-Do not, Do not

 Do not, do not, do not give up 
 The Harvest is comin' 
 Let's not grow, weary in doing good 
 For in due time 
 We'll reap the harvest 
 If we do not, give up (uh-uh-oh) 
 Therefore be steadfast and unmovable 
 Always abounding 
 In the work of the Lord, knowing it is not in vain 
 Do not give up 
 D-D-Do not, Do not 
 G-Give up

So I've decided, I'm gonna believe like a child 
 Just like them all the while, still carrying my grown up smile 
 'Cause I can't help this feeling that I get when i 
 Look beyond my own two eyes and see my courage come alive 
 I love the miracles, oil, fire 
 Gold dust, gemstones and rainbows 
 I love the wonders and signs, the glory 
 The laughter, the joy, the new wine 
 Faith is being sure of what we hope for 
 Certain of the things unseen oh 
 But to believe just like this little mustard seed 
 I can be a big tree oh 
 I want to be the one who walks on water 
 To believe is just the least I can do to please my father 
 So I've decided, I can't convince you to believe in 
 All the crazy, amazing things I've been seeing 
 But if you only, knew just how big his love is for ya 
 There's nothing your eyes could show ya 
 That could compare to what's in store 
 I wanna see a mountain move, just 'cause I told it to 
 I wanna see my bread and fish be multiplied too 
 Or build an arch like noah, who never saw the rain 
 Split the sea in two or bring a dead man back again 
 And for the blind, I want restored sight 
 And I'm feeling just fine giving my water for wine 
 I want to be the one who walks on water

Even in your darkest days, love will find a way 
 To show itself in everything, you know it's so wonderful 
 And if you find a hurt that just won't go away, hope will find a way 
 To prove itself true again, through the promise of a better day 
 Faith, Hope and Love 
 Have a way of making life easier 
 If you could just believe them, aim for these and 
 Nothing can keep you down, it can be turned around 
 Faith, Hope and Love, 
 Are the only three that last forever 
 They will always be, all that you need 
 Just keep your head to the sky and you will learn to fly 
 So many seasons come and go, and we never know 
 Just what the next day brings, you know it might just be beautiful 
 And when you see beyond your eyes that's when you'll know 
 Faith will find a way, to reveal truth to you 
 Ready to take you on a joy ride 
 And faith is the certainty in all that you can't see 
 Faith is being so sure of all that you hope for... eternal glory 
 My hope is fixed on a place where I can behold Your face 
 Your grace, oh and Your mercy 
 And now I know that Your love is all that I need 
 'Cause I believe in You I am free!

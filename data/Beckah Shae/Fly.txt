Here is where I belong now 
 High above the fear and doubt 
 I know nothing can keep me down 
 Everywhere I look is up 
 It's the only way that I can fly 
 With the Son in my eyes 
 I've got love, peace and a sound mind 
 Rising above the clouds and the rain 
 I know it's going to be ok 
 I'll never give up 
 No matter what comes my way 
 Cause tomorrow always brings a new day 
 Fly, Fly, Fly higher and higher 
 Fly, Fly, Fly I can feel my faith arise 
 Here is where my joy is found 
 High above the tears and frowns 
 Cause in Your presence I'm no longer bound 
 Looking forward to the great unknown 
 Cause it is well with my soul 
 I put my trust in You alone 
 'Cause I know You are faithful 
 And as I wait 
 You give me new strength 
 To run and not grow weary 
 Walk and not faint 
 Soaring on love 
 With forgiveness as the key 
 I'm unlocking Your truth and freedom in me 
 Fly, Fly, Fly higher and higher 
 Fly, Fly, Fly I can feel my faith arise 
 Soaring, Exploring, 
 In new realms of glory 
 Oh I see, Your majesty 
 And I am amazed! 
 You cover me with your feathers 
 Under Your wings I am safe 
 I hear the beating of Your heart 
 And I know I'm in the right place 
 Fly, Fly, Fly higher and higher 
 Fly, Fly, Fly I can feel my faith arise 
 Fly, Fly, Fly higher and higher 
 Fly, Fly, Fly I can feel my faith arise

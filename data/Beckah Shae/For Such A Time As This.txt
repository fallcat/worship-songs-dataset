I'm just an ordinary person 
 With so much resistance and so many hindrances 
 I'm just a common average woman 
 With an ugly past that keeps tryin' to hold me back 
 Limitations all surround me 
 And this world thinks that it's drowning in hopelessness 
 Then I hear you call my name out loud 
 And I say yes 
 Just a moment for a lifetime 
 For such a time as this I say yes 
 I've been chosen to arise 
 For such a time as this and I say yes 
 Alive awake alert I know I don't deserve 
 Why I'm in this position 
 But I'm here ready to serve 
 Willing to lose it all I'm answering your call 
 Oh heart and soul please listen 
 For the mandate must be heard 
 Your grace and favor crown me 
 And I need your strength around me 
 'Cause I still fear how hard it might be 
 Then I hear you call my name out loud 
 And I say yes 
 Just a moment for a lifetime 
 For such a time as this I say yes 
 I've been chosen to arise 
 For such a time as this and I say yes 
 And what's worth living for if nothing is worth dying for 
 I'm gonna make a stand I'm gonna make an echo 
 I'm gonna make some history with his story 
 Writing the pages of today to read about tomorrows change 
 'Cause I know I was made for such a time as this 
 Just a moment for a lifetime 
 For such a time as this I say yes 
 I've been chosen to arise 
 For such a time as this and I say yes

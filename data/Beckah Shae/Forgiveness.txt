Betrayed and let down, they gossip and slander 
 They sabotage You as they mock You, it's just a mess! 
 But I refuse to amuse the lies 
 And whether or not they apologize 
 I'm movin on, I'm gonna let go 
 'Cause I gotta fly 
 Laying down all that's in the past, no bitterness 
 Putting aside all my pain and my pride, to be blessed 
 I've learned what we hold against someone else 
 Will only wind up hurting ourselves 
 We need love motivation 
 Forgiveness! 
 There's healing in your wings 
 Your peace it let's me breathe 
 Forgiveness! 
 You're the reason why I live 
 I'm worth only what I give 
 Forgiveness 
 The damage is done, the scars still remain 
 But I gained wisdom and strength 
 So I declare the victory is won! 
 I refuse to amuse the pain 
 Won't let it take my freedom away 
 I'm movin on, I'm gonna let go, 
 Cause tomorrow's a better day! 
 I am so imperfect, I am only human 
 And I'm whole heartedly asking You to forgive me, oh 
 Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me 
 MOC 
 You gotta take in the air and just breathe in 
 Believe in 
 In order to let a broken heart start beat, beat beatin' again 
 A gain of restored grace 
 From a flash in a past space 
 What's left is a bad taste 
 Repairing from despair 
 Which left you unaware 
 That others desperation of hatin' 
 Which had you statin' what was done in the past, 
 History, so ill, 
 The sting from the blow, fast hit, it's so real 
 Faced with the options presented 
 Forgive or resent it/ to live or regret it/ grip or forget it 
 You gotta love or hate it 
 See, the truth's been stated 
 Let it go, 'cause the past has been dated 
 Now pardon me of my faults in the fall of me 
 Dignity placed in all we see 
 Drawn from a source of what we can't force 
 A loving trace of a crimson course 
 Of course, no remorse in...

Rock, rock 
 Give me that rock 
 That hip, that rock 
 Give me that funky 
 Give me that funky 
 Yo stick it in red 
 We got the cred 
 No need to say what's already been said 
 Don't need to please 
 When we got the proof 
 We be on our knees 
 When we raise the roof 
 'Cause we got the 
 Wow pow mix of flavor 
 We got the funky Jesus blazer 
 No equal 
 Diverse people 
 Come get it now 
 Won't be a sequel 
 None of that mumbo jumbo 
 Give me that hip hop funk soul 
 Give me that funky Jesus music 
 Give me that soulful gumbo 
 Give me that funky 
 Funky Jesus music 
 Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul 
 Give me that juicy flow 
 Give me that funky 
 Funky Jesus music 
 Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul 
 And watch this party grow 
 Let's go 
 Look at them freaks, they fashion loud 
 Makin' that hotness, movin' that crowd 
 Bumpin' that jump with a life injection 
 Sweet to the ears like the candy section 
 Hits to the eyes 
 Feels so fly 
 Fashion that just won't subside 
 We got this winner's ball 
 So check it out 
 Gonna' watch 'em fall 
 We're goin' back 
 We're goin' way back 
 From coast to coast 
 This is the most 
 We got beats and rhymes 
 And after shows 
 We got funky people on the highs and lows 
 M-C's like Wiggy they call us pros 
 So, sure shot, I could take stock of this 
 I'll play the post in the b-boy bliss 
 See, we bum rush with no discussion 
 A red hot show with freak production 
 Give me that funky 
 Funky Jesus music 
 Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul 
 Give me that juicy flow 
 Give me that funky 
 Funky Jesus music 
 Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul 
 And watch this party grow 
 Give me that funky 
 Funky Jesus music 
 Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul 
 Give me that juicy flow 
 Give me that funky 
 Funky Jesus music 
 Give me that hip, that rock, that funky soul 
 And watch this party grow 
 Let's go

What don't kill you can only make you Stronger! 
 I've taken a few blows, but I'm ok though, you know I just keep going! 
 I've been straight knocked down, but I get up again, 'cause I ain't no quitter! 
 So let me take time to be thankful, for the way I've been made stronger! 
 Going through the Fire, But coming out GOLD! 
 And I'm going Higher with my feet still on the floor. 
 Pushed back, pushed down, pushed away, 
 It's ok, 'cause I just keep movin forward! 
 Talking smash all that trash that they say, 
 It just ain't worth my consideration. No! 
 So Ima take this time to be thankful for the way I've been made stronger! 
 'Cause I can take the pain, its for my good anyway, 
 'Cause I ain't gonna break, Love holds me together. 
 This fire is makin' me better, refined it don't matter whether, 
 I'm lookin' like a loser, cause ima show you all a winner! 
 You can have it all 'cause I'm a giver, 
 But ain't givin' up, I ain't no quitter! 
 So I think its better off you know, I'm comin' out Gold!

In the winderness he was offered all the kingdoms of the world 
 If he would just bow down and worship 
 "All these things I will give if you just bow down and worship me" 
 See the tempter knew all he had to do 
 Was persuade the Son of God, for the battle to be over 
 But he failed when Christ died, and severed the veil! 
 Hallelujah 
 But Christ entered that most holy place 
 As high priest 
 No more sacrifice 
 The price has been paid 
 Once and for all 
 For our eternal grace 
 And the veil has been torn 
 The freedom is ours 
 Lord I give you my sincere heart 
 And in spirit and truth 
 I worship You! 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lord, God Almighty 
 The One who always was, who is, and who is still to come

And his blood has ransomed people for God 
 From every tribe and language, people, every nation 
 Where warriors have fallen, there's a resurrection comin' 
 It's Your time to rise and shine 
 Oh wake up, you sleeping giant 
 The wounds of injustice are being healed by the peace 
 Of Yahweh, who's bringing us power through unity 
 Where warriors have fallen, there's a resurrection comin' 
 Dry bones, dry bones, come alive 
 Yeah wake up, You sleeping giant 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it 
 Yeshua, bring us together, bring us together 
 Together we cry 
 Yeshua, bring us together, bring us together 
 Together we cry 
 Yeshua, bring us together, bring us together 
 Together we cry 
 Out-out for Your heartbeat, Your heartbeat, oh 
 Give us Your heartbeat, yeah 
 This is the hour to know whose side to stand by 
 Raise up a standard in battle for every fellow tribe 
 Where warriors are fighting, there's a revival igniting 
 Reserved for such a time 
 Yeah arise, You blazing fire 
 Brave ones stand firm and listen to your destiny 
 The rhythm of our Father moves with victory 
 Where warriors are fighting, there's a revival igniting 
 Consume us oh God, and arise, blazing fire 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it 
 Your heartbeat, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it 
 Yeshua, bring us together, bring us together 
 Together we cry 
 Yeshua, bring us together, bring us together 
 Together we cry 
 Yeshua, bring us together, bring us together 
 Together we cry 
 Out-out for Your heartbeat, Your heartbeat, oh

So I woke up in the morning 
 With only one word on my mind 
 It was given to me in my sleep 
 And I knew I just had to find 
 The meaning, the answer 
 The reason for this mystery 
 Oh, and I knew it came from you 
 'Cause I felt this overwhelming peace 
 You said I am a crown of splendor 
 You said I am a royal diadem in your hand 
 You've called me hephzibah 
 You've called me hephzibah 
 I'm no longer forsaken, oh but to know 
 That you delight in me 
 And you call me hephzibah 
 So I was once desperately 
 Insecure and desolate 
 What damaged dignity 
 In all my sins and faults and bruises 
 Trying to find my beauty 
 Seemed impossible to me 
 Till you came and took my shame 
 And dressed me up in your glory 
 You said I am a crown of splendor 
 You said I am a royal diadem in your hand 
 You've called me hephzibah 
 You've called me hephzibah 
 I'm no longer forsaken, oh but to know 
 That you delight in me 
 And you call me hephzibah 
 What magnificent exchange 
 You've adorned me with your name 
 Your beauty for my sin 
 And here I stand not just forgiven 
 But dressed in royalty, as you rejoice over me 
 As a bridegroom for his bride 
 Now I can see you and how you really see me

Oh I want more of you, so come meet me here in this place 
 And how I need you, I just can't keep doing things my own way 
 I've decided there's not a moment where 
 My life is fulfilled without you 
 So come and reveal your truth to me 
 Give me ears to hear, eyes to see, and let your love remind me 
 You are my shining star 
 Leading me to my destiny 
 And my faith increases every time I see your gifts displayed 
 Oh, how they amaze me 
 And in this hour, release your power 
 And let your peace saturate me 
 So come and reveal your truth to me 
 Give me ears to hear, eyes to see, a heart that's free 
 Holy spirit come, and fill me with your love 
 Holy spirit consume me, and overwhelm me with your peace 
 Holy spirit move, I wanna do the things you do 
 Holy spirit make me whole, and put that joy deep in my soul 
 Oh I have a desire to know more of your glory 
 I know the reality of heaven is so much more than it's story 
 So I'm inviting you to right here where I am 
 To experience just who you are 
 So please demonstrate for me miracles 
 Your signs, wonders, visions and dreams 
 So secrets be told, and mysteries unfold 
 Open up your heaven, let your anoiting flow 
 So come and reveal your truth to me 
 Give me ears to hear, eyes to see, a heart that's free, oh! 
 Holy spirit come, and fill me with your love 
 Holy spirit consume me, and overwhelm me with your peace 
 Holy spirit move, I wanna do the things you do 
 Holy spirit make me whole, and put that joy deep in my soul 
 I wanna move like the wind apart from my control 
 You are my confidence, oh how you make me bold 
 I can heal the sick, raise the dead, I can cast out demons 
 I wanna move like the wind apart from my control 
 You are my confidence oh how you make me bold 
 From rainbows to prophecy, your revelation is all I need 
 Holy spirit come, and fill me with your love 
 Holy spirit consume me, and overwhelm me with your peace 
 Holy spirit move, I wanna do the things you do 
 Holy spirit make me whole, and put that joy deep in my soul

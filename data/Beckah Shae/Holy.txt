Nothing could ever compare to you 
 You're so amazing 
 No one could ever do the things the way you do 
 Your love saves me 
 Some try but they just can't get it right no 
 No power no might only by your holy spirit 
 I'ma overflow oh 
 You're so beautiful perfect in all your ways 
 And I'm amazed You're so holy 
 So magnificent and holy 
 I've got nothing to give but my praise 
 Holy, holy, holy are you Lord 
 There's no one like you 
 You're glorious 
 It's overwhelming just the thought 
 Of your unending love 
 Righteousness and goodness and purity 
 Worthy of my complete devotion you're all I need 
 We are desperate for you 
 Only you can make us new 
 Ever so lovely I know I was only made for your glory 
 So fill us with your sound turn it around 
 As we bow down proclaiming you are holy 
 Yeshua

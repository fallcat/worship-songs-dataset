And this is a song for those who need hope, 
 For those who can't see it, 
 Though there's more than enough 
 And it's found in His everlasting love. 
 This is a song for those who feel weak, 
 For those who can't speak... 
 I'll be the words you need. 
 Just open your heart and agree. 
 We're all part of a plan, 
 We've got a purpose. 
 We've got a destiny. 
 We're all headed somewhere and we're going soon 
 'Cause yeah! We choose to believe. 
 Halleluiah! Raise the banner high! 
 We're gonna let the whole world know! 
 Hosannah! He's coming like fire in the sky 
 To take His children home. 
 Halleluiah! Raise the banner high! 
 We're gonna let the whole world know! 
 Hosannah! He's coming like fire in the sky 
 To take His children home. 
 And this is a song for the broken spirit, 
 Whose wounds have sealed, yet you still feel it. 
 The pain is a weapon if you know how to use it. 
 And this is a song for those who are hated, 
 For those who have traded all of this world 
 To keep your soul. 
 You're goin' through the fire but you're comin' out gold! 
 We're all part of a plan, 
 We've got a purpose. 
 We've got a destiny. 
 We're all headed somewhere and we're going soon 
 'Cause yeah! We choose to believe. 
 Halleluiah! Raise the banner high! 
 We're gonna let the whole world know! 
 Hosannah! He's coming like fire in the sky 
 To take His children home. 
 Halleluiah! Raise the banner high! 
 We're gonna let the whole world know! 
 Hosannah! He's coming like fire in the sky 
 To take His children home. 
 And love covers a multitude of sins 
 It's why it always wins, 
 Its mercy never ends. 
 It's sooner than we think 
 We've gotta hold fast, 
 The confession of our faith... 
 Cause everything else, will all fade away, 
 While love and justice remains, it'll be okay, 
 We've just got to believe 
 That we're all a part of the victory, 
 And we've got a reason to sing! 
 Halleluiah! Raise the banner high! 
 We're gonna let the whole world know! 
 Hosannah! He's coming like fire in the sky 
 To take His children home. 
 Halleluiah! Raise the banner high! 
 We're gonna let the whole world know! 
 Hosannah! He's coming like fire in the sky 
 To take His children home.

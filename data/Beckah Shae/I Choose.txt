Just cause, maybe, 
 I don't really know. 
 It's not me. Don't understand? 
 Maybe tomorrow. 
 But then again if You could only see 
 I'm not Your ordinary situation or circumstance. 
 Yes, no. Hot. Cold. 
 Which way do I go? 
 Never before has there ever been more opportunity for this, 
 Chance to make up my mind, 
 It's time to decide, I've got no more... 
 Oh! No more excuses! I ain't got much time 
 Gotta get it together, gotta get it right. 
 My lungs are breathin, My heart is beatin' 
 Only because of Your love. 
 I just can't keep runnin' from Ya, 
 I surrender! 
 I Choose You. I Choose truth. I Choose life. I Choose You! 
 One shot, I only got 
 One opportunity. 
 A window to really show 
 That I can more than be 
 One who settles, 'cause I'm a go getter 
 And I want something better, 
 All that heaven has for me yah! 
 Blessed in blessed out. 
 Goin' up no longer down. 
 Never before has there ever been more opportunity for this... 
 Chance to make up my mind, 
 It's time to decide, I've got no more... 
 Oh! No more excuses, I ain't got much time. 
 Gotta get it together, gotta get it right 
 My lungs are breathin, My heart is beatin', 
 Only because of Your love. 
 I just can't keep runnin' from Ya, 
 I surrender! 
 I choose You. I choose truth. I choose life. 
 I choose livin' over dyin', 
 Blessing over cursing. 
 I choose You. I choose truth. I choose life. 
 I choose truth over lyin', 
 Freedom over prison. 
 I choose You. I choose truth. I choose life. 
 I choose grace over hating, 
 Joy instead of mourning. 
 I choose You. I choose truth. I choose life. 
 I choose now over too late, 
 This is a final warning!

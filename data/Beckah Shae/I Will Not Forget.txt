I will not forget you 
 Your fragile body that was slain 
 I will not forget you 
 The sacrifice of blood you gave 
 I will not forget you 
 And how your faithfulness remains 
 I wil not forget you 
 And how your love keeps me amazed 
 Oh, there have been days when I thought I might crumble 
 When I was too weak to climb, feeling so empty inside 
 I thought I might find the answers in my own strength 
 In my own way of doing things 
 But all that led to was insecurity and pain 
 Disappointment, embarrassment, regret and shame 
 Oh and I knew that all my efforts had all been in vain 
 You said, take this bread and cup 
 In remembrace of my eternal love 
 My grace will always be enough 
 I will not forget you 
 Your fragile body that was slain 
 I will not forget you 
 The sacrifice of blood you gave 
 I will not forget you 
 And how your faithfulness remains 
 I wil not forget you 
 And how your love keeps me amazed 
 Oh, how could I ever have missed it 
 An opportunity to get to know more of you? 
 For all you desire is to commune 
 And remind me of your truth, hallelujah! 
 Now all that's left is, my whole heart and devotion 
 The least I could give to you my king, my portion 
 So I choose this day, to meet you here with all my praise 
 You said, take this bread and cup 
 In remembrace of my eternal love 
 My grace will always be enough 
 I will not forget you 
 Your fragile body that was slain 
 I will not forget you 
 The sacrifice of blood you gave 
 I will not forget you 
 And how your faithfulness remains 
 I wil not forget you 
 And how your love keeps me amazed

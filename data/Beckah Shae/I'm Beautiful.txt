The way He looks at me 
 The way He smiles 'cause I'm His 
 The way He cares for me 
 The way He gives me happiness 
 He thinks I'm lovely 
 Like a cherished rose 
 A diamond sparkling 
 The apple of His eye 
 He'd gladly give His life for mine 
 I'm so amazed by You, 
 You took away the ugly lie 
 And showed me the truth 
 Next to Him, I'm so small 
 He's so perfect, I'm so flawed 
 I'm so poor and He's the maker of all 
 He's the melody that makes my soul sing 
 He adores me, though I'm so unworthy 
 And I can say, I'm beautiful, 
 Because He sees me 
 I've never been so loved, 
 And I still comprehend how 
 Much more is enough 
 Cause all I know is what I feel right now 
 He overwhelms me 
 I laugh, I cry, I dance, I sing, I write 
 As if my body 
 Just can't contain all this praise inside 
 I'm so amazed by You 
 You took away the ugly lie 
 And showed me the truth 
 I never knew such pride could be found 
 Hidden here on my knees in humility 
 I'm confident you know me well 
 Just the way I am, and you still 
 You call me beautiful!

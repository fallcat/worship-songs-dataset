Imagine this 
 Joy and laughter and no more pain 
 Where love insists to be known 
 Imagine all the people 
 Caring for each other 
 Instead of all the fussing and arguing 
 I'm a dreamer, a believer 
 That there's hope within our reach 
 I'm going to take a stand and agree 
 The healing begins with me 
 There's a better way 
 We don't have to die anymore 
 Open up your eyes and see the need 
 We can make a difference with our own lives 
 If we let love arise from the inside 
 Heed the call and be all we were made to be 
 Imagine this 
 Safety and shelter from the storm 
 A place for all to call home 
 Imagine all the people 
 Learning that which matters most 
 Can't be bought or earned or taken 
 I'm a dreamer, a believer 
 That there's hope within our reach 
 I'm going to take a stand and agree 
 The healing begins with me 
 There's a better way 
 We don't have to die anymore 
 Open up your eyes and see the need 
 We can make a difference with our own lives 
 If we let love arise from the inside 
 Heed the call and be all we were made to be 
 Imagine if we were all rich 
 Imagine if we all knew peace 
 Imagine if we all gave love 
 The way that God gave love 
 We'd have so much more than enough 
 There's a better way 
 We don't have to die anymore 
 Open up your eyes and see the need 
 We can make a difference with our own lives 
 Just let love arise from the inside 
 Heed the call and be all we were made to be 
 Because there's a better way 
 We don't have to die anymore 
 Open up your eyes and see the need 
 We can make a difference with our own lives 
 Just let love arise from the inside 
 Heed the call and be all we were made to be

I see You in the rain, like crystal glistening 
 I see You in the Son, like a fire blazing 
 I look up into the sky at night and see Your Glory 
 I'm humbled by a newborn babies cry 
 So pure, You are Holy 
 There's no other way to better say 
 Hallelujah! You're Indescribable 
 Heaven and earth proclaim the glory of Your name 
 Hallelujah! You are so wonderful 
 Master, Creator, God 
 Hallelujah! You're indescribable 
 Awestruck by who You are 
 Hallelujah! You are so wonderful 
 I see You in the ocean, Your love is overflowing 
 I see You in the trees, dancing to the wind's melody 
 I look up to the mountains where the rocks cry and I see Your face 
 I'm taken by a rainbow in the sky 
 'Cause it reminds me that I am safe 
 There's no other way to better say 
 Hallelujah! You're Indescribable 
 Heaven and earth proclaim the glory of Your name 
 Hallelujah! You are so wonderful 
 Master, Creator, God 
 Hallelujah! You're indescribable 
 Awestruck by who You are 
 Hallelujah! You are so wonderful 
 All heaven and earth declare 
 Your glory everywhere 
 Baruch shem kivod leolam va'ed 
 None could compare 
 All creation cries out Your name 
 For Your worthy of all praise 
 Barukh attah adonai melekh m'hulal batishbachot 
 You're amazing 
 There's no other way to better say 
 Hallelujah! You're Indescribable 
 Heaven and earth proclaim the glory of Your name 
 Hallelujah! You are so wonderful 
 Master, Creator, God 
 Hallelujah! You're indescribable 
 Awestruck by who You are 
 Hallelujah! You are so wonderful

Where's your treasure? where's your heart? 
 So they say the more you possess is the more your blessed 
 But they're so far from the truth, there's so much more here to do 
 And believe me there's so much more in store for you 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 What's in your hands? where are your feet? 
 And what did you do with the trusted few he gave you to feed? 
 Or did you even see there was a need? 
 Did you neglect to do unto one of the least of these? 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 There's so much more to this life 
 You've got to believe, all and any of these material things 
 Don't have no worth where your gonna be 
 So don't lay things up for yourselves, where moths and thieves go 
 'Cause where your treasure is, there your heart is also 
 So let's invest in love 
 Do you ever wonder, just how you'd be 
 If you were born another place and time, maybe a third world country 
 Oh you see, everybody's got it just a little differently 
 There's a whole lot more to a person than the things you see 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 Now is the time to, give what you can 
 It's not how much you have, but how willing you are to stand 
 For the many souls, who never tasted 
 Who have never been given the choice 
 To experience his love and understand 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 If we could only just keep our eyes to the skies 
 This is how we know what love is 
 Jesus Christ comes to show us with his life 
 It's not enough to just love with words 
 But in deed and truth, let's let our actions be heard 
 Let's live to die, and die to live for all eternity 
 If only we could just believe 
 There's so much more to this life 
 You've got to believe, all and any of these material things 
 Don't have no worth where your gonna be 
 So don't lay things up for yourselves, where moths and thieves go 
 'Cause where your treasure is, there your heart is also 
 So let's invest in love

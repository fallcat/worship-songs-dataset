Let the earth be glad and let the heavens rejoice 
 Let the seas roar and let the trees of the forest shout for joy 
 Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing oh 
 For the lord has done great and mighty things 
 I ride on the clouds, above the earth 
 Like an eagle I fly, leaving behind all my concerns 
 'Cause I'm free, in your peace with your arms open wide 
 I run to you and you fill me inside 
 Joy, joy, joy (sweet resounding joy) 
 Joy, joy, joy (you are the song of my heart) 
 Joy, joy, joy (my strength comes from your joy) 
 Joy, joy, joy (you are the song of my heart) 
 Let your glory come down, mysteries unfold 
 Let your treasures be found, and let all your secrets be told 
 My radiance is found, when I seek your face 
 And I explode in praise, oh deep within my soul 
 I ride on the clouds, above the earth 
 Like an eagle I fly, leaving behind all my concerns 
 'Cause I'm free, in your peace with your arms open wide 
 I run to you and you fill me inside 
 Joy, joy, joy (sweet resounding joy) 
 Joy, joy, joy (you are the song of my heart) 
 Joy, joy, joy (my strength comes from your joy) 
 Joy, joy, joy (you are the song of my heart) 
 I am confident that even when 
 Trials and tribulations come, that you can 
 Turn it all around 'cause I'm never bound 
 By simple situations 
 I know that, even when I cry 
 Nothing's too hard for the most high 
 I just wanna shout to the nations 
 Just come with me and fly 
 Joy, joy, joy ('cause I'm free in your peace) 
 Joy, joy, joy (with your arms open wide) 
 Joy, joy, joy (I run to you) 
 Joy, joy, joy (you are the song of my heart)

I know what I want it's you 
 And I know what I need it's you 
 I wasn't always this sure of you it's true 
 But I came to know you well know you better 
 And now you're all I wanna know 
 You're the song my heart sings 
 And I'd give up everything 
 Just to know you better 
 This world has nothing for me I count it all as loss 
 Just to know you well 
 And I wanna feel your heartbeat 
 I'll be your hands and feet 
 Just to know you better 
 This world has nothing for me I count it all as loss 
 Just to know you well 
 I know there's more 
 To what I'm seein' to what I'm feelin' 
 And I know that you're 
 Bigger than my dreams greater than our needs 
 And no matter what I'm confident you are with me 
 And I know that I don't understand everything 
 But I know what I need it's you 
 You're the song my heart sings 
 And I'd give up everything 
 Just to know you better 
 This world has nothing for me I count it all as loss 
 Just to know you well 
 And I wanna feel your heartbeat 
 I'll be your hands and feet 
 Just to know you better 
 This world has nothing for me I count it all as loss 
 Just to know you well 
 My life means nothing to me 
 Unless I know you well 
 Willing to take the blow be accused abused or more 
 Whatever it takes I just wanna know 
 'Cause your grace amazes me 
 And your love oh how its saved me from myself 
 Now I can't help just to know 
 You're the song my heart sings 
 And I'd give up everything 
 Just to know you better 
 This world has nothing for me I count it all as loss 
 Just to know you well 
 And I wanna feel your heartbeat 
 I'll be your hands and feet 
 Just to know you better 
 This world has nothing for me I count it all as loss 
 Just to know you well

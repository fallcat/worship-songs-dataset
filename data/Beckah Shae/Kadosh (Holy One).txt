Sleepers arise 
 The darkness of the night is done, it is done 
 Oh, open your hopeful eyes 
 And shine for your light has come, has come 
 Your sin and shame has been replaced 
 By the dawn of redeeming grace 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 God's Son, oh, such great love you've shown to us 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 You have come, Emmanuel, Messiah 
 Choirs of Angels sing 
 Glory to the Lord most high, Hallelujah 
 As we receive the new born King 
 The way, the truth, the life 
 The image of love divine 
 Holding such humble mind 
 Came to set us free 
 If only we would believe 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 God's Son, oh, such great love you've shown to us 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 You have come, Emmanuel, Messiah 
 To behold the beauty of this precious King 
 Oh, heaven is declaring his love as we sing 
 A baby's come to save me and I am amazed 
 Forever grateful, I will worship you all of my days 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 God's Son, oh, such great love you've shown to us 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 You have come, Emmanuel, Messiah 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 God's Son, oh, such great love you've shown to us 
 Kadosh, Holy One 
 You have come, Emmanuel, Messiah

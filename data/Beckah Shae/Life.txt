Here I go, I'm, I'm on my way 
 With my love glasses on, glasses on 
 With my love glasses on 
 Here I go, I'm, I'm on my way 
 I see more clearly and I feel strong, feel strong 
 More, more, more, more, more 
 There's got to be so much more to this life, oh 
 My, my, my, my heart is racing 
 Just to know what it is like 
 Whoa, more than I could expect 
 Anticipate or imagine 
 I'm willing to believe 
 Amazing things are still happening 
 I'm gonna live the rich life 
 The full and blessed life 
 So if y'all know what I mean 
 Put your hands up and declare with me, yeah 
 Love in full effect, chaim 
 I'm gonna live the good life 
 Beautiful and glorious life 
 So if y'all know what I mean 
 Put your hands up and declare with me, yeah 
 Love in full effect, chaim 
 Here I go again on my mission 
 To give it all, give it all, all, give it, give it all, all 
 'Cause I'm aware that what I share 
 Will come back good measure 
 Pressed down, down, shaken together and running over 
 Life, life, life, life, life 
 Is whatever I receive it to be 
 Whoa, why, why, why, why 
 Not jump over doubt and dive into belief? 
 More than I could expect 
 Anticipate or imagine 
 Oh, I'm willing to believe 
 Amazing things are still happening 
 I'm gonna live the rich life 
 The full and blessed life 
 So if y'all know what I mean 
 Put your hands up and declare with me, yeah 
 Love in full effect, chaim 
 I'm gonna live the good life 
 Beautiful and glorious life 
 So if y'all know what I mean 
 Put your hands up and declare with me, yeah 
 Love in full effect, chaim 
 No eye has seen 
 Nor ear has heard 
 My faith is breathing only because 
 I hear these words 
 Exceeding and abundantly 
 More than we could even ask or think, whoa 
 Surpassing all human understanding 
 I've been given this amazing peace 
 I'm gonna live the rich life 
 The full and blessed life 
 So if y'all know what I mean 
 Put your hands up and declare with me, yeah 
 Love in full effect, chaim 
 I'm gonna live the good life 
 Beautiful and glorious life 
 So if y'all know what I mean 
 Put your hands up and declare with me, yeah 
 Love in full effect, chaim

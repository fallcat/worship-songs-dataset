This is the message of love 
 The name of my Father above 
 Unable to fully comprehend in this world 
 Countless ways to explain, still never enough 
 I just keep on pressin on 
 I just keep aimin for that mark 
 And I won't give up, the fight for love, it's all I live for, now and forever 
 Listen, 'cause I know 
 There's a way that seems right to a man 
 Too many people searching, empty, lonely, hurting 
 And everything seems crazy, did you ever think maybe? The cure is found in history's pages? 
 Oh and it has been written, that people are dying for lack of knowledge, or a stubborn sense of selfish expectations 
 Don't you know the carnal superficial minds will never find freedom beyond the natural eye 
 Famous Isaiah, Jewish Prophet, with few friends in your lifetime, you chose to remain by your God's side 
 This is what you said Oh (everybody's got to know this) 
 He did not appear beautiful or majestic 
 He was despised and rejected 
 As a man of sorrows, so oppressed, yet he never said a word 
 He had done no wrong yet he was led like a lamb to the slaughter 
 It's hard to understand 
 Everybody can't 
 Cause as high as the heavens 
 Are his ways higher than our ways 
 And his thoughts are higher than our ways 
 I believe in love, redemption sings us a love song of sweet salvation

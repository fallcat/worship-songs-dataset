(I realize Lord, Your connections are divine Lord, and for mothers, thank you for choosing mine, for, every time I think about how truly blessed I am to have her, my eyes begin to water, so proud to be her daughter, I can't imagine life without her, but I always know no matter, how alone I may feel, I'll make it through, because the greatest hope she gave me was You, so Lord, first and foremost I just wanna say thank you) 
 Late night lullabies 
 Eskimo kisses before saying goodbye, prayers before bedtime 
 Crying out Lord send your angels to never leave her side 
 And I remember all those things like they're a part of me 
 And without them momma, I don't know where I'd be 
 Because you were my inspiration 
 And I'm filled with admiration 
 For you, because, you could never give enough 
 Your selflessness, expressed to me true love 
 And everything I see in you is a reflection from above 
 I've watched your ways and I must say that I'm thankful 
 No one else could ever take your place 
 You are so beautiful 
 You sacrificed yourself for me 
 Believed in me 
 You mean the world to me 
 And all I can say is 
 Momma, I'm grateful 
 Working two jobs as a single mom 
 But always right there by my side 
 Even though you were gone 
 I know you had some struggles of your own to take 
 And some poor choices, you did make 
 But you need to know that can never change who I am 
 I am who I am because of the love that you gave 
 And all those times when I was away 
 You were my warrior 
 Through all the rough times I saw you pray 
 My faith grew stronger 
 And all of those times you told me to sing 
 From my heart 
 Songs fell from the stars 
 And I praise God for who you are

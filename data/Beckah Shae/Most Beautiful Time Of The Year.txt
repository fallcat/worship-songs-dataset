All around the world everybody's celebrating the Light 
 The One and only King of Kings who came to bring us everlasting life 
 Faith, hope and love are all words we hear 
 This time more than any other time of the year 
 Oh, peace and joy just to name a couple more 
 And friends and family all seem to gather near 
 This is the reason why, this is my favorite time 
 Angels on display and radios are playin' 
 Praises to Emmanuel, O Holy Night and First Noel 
 Christ is reignin and hearts are changing! 
 This is the most beautiful time of the year (not just cause the snow is fallin') 
 Smiles, laughter, joy, good tidings and cheer (not just cause your friends are callin) 
 And even though, Oh! Everyday I celebrate the reason for Christmas I still... 
 Just can't help myself from lovin' this, most beautiful time of the year! 
 All around the world everybody's celebrating a Love 
 The One and only Prince of Peace who came and gave us more than enough 
 Compassion and giving are all things we see 
 This time more than any other time of year 
 Gifts and charity for those in need 
 And church bells ring to come and hear the choirs sing

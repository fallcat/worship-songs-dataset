It fills the atmosphere 
 And whether or not you listen you still hear 
 Music... It has the power to take you somewhere 
 It fills the atmosphere 
 And whether or not you listen you still hear 
 Music... It has the power to take you somewhere 
 And we need a remedy for the insanity 
 We need a melody to help us believe 
 Let's start a fire revival 
 C'mon lets inspire we wanna go higher 
 Sounds that make my spirit dance like 
 I'm the only one here with you 
 Music... We need you, we need you 
 So c'mon give us good music 
 You can feel it in your soul 
 That beat drops and you find yourself just wanting more 
 Music... You're at its mercy soon as your feet touch the floor 
 And the rhythm is moving you 
 As the wisdom's fine tunin' you 
 Music... Ain't nothing better than a real hot track 
 With those lyrics that bring us back 
 And we need a remedy for the insanity 
 We need a melody to help us believe 
 Let's start a fire revival 
 C'mon lets inspire we wanna go higher 
 Sounds that make my spirit dance like 
 I'm the only one here with you 
 Music... We need you, we need you 
 So c'mon give us good music 
 Whatever happened to the way 
 We used to use music 
 It's just become so crazy the way 
 We choose to abuse it 
 It's time we come together 
 For love let's make it better 
 Let's raise the bar higher 
 With purpose we are driven 
 Let's make em' all wanna listen 
 So we gotta give em' what they're missin' 
 Holy spirit yeah 
 Sounds that make my spirit dance like 
 I'm the only one here with you 
 Music... We need you, we need you 
 So c'mon give us good music

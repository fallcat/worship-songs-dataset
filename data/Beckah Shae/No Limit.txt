So, there's always gonna be critics out there 
 You'll never go nowhere as long as you care 
 So ya gotta understand 
 There's gonna always be a man 
 Telling you that you can't 
 So, if you never spread your wings 
 You can't touch the sky 
 And you'll always wonder why 
 Because you never try 
 So are ya really gonna let someone else decide 
 Who you are and how far you were created to fly 
 (Fly) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 (No no no, no no no) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 (No no no, no no no) 
 Just who you are and how far you were meant to fly 
 (You are so wonderful... 
 Because you are so wonderful 
 (...And fearfully made) 
 And so fearfully made 
 Able to do all things great 
 (Your Maker has a ...) 
 Oh, you better know your Maker 
 (...Plan or purpose for you) 
 Cause He's gotta plan or purpose for you 
 And there's no limit to what together you can do 
 So you might even notice there's not a single one 
 Who agrees the things you seen and visions can be done 
 So you gotta realize 
 That the truth that makes you wise 
 Also makes your faith fly 
 So you just may be the one to listen and obey 
 Despite the dark nor the uncertainties 
 Significance is not built on what meets the eyes 
 Who you are and how far you were created to fly 
 There where always be haters like commentators who'll be carried away 
 Hey, There will always be somebody who got somethin' to say 
 Yo, don't be 'fraid or discouraged when your plans are good 
 'Cause Jesus said He opened doors that no man could shut 
 And it don't matter 'bout your status or mistakes you made in yo' past 
 If God be for ya He got ya back like a coat tag 
 Trust me, you can help that in Him there is no flack 
 You can drink from his fountain Zion's mountain with no cash 
 When your life is all smashed 
 But you in your room with a box a tissue Wipers 
 Sniffin', wishing for your tomb 
 But the sky is the limit 
 God knew you from the womb 
 He got your eye on the prize tryin' to give you the moon 
 So still back for a second and realize your purpose 
 Yeah, people gon' talk, but know God's plans are perfect 
 Well, Miss Shae's here to tell ya 
 When you're trying to cross an obstacle 
 Know that God is with you, 
 He will make it all possible. 
 (You are so wonderful... 
 Because you are so wonderful (you are so wonderful) 
 (...And fearfully made) 
 And so fearfully made 
 Able to do all things great 
 (Your Maker has a ...) 
 Oh, you better know your Maker (better know your maker) 
 (...Plan or purpose for you) 
 Cause He's gotta a plan or purpose for you (for you) 
 And there's no limit to what together you can do (what together you can do) 
 (You are so wonderful... 
 Because you are so wonderful 
 (...And fearfully made) 
 And so fearfully made 
 Able to do all things great 
 (Your Maker has a ...) 
 Oh, you better know your Maker 
 (...Plan or purpose for you) 
 Cause He's gotta plan or purpose for you 
 And there's no limit to what together you can do (what together you can do)

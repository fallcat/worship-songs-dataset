Get behind me I'm comin' through, I'm armed and dangerous 
 I'm like an army that's fed up with you, commanding you must 
 Get out my way and go back to where you came from 
 Oh! Go! I'm telling you, no more! 
 I'm sick and tired of all you're lies, nothing you say could make me 
 Agree with you, I know the truth, nothing you do could brake me 
 You just don't know who your messin with, I'm a warrior 
 Oh! Go! I'm telling you, no more! 
 The weapons of my warfare, they are not carnal 
 The victory is mine 
 I'm taking back everything at least 7 times 
 I raise my sword 
 And make you wish you never even tried 
 I'm telling you, No More! 
 All your attempts are only making me stronger 
 Your strategy ain't foolin me any longer 
 I see you loud and clear 
 You can't hide, but you can run 
 Oh! Go! I'm telling you, no more! 
 You best be leavin' now, 'cause I'm about to bring some glory 
 You lose, and thanks again for giving me an awesome story 
 You just don't know who you're messin with, I'm a warrior 
 Oh! No! I'm telling you no more! 
 I'm not afraid, 'cause I'm not alone 
 So be on your way, 
 There's nothing here for you, the battle's already won 
 Ain't worth my time, I ain't messin with you no more 
 You've been defeated under my feet, crushed on the floor 
 You ain't done nothing but make me a better warrior! 
 So I'm telling you, no more!

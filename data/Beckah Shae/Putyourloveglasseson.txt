I see you lookin' lookin' like you wanna dance, I'm watchin wonderin why you don't take the chance? 
 Go ahead and take His hand. What are you scared of man? What are you scared of? Man? 
 I know you got it in you, Now just let it out. Don't miss the moment, this is what it's all about. 
 Its everywhere, look around, So many treasures to be found. 
 So we gotta, keep truth seeking, listen to wisdom speaking, catch his heartbeat and Abide Abide Abide 
 Keep truth seeking, listen to wisdom speaking, catch his heartbeat and see the world through Gods eyes! 
 Put, Put your, Put your love, Love, love 
 Put your, put your love, love 
 Put your love glasses on, Glasses on 
 Can you feel it, its in the air, Its how we choose to breathe. People treatin eachother either with honor or jealousy. 
 Rude rude, cutin others down 'cause they ain't what you think you need. 
 Truth is we all need one another, Some are just too prideful to see. 
 God give us grace to see all things, To see man's heart the way You see 
 Gotta get get get that vision (love vision) vision oh 
 Love bears all things believes all things, Hopes in all things endures in all things 
 So we gotta get that vision!

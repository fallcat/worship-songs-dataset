I'ma go there got no fear I'm not scared no 
 Revelation come I wanna know why I'm 
 Watchin' what I'm watchin' 
 Hearin' what I'm hearin' 
 Doin' what I'm doin' 
 Consuming what I'm consuming 
 All the fishies swimming in the same direction 
 All swallowin' followin' with no hesitation 
 Buyin' what they're buyin' 
 Wearin' what they're wearin' 
 Lovin' what they're lovin' 
 Goin' where everyone's goin' 
 Where are all the questions 
 In a world of mystery 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 With both eyes open I won't sleep 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 I can hear it on the stereo see it on the telly 
 Oh no I won't be deceived 
 Illuminate the truth to me 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 There everywhere signs symbols 
 Open up your eyes 'cause there ain't much time 
 Till we're gonna go home 
 So watch what you're watchin' 
 Hear what you're hearin' 
 Do what you're doin' 
 And know what you're consuming 
 Ignorance ain't bliss when you're standin' in the fire 
 There's a way that seems ok 
 Don't die by a liar 
 So don't buy what they're buyin' 
 Care what their wearin' 
 Love how they're lovin' 
 And don't go where everyone's goin' 
 Where are all the questions 
 In a world of mystery 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 With both eyes open I won't sleep 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 I can hear it on the stereo see it on the telly 
 Oh no I won't be deceived 
 Illuminate the truth to me 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 You are life 
 So open up my eyes 
 You are mine Jesus 
 And I will seek until I find 
 The whole truth 
 So you won't see me fallin' 
 For nothing but you 
 'Cause you are the truth 
 In a world of mystery 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 With both eyes open I won't sleep 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me 
 I can hear it on the stereo see it on the telly 
 Oh no I won't be deceived 
 Illuminate the truth to me 
 I'ma keep searchin' till you show me

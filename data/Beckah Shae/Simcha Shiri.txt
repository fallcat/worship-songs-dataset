Sweet angel baby, how you make me 
 Melt inside with every look for your pretty eyes 
 Oh how he gave me, something so amazing 
 My love is yours for all time 
 I pray you would have eyes to see 
 And always be covered in peace 
 Supernatural, strength, wisdom 
 Knowledge and understanding 
 You gotta know, you already have the keys 
 To the kingdom if you believe 
 His love for you is everlasting 
 And blessed our lives, in such a beautiful way 
 You are a diamond and the apple of our eye 
 A masterpiece and so precious in our sight 
 Don't forget who you are 
 A heavenly song, straight from god's heart 
 You are royalty, a daughter of the king 
 And you will always be my simcha shiri 
 Sweet love from above, there's never enough 
 Ways to say how thankful I am you came 
 And yet, my only aim, is to help you remain in 
 That perfect secret place 
 You may not always understand why 
 We make decisions you don't like 
 But there's one thing you should know and just hold tight to 
 Our love for you is so great 
 To protect and just keep you safe 
 Is all we really want to do 
 Simcha shiri, fruit of the spirit and my womb 
 So soon I knew that you were 
 The joy he sent to me 
 To make my life complete 
 Oh I see heaven in your eyes 
 And your smile it brings the sunshine 
 No one could ever take your place 
 One of a kind, sweet reflection of his beautiful grace

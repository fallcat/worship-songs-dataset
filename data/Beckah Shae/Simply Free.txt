Sitting contemplating these images in my mind 
 Making sure that everything is stylistically right 
 Overwhelmed, now I know why I'm tired 
 'Cause this place's superficial expectations are way too high 
 So why is everyone always tryin' to be 
 Everything this world tells us we ought to be 
 You know I'm just gonna keep my song simple now 
 'Cause I don't really need to try and be deep 
 And who decided what clothes look good on me? 
 And would it even matter if I disagreed? 
 You know I'm just gonna keep my style simple now 
 With something cozy, maybe even bare feet 
 'Cause I'm free, free to be 
 Everything he made me to be 
 I'm free, from the world and me 
 Depressing awareness, that I couldn't even measure up 
 No matter how hard I tried, I could never be enough 
 Tryin' on my own, to fulfill a law 
 That's already been fulfilled for me 
 So why we gotta try to hold on tight 
 To the old ways when there's been a sacrifice? 
 The curse has been erased for you and me 
 So there's no need for empty religiosity 
 And why must I be bound by all the limits set 
 The human eye decides is far as I can get? 
 You know I'm just gonna keep on running, to the unseen 
 Accepted and beloved, 'cause in him I know that I am 
 'Cause I'm free, free to be 
 Everything he made me to be 
 I'm free, from the world and me 
 Beautifully chosen, adopted as his child 
 I have been redeemed and made complete in him all the while 
 Knowing that I'll never be the same 
 I am a significant, magnificent creation 
 Presented pure and holy and worthy of 
 A love that I could never comprehend enough 
 I am made a royal priest, sitting in the heavenlies 
 And I can do all things through Christ who gives me 
 The strength it takes to die so I can live 
 I have been anointed, established and sealed by him 
 Oh, can't you feel the peace it just makes me wanna sing 
 'Cause I'm free, free to be 
 Everything he made me to be 
 I'm free, from the world and me

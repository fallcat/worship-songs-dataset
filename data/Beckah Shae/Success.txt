So you're a superstar, a celebrity, a big name 
 So you think you're somebody now 
 And you got it all figured out 
 Ritzy, swankiness and all that flair 
 You gotta style that'll knock 'em out 
 You got followers everywhere, 
 And admirers just tryin' to figure it out 
 So you're something, someone, you've made it now 
 Achieved all you've dreamed, what's left now 
 But what if your aim was to attain more than you could gain in this world? 
 And what if your heart chose to just trust 
 The one who made everything in this world? 
 What does success really mean? 
 Doesn't really have much to do with me 
 It's my will, conformed to your will 
 Full of joy, peace and prosperity 
 What does success really mean 
 Doesn't really have much to do with me 
 Faithfulness and contentment is all I need 
 You are my success 
 Oh just another one of those days 
 Just like the last, they all seem the same 
 Feels like routine has got you bound 
 And ambition just can't be found 
 Oh, and the harder you work you wonder why, 
 Your only just getting by 
 Seeming like you just can't please no one 
 No matter how much you try 
 So you're on one, no where, unrecoginized 
 So you keep to yourself, this is your life 
 But what if your aim was to attain more than you could gain in this world? 
 And what if your heart chose to just trust 
 The one who made everything in this world? 
 What does success really mean? 
 Doesn't really have much to do with me 
 It's my will, conformed to your will 
 Full of joy, peace and prosperity 
 What does success really mean 
 Doesn't really have much to do with me 
 Faithfulness and contentment is all I need 
 You are my success 
 So you better think, whose example do you wanna follow? 
 Where and what are your goals? 
 Where and who are your heroes? 
 So you better know, your not promised another tomorrow 
 So take a look through god's eyes 
 Your success is measured by 
 His grace and your faith so 
 But what if your aim was to attain more than you could gain in this world? 
 And what if your heart chose to just trust 
 The one who made everything in this world? 
 What does success really mean? 
 Doesn't really have much to do with me 
 It's my will, conformed to your will 
 Full of joy, peace and prosperity 
 What does success really mean 
 Doesn't really have much to do with me 
 Faithfulness and contentment is all I need 
 You are my success

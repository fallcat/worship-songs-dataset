We're all just in a race for what is and what could be, 
 Do you believe? 
 We're all just wanting something more than we can see, 
 And you can if you believe. 
 I've got a real mean agenda for my opposer, 
 Ain't gettin' nothing from me but an, "I thought I told ya!" 
 I've got a clear conscience and it's leading me over the doubt, 
 And I'ma bust out, like a supernova! 
 Shine! Just like a super star, 
 So bright, lightin up the night 
 Supernova 
 Shine! Just like a super star, 
 Outshining galaxies like a supernova! 
 There ought to be a glow about our lives 
 Radiating beauty from our God, coming from the inside. 
 We all know what it's like to live the night life, 
 Mixin' wrong with right, and it leads to nothing but a dead life. 
 Shine! Just like a super star, 
 So bright, lightin up the night 
 Supernova 
 Shine! Just like a super star, 
 Outshining galaxies like a supernova! 
 All glory, honor and power forever! 
 Yeshua! To you all, 
 Glory, honor and power forever! 
 Shine! Just like a super star, 
 So bright, lightin up the night 
 Supernova 
 Shine! Just like a super star, 
 Outshining galaxies like a supernova!

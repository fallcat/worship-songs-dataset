Calling everybody are you ready for the battle 
 We laugh at fear covered by the king's shadow 
 All my soldiers All my warriors 
 Risk takers and history makers 
 Freedom fighters Planet shakers 
 Let's unite and shout a war cry 
 We are the revolution 
 This a love revolution 
 With love vision 
 We're on a mission and we ain't playin' 
 'Cause we goin' do what we say 
 Now watch that standard raise 
 While we keep prayin' 
 We are the revolution 
 This a love revolution 
 We're gonna make a change for the better 
 We gonna stay bowed down till we all stand together 
 We chase fear away with our faith 
 We're gonna switch it up and take it a bit higher 
 We're gonna give up so much more than what's required 
 We chase hate away with this with his love 
 We are the revolution 
 This a love revolution

So long, I've hoped for you 
 So far, no one compares to you 
 You got me dancing like a fool when I'm alone in my room 
 You have me shoutin Halleluiah 
 Just when I think about ya 
 You got me loopy like a rollercoaster baby 
 And I'm hangin' on 
 You got me skippin like a record baby 
 To my favorite song 
 You are the one 
 Who surpasses all my expectations 
 My search is done 
 So I'm gonna have myself a celebration 
 You are more than I could have ever asked for 
 I've never been more sure, this love 
 Is so worth waiting for 
 I know my prayers can be answered 
 You've proved dreams do really come true 
 You are what I never, knew I always wanted 
 It's so incredible, the better thing that comes from trusting 
 I've held patience's hand, You've made me a fan 
 It's so wonderful, to be in God's perfect plan 
 Oh I know I am blessed! 
 And I know I would wait for you all over again!

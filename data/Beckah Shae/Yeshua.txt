Why is it thought to be incredible by 
 Any of you that God could raise the dead? 
 And who among us is putting our confidence in, 
 All these fleshly earthly promises? 
 And why can't we simply just open up our eyes? 
 Cause love extends far more than words. 
 And what if there was so much more to this life, 
 On behalf of this famous name you've heard? 
 Yeshua is his name. 
 Believe or deny him, 
 You just know there's something about that name. 
 Yeshua is His name. 
 Yeshua Ha'Mashiach! 
 I'm convinced neither death nor life, 
 Nor angels or principalities, Oh, not nothing. 
 Not any fears for today or worries about tomorrow, 
 Nor any power in the sky above or earth below. 
 Oh nothing in all creation could separate us from Gods love. 
 Through the blood of His son, Yeshua. 
 Who is this anointed one, many times fore told? 
 Who came in righteousness and power? 
 Who claims all our sins have all been atoned? 
 As he took his last breathe in the ninth hour. 
 No longer bound by law because He loved us all. 
 There isn't a thing we could do, 
 To receive this grace He freely gave, 
 But believe by faith that this love is true. 
 Yeshua is his name. 
 Believe or deny him, 
 You just know there's something about that name. 
 Yeshua is His name. 
 Yeshua Ha'Mashiach! 
 I'm convinced neither death nor life, 
 Nor angels or principalities, Oh, not nothing. 
 Not any fears for today or worries about tomorrow, 
 Nor any power in the sky above or earth below. 
 Oh nothing in all creation could separate us from Gods love. 
 Through the blood of His son, Yeshua. 
 I don't know why, 
 You would deny a Love so excellent! 
 Maybe you've seen or heard his name or Word 
 Associated with your enemies. 
 That's not Him! Don't be deceived. 
 Open your eyes, dry bones come Alive, 
 This truth is for you! 
 Maybe you've heard He's just a man a teacher, 
 Prophet, and not the Savior. 
 That's not him! Please! If you would just believe! 
 Yeshua is his name. 
 Believe or deny him, 
 You just know there's something about that name. 
 Yeshua is His name. 
 Yeshua Ha'Mashiach! 
 I'm convinced neither death nor life, 
 Nor angels or principalities, Oh, not nothing. 
 Not any fears for today or worries about tomorrow, 
 Nor any power in the sky above or earth below. 
 Oh nothing in all creation could separate us from Gods love. 
 Through the blood of His son, Yeshua.

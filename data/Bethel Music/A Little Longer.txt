What can I do for You 
 What can I bring to You 
 What kind of song would You like me to sing 
 'Cause I'll dance a dance for You 
 Pour out my love for You 
 What can I do for You beautiful King 
 'Cause I can't thank You enough 
 'Cause I can't thank You enough 
 What can I do for You 
 What can I bring to You 
 What kind of song would You like me to sing 
 'Cause I'll dance a dance for You 
 Pour out my love for You 
 What can I do for You beautiful King 
 Then I hear You say 
 You don't have to do a thing 
 Simply be with Me and let those things go 
 They can wait another minute 
 Wait this moment is too sweet 
 Please stay here with me 
 And love on Me a little longer 
 'Cause I'm in love with you 
 So I'll wait here at Your feet 
 It's where I want to be 
 Your voice I'll follow 
 Jesus You are everything to me 
 And I'll pour out my life 
 Worship at Your feet 
 Love on You a little longer 
 'Cause I'm in love with You

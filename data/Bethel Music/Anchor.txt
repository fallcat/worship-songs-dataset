In every season, in every change 
 You are near 
 In every sorrow, You are my strength 
 You are near 
 A peace in the storm 
 Your voice I will follow 
 In weakness I rise 
 Remembering You hold my world 
 I'm holding on to hope 
 I'm holding on to grace 
 I'm fully letting go 
 I'm surrendered to Your ways 
 The anchor for my soul 
 Father You will never change 
 I love You, I love You 
 My great Redeemer, 
 My constant Friend 
 You are near 
 My faithful Father, You took me in 
 You are near 
 I will remember Your promise forever 
 My Strength, my Defender 
 I can count on You 
 You are my Savior, My Hope and my Shelter 
 Your love is forever 
 I can count on You

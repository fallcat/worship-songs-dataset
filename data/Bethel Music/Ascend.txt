Come let us see our Lord and King 
 He's reigning in glory 
 Lift up your eyes, all earth and skies 
 His kingdom is coming 
 From glory to glory 
 We will arrive 
 We will ascend the hill of the Lord 
 We will declare His holy word 
 With clean hands and pure hearts 
 With clean hands and pure hearts 
 We will see God 
 We fix our eyes, we give our lives 
 Our hope is in Heaven 
 So let us run, we have overcome 
 Now and forever 
 When we see Him we'll be like Him 
 Face to face we'll know what love is

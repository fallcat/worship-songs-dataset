We've come to join the song 
 Sung long before our lives 
 To raise our voice along 
 Heaven and Earth alike 
 And we've seen Your faithful hand 
 Your mercy without end 
 A King who bled and died 
 A God who sacrificed 
 Be enthroned upon the praises of 
 A thousand generations 
 You are worthy Lord of all 
 Unto You the slain and risen King 
 We lift our voice with Heaven 
 Singing worthy Lord of all 
 All through this life we lead 
 And on to eternity 
 Our endless praise will cry 
 Jesus be glorified 
 All through this life we lead 
 And on to eternity 
 Our endless praise will cry 
 Jesus be glorified 
 Jesus be glorified 
 Be enthroned upon the praises of 
 A thousand generations 
 You are worthy Lord of all 
 Unto You the slain and risen King 
 We lift our voice with Heaven 
 Singing worthy Lord of all 
 Be enthroned upon the praises of 
 A thousand generations 
 You are worthy Lord of all 
 Unto You the slain and risen King 
 We lift our voice with Heaven 
 Singing worthy Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Highest praises 
 Lord of all 
 Be enthroned upon the praises of 
 A thousand generations 
 You are worthy Lord of all 
 Unto You the slain and risen King 
 We lift our voice with Heaven 
 Singing worthy Lord of all

Be lifted high 
 Be lifted high 
 For Your glory, be lifted high 
 You're the King of all the ages 
 You're the author of salvation 
 You're the reason why we're singing for Your glory 
 Lord release the sound of Heaven 
 Let it rise in every nation 
 We will join the anthem singing 
 You're the everlasting Father 
 You're the all consuming fire 
 You're the reason why we're living for Your glory 
 We will be the generation 
 Calling down the reign of Heaven 
 We will join the anthem singing 
 Be lifted high Be lifted high higher and higher Lord 
 Be lifted high Be lifted high higher and higher Lord

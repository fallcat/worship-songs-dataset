Be still my heart and know, You are God alone 
 Stop thinking so much, And just let go 
 Be still my soul and rest, Humbly I confess 
 In my weakness, Your strength is perfect 
 For You alone are God, There will be no other 
 And You have won my heart, more than any other 
 So I will give it all, 'Cause You gave it all for me 
 "Bless the Lord," Oh my soul cries out 
 All that is within me praise 
 "Bless the Lord," Oh my soul cries out 
 All that is within me praise

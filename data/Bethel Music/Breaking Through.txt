Your love is like a sunrise 
 Shattering the dark of night 
 Your presence is a paradise, to our hearts 
 You're filling all the world with light 
 You're making every wrong thing right 
 You're waking up the dead to life, in Your love 
 God You're always breaking through the dark 
 Breaking into lives and healing hearts 
 Your love has torn the veil 
 Your love can never fail 
 Your love is making all things new 
 Your love is an eternal fire 
 A jealous and a pure desire 
 Strong enough to be the sacrifice, that set us free 
 You have taken all our sins away 
 You have risen and You've won the day 
 You have broken every bond and chain, in Your love 
 So we lift up one voice, we lift up a voice 
 We sing and we shout for joy 
 For now we are Yours, yes our hearts are Yours 
 You've ransomed us with Your blood

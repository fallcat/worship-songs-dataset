Oh oh oh 
 You are hear right now 
 You are hear right now 
 I can see your smiling face 
 With pride in your eyes 
 We are your children 
 I breath you in, and I breath you out 
 I breath you in, right here and now 
 Cause worship is connection 
 Worship is connection 
 We are not just singing to the sky 
 Worship is connection 
 Oh oh oh 
 We are singing to the one who has been singing over us this whole time 
 Worship is connection 
 Worship is connection 
 We are not just singing to the sky 
 We are returning the live song 
 To the one who has been 
 Singing to us this whole time

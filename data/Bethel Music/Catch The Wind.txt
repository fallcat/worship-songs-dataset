I am strong and full of life 
 I am steadfast, no compromise 
 I lift my sails to the sky 
 I'm gonna catch the wind, I'm gonna catch the wind 
 I am bold, no fear inside 
 Spread my wings, open my life 
 Like an eagle, whose home is the sky 
 I'm gonna catch the wind, I'm gonna catch the wind 
 Your faithfulness will never let me down 
 I'm confident I'll see Your goodness now 
 I know You hear my heart, I'm singing out 
 There's nothing that can stop Your goodness now 
 Like standing on the edge of a mountainside 
 I can feel the wind stirring, lifting me up high 
 I was born into freedom, I was made to fly 
 I am strong and full of life 
 I am steadfast, no compromise 
 I lift my sails to the sky 
 I'm gonna catch the wind

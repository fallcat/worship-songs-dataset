You hide, I want to find you 
 Go, and I will follow you 
 I want to be where you are 
 As You move, I'm right beside you, love 
 Oh, I'm running after you 
 I want to be where You are 
 I'm Chasing You, I'm so in love 
 Captivated, I just can't get enough 
 I'll spend my days, Running after Your heart 
 Your heart, Your heart, Whoa 
 I'm Chasing You, with all my love 
 Captivated, I just can't get enough 
 I'll spend my days, Running after Your heart 
 Your heart, Your heart, Whoa 
 Heart, You've won me heart and soul 
 And where You lead I'll go 
 I want to be where You are 
 From the moment I rise to the moment I sleep 
 My affection is for you, and even as I dream 
 I want to know you, I'm after Your heart 
 This life, this love, was always meant to be 
 A wild, crazy adventure discovering 
 The thrill, the rush, the more of You I see 
 The more it leaves me wanting 
 You're everything 
 You're everything

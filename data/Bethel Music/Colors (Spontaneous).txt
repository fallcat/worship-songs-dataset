Only You and You alone 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 When You walk in the room 
 You make all things new 
 When You walk into the room 
 Would You walk into the room 
 Would You walk into the room 
 Would You walk into the room, yeah 
 Would You walk into the room 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Wipe away the dullness 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Would You walk into the room 
 You make all things new 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Wipe away the dullness 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Your vibrancy 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Bring Your color in my life 
 Would You walk into the room 
 Would You walk into the room

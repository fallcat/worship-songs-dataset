Like a fire in the night 
 Who's flames reach and touch the sky 
 Burn within my soul and mind 
 Till all I see are Your eyes 
 Like the dawn takes back the light 
 Like Your Son brought back to life 
 Resurrect my soul's desire 
 To burn again with true love's fire 
 With true love's fire 
 Lord God come awaken love 
 Come stir my soul to long for all You are 
 I'm desperate just to have more of Your heart 
 Come awaken love 
 'Cause I live to love You 
 Almighty God of love 
 And my desire is to know you 
 And give you all my heart 
 Lord God come awaken love 
 Come stir my soul to long for all You are 
 I'm desperate just to have more of Your heart 
 Come awaken love

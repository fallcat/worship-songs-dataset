I am the Lord your God, I go before you now 
 I stand beside you, I'm all around you 
 Though you feel I'm far away 
 I'm closer than your breath 
 I am with you, more than you know 
 I am the Lord your peace, no evil will conquer you 
 Steady now your heart and mind, come into My rest 
 Oh, let your faith arise, lift up your weary head 
 I am with you wherever you go 
 Come to Me, I'm all you need 
 Come to Me, I'm everything 
 Come to Me, I'm all you need 
 Come to Me, I'm your everything 
 I am your anchor, in the wind and the waves 
 I am your steadfast, so don't be afraid 
 Though your heart and flesh may fail you 
 I'm your faithful strength 
 I am with you wherever you go

I've got a river of living water 
 A fountain that never will run dry 
 It's open heavens we're releasing 
 And we will never be denied 
 'Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells, 
 We're stirring up deep deep waters 
 We're going to dance in the river, dance in the river 
 'Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells, 
 We're stirring up deep deep waters 
 We're going to jump in the river, 
 Jump in and everybody singing now 
 Deep cries out to deep cries out to 
 Deep cries out to deep cries out to 
 So we cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus 
 We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to You 
 We're walking into deeper waters, going after You 
 If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left, 
 If He goes to the right then we'll go to the right 
 We're going Jump Jump Jump Jump in the river, 
 Jump Jump Jump Jump everybody. 
 We're going to Dance Dance, Dance Dance in the river, 
 Dance Dance, Dance Dance Everybody 
 We're going to Shout Shout Shout in the river, 
 Shout Shout Shout in the river Everybody

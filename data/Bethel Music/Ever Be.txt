Your love is devoted 
 Like a ring of solid gold 
 Like a vow that is tested 
 Like a covenant of old 
 And Your love is enduring 
 Through the winter rain 
 And beyond the horizon 
 With mercy for today 
 Faithful You have been 
 And faithful you will be 
 You pledge yourself to me 
 And it’s why I sing 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 You Father the orphan 
 Your kindness makes us whole 
 And You shoulder our weakness 
 And Your strength becomes our own 
 Now You’re making me like you 
 Clothing me in white 
 Bringing beauty from ashes 
 For You will have Your bride 
 Free of all her guilt 
 And rid of all her shame 
 And known by her true name 
 And it’s why I sing 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 And You will be praised 
 And You will be praised 
 With angels and saints 
 We sing worthy are You, Lord 
 And You will be praised 
 And You will be praised 
 With angels and saints 
 We sing worthy are You, Lord 
 And You will be praised 
 And You will be praised 
 With angels and saints 
 We sing worthy are You, Lord 
 And You will be praised 
 And You will be praised 
 With angels and saints 
 We sing worthy are You, Lord 
 And it's why I sing 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 Your praise will ever be on my lips 
 Ever be on my lips 
 And ever be on my lips

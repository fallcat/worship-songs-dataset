You placed the stars into motion 
 You called to the light and it came into place 
 Every detail of our beings You created 
 And like a good Father You will take care 
 You hold my being 
 You wrap Yourself around every detail of my life 
 You placed everything into motion 
 And all I have to do is stand in the palm of Your hand 
 'Cause I mean everything to You 
 'Cause I mean everything to You 
 You wrap yourself around me oh... 
 You hold me together in Your hand 
 When I'm feeling that I'm falling apart and I'm everywhere 
 You hold me now 
 'Cause I mean everything to You 
 I mean everything to You 
 And You mean everything to me 
 And You mean everything to me 
 I bare my soul completely before You 
 All I am, all I am is Yours 
 'Cause You mean everything to me 
 Everything in this whole world

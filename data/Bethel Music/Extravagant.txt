You were a lover before time's beginning 
 You gave Your love freely withholding nothing 
 Jesus, my Jesus 
 You carried the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You stopped at nothing to prove You were for us 
 Jesus, my Jesus 
 It's extravagant it doesn't make sense 
 We'll never comprehend the way You love us 
 It's unthinkable only Heaven knows 
 Just how far You'd go to say You love us 
 To say You love us 
 To say You love us 
 You don't belittle our pain and our suffering 
 You comfort us in our greatest unraveling 
 Jesus, my Jesus 
 You are the dawn that is breaking within me 
 You are the sun that is rising around me 
 Jesus, my Jesus 
 Here is all my love, it's Yours 
 No conditions 
 When You pull me close 
 I won't resist it 
 I won't resist it 
 I won't resist it 
 I won't resist it 
 I won't resist it

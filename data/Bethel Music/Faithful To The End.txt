We're heaven spun creations 
 His pride and adoration 
 Treasures woven by His love 
 His careful hands they hold us 
 Safe within His promise 
 Of calling and of destiny 
 I will sing of all You've done 
 I'll remember how far You carried me 
 From beginning until the end 
 You are faithful, faithful to the end 
 A Father's heart that's for me 
 A never-ending story 
 Of love that's always chasing me 
 His kindness overwhelming 
 And hope for me unending 
 He's never given up on me 
 There wasn't a day that you weren't by my side 
 There wasn't a day, that You let me fall 
 And all of my life, Your love has been true 
 And with all of my life I will worship you

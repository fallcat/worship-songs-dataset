The life You gave 
 Your body was broken 
 Your love poured out 
 You bled and You died for me 
 There on that cross 
 You breathed Your last as you were crucified 
 You gave it all for me 
 Hallelujah, what a Savior 
 Hallelujah, what a friend 
 Hallelujah, King forever 
 We thank You for the cross 
 There in the ground 
 Sealed in the darkness 
 Lifeless laid 
 The frame of the Father's son 
 In agony 
 He watched His only Son be sacrificed 
 He gave it all for me, yeah 
 Hallelujah, what a Savior 
 Hallelujah, what a friend 
 Hallelujah, King forever 
 We thank You for the cross 
 But on that day 
 What seemed as the darkest hour 
 A violent hope 
 Broke through and shook the ground 
 And as You rose 
 Oh, the Light of all the world was magnified 
 As You rose in victory 
 Hallelujah, it is finished 
 Hallelujah, it is done 
 Hallelujah King forever 
 And we thank you for the cross 
 Hallelujah, it is finished 
 Hallelujah, it is done 
 Hallelujah King forever 
 And we thank you for the cross, yeah 
 Oh, we thank You for the cross, yeah 
 Oh, my sins are forgiven, oh 
 You paid the ransom for me 
 Though our sins are scarlet 
 You have made us white as snow 
 Though our sins are scarlet 
 You have made us white as snow

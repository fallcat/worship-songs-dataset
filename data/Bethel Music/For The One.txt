Let me be filled 
 With kindness and compassion for the one 
 The one for whom You loved and gave Your Son 
 For humanity increase my love 
 Help me to love with open arms like You do 
 A love that erases all the lines and sees the truth 
 Oh that when they look in my eyes they would see You 
 Even in just a smile they would feel the Father's love 
 Oh how You love us 
 From the homeless to the famous and in-between 
 You formed us, You made us carefully 
 'Cause in the end, we're all Your children 
 Let all my life tell of who You are 
 And the wonder of Your never-ending love 
 Let all my life tell of who you are 
 You're wonderful and such a good Father

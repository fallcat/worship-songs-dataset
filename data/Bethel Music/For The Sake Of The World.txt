I'm laying down my life 
 I'm giving up control 
 I'm never looking back 
 I surrender all 
 I'm living for Your glory on the earth 
 This passion in my heart 
 This stirring in my soul 
 To see the nations bow 
 For all the world to know 
 I'm living for Your glory on the earth 
 For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me 
 Light a flame in my soul for every eye to see 
 For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me 
 For every knee to bow down 
 For every heart to believe 
 For every voice to cry out 
 Burn like a fire in me 
 For every tongue to confess 
 You alone are the King 
 You are the hope of the earth 
 Burn like a fire in me

I was afraid Your love set me free 
 I was in debt You paid the price for me 
 I was hurt You took away my pain 
 I was alone until You called my name 
 I was broken and You mended me 
 Before I was You loved me 
 You healed my body and You made me whole 
 No matter what I do You don't let go 
 I will sing to the King 
 I am the ransomed one 
 How I love Your holy name 
 Holy to the Lamb who was slain 
 When I laugh and when I cry 
 You are the reason why 
 How I long to be with You 
 Forever and a day 
 When I go to bed You are near 
 When I wake up You are there 
 When I play guitar You here 
 When I walk in faith You're everywhere 
 You catch and save every tear I cry 
 You journal everyday all about my life 
 Your love for me reaches to the sky 
 I am Yours You are mine 
 I was ashamed, 
 You called me beautiful 2x 
 Now I'm yours, 
 You called me beautiful 2x

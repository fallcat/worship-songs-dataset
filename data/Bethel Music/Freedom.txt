You came to set the captives free 
 You came to bring us liberty 
 My sin and my rejection 
 Your blood and my acceptance 
 Now I'm alive to bring You praise 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom 
 Every chain is broken through You, Jesus 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom 
 Whoa oh, oh, oh 
 Your blood has covered every sin 
 Your grace empowers me to win 
 My pain and my oppression met 
 Your blood and my acceptance 
 Now I'm alive to bring You praise 
 I'm free I'm free, I'm free to dance and sing 
 I'm free, I'm free, I'm free to shout it out 
 I'm free, I'm free, I'm free to dance and sing 
 I'm free, I'm free, I'm free to worship You 
 I'm gonna worship you

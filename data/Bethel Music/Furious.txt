Nothing can tear us from 
 The grip of His mighty love 
 We've only glimpsed, His vast affection 
 Heard whispers of, His heart and passion 
 It's pouring down... 
 His love is deep, His love is wide 
 And it covers us 
 His love is fierce, His love is strong 
 It is furious 
 His love is sweet, His love is wild 
 And it's waking hearts to life 
 The Father loves and sends His son 
 The Son lays down His life for all 
 He lavishes His love upon us 
 He calls us now, His sons and daughters 
 He's reaching out... 
 ... And its waking hearts to life 
 He is waking hearts to life 
 He is waking hearts to life

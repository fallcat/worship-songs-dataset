Created from dust 
 You came and You lived among us 
 You took on our frame 
 You walked in our pain 
 And now You're taking us higher 
 You stepped into time 
 You laid down Your life to save us 
 You took all our shame 
 On the cross it was laid 
 And now You're taking us higher 
 We go from glory to glory to glory 
 We'll never be the same 
 We'll never be the same 
 We go from glory to glory to glory 
 We're forever changed 
 Forever changed 
 You call me Your friend 
 Brought into Your endless kingdom 
 By the blood I was made 
 No longer a slave 
 And now You're taking us higher 
 Until we reach that day 
 Love conquers everything 
 We'll cry an anthem singing Holy, Holy 
 And when we see that day 
 We're standing face to face 
 We'll shout an anthem singing Holy, Holy 
 You took on the grave 
 So not even death can shake us 
 The Victor has won 
 And Heaven has come 
 And now You're taking us higher 
 And now You're taking us higher 
 We go from glory to glory to glory 
 We'll never be the same 
 We'll never be the same 
 You take us higher and higher and higher 
 We're forever changed 
 Forever changed

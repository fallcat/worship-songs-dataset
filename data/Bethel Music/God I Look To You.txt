God I look to You, I won't be overwhelmed 
 Give me vision to see things like You do 
 God I look to You, You're where my help comes from 
 Give me wisdom; You know just what to do 
 I will love You Lord my strength 
 I will love You Lord my shield 
 I will love You Lord my rock forever 
 All my days I will love You God 
 Hallelujah our God reigns 
 Hallelujah our God reigns 
 Hallelujah our God reigns 
 Forever all my days Hallelujah

We belong to You Father 
 Love has come, we're orphans no longer 
 Brought into Your light and freedom 
 By the blood and the mercy of Jesus 
 Its rising, its rising, the song of hope 
 From us set free 
 Its rising, its rising, its rising up 
 Hallelujah to You God of the redeemed 
 Hallelujah, You've opened blinded eyes to see 
 We will praise You 
 You are the everlasting light 
 Hallelujah to You God of the redeemed 
 We belong to You Father, living for 
 Your glory and honor 
 Here on Earth, just as in Heaven 
 We usher in, the reign of Your Kingdom

Song of all songs is the song we sing 
 Sound of all sounds heavens symphony 
 Songs of love to you from us all 
 Songs of praise you're the one we adore 
 We want to sing out loud 
 As heaven hears us and comes down 
 In this day that we live we'll show our love 
 With such awesome praise 
 You are great and greatly to be praised 
 In all the earth in all the earth 
 You are strong and powerful 
 In all the world in all the heavens 
 You are God so wonderful 
 All of heaven loves your name 
 You are great and greatly to be praised

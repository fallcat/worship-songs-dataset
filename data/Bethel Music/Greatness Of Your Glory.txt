No one has to be afraid 
 For love is stronger than the grave 
 The hand of God has made a way 
 His name is Jesus 
 Heaven reaches out for me 
 Broken on a sinner's tree 
 I was blind but now I see 
 His name is Jesus 
 God from God 
 Light from light 
 Your love broke through the great divide 
 You died and rose to testify 
 To the greatness of Your glory 
 Oh, the greatness of Your glory 
 On mountains high and valleys low 
 When suffering's all Your servants know 
 We'll share the everlasting hope 
 His name is Jesus 
 While joy and mourning have their place 
 And nothing here is put to waste 
 Death will die and love remains 
 His name is Jesus 
 Your kingdom coming closer and closer 
 Glory to Glory brighter and brighter 
 Heaven is singing louder and louder 
 Your kingdom coming closer and closer 
 Glory to Glory brighter and brighter 
 Heaven is shouting louder and louder forever and ever 
 God from God 
 Light from light 
 Your love broke through the great divide 
 You died and rose to testify 
 To the greatness of Your glory 
 You will come again to testify 
 To the greatness of Your glory 
 Oh, the greatness of Your glory 
 For the reign of God will never end 
 He has come and He will come again 
 The Lord of all my confidence 
 His name is Jesus

You can have it all, Lord 
 Every part of my world 
 Take this life and breathe on 
 This heart that is now Yours 
 You can have it all, Lord 
 Every part of my world 
 Take this life and breathe on 
 This heart that is now Yours 
 Oh the joy I've found 
 Surrendering my crowns 
 At the feet of the King 
 Who surrendered everything 
 Oh the peace that comes 
 When I'm broken and undone 
 By Your unfailing grace 
 I can lift my voice and say 
 You can have it all, Lord 
 Every part of my world 
 Take this life and breathe on 
 This heart that is now Yours 
 You can have it all, Lord 
 Every part of my world 
 Take this life and breathe on 
 This heart that is now Yours 
 There is no greater call 
 Than giving You my all 
 I lay it all down 
 I lay it all down 
 There is no greater love 
 No higher name above 
 I lay it all down 
 I lay it all down 
 There is no greater call 
 Than giving You my all 
 I lay it all down 
 I lay it all down 
 There is no greater love 
 No higher name above 
 I lay it all down 
 I lay it all down 
 You can have it all, Lord 
 Every part of my world 
 Take this life and breathe on 
 This heart that is now Yours 
 You can have it all, Lord 
 Every part of my world 
 Take this life and breathe on 
 This heart that is now Yours 
 You can have it all, Lord 
 Every part of my world 
 Take this life and breathe on 
 This heart that is now Yours

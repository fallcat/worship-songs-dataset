You are calling me again 
 I hear Your voice upon the wind 
 In the quiet in the still 
 Heaven 
 Glory written in the sky 
 In the turning of the seas 
 Echoes of Your majesty 
 Heaven 
 All that You have done 
 The promise that there's more to come 
 All that I am cries out for more of You 
 Your presence is Heaven 
 Oh to be with You 
 Just to be with You 
 Your glory all around me 
 Oh to be with You 
 I love to be with You 
 There's a stirring in my soul 
 And a fire here within 
 Deep is calling deep again 
 Heaven 
 Lord with all that You have done 
 The promise that there's more to come 
 All I am cries out for more of You 
 Your presence is Heaven 
 Oh to be with You 
 I love to be with You 
 Your glory all around me 
 Oh to be with You 
 I love to be with You 
 Heaven come 
 Fill this place 
 Glory to glory 
 And grace to grace 
 Here and now 
 Your kingdom come 
 Our God eternal 
 Now and forevermore 
 Heaven come fill this place 
 Glory to glory and grace to grace 
 Here and now Your kingdom come 
 Our God eternal now and forevermore 
 Your presence is Heaven 
 Oh to be with You 
 Just to be with You 
 Your glory all around me

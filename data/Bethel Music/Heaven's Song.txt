We have come, as one heart, as one voice 
 To join heaven's endless song on the earth 
 Lifting up our adoration towards Your throne 
 Praises rise, songs of love are now ascending 
 For the King, for the Lamb, 
 Who gave His life to save us 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, all of Heaven cries 
 Worthy, Worthy, Worthy, for You were crucified 
 The living creatures call out 
 And all the elder fall down 
 A sacrifice of living praise, we bring our all 
 For You have beckoned us into a holy place 
 A holy love, Your very presence 
 And now we stand in wondrous awe 
 A glory cry we raise to Heaven 
 With holy hands and lifted hearts 
 Eyes upon our Savior 
 And worship, they worship, we worship 
 We worship, we come and worship, we come to worship 
 Holy, Holy, God most Holy 
 Worthy to receive all glory 
 Heaven's shouting as we glorify

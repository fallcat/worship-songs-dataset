My eyes have now been fixed 
 My heart has now been set on love 
 I’ve turned my gaze to this 
 The One whom which my soul cries out for 
 Well there is none I’ve known 
 That holds my heart as You do now 
 I’ve made for you a home 
 A place where love can grow and be found 
 Draw to me Jesus 
 I’ve made my heart a home 
 My love is Jesus 
 My love is You alone 
 Draw to me Jesus 
 I’ve made my heart a home 
 My love is Jesus 
 My love is You alone 
 'Cause it will not, it will never be enough 
 Just to know about You Jesus but never call You my own 
 For my, my heart was made for love 
 I can’t live without You Jesus 
 'Cause it will not, it will never be enough 
 Just to know about You Jesus and never call You my own 
 For my, my heart was made for God 
 I can’t live without You Jesus 
 Draw to me Jesus 
 I’ve made my heart a home 
 And my love is Jesus 
 My love is You alone 
 Draw to me Jesus 
 I’ve made my heart a home 
 My love is Jesus 
 My love is You alone

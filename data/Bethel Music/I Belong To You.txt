Your love has won my heart forever 
 Not because of anything I've done 
 But You have scaled the hills and mountains 
 Just to search and find the one You love 
 I belong to You, I belong to You 
 I belong to You, forever Yours 
 And when I was drowning in my doubt 
 Your mighty right hand lifted me out 
 And now we are walking on the water 
 'Cause you lift my head above the crowd 
 And when this life is over 
 And I stand to see You face to face 
 There's nothing that I will have wanted 
 But to be with the One I belong to always

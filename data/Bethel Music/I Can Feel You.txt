The wind and waves surround me 
 And I'm tossed, feel like I'm drowning 
 I am tired, I am weak, I need You here with me 
 'Cause I can feel the rising tide 
 But I don't have the strength to fight 
 I feel clouded and confused, I need You here with me 
 In the chaos of the storm, 
 I have drifted far, far away 
 But I call out Your name 
 Cause You are just a breath, a breath away 
 Then through the shadows Your light appears 
 I've known You're with me, but now it is clear 
 I can feel You, Jesus all around 
 Like sun on my skin, warm to the touch 
 Here You surround me, and I am held by love 
 I can feel You, Jesus all around 
 Now hope is rushing through my veins 
 With everything You've rearranged 
 I am peaceful, I am brave, When You're here with me 
 All my questions find their answers here 
 When You come You change the atmosphere 
 I am focused, I am clear, When You're here with me 
 There is nothing in this world 
 That will satisfy my soul like You do 
 There is nothing in this world 
 That will satisfy my soul like You do 
 Though the storm it rages 
 I won't be moved, I won't be shaken 
 I am anchored in You 
 I can feel You, Jesus all around

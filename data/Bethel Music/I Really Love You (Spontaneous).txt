I really love You 
 I love You right now 
 I really love You 
 I love You right now 
 I really love You 
 I love You right now 
 I really love You 
 I love You right now 
 spoken: 
 Sing your own song to Him 
 Pour yourself out for 
 Our Savior, our Friend 
 'Cause we really love You 
 We love You right now 
 And this is all about You 
 And we love You right now 
 And this is not religion 
 Oh, as some would suppose 
 This is a love song 
 With every fiber of my being I compose 
 'Cause I really love You 
 My strength and shield 
 I love You right now 
 My victory and my strength 
 Oh, I really love You, yeah 
 And I love You right now 
 I really love You 
 And I love You right now 
 'Cause I really love You 
 I love You right now 
 Yeah 
 You're my victory, Jesus, oh 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 And I love You right now 
 You are my everything 
 And I love You right now 
 You are my everything 
 And I love You right now

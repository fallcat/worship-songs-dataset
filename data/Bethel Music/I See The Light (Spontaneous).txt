I see the Light 
 I'm your delight 
 You chose me 
 I've seen the Light 
 I've seen the Light 
 Yeah 
 Shame told me otherwise 
 Said that You're mad that I can't change Your mind no matter how hard I try 
 Shame told me otherwise 
 But I don't listen to lies now 
 I don't listen to lies now 
 And they're falling aside now 
 'Cause I've seen the Light 
 You're on my side 
 You're for me 
 And I've seen the Light 
 I am Your prize 
 You've chose me 
 And I've seen the Light 
 And I'm Your delight 
 You love me 
 And I've seen the Light 
 You'll be with pride when You look upon me 
 And I've seen the Light 
 He's on our side 
 He's for us 
 And I've seen the Light 
 He's full of pride when He looks on me 
 Because He loves me 
 He loves me 
 He loves me 
 I know He loves me 
 He loves me 
 He loves me 
 Oh I know He is for me 
 He is for me 
 He is for me 
 And I've seen the Light 
 And I believe it now 
 Beyond a shadow of a doubt 
 That You love me, that You love me 
 I've seen the Light 
 I've seen the Light

Your Presence is all I need 
 It's all I want, all I seek 
 Without it, without it there's no meaning 
 Your Presence is the air I breathe 
 The song I sing, the love I need 
 Without it, without it I'm not living 
 I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt You, Lord 
 There is no one like You God 
 I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt You, Lord 
 No other name be lifted high 
 There will be no one like You 
 And no one beside You 
 You alone are worthy of all praise

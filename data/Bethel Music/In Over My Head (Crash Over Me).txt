I have come to this place in my life 
 I’m full but I’ve not satisfied 
 This longing to have more of You 
 And I can feel it my heart is convinced 
 I’m thirsty my soul can’t be quenched 
 You already know this but still 
 Come and do whatever You want to 
 I’m standing knee deep but I’m out where never been 
 And I feel You coming and I hear Your voice on the wind 
 Would you come and tear down the boxes that I have tried to put You in 
 Let love come teach me who You are again 
 Would You take me back to the place where my heart was only about You 
 And all I wanted was just to be with You 
 Come and do whatever You want to 
 And further and further my heart moves away from the shore 
 Whatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours 
 And further and further my heart moves away from the shore 
 Whatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours 
 Then You crash over me and I’ve lost control but I’m free 
 I’m going under, I’m in over my head 
 And You crash over me, and that's where You want me to be 
 I’m going under, I’m in over my head 
 Whether I sink, whether I swim 
 Oh, it makes no difference when 
 I’m beautifully in over my head 
 And whether I sink, whether I swim 
 It makes no difference when 
 I’m beautifully in over my head 
 And I am beautifully in over my head 
 Beautifully in over my head

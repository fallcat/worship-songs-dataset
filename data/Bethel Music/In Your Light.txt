In Your light I find my strength 
 In Your truth I overcome 
 In Your grace I lose myself 
 For in Your love 
 You've turned my tears of sadness 
 Into such joy and gladness 
 My heart can't keep it in I'm shouting, shouting 
 In Your joy I find my strength 
 In Your hope I overcome 
 In Your grace I lose myself 
 For in Your love 
 Woah-oh, woah-oh

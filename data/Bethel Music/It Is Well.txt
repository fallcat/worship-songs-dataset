Grander earth has quaked before 
 Moved by the sound of His voice 
 Seas that are shaken and stirred 
 Can be calmed and broken for my regard 
 Through it all, through it all 
 My eyes are on You 
 Through it all, through it all 
 It is well 
 Through it all, through it all 
 My eyes are on You 
 It is well with me 
 Far be it from me to not believe 
 Even when my eyes can't see 
 And this mountain that's in front of me 
 Will be thrown into the midst of the sea 
 So let go my soul and trust in Him 
 The waves and wind still know His name 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well, it is well with my soul

Old things have passed away 
 Your love has stayed the same 
 Your constant grace remains the cornerstone 
 Things that we thought were dead 
 Are breathing in life again 
 You cause your Son to shine on darkest nights 
 For all that you’ve done 
 We will pour out our love 
 This will be our anthem song 
 Jesus, we love you 
 Oh how we love you 
 You are the one our 
 Our hearts adore 
 The hopeless have found their hope 
 The orphans now have a home 
 All that was lost has found its place in you 
 You lift our weary head 
 You make us strong instead 
 You took these rags and made us beautiful 
 For all that you’ve done 
 We will pour out our love 
 This will be our anthem song

Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run 
 The fountain I drink from, oh He is my song 
 Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide 
 The ransom for my life, oh He is my song 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 Let the King of my heart be the wind inside my sails 
 The anchor in the waves, oh He is my song 
 Let the King of my heart be the fire inside my veins 
 And the echo of my days, oh He is my song 
 You're never gonna let, never gonna let me down 
 You're never gonna let, never gonna let me down 
 You're never gonna let, never gonna let me down 
 You're never gonna let, never gonna let me down

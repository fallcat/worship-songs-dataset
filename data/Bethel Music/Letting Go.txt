You've brought me to the end of myself 
 And this has been the longest road 
 Just when my hallelujah was tired 
 You gave me a new song 
 I'm letting go 
 I'm letting go 
 I'm letting go 
 Falling into you 
 I confess I still get scared sometimes 
 But perfect love comes rushing 
 And all the lies that screamed inside go silent 
 The moment you begin 
 You remind me of things forgotten 
 You unwind me until I'm totally undone 
 And with Your arms around me 
 Fear was no match for Your love 
 Now You've won me

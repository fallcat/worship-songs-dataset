He's coming on the clouds 
 Kings and kingdoms will bow down 
 Every chain will break 
 As broken hearts declare His praise 
 For who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah 
 He's roaring with power and fighting our battles 
 Every knee will bow before Him 
 Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain 
 For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains 
 Every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Every knee will bow before Him 
 Open up the gates 
 Make way before the King of Kings 
 The God who comes to save 
 Is here to set the captives free 
 For who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Our God is the Lion 
 The Lion of Judah 
 He's roaring with power 
 And fighting our battles 
 Every knee will bow before Him 
 Our God is the Lamb 
 The Lamb that was slain 
 For the sins of the world 
 His blood breaks the chains 
 And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Every knee will bow before Him 
 For who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord almighty? 
 My God is the Lion 
 The Lion of Judah 
 He's roaring with power 
 And fighting our battles 
 And every knee will bow before Him 
 Our God is the Lamb 
 The Lamb that was slain 
 For the sins of the world 
 His blood breaks the chains 
 And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Every knee will bow before Him

If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear Your voice 
 I'll hold on to what is true though I cannot see 
 If the storms of life they come and the road ahead gets steep 
 I will lift these hands in faith I will believe 
 I remind myself of all that You've done 
 And the life I have because of Your Son 
 Love came down and rescued me Love came down and set me free 
 Now I am Yours I am forever Yours 
 Mountain high or valley low I sing out remind my soul 
 I am Yours I am forever Yours 
 When my heart is filled with hope when every promise comes my way 
 When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me 
 Staying desperate for You God Staying humbled at Your feet 
 I will lift these and praise I will believe 
 I am Yours I am Yours all my days I am Yours

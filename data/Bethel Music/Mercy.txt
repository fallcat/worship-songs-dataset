My past embraced 
 My sin forgiven 
 I'm blameless in Your sight 
 My history rewritten 
 You delight in showing mercy 
 And Mercy triumphs over judgement 
 You delight in showing mercy 
 And Mercy triumphs over judgement 
 Oh, Love, Great Love 
 Fear cannot be found in You 
 And there will never be a day 
 You're uncertain of the ones You choose 
 So I will awake, and spend my days 
 Loving the One who has raised me up 
 From death to life, from wrong to right 
 You're making all things beautiful

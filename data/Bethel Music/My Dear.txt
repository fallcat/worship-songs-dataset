I am Yours and You are mine 
 I am ravished by the sight 
 Of one glimpse into Your eyes 
 My lovers coming for His bride 
 : 
 For there is none upon the earth 
 That I desire before you, Lord 
 For you've been faithful all my days 
 Your love endures, it will never fade away 
 I need to say what my soul is singing 
 I need to say what my heart is screaming 
 That I love You my Dear 
 I love You my Dear, my Dear 
 I love You my Dear 
 I love You my Dear, my Dear 
 You're everything I ever wanted 
 Everything I ever needed 
 You're everything I ever wanted 
 Everything I ever needed

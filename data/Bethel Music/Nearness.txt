I stand with so many questions 
 But You know all of the answers 
 And whether this side of Heaven 
 I know that You are the Healer 
 And my heart will stay steadfast 
 I know that You are good 
 And my heart will stay steadfast 
 I know that You are good 
 Comforter You are to me 
 Shelter from the cold 
 Constant how You carry me 
 Never letting go 
 You are with me 
 And Your voice holds me together 
 When I feel like Iâ€™m falling apart 
 And I place my world in Your hands 
 And You come and steady my heart 
 I feel you in the stillness 
 I know that You are good 
 I feel you in the stillness 
 I know that You are good 
 Comforter You are to me 
 Shelter from the cold 
 Constant how You carry me 
 Never letting go 
 You are with me 
 Comforter You are to me 
 Shelter from the cold 
 Constant how You carry me 
 Never letting go 
 You are with me 
 Emmanuel 
 God with us, God with us 
 You are Emmanuel 
 And I feel You in the stillness 
 'Cause I know that You are good 
 And I feel You in the stillness 
 And I know that You are good 
 And my heart will stay steadfast 
 'Cause I know that You are good 
 And my heart will stay steadfast 
 'Cause I know that You are good

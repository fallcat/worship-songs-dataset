You unravel me with a melody 
 You surround me with a song 
 Of deliverance from my enemies 
 Till all my fears are gone 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 From my Mother's womb 
 You have chosen me 
 Love has called my name 
 I’ve been born again into your family 
 Your blood flows through my veins 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I am surrounded by the arms of the Father 
 I am surrounded by songs of deliverance 
 We've been liberated from our bondage 
 We're the sons and the daughters 
 Let us our sing our freedom 
 You split the sea so I could walk right through it 
 My fears are drowned in perfect love 
 You rescued me and I will stand and sing 
 I am a child of God 
 You split the sea so I could walk right through it 
 You drowned my fears in perfect love 
 You rescued me and I will stand and sing 
 I am a child of God 
 Yes I am 
 I am a child of God 
 I am a child of God 
 Yes I am 
 I am a child of God 
 Full of faith 
 Yes I am a child of God 
 I am a child of God 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I’m no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God

O Taste and see that the Lord is good 
 O Taste and see that the Lord is good to me 
 You have turned my mourning into dancing 
 Put off my rags and clothed me with gladness 
 And I will arise and 
 I will praise you 
 I'll sing and not be silent 
 O Lord my God I will give thanks to you forever 
 I will live only for you 
 I will lift these hands up to you 
 I will dance before you 
 I will shout it I will shout it to you

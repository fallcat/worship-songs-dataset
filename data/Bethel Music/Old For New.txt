What was torn You mend again 
 You redesign the tattered thread by thread 
 You take the broken and destroyed 
 You rebuild, You make whole 
 Joy begin to rise 
 Hope begin to light the dark 
 Our God exchanges old for new 
 Dawn has conquered night 
 Death has lost to life 
 And now we are exchanging old for new 
 You turn our flame into a fire 
 In You we walk in the impossible 
 We take Your love into the world 
 We let our light shine, we let it burn 
 There's nothing that Your love won't do 
 There's not a mountain faith can't move 
 There's power in the blood 
 The power of the cross 
 There's nothing that Your love won't do 
 There's not a mountain faith can't move 
 There's power in the blood 
 The power of the cross

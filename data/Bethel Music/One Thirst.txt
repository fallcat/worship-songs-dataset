You say to us, "Seek My Face" 
 Our hearts reply, "Your Face we seek" 
 We seek 
 Come teach us Lord, reveal Your ways, 
 Anoint us for, the greater things 
 Greater things 
 We have gathered with one thirst and hunger 
 Here to drink of (lift up) glory and wonder 
 Here to cry out, "Come and fill this place!" 
 Our single wish, our sole desire 
 To gaze upon, Your beauty God 
 We will not rest, nor will we cease 
 Till with our eyes, Your face we see 
 We see 
 We wait for you to come and show 
 Your glory here today 
 We wait for You... 
 Hallelujah, Come (repeat)

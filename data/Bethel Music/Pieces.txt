Unreserved, unrestrained 
 Your love is wild, Your love is wild for me 
 It isn't shy, It's unashamed 
 Your love is proud, to be seen with me 
 You don't give Your heart in pieces 
 You don't hide Yourself to tease us 
 Uncontrolled, uncontained 
 Your love is a fire, burning bright for me 
 It's not just a spark, it's not just a flame 
 Your love is a light, that all the world will see 
 All the world will see 
 Your love's not fractured 
 It's not a troubled mind 
 It isn't anxious 
 It's not the restless kind 
 Your love's not passive 
 It's never disengaged 
 It's always present 
 It hangs on every word You say 
 Love keeps its promises 
 It keeps its word 
 It honors what's sacred 
 'Cause its vows are good 
 Your love's not broken 
 It's not insecure 
 Your love's not selfish 
 Your love is pure 
 You don't give Your heart in pieces 
 You don't hide Yourself to tease us

For every curse, You’re the cure 
 For every sickness, You’re the healer 
 For every storm, You’re the calm 
 For all that’s lost, oh, what a Savior 
 On that cross of Calvary 
 Every burden has been defeated 
 Every wretched heart redeemed 
 You drown our sin in seas of crimson 
 And Hallelujah Death is beaten 
 Christ has risen from the grave 
 And Hallelujah it is finished 
 All to You the highest praise 
 On that day of utmost glory 
 All of darkness cannot tarry 
 And every shackle will come undone 
 My solid rock, thine is the Kingdom 
 And every shackle will come undone 
 My solid rock, thine is the kingdom 
 And Hallelujah Death is beaten 
 Christ has risen from the grave 
 And Hallelujah it is finished 
 All to You the highest praise 
 Sing Hallelujah Death is beaten 
 Christ has risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah now and forever 
 All to You the highest praise 
 Where there was sin 
 Your love rushed in 
 Where sin runs deep 
 Your grace runs deeper 
 For all enslaved the ransom paid 
 Light of the world 
 Yours is the power 
 Where there was sin 
 Your love rushed in 
 Where sin runs deep 
 Your grace runs deeper 
 For all enslaved the ransom paid 
 Light of the world 
 Yours is the power 
 Sing Hallelujah Death is beaten 
 Christ has risen from the grave 
 And Hallelujah it is finished 
 All to You the highest praise 
 Sing Hallelujah Death is beaten 
 Christ has risen from the grave 
 And Hallelujah now and forever 
 All to You the highest praise 
 On that cross of Calvary 
 Where every burden has been defeated 
 And every wretched heart redeemed 
 You drown our sin in seas of crimson

I was stumbling in the darkness 
 Couldn't see my hand in front of me 
 I was sending up an SOS 
 When all was lost, You came running 
 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
 You sent the shadows scattering 
 When through the cloud a piercing light 
 And then I saw You 
 Shine, shine, shine like the sun 
 You're waking us to life, You've only begun 
 Every fear, every doubt disappears when 
 You shine on us 
 We wanna see You 
 Shine, shine, shine like the stars 
 You are the first love to open my heart 
 Every hope, every dream comes alive when You shine on us 
 Heart of stone into a prism 
 Light of heaven flowing through me 
 Black and white to vibrant color 
 I'm reflecting your beauty 
 I'm overwhelmed I'm overwhelmed 
 Just standing in Your presence 
 Your face illuminates the sky 
 Shine, shine, shine like the sun 
 You're waking us to life, You've only begun 
 Every fear, every doubt disappears when 
 You shine on us

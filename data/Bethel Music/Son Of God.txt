There is a place 
 Of sorrow and love 
 The innocent Saviour 
 Broken and bleeding for us 
 The nails in His hands 
 Thorns on His brow 
 Rivers of mercy 
 Endlessly flowing down 
 The Son of God 
 High and lifted up 
 The Father's love 
 Came pouring down for us 
 He has overcome 
 There is a place 
 For all who would come 
 His arms are open 
 Our sins are washed white in His blood 
 The lost and unworthy 
 Come find your home 
 The broken and hurting 
 His love will never let go 
 The Son of God 
 High and lifted up 
 The Father's love 
 Came pouring down for us 
 He has overcome 
 The spotless lamb 
 For every sinner slain 
 Our victory 
 Our hope beyond the grave 
 He has overcome 
 He has overcome, yeah 
 Now my song will ever be 
 Of my Savior's love for me 
 When at last His face I see 
 With all the saints in glory 
 Now my song will ever be 
 Of my Savior's love for me 
 When at last His face I see 
 With all the saints in glory 
 The Son of God 
 High and lifted up 
 The Father's love 
 Came pouring down for us 
 He has overcome 
 The spotless lamb 
 For every sinner slain 
 Our victory 
 Our hope beyond the grave 
 And He has overcome 
 And He has overcome 
 And He has overcome

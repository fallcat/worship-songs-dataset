I feel it in my bones You're about to move 
 I feel it in the wind You're about to ride in 
 You said that You would pour Your Spirit out 
 You said that You would fall on sons and daughters 
 So come 
 I feel it in my bones You're about to move 
 I feel it in the wind You're about to ride in 
 You said that You would pour Your Spirit out 
 You said that You would fall on sons and daughters 
 So like the rain come drench us in love 
 And let Your glory rush in like a flood 
 We are fixed on this one thing 
 To know Your goodness and see Your glory 
 We're transformed by this one thing 
 To know Your presence and see Your beauty 
 I can see it now Your kingdom come 
 I can hear it now the sounds of heaven 
 You said that if we ask we'll receive 
 So we are asking for the greater measure 
 So like the rain come drench us in love 
 And let Your power rush in like a flood 
 We are fixed on this one thing 
 To know Your goodness and see Your glory 
 We're transformed by this one thing 
 To know Your presence and see Your beauty 
 So come and blow on through 
 Spirit move, we're ready for You 
 To come and blow on through 
 Come and do what only You can do 
 So come and blow on through 
 Spirit move, we're ready for You 
 To come and blow on through 
 Come and do what only You can do 
 We are fixed on this one thing 
 To know Your goodness and see Your glory 
 We're transformed by this one thing 
 To know Your presence and see Your beauty 
 We are fixed on this one thing 
 To know Your goodness and see Your glory 
 We're transformed by this one thing 
 To know Your presence and see Your beauty

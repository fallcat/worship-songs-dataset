You're like starlight in the dark 
 Endless miles can't conceal You 
 Every glimmer is a spark 
 Catching fire as You break through 
 Oh, You're not far away 
 You come in close 
 Oh, even as I wait 
 You come in close 
 You're like summer in the night 
 The sun goes down but still I feel You 
 Every shadow's turning bright 
 Every broken heart is made new 
 There's no heart unseen 
 There's no space between 
 You and I, You and I 
 You are closer than 
 The very oxygen 
 I'm breathing in 
 I breathe You in 
 You are God with us 
 You are here with us 
 Immanuel, Immanuel 
 You are infinite 
 Your glory has no end 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Oh, You're not far away 
 You come in close 
 Oh, even as I wait 
 You come in close

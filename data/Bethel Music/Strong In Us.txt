When darkness rises all around us 
 We will see His glory breaking through the night 
 The King in all His wonder fills us with His power 
 Christ in us, the answer, A hope for all the world 
 Our God is strong in us 
 His love has overcome 
 He is alive in us, He is the Risen One 
 The same power that raised Him up 
 Is the power that lives in us 
 Our God is strong in us, Our God is strong in us 
 His promise stands throughout the ages 
 He will never leave us, We are not alone 
 Greater than our weakness, He is strong to save us 
 We will stand victorious, A hope for all the world 
 Lift Him up, let the whole world see 
 We will never stop singing 
 Lift Him up, let the whole world hear 
 We will never stop shouting 
 Lift Him up, every voice in praise 
 Everyone lift Him up

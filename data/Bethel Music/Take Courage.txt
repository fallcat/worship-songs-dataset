Slow down take time 
 Breathe in, He said 
 He'd reveal what's to come 
 The thoughts in His mind 
 Always higher than mine 
 And He'll reveal all to come 
 Take courage my heart, stay steadfast my soul 
 He's in the waiting, He's in the waiting 
 Hold onto your hope, as your triumph unfolds 
 He's never failing, He's never failing 
 Sing praise my soul 
 Find strength in joy 
 Let His words lead You on 
 Do not forget 
 His great faithfulness 
 He'll finish all He's begun 
 You who hold the stars 
 Who call them each by name 
 Will surely keep Your promise to me 
 That I will rise in Your victory 
 Take courage my heart, stay steadfast my soul 
 He's in the waiting, He's in the waiting 
 Hold onto your hope, watch your triumph unfold 
 He's never failing, He's never failing

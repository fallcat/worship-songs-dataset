How do I say 
 Thank you Lord 
 For the way that You love 
 And the way that You come 
 For all that You've done 
 And all that You'll do 
 My heart pours out 
 Thank you 
 You don't have to come 
 But You always do 
 You show up in splendor 
 And change the whole room 
 You don't have to come 
 But You always do 
 You show up in splendor 
 And change the whole room 
 How do I say 
 Thank you Lord 
 For the life that You gave 
 And the cross that You bore 
 For the love you poured out 
 To ransom my soul 
 My heart pours out 
 This thankful song 
 You don't have to come 
 But You always do 
 You show up in splendor 
 And You change the whole room 
 You don't have to come 
 But You always do 
 You show up in splendor 
 And You change the whole room 
 You walked through all of my walls 
 Conquered my shame 
 Stepped into my past 
 Filled my world with grace 
 You didn't have to come 
 But You wanted to 
 You walked through all of my walls 
 Conquered my shame 
 Stepped into my past 
 Filled my world with grace 
 You didn't have to come 
 But You wanted to

The war is over turn around 
 Lay your weapons on the ground 
 The smoke is fading before the light 
 The dead are coming back to life 
 He has made a way for us 
 Born for glory out of dust 
 Children held within the arms of peace 
 He has made a way for all 
 Mercy waits where sinners fall 
 He is our victory 
 The war is over His love has come 
 To call us daughters and sons 
 No longer orphans without a home 
 We have found where we belong 
 It is finished, it is done 
 The blood of Jesus overcomes 
 It is finished, He has won 
 He has won 
 It is finished, it is done 
 The blood of Jesus overcomes 
 It is finished, He has won 
 He has won 
 It is finished, it is done 
 The blood of Jesus overcomes 
 It is finished, He has won 
 He has won 
 He has made a way for us 
 Born for glory out of dust 
 Children held within the arms of peace 
 He has made a way for all 
 Mercy waits where sinners fall 
 He is our victory 
 He is our victory 
 He is our victory 
 He has made a way for us 
 Born for glory out of dust 
 Children held within the arms of peace 
 He has made a way for all 
 Mercy waits where sinners fall 
 He is our victory 
 He is our victory

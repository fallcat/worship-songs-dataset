Your singing moves and shakes the ground 
 Your beckon brings the rain in drought 
 Your glory spins the earth around 
 Your whisper makes Your fire fall down 
 There's no other name 
 The name that stands through the ages 
 There's no other name 
 There's no other name like Yours 
 Jesus, like Yours Jesus 
 Your word commands the wind and waves 
 Your touch revives the sick and lame 
 Your power wakes the dead again 
 Your love destroys the grip of sin 
 Your love destroys the grip of sin 
 Every knee will bow 
 Every tongue confess 
 The name of Jesus

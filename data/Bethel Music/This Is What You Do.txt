It's always like springtime with You 
 Making all things new 
 Your light is breaking through the dark 
 This love it is sweeter than wine 
 Bringing joy, bringing life 
 Your hope is rising like the dawn 
 This is what You do 
 This is what You do 
 You make me come alive 
 You make me come alive 
 You make me come alive 
 You make me come alive 
 It's like I'm living for the first time 
 Finally living for the first time

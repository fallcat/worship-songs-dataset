Up from the ashes Your love has brought us 
 Out of the darkness into the light 
 Lifting our sorrows 
 Bearing our burdens healing our hearts 
 To our God we lift up one voice 
 To our God we lift up one song 
 To our God we lift up one voice 
 Singing Hallelujah 
 Chains have been broken eyes have been opened 
 An army of dry bones is starting rise 
 Death is defeated 
 We are victorious for You are alive 
 Hallelujah Hallelujah (repeat) 
 We'll make His praise glorious glorious, glorious 
 For His name is glorious, glorious, glorious 
 Make His praise glorious, glorious, glorious 
 Shout His name Glorious, Glorious, Glorious

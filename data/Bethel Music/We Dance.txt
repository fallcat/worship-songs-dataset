You steady me 
 Slow and sweet, we sway 
 Take the lead and I will follow 
 Finally ready now 
 To close my eyes and just believe 
 That You won't lead me where You don't go 
 When my faith gets tired 
 And my hope seems lost 
 You spin me round and round 
 And remind me of that song 
 The one You wrote for me 
 And we dance 
 And we dance 
 And I've been told 
 To pick up my sword and fight for love 
 Little did I know that Love had won for me 
 Here in Your arms 
 You still my heart again 
 And I breath You in like I've never breathed till now 
 And I will lock eyes with the One who's ransomed me 
 The One who gave me joy for mourning 
 Oh I will lock eyes with the One who's chosen me 
 The One who set my feet to dancing

For we trust in our God 
 And through His unfailing love 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 For we trust in our God 
 And through His unfailing love 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 Though the battle rages 
 We will stand in the fight 
 Though the armies rise up against us on all sides 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 For in the hour of our darkest day 
 We will not tremble, we wonâ€™t be afraid 
 Hope is rising like the light of dawn 
 Our God is for us, He has overcome 
 For we trust in our God 
 And through His unfailing love 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 For we trust in our God 
 And through His unfailing love 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 All those against Him will fall 
 For our God is stronger 
 He can do all things 
 No higher name we can call 
 For Jesus is greater 
 We can do all things 
 All those against Him will fall 
 For our God is stronger 
 He can do all things 
 No higher name we can call 
 For Jesus is greater 
 We can do all things 
 For we trust in our God 
 And through His unfailing love 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 For we trust in our God 
 And through His unfailing love 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be shaken

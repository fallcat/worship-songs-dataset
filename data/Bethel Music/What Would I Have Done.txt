I will not forget the cross the pain that You endured for us 
 Where You carried brokenness and shame 
 Never to forget the day Your love broke through to make a way 
 For hope to rise within my heart again 
 Overwhelming sacrifice You freely paid the highest price 
 Suffering You traded blood for me 
 My heart will sing the deepest praise my lips rejoice my hands will raise 
 For the death that brought me into life 
 All for love 
 My Jesus You gave all for love 
 I am standing in the wonder of 
 Your great love 
 What would I have done if it wasn't for Your love 
 The love that tore the veil inside my heart 
 What would I have become if it wasn't for Your blood 
 The blood You gave for all on the cross

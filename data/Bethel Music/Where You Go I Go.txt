Where you go I go 
 What you say I say 
 What you pray I pray 
 What you pray I pray 
 Jesus only did what he saw you do 
 He would only say what he heard you speak 
 He would only move when he felt you lead 
 Following your heart following your spirit 
 How could I expect to walk without you 
 When every move that Jesus made was in surrender 
 I will not begin to live without you 
 For you alone are worthy and you are always good 
 Though the world sees and soon forgets 
 We will not forget who you are and what you've done for us

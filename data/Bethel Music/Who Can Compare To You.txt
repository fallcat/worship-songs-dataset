Where would I be 
 If it wasn’t for Your kindness toward me 
 You’ve been closer than a friend could ever be 
 There is nothing on the Earth that could take Your place 
 I am undone 
 For You see all there was and all that will be 
 Yet You’ve set your vast affection upon me 
 By Your voice the world was made and still You called my name 
 Who can compare to You 
 Who moves my heart the way You do 
 Who can compare to You 
 Who moves my heart the way You do 
 I am undone 
 For You see all there was and all that will be 
 Yet You’ve set your vast affection upon me 
 By Your voice the world was made and still You called my name 
 Who can compare to You 
 Who moves my heart the way You do 
 Who can compare to You 
 Who moves my heart the way You do 
 Who can compare to You 
 Who moves my heart the way You do 
 Who can compare to You 
 Who moves my heart the way You do 
 Kingdoms come and kingdoms fade 
 But always You remain 
 Ages pass and seasons change 
 But always You remain 
 Kingdoms come and kingdoms fade 
 But always You remain 
 Ages pass and seasons change 
 But always You remain the same 
 Kingdoms come and kingdoms fade 
 But always You remain 
 Ages pass and seasons change 
 But always You remain the same 
 You remain the same 
 You remain the same 
 You remain the same

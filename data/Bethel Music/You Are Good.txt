I want to scream it out 
 From every mountain top 
 Your goodness knows no bounds 
 Your goodness never stops 
 Your mercy follows me 
 Your kindness fills my life 
 Your love amazes me 
 I sing because You are good 
 And I dance because You are good 
 And I shout because You are good 
 You are good to me to me 
 Nothing and no one comes 
 Anywhere close to You 
 The earth and oceans deep 
 Only reflect this truth 
 And in my darkest night 
 You shine as bright as day 
 Your love amazes me 
 With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim 
 You are good You are good 
 In the Sun or rain my life celebrates 
 You are good You are good 
 With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim 
 You are good You are good 
 In the Sun or rain my life celebrates 
 You are good You are good

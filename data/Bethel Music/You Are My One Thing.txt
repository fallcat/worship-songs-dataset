Your voice ever close you called me 
 You never gave up pursuing 
 I fell in love you stole my heart 
 Your hand ever near I hold to 
 I long for your heart to know you 
 Just to live in your fellowship 
 Just to be close to you 
 Just to walk next to you 
 Oh, this is my one thing 
 You are my one thing 
 Just to be close to you 
 Just to walk next to you 
 Oh, this is my one thing 
 You are my one thing 
 My eyes ever fixed upon you 
 To live like a child to trust you 
 Oh, I’ll hold on to this treasured love 
 My life ever set at your feet 
 I give you my heart completely 
 To live this life always by your side 
 Just to be close to you 
 Just to walk next to you 
 Oh, this is my one thing 
 You are my one thing 
 Just to be close to you 
 Just to walk next to you 
 Oh, this is my one thing 
 You are my one thing 
 I have to know you 
 All that’s within me 
 Cries out for your presence, God 
 Oh, nothing compares 
 Oh, there’s no one else 
 Oh, Jesus you’re my one desire 
 Oh, nothing compares 
 Oh, there’s no one else 
 Oh, Jesus you’re my one desire 
 Oh, Jesus you're my one desire 
 Just to be close to you 
 Just to walk next to you 
 Oh, this is my one thing 
 You are my one thing 
 Just to be close to you 
 Just to walk next to you 
 Oh, this is my one thing 
 You are my one thing

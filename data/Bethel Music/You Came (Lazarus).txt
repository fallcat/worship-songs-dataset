You stood outside my grave 
 With tears still on Your face 
 I heard You say my name 
 My night was turned to day 
 You came, I knew that You would come 
 You sang, My heart it woke up 
 I'm not afraid, I see Your face, I am alive 
 You came, I knew that You would come 
 You said death's only sleeping 
 With one word my heart was beating 
 I rose up from my grave 
 My fear was turned to faith 
 You are a miracle-working God 
 You are a miracle-working God 
 You are a miracle-working God 
 You are a miracle-working God 
 You are a miracle-working God 
 You are a miracle-working God

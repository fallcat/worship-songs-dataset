When You stand 
 I feel the floor of Heaven tremble 
 As You breathe 
 We live and have our being, oh 
 When you speak 
 Oh I feel it in my chest 
 And when You sing 
 All my fears are put to rest 
 And what a wondrous thing 
 I can stand to sing 
 'Cause when I fall to my knees 
 You’re the one who pulls me up again 
 And what a mystery 
 That You notice me 
 And in a crowd of ten thousand 
 You don’t miss a thing 
 Oh, You don't miss a thing 
 When you sigh 
 The wind becomes a sonnet 
 When you laugh 
 The storm around me ceases 
 You whisper 
 And all my enemies are scattered 
 'Cause You surround me 
 With angels on assignment 
 And what a wondrous thing 
 I can stand to sing 
 'Cause when I fall to my knees 
 You’re the one who pulls me up again 
 And what a mystery 
 That You notice me 
 And in a crowd of ten thousand 
 You don’t miss a thing 
 'Cause You see everything 
 Yeah, I am seen and I am known 
 By the King of kings and Lord of lords 
 There's no place I can go Your love won't find me 
 No place I can hide that You don't see 
 No place I could fall Your love couldn't catch me 
 You see it all 
 You see it all 
 Through the eyes of love 
 There's no place I could go Your love won't find me 
 No place I could hide that You can't see 
 No place I could fall Your love wouldn't catch me 
 You see it all 
 You see it all 
 And You're in everything 
 You're all around me, yeah 
 When I was lost still You pursued 
 There's no place I can go Your love won't find me 
 No place I could hide that You don't see 
 When I misunderstand Your love understands me 
 You see it all 
 You see it all 
 You're in everything, oh 
 You're all around me 
 You surround me 
 With Your song 
 With a song, oh 
 There's no place I could go that You won't find me 
 There's no place I could hide that You don't see 
 No place I could fall Your love wouldn't catch me 
 You see it all 
 You see it all 
 Through the eyes of love 
 So come and see me 
 Come and know me 
 Come and search my heart 
 And make me like You, like You 
 I just want to be like You 
 Come and see me 
 Come and know me 
 Come and search my heart 
 And make me new 
 Make me new 
 I want to be just like You

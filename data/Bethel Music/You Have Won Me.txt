Grace, You've shown me grace 
 You've lifted my shame 
 Drawn me with loving kindness 
 Washed whiter than snow 
 You have redeemed and made me whole 
 Jesus, You have won me You have broken every 
 Chain with love and mercy You have triumphed over 
 Death and You are worthy of glory and praise 
 Love, You've shown me love 
 By leaving Your throne 
 By bleeding and dying on a cross 
 That wonderful cross 
 That took all my guilt and sin away 
 Shout it out and lift up one voice in worship 
 Sing it out until all the earth can hear it 
 Jesus is alive and He saves, He rescues and saves

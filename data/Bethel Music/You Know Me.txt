You have been and You will be 
 You have seen and You will see 
 You know when I rise and when I fall 
 When I come or go You see it all 
 You hung the stars and you move the sea 
 And still You know me 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh You know me (repeat) 
 Nothing is hidden from Your sight 
 Wherever I go, You find me 
 You know every detail of my life 
 You are God and You don't miss a thing 
 You memorize me

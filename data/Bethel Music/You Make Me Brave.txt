I stand before You now 
 The greatness of Your renown 
 I have heard of the majesty and wonder of You 
 King of Heaven in humility I bow 
 As Your love, in wave after wave 
 Crashes over me, crashes over me 
 For You are for us, You are not against us 
 Champion of Heaven 
 You made a way for all to enter in (to Your love) 
 I have heard You calling my name 
 I have heard the song of love that You sing 
 So I will let you draw me out beyond the shore 
 Into Your grace 
 You make me brave, You make me brave 
 You call me out beyond the shore into the waves 
 You make me brave, You make me brave 
 No fear can hinder now the Love that made a way 
 You make me brave, You make me brave 
 You call me out beyond the shore into the waves 
 You make me brave, You make me brave 
 No fear can hinder now the promises You've made

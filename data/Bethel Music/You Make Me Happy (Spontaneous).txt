 Just press into Him tonight 
 Just turn your affection towards Him 
 We set our gaze on You 
 We put our attention on You 
 All of our love is for You 
 You're the reason why we breathe 
 You're the air that I breathe, oh 
 You bring calm to the storm 
 You bring life to me 
 And You're the air that I breathe 
 And I love You, God 
 I love You, God

 Lift your voices 
 I just love You, God 
 I bring You a real song 
 I just love You, God

 Lift up your own song 
 Lift up your own heart cry 
 From where you're at tonight 
 Start to sing it out 
 Love You, God, oh 
 Love You, God

 That's so sweet tonight 
 Lift your voices

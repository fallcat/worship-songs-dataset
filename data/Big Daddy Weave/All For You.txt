I wanna sing like I'm driving in the car all by myself 
 I wanna dance like I just won the lottery 
 I wanna lift my hands and spin around 
 I wanna throw my head back and shout 
 Like a prisoner who's just found out he's free 
 I will give my everything 
 I'll be a fool for You 
 Because I am in love with You 
 I wanna sing and shout 
 I wanna dance around 
 I wanna forget who I used to be 
 And embrace Your truth 
 So when I sing and shout 
 Or when I dance around 
 When I lay my pride down 
 It's all for You, it's all for You 
 I wanna live learning how to make my life a sacrifice 
 I wanna die to find my true identity 
 I wanna answer at Your beckon call 
 Wanna do my best and give my all 
 I wanna hold on to You and let go of me 
 So let me give my everything 
 I'll be a fool for You 
 Because I am in love with You 
 I wanna sing and shout 
 I wanna dance around 
 I wanna forget who I used to be 
 And embrace Your truth 
 So when I sing and shout 
 Or when I dance around 
 When I lay my pride down 
 It's all for You 
 With sweet success already gained 
 Self righteousness is not my aim 
 I'm raised from death into Your life, so free 
 Not on my own but by Your grace 
 I'm gazing long into Your face 
 And I can't keep this passion bottled up inside of me 
 I wanna sing and shout 
 I wanna dance around 
 I wanna forget who I used to be 
 And embrace Your truth 
 So when I sing and shout 
 Or when I dance around 
 When I lay my pride down 
 It's all for You 
 Sing and shout 
 It's all for You 
 Dance around 
 It's all for You 
 Sing and shout 
 It's all for You 
 Dance around 
 It's all for You

There's an old man sitting on a lonely park bench 
 He doesn't have a place to stay 
 And there's a woman who's living all by herself now 
 Since her husband left one day 
 Seems like we're all just pawns 
 In a game that has no rules 
 And I keep wondering, am I the biggest fool 
 There's an unborn child who never had a chance 
 Since convenience took its toll 
 And there's a guy who lost his house and wife and kids 
 Since the bottle took control 
 It just goes on and on 
 Who knows when it will end 
 And I can't stop thinking 
 Is it all the same? 'Cause nothing ever changes, oh 
 Under the sun I can't seem to find what I need, oh 
 You know it's all the same 
 Because they're only different faces, oh 
 Under the sun I can't seem to find any peace 
 There was a man who came and lived a perfect life 
 He came to give it all away 
 And the people clung to every word He said 
 Oh, until that final day 
 And then they nailed Him to a bloody tree 
 And He hung and bled 
 And died there just for me 
 He was not the same 
 Because He gave his life so freely, oh 
 He was God's Son 
 But as my world was spinning 'round 
 I saw His grace as it came down 
 To dwell within to make a change 
 Oh thank You Lord, I'm not the same 
 And now I'm not the same 
 Because the love He gives has changed me, oh 
 Now I walk in peace inside, oh 
 You know I'm not the same because 
 He placed His life within me, oh 
 Without a doubt I know I'm free, yeah, I am free 
 I am free, I am free, I am free

She calls out to the man on the street 
 Sir, can you help me 
 Its cold and I've nowhere to sleep 
 Is there somewhere you can tell me 
 He walks on, doesn't look back 
 He pretends he can't hear her 
 Starts to whistle as he crosses the street 
 Seems embarrassed to be there 
 Oh think twice, its another day for 
 You and me in paradise 
 Oh think twice, its just another day for you, 
 You and me in paradise 
 ...Just think about it 
 She calls out to the man on the street 
 He can see she's been crying 
 She's got blisters on the soles of her feet 
 Can't walk, but she's trying 
 Oh think twice, its another day for 
 You and me in paradise 
 Oh think twice, its just another day for you, 
 You and me in paradise 
 Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do 
 Oh Lord, there must be something you can say 
 You can tell from the lines on her face 
 You can see that she's been there 
 Probably been moved on from every place 
 'Cause she didn't fit in there 
 Oh think twice, its another day for 
 You and me in paradise 
 Oh think twice, its just another day for you, 
 You and me in paradise (x2) 
 Think about it 
 Just think about it 
 Won't you, won't you please 
 It's another day, for you and me in paradise 
 It's just another day for you and me in paradise 
 It's another day for you and me in paradise 
 It's just another day for you and me in paradise 
 In paradise (x4)

I come on my knees 
 To lay down before You 
 Bringing all that I am 
 Longing only to know You 
 Seeking Your face 
 And not only Your hand 
 I find You embracing me 
 Just as I am 
 And I lift these songs 
 To You and You alone 
 As I sing to You 
 In my praises make Your home 
 To my audience of One 
 You are Father and You are Son 
 As Your Spirit flows free 
 Let it find within me 
 A heart that beats to praise You 
 And now just to know You more 
 Has become my great reward 
 To see Your kingdom come 
 And Your will be done 
 I only desire to be Yours, Lord 
 So what could I bring 
 To honor Your majesty 
 What song could I sing 
 That would move the heart of royalty 
 When all that I have 
 Is this life that You've given me 
 So Lord let me live for You 
 My song with humility 
 And Lord as the love song 
 Of my life is played 
 I have one desire 
 To bring glory to Your name 
 To my audience of One 
 You are Father and You are Son 
 As Your Spirit flows free 
 Let it find within me 
 A heart that beats to praise You 
 And now just to know You more 
 Has become my great reward 
 To see Your kingdom come 
 And Your will be done 
 I only desire to be Yours, Lord 
 And we lift these songs 
 To You and You alone 
 As we live for You 
 In our praises make Your home 
 To my audience of One 
 You are Father and You are Son 
 As Your Spirit flows free 
 Let it find within me 
 A heart that beats to praise You 
 And now just to know You more 
 Has become my great reward 
 To see Your kingdom come 
 And Your will be done 
 I only desire to be Yours, Lord 
 Yours alone 
 You alone, yeah

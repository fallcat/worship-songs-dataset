When you're lost and all alone 
 I will be your sure way home 
 When you're left out in the cold 
 I will be your shelter from the storm 
 When you're clouded by your doubts 
 When you're surrounded and there's no other way out 
 I will be all that you need 
 And I'm here for the asking 
 Yeah 
 Let me be your everything 
 Let me be your everything 
 Look at all that I will bring 
 In exchange for what you have 
 Let me be your everything 
 When you're wandering in the darkness 
 I will be the light that guides you 
 And when death is standing at your doorway 
 I will be the life inside you 
 When you face your deepest fears 
 When you can't see through all the tears 
 I will stay year after year 
 So patiently waiting 
 Here me saying 
 Let me be your everything 
 Let me be your everything 
 Look at all that I will bring 
 In exchange for what you have 
 Let me be your everything 
 So bring your sorrow, bring your shame 
 All your suffering and your pain 
 Don't you know the price is paid 
 If only you'll let me be 
 Neither height nor depth, nor life, nor death 
 The angels above or the demons beneath the sea 
 Could ever separate you from 
 The love in me, so won't you 
 Let me be your everything 
 Let me be your everything 
 Look at all that I will bring 
 In exchange for what you have 
 Let me be your everything 
 So bring your sorrow, bring your shame 
 All your suffering and your pain 
 Don't you know the price is paid 
 If only you'll let me be 
 If only you'll let me be 
 Let me be your everything 
 Your everything 
 Yeah

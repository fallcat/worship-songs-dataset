Through the fire 
 And through the rain 
 Through the heartache 
 And deepest pain 
 All my laughter 
 And all my tears 
 I give it all to you 
 Every Trial 
 And greatest gain 
 Every failure 
 And darkest stain 
 Every moment 
 Through all these years 
 I give it all to you 
 Take this broken life I bring 
 Make it a beautiful offering 
 All I am laid at your feet 
 Make me a beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering to you 
 Every season 
 And every step 
 Every heartbeat 
 And every breathe 
 Every bible that brought me here 
 I give it all to you 
 Take this broken life I bring 
 Make it a beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering 
 Your love changes everything 
 Make me a beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering 
 You have ransomed all I am 
 And now all I am is Yours 
 You have ransomed all I am 
 Now all I am is Yours 
 Take this broken life I bring 
 Make it a beautiful offering 
 Your love changes everything 
 I am a beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering to you 
 Take this broken life I bring 
 Make it a beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering 
 Your love changes everything 
 I am a beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering 
 A beautiful offering 
 To You 
 A beautiful offering

Lately I've been busy thinkin' 
 And this is what's been on my mind 
 It seems like all I do is work for You, Lord 
 But I feel empty on the inside 
 I know that work is an important part 
 Oh but this is also true 
 My dilemma is an issue of the heart 
 When I try to live for you without you 
 I don't need to try to be 
 The flawless example 
 Lifted up for everyone to see 
 I don't need to stand and shout it 
 " Hey I've got the answer!" 
 If your presence is living in me 
 I won't need to talk about it 
 In a church committee 
 For the world to know the truth 
 All I need to do is just be me 
 Being in love with you 
 I've been spending all my time 
 And all my efforts trying 
 To make you proud of what you see 
 But to my great surprise 
 I have realized 
 Nothing that I do can change your love for me

Yesterday's forecast called for rain and I 
 Found all my so-called friends to be fair weather kind 
 Looking for shelter I was standing out in my pain 
 That's when You came and You changed everything 
 Cause April showers bring may flowers like 
 Only You turn my darkest hour into 
 Blue skies, blue skies 
 Not a cloud over head in my life 
 When it's grey out I don't mind 
 'Cause I've got blue skies 
 On the inside 
 Tossed about upon the stormy sea I swayed 
 Scared to death not at the wind but what I heard You say 
 It's not every time Your hand the wind will stay 
 Sometimes Your calling me to walk out on the waves 
 My perception should be a reflection not of what my eyes see but what Jesus tells me 
 I'm not sayin' I won't ever have a problem 
 Sometimes life's gonna rain on my parade 
 But if I know that You're right here with me then 
 Why should I worry, why should I be afraid 
 Outside when the rain is pourin' all around 
 I don't have to let it get me down

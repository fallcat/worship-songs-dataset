The word of the prophets, centuries old 
 The birth of Messiah has been long foretold 
 That unto you, now unto you 
 Christ is come, let all creation sing 
 God's own son, oh hail the newborn King 
 The word made flesh now dwells among us 
 Christ is come 
 Those born in darkness have seen a great light 
 The Redeemer of our hearts has been born this night 
 Now unto you, unto you 
 Christ is come, let all creation sing 
 God's own son, oh, hail the newborn King 
 The word made flesh now dwells among us 
 Christ is come 
 Prince of Peace, Yeshua, Messiah, the Son of Man 
 Holy One, King of kings, Lord of lords, the Great I Am 
 Comforter, Counselor, Author and Finisher 
 Divine Truth Revealer, Deliverer, Healer 
 You, our God, Jesus, You, our God 
 Christ is come, let all creation sing 
 God's own son, oh, hail the newborn King 
 The word made flesh, now dwells among us 
 Christ is come, Christ is come

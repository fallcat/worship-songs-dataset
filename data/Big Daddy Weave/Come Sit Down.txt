You're love, You're strength 
 You're mercy, You're grace 
 You're life, You're breath 
 You're heartbeat, You're face 
 We want to know You, we want to know You more 
 Come sit down 
 Rest here among us, say what You want to say 
 Come sit down, alive in Your presence 
 Lord come and take Your place 
 Come have the highest place 
 With just one touch, You make us new 
 With desperate hearts, we wait for You 
 We want to know You, we want to know You more 
 Come sit down 
 Rest here among us, say what You want to say 
 Come sit down, alive in Your presence 
 Lord come and take Your place 
 We lack nothing 
 We lack nothing 
 We lack nothing in You 
 Come sit down 
 Rest here among us, say what You want to say 
 Come sit down, alive in Your presence 
 Lord come and take Your place 
 Come sit down 
 Rest here among us, say what You want to say 
 Come sit down, alive in Your presence 
 Lord come and take Your place 
 Come have the highest place 
 We lack nothing 
 We lack nothing 
 We lack nothing in You 
 Come sit down 
 Rest here among us, say what You want to say 
 Come sit down, alive in Your presence 
 Lord come and take Your place 
 You are welcome here, Lord be honored here 
 Do what You can do, what only You can do 
 There's nothing impossible for You God 
 There's nothing impossible for You God 
 See our hearts and our lives bowed down 
 Come sit down 
 Rest here among us, say what You want to say 
 Come sit down, alive in Your presence 
 Lord come and take Your place 
 Come have the highest place 
 We lack nothing 
 We lack nothing 
 We lack nothing in You 
 Come sit down 
 Rest here among us, say what You want to say 
 Come sit down, alive in Your presence 
 Lord come and take Your place

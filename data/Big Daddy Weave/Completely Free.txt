Broken and poured out 
 For the love of His creation 
 God paid a debt 
 That He didn't owe 
 Bearing my pain 
 But not one was His equal 
 And wearing my shame 
 So that I could know Him 
 He gave us all 
 He had to give 
 So that we 
 Could truly live 
 So let's give all 
 We have to Him 
 So that we can be 
 Completely free 
 But as they placed 
 The thorns on His brow 
 As they drove the nails 
 Into His hands and His feet 
 He looked past the moment 
 To where we are now 
 And gave us the victory 
 From what seemed His defeat 
 (He said) Here's my body 
 It's broken in two 
 Here is my blood 
 Let it cover you 
 All that I have 
 Is now yours to receive 
 Payment in full 
 So that you can be free 
 He gave us all 
 He had to give 
 So that we 
 Could truly live 
 So let's give all 
 We have to Him 
 So that we can be 
 Completely 
 Oh, without a doubt 
 Completely 
 So that we can be 
 Completely free

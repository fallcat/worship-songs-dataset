I used to think that everyday before the day I met You had been wasted time 
 And there are places on that tape that I would so quickly erase if could just rewind 
 But that's not who I am anymore 
 'Cause there's no after without before 
 I see it in a different light 
 Now I understand the story of my life 
 Why You brought me to right here where I am tonight 
 Ooh I see it in a different light 
 And I took so many steps that led to nothing but regret and I still wear the scars 
 But all those pictures in my past now they're reminding me of just how beautiful You are 
 But that's not who I am anymore 
 'Cause there's no after without before 
 I see it in a different light 
 Now I understand the story of my life 
 Why You brought me to right here where I am tonight 
 Ooh I see it in a different light 
 I see it in a different light 
 Now I understand the story of my life 
 Why You brought me to right here where I am tonight 
 Ooh I see it in a different light, yes 
 Oh those old songs have a brand new sound 
 And oh my whole life's feeling new somehow 
 I see it in a different light, yeah yeah yeah 
 Ooh I see it in a different light 
 Now I understand the story of my life 
 Why You brought me to right here where I am tonight 
 Ooh I see it in a different light, yeah yeah 
 Ooh I see it in a different light 
 Now I understand the story of my life 
 Why You brought me to right here where I am tonight 
 Ooh I see it in a different light, yeah yeah... 
 I see it in a different light

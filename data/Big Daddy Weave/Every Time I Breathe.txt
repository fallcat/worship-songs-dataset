I am sure all of heaven's heard me cry 
 As I tell You all the reasons why 
 This life is just too hard 
 But day by day 
 Without fail 
 I'm finding everything I need 
 And everything that You are 
 To me 
 Every time I breathe You seem a little bit closer 
 I never want to leave 
 I want to stay in Your warm embrace 
 Oh basking in the glory shining from Your face 
 And every time I get another glimpse of Your heart 
 I realize it's true 
 That You are so marvelous God 
 And I am so in love with You 
 Now how could I after knowing One so great 
 Respond to You in any way 
 That's less than all I have to give 
 But by Your grace I want to love You not with what 
 I say 
 But everyday 
 In a way that my life is lived 
 Wrapped in Your mercy I want to live and never leave 
 I am held by how humble 
 Yet overwhelmed by Your majesty 
 Captured by grace and now I'm finding 
 I am free 
 You are marvelous God 
 And knowing You is everything

You are Holy 
 God of the Heavens 
 Almighty 
 Lord of Creation 
 You have power 
 The universe displays 
 All things fade away 
 But You remain 
 And Your mercies stretch across my life 
 As far as I can see 
 And I know from experience that You are good indeed 
 I stand here in amazement of Your awesome majesty 
 For words cannot describe, oh God 
 Everything You are to me 
 To me God, You are 
 You are Father 
 You called me Your very own 
 My redeemer 
 You left heaven's throne 
 My ransom 
 With blood for me you paid 
 So, one day unashamed 
 I'll see Your face 
 And Your mercies stretch across my life 
 As far as I can see 
 And I know from experience that You are good indeed 
 I stand here in amazement of Your awesome majesty 
 For words cannot describe, oh God 
 Everything You are to me 
 Indescribably good 
 Lord that's what You are to me 
 You are making me into 
 Just what You want me to be 
 You are Jesus 
 And I love You 
 Your mercies stretch across my life as far as I can see 
 And I know from experience that You are good indeed 
 I stand here in amazement of Your awesome majesty 
 For words cannot describe, oh God 
 Everything You are 
 I stand here in amazement of Your awesome majesty 
 For words cannot describe, oh God 
 Everything You are to me

It is good to praise You, Lord 
 To make music to Your holy name, Most High 
 Sing a song of Your love in the mornin' 
 And Your faithfulness, Your faithfulness at night 
 Your deeds have made me glad 
 I sing for joy at the work of Your hands 
 You turn my mournin' into dancin', God 
 And the foolish man just can't understand why 
 Oh, I just want to sing Your praise 
 You're exalted forever 
 Oh, let all heaven and earth proclaim 
 You're exalted forever, God, yeah

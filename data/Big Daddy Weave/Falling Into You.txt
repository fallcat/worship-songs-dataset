You say, "Don't worry" 
 I say, "I'll try not to, 
 But it seems like I'm just pre- disposed" 
 You say "Just trust me" 
 I say, "I'd love to but 
 I keep having trouble letting go" 
 What I've got might not seem like much 
 But I'm scared of losing it all 
 I'm standing on the edge of so much more 
 And I'm about to take the fall 
 I'm falling into You 
 And all Your mysterious ways 
 Draw me into You 
 And Your unfailing grace 
 This is the end of me 
 My heart is willing but this flesh is weak 
 It's like I'm paralyzed by what I think I know 
 I'm waiting on You to come and rescue me 
 But it's up to me to let you have control 
 What I've got might not seem like much 
 But I'm scared of losing it all 
 I'm standing on the edge of so much more 
 And I'm about to take the fall 
 This is where I end this is where You begin 
 This is where I end 
 I'm letting go of me 
 I'm trusting You to be all that I need 
 I'm letting go of me and falling into You

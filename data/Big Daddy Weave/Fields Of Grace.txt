There's a place that I love to run and play 
 There's a place that I sing new songs of praise 
 Dancing with my Father God in fields of Grace 
 There's a place that I lose myself within 
 There's a place I find myself again 
 Dancin' with my Father God in fields of Grace 
 There's a place where religion finally dies 
 There's a place that I lose my selfish pride 
 Dancin' with my Father God in fields of Grace 
 I love my Father, my Father loves me 
 I dance for my Father, my Father sings over me 
 And nothing can take that away from me 
 Dancin' with my Father God in fields of Grace

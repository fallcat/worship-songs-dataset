Totally, Completely, 
 Entirely amazing 
 That the unseen has become seen 
 And is to me unfailing 
 You are the Lord, The Father of lights 
 You are God the Keeper of my heart 
 And I praise You, and I praise You 
 You are the Lover of my soul 
 You are the Giver of the second start 
 And I praise You, for who You are 
 Seems too high for me to reach 
 To wrap my mind around the mystery 
 That who You are so constantly 
 Is who You're making me to be 
 You are the Lord, The Father of lights 
 You are God the Keeper of my heart 
 And I praise You, and I praise You 
 You are the Lover of my soul 
 You are the Giver of the second start 
 And I praise You, for who You are 
 And who You are does not rely on what I'm currently surrounded by 
 You're teaching me to fly, teach me to fly so high 
 You are the Lord, The Father of the lights 
 You are God, and the Keeper of my heart 
 And I praise You, and I praise You 
 You are the Lover of my soul 
 You are the Giver of the second start 
 And I praise You, for who You are 
 Yeah, for who you are (4x)

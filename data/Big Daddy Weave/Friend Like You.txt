I woke up this morning 
 And looked out my window 
 I could see the sun shining down on me 
 It reminded me of You 
 And of all that You do 
 And of all the love that You've shown to me 
 Thank You Lord 
 Oh thank You Lord 
 I am so thankful for a friend like You 
 Your mercy oh Lord is new every morning 
 Your wisdom is waiting for me to ask 
 Though I might stumble 
 Though I lose my step now 
 Your grace is gonna cover what I lack 
 Thank You Lord 
 Oh thank You Lord 
 I am so thankful for a friend like You 
 Jesus Your love is better than life to me 
 Your goodness is always by my side 
 And why You love me is hard for me to see 
 But I love You Lord 'cause You've been so good to me 
 Thank You Lord 
 Oh thank You Lord 
 I am so thankful for a friend like You 
 Though I may never be a scholar with a fancy degree 
 One thing I know for sure is that I love You 
 And You love me Lord 
 Thank You Lord 
 Oh thank You Lord 
 I am so thankful for a friend like You 
 A friend like You (repeat)

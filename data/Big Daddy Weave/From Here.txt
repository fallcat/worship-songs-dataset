My child, I've hoped and I've prayed for this very day 
 Since you were just a little one 
 And oh how my heart swells with pride 
 As I watch the man that you've become 
 But this life offers no guarantees 
 And though my time on this earth had to end 
 I'm sure that your heart would know peace 
 If you could just see where I am 
 From here, the race has been run and love's already won 
 I see clearly the end and the start 
 From here, I'm cheering you on 
 So live out each breath with all that you've got 
 And know until I hold you close 
 I'll be holding you dear in my heart 
 From here 
 I've seen your tears as you've waited alone 
 Longing for that special one 
 And now all the waiting is done 
 As you gaze into her eyes 
 Seeing the reflection of love 
 Life's road may seem rough up ahead 
 And for now you see only in part 
 So hold onto each other and know 
 That there is an end to the dark 
 Heaven is calling and my heart keeps longing 
 Looking so forward to the day 
 When we'll be together forever in eternity 
 Just you wait and see

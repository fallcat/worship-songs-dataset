I earn it just to spend it, throw it out when it's broken 
 Like a hamster on the wheel I keep making the spokes spin 
 Do I have what I have or does it have me 
 There's only one way to know I can be free 
 I wanna give my life away 
 I wanna give my life away 
 Move every little thing standing in the way 
 Oh I wanna give my life away, hey yeah 
 It's hard to believe when you're scared of what might be 
 But you'll never find what you need hanging on so tightly 
 Because life's not the kind of gift that you can hold 
 The only way you can keep it is to let it go 
 I wanna give my life away 
 I wanna give my life away 
 Move every little thing standing in the way 
 Oh I wanna give my life away, hey yeah 
 I wanna give my life away 
 'Cause I know that's what You want me to do 
 Wanna give myself to You 
 Gonna give my life away 
 I've been changed by the Truth 
 If I give myself away 
 I'll find myself in You 
 I wanna give my life away 
 I wanna give my life away 
 Move every little thing standing in the way 
 Oh I wanna give my life away 
 I wanna give my life away 
 I wanna give my life away 
 Move every little thing standing in the way 
 Oh I wanna give my life away, yeah yeah 
 Ooh yeah yeah 
 Oh yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah ooh yeah

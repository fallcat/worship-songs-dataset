Desperate. Grasping with a clenched fist. 
 I try to hold my own life in my own hand 
 Frustration sets in, thought I had this 
 Failure is the one thing that I can't stand 
 Oh, You remind me that taking care of me 
 Was never in my job description. 
 Oh, now I'm finding You want 
 To fix it all 
 You're just waiting for permission 
 I'm giving up, I'm letting go 
 Of everything that I've held onto 
 I'm giving up, I'm letting go 
 Of everything that I've let hold me 
 Far too long (for so long) Lord I know 
 I need to give You full control 
 Help me give up and let go 
 I want to trust You with my whole heart 
 Not lean on what I think I understand 
 And even when I can't see 
 Jesus, help me still to believe 
 You're unveiling an unfailing plan 
 Oh, but sometimes the old me creeps back in 
 Oh, and the only thing I know to do is give it all to You again 
 Help me give up, help me let go 
 Help me give up, help me let go 
 Help me give it all to You

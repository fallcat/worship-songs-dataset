What's wrong with the world 
 It's falling apart, we're running deeper into the dark 
 Calling right wrong, and calling wrong right 
 Please don't believe the lie 
 Keep holding on to the promise 
 We have a home beyond this 
 We're gonna be home soon 
 Tell people everywhere 
 In the struggle hold on because we're almost there 
 It only hurts for a little while 
 But in a moment we'll see his glory unspeakable 
 What's wrong with the world so much suffering 
 We can't see past our broken hearts 
 But if we look to the King who is soon coming 
 Joy will never fall 
 Keep holding on to the promise 
 We have a home beyond this 
 We're gonna be home soon 
 Tell people everywhere 
 In the struggle hold on because we're almost there 
 It only hurts for a little while 
 But in a moment we'll see his glory unspeakable 
 How I long for the day when this all fades away 
 And I look on the face of the One who saves 
 I'll lift up my eyes to his glorious light 
 See the promise of heaven revealed in my life 
 We're gonna be home soon 
 Tell people everywhere 
 In the struggle hold on because we're almost there 
 It only hurts for a little while 
 But in a moment we'll see his glory unspeakable 
 We're gonna be home soon 
 Tell people everywhere 
 In the struggle hold on because we're almost there 
 It only hurts for a little while 
 But in a moment we'll see his glory unspeakable 
 Oh in a moment we'll see his glory unspeakable

While shepherds kept their watching 
 O'er silent flocks by night 
 Behold throughout the heavens 
 There shone a holy light, shone a holy light 
 The shepherds feared and trembled 
 When lo, above the earth 
 Rang out the angel chorus 
 That hailed our Savior's birth 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born today, today 
 Down in a lowly manger 
 The humble Christ was born 
 And God sent our salvation 
 That blessed Christmas morn 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 Hallelujah 
 (Jesus Christ the Lord is born) 
 Hallelujah 
 (Jesus Christ is born) 
 (Jesus Christ is born today) 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Jesus Christ is born today, today, today 
 Jesus Christ is born

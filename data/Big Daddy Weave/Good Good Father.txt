Well I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like 
 And I've heard the tender whispers of love in the dead of night 
 Well you tell me that you're pleased and that I'm never alone 
 You're a Good, Good Father 
 It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are 
 And I'm loved by you 
 It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am 
 Well I've seen many searching for answers far and wide 
 But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide 
 Cause you know just what we need before we say a word 
 You're a Good, Good Father 
 It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are 
 And I'm loved by you 
 It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am 
 You're a Good, Good Father 
 It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are

 You are perfect in all of your ways 
 You are perfect in all of your ways to us 
 You are perfect in all of your ways 
 You are perfect in all of your ways 
 You are perfect in all of your ways to us 
 Oh Love so undeniable 
 I, I can hardly speak 
 And peace so unexplainable 
 I, I can hardly think 
 But you call us deeper still 
 And you call us deeper still 
 God you call us deeper still into love, love, love 
 You're a Good, Good Father

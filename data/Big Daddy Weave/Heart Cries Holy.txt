Standing here in the presence 
 Of something more that merely real 
 There are no words to describe you 
 Or explain the way I feel 
 As you speak I find healing for my soul 
 And your touch alone can make me whole. 
 And my heart cries Holy 
 And my spirit feels a change 
 As my heart cries Holy 
 I will never be the same 
 Your mercies toward me last forever 
 Your faithfulness is true 
 And as you touch the coal to my lips 
 My mind is made brand new 
 I could never repay all that you've done 
 So use my life to the glory of your Son 
 And my heart cries Holy 
 And my spirit feels a change 
 As my heart cries Holy 
 I will never be the same 
 Everything inside of me 
 Everything untrue 
 Oh, Lord I surrender 
 All of it to You 
 Yeah, Yeah 
 And my heart cries Holy 
 And my spirit feels a change 
 As my heart cries Holy 
 I will never be the same

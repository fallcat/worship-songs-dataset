A world full of people 
 In a world full of darkness 
 Constantly searching 
 Searching for truth 
 So shout it from the rooftops 
 The Truth has come 
 His name is Jesus 
 And He loves you 
 If you listen you can hear Him call your name 
 His name is Jesus 
 He gave His life for you 
 And to know Him is to never be the same 
 So many choices 
 So much confusion 
 No sense of direction 
 Don't know which way to turn 
 The Father paved the way for us 
 It's through His Son 
 His name is Jesus 
 And He loves you 
 If you listen you can hear Him call your name 
 His name is Jesus 
 He gave His life for you 
 And to know Him is to never be the same 
 For the one who is broken 
 The one who is lost 
 There is life to be found 
 At the foot of an old rugged cross 
 His name is Jesus 
 And He loves you 
 If you listen you can hear Him call your name 
 His name is Jesus 
 He gave His life for you 
 And to know Him is to never be the same 
 Once you know Him you will never be the same 
 His name is Jesus (x4)

"Well sometimes my life just don't make sense at all 
 When the mountains look so big 
 And my faith just seems so small 
 So hold me Jesus 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace 
 And I wake up in the night and feel the dark 
 It's so hot inside my soul 
 I swear there must be blisters on my heart 
 So hold me Jesus 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace 
 Surrender don't come natural to me 
 I'd rather fight You for something I don't really want 
 Than to take what You give that I need 
 And I've beat my head against so many walls 
 Now I'm falling down I'm falling on my knees 
 And this Salvation Army band is playing this hymn 
 And Your grace rings out so deep 
 It makes my resistance seem so thin 
 I'm singing hold me Jesus 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace"

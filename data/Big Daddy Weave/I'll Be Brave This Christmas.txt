Dear daddy, I missed you today 
 When mama unpacked out old Christmas tree 
 And that sweet angel never looked so good on top 
 But my heart felt sad when you weren't there to lift me 
 It's been a while since you went off to fight the war 
 So this year it won't be presents I'll be wishing for 
 I'll be brave this Christmas 
 While you're still far away 
 And I'll kneel beside my bed each night 
 Praying Jesus keeps you safe 
 'Cause I'm so proud of you, I hope you come home soon 
 But until you do, I'll be brave this Christmas 
 I see bright colors light up the Wilson's house 
 While rockets flash across your evening sky 
 And we sing carols, ooh, all over town 
 While you're living out the cost of peace on earth tonight 
 But if another little boy can grow up just like me 
 Living in a land that's safe and free 
 I'll be brave this Christmas 
 While you're still far away 
 And I'll kneel beside my bed each night 
 Praying Jesus keeps you safe 
 'Cause I'm so proud of you, I hope you come home soon 
 But until you do, I'll be brave this Christmas 
 Freedom isn't free, there's a price to pay when duty calls 
 It takes sacrifice from us all 
 So I'll be brave this Christmas 
 While your still far away 
 And I'll kneel beside my bed each night 
 Praying Jesus keeps you safe 
 'Cause we're all so proud of you and I hope you come home soon 
 But until you do, I'll be brave this Christmas 
 Ooh, this Christmas, I'll be brave

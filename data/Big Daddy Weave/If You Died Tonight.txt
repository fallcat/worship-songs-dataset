I don't have it all together 
 Sometimes I find myself asking why oh why 
 But I know we don't have forever 
 So I'd be a fool to let this moment pass us by 
 So at the risk of sounding crazy let me ask you 
 If you died tonight, where would you be 
 Where would your soul spend eternity 
 Jesus gave His life 
 If you'd just believe, it changes everything 
 If you died tonight 
 So you can call me narrow minded 
 But I believe that in your heart there lies the proof 
 And if you look down deep you'll find it 
 An empty place that is pointing to the Truth 
 You can hear His voice inside you 
 Gently asking 
 If you died tonight, where would you be 
 Where would your soul spend eternity 
 Jesus gave His life 
 If you'd just believe, it changes everything 
 If you died tonight 
 Say I need You 
 I can't live without You 
 Come and fill my life with Your glory, God 
 Say I need You 
 I can't live without You 
 Come and fill my life with Your glory 
 Say I need You 
 I can't live without You 
 Come and fill my life with Your glory 
 Say I need You 
 I can't live without You 
 Come and fill my life with Your glory 
 If you died tonight, where would you be 
 Where would your soul spend eternity 
 Jesus gave His life 
 If you'd just believe, it changes everything 
 If you died tonight 
 If you died tonight, where would you be 
 Where would your soul spend eternity 
 Jesus gave His life 
 If you'd just believe, it changes everything 
 If you died tonight 
 If you died tonight 
 If you died tonight

Well, I may not be the greatest man to walk this earth 
 But I know who is 
 And I may not amount to what you think is much 
 But I already do to Him 
 While people keep searching for answers 
 Looking for a light in the dark 
 I'm standing with the answer 
 Cause He is living in my heart 
 In Christ I can do all things 
 In Christ I mount up on eagle's wings 
 In Christ I wait for a great reward 
 That I have in store in Christ 
 Well you might think that I'm sounding all too prideful 
 But let me tell you something true 
 The very One who lives inside of me right now 
 Wants to live inside of you 
 Instead of searching any longer 
 You can have peace today 
 You can take hold of the answer 
 Then you'll be able to say 
 In Christ I can do all things 
 In Christ I mount up on eagle's wings 
 In Christ I wait for a great reward 
 That I have in store 
 In Christ I have His righteousness 
 In Christ I have what I confess 
 In Christ I don't worry about all the rest 
 'Cause everything I need to be 
 In Him we live and move 
 And in Him we have our being 
 As we all live in Him 
 Together we can sing 
 In Christ I can do all things 
 In Christ I mount up on eagle's wings 
 In Christ I wait for a great reward 
 That I have in store 
 In Christ I have His righteousness 
 In Christ I have what I confess 
 In Christ I don't worry about all the rest 
 'Cause everything I need to be 
 Everything I need to be 
 Everything I need to be 
 Everything I need to be is in Christ 
 It's in Christ

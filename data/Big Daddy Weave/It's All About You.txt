It's not about me 
 It's all about You 
 It's not about my pride 
 It's all about Your truth 
 And so right here from the start 
 I open up my heart 
 And say Lord here's every part 
 'Cause it's all about You (2x) 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, it's all about You (2x) 
 It's not about me 
 It's all about You 
 It's not about my pride 
 It's all about Your truth 
 And so right here from the start 
 I open up my heart 
 And say Lord here's every part 
 'Cause it's all about You 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, it's all about You (4x) 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, it's all about You (2x) 
 It's all about You

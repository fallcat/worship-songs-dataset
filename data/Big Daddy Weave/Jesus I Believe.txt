I wanna walk with You Jesus 
 Feel your presence 
 And know You're near 
 I wanna see You Jesus 
 Move in power 
 And cast out fear 
 I need to hear You now 
 I need to know it's You 
 I'm standing on your promises 
 I know your Word is true 
 You're beginning what I see 
 It's You and its change for me 
 'Cause even the impossible can be reality 
 Jesus I believe 
 Jesus I believe 
 I wanna say what You're saying 
 Speaking life to what is dead 
 And I wanna cling to You Jesus 
 Uh, hanging on your every breath 
 I need to hear You now 
 I need to know it's You 
 I'm standing on your promises 
 I know your Words are true 
 You're beginning what I see 
 That it's You and its change for me 
 'Cause even the impossible is your reality 
 Jesus I believe 
 Jesus I believe 
 So let your kingdom come 
 And let your will be done 
 Here on the earth 
 Just like it is in heaven 
 God let your kingdom come 
 And let your will be done 
 Right here on earth 
 Just like it is heaven 
 I need to hear You now 
 I need to know it's You 
 I'm standing on your promises 
 I know your Word is true 
 You're beginning what I see 
 It's You and its change for me 
 'Cause even the impossible is your reality 
 I need to hear You now 
 I need to know it's You 
 I'm standing on your promises 
 I know your Words are true 
 You're beginning what I see 
 It's You and its change for me 
 'Cause even the impossible is your reality 
 God even the impossible is your reality 
 Jesus I believe 
 Jesus I believe 
 Help my unbelief God 
 Jesus I believe

Hiding out in this cave for better than forty days 
 Don't know how much more 'cause it's been just that long 
 Seasons came and they've gone but still I remain 
 So sick of singing the same sad song 
 When the foundation's already been laid 
 Now all that's left for me to do is to choose to embrace following You 
 Stepping out from the old into the new 
 I'll be following right here behind You 
 You set me free to be myself but 
 The me in Your heart looks 
 Just like somebody else 
 Wasted years of my life worried over how 
 I could ever meet such expectations 
 But none of my former fears seem to matter now 
 That who I am is found within Your Son 
 My identity has been replaced 
 Bought with Your blood 
 I am completely covered by Your grace 
 To walk by faith 
 Stepping out from the old into the new 
 I'll be following right here behind You 
 You set me free to be myself but 
 The me in Your heart looks 
 Just like somebody else 
 Stepping out from the old into the new 
 I'll be following right here inside You 
 Who I was just don't mean much 
 When the me in Your heart looks just like Jesus 
 I don't want anything from this life that You don't want for me 
 I don't want anything from this life that You don't want for me 
 I don't want anything from this life that You don't want for me 
 So won't you come and make me into just who You want me to be

Sneakin' 'round after midnight 
 There's no one there to see me 
 Participating on the wrong side 
 Then I hear a voice in my mind 
 When I see you running away 
 It makes me wanna cry 
 When I see you 
 Reminding me of the day I had to die 
 Don't you know that in My heart I still can feel the pain 
 'Cause when I see you it's like killing Me again 
 A Holy King is returning 
 It could be any time 
 He's coming back for a spotless bride 
 Not for those who've got something they're trying to hide

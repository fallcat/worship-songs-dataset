I've been restless on the inside wondering about this heart of mine 
 I've been desperately trying to find a way to prove that I'm still alive 
 Has the love I speak of 
 So loudly of quietly grown cold 
 Is my life been an empty voice what I sing needs to be seen 
 I need to step out and make the choice 
 To let go of everything 
 Would you reignite this heart spark here in the dark 
 Bring your love to life inside of me 
 Why don't you break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet 
 For the hopeless and the broken for the ones 
 That don't know that you love them, bring your love to life inside of me 
 The generation you're calling out living everything we sing about 
 The revelation right here and now, love beyond the shadow of the doubt 
 Love that is greater than our own 
 Won't remain unknown 
 When you bring your love to life inside of me 
 Why don't you break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet 
 For the hopeless and the broken for the ones 
 That don't know that you love them, bring your love to life inside of me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me 
 Bring your love to life inside of me 
 Why don't you break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet 
 For the hopeless and the broken for the ones 
 That don't know that you love them, bring your love to life inside of me 
 Bring your love to life inside of me 
 Why don't you break my heart 'til it moves my hands and feet 
 For the hopeless and the broken for the ones 
 That don't know that you love them, bring your love to life inside of me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me 
 Love to come life, love to come life 
 Bring love to life inside me

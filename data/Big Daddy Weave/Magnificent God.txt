When darkness clouds the day 
 When we are afraid 
 You are there 
 When trouble closes in 
 It's hard to trust again 
 You are there 
 And we fix our eyes on You 
 Our hope is found in You 
 You are Glorious, Almighty 
 Infinite and Holy 
 Gracious, Full of Mercy 
 Love without an end 
 Magnificent God, Magnificent God 
 Our hearts are full of wonder 
 Captured by Your beauty 
 Falling on our knees we worship You alone 
 Magnificent God, We bow before all You are 
 Gathered in this place to glorify Your Name 
 You are here 
 Your Presence is revealed as hearts are being healed 
 You are here 
 And we lift our eyes to You 
 Our hope is found in You

Dark skies overhead and I remember what You said, 
 That You would never leave 
 Rough waters all around but here I am on solid ground 
 As You reach down to me 
 And if You are on my side, whom shall I fear 
 And I know the Maker of the wind 
 The Master of the waves 
 Forgiver of my sin 
 And I know the One who holds my hope 
 So I won't be afraid when storms come blowing in 
 I know the Maker of the wind 
 When trouble finds me, sneaks up behind me 
 It trips me up and it makes me fall 
 But when I'm broken then You remind me 
 That You have overcome it all 
 And I know the Maker of the wind 
 The Master of the waves 
 Forgiver of my sin 
 And I know the One who holds my hope 
 So I won't be afraid when storms come blowing in 
 I know the Maker of the wind 
 You know the number of my days 
 And what I need to understand 
 God I can trust in You as long as I can say 
 That I know the Maker of the wind 
 The Master of the waves 
 Forgiver of my sin 
 That I know the Maker of the wind 
 The Master of the waves 
 Forgiver of my sin 
 And I know the One who holds my hope 
 So I won't be afraid when storms come blowing in 
 I know the Maker of the wind 
 The make of the wind yeah 
 So let the wind blow

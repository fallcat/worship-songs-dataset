If I told you my story 
 You would hear hope that wouldn't let go 
 If I told you my story 
 You would hear love that never gave up 
 If I told you my story 
 You would hear life but it wasn't mine 
 If I should speak then let it be 
 Of the grace that is greater than all my sin 
 Of when justice was served and where mercy wins 
 Of the kindness of Jesus that draws me in 
 To tell you my story is to tell of Him 
 If I told you my story 
 You would hear victory over the enemy 
 If told you my story 
 You would hear freedom that was won for me 
 If I told you my story 
 You would hear life overcome the grave 
 If I should speak then let it be 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long

Hanging by a thread 
 From the tree 
 Of this life 
 I've been spinning 
 Round and round and round 
 Inside my flesh cocoon 
 An old beat up Pinto 
 Might be what I drive for now 
 But I'll be driving a Cadillac soon 
 Cause you know one day I will fly 
 To my mansion in the sky 
 And I'll have no regrets 
 When I leave this place 
 For good 
 When I say my last farewell 
 Oh, please don't forget to tell them 
 That I'm not really dead 
 I'm just changing neighborhoods 
 Living in this place 
 That is only temporary 
 I said that this old world 
 Is in the process of slipping away 
 Though I have such a future 
 I've got to be wary 
 That my bright tomorrow doesn't blind me 
 To what God has for me today 
 Cause you know one day I will fly 
 To my mansion in the sky 
 And I'll have no regrets 
 When I leave this place 
 For good 
 When I say my last farewell 
 Oh, please don't forget to tell them 
 That I'm not really dead 
 I'm just changing neighborhoods 
 Cause you know one day I will fly 
 To my mansion in the sky 
 And I'll have no regrets 
 When I leave this place 
 For good 
 When I say my last farewell 
 Oh, please don't forget to tell them 
 That I'm not really dead 
 I'm just changing neighborhoods

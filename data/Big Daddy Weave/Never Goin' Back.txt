Close the door to be sure 
 As I take a new direction 
 I leave behind my former ways 
 And cast aside this world's affections 
 And I won't think twice because 
 Your love healed my broken heart, now 
 And your love bought me a brand new start 
 Oh, a brand new start, yeah 
 And I'm never goin' back, no way, yeah 
 The wisdom of the cross is foolish 
 To the one who won't receive it 
 But there is power just the same 
 To all who will believe it 
 I believe it because 
 (Never goin' back) To that old place 
 (Never goin' back) Since my past has been erased 
 (Never goin' back) In His grace I will remain 
 (Never goin' back) To my old ways 
 You healed my broken heart, now 
 And your love bought me a brand new start 
 I said that your love healed my broken heart, now 
 And your love bought me a brand new start 
 Oh, a brand new start, yeah 
 And I'm never goin' back, no way, yeah

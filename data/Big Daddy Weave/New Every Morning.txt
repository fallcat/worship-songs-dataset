Strangers are attacking me 
 Ruthless, they seek to steal my life 
 They have no regard for You Lord 
 Vindicate me by Your might 
 Though the darkness tries to steal my heart 
 It comes without warning 
 But Your mercy covers me because 
 It's new every morning 
 It's new every morning 
 I place my trust in Your holy blood 
 To cleanse and protect me from all my sin 
 Though the enemy rushes in 
 Your spirit will lift up a standard against him 
 Though the darkness tries to steal my heart 
 It comes without warning 
 But Your mercy covers me because 
 It's new every morning 
 When the darkness tries to steal my heart 
 It comes without warning 
 But Your mercy covers me because 
 It's new every morning 
 Though the darkness tries to steal my heart 
 It comes without warning 
 But Your mercy covers me because 
 It's new every morning 
 When the darkness tries to steal my heart 
 It comes without warning 
 But Your mercy covers me because 
 It's new every morning 
 It's new every morning. 
 You mercy is new every morning.

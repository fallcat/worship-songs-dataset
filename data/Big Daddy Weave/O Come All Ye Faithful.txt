O come all ye faithful 
 Joyful and triumphant 
 Come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem 
 Come and behold Him 
 Born the King of angels 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord 
 O sing, choirs of angels 
 Sing in exultation 
 Sing all ye citizens of Heaven above 
 Glory to God 
 All glory in the highest 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord 
 Every nation will bow down before You 
 Every tongue will confess You are God 
 We worship and adore You 
 We worship and adore 
 Ye Lord, we greet Thee 
 Born this happy morning 
 Jesus to Thee be all glory given 
 Word of the Father 
 Now in flesh appearing 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord

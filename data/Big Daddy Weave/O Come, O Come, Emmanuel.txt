O come, O come, Emmanuel, 
 And ransom captive Israel, 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the Son of God appear. 
 Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by thine advent here; 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight. 
 Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 Rejoice! Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O come, Desire of nations, bind 
 All people in one heart and mind; 
 Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease; 
 Fill the whole world with heaven's peace. 
 Rejoice!  Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 Rejoice!  Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel!

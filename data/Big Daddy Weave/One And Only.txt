Yeah, Yeah 
 Well I am standing in the field 
 Firmly planted like a tree 
 And though my roots grow deep, 
 I still sway from side to side 
 When the wind blows by 
 And this whole world keeps pulling me 
 But inside I know the truth 
 No matter what this life can give, 
 I know my heart was made to live for One, 
 It wasn't made for two 
 When you come to me 
 Questioning priority 
 Lord, let me drop everything and answer You... 
 Yes Lord, You are, You are, my One and Only (2x) 
 Nah nah nah nah nah... 
 It is still hard to believe 
 That You look past all the flaws in me 
 You see through the outside part, 
 To the motives of my heart 
 There is nothing I can't hide 
 So come and take away 
 Every thought that disobeys 
 Until my response to You is truthfully... this... (Chorus) 
 Remind me, Lord 
 That You are a jealous God 
 Then my heart will truly say... (Chorus 2x)

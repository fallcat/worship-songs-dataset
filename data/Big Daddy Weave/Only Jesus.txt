Who could ever find the words 
 To describe the Indescribable 
 Limited vocabulary falls 
 So short of depicting You, God 
 Yet I'm distracted, the things 
 Of this world threaten to pull me apart 
 But in Your mercy You hear 
 The cry of my heart 
 Only Jesus, only Jesus 
 Lord, I'm tired of all the rest 
 When my heart knows You are best 
 Only Jesus, only Jesus 
 A Son of God and Son of Man who 
 Came to destroy the work of sin 
 And it's work in me was crushed when 
 You became the way for me 
 Help me surrender and stop pretending 
 That I can live on my own 
 I'll find who I am wrapped up in You alone 
 Only Jesus, only Jesus 
 Lord, I'm tired of all the rest 
 When my heart knows You are best 
 Only Jesus 
 Come and change, Lord 
 Rearrange every part of me 
 Until You are all that can be seen 
 Come, be seen in me 
 Only Jesus, only Jesus 
 Lord, I'm tired of all the rest 
 When my heart knows You are the very best 
 Only Jesus 
 I'm tired of all the rest 
 When my heart knows You are the very best 
 Only Jesus, only Jesus 
 Only Jesus, only Jesus, only Jesus

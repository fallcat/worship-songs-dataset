I see the work of Your Hands 
 Galaxies spin in a Heavenly dance oh God 
 All that You are is so overwhelming 
 I hear the sound of Your Voice 
 All at once it's a gentle and thundering noise oh God 
 All that You are is so overwhelming 
 I delight myself in You 
 Captivated by Your beauty 
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You 
 God, I run into Your arms 
 Unashamed because of mercy 
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You 
 I know the power of Your Cross 
 Forgiven and free forever You'll be my God 
 And all that You've done is so overwhelming 
 I delight myself in You 
 In the Glory of Your Presence 
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You 
 And God I run into Your arms 
 Unashamed because of mercy 
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You 
 You are Beautiful, You are Beautiful 
 Oh God, there is no one more Beautiful 
 You are Beautiful, God you are the most Beautiful 
 You are Wonderful, You are Wonderful 
 Oh God, there is no one more Wonderful 
 You are Wonderful, God You are the most Wonderful 
 You are Glorious, You are Glorious 
 Oh God, there is no one more Glorious 
 You are Glorious, God you are the most Glorious 
 I delight myself in You 
 In the Glory of Your Presence 
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You 
 And God I run into Your arms 
 Unashamed because of mercy 
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You 
 I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You 
 There is no one more Beautiful 
 You are the most Beautiful

Hear no evil, see no evil 
 Speak no evil 
 On the outside 
 Full of pride, full of lies 
 So well they hide 
 On the inside 
 They'll never be 
 All that they seem 
 They live the life of a Pharisee 
 Not perfect on the surface 
 So far to go 
 On the outside 
 But a true heart 
 And a new start is what lives on the inside 
 For whom the Son has set free 
 He is free 
 Free indeed 
 Receive the Son who makes us free 
 Then you will be free indeed 
 Receive the Son who makes us free 
 Then you will be free

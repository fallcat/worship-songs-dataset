Seems like all I could see was the struggle 
 Haunted by ghosts that lived in my past 
 Bound up in shackles of all my failures 
 Wondering how long is this gonna last 
 Then You look at this prisoner and say to me 
 "Son, stop fighting a fight that's already been won" 
 I am redeemed 
 You set me free 
 So I'll shake off theses heavy chains 
 And wipe away every stain 
 Now I'm not who I used to be 
 I am redeemed 
 I am redeemed 
 All my life I have been called unworthy 
 Named by the voice of my shame and regret 
 But when I hear You whisper, "Child lift up your head" 
 I remember oh God, You're not done with me yet 
 I don't have to be 
 The old man inside of me 
 'Cause his day is long dead and gone 
 Because I've got a new name 
 A new life I'm not the same 
 And a hope that will carry me home

To all who are weary and those who are heavy laden 
 Lay at the feet of the one who loves you best 
 Bring all of your trials and all of your tribulation 
 Come unto me and I will give you rest 
 I will give you rest 
 Take my yoke upon you 
 Come and learn from me 
 For I am humble in spirit and so you must also be 
 Lo I will be with you in the midst of every test 
 If you run unto me, I will give you rest 
 I will give you rest

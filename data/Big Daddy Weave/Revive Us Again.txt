We praise You oh God for the Son of Your love 
 For Jesus who died and is now gone above 
 We praise You oh God for Your Spirit of Light 
 Who has shown us our Savior and scattered our night 
 Hallelujah Thine the glory 
 Hallelujah, Amen 
 Hallelujah Thine the glory 
 Revive us again 
 All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain 
 Who has born all our sin and has cleansed ever stain 
 Revive us again, fill our hearts with Your love 
 And may our souls be rekindled with fire from above 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen

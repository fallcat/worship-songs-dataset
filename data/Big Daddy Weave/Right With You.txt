I was with her we were talking over dinner just the other night 
 When had quite the fight, me and my lovely wife 
 Arguing over position neither one of us would listen to the other side 
 A gross display of pride about who was wrong or right 
 But now it all seems silly 
 When we know what's important really 
 It's okay, it's all right if I don't get my way tonight 
 Just as long as I'm right with you 
 I was standing looking out across the canyon between You and I 
 A million miles too wide for me to reach the other side 
 In deep depression broken over my rejection I failed to realize 
 To my great surprise, You'd paved a way with Your own life 
 I accept the invitation 
 To become Your new creation 
 It's okay, it's all right if I don't get my way tonight 
 Just as long as I'm right with You 
 Either way we'll be fine if we leave this pride behind 
 Just as long as I'm right with You

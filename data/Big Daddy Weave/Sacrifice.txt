God of Glory, God of Might 
 King of Heaven, Lord of Light 
 Though my ways are less than wise 
 I come to praise You 
 Jesus, Master, Savior, Friend 
 Your mercy seems to have no end 
 And though all I have to bring is sin 
 I come to praise You 
 And my righteousness, is as filthy rags 
 But You exchange them for the good things that You have 
 Lord I want to sing... 
 I wanna sing you a song, I wanna lift up my voice 
 As I raise my hands, Lord I make my choice 
 That from this moment on until the end of my days 
 I want to offer up my life as a sacrifice of praise, 
 As a sacrifice of praise 
 God of Glory, God of Might 
 King of Heaven, Lord of Light 
 Though my ways are less than wise, 
 I come to praise You 
 Jesus, Master, Savior, Friend 
 Your mercy seems to have no end 
 And though all I have to bring is sin 
 I come to praise You 
 And my righteousness, is as filthy rags 
 But You exchange them for the good things that You have (Chorus) 
 I want to show You just how much I love You 
 I want to love You with my life (4x) (Chorus 2x)

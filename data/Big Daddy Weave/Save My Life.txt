Deep inside 
 Down in the darkest part of my heart 
 Where would I'm ashamed of tries to hide 
 And tell me that things are fine 
 Just the way they are 
 I'm so afraid 
 Of anyone finding out about these chains 
 I'm starting to believe there's no way 
 The pieces of me I hate 
 Are ever gonna change 
 Oh how I need You see 
 Here's my broken heart I lift it up 
 It's empty of 
 The foolish pride 
 I no longer try to hide 
 Please hear my desperate plea 
 Come and rescue me 
 'Cause I realize tonight 
 I need You to save my life 
 All my life 
 I've been running from the light of Your truth 
 Holding back a part of me I should've given You 
 Because I never knew 
 There was freedom just outside 
 So I can't stand living with these lies 
 I don't want there to ever be one more day 
 When I can't see just how desperately 
 I'm in need of You 
 How I need you see 
 Here's my broken heart I lift it up 
 It's empty of the foolish pride 
 I no longer try to hide 
 Please hear my desperate plea 
 Come and rescue me 
 'Cause I realize tonight 
 I need You to save my life 
 I need You to save my life 
 I need You to save my life

Locked inside this cell of flesh 
 I sat awaiting an eminent death 
 The fruitful labor of my sin 
 Had brought me to what I knew would be my end 
 Well I had a debt I couldn't pay 
 You paid a debt you didn't owe 
 You gave your life for me that day 
 So freedom I could know 
 Set me free 
 From the chains that bound me to my sin 
 Set me free 
 From this life that I've been livin' 
 Set me free 
 There has never been a time 
 When your mercy did not find me. 
 Tangled up in all my sin 
 And then so faithfully unwind me. 
 But just before I slipped away 
 You heard me when I called your name 
 There'll never be a day 
 When you won't come and 
 Set me free 
 From the chains that bound me to my sin 
 Set me free 
 From this life that I've been livin' 
 Set me free 
 You are the author and the finisher of the faith in me 
 I know that I trust in you to come and 
 Set me free 
 From the chains that bound me to my sin 
 Set me free 
 From this life that I've been livin' 
 Set me free 
 Come and set me free 
 Won't you set me free 
 Come and set me free

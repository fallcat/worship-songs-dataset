I've seen the flash of lightning 
 I've heard the rolling thunder 
 I've felt the crashing of the waves 
 And though I've known Your presence 
 And been filled with wonder 
 Still there are many things that pull me away 
 Don't let me go, ooh hold me close because 
 I don't want to hurt You anymore 
 I don't want to waste another day 
 'Cause it breaks Your heart, it breaks Your heart 
 When I keep walking away 
 You know what it means to sacrifice 
 But You tell me that it's better to obey 
 You've giving me a thousand brand new starts 
 Jesus, give me what it takes to stay 
 Give me what it takes to stay 
 I've felt Your hand of mercy through my darkest failures 
 And on the other side You've covered me with grace 
 And like a child lost and afraid, You come and find this runaway 
 And in Your loving arms You bring me home again 
 What's it gonna take to make me stay 
 I don't want to hurt You anymore 
 I don't want to waste another day 
 'Cause it breaks Your heart, it breaks Your heart 
 When I keep walking away 
 You know what it means to sacrifice 
 But You tell me that it's better to obey 
 You've giving me a thousand brand new starts 
 Jesus, give me what it takes to stay 
 Give me what it takes to stay 
 Give me what it takes to stay, oh 
 Break my heart with what breaks Yours 
 Until You're all I'm living for 
 Show me what it means 
 Not just to believe but to remain 
 I don't want to hurt You anymore 
 I don't want to waste another day 
 'Cause it breaks Your heart, it breaks Your heart 
 When I keep walking away 
 You know what it means to sacrifice 
 But You tell me that it's better to obey 
 You've giving me a thousand brand new starts 
 Jesus, give me what it takes to stay 
 Give me what it takes to stay 
 Give me what it takes to stay 
 I mean what it takes to stay 
 Let me stay 
 Let me stay, I want to stay

He's coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms will bow down 
 And every chain will break, as broken hearts declare His praise 
 Who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah 
 He's roaring with power and fighting our battles 
 And every knee will bow before You 
 Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain 
 For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains 
 And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Oh every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 So open up the gates, make way before the King of kings 
 Our God who calls the saved is here to set the captives free 
 Who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah 
 He's roaring with power and fighting our battles 
 And every knee will bow before You 
 Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain 
 For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains 
 And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Oh every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Oh who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Oh who can stop the Lord Almighty? 
 Who can stop the Lord? 
 Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah 
 He's roaring with power and fighting our battles 
 And every knee will bow before You 
 Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain 
 For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains 
 And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Oh every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb 
 Every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb

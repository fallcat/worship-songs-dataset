Yours will be the only name that matters to me 
 The only one whose favor I seek 
 The only name that matters to me 
 Yours will be 
 The friendship and affection I need 
 To feel my Father smiling on me 
 The only name that matters to me 
 And Yours is the name the name that has saved me 
 Mercy and grace, the power that forgave me 
 And Your love is all I've ever needed 
 Yours will be the only name that matters to me 
 The only one whose favor I seek 
 The only name that matters to me 
 And Yours is the name the name that has saved me 
 Mercy and grace, the power that forgave me 
 And Your love is all I've ever needed 
 When I wake up in the Land of Glory 
 With the saints I will tell my story 
 There will be one name that I proclaim 
 When I wake up in the Land of Glory 
 With the saints I will tell my story 
 There will be one name that I proclaim 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, just that name 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, just that name 
 When I wake up in the Land of Glory 
 With the saints I will tell my story 
 There will be one name that I proclaim 
 When I wake up in the Land of Glory 
 With the saints I will tell my story 
 There will be one name that I proclaim 
 La la la la la la, la la la la la la... 
 When I wake up in the Land of Glory 
 With the saints I will tell my story 
 There will be one name that I proclaim

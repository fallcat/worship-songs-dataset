Lookin' around at the world and her treasure 
 I know I should know better but I just wanna have it all right now 
 Lookin' to take, I'm taken before, I know it I'm gainin' 
 All that the world has to offer but losin' my soul somehow 
 Now I've heard stories of fame and glory 
 And all that they can bring me 
 But Heaven sings of the deeper things like 
 A humble heart diligently seeking 
 You are the only and You are the only one for me 
 For all my days 
 You are the only, You are the only one for me 
 Come and make me Yours forever 
 I heard You say that the thing about passion is where all the action is 
 Your heart ain't trailin' far behind 
 I'm makin' a list and lookin' at what I missin' 
 And at where I'm spendin' my time 
 Am I missin' the one thing that I wanna find? 
 But wise men prize what the fools call lies 
 And the carnal call no fun 
 But I'm no fool to be cravin' You 
 To be wantin' to be with the only one 
 You are the only and You are the only one for me 
 For all my days, yeah 
 You are the only and You are the only one for me 
 Come and make me Yours forever 
 Gonna step out into the light of day 
 No more hidin' in the darkness that holds me back 
 You can find me here on the narrow way 
 And when they come askin', I'll just tell them that 
 You are the only, You are the only one for me 
 For all my days, yeah 
 You are the only, You are the only one for me 
 Come and make me Yours forever 
 You are the only, You are the only one for me 
 For all my days, yeah 
 You are the only, You are the only one for me 
 Come and make me Yours forever 
 Come and make me Yours forever 
 Come and make me Yours forever

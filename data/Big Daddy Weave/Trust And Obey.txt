When we walk with the Lord 
 In the light of His word 
 What a glory He sheds on our way 
 While we do His good will 
 He abides with us still 
 And with all who will trust and obey 
 Trust and obey 
 For there's no other way 
 To be happy in Jesus 
 But to trust and obey 
 But we never can prove 
 The delights of His love 
 Until all on the altar we lay 
 For the favor He shows 
 For the joy He bestows 
 Are for them who will trust and obey 
 Trust and obey 
 For there's no other way 
 To be happy in Jesus 
 But to trust and obey 
 Lord, I love You 
 Please help me to trust and obey 
 Lord, I love You 
 Please help me to trust and obey 
 Then in fellowship sweet 
 We will sit at His feet 
 Or we'll walk by His side in the way 
 What He says we will do 
 Where He sends we will go 
 Never fear, only trust and obey 
 Trust and obey 
 For there's no other way 
 To be happy in Jesus 
 But to trust and obey 
 Trust and obey 
 For there's no other way 
 To be happy in Jesus 
 But to trust and obey 
 Lord, I love You 
 Please help me to trust and obey 
 Lord, I love You 
 Please help me to trust and obey 
 Lord, I love You 
 Please help me to trust and obey

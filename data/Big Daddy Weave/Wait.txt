If in your sickness you are desperate to recover 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now 
 When you're a seeker who is longing to discover 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now 'cause 
 They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength 
 They will mount up on wings, they will walk and not faint 
 Seasons of this life change but God's faithfulness remains 
 They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength 
 When you keep asking but the answer still eludes you 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now 
 When the anger burns and threatens to consume you 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute now 'cause 
 They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength 
 They will mount up on wings, they will walk and not faint 
 Seasons of this life change but God's faithfulness remains 
 They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength 
 So wait, wait, just wait, wait 
 When you've been running 
 Love comes sneaking up behind you 
 Hey, wait a minute now 
 They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength 
 They will mount up on wings, they will walk and not faint 
 Seasons of this life change but God's faithfulness remains 
 They who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength 
 Shall renew their strength, so hurry up and wait

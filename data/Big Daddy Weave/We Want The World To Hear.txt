Eternal King, we bless Your Name 
 For You were and You are, forever You will be 
 Praised in this place 
 And Lord our hearts are yielded 
 We give them only to You God 
 There is none righteous 
 There is none worthy 
 There is none Holy but You the King 
 I will live my life to sing of Your wonder 
 To shout of Your glory so creation will hear God 
 We want the world to hear 
 Oh sovereign King this heart is free 
 From the death that I was born into 
 You put Your Grace out on display 
 And in response I can help sing Your praise God 
 Hallelujah we sing 
 Hallelujah we cry 
 Hallelujah we're living for Your Name, Jesus 
 Hallelujah we sing 
 Hallelujah we cry 
 Hallelujah we're living for You

I used to think that I was never good enough to cut it 
 I bought the lines that they were selling time after time 
 But when You opened up my mind and I refused to shut it 
 You brought me to a place where I could leave it all behind 
 Good-bye to my old life 
 I don't listen to those lies anymore 
 You've given me new life 
 Loving You is what I was made for 
 It took a while for me to see but when I finally saw it 
 I knew I had to leave my sordid past in the past 
 I couldn't get there on my own it was Your grace that taught it 
 My sin is covered by Your blood and I'm not looking back 
 Good-bye to my old life 
 I don't listen to those lies anymore 
 You've given me new life 
 Loving You is what I was made for (2x) 
 You saw right through me, yeah 
 Your kindness drew me, yeah 
 Your mercy knew me, yeah 
 You love came to me 
 Good-bye to my old life 
 I don't listen to those lies anymore 
 You've given me new life 
 Loving You is what I was made for (2x)

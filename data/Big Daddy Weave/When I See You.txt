Look at You in all of Your splendor arrayed 
 Words can't describe just how beautiful You are 
 Look at You and all Your magnificent ways 
 I can't comprehend just how infinite You are 
 When I see You, everything is lovely 
 When I see You, my whole world seems to change 
 When I see You, there's no way I'll ever be the same 
 When I see You, when I see You 
 Look at You, You're such a compassionate friend 
 The world's yet to see one as faithful as You are 
 Look at Your mercy and grace without end 
 Your kindness is leading me right back to Your heart 
 When I see You, everything is lovely 
 When I see You, my whole world seems to change 
 When I see You, there's no way I'll ever be the same 
 Oh, when I see glorious, wonderful, Almighty King 
 You reign in power and we bow before You now 
 Author of majesty, the whole earth will sing of who You are 
 Oh, and how great You are 
 Look at me tremble I'm so out of place 
 But You draw me close 
 Because that's just how You are 
 When I see You, everything is lovely 
 When I see You, my whole world seems to change 
 When I see You, there's no way I'll ever be the same 
 When I see You 
 When I see You, everything is lovely 
 When I see You, my whole world seems to change 
 When I see You, there's no way I'll ever be the same 
 I will never be the same, never be the same 
 When I see You, when I see You 
 When I see You, when I see You 
 When I see You, when I see You 
 When I see You, when I see You 
 When I see You

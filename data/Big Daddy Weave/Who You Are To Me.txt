You see yourself in the mirror of the temporary 
 And you think that your worth is something to be achieved 
 When your value really is a question of identity 
 Has it ever crossed your mind who you are to Me? 
 You're the precious child that I created 
 (Who you are to Me) 
 I bought with a price, you're My beloved 
 (Who you are to Me) 
 Open your eyes and I'll show you 
 How to see what I see 
 If you would just believe that you are 
 Who you are to Me 
 Defusing the bomb instilled within the minds of children 
 You're the life inside a body that refuses to believe 
 A revelation of My love is waiting just to be received 
 Won't you let Me show you who you are to Me? 
 You're the precious child that I created 
 (Who you are to Me) 
 I bought with a price, you're My beloved 
 (Who you are to Me) 
 Open your eyes and I'll show you 
 How to see what I see 
 If you would just believe that you are 
 Who you are to Me 
 And I love you so much that I crossed the great divide 
 And I love you so much that I sent My only Son to die 
 And there's no one who could ever take your place in My heart 
 I want you to know that I love you right where you are 
 You're the precious child that I created 
 (Who you are to Me) 
 I bought with a price, you're My beloved 
 (Who you are to Me) 
 Open your eyes and I'll show you 
 How to see what I see 
 If you would just believe that you are 
 Who you are to Me 
 Who you are to Me 
 Who you are to Me 
 Who you are to Me

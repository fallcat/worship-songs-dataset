Walking down the road this life is on 
 The narrow path I try to stay 
 But I must confess I have a tendency to stray 
 Well, I'd love to call it a mistake 
 A momentary lapse of faith 
 But the truth is sometimes I feel that I'm being dragged away 
 By the other side that people never see 
 A war is on between the good and bad inside of me. 
 So why do I do all the things that I do 
 When I want to do what is right? 
 Change this wicked heart of mine 
 Let me walk with you in the new life. Yeah 
 So what will ever put an end 
 To this recurring bout with sin 
 It seems I'm always at a loss for a way to win 
 But, what I really need to do 
 Is to confront it with the truth 
 And let your words of life sink in and make my mind brand new 
 A transformation that happens over time 
 Is the product of a renewed mind 
 Why do I do all the things that I do 
 When I want to do what is right? 
 Change this wicked heart of mine 
 Let me walk with you in the new life. 
 Create in me a clean heart 
 Place your spirit deep inside 
 Capture every thought 
 'Til there's no place left to hide 
 No place to hide from you 
 So why do I do all the things that I do 
 When I want to do what is right? 
 Change this wicked heart of mine 
 Let me walk with you in the new life. 
 Why do I do all the things that I do 
 When I want to do what is right? 
 Change my heart, renew my mind 
 Let me walk with you in the new life.

Would we hear the sound 
 Of breathing in the dark 
 Where would be life's spark 
 Without You 
 Would the birds ever sing 
 Would the wind move through the trees 
 Could I touch the grass so green 
 Under this big sky so blue 
 Without You 
 And the sun doesn't shine 
 And my world stops spinnin' round 
 Without You 
 Tell me where else could I ever find 
 The peace that floods this heart of mine 
 Without You 
 Who could fill the emptiness inside 
 Who would ease the pain in my broken heart 
 Who would come in and abide 
 Promise never to depart 
 Without You 
 I can't live without You 
 I don't want to try to 
 Live one more moment without You

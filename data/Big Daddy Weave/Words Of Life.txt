On this hallowed ground 
 In this holy moment 
 Lord I am amazed standing in Your presence 
 Let my heart be still 
 And everything surrounding 
 Listen to the voice that was all creations founding 
 Words of Life 
 (Speak to me) 
 Words of Life 
 (Jesus speak) 
 Words of life to me 
 Down here on my knees 
 I'm broken and I'm bleeding 
 Longing to be free 
 So desperately I'm needing 
 You to look my way 
 And see this poor heart beating 
 You have but to say 
 One word will be my healing 
 Speak Your words of life to me 
 Say the words that set me free 
 I long to hear You, long to feel 
 You drawing near, I'm drawing near to You

I saw three AM come and go again 
 Another sleepless night, thanks to living my own way 
 All my great ideas, I've regretted most of them 
 But that was back long before the day 
 When I saw a flash of light and I heard the sound 
 Of a voice like thunder shake the ground 
 It was the first time I remember ever feeling my heartbeat 
 And the arms that gripped me felt like grace 
 And I realized in their embrace 
 To be held so tight 
 I've never felt so free 
 Also know as the day that you found me 
 My whole life has changed ever since the day You came 
 The way I see, the things I want, it's everything 
 Some may call it strange, I don't care what people say 
 I knew You were the only way 
 I've never known a love like this 
 You've captured my heart and You brought the sweetest 
 Peace to my life, brought me into the light 
 Now I'm all Yours, Jesus, draw me into You 
 I don't think that I could ever be the same 
 Who would want to be anyway

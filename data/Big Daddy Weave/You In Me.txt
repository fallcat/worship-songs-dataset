Up tight, down right 
 Wound up like a spring 
 Funny how I worry 'bout what just don't mean a thing 
 But then that's when 
 You speak Your truth to me 
 You say things aren't what they seem 
 This life's not what it seems 
 And it changes 
 I'm in less of a hurry 
 I'm less likely to worry 
 When in my heart I receive 
 Thoughts of my eternal destiny 
 I've given up frustration 
 Trust You without hesitation 
 But my mind just can't conceive 
 That it must be the You in me Lord 
 Yea, Yea 
 I tried till I cried 
 To bring about some change 
 But in spite of all the work 
 My efforts were in vain 
 I guess for this mess 
 That I'm the on to blame 
 Because when I'm trusting You, God 
 My life's is not the same 
 I'm different now 
 I'm in less of a hurry 
 I'm less likely to worry 
 When in my heart I receive 
 Thoughts of my eternal destiny 
 I've given up frustration 
 Trust You without hesitation 
 But my mind just can't conceive 
 That it must be the You in me Lord 
 No matter what my present situation 
 I need to give it all to You 
 Yea, Yea 
 I'm in less of a hurry 
 I'm less likely to worry 
 When in my heart I receive 
 Thoughts of my eternal destiny 
 I've given up frustration 
 Trust You without hesitation 
 But my mind just can't conceive 
 That it must be the You in me, Yeah 
 You in me, God 
 You in me, Lord 
 It's the You in Me

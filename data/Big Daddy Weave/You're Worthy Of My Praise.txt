 And I will praise You with all of my strength 
 And I will seek You all of my days 
 And I will follow all of Your ways 
 And I will give You all my worship 
 And I will give You all of my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise

 Oh, and I will serve You, I'll give You everything 
 I will lift up my eyes to Your throne 
 Oh and I will trust You, I will trust You alone 
 And I will give You all my worship 
 And I will give You all of my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise 
 And I will give You all my worship 
 And I will give You all of my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise

 I will give You all my praise 
 I will worship, I will bow down 
 I will give You all my praise 
 I will worship, I will bow down 
 I will give You all my praise 
 I will worship, I will bow down 
 I will give You all my praise 
 And I will give You all my worship 
 And I will give You all of my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise 
 And I will give You all my worship 
 And I will give You all of my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise 
 You're worthy of my praise 
 You're worthy of my praise

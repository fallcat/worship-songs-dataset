Help me live a life 
 Of love that pleases 
 My one desire 
 Is to see You lifted 
 To see You lifted 
 To see You lifted 
 Burn me up, Burn me up 
 Until all that's seen 
 All that's seen is You 
 Jesus You're all 
 I've ever needed 
 Your joy will be 
 The strength I live by 
 The strength I live by 
 The strength I live by 
 Lead me on to the place 
 Where I'll see You face to face 
 Where Your glory is revealed 
 Lead me on 
 Lead me on

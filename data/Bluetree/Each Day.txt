Each day, in the morning sun I see You 
 And my heart cries out with praise, for You 
 King of this heart 
 Each time, in the sun or rain I feel You 
 And my spirit cries with praise for You 
 Lord of this life 
 For You never leave me alone 
 Even when storms cloud my way 
 And I can't see breaking day 
 You never leave me alone 
 For You'll get the praise Your due 
 For even the rocks cry out to You 
 And when it's said and done 
 You never leave me alone 
 Each night, in the evening moon I see You 
 Your beauty shines for all to see 
 King of glory 
 Neither death nor life, the darkness 
 Or even the light can separate 
 Me from Your love 
 For You never leave me alone 
 Even when storms cloud my way 
 And I can't see breaking day 
 You never leave me alone 
 For You'll get the praise Your due 
 For even the rocks cry out to You 
 And when it's said and done 
 You never leave me alone

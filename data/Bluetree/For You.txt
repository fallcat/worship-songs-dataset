No greater love have You ever shown to me 
 Then send Your son, to be nailed to a tree 
 With lifted hands and a heart that longs to say 
 Thank You, Thank You 
 This is for You 
 Jesus for You 
 We will bow down 
 We will worship You Lord 
 There has never been 
 There will never be 
 There is no-one like You God 
 In freedom here 
 And with boldness we draw near 
 To worship You and declare that You are God 
 May you be seen as what you truly are 
 Holy, Holy

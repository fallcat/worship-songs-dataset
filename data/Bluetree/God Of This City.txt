You're the God of this city, 
 You're the King of these people, 
 You're the Lord of this nation, 
 You Are. 
 You're the Light of this darkness, 
 You're the Hope to the hopeless, 
 You're the Peace to the restless, 
 You Are. 
 For there is no one like our God. 
 There is no one like you, God. 
 Greater things have yet to come, 
 And greater things are still to be done, in this city. 
 Greater things are yet to come, 
 And greater things are still to be done here. 
 You're the Lord of Creation, 
 The Creator of all things, 
 You're the King above all Kings, 
 You Are. 
 You're the Strength in our weakness, 
 You're the Love to the broken, 
 You're the Joy in the sadness 
 You Are. 
 For there is no one like our God. 
 There is no one like you, God. 
 Greater things have yet to come, 
 And greater things are still to be done, in this city. 
 Where glory shines from hearts alive, 
 With praise for you and love for you, in this city.

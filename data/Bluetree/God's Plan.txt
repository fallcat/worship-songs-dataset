I am part of Your great plan 
 And my life is in Your hands 
 My purpose found in You 
 All Your ways are true 
 I was made to bring You pleasure 
 Living day by day in favour 
 I receive by faith Your goodness 
 I was made to bring You joy 
 How great is the love of God? 
 How great is the love of God? 
 How great is Yourr love oh God? 
 Surely Your goodness and Your mercy 
 Surround me day-by-day

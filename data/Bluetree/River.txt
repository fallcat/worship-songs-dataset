There's a river of love that's here 
 There's a river of grace that's here 
 You're invited to come and swim within 
 Fresh winds are blowing 
 Fresh winds are coming here 
 The tide is rising 
 And The Spirit is moving 
 He's moving 
 Death to the past its gone 
 Here's to a new beginning 
 Our Gods not finished yet with us 
 Death to the past it's gone 
 Here's to a new beginning 
 Your God's not finished yet with you

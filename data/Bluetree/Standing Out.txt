Let my life be a light shining out for all to see 
 Standing for you standing for you 
 May our days be a storm raining life on dry ground 
 Standing for you standing for you. 
 How amazing is your name in all the earth 
 And how majestic are your ways 
 How gracious that you let me stand for you 
 In all I do I'm standing out for you. (chorus) 
 May my life never fail to reflect the wonders of your name 
 Standing for you standing for you 
 May life be a song raining life on dry ground 
 Standing for you standing for you.

Who has held the waters in his hand? 
 Or weighed in scales each grain of sand? 
 Who has set the sun into its place? 
 Or flung the stars wide into space? 
 We see its only You 
 We see its only You 
 We has called the day to follow night? 
 Or gave birds the beauty of flight? 
 Who has made the leaves to turn to green? 
 Or painted flowers for all to be seen? 
 And you're always there for me 
 Your grace has lifted me 
 It's the beauty of Your majesty 
 I love You king of kings 
 I thank You Lord of Lords

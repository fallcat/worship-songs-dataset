Your love, Your everlasting love 
 Transforms me 
 It brings me to my knees again (x2) 
 And worship on my knees again 
 Great is Your name (x3) 
 In all of the earth 
 Your grace, your unending grace 
 It lifts me 
 It brings me to my knees again (x2) 
 And worship on my knees again 
 Your blood, your unfeeling blood 
 It saves me 
 It brings me to my knees again (x2) 
 And worship on my knees again 
 Great is Your name (x3) 
 In all of the earth

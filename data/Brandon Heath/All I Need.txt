Somewhere on some distant shore 
 A boy rises up with the dawn 
 His bed is a mat on the floor 
 He kneels in the dirt with a song 
 Gives thanks to his God up above 
 With his simple offering of love 
 He has nothing on Earth to his name 
 But with all of his heart, he starts to sing 
 All I need, all I need, all I need is You, Lord 
 I've got everything 
 All I need, all I need, all I need is You, Lord 
 I've got everything 
 A woman steps out for some air 
 And catches the still setting sun 
 Remembers when he was still there 
 They married when she was still young 
 And when she looks back on their years 
 There's sorrow and joy in her tears 
 No one here on earth bears her name 
 Still she lifts up her head and starts to sing 
 All I need, all I need, all I need is You, Lord 
 I've got everything 
 All I need, all I need, all I need is You, Lord 
 I've got everything 
 So come wrap me up in Your love 
 You are forever enough 
 I've got all I need, all I need, all I need in You, Lord 
 You are all I'll ever need 
 Bread alone cannot sustain us 
 The earth below cannot contain us 
 We are made whole in the One who made us 
 So sing, sing, sing it out 
 You are everything 
 You are all I'll ever need 
 I've got everything 
 God, You're all I'll ever need

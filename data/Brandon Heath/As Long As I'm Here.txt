Some day I'll pass through the great sky above 
 And the first thing I'll ask is how well did I love 
 Did I leave the world any better than it was before? 
 Of all the things I've done, could I have done any more? 
 'Cause it took me a while just to find my feet 
 And to learn how to stand on my own 
 But You gave me the heart and the time I would need 
 To find You and make it back home where I belong 
 Some day I'll go to the great, wide beyond 
 Where Moses and Mary and Jacob and my loved ones have gone 
 But I will rejoice in today and the journey I'm on 
 And I'll keep on praying and pressing on until dawn 
 'Cause it took me a while just to find my feet 
 And to learn how to stand on my own 
 But You gave me the heart and the time I would need 
 To find You and make it back home where I belong 
 Only to see a glimpse of Your face 
 To peek in to Heaven, time and space 
 Oh, to feel my own frailty and tremble in fear 
 To know You are with me as long as I'm here 
 Oh, as long as I'm here 
 Some day I'll pass through the great sky above 
 And the first thing I'll ask is how well did I love

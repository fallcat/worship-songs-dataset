Does it ever catch your eye 
 Beauty divine 
 In an old man's tears 
 A little girl's smile 
 If it feels like a song 
 One that belongs 
 To you 
 Stop making sense 
 Your weakest defense 
 Just quiet your mind 
 Let the world unwind 
 See we're not alone 
 He makes Himself known 
 In time 
 His own time 
 So breathe 
 Life will surprise you 
 Just Be 
 It's what the world denies you 
 You see 
 The truth is all around you 
 Believe 
 We're not alone 
 He makes Himself known 
 In time, His own time 
 Does it ever catch your eye

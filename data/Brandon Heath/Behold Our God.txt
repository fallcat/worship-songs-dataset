He is the glory of the stars 
 He is the lover of the human heart 
 The universe is in His hands 
 Next to Him none will stand 
 Behold our God 
 In all His Majesty 
 Behold our God 
 Author of mystery 
 Behold our God 
 He is our Father and our Friend 
 Faithful to the end 
 Behold Him 
 His love is wider than the sea 
 Goes on forever through eternity 
 Washed on His shore, we're grains of sand 
 Next to Him none will stand 
 Behold our God 
 In all His Majesty 
 Behold our God 
 Author of mystery 
 Behold our God 
 He is our Father and our Friend 
 He's faithful to the end 
 Behold our King 
 Fall down in wonder 
 And behold our King 
 There is no other 
 He is everything 
 He is the life and light of man 
 Beginning and the end 
 Glorious, glorious 
 Everything about You 
 Everything about You is 
 Glorious, glorious 
 Come and see all of His beauty 
 Behold, behold Him 
 Fall down in wonder 
 There is no other 
 Behold our God

I am not my family tree 
 These are different leaves, you know 
 There are miles and miles between 
 My roots and what I'm trying to grow 
 I am not the slave they sold 
 Nor am I royalty 
 I've worn them both, the finest coat 
 And rags that barely cover me 
 But there's mercy in the soil, mercy in the sun 
 Learning to forgive, what cannot be undone 
 And what was meant to harm can't harm you in the end 
 Stepped out on a limb I thought might break 
 But love said, it will only bend 
 It will only bend 
 I am not my past mistakes 
 Labelled by some place and time 
 Nor am I trophy case 
 Trying to maintain my shine 
 I have dreamed a thousand dreams 
 Watched a grain in famine, grow 
 I am not my family tree 
 I have branches of my own 
 But there's mercy in the soil, mercy in the sun 
 Learning to forgive, what cannot be undone 
 And what was meant to harm can't harm you in the end 
 Stepped out on a limb I thought might break 
 But Love said, it will only bend 
 It will only bend 
 Oh, does fate resign us to 
 Find shelter for our wounds 
 Beneath the battered roof of broken dreams? 
 Oh, but I will choose to stand 
 In the shadow of your hand 
 And see what grows when grace has sown the seed

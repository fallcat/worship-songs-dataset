I am not my family tree 
 These are different leaves you know 
 There are miles and miles between 
 My roots in what I'm trying to grow 
 I am not the slave they sold 
 Nor am I royalty 
 I've worn them both, the finest coat 
 And rags that barely cover me 
 But there's mercy in the soil 
 Mercy in the sun 
 Learning to forgive 
 What cannot be undone 
 And what was meant to harm 
 Can't harm you in the end 
 Stepped out on a limb I thought might break 
 But love said, it will only bend, it will only bend 
 I am not my past mistakes 
 Labeled by some place and time 
 Nor am I a trophy case 
 Trying to maintain my shine 
 I have dreamed a thousand dreams 
 Watched a grain in famine grow 
 I am not my family tree 
 I have branches of my own 
 But there's mercy in the soil 
 Mercy in the sun 
 Learning to forgive 
 What cannot be undone 
 And what was meant to harm 
 Can't harm you in the end 
 Stepped out on a limb I thought might break 
 But love said, it will only bend 
 Oh, does fate resign us to 
 Find shelter for our wounds 
 Beneath the battered roof 
 Of broken dreams? 
 Oh, but I will choose to stand 
 In the shadow of Your hand 
 And see what grows 
 When Grace has sown a seed 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 These are different leaves you know 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 But there's mercy in the soil 
 Mercy in the sun 
 Learning to forgive 
 What cannot be undone 
 And what was meant to harm 
 Can't harm you in the end 
 Stepped out on a limb I thought might break 
 But love said, it will only bend, it will only bend 
 It will only bend, oh 
 It will only bend, oh

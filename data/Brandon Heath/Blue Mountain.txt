Cool fog in the morning 
 Like cotton on the trees 
 Quiet enough to hear a song 
 In the humming of the bees 
 Floating out from the highway 
 Saying, come on up my way 
 Through the tall grass in the valley 
 Where the earth and Heaven meet 
 Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain 
 Above the clouds and busy crowds 
 It's where you wanna be 
 Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain 
 Where the time crawls and the water falls 
 Blue Mountain majesty 
 Send a postcard to your sweetheart 
 Take a picture by the sign 
 See all the way to seven states 
 And the coast if the weather's right 
 It's always right, it's paradise 
 It's like you've never seen 
 Take a nap under a hickory 
 And wake up in a dream 
 Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain 
 Above the clouds and busy crowds 
 You swear you'll never leave 
 Won't you come on up to Blue Mountain 
 Where the time crawls and the water falls 
 Blue Mountain majesty

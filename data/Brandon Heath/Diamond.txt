My father's father broke this ground 
 Daddy mined till we laid him down 
 Only God knows what they found beneath 
 Now here I stand in my own boots 
 Ax to grind and a point to prove 
 Tangled up in my own roots, it seems 
 I got treasure up in Heaven 
 I got dirt all over me 
 I have only scratched the surface 
 Of the man I'm meant to be 
 I got something down inside of me 
 That only You can see 
 Help me dig a little deeper now 
 And set that diamond free 
 Why do I do the things I do 
 All the things that I don't want to 
 Act like I don't fear You at all 
 Hard head and a heart of stone 
 Older now but I haven't grown 
 Any riches that I have to show are small 
 Set it free 
 Set it free 
 Set it free 
 Set it free 
 Come down with your old flashlight 
 Underground, black as night

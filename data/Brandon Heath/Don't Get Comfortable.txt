Comfortable, don't get comfortable. 
 I am gonna move this mountain 
 Then I'm gonna move you in. 
 Yesterday 
 This is not yesterday. 
 You were standing on my shoulder 
 Now you're standing on the edge. 
 You've been looking for a sign all this time. 
 I am gonna show you what I mean 
 I am gonna love like you've never seen 
 You are gonna live like you used to dream 
 This is your new song 
 So afraid 
 But you don't have to be afraid 
 Even if you make mistakes 
 You know that I'll remain 
 You been looking for a sign all this time. 
 If you seek you'll find me every time. 
 So I am gonna show you what I mean 
 I am gonna' love like you've never seen 
 You are gonna live like you used to dream 
 This is your new song 
 NA na na na na na na na nanaaah 
 NA na na na na na na na nanaaah 
 Can you feel the call of love? 
 Is it moving you to be a child of God of love? 
 Is it reaching you? 
 It's everywhere the call of love. 
 I just wanna to show you what I mean 
 I just wanna to love like you've never seen 
 Do you want to live like you used to dream? 
 Then I've got a song for you 
 'Cause I am gonna show you what I mean 
 I am gonna' love like you've never seen 
 You are gonna live like you used to dream 
 This is your new song 
 NA na na na na na na na nanaaah 
 You've got a new song 
 NA na na na na na na na nanaaah

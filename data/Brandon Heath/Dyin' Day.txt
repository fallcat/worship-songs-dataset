Blue Mountain Penitentiary 
 Been housing sin for centuries 
 I am just a number, not a name 
 And you wear a gun and hold the keys 
 But you've always been good to me 
 Only see the man and not the shame 
 And I haven't seen my wife in years 
 Last memory is her in tears 
 Wonder if she'll even come tonight 
 There's something that she doesn't know 
 She needs to hear before I go 
 Could you tell her I'm alright 
 Would you pray with me 
 Touch the hand of a sinner 
 Would you stay with me 
 And be my guest for dinner 
 Looks like this is my dyin' day 
 They tell me that's the only way 
 I'll ever see the other side again 
 But they don't know who's been in here 
 Every day the last three years 
 Yes, sir, I'm the one who let Him in 
 And He comes and sits down in my chair 
 Weeping, breathing this same air 
 And opens up His hands 
 Reminds me that He walked this mile 
 Suffered for a little while 
 And made me an innocent man 
 Would you pray with me 
 Touch the hand of a sinner 
 Would you stay with me 
 And be my guest for dinner 
 Would you pray with me 
 Touch the hand of a sinner 
 Would you stay with me 
 My last guest for dinner

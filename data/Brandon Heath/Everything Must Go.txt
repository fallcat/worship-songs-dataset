Saturday from 8 to 5 
 1120 East Valley Drive 
 Power tools and a few guitars 
 Atari and some vintage Matchbox cars 
 And a new bass boat 
 Everything must go 
 I ain't broke 
 And I ain't dying 
 I just felt like simplifying 
 Flat screen TV, recliner chair 
 Broken in real good from sitting there 
 You better bring some rope 
 'Cause everything must go 
 Finally got it figured out 
 What I can live with or without 
 Get rid of what's crowding up my soul 
 What's the cost of living free 
 What I own and what owns me 
 Make a little room for love to grow 
 And a stereo 
 Everything must be go 
 Bow and arrows, croquet set 
 Still in the box 
 It ain't been opened yet 
 Harley jacket, western shirts 
 I'll throw in an old juke box that still works 
 And some GI Joe's 
 Everything must go 
 'Cause the more I let it go 
 The less I feel the weight 
 Tell everyone that you know 
 Come sunshine, come rain 
 Toaster oven, Nordic Trac 
 Make me an offer 
 I don't want it back 
 You better bring some rope 
 Free Oreos 
 Everything must go

I wanna build four walls 
 Keep you safe inside 
 And catch you when you fall 
 Don't wanna see you cry 
 And when you walk down the street 
 Make you hold my hand 
 I wanna lift you off your feet 
 Be your Superman, SupermanI wanna take you for a ride 
 When you cannot sleep 
 Brush your hair to the side 
 Kiss you on your cheek 
 I wanna stay up all night 
 Making sure you breathe 
 Oh my God, what a gift 
 He has given me 
 Yeah, I brought you into this world 
 And I'm sorry it's a little bit crazy 
 But I tell you there is so much good 
 Though the future looks a little bit hazy 
 But see God me and Him have a promise 
 And He'll give us everything that we need 
 So have faith, hope and love 
 Faith, hope, love, repeat 
 I wanna show you the world 
 Climb the mountaintops 
 Watch you dance in the rain 
 I hope it never stops 
 Whatever tomorrow brings 
 I hope it brings you joy 
 And when it's all too much 
 I'll hold you in my arms 
 But there will be days when you lose your faith 
 There will be nights when you give up hope 
 Disappointment and pain and you'll flirt with the shame 
 So you'll call me from the end of your rope 
 And I'll give you whatever I have 
 Though there's only one thing you'll need 
 And that's love, I'll give you my love 
 My love, I'll give you my love

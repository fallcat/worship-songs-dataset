I've been walking around with my heart in my hand 
 I might ask you if you could ever understand 
 I can't take another break in my heart 
 So let me show you darling where to start 
 You think you know how to love me 
 But I think you might go and tear me apart 
 You think you know how to show me 
 But I could use a few less breaks in my heart 
 If there ever was a big mistake I made 
 I'm still broke from all the prices that I paid 
 I can't bring myself to linger in the past 
 I need something that I know is gonna last 
 You think you know how to love me 
 But I think you might go and tear me apart 
 You think you know how to show me 
 But I could use a few less breaks in my heart

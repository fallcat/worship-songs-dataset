It's an uphill climb 
 But it's all you know 
 So you spin your wheels 
 And dig your heels and down you go 
 So predictable 
 But it's not your fault 
 How can you expect to do your best 
 When you're scared to fall 
 Cause the pain is real 
 But you will survive 
 That's how you know you're alive 
 'Cause it's Okay Now, Hey Now 
 You can let go 
 That's when you 
 Find out, Find out 
 Everybody knows 
 That there just 
 Ain't no, Ain't no 
 Easier way out 
 I know it might not look that way 
 But You're gonna live to fight another day 
 There's a place I know 
 Outside of town 
 Let's get out of here 
 Where all our fears don't hang around 
 Here's another chance 
 Take it while you can 
 Cause it sure wont last 
 Moves so fast 
 And it's gone again 
 You wonder what you are made 
 I'm telling you now 
 You're gonna make somehow 
 What are you so afraid of

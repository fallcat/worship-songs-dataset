I just saw the girl of my dreams 
 I wonder if she noticed me 
 I don't know her name yet but I know her friend 
 I'll ask if she's taken or if I could send her some flowers 
 I just met the girl of dreams 
 It's funny it turns out that she 
 Lives just down the street, we could go for a walk 
 Or sit on her porch drinking coffee and talking for hours 
 Falling in love is a beautiful thing 
 Like every morning's the first day of spring 
 God be must smiling down over me 
 I'm in love with the girl of my dreams 
 So I married the girl of my dreams 
 In a chapel in Tennessee 
 She looked like a princess in her wedding dress 
 I looked like a penguin and I must confess I was nervous 
 Now I live with girl of my dreams 
 It's different than I thought it'd be 
 She steals all my closets and tells me I snore 
 It's ice cream and Netflix and I love her more every minute 
 Brown hair, blueish-green eyes 
 She's southern as apple pie 
 In the summer (summer) 
 I love her 
 I'll grow old with the girl of my dreams 
 Holidays with our big family 
 Thousands of memories will hang on the wall 
 Heartaches and laughter, yeah, I'll take it all and be thankful (thankful) 
 Falling in love is a beautiful thing 
 You give up yourself but you gain everything 
 She's more than a lover, she's my best friend 
 I'll be her companion until the end 
 God must be up there smiling on me 
 'Cause I'm walking on clouds and moonbeams 
 I'm in love with the girl of my dreams

Looked down from a broken sky 
 Traced out by the city lights 
 My world from a mile high 
 Best seat in the house tonight 
 Touched down on the cold black tar 
 Hold on for the sudden stop 
 Breathe in the familiar shock 
 Of confusion 
 And chaos 
 All those people goin' somewhere 
 Why have I never cared? 
 Give me Your eyes for just one second 
 Give me Your eyes so I can see 
 Everything that I keep missing 
 Give me Your love for humanity 
 Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted 
 The ones that are far beyond my reach 
 Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten 
 Give me Your eyes so I can see 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Step out on a busy street 
 See a girl and our eyes meet 
 Does her best to smile at me 
 To hide what's underneath 
 There's a man just to her right 
 Black suit and a bright red tie 
 Too ashamed to tell his wife 
 He's out of work, he's buyin' time 
 All those people goin' somewhere 
 Why have I never cared? 
 Give me Your eyes for just one second 
 Give me Your eyes so I can see 
 Everything that I keep missing 
 Give me Your love for humanity 
 Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted 
 The ones that are far beyond my reach 
 Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten 
 Give me Your eyes so I can see 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I've been there a million times 
 A couple of million eyes 
 Just move and pass me by 
 I swear I never thought that I was wrong 
 Well I want a second glance 
 So give me a second chance 
 To see the way You've seen the people all along 
 Give me Your eyes for just one second 
 Give me Your eyes so I can see 
 Everything that I keep missing 
 Give me Your love for humanity 
 Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted 
 The ones that are far beyond my reach 
 Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten 
 Give me Your eyes so I can see 
 Give me Your Eyes (Give me Your eyes for just one second) 
 Lord, give me Your eyes (Give me Your eyes so I can see) 
 Everything (Everything that I keep missing) 
 That I keep missing 
 Give me Your heart (Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted) 
 For the broken hearted (The ones that are far beyond my reach) 
 Give me Your heart (Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten) 
 Lord, give me Your eyes (Give me Your eyes so I can see) 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah

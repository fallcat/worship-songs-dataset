Hang it up like a coat 
 Tear it up like a note 
 Let the pieces fall to the ground 
 Like falling snow 
 Go for a walk outside 
 Watch as the red bird flies 
 He needs lifting 
 And we need lifting, too 
 If we're gonna pray about it 
 There's no use in worrying 
 If we're gonna worry about it 
 Why are we praying 
 Just leave it in the hands of the Father 
 Leave it in the hands of the Healer 
 Leave it in the hands of Jesus 
 And walk away 
 Walk away 
 Take all your doubt and fear 
 Whisper it in His ear 
 Drop it in the mailbox 
 Raise the flag and let it go 
 We're laying 'em down to never carry again 
 We're laying 'em down, the burdens, burdens 
 Laying 'em down to never worry again 
 Laying 'em down, let 'em fly on the wind

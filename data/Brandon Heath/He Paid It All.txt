My Lord 
 What shall I give Him today 
 He wants my heart 
 More than He asks for my wage 
 One day I'll die 
 But it won't be my last day 
 When I look in His eyes 
 I'll know that I did ok 
 My Lord 
 What shall I sing Him for now 
 A song full of praise 
 From a mouth full of doubt 
 I lift up my face 
 And I sing out loud 
 With all my mistakes 
 I still make Him proud 
 He paid it all for me 
 Carried that cross for you 
 On that rugged walk, He knew 
 What He had to do 
 Opened His arms up wide 
 Invited the world inside 
 One final breath 
 He conquered death 
 For me and for you 
 My Lord 
 Where would He want me to go 
 Just across town 
 Or a place where I don't know a soul 
 Just tell me where 
 And I'll hit the road 
 With no time to spare 
 And no heavy load

Oh, heavenly day 
 All the clouds blew away 
 Got no trouble today 
 With anyone 
 The smile on your face 
 I live only to see 
 It's enough for me, baby 
 It's enough for me 
 Oh, heavenly day 
 Heavenly day 
 Heavenly day 
 Tomorrow may rain 
 With sorrow 
 Here's a little time 
 We can borrow 
 Forget all our troubles 
 In these moments so few 
 Oh, we can right now the only thing 
 That all that we really have to do 
 Is have ourselves a heavenly day 
 Lay here and watch the trees sway 
 Oh, can't see no other way, no way, no way 
 Heavenly day, heavenly day, heavenly day 
 No one on my shoulders 
 Bringing me fears 
 Got no clouds up above me 
 Bringing me tears 
 Got nothing to tell you 
 I got nothing much to say 
 Only I'm glad to be here with you 
 On this heavenly, heavenly, heavenly, heavenly 
 Heavenly day 
 Oh, all the troubles gone away 
 Oh, for awhile anyway, for awhile anyway 
 Heavenly day, heavenly day, heavenly day 
 Heavenly day, heavenly day, oh, heavenly day

You've got the whole world on your shoulders 
 And it's more than you can bear 
 I hear you calling for some help 
 But is there anybody there? 
 Well I'm here to let you know 
 This was never meant for you 
 I know what you're going through 
 Come to me weary now 
 And I will lay you down 
 Throw all your cares aside 
 You will never be denied 
 Come set your burden free 
 You will be safe with me 
 Come to me weary now 
 I will lay you down 
 So don't you worry 'bout a thing 
 I'm gonna get you through the night 
 I know you're scared but it's gonna be all right 
 And if you wake before the light 
 Don't be afraid, just call my name 
 I'll hear you pray, I'm on my way, yeah, yeah 
 So come to me weary now 
 And I will lay you down 
 Throw all your cares aside 
 You will never be denied 
 Come set your burden free 
 You will be safe with me 
 Come to me weary now 
 I will lay you down 
 Everything's all right 'cause I am on your side 
 And if you need to you can hide in me 
 Cause all you need to know 
 I will never let you go 
 I'm the lover of your soul 
 So come to me weary now 
 And I will lay you down 
 Throw all your cares aside 
 You will never be denied 
 Come set your burden free 
 You will be safe with me 
 Come to me weary now 
 I will lay you down

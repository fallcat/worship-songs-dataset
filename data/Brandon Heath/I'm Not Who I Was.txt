I wish you could see me now 
 I wish I could show you how 
 I'm not who I was 
 I used to be mad at you 
 A little on the hurt side too 
 But I'm not who I was 
 I found my way around 
 To forgiving you some time ago 
 But I never got to tell you so... 
 I found us in a photograph 
 I saw me and I had to laugh 
 You know I'm not who I was 
 You were there, you were right above me 
 And I wondered if you ever loved me 
 Just for who I was 
 When the pain came back again 
 Like a bitter friend 
 It was all that I could do 
 To keep myself from blaming you 
 Thinkin' it's a funny thing 
 Figured out I could sing 
 Now I'm not who I was 
 Write about love and such 
 Maybe 'cause I want it so much 
 I'm not who I was 
 I was thinkin' maybe I 
 Should let you know 
 That I am not the same 
 That I never did forget your name 
 Hello... 
 Ooh Nah nah nah nah nah 
 And the thing I find most amazing 
 In amazing grace 
 Is the chance to give it out 
 Maybe that's what love is all about 
 I wish you could see me now 
 I wish I could show you how 
 I'm not who I was...

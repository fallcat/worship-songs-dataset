I opened to door to my room and I thought of you 
 Painting my walls to the shade of your favorite blue 
 Dancing with a song in your head used to bother me 
 Now all I have is a song for some company 
 In my bright imagination 
 Blamed my shaky shot at love on the wind 
 In the end guess all I want you to say 
 Is that you want me to stay 
 If you called my name I would turn around 
 I would run to you 
 Sacrifice my shame I would follow, 
 I would follow you 
 Yesterdays gone so it's on with the rest of me 
 Should open my dreams with a dose of reality 
 And take another look at the bend in my history 
 Hoping that maybe you'll come chasing after me 
 If you called my name I would turn around 
 I would run to you 
 Sacrifice my shame I would follow, 
 I would follow you 
 Should I pay my penance 
 Would my price be enough for you 
 If I've got nothing up my sleeve 
 Would you believe 
 That if you called my name I would turn around 
 I would run to you 
 Sacrifice my shame I would follow, 
 I would follow you

For as long as I remember 
 And as far as I can see 
 There are pilgrims in a valley 
 Lost and thirsty just like me 
 We seek shelter in each other 
 When the rocks begin to slide 
 We can't run from what is coming 
 Down the mountainside 
 When it all comes down 
 It all comes down 
 From the ground we were created 
 To the ground we will return 
 Every moment that we've borrowed 
 Every token that we've earned 
 It was His in the beginning 
 And it's His to take away 
 And we can't be sure 'bout nothing 
 But we'll surely know one day 
 When it all comes down 
 It all comes down 
 And this vapor of a life will vanish on the wind 
 Every road I've traveled on will come to an end 
 He'll come riding in and steal me up in a rush 
 Take my place in the light 
 Leave my bones in the dust 
 So I won't root myself too deeply 
 In this valley where we dwell 
 I won't tie myself to nothing 
 That tells my soul it isn't well 
 I will wait and I will wonder 
 Only time will tell 
 When it all comes down 
 It all comes down 
 And I will leave this vessel broken down on the shore 
 Any shadows down below won't haunt me anymore 
 Any shackles on my hands will turn to rust 
 Take my place in the light 
 Leave my bones in the dust

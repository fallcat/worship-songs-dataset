It's All right by Brandon Heath 
 Tiny boat on an angry sea, sails torn an tattered 
 How could Jesus be fast asleep, like it doesn't matter. 
 Soon as He opens His eyes, the storm just dies. 
 It's all right, everything will be okay 
 Just hold tight, I'll be with you the whole way 
 When you're weak, I'll be strong 
 Keep going, we're almost home, 
 It's all right, everything will be okay. 
 (Everything will be okay ? 2nd time) 
 Mother Mary's got a broken heart, from the word's they're saying 
 Her baby boy's being torn apart, by the world He's saving, 
 He says ?Mother, don't cry for me. You know where I'll be.? 
 No promise of an easy road, just a destination 
 Next time you forget your home, somebody's waiting 
 Soon as you open your eyes, you realize? 
 It's all right, everything will be okay 
 Just hold tight, I'll be with you the whole way 
 When you're weak, He'll be strong 
 Keep going, you're almost home, 
 When you're weak, He is strong 
 Keep going, you're almost home 
 It's all right, everything will be okay.

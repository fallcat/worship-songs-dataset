We're leaving you a message on your telephone 
 Everybody's wondering what you're doing home 
 Yeah, we're starting and you're missing the party 
 Can you hear it playing your favorite song? 
 Everybody's singing but something's wrong 
 'Cause you're missing 
 Hey, hey, are you listening? 
 It's no good to be alone 
 It's no good to be out there on your own 
 It's no good for you anymore than it is for me 
 It's no good, no good for you to be alone 
 Alone, alone, alone, alone, no good to be alone 
 It's been a little while, you've been outta the scene 
 Spending all your time chasing down a dream 
 Takes a lifetime 
 It's a short life 
 You know it doesn't matter how high you climb 
 If no one's there to share the ride 
 When you get there who's gonna be there? 
 It's no good to be alone 
 It's no good to be out there on your own 
 It's no good for you anymore than it is for me 
 It's no good, no good for you to be alone 
 Alone, alone, alone, alone, no good to be alone 
 Nobody's suppose to be an island 
 Stuck out in the middle of the ocean on your own 
 I'm not giving up until I find you 
 Give me an S.O.S., I'll bring you home 
 It's no good for you to be alone 
 Don't you know? 
 It's no good to be alone 
 It's no good to be out there on your own 
 It's no good for you anymore than it is for me 
 It's no good, no good for you to be alone 
 Alone, alone, alone, alone, no good to be alone 
 Alone, alone, alone, alone, no good to be alone

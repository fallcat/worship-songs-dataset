Ever get something in your head 
 It's nothing you've heard, or something you've read 
 Ever had a cut, but you never saw a blade 
 Brought to your knees, but you never prayed 
 Jesus in disguise 
 Jehovah passing by 
 The burden of a tear 
 Hanging in your eye 
 Jesus in disguise 
 A scar across the sky 
 You were looking for a king 
 You would never recognize 
 Jesus in disguise 
 Ever feel like you've been somewhere before 
 You hold the key, you know which door 
 Speak the word your lips have never known 
 Because your heart told you so 
 Jesus in disguise 
 Jehovah passing by 
 The burden of a tear 
 Hanging in your eye 
 Jesus in disguise 
 A scar across the sky 
 You were looking for a king 
 You would never recognize 
 Jesus in disguise 
 So open my eyes, wide as I can 
 Blind as I am, blind as I am 
 So open my eyes as wide as I can 
 Blind as I am, blind as I am 
 Jesus in disguise 
 Jesus in disguise

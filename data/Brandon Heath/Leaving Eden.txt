 Headlines read like a warning, we're under attack 
 (One more step away) 
 I just waved to a stranger, he didn't wave back 
 (One more step away) 
 And if it weren't for my TV, I wouldn't know what is real 
 (One more step away) 
 My doctor can't do a thing for how I feel 
 Feels like I'm leaving Eden 
 Feels like I'm leaving Eden 
 People are losing their homes to hurricanes

 Old lady living next door forgot her own name 
 (One more step away) 
 Teacher is hiding her Bible, but at least she's got a job 
 (One more step away) 
 My local Salvation Army just got robbed, ooh 
 Feels like I'm leaving Eden 
 Feels like I'm leaving Eden 
 Ooh 
 It's like I'm further away with every step I take 
 And I can't go back 
 'Cause I'm leaving Eden 
 I'm going, going home 
 I'm going, going home 
 There's no place, no place like home 
 Oh, there's no place, no place like home, home, ooh 
 When you're leaving Eden 
 When you're leaving Eden, ooh 
 It's like I'm further away with every step I take 
 And I can't go back 
 'Cause I'm leaving, leaving Eden 
 ... 
 I'm going, going home 
 I'm going, going home 
 There's no place, no place like home 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Ooh, ooh

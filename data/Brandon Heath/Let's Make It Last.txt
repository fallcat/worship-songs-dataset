Rain come down tonight 
 Except for the bump on my head 
 I'm feeling all right 
 Dancing to our favorite tune 
 I pulled you in way too soon 
 Bang went the drums, we went boom 
 Yeah 
 Running through the yard 
 Splashing through puddles with you without regard 
 Do you think the neighbors will care 
 So what if they do they'll just stare 
 The kids will all say it's not fair 
 The way that we love 
 The way that we laugh 
 It's something worth seeing 
 So let's make it last 
 Let's make it last 
 Come some sunny day 
 We'll call in sick to our jobs 
 What will we say 
 She's coming down with a flu 
 I think that I'm catching it too 
 This is what love makes you do 
 The way that we love 
 The way that we laugh 
 It's something worth seeing 
 So let's make it last 
 Live out each moment 
 They go by so fast 
 Let's make it last

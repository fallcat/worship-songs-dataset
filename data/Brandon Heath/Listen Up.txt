Why are you crying 
 Did I say something wrong 
 Were'nt we just talking 
 Tell me what's going on 
 'Cause I'm pretty sure my intentions 
 Were nothing more than conversation 
 Maybe you just needed someone 
 To listen to your heart 
 Maybe I spoke too soon 
 Maybe I said too much 
 Now that my face is blue 
 Think it's time I listen up 
 I've already said enough 
 Sometimes I do this 
 Thing is I'm so afraid 
 When it get's quiet 
 What you might have to say 
 'Cause I'm guilty of 
 Overcompensation 
 I'm lost in my 
 Own translation 
 I apologize, I know I 
 Should listen to your heart 
 There isn't anything that I could say 
 Not a word to get in the way 
 Of you, Of You, I am listening

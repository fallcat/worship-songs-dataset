My train pulled in to Waterloo 
 I found myself wishing you 
 Were here with me in London 
 Standing on the river Thames 
 Taking photographs of Parliament 
 And old Big Ben was ringing 
 You know it's everything that I imagined it would be 
 I had no idea that it would feel this empty 
 Where are you tonight 
 While I stand here and cry 
 Watching double-decker buses pass me by 
 And to tell you the truth 
 It's all that I can do 
 To keep from jumping a plane that's headed home 
 To you 
 I took a stroll down Abbey Road 
 Tried to peak inside the studio's 
 And somewhere along the way I bought you flowers 
 And a pocket map of the Underground 
 Cause You and I both know I get turned around 
 I'm so lost without you 
 Though it's everything that I imagined it would be 
 I had no idea that it would feel this empty 
 6 long nights and seven days I'll cross the pond back to the states 
 I can't wait 
 Where are you tonight while I stand here and cry 
 Watching all the black umbrellas pass me by 
 And to tell you the truth it's all that I can do 
 To keep from jumping on a plane headed home 
 So I'm jumping on a plane headed home to you

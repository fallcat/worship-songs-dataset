I have seen you in this place ever since I was a little boy 
 Reaching out from every corner of this room 
 It's so good to see your face, once again from a child's eyes 
 I can see You Father Your coming over me 
 Like the nature of a child 
 Lord you let me walk in to the wild 
 But I can hear you call me back to you 
 Your coming in loud and clear 
 As I turn my face to you I can see that everything is true 
 When I come back home I know I'll find you here 
 Too many years I've done without till I found someone to 
 Sing about 
 Makes me wonder what I've been doing all this time 
 Like the nature of a child 
 Lord you let me walk in to the wild 
 But I can hear you call me back to you 
 Your coming in loud and clear 
 Lord You bring me to my knees 
 Just when I thought that I already knew you 
 I couldn't hold you to anyone 
 I take the hand that made my hand 
 You opened up my eyes 
 I didn't know you till I knew your son 
 Like the nature of a child 
 Lord you let me walk in to the wild 
 But I can hear you call me back to you 
 Your coming in loud and clear

This one goes out to the world changer 
 Shining your light in the face of danger 
 Oh, tell us what you know 
 You're a saint, you're a son, you're a promise keeper 
 Bottom of the well, still digging down deeper 
 Oh, how far you gonna go 
 Chasing down hope 
 Moving on dreams 
 Taking that path 
 Maybe it'll lead you home 
 Maybe it won't 
 Nobody knows why your heart is broken 
 Nobody cries while your prayers are going up 
 But Love does 
 Nobody walks on the road you're paving 
 Nobody sees all the souls you're saving 
 Oh, but Love does 
 Love does 
 Love does 
 This is for the one on the front line fighting 
 Ringing that bell over everybody 
 Oh, tell us what you know 
 Knocking down doors in the midnight alley 
 Looking for a life in a desert valley 
 Oh, how far you gonna go 
 Chasing down hope 
 Moving on dreams 
 Taking that path 
 Maybe it'll lead you home 
 Maybe it don't 
 You are a renegade 
 You're an outlaw of Love's crusade 
 And they don't know who you are 
 They don't know 
 They don't know 
 But Love does 
 I'm telling you, Love does 
 Somebody knows 
 Somebody cries 
 Somebody feels 
 Love does 
 Somebody walks 
 Somebody sees 
 Somebody knows 
 Love does

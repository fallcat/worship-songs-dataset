We'll build a little cabin on a really tall hill 
 Plant a little garden, pray for every meal 
 And we'll grow and we'll grow 
 Take a little nap on the butterfly grass 
 Just you and I and the clouds that pass 
 Hold me close, hold me close 
 We'll be living out where the river bends 
 Where the grass gets green and the highway ends 
 Living easy 
 Where it's you and me, baby, and the daffodils 
 Kids growing up in the rolling hills 
 And love will be enough for us 
 Rain's coming down on the old tin roof 
 It's a lullaby storm in the middle of June 
 Falling slow, falling slow 
 So what are we doing on the seventh floor 
 Of a high rise apartment praying for more? 
 We'll build a little cabin on a really tall hill

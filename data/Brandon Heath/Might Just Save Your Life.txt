Don't make a sound 
 Hold your breath 
 We gotta go 
 Because the Devil thinks you're dead 
 Turn around 
 Face the door 
 Where you been sleeping 
 Isn't safe anymore 
 Uh, huh, uh, huh, yeah 
 I know you thought 
 Your faith was gone 
 But I'm as real as the fire 
 That you're on 
 I'm not afraid 
 Know how to fight 
 And I ain't leaving here 
 Alone tonight 
 Uh, huh, uh, huh, yeah 
 It might just save your life 
 Uh, huh, oh, yeah 
 It might just save you 
 Just because you give up on yourself 
 Doesn't mean that I gave up myself, myself, oh 
 Might just save your life, yeah 
 Don't be afraid 
 Stand up and fight 
 'Cause I ain't leaving here 
 Alone tonight 
 Uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh 
 It might just save your life 
 Uh, huh, uh, huh 
 It might just save your life 
 Uh, huh, uh, huh 
 It might just save your life 
 Uh, huh, uh, huh 
 It might just save your life

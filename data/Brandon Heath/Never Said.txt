If this isn't exactly 
 All that stuff you never said 
 It only existed in my head 
 You caught me unexpecting 
 Here with nothing left to say 
 But you insist that it's ok 
 I'm sitting here tonight 
 And I'm hoping I heard you right 
 You don't have to take it all way 
 'Cause it's exactly what I thought you'd never say 
 Lately we've been busy 
 You've got your work and I've got mine 
 And were lucky if we find the time at all 
 To talk about our feelings 
 About what's been going on inside 
 All I can do lately is hide 
 You hold me in your hand 
 Don't mistake me, that I don't understand 
 You don't have to take it all away 
 'Cause it's exactly what I thought you'd never say 
 Lately when you speak to me 
 It's taking everything I have inside 
 To keep my feet on the ground 
 And what else can I say to you 
 When your hearts already spoken for mine 
 I've fallen this time 
 If this isn't exactly 
 All that stuff you never said 
 It only existed in my head

No better word than from your lips 
 No perfect life than what you lived 
 No greater gift, no not one 
 No brighter star has ever shined 
 No better hope for all mankind 
 No higher mind, no not one 
 No one has ever known 
 This kind of love you've shown 
 There has never been a greater love 
 Than your son 
 No. Not one 
 And there'll never be a greater love 
 No, Not one 
 With his life you have forgiven us 
 Hope has come 
 Hope has come 
 And there will never be a greater love 
 No, Not one 
 No image true or sweeter frame 
 No simple word can match your name 
 No greater fame 
 No not one 
 No one has ever seen 
 The depth of your majesty 
 No greater call 
 You gave us all a reason to live 
 No greater love 
 You gave us all a reason to give 
 No greater life 
 You gave us all a reason to shine 
 No greater love 
 Forever mine

I have decided 
 I called out his name 
 I'm following Jesus now and 
 He knows the way 
 I made up my mind 
 I leave it behind 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 I'm moving on 
 Not looking back 
 I'm giving him 
 All that I have 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 Though I may wander 
 I am not lost 
 So many distractions 
 But I, I look to the cross 
 I made up my mind 
 I leave it behind 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 I'm moving on 
 Not looking back 
 I'm giving him 
 All that I have 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 You want to come with me 
 He loves you the same 
 Oh, won't you come with me? 
 (Oh, won't you come with me?) 
 Just call out his name 
 (Just call out his name) 
 Say I have decided 
 (I have decided) 
 To follow Jesus 
 (To follow Jesus) 
 Say I have decided 
 (I have decided) 
 I'm following Jesus 
 (Following Jesus) 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 I'm moving on 
 Not looking back 
 I'm giving him 
 All that I have 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 I'm giving Him all I have now 
 No turning back 
 Giving Him all I have 
 No turning back 
 There's no turning back 
 No turning back 
 Giving Him all I have 
 No turning back 
 I have decided

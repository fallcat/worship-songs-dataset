You make me drunk like dad's whisky 
 When I was thirteen years old 
 Now I've got my nose pressed down on the table 
 Like I'm waiting for him to come home 
 My thought's keep rolling like boulders 
 Sharp off the tip of my tongue 
 I know he'd say "Son, you're a man, stop crying." 
 But daddy I still feel so young 
 Hold me, I will hold you back 
 Nothing but the chill will let you go 
 Outside the rust just keeps building 
 Around the gate of my fence 
 Last time I checked it was you I was mending 
 And nothing else needed me since 
 Over the streets in the city 
 Winter is bringing her chill 
 I hear her calling at the top of the chimney 
 But I'm not inviting her in 
 Hold me, I will hold you back 
 Nothing but the chill will let you go 
 Love me, I will love you back 
 Nothing but the chill will let you go 
 There's no way I'm ever letting go

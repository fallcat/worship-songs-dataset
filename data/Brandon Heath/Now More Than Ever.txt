Dig my hands into the earth 
 Sometimes I need You so bad, it hurts 
 I want You now more than ever 
 I've been living in a foreign land 
 Confession of a broken man 
 I want You now more than ever 
 The more I see, the more I want 
 The more I know, it doesn't stop 
 Your beauty speaks to call me home 
 Now more than ever 
 The more I feel that You are here 
 The more the world disappears 
 And all I want is to be home 
 Now more than ever 
 So tell me something that I haven't heard 
 I'll be hanging on every word 
 I want You now more than ever 
 How long must You make me wait? 
 Give me hope, give me strength 
 I want You now more than ever 
 I will keep my eyes open 
 Keep my eyes open, face to the sky 
 I will keep my eyes open 
 Keep my eyes open for You

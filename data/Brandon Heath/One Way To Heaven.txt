Everybody's searching for home 
 Staring at a hole in the sky 
 Poor man waiting on a break 
 Rich man looking for a ticket to buy 
 Something ties us together 
 All colors of the same race 
 Shadows of the same face 
 Looking up 
 Ain't no doorway 
 Or a stairway 
 Ain't no your way 
 Ain't no my way 
 Ain't no shortcut 
 Or a highway to Heaven 
 Ain't no jet plane 
 Ain't no fast car 
 Only one thing take you that far 
 Only one name 
 He's the one way to Heaven 
 One way to Heaven 
 One way to Heaven 
 Straight and narrow is the road 
 That lays out before us 
 It's easy to lose our direction 
 Let love be the compass 
 Temptations are many 
 And the pitfalls are countless 
 There's only one way 
 He is the way 
 Only one way 
 Only one way 
 Only one way to Heaven 
 Only one way 
 Only one way 
 Only one way to Heaven 
 Only one way 
 Only one way 
 Only one way 
 Ain't no doorway 
 Only one way 
 Ain't no your way 
 Only one way 
 Ain't no short cut 
 Only one way 
 One way to Heaven

Lost in my wilderness 
 In all Your tenderness 
 You found me hiding in the night 
 Reached out Your gentle hand 
 I did not understand 
 You spoke a word and there was light 
 Said You've only just begun 
 And if You've only just begun 
 What can I do 
 I can't explain it 
 But my heart is beating faster 
 So this how Heaven feels 
 Jesus, Your love I can't deny 
 I'm so completely 
 Whole-hearted head over heels 
 And I only just met You 
 I only just met You 
 You give me galaxies 
 Wash me in salty seas 
 It's almost more than I can bear 
 There's not a single fear 
 It cannot touch me here 
 I can't remember who I was 
 And You've only just begun 
 And if You've only just begun 
 Oh, what can I do 
 Only gets better, only gets better 
 Only gets better from here 
 Only gets better, only gets better 
 Only gets better from here 
 For such a mystery 
 It makes so much sense to me 
 And I only just met You 
 Only just, only just met You 
 Only gets better from here 
 Only just, only just met You 
 Only gets better from here 
 Only gets better, only gets better 
 Only gets better from here 
 Only gets better, only gets better 
 Only gets better from here

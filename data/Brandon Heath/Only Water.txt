There's a shadow coming 
 As the sky goes black 
 It's a stubborn rain 
 On a Nebraska plain 
 There's a farmer standing 
 On a thirsty ground 
 He holds his breath 
 This is life or death 
 It's only water 
 And it washes over me 
 Like a single river stone 
 Changes everything 
 But has no power on its own 
 It's only water 
 There's a winding canyon 
 Where a mountain stood 
 Miles of earth and clay 
 Carried far away 
 But there's something holy 
 In these cathedral walls 
 They took a lot of years 
 And a lot of tears 
 It's only water 
 And it washes over me 
 Like a single river stone 
 Changes everything 
 But has no power on its own 
 It's only water 
 There once was a wedding 
 All the wine was gone 
 They said He's just a man 
 That's where it all began 
 It was only water 
 And it washes over me 
 Like a single river stone 
 Changes everything 
 But has no power on its own 
 It washes over me 
 Like a single river stone 
 Changes everything 
 But has no power on its own, on its own 
 It's only water

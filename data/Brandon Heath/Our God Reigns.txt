Yours and so much mine 
 By the morning, light is Thine 
 Perfect by design 
 Mighty to man, light of the earth 
 Sending His Son to echo His worth 
 Breaker of sin, winner of souls 
 Every creature will know 
 Our God reigns over the heavens 
 Over the earth, Our God reigns 
 Praise His name, All still standing 
 All that was, all that remains 
 Our God reigns 
 Deepest Ocean opened wide 
 So shall love divide 
 In devotion to His bride 
 Standing by her side 
 Mighty to man, Light of the earth 
 He's sending His Son to echo His worth 
 Breaker of sin, winner of souls 
 Every creature will know 
 Our God reigns over the heavens 
 Over the earth, Our God reigns 
 Praise His name, All still standing 
 All that was, all that remains 
 Our God reigns 
 So much Holy, So divine 
 Yours and so much mine

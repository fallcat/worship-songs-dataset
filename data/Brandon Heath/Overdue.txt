Sometimes Father I think I can feel you bleed 
 As I fall in to the middle of the pages that I read 
 Did you wake me up this morning to be taught 
 To be lead into the clutches of the people that you sought 
 The view from here is all but clear 
 You have my heart, and I just wher to start 
 That's why I follow you 
 And sometime s father I don't think I understand 
 You insist that I am worthy of your sacrificial hand 
 And every time I think of what you went through for 
 Your beloved children always you so gracefully adore 
 You couldn't stay 
 You made a way eternity 
 And you gave us all eternity 
 That's why we thank you lord 
 It's why we praise you 
 Lord 
 Abba Father I am caught in your embrace 
 I am witnessing the beauty of 
 Your undeserving grace 
 Still I ask you Father, what am I to do 
 With a broken hearted story 
 That which brought me here to you 
 Your love is true 
 And it's overdue, but I love you too

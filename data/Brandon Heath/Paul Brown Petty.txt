Paul Brown Petty was a good ol' man 
 You felt a little better when he shook your hand 
 Let me tell you a little 'bout him and you'll understand 
 Why Paul Brown Petty was a good ol' man 
 He grew up in the depression and he fought in the war 
 He never talked too much about the other shore 
 But he was real good-looking in his uniform 
 Officer Petty in '44 
 And you might say, hey, what's so great 
 Sounds like a simple man 
 He wasn't rich or famous but to me 
 He sure was grand 
 He married a girl from down the street 
 Built her a house down by a creek 
 One girl, two boys, five mouths to feed 
 Paul Brown Petty built a family 
 He opened a shop down on the square 
 He'd set you on up in his barber chair 
 Get a summertime buzz or a real close shave 
 Get you all cleaned up, send you on your way 
 He was a Cumberland Presbyterian 
 He went up to meet his maker in '91 
 Sometimes when I talk about him, I get sad 
 You see, Paul Brown Petty was my granddad 
 His courage runs down in my blood 
 His kindness in my eyes 
 If you can see a man in me 
 He's the reason why 
 Paul Brown Petty was a good ol' man 
 You felt a little better when he shook your hand 
 And if you could've known him, you'd understand 
 Why Paul Brown Petty was a good ol' man

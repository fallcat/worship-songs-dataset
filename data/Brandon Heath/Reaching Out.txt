What if you and I went for a walk out in the rain 
 And you turned to me and you said you'd like to share 
 Just a little of your pain 
 Well my brother I thought you'd never say 
 I've been waiting forever for this day 
 What if you were to call me up and ask 
 For a minute of my time' 
 And you cried and said you were different from the rest 
 Like it was some kind of crime 
 Well my sister I hoped that you might come 
 And I promise that you are not the only one 
 Look me in the eye and tell me honestly 
 What ever lies behind your broken heart 
 Is too complex for me 
 Come and talk to me if for only for a while 
 I am reaching for you 
 What if you were to tell me you were through 
 With the way that you live 
 Cause you take so much from an empty world outside 
 You've got nothing left to give 
 Well my brother I've felt the same way too 
 But someone changed me and He's got his eye on you 
 What if you remembered who you were 
 Before people broke you down 
 And you realized you were someone's little girl 
 And he loves when you're around 
 We'll my sister, your dad has seen you hurt 
 And He's waiting for you with open arms 
 Nothing hurts Him more than seeing you in pain 
 Just to see you come so close to Him 
 And turn and walk away 
 Hide yourself in Him, He will make you brand new 
 He is reaching out for you 
 Your God is reaching out for you 
 He's reaching out for you

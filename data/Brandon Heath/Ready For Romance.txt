I used to think that love was just a sentiment for people with a lot of emotion 
 Right up until I turned twenty three 
 I've been thinking about these people buying tickets 
 Just to see their honey across the ocean 
 When I could just stay right here for free 
 A combination of alone and alive just came right over me 
 And this picture of you came into view 
 And you set the wild heart free 
 I showed my independence to the door 
 Took off my shoes and slid across the floor 
 And then I watched When Harry Met Sally once more 
 I'm lost without you 
 I never stood chance 
 I'm tired of freedom 
 I'm ready for romance 
 I'm skipping all that pre-relation preparation 
 Take it one step at a heart ache 
 Just give me some room and let her fly 
 I'll search every little town up and down the heartlands full of prosperity 
 Without any rest till she's next to me 
 A combination of alone and alive just came right over me 
 And this picture of you came into view 
 And you set this wild heart free 
 Let's show our independence to the door 
 Took off our shoes and slide across the floor 
 And we can watch When Harry Met Sally once more 
 I'm lost without you 
 I never stood chance 
 I'm tired of freedom 
 I'm ready for romance

There's a man on my street 
 He reminds me everyday 
 Better take what you can get 
 Cause there's nothing more than this 
 Daylight fades into the ground, 
 Oh Lord I need You now 
 Cover me 
 With the red sky tonight 
 The promise of a better day to come 
 Sing over me 
 An angelic symphony 
 Tell me everything will be alright 
 With the red sky tonight 
 We're so taking with our fear 
 Now we're folded up in shame 
 With our feet nailed to the floor 
 We're the only ones to blame 
 I can't help but wonder why 
 Nobody bats an eye 
 You can see it in the faces 
 Of all the passers by 
 I'll sail into the sun 
 And when the day is done 
 I need you in the night 
 To wake me in the dawn 
 I see you in the sun 
 When the day is done 
 It's the red sky 
 It's the red sky 
 Tonight

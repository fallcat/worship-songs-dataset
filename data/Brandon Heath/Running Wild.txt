She wasn't looking for an answer to an ordinary prayer 
 She just liked to be around him 
 She liked knowing he was there 
 She saw something no one else could see 
 Way beyond his gentle eyes 
 And it was more than just a moment 
 When she finally realized 
 That she can feel his arms around her 
 Even when he's not around 
 And it's worth her while 
 To see him smile 
 Her heart is running wild for him 
 He wasn't looking for a reason 
 A certain time a perfect place 
 He just liked to be around her 
 And he loved the beauty of her face 
 And he knew something no one else could know about 
 A mystery that he will never tell 
 When she whispers softly to him 
 It's a voice he knows so well 
 And he can talk to her for hours 
 And still have so much more to say 
 And if you asked him now 
 I bet he'd tell you how 
 His heart is running wild for her 
 Now they stand together before the father and the son 
 Two hearts longing for each other are living now as one 
 And you can almost hear the angels 
 You know their singing from above 
 About the beauty of a Father's love 
 His heart is running wild for them 
 All for them

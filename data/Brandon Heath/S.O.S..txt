I've been blinded by insecurity 
 And all the pain I feel 
 Could be the death of me 
 I'm surrounded by 
 Fear that won't let go 
 If there's a way out 
 Someone let me know 
 I'm reaching out 
 One last plea 
 Is hope all gone 
 Somebody save me 
 SOS, I'm lost at sea 
 Is hope all gone 
 Somebody save me 
 I've seen traces of 
 Joy that never ends 
 But it seems so far away 
 If it's even real 
 There must be more than this 
 So change me if it's true 
 If You are for real 
 Help me follow You 
 Why do I do the things I don't wanna do 
 I don't wanna do 
 When all they do is hurt me 
 Why do I do the things I don't wanna do 
 I don't wanna do 
 When all they do is hurt me 
 Why do I do the things I don't wanna do 
 I don't wanna do 
 When all they do is hurt me

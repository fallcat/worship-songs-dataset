Just try to follow me 
 'Cause I got something that I wanna say 
 And I know it sounds crazy 
 But I'm gonna tell you anyway 
 When I close my eyes lately I'm so far from sleep 
 As I lie mostly awake 
 You're always on my mind for as long as a night takes 
 Through the dark I toss and turn with you it's all I can do 
 I've got my heart set on you 
 We're living out our destiny 
 God had plans for you and me 
 Way before eternity began 
 Sure as an age old burning fire 
 Your gonna see my hearts desire 
 Has found it's way to you 
 Where it belongs 
 So as time goes by 
 As long as I'm with you 
 You'll know the reason why 
 Finding as I'm growing old with you 
 There's a love still brand-new 
 'Cause I've got my heart set on you

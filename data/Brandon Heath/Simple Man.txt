Keep on keepin' on believin' 
 You've never given me a reason to drop my faith 
 And I won't leave you 
 Just for the sake of leavin' 
 'Cause I got every reason to stay 
 It's a good little time to settle down my world 
 But you took a hold of me 
 And then I told you 
 I promise to stand for you 
 But you gotta tell me what's it gonna be 
 Yeah yeah 
 I'm just a simple man 
 A little part of a bigger plan 
 Everything that gives me worth, God, it's you 
 So take the rest of me 
 Cause you got the best of me 
 Everything good in me comes from you 
 God all of me hides in you 
 Oh God my home is your hands 
 Within me, into the world you send me 
 Now I gotta tell the truth to everyone that I can 
 Yeah yeah 
 I'm just a simple man 
 A little part of a bigger plan 
 Everything that gives me worth, God, it's you 
 You you 
 So take the rest of me 
 Cause you got the best of me 
 Everything good in me comes from you 
 I'm just a simple man 
 A little part of a bigger plan 
 Everything that gives me worth, God, it's you 
 So take the rest of me 
 Cause you got the best of me 
 Everything good in me comes from you

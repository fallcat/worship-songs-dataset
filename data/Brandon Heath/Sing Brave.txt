I remember the first time I heard my own voice 
 It wasn't quite music, just a fumbling noise 
 The sound sneaking out in my very own words 
 Momma said was the prettiest song that she'd heard 
 Second grade homeroom, I remember it well 
 It was my turn to share for the class show-and-tell 
 I couldn't find something from my room to bring 
 Momma said, darlin', why don't you sing 
 Sing them a song you feel deep in your heart 
 Sing it with everything that you are 
 Sing till your voice echoes all through the room 
 Pick a good one but whatever you do 
 Sing brave 
 Sing brave 
 My teenage soapbox was a Gibson guitar 
 I played that old ax on the back of my car 
 There must have been thousands of songs hid inside 
 But I just kept diggin' to see what I'd find 
 And His name was Jesus, I heard from a friend 
 Seemed all of my life I'd been looking for Him 
 See my voice was changing 
 Now my heart was, too 
 This boy was singing a different tune 
 Now every night before I walk on stage 
 All of my butterflies just fly away (fly away) 
 'Cause Jesus is listening, yeah, I know He's here 
 When love's in the room, you got nothing to fear 
 He says, sing me a song you feel deep in your heart 
 Sing it with everything that you are 
 Sing till your voice dances all through the room 
 Pick a good one, but whatever you do 
 Sing brave 
 Sing brave 
 Sing brave (sing brave) 
 Sing brave

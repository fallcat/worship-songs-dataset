What a day it must have been 
 Finding out that you'd be rolling in 
 The driveway again 
 People calling up to say hello 
 Wondering why you never just said so 
 We thought we'd never know 
 Well, maybe I could call you 
 I wonder how you'd be 
 Did you get the letters or ever think of me 
 People always coming up and saying to me 
 She's thinking about bringing up a family 
 You know it's harder than it used to be 
 They say sometimes you bring up my name 
 You wanna catch a spark from a small town flame 
 Well, maybe I could hide, but then I'd be cruel 
 Tell you that I love you but then I'd be a fool 
 But maybe all I am is a lonely fool 
 Foolishly in love with a woman who 
 I never really knew 
 When I needed you, you were gone with the wind 
 I never really knew how the story began 
 Or if it would ever end 
 But the wind blows strong tonight 
 And you small town flame 
 He's out like a light 
 Maybe I could hide but then I'd be cruel 
 Tell you that I love you, but then I'd be a fool 
 But maybe all I am just a fool 
 Foolishly in love with a woman who 
 I never really knew 
 When I needed you, you were gone with the wind 
 I never really knew how the story began 
 Or if it would ever end 
 But the wind blows strong tonight 
 And you small town flame 
 He's out like a light

Remember the time when I thought of letting go and taking back my hand 
 When all I could think was how long can I follow you 
 And where do I stand in this world 
 And when I thought I couldn't go along, 
 God I'm not that strong to walk through the valley with you 
 And though it still remains a mystery what you see in me 
 You come back for me every time 
 Just like a soldier you battle for my soul 
 More like a Father you come and take me home 
 What is the worth of a man living for himself with a heart of his own 
 He comes to your table with his hands reaching out to you 
 Father, wont you please give me more 
 God, I've come to see your heart for me 
 How it breaks for me 
 To witness a son fall away 
 So come and take me as you see me now 
 Jesus show me how you claimed me to be by your side 
 Just like a soldier you battle for my soul 
 More like a Father you come and take me home 
 You placed your spirit inside of me 
 A love more consuming than I thought it could be 
 And I'll take this love, this holiest flame 
 And give up this fight 
 Lord I remember, I remember 
 Just like a soldier you battle for my soul 
 More like a Father you come and take me home

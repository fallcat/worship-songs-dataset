Your down all the way down 
 Can't shake the feeling 
 I know you know that I know 
 You got your reasons 
 Sore eyes what's up with that face 
 Maybe well trace these lines 
 Back to fine 
 I'm sure 
 You've been here before 
 Sore eyes 
 Such a sight to see 
 If I can bring that light 
 Back to your eyes to stay 
 What would you say 
 What do you say

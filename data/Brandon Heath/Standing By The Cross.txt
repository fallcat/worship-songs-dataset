Sweet the moments, rich in blessing 
 Which before the cross I spend 
 Life and health and peace possessing 
 From the sinners only Friend 
 Here I'll rest forever viewing 
 Mercy poured in streams of blood 
 Precious drops my soul bedewing 
 Plead and claim my peace with God 
 Standing by the cross 
 The cross of Calvary 
 Looking up to my sweet Jesus 
 Mercy given full and free 
 Truly blessed is the station 
 Low before His cross to lie 
 While I see divine compassion 
 Beaming in his gracious eye 
 Here I feel my sins forgiven 
 While upon the Lamb I gaze 
 And my thoughts are all of heaven 
 And my lips overflow with praise 
 Standing by the cross 
 The Cross of Calvary 
 Looking up to my sweet Jesus 
 Mercy given full and free

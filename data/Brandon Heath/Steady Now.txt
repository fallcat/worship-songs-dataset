There's an air, everywhere 
 Of inconsideration and despair 
 I don't consider you 
 And you don't consider me 
 And it's well understood 
 We don't care 
 You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night 
 Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right 
 We're all victims in a battle 
 We never had to fight 
 It's okay 
 It's all right 
 Steady now 
 We're in this thing together 
 We're in this thing together 
 I regret that I forget 
 Confessions always seem to stay unsaid 
 And maybe I worry 
 That you'll forsake me 
 Use my shame as a weapon 
 And go on and break me 
 You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night 
 Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right 
 We're all victims in a battle 
 We never had to fight 
 It's okay 
 It's all right 
 Steady now 
 We're in this thing together 
 'Cause I want to take the time to say I'm sorry 
 I haven't loved you the way I should 
 Do you think that you could 
 Forgive me 
 Just try to hear me out 
 I need you with me now 
 You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night 
 Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right 
 We're all victims in a battle 
 We never had to fight 
 It's okay 
 It's all right 
 You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night 
 Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right 
 We're all victims in a battle 
 We never had to fight 
 It's okay 
 It's all right 
 Steady now 
 We're in this thing together 
 Steady now

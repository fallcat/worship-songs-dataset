I'm a fugitive 
 Running from the life that I was meant to live 
 Looking for somewhere that I can lay my head 
 I'm lucky if I make it through the night 
 But I can't sleep 
 Knowing that You're one more step ahead of me 
 I'm a fool for ever thinking You'd just let me go 
 That's not the way it's ever gone before, I'm Yours 
 You catch me like a thief in the night 
 You hold me when I put up a fight 
 You chase me when I run from Your light 
 Because You love, You won't give up 
 'Til my heart is stolen 
 (My heart is stolen) 
 'Til my heart is stolen away 
 (My heart is stolen away) 
 I'm trying to understand that life comes after dying 
 To embrace that I'm a slave until I'm captured 
 But You would never use a lock or a key 
 'Cause I am free 
 You catch me like a thief in the night 
 You hold me when I put up a fight 
 You chase me when I run from Your light 
 Because You love, You won't give up 
 'Til my heart is stolen 
 (My heart is stolen) 
 'Til my heart is stolen away 
 (My heart is stolen away) 
 'Til my heart is stolen 
 (My heart is stolen) 
 My heart is stolen 
 I could change my name, cover all my tracks 
 But I'm wrong to think I could lose the past 
 'Cause You found me here and You took me back 
 Once a criminal, now a prodigal 
 You catch me like a thief in the night 
 You hold me when I put up a fight 
 You chase me when I run from Your light 
 Because You love, You won't give up 
 'Til my heart is stolen 
 (My heart is stolen) 
 'Til my heart is stolen away 
 (My heart is stolen away) 
 'Til my heart is stolen 
 (My heart is stolen) 
 My heart is stolen away 
 (My heart is stolen away)

You wanna sound off but you can't find the words to 
 Nothin' makes sense in the way that it used to 
 Can't find the plus in the positive thinking 
 The well's run dry and you're not done drinking 
 Clouds start comin' and the sky will fall 
 Clock stares back from the bedroom wall 
 Now you're breathin' just to make it through the night 
 All you need is a sunrise 
 Just a moment of dawn 
 If you're lost in the twilight 
 Close your eyes and move on 
 When you're tired in the waiting 
 Even though it's gonna take you 
 A little more time 
 Just a little more time the sun's gonna find you 
 Holding your days like a stack of paper 
 Then you're chasing the wind as the pages scatter 
 You can save a few but you can't get 'em all back 
 So get out fast with your heart in tact 
 Find yourself on the very edge 
 Lying awake in an empty bed 
 Now you're breathin' just to make it through the night

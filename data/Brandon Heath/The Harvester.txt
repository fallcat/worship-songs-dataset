Up with the dawn and the rooster crow 
 Been that way since I don't know 
 Throw a little water on my face 
 Get out the door and greet the day 
 Put my knees down on the ground 
 Sing to the Lord in a weary sound 
 Ask Him for the strength I need 
 Break my heart like a weed 
 For all that we've grown 
 How could we forget 
 Those who don't know 
 Or just don't know yet 
 Let's harvest this field 
 From sunrise to sunset 
 The Master is coming 
 We are not done yet 
 We are not done yet 
 Yet 
 Bring out the sickle 
 Bring out the pail 
 Bushel full of wire 
 And a fork to the bale 
 Work through the pain in the rain or shine 
 C'mon y'all we still got time 
 We still got time 
 For all that we've grown 
 How could we forget 
 Those who don't know 
 Or just don't know yet 
 Let's harvest this field 
 From sunrise to sunset 
 The Master is coming 
 We are not done yet 
 We are not done yet 
 Yet 
 Yet 
 The turning of the season 
 Is upon us, my friends 
 Now's the time 
 All that was sown 
 Is there for the reaping 
 For all that we've grown 
 How could we forget 
 Those who don't know 
 Or just don't know yet 
 Let's harvest this field 
 From sunrise to sunset 
 The Master is coming 
 We are not done yet 
 We are not done yet 
 Yet 
 Yet

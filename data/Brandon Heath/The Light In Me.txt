My life before You 
 I was a flame burning down 
 I was burning out 
 But You knew me better 
 For You there was never a doubt 
 God, since You gave me life 
 Something was different, I knew it the instant 
 You put the light in me 
 This spark is shot to the heart 
 You are the hope that leads me out of the dark 
 You let Your love shine down 
 So that the world could see 
 You put the light in me 
 The light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 You are the Maker, you tell the sun when to rise 
 I'm just a house on a hill 
 But You make me brighter than all the stars in the sky 
 Keep me from growing down 
 'Cause in Your perfection, I'm just a reflection 
 So pull me closer to You 
 I catch like a fire and I'll hold You higher 
 'Cause You put the light in me 
 This spark is shot to the heart 
 You are the hope that leads me out of the dark 
 You let Your love shine down 
 So that the world could see 
 You put the light in me 
 The light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 I'll raise it high, I'll let it show 
 From the rooftops down to the streets below 
 In day and night, You will be known 
 And all will see 
 You put the light in me 
 'Cause You put the light in me 
 This spark is shot to the heart 
 You are the hope that leads me out of the dark 
 You let Your love shine down 
 So that the world could see 
 You put the light in me 
 The light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me 
 You put the light, the light, You put the light in me

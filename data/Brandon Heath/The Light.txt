The hand that feeds the fire 
 The lips that taste the smoke 
 All together once again 
 The moon that hangs so pale 
 The dark that makes you choke 
 Comes to cover you again 
 Stay close you people with your broken hearts 
 I stand for you as a witness 
 Hold tight to the man that stands in front of you 
 As we move toward the light 
 The will that knows no end 
 The eyes that see your heart 
 Come to look on you once more 
 The word that shakes the ground 
 The voice that calms the sea 
 Stands knocking at your door 
 Stay close you people with your broken hearts 
 I stand for you as a witness 
 Hold tight to the man that stands in front of you 
 As we move toward the light

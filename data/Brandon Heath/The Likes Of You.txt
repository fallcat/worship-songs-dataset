It never fails to make me laugh how you get so mad at me 
 The way I watch you when you move, you get so mad at me 
 You try to make me look away but I'm taken by the view 
 The perfect vision of my dreams, what I see when I see you 
 You try to turn me on to art but it's just not quite the same 
 Do you expect me to compare something locked behind a frame 
 All the color of your heart what's a painter supposed to do 
 There's no stroke of any brush that could paint the likes of you 
 Your sweet security, your elusive mystery 
 Is just enough to keep me on my feet 
 When we're dancing in the street you never miss a beat 
 The beat of my heart 
 Let the wind catch your dress, let the sunlight stain your face 
 Girl, I love to watch you move with your balance and your grace 
 Please forgive my wondering eyes if they've found a place to rest 
 On the beauty of your soul on the smile that I love best

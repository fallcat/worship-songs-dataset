Empty manger, perfect stranger, about to be born 
 Into darkness, sadness, desperate madness, creation so torn 
 We were so lost on earth, no peace, no worth, no way to escape 
 In fear, no faith, no hope, no grace, and no light 
 But that was the night before Christmas 
 Warm hay, cold sweat, a mother, not yet, praying Godspeed the dawn 
 She looks to her man, holding her hand, they wonder how long 
 And the shepherds, wise men come to find them, and bow to a king 
 One star above shining on love, so bright it lit up the night before Christmas 
 And the world didn't know mercy was meek and so mild 
 And the world didn't know that truth was as pure as a child 
 The night before Christmas 
 The night before Christmas 
 And the world didn't know, redemption was sweet and so strong 
 And the world didn't know salvation was writing a song 
 The night before Christmas 
 The night before Christmas 
 The night before Christmas 
 Empty manger, perfect stranger, about to be born

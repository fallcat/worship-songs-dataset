If I see one more light that's fading 
 Hear about one more broken dream 
 Pray for just one more faith that's dying 
 It's one too many 
 And if I see one more child walking 
 Just one more mile for water 
 If I wait one more minute longer 
 It's one too many 
 When I think of what could be 
 If we let our hearts believe 
 That it takes just one 
 Just one could turn this all around 
 And if we're living history 
 How will they think of you and me 
 If it takes just one, just one 
 What if, what if, what if I'm the one? 
 It takes one, takes one, one 
 It takes one, takes one, one 
 It takes one, takes one 
 If I hear one more widow crying 
 'Cause there's no one by her side 
 And if I see one more family breaking 
 It's one too many 
 If there's one thing that I'm sure of 
 If there's one thing that I know 
 You could be one in a sea of faces 
 Or you could be one more chance for hope 
 When I think of what could be 
 If we let our hearts believe 
 That it takes just one 
 Just one could turn this all around 
 And if we're living history 
 How will they think of you and me 
 If it takes just one, just one 
 What if, what if, what if I'm the one? 
 I see a nation without any walls 
 A beautiful haven for one and for all 
 I see a day when people are free 
 When shackles are broken and fall to the street 
 A voice, a cry, call out from on high 
 The first one of many, go lay down your life 
 When I think of what could be 
 If we let our hearts believe 
 That it takes just one 
 Just one could turn this all around 
 And if we're living history 
 How will they think of you and me 
 If it takes just one, just one 
 What if, what if, what if I'm the one? 
 It takes one, takes one, one 
 (What if you're the one) 
 It takes one, takes one, one 
 It takes one, takes one 
 (What if I'm the one) 
 It takes one, takes one, one 
 (What if you're the one) 
 It takes one, takes one, one 
 It takes one, takes one

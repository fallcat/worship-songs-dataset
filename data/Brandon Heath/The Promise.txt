If you wait for me 
 Then I'll come for you 
 Although I traveled far 
 I'll always hold a place for you 
 In my heart 
 If you think of me 
 If you miss me once in a while 
 Then I'll return to you 
 I'll return and fill that space in your heart 
 Remembering your touch 
 Your kiss your warm embrace 
 I'll find my way back to you 
 If you'll be waiting 
 If you dream of me 
 Like I dream of you 
 In a place that's warm and dark 
 In a place where I 
 Can feel the beating of your heart 
 Oh I've longed for you 
 And I have desired 
 To see your place your smile 
 To be with you wherever you are 
 Together again 
 It would feel so good to be 
 In your arms 
 Where all my journeys end 
 You can make a promise 
 If it's one that you can keep 
 I bow to come for you 
 If you will wait for me

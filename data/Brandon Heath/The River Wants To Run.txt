Father you love flows though your kingdom like a mighty river 
 You children come down to Your banks to drink the living water 
 Your holiness abounds 
 Come Lord of all surround us 
 Reveal your endless power and Your glory 
 Let your spirit rise until your truth is overflowing in this land 
 If the river wants to run who's gonna stop it now 
 Who's gonna keep those flood gates from bending 
 We'll take this broken land and turn it into a temple 
 Light it with your fire that is unending 
 So take this broken man and turn him into a temple 
 Light him with your fire that is unending

Every time I come back to this rock 
 You've reminded me that I am not alone 
 That I will never been alone 
 When I turn to see that the tides have changed 
 The people change and I am not the same 
 No I will never be the same 
 Hey did you know that you fed my soul 
 The day that you opened up to me 
 I just couldn't be still and tie down my will 
 I just wanted to run with you 
 I thank my God every time I remember you 
 When I start to think about you and me and how we came to be 
 I start to think about time and how we made it through fine 
 And then I turn to see that the times have changed 
 The people change and I am not the same 
 No I will never be the same 
 Hey did you know that you fed my soul 
 The day that you opened up to me 
 I just couldn't be still and tie down my will 
 I just wanted to run with you 
 I thank my God every time I remember you 
 Ever since you stepped foot on this rock 
 You know it doesn't really matter how you came 
 We will never be the same

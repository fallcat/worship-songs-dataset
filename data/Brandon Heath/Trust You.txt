I can't walk without watching where I'm going 
 I can't speak without knowing what to say 
 I can't love and have any hesitation 
 'Cause I know that you don't work that way 
 I can't reach without something to offer 
 I can't come now I am so ashamed 
 I can't hold out from you any longer 
 'Cause I know that you don't work that way 
 I'm not gonna fight you anymore 
 Not gonna try to lock the door 
 You took your life and gave me yours 
 There's no reason why 
 I shouldn't trust you with mine 
 It's never easy changing my direction 
 It's so unnatural to loosen up my grip 
 Are you growing weary of all my good intentions 
 'Cause I know that You don't work that way 
 Somedays 
 This wait upon my shoulder 
 Is my shame 
 I know I should know better 
 Cause you say 
 That I must now surrender 
 There's no other way

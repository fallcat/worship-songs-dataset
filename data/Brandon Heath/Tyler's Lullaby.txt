Lay down my child 
 Close your eyes one more time 
 Let the night take you softly into sleep 
 Sure as the moon shining on your sweet face 
 Be rest assured you will be safe 
 In this place 
 The sweetest gift 
 God has given me 
 Graced with the tiniest beauty 
 These eyes have seen 
 Soft as the song of a winter wind 
 Sheltered by love 
 A love that will never end 
 Life so often a mystery 
 And each of us seeking a clue 
 To an answer I never thought I'd find 
 When I lost you 
 But in your time with me 
 Somehow you taught me to see 
 Just as in life 
 Even in death 
 You always will be here with me 
 So lay down my child 
 Close your eyes one more time 
 Let the night take you softly into sleep 
 And on to your maker you will fly 
 Low as the angels sing you a lullaby

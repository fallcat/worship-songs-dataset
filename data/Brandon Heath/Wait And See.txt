I was born in Tennessee 
 Late July humidity 
 Doctor said I was lucky to be alive 
 I've been trouble since the day that I got here 
 Trouble till the day that I disappear 
 That'll be the day that I finally get it right 
 There is hope for me yet 
 Because God won't forget 
 All the plans he's made for me 
 I have to wait and see 
 He's not finished with me yet 
 I never really was that good in school 
 I talked too much, broke the rules 
 Teacher thought I was hopeless fool all right 
 I don't know how but I made it through 
 It's one of those things that you've gotta do 
 But I always had a knack for telling the truth 
 Still wondering why I'm here 
 Still wrestling with my fear 
 But oh, He's up to something 
 And the farther on I go 
 I've seen enough to know 
 That I'm, not here for nothing 
 He's up to something 
 So now's my time to be a man 
 Follow my heart as far as I can 
 No telling where I'm ending up tonight 
 I never slow down or so it seems 
 But singing my heart it's one of my dreams 
 All I gotta do is hold on tight

There by the water side 
 I kissed the neighbor girl and made her cry 
 So I grabbed a rope there hanging from a tree 
 And swung myself right in 
 Damp in the summer night 
 I hid behind the tracks of our old train 
 I held on every breath until it came 
 And screamed into the sky 
 Life in the Country 
 Sweet memory 
 The simple kid far from the city 
 Is still the best of me 
 Way on down the dusty road 
 Spinning Red and white is a barber sign 
 Where old man Junis he would spit and shine 
 For a nickel to his name 
 Life in the Country 
 Sweet memory 
 The simple kid far from the city 
 Is still the best of me 
 Bright cast the wooden wall 
 Around the church where Sunday bells would ring 
 The second pew is where I learned to sing 
 Jesus loves me still 
 Life in the Country 
 Sweet memory 
 The simple kid far from the city 
 Is still the best of me

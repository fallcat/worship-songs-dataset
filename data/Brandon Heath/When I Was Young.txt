When I was young 
 I rode my big wheel 
 Down a big hill 
 No helmet on 
 When I was young 
 I found a baby bird 
 With no mother 
 I took it in 
 When I was young 
 When I was young 
 Thought I could breakdance 
 In my parachute pants 
 I was so cool 
 When I was young 
 I had no money 
 Never went hungry 
 Thank you, Mom 
 As we go through the years 
 Somehow those little fears 
 Grow into something else 
 Our older wiser selves 
 So now I play it safe 
 Oh, me of little faith 
 Could learn a thing or two 
 From who I used to be 
 When I was young 
 When I was young 
 I had no regrets 
 No big secrets 
 Except for one 
 I liked a girl 
 I never told her 
 She was older and popular 
 As we go through the years 
 Somehow those little fears 
 Grow into something else 
 Our complicated selves 
 So now I play it safe 
 Oh, me of little faith 
 Could learn a thing or two 
 From who I used to be 
 When I was young 
 Each night I'd say my prayers 
 And He was there 
 I slept so well 
 When I was young 
 When I was young 
 When I was young 
 When I was young

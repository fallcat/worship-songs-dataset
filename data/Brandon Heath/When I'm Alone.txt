When I'm alone 
 The faces they come and they go 
 They all say that I haven't changed 
 I wish I could stay 
 But be where you are 
 The countrys and citys so far 
 This is my job and my gift 
 But sometimes I get 
 Scared 
 That somehow I'll cease to belong 
 Anywhere 
 So I need you when it all starts to show 
 When I'm alone 
 When I'm alone 
 I sleep late it's crazy I know 
 The worlds only passing me by 
 I guess that is why 
 I'm telling you now 
 That I haven't figured it out 
 The depth of the things that I've missed 
 They leave me like this 
 Scared 
 That somehow I'll cease to belong 
 Anywhere 
 So I need you when it all starts to show 
 When I'm alone 
 Is it true that you can find me anytime 
 'Cause I'm feeling like I'm there, it's about that time 
 And I'm scared 
 That somehow I'll cease to belong 
 Anywhere 
 So I need you when it all starts to show 
 When I'm alone

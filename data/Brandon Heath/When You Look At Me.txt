To be known from the inside out 
 What's under the hood, the bad or the good 
 To be known 
 To be found in my hiding place 
 And be received, I'm so relieved 
 To be found 
 There's no shame 
 I'm not the same when You look at me 
 I'm just now finding out what it really means 
 It's like I'm barefoot running through a golden field 
 Like a child that's how You make me feel 
 Oh, Lord 
 When You look at me 
 It's like I'm 12 feet tall without a care 
 Your forgiveness feels like floating on air 
 Oh, Lord 
 When You look at me 
 To be loved like I've never loved 
 So complete, You want me 
 To be loved 
 There's no shame, not the same, oh, God 
 When You look at me 
 I come alive inside, oh, God 
 When You look at me 
 You heal my heart, every scar, oh, God 
 When You look at me 
 No scars 
 When You look at me 
 No shame 
 When You look at me 
 I am loved 
 When You look at me 
 It's like the weight of the world falls off of me 
 And I can just be who You made me to be 
 Oh, Lord 
 When You look at me 
 When You look at me

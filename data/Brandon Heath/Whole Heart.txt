Well I called Your name a long time ago 
 And You sprung a well from a heart of stone 
 But I was careful then what I let You see 
 Only thought You wanted the best of me 
 The less I trust You the less I grow 
 The more You love me the more I know 
 I don't have to be afraid to show 
 All of me, all of me 
 Where there's hurting 
 You show me what healing can do 
 Where there's hatred 
 You show me how kindness can move 
 Where there's fear deep inside 
 I won't run, I won't hide 
 I'll give You all of me 
 So that You can see 
 Every broken piece 
 And open up my whole heart, whole heart 
 And love You with my whole heart, whole heart 
 My whole heart 
 So I'm ready now gonna let You in 
 All the way to the scars beneath my skin 
 And You don't look away cause You understand 
 And You hold my heart with a gentle hand 
 The less I trust You the less I grow 
 The more You love me the more I know 
 I don't have to be afraid to show 
 All of me, all of me 
 Where there's hurting 
 Oh where there's sorrow and shame 
 Enter into the pain

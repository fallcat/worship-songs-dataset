It's up to you, you make the call 
 It's always been your choice 
 Maybe your right 
 And were all wrong 
 Were only some voices 
 Cause in the end it all depends 
 I'll step aside and let you decide 
 There was a season in your life 
 When everyone was smarter 
 The best Advice that they could give 
 You'll have to work much harder 
 Then finally someday you'll be wise 
 Realize only you decide 
 Cause everybody has to choose 
 Sink or swim win or lose 
 No not everybody gets it right 
 Fight or flight, so will you 
 Decide 
 So you bent the rules 
 Denied the truth 
 And all the strong suggestions 
 You never heard 
 Your parents say 
 They're giant misperceptions 
 Of who you really are, you've come this far 
 Here you are, you decide 
 Cause' everybody has to choose sink or swim win or lose 
 Know everybody gets it right fight or flight so will you decide 
 Make your move 
 It's up to you 
 Don't let the moment pass you by 
 All eyes on you 
 Whatcha gonna do 
 With all the swirling through your head 
 You've got to use your heart instead 
 No not everybody gets it right fight or flight so will you decide 
 Cause' everybody has to choose sink or swim win or lose 
 Know that everybody gets it right fight or flight so will you decide 
 You decide

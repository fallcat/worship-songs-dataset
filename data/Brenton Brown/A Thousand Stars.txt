I have a dream that I will be someone 
 You can call on when the darkness falls 
 That I will be strong for You 
 I have a dream that You will see me 
 Shining brightly like a thousand stars 
 But I will go far for You 
 I may seem small, with no hope at all 
 But this heart of mine still dares to dream 
 May love come by this hold on life 
 But I'm still hopeful for so many things 
 'Cause I'm standing tall and I am 
 On Your shoulders 
 The stars don't seem so far at all 
 With You, it seems I could be 
 Someone who one day might be there for You too 
 I have a dream that I'll be a teacher 
 Maybe a husband, and a father too 
 I dream for two 
 And one day maybe I will be famous 
 You'll see my name where the heroes lie 
 I can only try for You 
 I may seem small, with no hope at all 
 But this heart of mine still dares to dream 
 May love come by this hold on life 
 But I'm still hopeful for so many things 
 'Cause I'm standing tall and I am 
 On Your shoulders 
 The stars don't seem so far at all 
 With You, it seems I could be 
 Someone who one day might be there for You too 
 I am a dreamer 
 Help me be there for You, Lord 
 Let me be there for You 
 I wanna be there for You 
 I wanna be there for You 
 I'm standing tall and I am 
 On Your shoulders 
 The stars don't seem so far at all 
 With You, it seems I could be 
 Someone who one day might be there for You too

We bow our hearts, we lift our hands 
 We turn our eyes to you again 
 And we surrender to the truth 
 That all we need is found in You 
 Receive our adoration Jesus lamb of God 
 Receive our adoration, how wonderful you are 
 We choose to leave it all behind 
 And turn our eyes towards the prize 
 The upward call of God in Christ 
 You have our hearts, Lord take our lives 
 Receive our adoration Jesus lamb of God 
 Receive our adoration how wonderful you are 
 Every soul you've saved sings out 
 Everything you've made resounds 
 All creation's standing now 
 Lifting up your name 
 We're we're joining in the angel's song 
 We're gathered to your ancient throne 
 Children in our Father's arms 
 Shouting out your praise

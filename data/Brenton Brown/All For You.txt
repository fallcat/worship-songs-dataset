Savior all these songs we sing, every word and melody 
 All of it is meant for You alone 
 Silent prayers and bended knees, every kind of offering 
 All of it's intended for Your throne 
 Jesus this is all for You, Father this is all for You 
 How Your children long to bless Your heart 
 Lord we've tasted and we've seen, beheld the beauty of the King 
 And we long to magnify our God 
 Every lifted voice and hand, every woman, every man 
 All of us have known Your generous ways 
 Cause Spirit you have carried us, we have seen Your faithfulness 
 And our hearts are bursting with Your praise 
 Jesus this is all for You, Father this is all for You 
 How Your children long to bless Your heart 
 Lord we've tasted and we've seen, beheld the beauty of the King 
 And we long to magnify our God 
 It's all for You Lord 
 It's all for You Lord 
 All for You, all for You, all to bless Your heart 
 All for You, all for You, all for You oh God

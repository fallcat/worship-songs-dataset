Forgiveness comes to me though I do not deserve it 
 I barely speak the words and You draw near again 
 It's so hard to believe that I am really worth it 
 That you laid down Your life to carry all my sins 
 What kind of love is this, what kind of love is this? 
 That we are called children of God? 
 All I've got, all I want is in You, it's in You 
 Like the air in my lungs I will breathe You in 
 All I want, all I need is Your grace and Your truth 
 Fill me up, fill me up, let me sing again, yeah 
 Father without Your flame, my life is lived in darkness 
 I know I need You now, I'm reaching for Your hand 
 Without Your mercy Lord, there'd be no second chances 
 But You reach for Your child, and lift me up again 
 What kind of love is this, what kind of love is this? 
 That we are called children of God? 
 All I've got, all I want is in You, it's in You 
 Like the air in my lungs I will breathe You in 
 All I want, all I need is Your grace and Your truth 
 Fill me up, fill me up, let me sing again, 
 Let me sing again, 
 I will sing again, let me sing again, 
 All I've got, all I want is in You, it's in You 
 Like the air in my lungs I will breathe You in 
 All I want, all I need is Your grace and Your truth 
 Fill me up, fill me up, let me sing again, 
 All I've got, all I want is in You, it's in You 
 Like the air in my lungs I will breathe You in 
 All I want, all I need is Your grace and Your truth 
 Fill me up, fill me up, let me sing again, yeah 
 I wanna live for You, I wanna live for You 
 In Your grace, in Your ways, I wanna live for You 
 I wanna live for You

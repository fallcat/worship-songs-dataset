We can hear it growing louder 
 Songs from every nation 
 Rising to your throne 
 Saints in every generation 
 Singing for your glory 
 Telling what you've done 
 From the north and south, we are crying out 
 There is hope in Jesus' name 
 You're amazing God, You're amazing God 
 You can bear the weight of every heavy heart 
 You can heal the pain, you can clean the stain 
 You can turn our tears into songs of praise 
 You're amazing God 
 Beauty rises from the ashes 
 Sorrow turns to gladness 
 When our God is near 
 You speak light into our darkness 
 You heal the broken-hearted 
 You wipe away our tears 
 Songs of praise surround us, songs of praise surround us 
 Hear it growing louder, we are growing louder

There is a King, a risen King 
 Radiant, He reigns in majesty 
 He conquered death, it has no sting 
 And at His word we will rise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Come awake, rise from the ground 
 Open your eyes and see what you have found 
 Come awake, oh you who sleep 
 Search no more, for He is all we need 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 There is not one, there is not one, who is so beautiful 
 (x2) 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise, we will arise and sing 
 Arise and sing 
 Arise and sing

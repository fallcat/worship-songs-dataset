As we come into your presence we remember every blessing 
 That you've poured out so freely from above 
 Lifting gratitude and praises for compassion so amazing 
 Lord we've come to give you thanks for all you've done 
 Because of Your love we're forgiven 
 Because of Your love our hearts are clean 
 We lift you up with songs of freedom 
 Forever we're changed because of your love 
 You're the one who has given us freedom 
 You're the one who is making us new 
 You're the one who is bringing us healing 
 We owe it all to you

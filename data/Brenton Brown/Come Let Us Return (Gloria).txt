Come let us return to the Lord, 
 Come let us return to the Lord 
 Fill this room with sound, let the praise resound 
 Come let us return to the Lord 
 Gloria, gloria, Lord our eyes are fixed upon you 
 Gloria, gloria, turn our hearts to you again 
 Welcomed to the table of the King, 
 Welcomed to the table of the King 
 Homeless and ashamed, the Saviour called our names 
 We've been welcomed to the table of the king 
 Gloria, gloria, Lord our eyes are fixed upon you 
 Gloria, gloria, turn our hearts to you again 
 Look what you've done, look what you've done 
 All that we have is yours alone 
 What can we give, what can we bring 
 You deserve more than the songs that we sing 
 Let mercy rise like praise to your throne, 
 Let mercy rise like praise to you throne 
 Father touch your church, 'til justice fills the earth 
 Let mercy rise like praise to your throne 
 Gloria, gloria, Lord our eyes are fixed upon you 
 Gloria, gloria, turn our hearts to you again

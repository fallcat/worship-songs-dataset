When my heart is overwhelmed 
 I will look to you alone 
 God my rock, god my rock, god my rock 
 You will stand when others fall 
 You are faithful through it all 
 God my rock, god my rock, god my rock 
 In the blessing, in the pain 
 Through it all you've never failed me 
 You are the strength of my heart 
 You are the strength of my heart 
 I can rely on you, I can rely on you 
 You are the joy of my life 
 You are my song in the night 
 There is no one as true 
 Jesus I trust in you 
 When I've struggled to believe 
 You have not let go of me 
 God my rock, god my rock, god my rock 
 Carried through the darkest storms 
 You have held me in your arms 
 God my rock god my rock god my rock

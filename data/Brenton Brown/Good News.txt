For God loved this world so much that He gave His only Son 
 That whoever would believe in Him 
 Would not perish but be saved, oh how surprising is His grace, 
 The invitation is for everyone 
 For everyone, for everyone, yeah 
 This is the good news, it's a hope that is true 
 Lord we sing 'cause we've found peace on earth 
 Jesus did not come to condemn but that we might live again 
 His Holy mission was to rescue us 
 For long before we cried for help He took our sins upon Himself 
 He took our shame and gave us righteousness 
 His righteousness, we are His righteousness, yeah 
 This is the good news, it's a hope that is true 
 Lord we sing 'cause we've found peace on earth 
 And death cannot shake us, our sins have been taken 
 Alive, we're alive and we'll sing Your worth 
 Take these words and make them louder 
 Take these words and make them louder 
 Take these words and make them louder Lord 
 Take these words and make them louder 
 Take these words and make them louder 
 Take these words and make them louder 
 Make them louder, make them louder... 
 We'll sing louder, we'll sing louder 
 This is the good news, it's a hope that is true 
 Lord we sing 'cause we've found peace on earth 
 And death cannot shake us, our sins have been taken 
 Alive, we're alive and we'll sing Your worth

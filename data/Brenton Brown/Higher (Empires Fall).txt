Empires fall, but You're still standing, 
 You were there from the beginning 
 And You'll be there when this life on earth is done 
 Kings and kingdoms will be shaken, shooting stars, each one is fading 
 Jesus You're still shining brighter than the sun 
 You are higher, You are higher than all rulers, than all powers 
 Rock of ages You're the hope that remains 
 You're the treasure that's worth seeking, in Your presence there is healing 
 Jesus when You speak You set our hearts aflame 
 So be the first one that we run to, be the rock that we hold on to 
 Turn our hearts to seek Your kingdom and Your fame 
 You are higher, You are higher than all rulers, than all powers 
 Rock of ages You're the hope that remains 
 The beginning and the ending, everlasting, never ending 
 Jesus we're held in Your hands 
 You are the fortress that will not be shaken, 
 You are the strength of our hearts 
 You are our rock, You're the hope of this nation, 
 And we will trust in You God 
 You are higher, You are higher than all rulers, than all powers 
 Rock of ages You're the hope that remains 
 The beginning and the ending, everlasting, never ending 
 Jesus we're held in Your hands 
 Jesus we're held in Your hands 
 We're held in Your hands 
 We're held in Your hands 
 Jesus we're held in Your hands 
 Held in Your hands 
 Held in Your hands

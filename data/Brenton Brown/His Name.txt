Who is this king of glory, maker of all the heavens? 
 Author of all creation, what is his name? 
 Who is the one who formed us, made us into his image? 
 At who's voice will all of heaven one day bow in praise? 
 His name is wonderful, his name is counselor 
 His name is prince of peace, the living word 
 His name is mighty god, eternal father 
 His name is Jesus, his name is lord 
 Who is this king of glory, born to the virgin mary? 
 Who's simple words could raise the dead and heal the lame? 
 He gave his life for many, was crucified and buried 
 But on the third day he rose up from the grave 
 Ransomed for my release, he came to set me free 
 Oh, how amazing is my savior's love for me!

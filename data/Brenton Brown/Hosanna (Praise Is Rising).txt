Everlasting God album version: 
 Praise is rising, eyes are turning to You 
 We turn to You 
 Hope is stirring, hearts are yearning for You 
 We long for You 
 'Cause when we see You, we find strength to face the day 
 In Your presence all our fears are washed away, washed away 
 Hosanna, Hosanna 
 You are the God who saves us 
 Worthy of all our praises 
 Hear the sound of hearts returning to You 
 We turn to You 
 In Your kingdom broken lives are made new 
 You make all things new 
 When we see You, we find strength to face the day 
 In Your presence all our fears are washed away, washed away 
 Hosanna, Hosanna 
 You are the God who saves us 
 Worthy of all our praises 
 Hosanna, Hosanna 
 Come have Your way among us 
 We welcome You here, Lord Jesus 
 Yeah 
 Hosanna, Hosanna 
 You are the God who saves us 
 Worthy of all our praises 
 Hosanna, Hosanna 
 Come have Your way among us 
 We welcome You here, Lord Jesus 
 Yeah, You are the God who saves us 
 You are the God who saves us 
 Worthy of all our praises 
 You are the God who saves us

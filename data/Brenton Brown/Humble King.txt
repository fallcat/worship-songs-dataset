Oh kneel me down a-gain 
 Here at Your feet 
 Show me how much You love humility 
 Oh Spirit be the star that leads me to 
 The humble heart of love I see in You 
 You are the God of the broken 
 The friend of the weak 
 You wash the feet of the weary 
 Embrace the ones in need 
 I want to be like You, Jesus 
 To have this heart in me 
 You are the God of the humble 
 You are the humble King

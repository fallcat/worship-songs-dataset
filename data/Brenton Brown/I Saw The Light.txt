I've wandered so aimless, life filled with sin. 
 I wouldn't let my dear Savior in. 
 Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light. 
 I saw the light, I saw the light. 
 No more darkness no more night. 
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light. 
 I've walked in darkness, clouds covered me. 
 I had no idea where the way out could be. 
 Then came the sunrise and rolled back the night. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light. 
 Just like a blind man I wandered alone. 
 Worries and fears I claimed for my own. 
 Then, like a blind man who God gave back his sight, 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light. 
 When death takes me down and I breathe here no more, 
 My anthem will sound on that eternal shore. 
 When I join with the angels in heaven on high 
 Singing, "Praise the Lord, I saw the light"

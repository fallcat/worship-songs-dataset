I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I will not forget all Your benefits 
 Even when the storm surrounds my soul 
 How You comfort me, heal all my diseases 
 How You lift me up on eagle's wings 
 I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I will not forget all Your benefits 
 How You've chosen and adopted me 
 Orphaned by my sin Your grace has let me in 
 And never once have You abandoned me, no, no 
 I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I have tasted and I've seen how You Father faithfully 
 How You shepherd those who fear Your name 
 When the shadow's start to fall and my heart begins to fail 
 I will lift my eyes to You again and.. 
 I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I will remember You, always remember You, Lord 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me 
 I will remember You, always remember You 
 I will remember You and all You've done for me, yeah 
 All You've done for me, yeah

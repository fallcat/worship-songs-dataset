Jesus we come to Your table, we take Your body and blood 
 This is Your invitation, a reminder of love 
 Jesus we come to remember the life You gave us 
 Every sin is defeated by Your death on the cross 
 Jesus Christ You satisfy 
 Our living stream, the Bread of Life 
 Jesus Christ more than I need 
 The Lamb of God my victory 
 King of kings You laid Your body down 
 Oh what love that lets the lost be found 
 Oh what sacrifice given for my gain 
 All who die in You will rise again 
 King of kings forsaken for my sin 
 Lamb of God and yet the Lion wins 
 Lifted high for all the world to see 
 Jesus my victory

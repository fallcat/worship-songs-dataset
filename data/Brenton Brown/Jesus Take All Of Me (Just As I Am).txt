Just as I am without one plea 
 But that Thy blood was shed for me 
 And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee 
 O Lamb of God I come I come 
 Just as I am though tossed about 
 With all my conflict all my doubt 
 Fightings and fears within without 
 Oh Lamb of God I come I come 
 Jesus take all of me 
 I run to You I run to You 
 I lay everything at Your feet 
 Let my life be Yours 
 Just as I am Thou wilt receive 
 Wilt welcome pardon cleanse relieve 
 Because Thy promises I believe 
 O Lamb of God I come I come 
 Just as I am Thy love unknown 
 Has broken every barrier down 
 Now to be Thine yes Thine alone 
 O Lamb of God I come I come

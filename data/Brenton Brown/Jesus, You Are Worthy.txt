Jesus, You are mercy, Jesus, You are justice 
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what You are 
 You died alone to save me, You rose so You could raise me 
 You did this all to make me a chosen child of God 
 Worthy is the Lamb that once was slain 
 To receive all glory, power and praise 
 For with Your blood You purchased us for God 
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what You are 
 Jesus, You are mercy, Jesus, You are justice 
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what You are 
 You died alone to save me, You rose so You could raise me 
 You did this all to make me a chosen child of God 
 Worthy is the Lamb that once was slain 
 To receive all glory, power and praise 
 For with Your blood You purchased us for God 
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what You are 
 Perfect sacrifice crushed by God for us 
 Bearing in Your hurt all that I deserve 
 Misjudged for my misdeeds You suffered silently 
 The only guiltless man in all of history 
 Worthy is the Lamb that once was slain 
 To receive all glory, power and praise 
 For with Your blood You purchased us for God 
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what You are 
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what You are

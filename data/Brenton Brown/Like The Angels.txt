When I am sinking down, when I am lost at sea 
 No solace to be found, no ground beneath my feet 
 I turn to You as I go down, I reach for You through roaring waves 
 My only hope is in Your arms, my only prayer is that You'd save me 
 'Cause You make me soar like the angels 
 You let me walk on the water 
 And You let me run with white horses 
 Jesus, my strength when all is gone 
 When I am all alone, no land is in my sight 
 All others lost from view, and comes the darkening night 
 I reach for You as I go down, I look to You through roaring waves 
 My only hope is in Your arms, my only prayer is that You'd save me 
 Save me 
 'Cause You make me soar like the angels 
 You let me walk on the water 
 And You let me run with white horses 
 Jesus, my strength when all is gone 
 You make me soar like the angels 
 You let me walk on the water 
 And You let me run with white horses 
 Jesus, my strength when all is gone 
 Jesus, my strength when all is gone 
 You are my strength when all is gone 
 You are my strength 
 You are my strength 
 You are my

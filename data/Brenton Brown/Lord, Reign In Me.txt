WoW Worship Green Version: 
 Over all the earth, You reign on high 
 Every mountain stream every sunset sky 
 But my one request Lord, my only aim 
 Is that You'd reign in me again 
 Lord reign in me reign in Your power 
 Over all my dreams in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again 
 Over every thought over every word 
 May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord 
 'Cause You mean more to me than any earthly thing 
 So won't You reign in me again 
 Lord reign in me reign in Your power 
 Over all my dreams in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again 
 Over all the earth, You reign on high 
 Every mountain stream every sunset sky 
 But my one request Lord, my only aim 
 Is that You'd reign in me again 
 Lord reign in me reign in Your power 
 Over all my dreams in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again 
 Lord reign in me reign in Your power 
 Over all my dreams in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again 
 Won't You reign 
 Won't You reign in me again 
 Come and reign, Lord 
 Won't You reign in me again 
 Yeah.. 
 Hmmm... 
 Yeahâ€¦

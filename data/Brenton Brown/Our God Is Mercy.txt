Our God is mercy, our God is mercy 
 If your heart is heavy, if your soul is thirsty 
 There is a refuge, a home for the lonely 
 Cause our God is near, our God is near 
 Our God is near, our God is near 
 (x2) 
 The kingdom of our God is near 
 Lift your eyes, lift your eyes 
 The hope of Heaven's drawing near 
 Lift your eyes, lift your eyes 
 You're blessed if you've been torn apart 
 You're blessed if you've a broken heart 
 Cause hope is waiting at the door 
 Salvation's near 
 Cause our God is mercy, our God is mercy 
 If your heart is heavy, if your soul is thirsty 
 There is a refuge, a home for the lonely 
 Cause our God is near, our God is near 
 Our God is near, our God is near 
 Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes 
 Lift up your eyes and sing 
 (x4) 
 Cause our God is mercy, our God is mercy 
 If your heart is heavy, if your soul is thirsty 
 There is a refuge, a home for the lonely 
 Cause our God is near, our God is near 
 Our God is near, our God is near 
 Our God is near, our God is near

In the name of the father, in the name of the Son 
 In the name of the Spirit, Lord we come 
 Gathered together to lift up your name 
 To call on our Savior, to fall on Your grace. 
 Hear the joyful sound of our offering 
 As Your saints bow down, as Your people sing 
 We will rise with You, lifted on Your wings 
 And the world will see that... 
 Our God saves, our god saves 
 There is hope, in Your name, Jesus 
 In the name of the father, in the name of the Son 
 In the name of the Spirit, Lord we come 
 Gathered together to lift up your name 
 To call on our Savior, to fall on Your grace. 
 Hear the joyful sound of our offering 
 As Your saints bow down, as Your people sing 
 We will rise with You, lifted on Your wings 
 And the world will see that... 
 Our God saves, our god saves 
 There is hope, in Your name 
 Mourning turns to songs of praise 
 Our God saves, our God saves 
 Hear the joyful sound of our offering 
 As Your saints bow down, as Your people sing 
 We will rise with You, lifted on Your wings 
 And the world will see that... 
 And the world will see that... 
 And the world will see that... 
 Our God saves, our god saves 
 There is hope, in Your name, Jesus 
 Mourning turns to songs of praise 
 Our God saves, our God saves

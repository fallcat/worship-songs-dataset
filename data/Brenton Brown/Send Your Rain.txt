Send your rain, send your rain 
 Let your healing fall on our hearts again 
 We are dry, we're crying out 
 Savior send the streams that will break the drought 
 Send your rain 
 Generous God you pour out 
 Tender mercies on Your children 
 In your grace hear us now, 
 Send Your rain, send your rain

So much love, so much light, I'm alive again 
 My first breath, gazing into You 
 Open eyes, I can see You've been calling me 
 This is who I was meant to be (and I'm) 
 So alive, so alive, living in this love divine 
 I'm So amazed, so amazed at You 
 Moved from dark to blazing light 
 Your love took me by surprise 
 Now I never want to live away from You 
 I don't ever want to live away from You 
 Hey yeah…. 
 Breathing out, breathing in, so revived in this love 
 So content, so dependent on You 
 Just a child but I'm Yours, what a mystery that You 
 The God of all would make me Your own 
 And I'm alive, so alive, living in this love divine 
 I'm So amazed, so amazed at You 
 Moved from dark to blazing light 
 Your love took me by surprise 
 Now I never want to live away from You 
 I don't ever want to live away from You 
 Hey yeah…. 
 So alive, so alive, living in this love, living in this love divine 
 (You changed my life, You saved my life 
 You put Your love so deep inside 
 You turned things round, You set things right 
 I'm dancing in this love I've found) 
 And I'm alive, so alive, living in this love divine 
 I'm So amazed, so amazed at You 
 I'm moved from dark to blazing light 
 Where Your love took me by surprise 
 Now I never want to live away from You 
 No, I never want to live away from You 
 I don't ever want to live away from You 
 Hey yeah…. 
 (You've changed my life, You've saved my life, You've changed my life)

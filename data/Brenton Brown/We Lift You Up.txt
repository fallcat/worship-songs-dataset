Jesus you are strong to save 
 There's no battle you can't win 
 Stronger even than the grave 
 We turn to you again (and) 
 We lift you up, we lift you higher 
 You deserve our highest praise 
 We'll sing it out, we'll sing it louder 
 Jesus name above all names 
 Only you have overcome 
 Every trial this world can bring 
 Humbly you defeated sin 
 Then died that we might live 
 You conquered temptation, obedient to death 
 You won our salvation, You are our righteousness

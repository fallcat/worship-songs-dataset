We need You, how we need You 
 We need You every hour 
 To see You in Your glory 
 To know Your spirit's power 
 There's healing in Your presence 
 There's mercy where You are 
 So meet us, won't You meet us 
 Living God 
 No other God but You 
 No other God but You 
 No other God can satisfy 
 You are our great reward 
 It's You we're longing for 
 No other God but You most High 
 Each trial and each temptation 
 Each enemy we fear 
 Retreats in resignation 
 When the living God is near 
 So we kneel again before You 
 O keeper of our hearts 
 And we ask for your deliverance 
 Living God 
 No other God but You 
 No other God but You 
 No other God can satisfy 
 You are our great reward 
 It's You we're longing for 
 No other God but You most High 
 We are leaning on Your everlasting arms 
 Lord we know You'll see us through 
 Great redeemer, be the song within our hearts 
 We'll have no other God but You 
 One day we'll stand before You 
 When all our sufferings cease 
 And faced with all Your glory 
 We'll meet the Prince of peace 
 But Jesus in that moment 
 When every trial has passed 
 We will need You, still we'll need You 
 Living God 
 No other God but You 
 No other God but You 
 No other God can satisfy 
 You are our great reward 
 It's You we're longing for 
 No other God but You most High

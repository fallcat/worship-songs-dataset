Just like the ones who came before us 
 Just like the ones who gave their lives 
 Lord, we will leave this place with You 
 And we will go, and we will go 
 Just as You came to earth from heaven 
 Humbled Yourself to give Your life 
 We want to follow and obey You 
 So we will go, we will go 
 Light of the world, You've shone on us 
 You've filled our hearts with hope that reaches out 
 Friend of the lost, Saviour to me 
 Make me a flame, set me on fire to be 
 A light in the world 
 Set us on fire 
 Just as they prayed to You for power 
 That they'd be bold to speak Your word 
 Father, we ask that You would fill us as we go, as we go 
 Just as they asked You for salvation 
 Just as they prayed for kingdom signs 
 Lord, would You send us with Your Spirit as we go, as we go 
 We wanna go 
 Light of the world, You've shone on us 
 You've filled our hearts with hope that reaches out 
 Friend of the lost, come burn in me 
 Make me a flame, set me on fire to be 
 A light in the world 
 Set me on fire 
 Set me on fire 
 Set me on fire 
 Set me on fire 
 Set me on fire, Lord make me a flame 
 Release revival, please do it again... 
 Won't You Set me on fire, Lord make me a flame 
 Release revival, please do it again... 
 Won't You Set me on fire, Lord make me a flame 
 Release revival, please do it again... 
 Won't You Set me on fire, Lord make me a flame 
 Release revival, please do it again... 
 Do it againâ€¦. 
 Light of the world, You've shone on us 
 You've filled our hearts with hope that reaches out 
 Friend of the lost, come burn in me 
 Make me a flame, set me on fire to be 
 A light in the world 
 Oh, burn in me 
 Make me a flame, set me on fire to be 
 A light in the world

 Spoken: 
 God, I just pray You'd bless this time of worship 
 Lord, that You'd be glorified and 
 Lord, that we would meet You 
 And uh,  Lord, that our songs would touch Your heart.  Amen.  Amen. 
 Okay.  You got the guitar, I thought you were leading worship.

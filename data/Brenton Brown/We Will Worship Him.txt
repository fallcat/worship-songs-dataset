Let us come together, let us join as one 
 Let us turn our faces to the rising Son 
 Let us go up to Zion to God's holy hill 
 A mighty army that will worship Him 
 We will worship Him, we will worship Him 
 Jesus, He's our King, we will worship Him 
 Let the oceans roar, let the heaven's ring 
 To the glory of our God as we worship Him 
 It is time for battle, it's time for war 
 As we sing Hosanna, as we praise the Lord 
 He will still the accuser, crush the enemy 
 As we celebrate God's victory 
 We will worship Him, we will worship Him 
 Jesus, He's our King, we will worship Him 
 Let the oceans roar, let the heaven's ring 
 To the glory of our God as we worship Him 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 We will worship Him, we will worship Him 
 Jesus, He's our King, we will worship Him 
 Let the oceans roar, let the heaven's ring 
 To the glory of our God as we worship Him 
 We worship You, Lord 
 Worship Him 
 Worship Him 
 Hey 
 Worship Him 
 Worship Him 
 Worship Him 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi, Jesu Inkosi 
 Amen

 Hallelujah

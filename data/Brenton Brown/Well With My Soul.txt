Sometimes it's hard, sometimes I cry 
 Sometimes my heart wants to know why? 
 But Your yoke is easy and Your burden is light 
 And though my heart is aching and there're tears in my eyes 
 Whatever my lot, You have taught me to know 
 It is well, it is well with my soul 
 Well with my soul 
 It's not always easy, I'm not always right 
 Sometimes I do things that are wrong in Your sight 
 But I have decided I'm going to follow Jesus 
 And there's no turning back, there's no turning back, no 
 Whatever my lot, You have taught me to know 
 It is well, it is well with my soul 
 Well with my soul 
 'Cause You have reached down to me, You have rescued me 
 You have shed Your blood for my soul 
 And I live now knowing that the sky and not the grave will be my goal 
 And just as in life, also in death this truth will comfort and console 
 That soon I will see Your face and will hear Your voice and I will know that it is wellâ€¦ 
 Whatever my lot, You have taught me to know 
 It is well, it is well with my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 When the hard times come 
 I will lift my hands 
 I will sing Your name 
 I will shout Your praise 
 'Cause it is well with my soul 
 But please hold my hand, Lord, and hold on tight 
 'Cause the road here is narrow 
 Yeah, the road here is narrow

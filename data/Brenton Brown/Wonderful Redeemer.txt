You, You, You have won my heart 
 I'm so glad You found me 
 Jesus where would I be without 
 You, You, You, broke my chains 
 You welcomed me to freedom 
 My wonderful redeemer 
 So take it all, not just a part 
 I want to love with my whole heart 
 'Cause I was dead, now I'm alive 
 I want to trust You with my life 
 Simple words sometimes are not enough 
 To tell the goodness of Your love 
 Sometimes I have to sing Your praises 
 Oh the depths that You have gone for me 
 The gates of hell, the sinners tree 
 Jesus Your love is so amazing

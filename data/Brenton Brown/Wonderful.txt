We need you, how we need you, we need you every hour 
 To know you in your glory, to see your spirit's power 
 There's healing in your presence, there's mercy where you are 
 So meet us, won't you meet us Living God 
 No other God but you, no other God but you 
 No other God can satisfy 
 You are our great reward, it's You we're longing for 
 No other God but you most High 
 Each trial and each temptation, each enemy we fear 
 Retreats in resignation when the living God is near 
 So we kneel again before you, o keeper of our hearts 
 And we ask for your deliverance living God 
 We are leaning on your everlasting arms 
 Lord we know you'll see us through 
 Great redeemer, be the song within our hearts 
 We'll have no other God but you... 
 One day we'll stand before you, when all our sufferings cease 
 And faced with all your glory, we'll meet the Prince of peace 
 But Jesus in that moment, when every trial has passed 
 We'll need you, still we'll need you living God 
 We are leaning on your everlasting arms 
 Lord we know you'll see us through 
 Great redeemer, be the song within our hearts 
 We'll have no other God but you...

The Word of God is 
 Light in my darkness 
 Hope for the hopeless, strong and true 
 The Word of God is 
 Strength for the weary 
 A shield for those who trust in You 
 A shield for those who trust in You 
 Everything will fade 
 Everything will fade 
 The heavens and the earth will pass away 
 But You will remain 
 Jesus, faithful Word of God 
 The anchor of my heart 
 You're everything You say You are 
 Oh, greater than my deepest need 
 The ground beneath my feet 
 Your promises won't fail me now 
 You will not fail us 
 You will not fail us 
 You will not fail us 
 Oh, Word of God 
 You will not fail us 
 You will not fail us 
 You will not fail us 
 Oh, Word of God

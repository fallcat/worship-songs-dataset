Like a whisper, like a love song 
 I can hear Your voice, I can hear Your voice 
 Like a father to his new born 
 I can hear Your voice calling me 
 You are my child, you are my child and I love you 
 You are my child, you are my child and I love you 
 Like a promise, like a thank You 
 I will sing this song, I will sing this song 
 For the way You make my heart new 
 I will sing this song to You 
 You are my God, You are my God and I love You 
 You are my God, You are my God and I love You 
 There is no higher call, there's no greater reward 
 Than to know You, God, to be known as Yours 
 There is no better goal, nothing I'm longing for 
 Can compare with the truth that forever more 
 You are my God, You are my God and I love You 
 You are my God, You are my God and I love You 
 How I love You 
 How I love You 
 Oh, Lord 
 Oh, Lord 
 There is no higher call, there's no greater reward 
 Than to know You, God, to be known as Yours 
 There is no better goal, nothing I'm longing for 
 Can compare with the truth that forever more 
 You are my God, You are my God and I love You 
 You are my God, You are my God and I love You 
 Yes, I love You

Surrender 
 Abandon 
 I'm yielding all of me to You 
 Resistance 
 It's over 
 Come invade my heart 
 Fill my every thought with You 
 Take this living sacrifice 
 Make me Yours forever 
 Take my heart renew my mind 
 My body now surrendered 
 I will stay 
 Trusting in You I remain 
 Here on the altar of love

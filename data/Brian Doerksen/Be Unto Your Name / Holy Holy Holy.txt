We are a moment You are forever Lord of ages God before time 
 We are a vapour You are eternal Love everlasting reigning on high 
 Holy holy Lord God Almighty Worthy is the Lamb who was slain 
 Highest praises honour and glory Be unto Your name 
 Be unto Your name 
 Holy Holy Holy Lord God Almighty 
 Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee 
 Holy Holy Holy Merciful and mighty 
 God in three persons blessed Trinity 
 We are broken You are the healer Jesus Redeemer mighty to save 
 You are the love song we'll sing forever 
 Bowing before You blessing Your name 
 Holy holy Lord God Almighty Worthy is the Lamb who was slain 
 Highest praises honour and glory Be unto Your name 
 Be unto Your name 
 Be unto Your name Be unto Your name Be unto Your name 
 All thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea 
 Holy Holy Holy Merciful and mighty 
 God in three persons blessed Trinity 
 God in three persons blessed Trinity

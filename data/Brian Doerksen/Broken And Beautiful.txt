As we break this bread 
 As we drink this cup 
 Lord we remember 
 How You gave Your life on a brutal cross 
 Lord we remember 
 This is the way You've chosen to say 
 This is the way You make all things new 
 This is the way You've chosen to say 
 This is the way You make all things new 
 Broken and beautiful 
 Extravagant love 
 Prodigal grace 
 Broken and beautiful 
 God's perfect justice 
 Mercies embraced 
 As we break this bread 
 As we drink this cup 
 Lord we remember 
 It was for my sin that Your flesh was torn 
 Lord we remember 
 This is the way You've chosen to say 
 This is the way You make all things new 
 This is the way You've chosen to say 
 This is the way You make all things new 
 Broken and beautiful 
 Extravagant love 
 Prodigal grace 
 Broken and beautiful 
 God's perfect justice 
 Mercies embraced 
 Broken and beautiful 
 Broken and beautiful 
 This is the way You've chosen to say 
 This is the way You make all things new 
 This is the way You've chosen to say 
 This is the way You make all things new 
 As we break this bread 
 As we drink this cup 
 Lord we remember

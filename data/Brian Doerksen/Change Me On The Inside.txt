I long for freedom to live in the truth 
 I want to be more like You 
 But every time I try to bring about change 
 I only touch the visible me 
 There's only one way I'm really gonna change 
 Just like King David, I cry out to You 
 Create in me a clean heart 
 I've grieved You again, I need Your release 
 From patterns that keep me in sin 
 There's only one way I can finally break free 
 Change me on the inside 
 Change me on the inside 
 Change me on the inside 
 Change me on the inside 
 Change me on the inside 
 Change me on the inside

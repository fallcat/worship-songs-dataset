I can feel You flowin' through me. 
 Holy Spirit, com'n' fill me up, 
 Come and fill me up. 
 Love'n' mercy fill my senses. 
 I am thirsty for Your presence, Lord, 
 Come and fill me up. 
 Lord, let Your mercy wash away all of my sin. 
 Fill me completely with Your love once again. 
 I need You, I want You, I love Your Presence. 
 I need You, I want You, I love Your Presence.

Come, now is the time to worship 
 Come, now is the time 
 To give your heart 
 Come, just as you are to worship 
 Come, just as you are 
 Before your God 
 Come 
 One day every 
 Tongue will confess 
 You are God 
 One day every knee will bow 
 Still the greatest treasure 
 Remains for those 
 Who gladly choose You now

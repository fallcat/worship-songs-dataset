I have felt the wind blow, 
 Whispering Your name 
 I have seen Your tears fall 
 When I watch the rain 
 How could I say there is no God 
 When all around creation calls 
 A singing bird, a mighty tree 
 The vast expanse of open sea 
 Gazing at a bird in flight, 
 Soaring through the air 
 Lying down beneath the stars, 
 I feel Your presence there 
 I love to stand at ocean's shore 
 And feel the thundering breakers roar 
 To walk through golden fields of grain 
 'Neath endless blue horizon's frame 
 Listening to a river run, watering the earth 
 Fragrance of a rose in bloom, a newborn's cry at birth 
 I believe, I believe, I believe

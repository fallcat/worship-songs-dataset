Are you tired 
 Worn out and empty 
 Is your soul weary 
 Have you tried 
 Releasing your burdens 
 Do you feel the weight 
 Of worry 
 I am the rest you need 
 I am the Prince of Peace 
 Enter the rest of God 
 Come to Me 
 Burdens will fly away 
 Walk with Me 
 Learn the unforced rhythms of grace 
 Come to Me 
 Burdens will fly away 
 Walk with Me 
 Learn the unforced rhythms 
 Live the unforced rhythms of grace

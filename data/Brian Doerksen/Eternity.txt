I will be Yours 
 You will be mine 
 Together in the eternity 
 Our hearts of love will be entwined 
 Together in the eternity 
 Forever in the eternity 
 I will be Yours 
 You will be mine 
 Together in the eternity 
 Our hearts of love will be entwined 
 Together in the eternity 
 Forever in the eternity 
 No more tears of pain, in you eyes 
 No more fear or shame 
 For we will be with You 
 Yes we will be with You 
 I will be yours, You will be mine 
 Together in the eternity 
 Our hearts of love will be entwined 
 Together in the eternity 
 We will worship 
 We will worship You forever

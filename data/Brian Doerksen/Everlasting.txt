From everlasting to everlasting You are God 
 From everlasting to everlasting You are God 
 In holiness You stand secure 
 Through culture's shifting sands 
 Unchanged by all the vanities of man 
 And as the nations rise and fall 
 Your sovereignty remains 
 You are, You are, You are the one true God 
 From everlasting to everlasting You are God 
 From everlasting to everlasting You are God 
 In faithfulness Your love extends 
 Through times of turbulence 
 Adopting those who call upon Your name 
 And every generation joins 
 In songs of grateful praise 
 You are, You are, You are the one true God 
 From everlasting to everlasting You are God 
 From everlasting to everlasting You are God 
 Eternal, immortal, invisible God 
 Eternal, immortal, invisible God

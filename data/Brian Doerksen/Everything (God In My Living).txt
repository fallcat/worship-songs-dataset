 God in my thinking, God in my speaking 
 Be my everything, be my everything

 God in my watching, God in my waiting 
 God in my laughing, there in my weeping 
 God in my hurting, God in my healing 
 Be my everything, be my everything 
 Be my everything, be my everything

 God in my hurting, God in my healing 
 Be my everything, be my everything 
 Be my everything, be my everything 
 Be my everything, be my everything

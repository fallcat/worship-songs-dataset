Father I can't explain this kind of love, this kind of grace 
 I know, I still break your heart and yet you run to welcome me 
 This is my song of praise to you 
 For who you are and all that you do 
 From the moment my life began, you have been faithful 
 Father, I love the way you hold me close and say my name 
 I know, when my life is through my heart will find it's home in you 
 "And I'm still amazed when I think about the day that I returned. 
 Blinded by my own addictions and grief, I began my journey 
 Expecting rejection, but secretly, secretly hoping for mercy 
 And while I was still a ways off rehearsing my lines, you saw me 
 And you ran to me... you ran to ME! And I began to speak and I said 
 "Father... I've been unfaithful and I am no longer worthy to be called 
 You son..."... "Welcome home son, I've been waiting for you! 
 I AM FAITHFUL! And I will always be your faithful father" 
 This is my song of praise to you 
 For who you are and all that you do 
 From the moment the world began 
 You have been faithful 
 You have been faithful, forever faithful... father

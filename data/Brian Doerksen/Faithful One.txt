Faithful one, so unchanging, 
 Ageless one, You're my rock of peace, 
 Lord of all I depend on You, 
 I call out to You, 
 Again and again, 
 I call out to You, 
 Again and again 
 You are my rock in times of trouble, 
 You lift me up when I fall down, 
 All through the storm, Your love is, 
 The anchor, My hope is in You alone.

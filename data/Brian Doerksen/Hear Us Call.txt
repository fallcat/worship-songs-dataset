Standing here waiting Father make us one 
 We wait for Your outpouring Lord here right now 
 We can't go out till you fill us empty what we can do 
 God of heaven we confess our need to you 
 I see the fire falling I feel in me a start 
 As we begin to worship 
 With heavens language in our hearts 
 I hear the strong wind blowing 
 As you begin to rearrange 
 Something tells me things are about to change 
 Holy Spirit hear us call Come on one, come on us all 
 Fill us now fill us now

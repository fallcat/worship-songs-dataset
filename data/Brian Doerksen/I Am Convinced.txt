I am convinced 
 No force on earth 
 Can separate us 
 From the love of God 
 Angels or demons 
 This life or death 
 Won't separate us 
 From the love of God 
 So high so wide so measureless 
 Filling eternity 
 So strong so deep so intimate 
 Encircling mystery 
 That nothing can take Your love from me 
 Violence or danger 
 Hunger or shame 
 Won't separate us 
 From the love of God 
 I am convinced 
 No force on earth 
 Can separate us 
 From the love of God

I don't need anything, this world says I do 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I don't need anything that I can't afford 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I don't need anything, this world says I do 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I just need Your presence, Your life-giving love 
 I don't need anything but You 
 You are my ever present help 
 You are salvation from myself 
 You are my comfort and my joy 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I don't need anything that You won't supply 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I just need to trust that You will always provide 
 I don't need anything but You 
 You are my ever present help 
 You are salvation from myself 
 You are my comfort and my joy 
 I don't need anything but You 
 You are my ever present help 
 You are salvation from myself 
 You are my comfort and my joy 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I don't need anything 
 I don't need anything but You 
 I don't need anything but You, but You

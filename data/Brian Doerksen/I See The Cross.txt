I see the cross and it's all I need to see 
 I see the cross and it calls me to believe 
 No other way to be reconciled 
 To receive complete forgiveness 
 No other choice could have set us free 
 Could have paid the price of justice 
 So I come as I am 
 To the place where mercy meets me 
 I see the cross 
 I see the cross, lifted high for all to see 
 I see the cross, it's the love the nations need

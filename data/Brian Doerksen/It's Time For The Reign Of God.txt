It's time for the reign of God 
 It's time for Your light to shine 
 It's time for the Kingdom of our God to be revealed 
 It's time for authority 
 It's time for Your majesty 
 It's time for the Kingdom of our God to be revealed 
 In these days of wars and famines 
 In these days when hearts grow cold 
 In these days of growing darkness 
 There's a story to be told 
 So we gather in the Spirit 
 We lift up a prayer of faith 
 We proclaim the mighty Word of God 
 The power in Your name 
 For the captives of rebellion 
 Addicted and deceived 
 For those who wander far from home 
 It's time to intercede

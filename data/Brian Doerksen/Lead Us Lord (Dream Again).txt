Here we stand 
 At a crossroads again 
 Like you said 
 In time the seasons change 
 Looking back 
 We recall the blessing and the pain 
 But now we turn our hearts toward 
 What is still to come 
 We want to dream again 
 Lead us Lord 
 Into a life of fruitfulness 
 Prepare our hearts to risk again 
 As we trust 
 Taking simple steps of obedience we know 
 That you will lead us Lord

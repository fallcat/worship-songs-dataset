Don't let our love grow cold 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 Don't let our vision die 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 You know my heart my deeds 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 I need Your discipline 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 I am here to buy gold refined in the fire 
 Naked and poor 
 Wretched and blind I come 
 Clothe me in white 
 So I won't be ashamed 
 Lord light the fire again 
 Light the fire again, yes 
 Oh yeah 
 Don't let our love grow cold 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 Don't let our vision die 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 You know my heart my deeds 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 I need Your discipline 
 I'm calling out light the fire again 
 I am here to buy gold refined in the fire 
 Naked and poor 
 Wretched and blind I come 
 Clothe me in white 
 So I won't be ashamed 
 Lord light the fire again 
 Lord, light the fire again 
 I need, I need 
 I need Your fire 
 Lord, light the fire again 
 Lord, light the fire again 
 Lord, light the fire again 
 We need Your fire 
 Deep in our souls 
 Be our one desire 
 Oh 
 We need it 
 Oh 
 We need Your fire 
 Lord, we need Your passion 
 Oh, we need You

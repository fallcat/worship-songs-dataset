More than oxygen I need Your love 
 More than life-giving food 
 The hungry dream of 
 More than an eloquent word 
 Depends on the tongue 
 More than a passionate song 
 Needs to be sung 
 More than a word could ever say 
 More than a song could ever convey 
 I need You more than all of these things 
 Father I need You more 
 More than a magnet and steel 
 Are drawn to unite 
 More than poets love words 
 To rhyme as they write 
 More than the comforting warmth 
 Of sun in the spring, yeah 
 More than the eagle loves wind 
 Under its wings 
 More than a word could ever say 
 More than a song could ever convey 
 I love You more than all of these things, anything 
 Father I love You more 
 Your children are crying out, 
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yes, Father we need You, we need You 
 Oh, We need You, we need You 
 More than a blazing fire 
 On a winter's night 
 More than the tall evergreens 
 Reach for the light 
 More than the pounding waves 
 Long for the shore, oh yeah, yeah 
 More than these gifts You give 
 I love You, I love You more 
 More than a word could ever say 
 More than a song could ever convey 
 I love You more than anything 
 Father I love You more 
 Yeah 
 This is 
 This is the song of a fatherless generation 
 Crying out 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh, Father we need You, we need You 
 More than oxygen 
 More than a magnet and steel 
 Yeah, we need Your love 
 Your love 
 Release the Father's love 
 So the children can play

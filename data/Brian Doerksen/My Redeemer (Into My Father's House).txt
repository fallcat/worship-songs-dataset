Jesus come, come reveal whose I am 
 Through Your death You have paid for my life 
 All of my sin has been forgiven through Your blood 
 So I come with confidence into my Father's House 
 I believe You are the lamb the prophets spoke about 
 On the cross You purchased me 
 My life's no longer mine, I'm Yours, my Redeemer 
 Jesus come, come reveal whose I am 
 Through Your death You have paid for my life 
 All of my shame has been exchanged for pure delight

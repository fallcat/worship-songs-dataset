How long O Lord will You forget me 
 How long O Lord will You look the other way 
 How long O Lord must I wrestle with my thoughts 
 And every day have such sorrow in my heart 
 Look on me and answer, O God my Father 
 Bring light to my darkness before they see me fall 
 But I trust in Your unfailing love 
 Yes my heart will rejoice 
 Still I sing of Your unfailing love 
 You have been good, You will be good to me

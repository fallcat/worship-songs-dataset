Purify my heart 
 Let me be as gold 
 And precious silver 
 Purify my heart 
 Let me be as gold 
 Pure gold 
 Refiner's fire 
 My heart's one desire 
 Is to be holy 
 Set apart for You Lord 
 I choose to be holy 
 Set apart for You My Master 
 Ready to do Your will 
 Purify my heart 
 Cleanse me from within 
 And make me holy 
 Purify my heart 
 Cleanse me from my sin 
 Deep within 
 Refiner's fire 
 My heart's one desire 
 Is to be holy 
 Set apart for You Lord 
 I choose to be holy 
 Set apart for You My Master 
 Ready to do Your will 
 Refiner's fire 
 My heart's one desire 
 Is to be holy 
 Set apart for You Lord 
 I choose to be holy 
 Set apart for You My Master 
 Ready to do Your will 
 Oh, yes

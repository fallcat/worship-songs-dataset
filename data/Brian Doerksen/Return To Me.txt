From the ancient days until today 
 I have inspired prophets and poets 
 And the heart of every message 
 Are these three words 
 Return to me 
 I am your Creator - Return to me 
 I am your Redeemer; Your Father - return to me 
 I am your husband - return to me 
 I have longed to hold you in my arms 
 And take all of your fear away 
 I will take your filthy rags and make them clean 
 If you receive my love, if you receive my love 
 Return to Me and hear my Spirit say 
 In repentance and rest is your salvation 
 In quietness and trust is your strength

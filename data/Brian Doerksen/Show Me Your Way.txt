I don't wanna take the selfish road 
 I don't wanna walk the path of pride 
 I only want to follow where You lead 
 I only want to please You with my life 
 Show me Your way, oh, Lord 
 Show me Your way, oh, Lord 
 Banish my fear in perfect love 
 Show me Your way, oh, Lord 
 Show me Your way, oh, Lord 
 Show me Your way, oh, Lord 
 Banish my fear in perfect love 
 Show me Your way, oh, Lord 
 Show me

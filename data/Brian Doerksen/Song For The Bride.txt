I have longed to hold you in My arms 
 And take all of your fear away. 
 I will take your filthy rags 
 And make them clean 
 If you'll receive My love, 
 If you will receive My love. 
 So wait for Me and hear My Spirit say, 
 "In repentance and rest is your salvation. 
 In quietness and trust is your strength."

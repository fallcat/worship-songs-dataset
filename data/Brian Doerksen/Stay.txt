Will you hold me in Your arms 
 As I rest on Your knee, won't You tell me my favorite story 
 I was an orphan, You adopted me 
 As I listen to Your voice the blessing surrounds me 
 I know I'm Yours, I'm so glad You found me 
 I was an orphan, You adopted me 
 Wrap your strong arms around me 
 This is my peace 
 Father, stay close by me 
 Stay 
 As I look in Your eyes I see such kindness 
 Nothing in the world is anything like this 
 I was an orphan, You adopted me 
 Wrap your strong arms around me 
 This is my peace 
 Father, stay close by me 
 Wrap your strong arms around me 
 This is my peace 
 Father, stay close by me 
 Stay

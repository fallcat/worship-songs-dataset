Even when we turned our backs on You 
 In wickedness and lies suppressed Your truth 
 Even then You showed Your love for us 
 Giving up Your life upon the Cross 
 Jesus thank You for the Cross 
 For the blood that sets us free 
 The crimson stain of all our sin 
 Washed away in Your mercy 
 Enemies of God with no excuse 
 Knowing what was right we turned from You 
 Given up to sin condemned to die 
 Even then You chose to give us life 
 Jesus thank You for the Cross 
 For the blood that sets us free 
 The crimson stain of all our sin 
 Washed away in Your mercy 
 Every one of us deserves to die 
 But You save all who hope 
 Jesus thank You for the Cross 
 For the blood that sets us free 
 The crimson stain of all our sin 
 Washed away in Your mercy 
 This is love, yeah 
 Jesus thank You for the Cross 
 For the blood that sets us free 
 The crimson stain of all our sin 
 Washed away in Your mercy

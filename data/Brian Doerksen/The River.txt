To the river I am going 
 Bringing sins I cannot bear 
 Come and cleanse me, come forgive me 
 Lord I need to meet you there 
 In these waters, healing mercy 
 Flows with freedom from despair 
 I am going, to that river 
 Lord I need to meet you there 
 Precious Jesus, I am ready 
 To surrender every care 
 Take my hand now, lead me closer 
 Lord I need to meet you there 
 Come and join us, in the river 
 Come find life beyond compare 
 He is calling, He is waiting 
 Jesus longs to meet you there

Today I choose to follow You 
 Today I choose to give my 'yes' to You 
 Today I choose to hear Your voice and live 
 Today I choose to follow You 
 As for me and my house 
 We will serve You 
 As for me and my house 
 We will spend our lives on You 
 (Repeat chorus and Verse) 
 Wonderful Counselor, Everlasting Father 
 Eternal King, Lord of Hosts 
 Willingly we follow

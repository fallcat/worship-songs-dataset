Whatever comes 
 Whatever season paints this day 
 Whatever trial may come our way 
 We will rely upon Your grace 
 Whatever comes 
 If it's a mountain we must climb 
 Whatever clouds of doubt we find 
 We will press on to reach the prize 
 Whatever comes 
 Whatever comes 
 Cultures will rise as nations fall 
 Troubles will challenge and assault 
 Your word will stand above them all 
 Whatever comes 
 All that we cannot comprehend 
 Disasters will break the pride of men 
 You will be faithful till the end 
 Whatever comes 
 Almighty Immortal 
 Always on Your throne 
 The Sovereign in control 
 Unchanging prevailing 
 Though the nations rage 
 You're still the God who reigns 
 Whatever comes 
 Nothing on earth escapes Your gaze 
 All of creation groans and waits 
 For the revealing of Your name 
 Whatever comes 
 Our enemies will intimidate 
 This is the testing of our faith 
 Still we will stand our ground and wait 
 Whatever comes

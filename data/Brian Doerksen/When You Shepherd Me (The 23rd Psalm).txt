When You shepherd me 
 I have everything that I need 
 When You make me rest 
 Beside a peaceful stream 
 My soul is restored 
 My strength is renewed 
 When you shepherd me 
 When You shepherd me 
 Your rod and staff comfort me 
 As You guide my steps 
 I can trust Your lead 
 Even when I walk 
 Through the valley shadowed with death 
 I will not fear for You are with me 
 I am overwhelmed by love 
 Overtaken by Your mercy 
 Lord Your goodness without end 
 Will be the house in which I dwell 
 When you shepherd me 
 Your prepare a bountiful feast 
 Even when my enemies 
 Are closing in on me 
 You anoint me with oil 
 My cup overflows 
 When You shepherd me

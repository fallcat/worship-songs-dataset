Without You I would have no hope 
 I'd be all alone without You 
 Without You I could not be strong 
 I could not go on without You 
 Without You 
 Who would I be if You didn't love me 
 Who would I be without You 
 Who would I be if You didn't save me 
 Who would I be without You 
 Without You life would make no sense 
 Dreams would always end without You 
 Without You Spring would not appear 
 Storms would never clear without You 
 Without You

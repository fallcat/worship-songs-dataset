My soul is yearning for Your living stream 
 My heart is aching for You 
 All that I long for is found in Your heart 
 You are everything I need 
 You are the thirst 
 You are the stream 
 You are the hunger living deep inside of me 
 You are the food that satisfies 
 You are provision for the journey of our lives 
 You are everything You are

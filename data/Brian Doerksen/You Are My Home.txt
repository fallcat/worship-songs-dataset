Oh, yeah, yeah 
 I've looked for love in so many places 
 Trying to find out where I belong 
 Wandering through this barren land of longing 
 Looking for the place called home, a place called home 
 You said, ?Come to me all you who are so weary 
 And you will find true rest for your souls? 
 Lord, let these words of life speak into my heart 
 Anywhere I am I can be home 
 You are my home, You're my true home 
 I am safe inside the shelter of Your love 
 You are my home, You're my true home 
 I am free to be a child once again 
 Oh, I'm free in You 
 You are my one true destination 
 The place I eternally belong 
 You made me from the earth and then You breathed into me life 
 Redeemed me from my sin and brought me home 
 You are my home, You're my true home 
 I am safe inside the shelter of Your love 
 You are my home, You're my true home 
 I am free to be a child once again 
 My heart is restless, till it rests in You 
 My heart is restless, till it rests in You 
 Until I dwell in You 
 Until I find my home in You 
 Until I find my home in You, yeah 
 I belong to You 
 You are my home, true home 
 You are my home, You are my shelter 
 You are my home, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You are my home, You are my shelter 
 You are my home 
 Bring me home

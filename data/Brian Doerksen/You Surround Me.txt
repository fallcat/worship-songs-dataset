You surround me 
 You indwell me 
 You're beside me 
 Ever present always near 
 You're the whisper 
 Calling my name gently 
 Love eternal 
 Reaching to me jealous for me 
 I will stay with You forever 
 Arm in arm we'll walk together 
 You will never let me go 
 I can't live my life without You 
 My whole will to live is for You 
 You've awakened me to know 
 I can't live my life without You 
 I can't live my life without You 
 I can't live my life without You

I don't know what this day will bring 
 Will it be disappointing, filled with longed for things? 
 I don't know what tomorrow holds 
 Still I know I can trust Your faithfulness 
 I don't know if these clouds mean rain 
 If they do, will they pour down blessing or pain? 
 I don't know what the future holds 
 Still I know I can trust Your faithfulness 
 Certain as the rivers reach the sea 
 Certain as the sunrise in the east 
 I can rest in your faithfulness 
 Surer than a mother's tender love 
 Surer than the stars still shine above 
 I can rest in your faithfulness 
 I don't know how or when I'll die 
 Will it be a thief, or will I have a chance to say goodbye? 
 No, I don't know how much time is left 
 But in the end, I will know your faithfulness 
 When darkness overwhelms my soul 
 When thoughts and storms of doubt 
 Still I trust You are always faithful, always faithful 
 Certain as the rivers reach the sea 
 Certain as the sunrise in the east 
 I can rest in your faithfulness 
 Surer than a mother's tender love 
 Surer than the stars still shine above 
 I can rest in your faithfulness 
 I don't know what this day will bring 
 Will it be disappointing, filled with longed for things? 
 I don't know what tomorrow holds 
 Still I know I can trust Your faithfulness

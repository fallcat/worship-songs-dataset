You were there when life began 
 Spoken words became a man 
 Formed in love my every part 
 You caused the beating of my heart 
 You're beside, behind, before 
 You surround me 
 You're everywhere 
 You chart the path ahead of me 
 Show me all that I can be 
 Every moment you are near 
 In every step, through every fear 
 There is nowhere I can go 
 To be without You 
 You're everywhere 
 Looking to the Heavens, You're there 
 And in the dark depths of despair 
 Even there Your love will find me 
 Knowing that I'm never alone 
 Even if Your hand takes my home 
 To the other side of the sea 
 Your love will find me 
 Your love will find me 
 Precious are Your thoughts to me 
 More wonderful than I can see 
 As I cannot count the sand 
 I cannot count the things You've planned 
 For when I wake up everyday 
 To face the morning 
 You meet me there 
 You're everywhere 
 Looking to the Heavens, You're there 
 And in the dark depths of despair 
 Even there Your love will find me 
 Knowing that I'm never alone 
 Even if Your hand takes my home 
 To the other side of the sea 
 Looking to the Heavens, You're there 
 And in the dark depths of despair 
 Even there Your love will find me 
 Your love will find me 
 Knowing that I'm never alone 
 Even if Your hand takes my home 
 To the other side of the sea 
 Your love will find me 
 Your love will find me 
 Your love will find me 
 Your love will find me 
 Your love will find me

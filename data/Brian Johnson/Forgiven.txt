I will sing for You alone have rescued this life 
 Jesus, You have set me free 
 You alone took away all sin and disgrace 
 When You gave Your life to ransom me 
 I am forgiven at the foot of the cross 
 I am accepted by the power of Your love 
 My every stain is washed away 
 I am forgiven 
 Here I stand in the light of Your glory and grace 
 Where Heaven's love and justice meet 
 Now I live for the One who has called me by name 
 Who is risen and alive in me 
 I'm embraced at the foot of the cross 
 By the love and the mercies You have lavished on us 
 My every stain is washed away 
 I am forgiven

I see Your beauty in the wind 
 I see Your beauty in the rain 
 I feel Your spirit move within 
 I feel Your passion in the pain 
 God You're beautiful to me 
 I see Your glory in the sun 
 I see Your power in the sky 
 When I behold all You've done 
 How could I ever wonder why? 
 You can be my king 
 Lover of my soul 
 You mean everything to me

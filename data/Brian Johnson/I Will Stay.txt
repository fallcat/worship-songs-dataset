I will stay here with You 
 And watch the world go by 
 In this moment with You 
 For the rest of time 
 All my life here with You 
 Means more to You than anything 
 Wasting time spent on You 
 Is everything 
 I will wait until we pass through 
 The door that leads me home 
 I will stay by You forever 
 Your love has made us one 
 Passing time with You Jesus 
 I will spend my life on You, on You 
 Pouring out my love for You Jesus 
 I will give it all just to be with you 
 Just to be with You 
 I will wait until we pass through 
 The door that leads me home 
 I will stay by You forever 
 Your love has made us one

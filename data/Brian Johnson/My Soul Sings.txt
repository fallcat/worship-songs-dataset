Open my eyes to see 
 The wonderful mystery of love 
 Forming into You 
 I'm to the gravity of love 
 Yeah 
 Of love 
 We're standing still 
 In a moment of eternity 
 Where worlds collide 
 And I feel the breath of heaven over me 
 My soul sings 
 My soul sings 
 My soul sings 
 How I love You 
 Open the page and see 
 The wonderful history of love 
 I start and end with You 
 I'm pulled by the gravity of love 
 Yeah 
 Of love 
 We're standing still 
 In a moment of eternity 
 Where worlds collide 
 And I feel the breath of heaven over me 
 My soul sings 
 My soul sings 
 My soul sings 
 How I love You

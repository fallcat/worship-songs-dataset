Oh Lord You're beautiful 
 Your face is all I see 
 And when Your eyes are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 Oh Lord please light the fire 
 That once burned bright and clear 
 Replace the lamp of my first love 
 That burns with holy fear 
 I want to take Your word and shine it all around 
 But first help me just to live it Lord 
 And when I'm doing well help me to never seek a crown 
 For my reward is giving glory to You

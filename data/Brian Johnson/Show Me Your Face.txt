Show me Your face, Lord. Show me Your face 
 Then gird up my legs that I might stand in this holy place 
 Show me Your face, Lord 
 Your power and grace, Your power and grace 
 I could make it to the end if I could just see your face 
 Moses stood on the mountain 
 Waiting for You to pass by 
 You put your hand over his face 
 So in Your presence he wouldn't die 
 All of Israel saw the glory 
 And it shines down though the age 
 Now You've called me to boldly seek Your face. 
 Show me Your face, Lord. Show me Your face 
 Then gird up my legs that I might stand in this holy place 
 Show me Your face, Lord 
 Your power and grace, Your power and grace 
 I could make it to the end if I could just see your face

The video game says "Play me" 
 Face it on a level but it takes you every time on a one on one 
 Feeling running down your spine 
 Nothing gonna save your one last dime cause it owns you 
 Through and through 
 The databank knows my number 
 Says I gotta pay 'cause I made the grade last year 
 Feel it when I turn the screw 
 Kicks you round the world, there ain't a thing that it can't do 
 Do to you 
 Who made who, who made you? 
 Who made who, ain't nobody told you? 
 Who made who, who made you? 
 If you made them and they made you 
 Who picked up the bill, and who made who? (or who picked up the glue,) (?) 
 Who made who, who turned the screw? 
 Satellites send me picture 
 Get it in the eye, 
 Take it to the world (take it to the wire) 
 Spinning like a dynamo 
 Feel it going round and round 
 Running out of chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town 
 So don't look down, no 
 Ain't nobody told you, who made who?

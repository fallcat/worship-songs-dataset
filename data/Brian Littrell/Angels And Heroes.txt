We are the poets, we are the dreamers 
 We are the soldiers, we are the screamers 
 We are the fallen to rise again 
 We are the lovers, we are cynics 
 We are the hours, we are the minutes 
 We are all friends in the end 
 So why be alive if you don't follow your every dream 
 Reach up to Heaven and stand for what you believe 
 We don't need wings to be angels 
 We don't need reasons to be right 
 Your love makes us all better 
 That who we really are 
 Angels and heroes at heart 
 We are the givers, we are receivers 
 We are confessors, we are believers 
 We are the strange familiar face 
 We are afraid and so we follow 
 We're underpaid and so we borrow 
 We mine for tears, but much too late 
 So why can't we open hearts, open our minds 
 Forgiving is easy for You will come if we open our eyes 
 We don't need wings to be angels 
 We don't need reasons to be right 
 Your love makes us all better 
 That who we really are 
 We don't need sleep to be dreamers 
 We don't need to have tears in our eyes 
 Your love makes us all better 
 That's who really are 
 Angels and heroes at heart 
 I know it seems easier to run and hide 
 And bury emotions in the dark of night 
 But it's worth the fight 
 Worth the fight 
 Just aim for the light 
 We don't need wings to be angels 
 We don't need reasons to be right 
 Your love makes us all better 
 That who we really are 
 Angels and heroes at heart

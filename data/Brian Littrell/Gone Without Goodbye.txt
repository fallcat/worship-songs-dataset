Have you seen my son? 
 Not too tall, five-eight 
 She held up a color copy photograph from his wedding day 
 This is his pregnant wife 
 Carrying his last dream 
 He walked down 46 floors before he felt the rush 
 The rush of gasoline 
 I can feel the pain 
 Looking in their eyes 
 But I don't know gone without goodbye 
 If I could reach the sky 
 I'd bring him right back to your arms 
 Though I haven't seen your son 
 He's forever in my life 
 Have you seen my little girl? 
 She's got curly black hair 
 She took this raggedy anne doll everywhere 
 Last I saw her over there 
 Then I heard a choir of screams 
 And a speeding van 
 I watched his tears pour down 
 A father's last attempt at being a rational man 
 I can feel the pain 
 Look into his eyes 
 But I don't know gone without goodbye 
 If I could reach the sky 
 I'd bring her right back to your arms 
 Though I haven't seen your girl 
 She's forever in my life 
 Have you seen my faith? 
 It can run and it can hide 
 Jesus, mend this breaking heart of mine 
 It keeps our love alive 
 I can feel the pain 
 Look into my eyes 
 But I don't know gone without goodbye 
 If I could reach the sky 
 I'd try to turn the world around 
 So that we could see the face 
 And forever stay alive

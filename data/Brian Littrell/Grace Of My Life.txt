I lie awake so often at night 
 With something to read or something to write 
 In the silence my mind is free 
 To think of the ways that God has blessed me 
 It's easy to see how He's been so kind 
 Any proof I might need is right here by my side 
 You are the grace of my life 
 So tender, so undeserved 
 Hard to believe you're my wife 
 Even harder to put what I feel into words 
 If I need evidence God is good 
 Just looking at you is enough 
 You are the grace of my life 
 For you grace my life with your love 
 Love that is pure, so faithful and strong 
 You forgive me when I do you wrong 
 I've seen in you time after time 
 A picture on earth of love so divine 
 Oh, I am amazed for how can it be 
 That someone like you would love someone like me

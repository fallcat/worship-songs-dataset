All to Jesus I surrender 
 All to Him I freely give 
 I will ever love and trust Him 
 In His presence daily live 
 I surrender all 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee, my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all 
 All to Jesus I surrender 
 Humbly at His feet I bow 
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken 
 Take me, Jesus, take me now 
 I surrender all 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee, my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all 
 Lord, I give to You all I ever have 
 And everything I was and everything I am 
 Now I lay it down, I lay it at Your feet 
 To Your grace, to Your power I surrender all 
 Lord, I give myself to thee 
 Fill me with Thy love and power 
 Let Thy blessings fall on me 
 I surrender all 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee, my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all

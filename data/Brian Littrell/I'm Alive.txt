I lived a lot of life 
 I caught a dream or two 
 It's been a sweet ride 
 But I've faced my share of nights 
 Searched like we all do 
 Looking inside 
 Now I'm standing here 
 'Cause You've made it clear 
 This heart inside me beats because 
 You loved enough to take my cross 
 I'm alive 
 You gave Your life to shatter death 
 So even after my last breath 
 I'm alive 
 I'm finally wide awake 
 I'm finished being known 
 It's a new day 
 I feel it on my face 
 In hope's a midnight sun 
 That won't fade 
 I'm bowing down 
 And I'm crying out 
 Forever, forevermore 
 Forever, Lord

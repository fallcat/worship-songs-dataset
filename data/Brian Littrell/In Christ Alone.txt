In Christ alone will I glory 
 Though I could pride myself in battles won 
 For I've been blessed beyond measure 
 And by His strength alone I'll overcome 
 Oh, I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands 
 But those trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stand 
 In Christ alone 
 I place my trust 
 And find my glory in the power of the cross 
 In every victory 
 Let it be said of me 
 My source of strength 
 My source of hope 
 Is Christ alone 
 In Christ alone do I glory 
 For only by His grace I am redeemed 
 For only His tender mercy 
 Could reach beyond my weakness to my need 
 And now I seek no greater honor in just to know Him more 
 And to count my gains but losses to the glory of my Lord 
 In Christ alone 
 I place my trust 
 And find my glory in the power of the cross 
 In every victory 
 Let it be said of me 
 My source of strength 
 My source of hope 
 Is Christ alone 
 In Christ alone 
 I place my trust 
 And find my glory in the power of the cross 
 In every victory 
 Let it be said of me 
 My source of strength 
 My source of hope 
 Is Christ alone

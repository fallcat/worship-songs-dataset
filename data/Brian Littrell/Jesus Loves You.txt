Baylee: I wanna hear Jesus Loves You Daddy. 1, 2, 3, go! 
 All my life I've heard Him say 
 Jesus loves you! 
 I dropped down on my knees to pray 
 Jesus loves you! 
 I asked Him to come into me 
 Jesus loves you! 
 From Him He gives eternity 
 Jesus loves you (yes He does) 
 Jesus loves you (yes He does) 
 Jesus loves you (yes He does) 
 For the Bible tells us so 
 You need to look inside yourself 
 Jesus loves you! 
 You can't take with you all your wealth 
 Jesus loves you! 
 He will give to you an inner strength 
 Jesus loves you! 
 He walked on water but you will sink 
 Jesus loves you! Jesus loves you! Jesus loves you! Oh! 
 For the Bible tells us so 
 Said He's the One that died for me 
 Jesus loves you! 
 And that's the reason I believe 
 Jesus loves you! 
 And He has done the same for you 
 Jesus loves you! 
 So watch and see what He can do 
 Baylee: That was fabulous daddy! I gotta go! I love you daddy and mommy

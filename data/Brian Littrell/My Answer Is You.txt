There's a world of difference when faith is in a heart 
 It stands out like sunlight 
 Life becomes so dark 
 And when those around me ask me why I dare to dream 
 Or why I love or why I sing 
 My answer is You 
 My answer is You 
 You're the hope that my heart is holding on to 
 Skeptics won't understand 
 It's strange from the world's point of view 
 My answer is You 
 They might find it incredible to believe what I can't see 
 They might think it's foolish 
 Or even say it's weak 
 I want to live my life so differently because of faith 
 If it causes them to question, for me to say 
 You're the reason I'm alive 
 For every good thing in my life 
 My answer is You 
 My answer is You 
 You're the hope that my heart is holding on to 
 Skeptics won't understand 
 It's strange from the world's point of view 
 But my answer is plain and it's simple, Lord 
 My answer is You

My shattered dreams and broken 
 Heart are mending on the shelf. 
 I saw you holding hands standing so close to someone else. 
 Now I sit all alone, wishing all my feeling was gone. 
 Gotta get over you?.. 
 Nothing for me to do?.. 
 But have one last cry. 
 One last cry 
 Before I leave it all behind 
 I've gotta put you out of my mind, this time- 
 Stop living a lie. 
 I guess I'm down to one last cry. 
 I was here, you were there. 
 Guess we never could agree. 
 While the sun shines on you, 
 I need some love to rain on me. 
 Still, I sit all alone, 
 Wishing all my feelings were gone. 
 Gotta get over you?. 
 Nothing for me to do?.. 
 But have one last cry. 
 I know I gotta be strong, 
 But 'round me 
 Life goes on and on and on, and on 
 I'm gonna dry my eyes 
 Right after I have my one last cry

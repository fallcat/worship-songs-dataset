I tried to figure it out 
 Time and time again and time again 
 I guess there's just some things I'll never understand 
 'Cause Your ways aren't our ways 
 But deep down in my soul, down in my soul 
 There is one thing I know that I know 
 I'm in over my head 
 Right where I wanna be 
 I'm so lost within Your love 
 The love that always covers me 
 So high, so deep, so wide 
 A strong and cleansing tide 
 My soul has found a place to rest 
 I'm in over my head 
 I've been holding on 
 Now I'm letting go, just letting go 
 Gonna let Your love carry me away 
 I don't know where I'm going 
 But I'm surrounded by the truth 
 And I can feel the current pulling me 
 Deeper and deeper into You 
 You see me for who I am 
 You did reach our Your hand 
 You made me understand 
 That Your love has always covered me

When I think of all the things that God has done for me 
 And how my faith has always conquered adversity 
 I stand amazed to think that God really knows who I am 
 And to think that within me there is a master plan 
 And at night when I pray to the Lord that I know 
 I thank Him for His precious blood He gave to save my soul 
 And that's why 
 We lift You up 
 Higher than the heavens 
 We lift You up (because Your Love is) 
 Deeper than the deepest sea 
 We lift You up 
 Higher than the mountains 
 We lift You up 
 He died for you and me 
 Let me share with you just how I know He's blessed my life 
 He opened up His precious hands and gave me a wife 
 And then He touched her deep down in her soul and gave me a son 
 For it is He that knows no greater love for He is the One 
 And at night when I pray to the Lord that I know 
 I thank Him for His precious blood He gave to save my soul 
 And that is why 
 We lift, we lift You 
 We lift You up

When I left home to be who I am 
 Some people said "No Way" 
 But I laid it all down, gave everything 
 In my head rang the words that my father said 
 You're never far 
 I will be where you are 
 And when you come to me 
 I will open my arms 
 Welcome Home, you 
 I know you by name 
 How do you do? 
 I shine because of you today 
 So come and sit down 
 Tell me how you are 
 I know son, it's good just to see your face. 
 When I look at you holding my heart 
 I will give to you all that I have 
 Son I know there'll be times 
 You will feel all alone 
 I will share with you the words my father said 
 You're never far 
 I will be where you are 
 And when you come to me 
 You can bet I will open my arms 
 Welcome Home, you 
 I know you by name 
 How do you do? 
 I shine because of you today 
 So come and sit down 
 Tell me how you are 
 I know son, it's good just to see your face 
 Said I've been waiting for that day 
 Just to feel your warm embrace 
 Your love has shown 
 I will never be alone 
 You will welcome me home 
 I'll forever be 
 You will say to me 
 Welcome Home, you 
 I know you by name 
 How do you do? 
 I shine because of you today 
 So come and sit down 
 Tell me how you are 
 I know son, it's good just to see your face 
 When I left home to be who I am 
 Some people said "No Way"

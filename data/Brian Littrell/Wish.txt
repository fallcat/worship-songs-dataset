For just a moment 
 I wish I could have been there 
 To see Your first step, hear Your very first word 
 Tell me, did You ever fall and scrape Your knee? 
 Did You know Your wounds would one day heal the world? 
 For just one moment 
 I wish I could have seen You growing 
 Learning the ways of a carpenter's son 
 Just a little boy gazing at the stars 
 Did You remember creating every one? 
 If You passed by, would I have seen a child or a King? 
 Would I have known? 
 I wish I could have been there 
 My only wish is to see You face to face 
 Wish I could have been there 
 Just to see You, Jesus, face to face 
 For just a moment 
 I wish I could have been there 
 When You left Your footprints upon the waves 
 To walk along beside You and never look away 
 Just Your whisper and the wind and sea obey 
 To see You feed the people 
 To feel Your healing in Your touch 
 To hear You pray in the garden alone 
 Laying down Your will with each tear 
 To see You walk that lonely road 
 Willing to die for me 
 And in that moment 
 I know I should have been there 
 You took my cross and gave Your life 
 And You live again! 
 Wish I could have been there 
 My only wish is to see You rise again 
 Wish I could have been there 
 My only wish is to see You, Jesus, face to face 
 Someday I'll be there, I'm gonna be there 
 I'll see Your face, Your mercy, Your grace 
 Someday, someday 
 I'm gonna see You, Jesus 
 Face to face

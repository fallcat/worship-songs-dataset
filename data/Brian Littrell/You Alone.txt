Great and marvelous are Your deeds 
 Lord, God Almighty 
 Just and true are Your ways, King of the ages 
 Who will not fear You, oh Lord 
 And bring glory to Your name? 
 You alone are holy 
 All nations will bow and worship 
 You alone are holy 
 All nations will bow and worship before You 
 Oh before You 
 I sought the Lord and He answered me 
 And delivered me from all of my fears 
 Those who look to Him are radiant with joy 
 And their faces will never be ashamed 
 Who will not fear You, oh Lord 
 And bring glory to Your name? 
 You alone are holy 
 All nations will bow and worship 
 You alone are holy 
 All nations will bow and worship before You 
 Oh before You 
 Who will not fear You, oh Lord 
 And bring glory to Your name 
 You alone are holy 
 All nations will bow and worship 
 You alone are holy 
 All nations will bow and worship before You 
 Oh before You

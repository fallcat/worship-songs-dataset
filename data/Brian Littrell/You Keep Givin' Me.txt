So many reasons to be thankful 
 So many blessings that I can't repay 
 And I never would've made it here without You 
 Sending angels to guide me on my way 
 You keep givin' me joy 
 You keep givin' me happiness 
 You keep givin' me hope 
 You keep givin' me everything I wish 
 You keep holding me up 
 When I'm about to fall 
 And if even all of that was not enough 
 You keep givin' me love 
 (You're givin', You're givin' me love) 
 I know that I'm not always easy 
 And I know I put You through some trying days 
 But in spite of all the worries that I gave You 
 No, You never let my Angels get away 
 You keep givin' me joy 
 You keep givin' me happiness 
 You keep givin' me hope 
 You keep givin' me everything I wish 
 You keep holding me up 
 When I'm about to fall 
 And if even all of that was not enough 
 You keep givin' me love 
 Have I told You lately (have I told ya) 
 How Your love has saved me 
 It takes me to place I've only dreamed 
 I'm so thankful, Lord, for sending me angels 
 You keep givin' me joy 
 You keep givin' me happiness 
 You keep givin' me hope 
 You keep givin' me everything I wish 
 You keep holding me up 
 When I'm about to fall 
 And if even all of that was not enough 
 (X2) 
 You send angels to guide me from up above 
 You just keep gvin' me 
 You just keep givin' me love 
 You're givin' me, givin' me, givin' me... 
 How can I thank you? 
 How can I thank you, Lord? 
 You're the 
 One who's blessed me with everything 
 You keep givin' love... 
 You keep givin' me... givin' me love 
 You! You! You! Givin' me, givin' me 
 You're givin' me, givin' me, givini' me... 
 My everything 
 You keep givin' me love

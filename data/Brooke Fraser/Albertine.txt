I am sitting still 
 I think of Angelique 
 Her mother's voice over me 
 And the bullets in the wall where it fell silent 
 And on a thousandth hill, I think of Albertine 
 There in her eyes what I don't see with my own 
 Rwanda 
 Now that I have seen, I am responsible 
 Faith without deeds is dead 
 Now that I have held you in my own arms 
 I cannot let go till you are 
 And I am on a plane across a distant sea 
 But I carry you in me 
 And in the dust, the dust on my feet 
 Rwanda 
 Now that I have seen, I am responsible 
 Faith without deeds is dead 
 Now that I have held you in my own arms 
 I cannot let go till you are 
 I will tell the world, I will tell them where I've been 
 I will keep my word 
 I will tell them, Albertine 
 Rwanda 
 Now that I have seen, I am responsible 
 Faith without deeds is dead 
 Now that I have held you in my own arms 
 I cannot let go till you are 
 And I am on a stage, a thousand eyes on me 
 I will tell them, Albertine 
 I will tell them, Albertine

I've been staring at the sky tonight 
 Marveling and passing time 
 Wondering what to do with daylight 
 Until I can make you mine 
 You are the one I want 
 You are the one I want 
 I've been thinking of changing my mind 
 It never stays the same for long 
 But of all the things I know for sure 
 You're the only certain one 
 You are the one I want 
 You are the one I want 
 I've been counting up all my wrongs 
 One sorry for each star 
 See I'd apologize my way to you 
 If the heavens stretched that far 
 'Cause you are the one I want 
 You are the one I want 
 I won't find what I am looking for 
 If I only see by keeping score 
 'Cause I know now you are so much more than arithmetic 
 'Cause if I add, if I subtract if I 
 Give it all try to take some back 
 I've forgotten the freedom that comes from the fact 
 That you are the sum 
 So you are one 
 I want... 
 When the years are showing on my face 
 And my strongest days are gone 
 When my heart and flesh depart this place 
 From a life that sung your song 
 You'll still be the one I want 
 You'll still be the one I want 
 You'll still be the one I want 
 You'll still be the one I want

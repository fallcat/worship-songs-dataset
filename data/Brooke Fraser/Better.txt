Take my shoulder back now 
 Your head's too heavy for me 
 Please don't come around here no more 
 'Cause I asked you to stop 
 You didn't 
 I would give anything 
 To make you better 
 I would give anything 
 To point you to free 
 And I would give anything 
 To help you realise 
 I loved you till it killed me 
 So my logic wouldn't hurt you 
 I know you might blame me anyway 
 Well I'm sorry 
 I'm so sorry 
 I would give anything 
 To make you better 
 I would give anything 
 To point you to free 
 I would give anything 
 To help you to realise 
 You're not helping yourself 
 To me 
 I've tried all the things 
 They told me to do 
 Tried to close up the wound 
 Left open by you 
 And if I seemed ever distrusting I am 
 You said you wouldn't do it again 
 You said you wouldn't do it again 
 I would give anything 
 To make you better 
 I would give anything 
 To point you to free 
 And I would give anything 
 To help you realise 
 You're not helping yourself 
 You're not helping yourself by hurting me

You've got a quick snap lock on your cold, cold heart 
 You've got your YSL kicks and a red birthmark 
 In the shape of Canada that you try to keep a secret 
 You got a quick clack walk and a cold hard stare 
 And if your eyes could talk they'd say they just don't care 
 Before they wander off to hide inside their sockets 
 You've got your scars and you've got your birthmarks 
 You've got Toronto hiding on your hip, honey 
 You've got your secrets 
 You've got your regrets 
 Darling, we all do 
 You've got a fool proof plan for a lonely life 
 You won't be no one's daughter and a drunk man's wife 
 If a wife at all, it's a silly institution 
 Or so you keep insisting 
 You've got your scars and you've got your birthmarks 
 You've got Toronto hiding on your hip, honey 
 You've got your secrets 
 You've got your regrets 
 Darling, we all do 
 You're cool, coy, 'bout your strawberry hip 
 It's you that's hidden by the expectations 
 We want to see you, won't you show us where to start 
 You're talking trash with your replica lips 
 It's you that's echoing the conversation 
 Sweet Betty won't you show us who you are 
 You've got your scars and you've got your birthmarks 
 You've got Toronto hiding on your hip, honey 
 You've got your secrets 
 You've got your regrets 
 Darling, we all do 
 You've got a quick snap lock on your cold, cold heart

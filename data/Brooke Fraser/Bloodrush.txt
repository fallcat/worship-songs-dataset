Something inside you 
 Breaks a little bit when you turn away and in 
 Down beneath the pieces 
 You say you don't feel a thing 
 It's atrophy in motion 
 The slowing down of necessary moving parts 
 It wouldn't be so tragic 
 If it weren't machinery of the heart 
 You've got so much soul 
 You've got to get out and prove it to yourself 
 Babe you've got so much soul 
 You got so much soul 
 You're doing a post Morten 
 Of a future you still can have 
 Heed your own warning 
 Those tears in the night 
 Won't fall in the morning 
 You've got so much soul 
 You've got to get out and prove it to yourself 
 Babe you've got so much soul 
 You got so much soul 
 Can you feel it yet? 
 Like a longed for thaw 
 Feel the blood rush back 
 Feel the frost withdraw 
 Vena cava, veins 
 Broken valves and vows 
 Feel the blood rush back 
 Feel the blood rush out 
 You've got so much soul 
 You've got to get out and prove it to yourself 
 Babe you've got so much soul 
 You got so much soul

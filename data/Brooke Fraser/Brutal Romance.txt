All shapes and colors 
 Rolled and stained in aging hands 
 Sculpted explosions 
 Histories unfold 
 Our Jackson Pollocked earth turns 
 A silent witness 
 Lonely as silent 
 Poets bequeath best attempts 
 Romanticizing 
 The brutality 
 Of the ages and of us 
 Avarice and lust 
 Love and death, and death and love 
 Brutal romance 
 The silver thread, the sharpened knife 
 A spinning slow-dance 
 I can't remember before 
 Warmth in the veins, lead in the core 
 Brutal romance 
 You're dripping with gold 
 Mine is more interior 
 Yours is sinking you 
 Men at attention 
 Devouring a drowning fleet 
 Epaulets of charm 
 Love and death, and death and love 
 Brutal romance 
 A silver thread, a sharpened knife 
 In a spinning slow-dance 
 I can't remember before 
 Breath in the lungs, blood on the door 
 Brutal romance 
 And I want to sing 
 Over them and into them 
 What can't be unsung 
 And I want to sing 
 Over you and into you 
 What can't be unsung 
 Love and death, and death and love 
 Brutal romance 
 A silver thread, a sharpened knife 
 A spinning slow-dance 
 I can't remember before 
 Washing of wounds, won inner wars 
 Brutal romance

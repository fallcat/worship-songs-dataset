If I find in myself desires nothing in this world can satisfy 
 I can only conclude that I was not made for here 
 If the flesh that I fight is at best only light and momentary 
 Then of course I'll feel nude when to where I'm destined I'm compared 
 Speak to me in the light of the dawn 
 Mercy comes with the morning 
 I will sigh and with all creation groan as I wait for hope to come for me 
 Am I lost or just less found? On the straight or on the roundabout of the wrong way? 
 Is this a soul that stirs in me, is it breaking free, wanting to come alive? 
 'Cause my comfort would prefer for me to be numb 
 And avoid the impending birth of who I was born to become 
 Speak to me in the light of the dawn 
 Mercy comes with the morning 
 I will sigh and with all creation groan as I wait for hope to come for me 
 For we, we are not long here 
 Our time is but a breath, so we better breathe it 
 And I, I was made to live, I was made to love, I was made to know you 
 Hope is coming for me 
 Hope, He's coming 
 Hope is coming for me 
 Hope, He's coming 
 Speak to me in the light of the dawn 
 Mercy comes with the morning 
 I will sigh and with all creation groan as I wait for hope to come for me

The 'forninan last light and I'm right beside you 
 The fire and motion, the fire and motion 
 The desert sun sinking sleepy and low 
 But we're just waking, We are waking 
 River time is a mountain tonight 
 Before tomorrow she flows on 
 Carving valleys in the skin on our faces 
 I am bright as the sun, You are high as a kite 
 We are daughters, sons, brothers and sisters tonight 
 At Coachella 
 Coachella 
 Come on now darling, let's shake off these blues 
 I'll let my hair out, you'll slip off your shoes 
 I feel like a baby, newborn in the spring 
 I'm setting down this sadness and I won't remember it 
 When I'm bright as the sun 
 And you are high as a kite 
 And we are daughters, sons, brothers and sisters tonight 
 At Coachella, Coachella 
 I'm a warm beating heart, you're a generous soul 
 And I love you though I'd never met you before 
 Till Coachella, Coachella 
 We are standing on the shore 
 In the smoke, in the starlight 
 On the edge of a human sea 
 And the tide is in 
 I am bright as the sun, you are high as a kite 
 We are daughters, sons, brothers and sisters tonight 
 At Coachella, Coachella 
 I'm a warm beating heart, you're a generous soul 
 And I love you though I'd never met you before 
 Till Coachella, Coaechella 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Coachella

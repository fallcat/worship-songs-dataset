It was the year the crows and the locusts came 
 The fields drank dry the rain 
 The fields are bleeding 
 "Daddy don't cry, it'll be all right" 
 She puts some water on the wound 
 And hums a little tune 
 While her courage puddles on the ground 
 Pooling, pooling 
 See the murder and the swarm descend 
 And the night is getting thick 
 The moon turning her tricks 
 She'll betray you every time 
 It was the year the crows and the locusts came 
 The fields drank dry the rain 
 The fields are bleeding 
 It was the age the foxes came for the fields 
 We were bleeding as we bowed to kneel 
 And pray for mercy, pray for mercy 
 The rumble is low and the heat is high 
 Got a feeling that there's rain out in the oil black sky 
 Gonna chase away the devil when that song does rise 
 Gonna plead the blood, gonna plead the blood 
 It was the year the crows and the locusts came 
 The fields drained dry the rain 
 The fields are bleeding 
 It was the age the foxes came for the fields 
 We were bleeding as we bowed to kneel 
 And pray for mercy, pray for mercy 
 She limps on up to the top of a mound 
 Looks at the faltered harvest 
 Feels her sweat in the ground and the burn in her nose 
 And the knowing in her guts something's still gonna grow 
 She ain't leaving till it does 
 What can wash away my sin 
 Nothing but the blood 
 What can make me whole again 
 Nothing but the blood

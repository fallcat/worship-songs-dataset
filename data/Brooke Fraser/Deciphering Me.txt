Friend, it's getting late 
 We should be going 
 We've been sat here beneath these flickering neons for hours 
 While I am cracking their code, you are deciphering me 
 For I am a mystery, I am a locked room in a tall tower 
 Oh, can you feel the gravity falling, calling us home? 
 Oh, did you see the stars colliding, shining just to show we belong? 
 We belong 
 Your telescope eyes see everything clearly 
 My vision is blurred but I know what I heard echoing all around 
 Well I am tuning you in, you are deciphering me 
 Not such a mystery, not such a faint and far away sound 
 Oh, can you feel the gravity falling, calling us home? 
 Oh, did you see the stars colliding, shining just to show we belong? 
 We belong 
 It's love, it's love that holds us 
 We will be alright 
 It's truth, it's truth that shows us 
 If we'll walk in its light 
 It's love, it's love that holds us 
 We will be alright 
 It's truth, it's truth that shows us 
 If we'll walk in His light 
 Oh, can you feel the gravity falling, calling us home? 
 Oh, did you see the stars colliding, shining just to show we belong? 
 We belong 
 We belong 
 We belong

There's a distance in the air and I cannot make it leave 
 I wave my arms 'round about me and blow with all my might 
 I cannot sense you close, though I know you're always here 
 But the comfort of you near is what I long for 
 When I can't feel you, I have learned to reach out just the same 
 When I can't hear you, I know you still hear every word I pray 
 And I want you more than I want to live another day 
 And as I wait for you maybe I'm made more faithful 
 All the folly of the past, though I know it is undone 
 I still feel the guilty one, still trying to make it right 
 So I whisper soft your name, let it roll around my tongue, 
 knowing you're the only one who knows me 
 You know me 
 When I can't feel you, I have learned to reach out just the same 
 When I can't hear you, I know you still hear every word I pray 
 And I want you more than I want to live another day 
 And as I wait for you maybe I'm made more faithful 
 Show me how I should live this 
 Show me where I should walk 
 I count this world as a loss to me 
 You are all I want 
 You are all I want 
 When I can't feel you, I have learned to reach out just the same 
 When I can't hear you, I know you still hear every word I pray 
 And I want you more than I want to live another day 
 And as I wait for you maybe I'm made more faithful 
 As I wait for you maybe I am made more faithful

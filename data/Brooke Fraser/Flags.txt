Come, tell me your trouble 
 I'm not your answer but I'm a listening ear 
 Reality has left you reeling 
 All facts and no feeling 
 No faith and all fear 
 I don't know why a good man will fall 
 While a wicked one stands 
 And our lives blow about 
 Like flags on the land 
 Who's at fault is not important 
 Good intentions lie dormant and we're all to blame 
 While apathy acts like an ally 
 My enemy and I are one and the same 
 I don't know why the innocents fall 
 While the monsters still stand 
 And our lives blow about 
 Like flags on the land 
 I don't know why our words are so proud 
 Yet their promise so thin 
 And our lives blow about 
 Like flags in the wind 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 You who mourn will be comforted 
 You who hunger will hunger no more 
 Oh, the last shall be first 
 Of this I am sure 
 You who weep now will laugh again 
 Oh, you lonely be lonely no more 
 Yes the last will be first, of this I'm sure 
 I don't know why the innocents fall 
 While the monsters stand 
 I don't know why the little ones thirst 
 But I know the last shall be first 
 I know the last shall be first 
 I know the last shall be first

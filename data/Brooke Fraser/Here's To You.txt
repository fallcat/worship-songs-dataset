Cheers to the furrows on our brow 
 To each hard won victory 
 Cheers to the losses that grew us up 
 Killed our pride, and filled our cup 
 Cheers to the friendships well worn in 
 That time nor distance alter 
 Here's to the sleepers we'll see again 
 Fine company in memoriam 
 Open your mouth and sing out your song 
 Life is short as the day is long 
 I can't leave you my body 
 But I'll leave you a tune 
 This is my legacy 
 Cheers to you 
 Cheers to the passing of our youth 
 And the death of lust not wonder 
 A toast to the lessons not yet learned 
 And to the trials that will teach them 
 Open your mouth and sing out your song 
 Life is short as the day is long 
 I can't leave you my body 
 But I'll leave you a tune 
 This is my legacy 
 Cheers to you 
 Open your mouth and sing out your song 
 Life is short as the day is long 
 I can't leave you my body 
 But I'll leave you a tune 
 Open your mouth, and sing out your song 
 Life is short as the day is long 
 I can't leave you my body 
 But I'll leave you a tune 
 This is my legacy 
 This is my legacy 
 This is my legacy 
 Cheers to you

I just spoke silence with the seeker next to me 
 She had a heart with hesitant, halting speech 
 That turned to mine and asked belligerently, "what do I live for?" 
 I see the stars of searches everywhere I go 
 From hearts to wars to literature to radio 
 There's a question like a shame no one will show, "what do I live for?" 
 We are Hosea's wife 
 We are squandering this life 
 Using people like ladders and words like knives 
 If we've eyes to see 
 If we've ears to hear 
 To find it in our hearts and mouths 
 The word that saves is near 
 Shed that shallow skin 
 Come and live again 
 Leave all you were before 
 To believe is to begin 
 There is truth in little corners of our lives 
 There are hints of it in songs and children's eyes 
 It's familiar, like an ancient lullaby 
 What do I live for? 
 We are Hosea's wife 
 We are squandering this life 
 Using bodies like money and truth like lies 
 If we've eyes to see 
 If we've ears to hear 
 To find it in our hearts and mouths 
 The word that saves is near 
 Shed that shallow skin 
 Come and live again 
 Leave all you were before 
 To believe is to begin 
 We are more than dust 
 That means something 
 That means something 
 We are more than just blood and emotions 
 Inklings and notions, atoms on oceans 
 We are Hosea's wife 
 We are squandering this life 
 Using people like ladders and words like knives 
 If we've eyes to see 
 If we've ears to hear 
 To find it in our hearts and mouths 
 The word that saves is near 
 Shed that shallow skin 
 Come and live again 
 Leave all you were before 
 To believe is to begin 
 To believe is to begin 
 To believe is to begin 
 To believe is to begin 
 To believe is to begin

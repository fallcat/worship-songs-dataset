If to distant lands I scatter 
 If I sail to farthest seas 
 Would you find and firm and gather 
 Till I only dwell in Thee? 
 If I flee from greenest pastures 
 Would you leave to look for me? 
 Forfeit glory to come after 
 Till I only dwell in Thee 
 If my heart has one ambition 
 If my soul one goal to seek 
 This my solitary vision 
 Till I only dwell in Thee 
 That I only dwell in Thee 
 Till I only dwell in Thee

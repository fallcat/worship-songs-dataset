The lone woman stands in the turning December 
 She's got ice on her lashes, white on her winter coat 
 The trees stand like soldiers around her 
 Dutiful wooden guards 
 And the heart she feared frozen 
 Still beats and still marches on 
 Oh, Annie 
 I will think of you each time I see the sun 
 Didn't want a day without you 
 But somehow I've lived through another one 
 A gentlemen waits on a platform in a haze of gray and grief 
 Now he's sold up his assets, starting over at 70 
 The steam blasts like trumpets around him, salutes on the colonnade 
 As he thinks to himself "we're all waiting for our train to come" 
 Oh, Annie 
 I will think of you each time I see the sun 
 Didn't want a year without you 
 But somehow I've lived through another one 
 Did you find it hard to breathe at first? 
 Were you winded and in disbelief at how much it hurt? 
 Now the ache's still burning, but the world's still turning 
 Isn't it? 
 Oh, Annie 
 I still think of you each time I see the sun 
 Didn't want a life without you 
 But here I am living one

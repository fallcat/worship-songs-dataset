Walk along here, feel you move 
 Somewhere in front of me 
 I can't place you with these eyes 
 For the doubt, I can't see 
 How could someone so beautiful 
 Feel something for me 
 Hold me and love me and touch me again 
 And show me why I believe 
 That the first time I see your face 
 Everything else around me will fade to the background 
 And I'll be struck full by the truth in your gaze 
 As you work 
 An indelible change in me 
 All I have and all I am 
 And all I think and do 
 Can find its purpose and meaning 
 And life only in you 
 How could someone so beautiful 
 Feel anything for me 
 Won't you hold me and love me and touch me again 
 And show me why I believe 
 That the first time I see your face 
 Everything else around me will fade to the background 
 And I'll be struck full by the truth in your gaze 
 As you work 
 An indelible change 
 For the first time I see your face 
 Everything else around me will fade to the background 
 And I'll be struck full by the truth in your gaze 
 As you work 
 An indelible change in me 
 An indelible change in me 
 An indelible change in me

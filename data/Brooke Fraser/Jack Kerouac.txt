He got the droop of a fatherless child 
 Almost imperceptible, one can't see it with the naked eye 
 Oh but I can 
 That cardboard lady in the corner store 
 Her sparkle is all painted on 
 Six no-good men took her shine and more 
 Left her youth near Sausalito 
 Oh it's humourless and comical at once 
 Always being a stranger wearing the last town's dust 
 Oh it's humourless, it's humourless 
 They look me over, one up and one down 
 I can tell they're wondering who my people are 
 I say I'm new in town 
 I know it's gonna take a while 
 Oh it's humourless and comical at once 
 Always being a stranger wearing the last town's dust 
 Oh it's humourless, it's humourless 
 I speculate and browse the duraflame 
 Winter in the west coast cool 
 Out by the sea where no one knows my name 
 I'm on the road like Jack Kerouac 
 Like Jack, Jack Kerouac 
 Like Jack, Jack Kerouac 
 Like Jack, Jack Kerouac

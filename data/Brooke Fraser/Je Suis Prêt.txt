I looked away while the water was receding 
 I looked away for a second, for a second 
 And it's gone, everyone was caught sleeping 
 I am awake and the air is pulsating 
 I am awake, as it gathers, see it growing 
 I'm in doubt, here it comes, am I ready? 
 Am I ready? 
 See the tempest looking my way 
 Drain the skies of all their color 
 And I need eye to eye 
 With a fire in my breast 
 Je suis pret 
 I am ready, I am ready 
 Je suis pret 
 I am ready, I am ready 
 I will be healed, and my brother, so shall you be 
 Stand over here, by my side 
 We will awake to the river, to the river 
 Washing away all our shy 
 See the tempest looking my way 
 Drain the skies of all their color 
 And I need eye to eye 
 With a fire in my breast 
 Je suis pret 
 I am ready, I am ready 
 Je suis pret 
 I am ready, I am ready 
 Wash away 
 Wash away 
 Wash away 
 Wash away 
 See the tempest looking my way 
 Drain the skies of all their color 
 And we need eye to eye 
 With a fire in our my breast 
 Nous sommes prêts 
 We are ready, we are ready 
 Nous sommes prêts 
 We are ready, we are ready

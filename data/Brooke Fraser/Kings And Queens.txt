We've got a long way to go but we got the energy 
 It took a little while to find reality 
 We've come a long way you know, living inside a dream 
 Waking to find that we are kings and queens 
 Lights on 
 Sometimes this feels like sleeping with the lights on 
 The memories stay 
 They loop their lies on endless replay 
 Been sleeping where I fall if I can sleep at all 
 'Cause I wake where I wanna if I wake at all 
 To see the lines are blurred, reality deferred 
 And we're chasing down tomorrow 
 We've got a long way to go but we got the energy 
 It took a little while to find reality 
 We've come a long way you know, living inside a dream 
 Waking to find that we are kings and queens 
 Ride on 
 Let's ditch the dark babe, we just gotta ride on 
 Don't let lies through 
 They'll trick your mind and turn your heart to stone 
 Forget the wars we fight, forget the tears you cry 
 'Cause we go where we wanna but that won't be tonight 
 To see the edges fade between the light and shade 
 And we're chasing down forever 
 We've got a long way to go but we got the energy 
 It took a little while to find reality 
 We've come a long way you know, living inside a dream 
 Waking to find that we are kings and queens 
 We've got a long way to go but we got the energy 
 It took a little while to find it, to find it, to find it 
 We've come a long way you know, living inside a dream 
 It took a little while to find it, to find it, to find it 
 We've got a long to go but we got the energy 
 It took a little while to find reality 
 We've come a long way you know, living inside a dream 
 Waking to find that we are kings and queens 
 We've got a long to go but we got the energy 
 It took a little while to find reality 
 We've come a long way you know, living inside a dream 
 Waking to find that we are kings and queens

I have this sinking feeling 
 Something's weighing me down 
 I am completely saturated 
 The waves are crashing closer 
 My feet already drowned 
 Doing the thing I said I hated 
 They've been swimming in the wrong waters 
 Now they're pulling me down 
 But I am clinging to you never letting go 
 'Cause I know that you'll lift me out 
 Have your way here 
 Keep me afloat 
 'Cause I know I'll sink without you 
 Take this ocean of pain that is mine 
 Throw me a lifeline 
 I wake up feeling convicted 
 I know something's not right 
 Reacquaint my knees with the carpet 
 I have to get this out 
 'Cause it's obstructing you and I 
 Dry up the seas that keep us parted 
 'Cause they've been swimming in the wrong waters 
 And now they're pulling me down 
 But I am clinging to you never letting go 
 'Cause I know that you are gonna pull me out 
 Have your way here 
 Keep me afloat 
 'Cause I know I'll sink without you 
 Take this ocean of pain that is mine 
 Throw me a lifeline 
 Ooh, oh, yeah 
 'Cause they've been swimming in the wrong waters 
 And now they're pulling me down 
 But I am clinging to you never letting go 
 'Cause I know oh (I won't let go, I won't let go) 
 'Cause I know (I won't let go, I won't let go) 
 Yeah 
 That you'll have your way here 
 Keep me afloat 
 'Cause I know I'll sink without you 
 Take this ocean of pain that is mine 
 (I won't let go, I won't let go) 
 (I won't let go, I won't let go) 
 (I won't let go, I won't let go) 
 Take this ocean of pain that is mine 
 Throw me a lifeline

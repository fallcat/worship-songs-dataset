In the autumn on the ground, between the traffic and the ordinary sounds 
 I am thinking signs and seasons while a north wind blows through 
 I watch as lovers pass me by 
 Walking stories - whos and how's and whys 
 Musing lazily on love 
 Pondering you 
 I'll give it time, give it space and be still for a spell 
 When it's time to walk that way we wanna walk it well 
 I'll be waiting for you baby 
 I'll be holding back the darkest night 
 Love is waiting till we're ready, till it's right 
 Love is waiting 
 It's my caution not the cold 
 There's no other hand that I would rather hold 
 The climate changes, I'm singing for strangers about you 
 Don't keep time, slow the pace 
 Honey hold on if you can 
 The bets are getting surer now that you're my man 
 I'll be waiting for you baby 
 I'll be holding back the darkest night 
 Love is waiting till we're ready, till it's right 
 I could write a million songs about the way you say my name 
 I could live a lifetime with you and then do it all again 
 And like I can't force the sun to rise or hasten summer's start 
 Neither should I rush my way into your heart 
 I'll be waiting for you baby 
 I'll be holding back the darkest night 
 Love is waiting till we're ready, till it's right 
 Love is waiting till we're ready, till it's right 
 Love is waiting

Love, where is your fire? I've been sitting here smoking away 
 Making signals with sticks and odd ends and bits, but still there's no sign of a flame 
 Imposters have been passing, offering a good-feeling glow 
 But I'm holding out for what you are about, an inferno that burns to the bone 
 Some urge me to be temperate, lukewarm will never do 
 'Cause I, I wanna blaze with you 
 So I'm holding my heart out to you 
 Holding my heart out 
 So I stand, handing out torches 
 Speaking words that are lamps to their feet 
 Till the time when you come and I'm whole and we are one and the fire in me is complete 
 Some tell me to be moderate but lukewarm will never do 
 'Cause I, I wanna blaze with you 
 So I'm holding my heart out to you 
 Then a doubt comes to lie at the back of my mind 
 That I'll offer you me and you'll politely decline (no thank you) 
 So I hasten to mute it, I'll shout and rebuke it, "away" 
 'Cause I, I wanna blaze with you 
 So I'm holding my heart out to you 
 So I'm holding my heart out to you 
 Holding my heart out 
 Holding my heart out 
 Holding my heart out 
 Holding my heart out

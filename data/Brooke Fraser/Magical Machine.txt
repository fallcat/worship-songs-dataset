I'm your telescope 
 Help you see other worlds up close 
 I'm your submarine 
 You'll explore where you've never been 
 I'm your ticking clock 
 Hold my hands and the time will stop 
 I'm your megaphone 
 Turn you up till the neighbours moan 
 Power me on 
 Light on demand 
 I'm your magical machine 
 We can dream digital dreams 
 Power me on 
 Control and command 
 I'm your magical machine 
 I'll be yours if you let me 
 I'm your MRI 
 Show you what's going on inside 
 I'm your ATM 
 Take what you like my supply won't end 
 I'm your MP3 
 I get sad when you don't pay for me 
 I'm your IED 
 Carry me very carefully 
 Power me on 
 Light on demand 
 I'm your magical machine 
 We can dream digital dreams 
 Power me on 
 Control and command 
 I'm your magical machine 
 I'll be yours if you let me 
 I'm wires and welding 
 Preset to auto 
 But if I wasn't you would never know 
 I'm wires and welding 
 Preset to auto 
 But if I wasn't you would never know 
 Power me on 
 Light on demand 
 I'm your magical machine 
 We can dream digital dreams 
 Power me on 
 Control and command 
 I'm your magical machine 
 I'll be yours if you let me

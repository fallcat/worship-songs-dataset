I have got a mind to take you away 
 To some white sand and a palm tree parade 
 I have got a mind to take you away 
 I have got a mind to go 
 I have got a smile that's only for you 
 Exchanged in secret, the way lovers do 
 I have got a smile that's only for you 
 Baby, I have got a smile 
 Morning sneaks up on us 
 Shines on our sheets 
 Waking me into my favorite dream 
 My best imagining never implied 
 That you'd be the dawning that ended my night 
 Uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 I have got the will to love you always 
 Through the chilliest winter 
 The hot summer haze 
 I have got the will to love you always 
 I have got the will to love 
 Honey, I know it won't always be sweet 
 Loving a person is not a small feat 
 Don't give up on me and I won't on you 
 Pack your bags baby 'cause I'm taking you 
 Uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm

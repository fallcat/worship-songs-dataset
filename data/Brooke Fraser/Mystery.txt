I wanna get your words 
 Stuck in my head 
 I wanna touch your soul with mine 
 I want to always be 
 Be by you led 
 Always 
 I wanna know that you 
 Hung the stars in the sky 
 So on lonely nights I would know your presence 
 I wanna feel your love 
 Under my skin 
 Down through my bones 
 Your love 
 Endures forever 
 Your love 
 Changes me 
 Your love 
 Makes me whole 
 Makes me better 
 Your love endures 
 I wanna feel the wind 
 And know that you're near me 
 And see in the seasons your mystery 
 I wanna feel your love 
 Flow through my veins 
 Pound in my heart 
 Your love 
 Endures forever 
 Your love 
 Changes me 
 Your love 
 Makes me whole 
 Makes me better 
 I want to know 
 How this could be 
 Yet your love remains 
 A mystery 
 That's woven all the way 
 That's woven all the way 
 That's woven all the way 
 Through me, yeah-yeah 
 Ooh 
 In me 
 Your love 
 Endures forever 
 Your love 
 It changes me 
 Your love 
 Makes me whole 
 Makes me better 
 Your love endures

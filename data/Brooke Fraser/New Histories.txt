Blind man on a broken beam 
 Sharks circling under 
 Fine frenzies and rosy scenes 
 I don't know which you are to me 
 Time passes for everyone 
 New histories, same old sun 
 One flame ignites, another dies 
 No one gets out of here alive 
 And I wait 
 I stare at the space you left 
 It stares back unimpressed 
 I said I was sorry 
 Now when will you come home to me 
 And I wait 
 Something's gotta give, oh can't you see 
 Someone's gonna win eventually 
 We could write a new history 
 Oh, let's write our new history

It's been a loud year and I really need the quiet 
 It's been a loud year and I really need the quiet 
 It's New Year's Eve, babe 
 And I'd really like to be alone 
 We're waiting on change but I don't know if it's coming 
 We're waiting on change but I don't know if it's coming 
 It's New Year's Eve, babe 
 And I'd really like to be alone 
 Big eyes against the white 
 Big eyes beneath the lights 
 And no one seems to feel it 
 But I do 
 Our faces to the wind 
 My heart against my skin 
 Tonight I'm gonna find something true 
 It's been a loud year and I really need the quiet 
 It's been a loud year and I really need the quiet 
 It's New Year's Eve, babe 
 And I'd really like to be alone

In me, in you 
 Orphans, kingdoms 
 Wide eyes and paper crowns 
 Time will hold us 
 Time erode us 
 We're wrinkling children now 
 We are wandering where the wild wind blows 
 We are happy here 'cause the wild wind knows 
 What we are 
 Orphans, kingdoms 
 In me, in you 
 Fiends, explorers 
 Babes with coats of arms 
 A world inside us 
 A feast, a harvest 
 Each soul a son, a star 
 We are wandering where the wild wind blows 
 We are happy here 'cause the wild wind knows 
 What we are 
 Orphans, kingdoms 
 Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die 
 We will look our maker in the eye 
 Raise a flagon and drink to your health 
 Who is he that can conquer himself 
 We are wandering where the wild wind blows 
 We are happy here 'cause the wild wind knows 
 What we are 
 Orphans, kingdoms

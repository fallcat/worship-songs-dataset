This carnival sometimes 
 Has sinister intentions 
 Only a intervention 
 Can save me now 
 You have to have balls nowadays 
 Not to give in to temptation 
 These regular revelations from you 
 Show me how 
 I'm workin' to be pliable 
 Take me in your hands and mould me 
 I am yours 
 That's undeniable 
 But I am weak so take me in 
 And hold me 
 All these worldly things 
 That I can't even touch 
 Everyone else is grabbin' them 
 And enjoyin' them so much 
 To resist them 
 Takes more than my might 
 So through your strength 
 Oh heal me tonight 
 I'm workin' to be pliable 
 Take me in your hands and mould me 
 I am yours 
 That's undeniable 
 But I am weak so take me in 
 And hold me 
 I'm workin' to be pliable 
 Take me in your hands and mould me 
 I am yours 
 That's undeniable 
 But I am weak so take me in 
 But I am weak so take me in 
 And hold me

I love your projection but I don't love you 
 Your perceived perfection though it's just not true 
 I want an escape and tonight that's you 
 You are my victim, you are my muse 
 Just one specimen of a multitude 
 I want a clich√© I can click on cue 
 Psychosocial

 Psychosocial 
 Give me all access, give me what I want 
 The companionship of your "tableu vivants" 
 I'm entertained until I'm not

 You don't call, you don't write 
 It's like I don't even know you 
 You don't look, you never reply 
 And you won't 'cause I'm a psychosocial 
 It's like I don't even know you 
 And you won't 'cause I'm a psychosocial 
 It's like I don't even know you 
 It's like I don't even know you 
 I love your projection but I don't love you

I'm having trouble remembering 
 Where the lines cross your face 
 Your smile is fading from memory 
 Won't you hurry back and fill that space again 
 I'm waiting, watching the water (ooh ooh) 
 Quietly willing the phone to ring (ooh ooh) 
 But I suspect this healthy silence (ooh ooh) 
 Will continue a few days yet, a few days yet (ooh ooh) 
 I miss you 
 I miss you 
 I'm over now 
 I'm through 
 I miss you 
 Do do do do do mm-mm 
 I'm hanging here, just reminiscing (ooh ooh) 
 About all the things you said to me-yeah (ooh ooh) 
 Hoping you plan on returning-yo (ooh ooh) 
 To interrupt my reverie 
 'Cause I miss you 
 I miss you, baby 
 I'm over now 
 I'm through 
 I miss you 
 You're sweet, sweeter than honey tea 
 You're precious and worth more than gold to me 
 I know I acted selfishly 
 Come on home 
 I'll beg and plead if you need me to 
 I'm head over heals over feet for you 
 Gonna have you wed by the end of this tune 
 Well I hope 
 I miss you 
 I miss you (hey hey) 
 Don't say we're done (ooh) 
 We ain't through 
 (Ooh) ooh 
 (Ooh) mm 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh) 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh) mm-mm-mm 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh) mmm 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh) mm-mm

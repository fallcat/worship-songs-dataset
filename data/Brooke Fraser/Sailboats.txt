We're adrift on a sailboat 
 My love is the sea 
 Yours is the horizon 
 Constant and steady 
 You set my lamdlocked hard afloat 
 Lifted my lonesome sails 
 The tide is out, the moon is high 
 We're sailing 
 Darling, your love is healing 
 It makes the bitter sweet 
 Warms the winter to spring again 
 Secures the cold's defeat 
 We're cutting anchor 
 Casting out into the glorious deep 
 The tide is out, the moon is high 
 We're sailing 
 When we've succumbed to decrepitude 
 Still our love will remain in its youth 
 The tide is out, the moon is high 
 We're sailing 
 We're sailing 
 We're sailing

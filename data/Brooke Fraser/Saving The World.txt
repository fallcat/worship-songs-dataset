Didn't I tell you everything's fine 
 If there's a good and bad we're somewhere in between 
 Often I feel like we're all navigating blind 
 Could we get a change of pace to set the scene 
 We could stay another day in this confusion 
 Let it permeate us till we can't move on 
 And while we're waiting we could try saving the world 
 Or are we storing that up for a rainy day? 
 I'm anticipating the time when it'll be my turn 
 It could be fun to try 
 I think that I'll save the world as a fun afternoon activity 
 Seventy thousand things to ponder today 
 The most significant are bottom of the list 
 Forty five million recipes and ways 
 To exaggerate and compound the stress 
 We could stay another day in this apathy 
 Let it permeate us till we're numb through 
 And while we're waiting we could try saving the world 
 Or are we storing that up for a rainy day? 
 I'm anticipating the time when it'll be my turn 
 It could be fun to try 
 I think that I'll save the world 
 (Oh oh) ooh, ooh, ooh 
 And while we're waiting we could try saving the world 
 Or are we storing that up for a rainy day? 
 I'm anticipating the time when it'll be my turn 
 It could be fun to try 
 I think that I'll save? 
 And while we're waiting we could try saving the world 
 Or are we storing that up for a rainy day? 
 And I'm anticipating the time when it'll be my turn 
 It could be fun to try 
 I think that I'll save the world

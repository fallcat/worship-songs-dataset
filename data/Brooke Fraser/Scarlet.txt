Middle of nowhere 
 Finally you can breathe 
 Nobody knows your name 
 It's easier 
 Shut your eyes tightly 
 Clench your fists till they almost bleed 
 Cautiously, lightly 
 Gently expose what's underneath 
 And all you feel now 
 Is the scarlet of the day 
 Even if it's real 
 You can't stay... 
 So there you go 
 You're gone for good 
 There you go 
 You're gone for good 
 Your mind is swollen 
 From months of thought without release 
 They've taken their toll on you 
 This very moment 
 Of timid and fragile honesty 
 Is precious and rare and fleeting 
 And all you feel now 
 Is the scarlet in the day 
 Even if it's real 
 You can't stay... 
 So there you go 
 You're gone for good 
 There you go 
 You're gone for good 
 There you go 
 You're gone for good 
 There you go 
 You're gone for good

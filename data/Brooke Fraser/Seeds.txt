Night 
 Field of stars above us 
 You pick one, we frame it with our fingers intertwined 
 Seeds of every generation between our hands 
 And the promise to teach you the little I have learned so far 
 Child 
 What will you live to do? 
 What have I left for you? 
 What will we leave behind? 
 You learning as you're growing 
 Not yet knowing the world 
 Isn't always quite as beautiful 
 As it is now 
 Child 
 What will you live to do? 
 What have I left for you? 
 What will we leave behind? 
 What will you live to do? 
 What have I left for you? 
 What will we leave behind? 
 Night 
 Field of stars above us 
 I pick one and name it for you 
 And all who are to come

Walking, stumbling on these shadowfeet 
 Toward home, a land that I've never seen 
 I am changing: less and less asleep 
 Made of different stuff than when I began 
 And I have sensed it all along 
 Fast approaching is the day 
 When the world has fallen out from under me 
 I'll be found in you, still standing 
 When the sky rolls up and mountains fall on their knees 
 When time and space are through 
 I'll be found in you 
 There's distraction buzzing in my head 
 Saying in the shadows it's easier to stay 
 But I've heard rumors of true reality 
 Whispers of a well-lit way 
 When the world has fallen out from under me 
 I'll be found in you, still standing 
 When the sky rolls up and mountains fall on their knees 
 When time and space are through 
 I'll be found in you 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things 
 When the world has fallen out from under me 
 I'll be found in you, still standing 
 When the sky rolls up and mountains fall on their knees 
 When time and space are through 
 I'll be found in you 
 When the world has fallen out from under me 
 I'll be found in you, still standing 
 Every fear and accusation under my feet 
 When time and space are through 
 I'll be found in you 
 When time and space are through 
 I'll be found in you 
 I'll be found in you

Do-do do-do-do do-do-do-do-do 
 I wear a demeanor made of bright pretty things 
 What she wears, what she wears, what she wears 
 Birds singing on my shoulder in harmony it seems 
 How they sing, how they sing, how they sing 
 Give me nights of solitude, red wine, just a glass or two 
 Reclined in a hammock on a balmy evening 
 I'll pretend that it's no thing that skip in my heart when I think 
 Of you thinking of me, babe, I'm crazy over you 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water, something in the water 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water that makes me love you like 
 I've got halo's made of summer, ribbons made of spring 
 What she wears, what she wears, what she wears 
 I got crowns of words a-woven each one a song to sing 
 Oh I sing, oh I sing, oh I sing 
 Give me long days in the sun 
 Preludes to the nights to come 
 Previews of the mornings laying in all lazy 
 Give me something fun to do, like a life of loving you 
 Kiss me quick now, baby, I'm still crazy over you 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water, something in the water 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water that makes me love you like I do 
 Ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh 
 Ooh ooh ooh 
 Give me nights of solitude 
 Red wine just a glass or two 
 Give me something fun to do 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water, something in the water 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water that makes me love you like I do 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water, something in the water 
 Ah ah ah 
 There's something in the water that makes me love you like I

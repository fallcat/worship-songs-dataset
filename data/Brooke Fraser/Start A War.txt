I remember when we ruled the scene 
 Back when we reigned supreme 
 Black words in golden speech 
 The weapons in our reach 
 Tell me did I stutter? 
 Did you hear me right? 
 As the crowd begins to roar 
 Tell me where's the limit and I'll tell you why 
 You will be shaken by the sound 
 'Cause I'm gonna touch the sky 
 I'm damaging at my new discipline 
 I'm telling you 
 Can you smell the blood that's in the air 
 It's ours but we don't care 
 Burning the resistance to the ground 
 In line to claim your crown 
 Tell me did I stutter? 
 Did you hear me right? 
 As the crowd begins to roar 
 Tell me where's the limit and I'll tell you why 
 You will be shaken by the sound 
 'Cause I'm gonna touch the sky 
 I'm damaging at my new discipline 
 I'm telling you I'm gonna touch the sky 
 I'm falling out where I was falling in 
 I'm telling you I'm gonna touch the sky 
 If you're gonna start a war 
 You better know the choice you made is one worth fighting for 
 You can have your ground 
 'Cause when I touch the sky I'm taking everything you've got 
 Tell me did I stutter? 
 Did you hear me right? 
 As the crowd begins to roar 
 Tell me where's the limit and I'll tell you why 
 You will be shaken by the sound 
 'Cause I'm gonna touch the sky 
 I'm damaging at my new discipline 
 I'm telling you I'm gonna touch the sky 
 I'm falling out where I was falling in 
 I'm telling you I'm gonna touch the sky

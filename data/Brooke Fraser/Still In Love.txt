I'm not hangin' on your every word 
 I'm thrivin' on my self-sufficiency 
 I'm not listenin' to the things I've heard 
 About me and you 
 People think there must be somethin' to the way 
 I talk about you every chance I get 
 But if I think about you night and day 
 Doesn't mean I'm ready yet 
 Maybe I am knee deep in denial 
 Or maybe I'm just tryin' to move on-on 
 Maybe I should keep away awhile 
 But if distance is right, I'd rather be wrong 
 'Cause I love the way you're smiling at me 
 When you know it's true 
 I'm still in love with you 
 And I love the way you're really tryin' 
 Not to let me see 
 You're still in love with me too 
 I am way too proud to verbalise my feelings 
 And you are way too mean if you just let this brew 
 It's a complicated hand that you've been dealing 
 Time to win me over, fold and make your move 
 Smooth some calm over this situation 
 I can't get past the way I feel for you 
 It's the little things that make this worth the effort 
 It's the small little insignificant things you do 
 That make me love the way you're glancin' hopin' 
 When you know it's true 
 I'm still in love with you 
 And I love that I am barely coping 
 When you let me see 
 You're still in love with me too

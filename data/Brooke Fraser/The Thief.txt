Your eyes are full, full of the future of us 
 The air changes as you look across at me in that wondering way 
 It is as if I knew you before we spoke 
 Do our hearts know something we don't? 
 Conspiring, converging without giving us any say 
 You sing me to sleep, talk down my walls 
 Look through my windows as I wait 
 You could be the thief I'll give the key to 
 You're ruining me with secrets and gestures and looks 
 With sonnets in second-hand books 
 Playing the chords in me nobody knew how to play 
 You sing me to sleep, talk down my walls 
 Look through my windows as I wait 
 You could be the thief I'll give the key to 
 It fits in your hand like the water in rain 
 It unlocks our two different selves and shows we are the same 
 Rather than wait till I put me out for the taking 
 You're breaking 
 You're breaking into my heart and I'm letting you 
 Your eyes are full, full of the future of us

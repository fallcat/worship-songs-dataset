I appear in the wild 
 Hologram in the distance 
 I'm lighting up the bayou 
 We speak in storms 
 We're all electric, we're all electric 
 You're a fiend for a fight 
 You tend to misfire 
 Scorched earth, burnt skin 
 We speak storms 
 We're all electric, we're all electric 
 Thunder, thunder 
 Thunder, thunder 
 We are down to the wire 
 We're misconnecting 
 Combustible, explosive 
 Untamed 
 We're pyrotechnic, we're all electric 
 So we roll and we rage 
 Small scale destruction 
 Scorched earth, burnt skin 
 We're speaking storms 
 We're all electric 
 We're all electric 
 Thunder, thunder 
 Thunder, thunder 
 Air it bends (air it bends) 
 Then it breaks (then it breaks) 
 But we're holding our ground (hold our ground) 
 First the light (First the light) 
 First the light (First the light) 
 Then the sound 
 Thunder, thunder 
 Thunder, thunder

Don't you say it's too early 
 Baby I don't wanna waste the day 
 When we've everything on our side 
 And nothin' in our way 
 We can do what we wanna 
 'Cause today the world is ours 
 Nothing grey, just real time and colour 
 In which to whittle away the hours 
 We could speak till nothing's left unspoken 
 We could drive till we run out of road 
 We could drink till we've emptied the ocean 
 But I'd be happy here 
 Happy just to hold you 
 Till the suns and planets disappear 
 I could stay in your arms all year 
 Even if that means infinity through 
 If being productive is being with you 
 Then baby I don't want to waste another day 
 I'll shout aloud what I'm feeling 
 Let my tongue be still no more 
 Now I know that it's the real thing 
 Just try and keep me quiet about it oh-oh 
 'Cause we could stare till we both are blinded 
 We could fall till gravity gets tired 
 We could lose our love just to re-find it 
 But I'm just happy here 
 Happy staying beside you 
 Till the suns and planets disappear 
 I could stay in your arms all year 
 Even if that means infinity through 
 If being productive is being with you 
 Then baby I don't want to waste 
 Till the suns and planets disappear 
 I could stay in your arms all those years 
 Even if that means infinity through 
 If being productive is being with you 
 Then baby I don't want to waste another day

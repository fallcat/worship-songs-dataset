So we're back here again 
 Tiptoeing 'round the edge of the end 
 Wondering who will be last to admit 
 That we're finally over 
 Turned 21 on the day that we met 
 Terrible shoes, implausible dress 
 It's funny how sad the funny things get as you grow older 
 Better or worse 
 But what else can we do? 
 When better or worse 
 I am tethered to you 
 If it's not either of us 
 Tell me who are we fooling? 
 I learnt the art of biting my tongue 
 I tired of trying to guess what was wrong 
 Both agreed on where we should go 
 But not how to get there 
 We tried and tried to loosen the knots 
 Thinking once we're untangled we'll be better off 
 But it's these failures and faults that hold us together 
 Better or worse 
 But what else can we do? 
 When better or worse 
 I am tethered to you 
 If it's not either of us 
 Tell me who are we fooling? 
 This beautiful tangle that's bruising us blue 
 Is the beautiful knot that we just can't undo 
 Together we're one but apart tell me 
 Who are we fooling? 
 'Cause real love is hard love 
 It's all we have 
 It's a break neck 
 Train wreck 
 It's all we have 
 So we're back here again 
 Turning away from the edge of the end 
 Arm in arm 
 Better or worse 
 But what else can we do? 
 When better or worse 
 I am tethered to you 
 If it's not either of us 
 Tell me who are we fooling? 
 This beautiful tangle that's bruising us blue 
 Is the beautiful knot that we just can't undo 
 If it's not either of us 
 Tell me who are we fooling? 
 Together we're one but apart tell me 
 Who are we fooling?

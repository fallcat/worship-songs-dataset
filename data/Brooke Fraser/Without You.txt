The sky opens up 
 Over me and you 
 And you don't seem to mind 
 That we're soaked through 
 You kiss me in the rain 
 I forget what I'm moaning about 
 And I know I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 I laugh at my own jokes 
 And what I deem to be clever wit 
 And you don't seem to mind 
 That I'm so stupid 
 You kiss me once again 
 I forget what I'm babbling about 
 And I know I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 I couldn't replicate your touch 
 Or love anyone again this much 
 But I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 I wouldn't be the same 
 I wouldn't be the same 
 I wouldn't be the same 
 Without you 
 Without you yeah-yeah 
 Without you 
 Without you

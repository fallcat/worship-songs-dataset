I came upon a child of god 
 He was walking along the road 
 And I asked him, where are you going 
 And this he told me 
 I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm 
 I'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band 
 I'm going to camp out on the land 
 I'm going to try an' get my soul free 
 We are stardust 
 We are golden 
 And we've got to get ourselves 
 Back to the garden 
 Then can I walk beside you 
 I have come here to lose the smog 
 And I feel to be a cog in something turning 
 Well maybe it is just the time of year 
 Or maybe it's the time of man 
 I don't know who l am 
 But you know life is for learning 
 We are stardust 
 We are golden 
 And we've got to get ourselves 
 Back to the garden 
 By the time we got to Woodstock 
 We were half a million strong 
 And everywhere there was song and celebration 
 And I dreamed I saw the bombers 
 Riding shotgun in the sky 
 And they were turning into butterflies 
 Above our nation 
 We are stardust 
 Billion year old carbon 
 We are golden 
 Caught in the devil's bargain 
 And we've got to get ourselves 
 Back to the garden

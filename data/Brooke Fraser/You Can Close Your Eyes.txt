Well the sun is surely sinking down 
 But the moon is slowly rising 
 And this old world must still be spinning 'round 
 But I still love you 
 So close your eyes 
 You can close your eyes it's alright 
 I don't know no love songs 
 I can't sing the blues anymore 
 But I can sing this song 
 You can sing this song when I'm gone 
 It won't be long before another day 
 We're gonna have a good time 
 No one's gonna take that time away 
 You can stay as long as you like 
 So close your eyes 
 You can close your eyes it's alright 
 I don't know no love songs 
 I can't sing the blues anymore 
 But I can sing this song 
 You can sing this song when I'm gone

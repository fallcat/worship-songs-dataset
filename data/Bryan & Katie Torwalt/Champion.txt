Oh, victory, You have won 
 Victorious, You have come 
 What was stolen, You brought back to us 
 Oh, victory, You have won 
 Victorious, You have come 
 What was stolen, You brought back to us 
 Our champion, You fight for us 
 You made a way, where there was none 
 Our champion, You're strong in us 
 The debt we owed, You paid in blood 
 The one in whom we belong 
 We'll lift our voice, join His song 
 We were orphaned, now forever yours 
 Our champion, You fight for us 
 You made a way, where there was none 
 Our champion, You're strong in us 
 The debt we owed, You paid in blood 
 We will shout it out, from the mountain tops 
 That our God is good, He has overcome 
 Let all the earth, every tribe and tongue 
 We will sing it out, He has overcome 
 We will shout it out, from the mountain tops 
 That our God is good, He has overcome 
 Let all the earth, every tribe and tongue 
 We will sing it out, He has overcome 
 Our champion, You fight for us 
 You made a way, where there was none 
 Our champion, You're strong in us 
 The debt we owed, You paid in blood 
 Our champion, You fight for us 
 You made a way, where there was none 
 Our champion, You're strong in us 
 The debt we owed, You paid in blood

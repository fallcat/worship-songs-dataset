I feel the nations of the earth are shaking 
 There is no power that can match His grace 
 Lift up your head, lift up your eyes to see 
 All of creation is waiting and longing 
 For sons and daughters to declare this truth 
 Lift up your head, lift up your voice to sing 
 He is the light shining in the darkness 
 He is the hope, hope of all the nations 
 He is the light, He is the light 
 For all the world to see 
 I feel the faith across the earth is rising 
 We prophesy about His kingdom come 
 Just like heaven all across the earth 
 He is the light shining in the darkness 
 He is the hope, hope of all the nations 
 He is the light, He is the light 
 For all the world to see 
 He is the light shining in the darkness 
 He is the hope, hope of all the nations 
 He is the light, He is the light 
 For all the world to see 
 Great, great is the Lord 
 And praise His name 
 Praise His name 
 Great, great is the Lord 
 And praise His name 
 Praise His name 
 Great, great is the Lord 
 And praise His name 
 Praise His name 
 He is the light shining in the darkness 
 He is the hope, hope of all the nations 
 He is the light, He is the light 
 For all the world to see

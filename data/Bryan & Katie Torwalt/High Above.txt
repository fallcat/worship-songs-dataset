We turn our hearts, and fix our eyes 
 We welcome you, arms open wide 
 And feel, light of heaven 
 Let every soul, arise and wake 
 Lift a song, prepare the way 
 We feel, light of heaven 
 One heart, one voice 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 Our hope, our joy 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 High above 
 God, your light has come 
 Overwhelmed, we stand in awe 
 Words fall short, of all you are 
 Behold, the king of heaven 
 One heart, one voice 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 Our hope, our joy 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 High above 
 God, your light has come 
 Oh, the light has come 
 Oh, the king has come 
 Oh, the light has come 
 Oh, the king has come 
 One heart, one voice 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 Our hope, our joy 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 One heart, one voice 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 Our hope, our joy 
 We lift you up, we lift you up 
 High above 
 God, your light has come 
 Oh, you're high above 
 God, your light has come

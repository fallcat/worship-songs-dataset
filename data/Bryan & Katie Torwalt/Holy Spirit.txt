There's nothing worth more 
 That will ever come close 
 No thing can compare 
 You're our living hope 
 Your Presence 
 I've tasted and seen 
 Of the sweetest of love 
 Where my heart becomes free 
 And my shame is undone 
 Your Presence, Lord 
 Holy Spirit you are welcome here 
 Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere 
 Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for 
 To be overcome by your Presence, Lord 
 Oh God how we love your Presence 
 Let us become more aware of your Presence 
 Let us experience the glory of your goodness

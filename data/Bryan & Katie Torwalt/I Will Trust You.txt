Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil thing 
 In this life I have seen your faithfulness 
 In this life I have found your grace God 
 I will trust you 
 All my hope is found in your love 
 I will trust you 
 My whole life is found in your love 
 Though my eyes cannot see every single step 
 And my heart feels unsure again 
 I remember the strength of your love O God 
 I hold onto the peace you bring 
 I will trust you 
 All my hope is found in your love 
 I will trust you 
 My whole life is found in your love 
 I will trust you 
 All my hope is found in your love 
 I will trust you 
 My whole life is found... 
 And your goodness, kindness, faithfulness 
 Persists through the night 
 Your goodness, kindness, faithfulness 
 Persists through the night 
 Your goodness, kindness, faithfulness 
 Persists through the night 
 Your goodness, kindness, faithfulness 
 Persists through the night 
 I will trust you 
 All my hope is found in your love 
 I will trust you 
 My whole life is found in your love

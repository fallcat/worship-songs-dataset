Let this be a sacrifice 
 Let me dedicate my life 
 To worship You 
 I'm a lover of Your presence 
 I'm a lover of Your presence 
 I'm a lover of Your presence 
 A passion stirring deep inside 
 You're all that really satisfies 
 We worship You 
 We're lovers of Your presence 
 We're lovers of Your presence 
 We're lovers of Your presence 
 And that's all we want to be 
 I was made for love 
 I was made for love 
 I was made for loving You

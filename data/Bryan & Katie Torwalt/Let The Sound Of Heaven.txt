Let the sound of heaven ring out, join the songs of angels sung loud 
 Let all heaven and earth praise Your name Lord Jesus 
 Let the signs and wonders break out, let revival fire burn bright 
 Let all heaven and earth praise Your name Lord Jesus 
 Let Praise come from my lips all my days 
 Your love overtake me and flow through my veins 
 Let Heaven on earth be reality here 
 Let Your Kingdom come and Your glory dwell here 
 All my love and affection belongs to You

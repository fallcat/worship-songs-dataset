All depression washes away 
 On the shores of your great love 
 Let addiction and all shame 
 Be laid down at your feet 
 Come awake, awake my soul 
 I feel justice rising 
 Breathe new life into these bones 
 I can feel your heartbeat 
 Freedom take hold of my heart 
 Spirit of God come fill this place 
 Jesus, You're all that I want 
 Have Your way 
 And You bring peace in every storm 
 God, You are my anchor 
 A hope that's deep within my soul 
 Oh, the strength of your love 
 Tear down walls, tear down strongholds 
 That keep me back from you 
 Perfect love that's never ending 
 And leads me to all truth 
 Freedom take hold of my heart 
 Spirit of God come fill this place 
 Jesus, You're all that I want 
 Have Your way 
 All creation knows that You alone are God 
 As we sing your praises, let our hearts respond 
 (Repeat bridge) 
 Freedom take hold of my heart 
 Spirit of God come fill this place 
 Jesus, You're all that I want 
 Have Your way

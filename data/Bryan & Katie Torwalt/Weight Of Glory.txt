We have seen the way you move 
 Full of goodness, full of mercy 
 We can never get enough 
 O God of grace, great God of love 
 And let the weight of your glory 
 Come and settle on us now 
 We stand in awe for you are holy 
 And your kindness overwhelms 
 As we see your signs and wonders 
 Signs from heaven up above 
 You draw us in, you pull us closer 
 Into the depths of your great love 
 And let the weight of your glory 
 Come and settle on us now 
 We stand in awe for you are holy 
 And your kindness overwhelms 
 Let the weight of your glory 
 Come and settle on us now 
 We stand in awe for you are holy 
 And your kindness overwhelms 
 Be lifted up you heavenly gates 
 Be opened wide you ancient doors 
 Be lifted up you heavenly gates 
 Be opened wide you ancient doors 
 And let the weight of your glory 
 Come and settle on us now 
 We stand in awe for you are holy 
 And your kindness overwhelms

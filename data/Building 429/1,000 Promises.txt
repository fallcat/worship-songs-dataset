Wish that I could rewind me 
 Rewrite all my history 
 But You say that You knew each day 
 Before one came to be 
 Wish that there was a detour 
 From unfair, undone and unsure 
 But You say when I'm weak, You are strong 
 You never leave my side 
 I've got a thousand promises 
 I know You're not done yet 
 Every word that You've ever spoken 
 To the end won't be broken 
 I've got everything You've said 
 Reminding me again 
 You complete everything You start 
 Keep speaking to my heart 
 One thousand promises, one thousand promises 
 One thousand promises 
 Over and over 
 In the midst of the shadows 
 In the valley so low 
 I will not be afraid of the night 
 You are by my side 
 And when I can't see a way out 
 And I'm caught in a fight with my doubt 
 When it's not what I would have chosen 
 This hope I'm still holding 
 I've got a thousand promises 
 I know You're not done yet 
 Every word that You've ever spoken 
 To the end won't be broken 
 I've got everything You've said 
 Reminding me again 
 You complete everything You start 
 Keep speaking to my heart 
 One thousand promises, one thousand promises 
 One thousand promises 
 Over and over 
 You won't leave me, won't forsake me 
 Glory to glory You will take me 
 Out of ashes into beauty 
 You before, You behind me 
 As I wait, I know I'll rise up 
 On the wings of eagles, higher 
 I can do all things in You 
 I believe each word is true 
 I've got a thousand promises 
 This isn't where it ends 
 I know You're not done yet 
 I've got a thousand promises 
 I know You're not done yet 
 Every word that You've ever spoken 
 To the end won't be broken 
 I've got everything You've said 
 Reminding me again 
 You complete everything You start 
 Keep speaking to my heart 
 One thousand promises, one thousand promises 
 One thousand promises 
 Over and over 
 As I wait, I know I'll rise up 
 On the wings of eagles, higher 
 I can do all things in You 
 I believe each word is true

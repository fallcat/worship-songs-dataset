Oh I'm waiting for the answer to the question in my soul 
 Lord why did you lead me here? 
 I take a look around and a desperate world surrounds me 
 I know I'm not of this place, but its here and in my face 
 All that I am wants to run 
 God I feel hopeless and undone 
 Lift me up above it all 
 I'm feeling broken and alone 
 Don't let me turn to stone 
 Lift my heart above it all 
 I've lost my hope tonight 
 And I'm praying for the strength to carry on 
 Lord lift me above it all 
 Now I'm waiting for a glimpse of hope in an eye 
 But a flash of sunlight shows a faded gray 
 Cause these streets are hard and cold 
 And the alleys burn like coal with a stench of helplessness 
 And all the life that's been misspent 
 And all that I am wants to run 
 God I feel helpless and undone 
 Lift me up above it all 
 I'm feeling broken and alone 
 Don't let me turn to stone 
 Lift my heart above it all 
 I've lost my hope tonight 
 And I'm praying for the strength to carry on 
 Lord lift me above it all 
 Maybe I'm not supposed to fly 
 Maybe you want me here tonight 
 To lift them up above it all 
 When they're broken and alone 
 Don't let me turn to stone 
 Lift them up above it all 
 'Cause they cannot stand alone 
 And they're praying for the strength to carry on 
 Lift us up above it all 
 When we're broken and alone 
 Don't let us turn to stone 
 Lift us up above it all 
 Because we cannot stand alone 
 And we're praying for the strength to carry on 
 Lord will you lift us up above it all

Can you believe, that all this time has passed us 
 And all we were has left us, wishing we were there again 
 We're all older now, but we still fall down and scrape our knees 
 Well I can't believe that all these lines keep getting deeper 
 I watch children become fathers as their mothers weep 
 And I can see somehow, that it's all about here and now 
 But I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 Thank God I'm alive 
 You're speaking to me through the beauty of creation 
 From the highest elevation, to the depths of seas 
 So I'm not afraid to face this life of brevity 
 'Cause I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 I feel something rushing over me and I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 Thank God I'm alive 
 We're alive, to glorify 
 We're alive, to glorify 
 We're alive, to glorify, the maker of this life 
 We're alive, to glorify, the maker of this life

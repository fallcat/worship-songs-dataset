I'm tired from all I've held onto 
 Weighed down by all that isn't true 
 I'm bound by my failure 
 I'm weak from all I've tried to be 
 So far from ever being worthy 
 I'm going under 
 But you say 
 Let go 
 You buried my shame 
 You carried the weight of all my burdens 
 And all I'm holding now is you 
 You broke every chain 
 You lifted the weight of all my burdens 
 And all I'm holding now is you 
 If my world crashes to the sea 
 You're still everything I need 
 Oh god, help me to believe 
 When you say 
 Let go 
 You buried my shame 
 You carried the weight of all my burdens 
 And all I'm holding now is you 
 You broke every chain 
 You lifted the weight of all my burdens 
 And all I'm holding now is you 
 It's you 
 We're holding you 
 We're lifting empty hands to you 
 And it's you 
 We're holding you 
 We're lifting empty hands to you 
 You buried my shame 
 And carried the weight of all my burdens 
 And all I'm holding now is you 
 You broke every chain 
 You lifted the weight of all my burdens 
 And all I'm holding now is you 
 It's you 
 We're holding you 
 We're lifting empty hands to you 
 And it's you 
 We're holding you 
 We're lifting empty hands to you 
 To you

Turn my world upside down 
 Turn it all inside out 
 You take the least, and make them first 
 Pour yourself on those who thirst 
 You use us when we are weak 
 You use me because I am weak 
 Its here I find 
 You lift me up just to lift you high 
 This never was about me 
 You get all the glory 
 If I stand 
 It's only that I'm in your hands 
 It never was about me 
 You get all the glory 
 You're the author of it all 
 And so I live to make you known 
 You take the last, you take the low 
 You make something beautiful 
 You use me because I am weak 
 You're ways are higher 
 You're will above my own 
 Your glory is greater 
 You're story will be told

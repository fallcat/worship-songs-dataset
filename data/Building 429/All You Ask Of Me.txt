Somehow I always seem to do 
 The very thing I hate 
 And I can't find the strength to change 
 Feels like I'm getting in your way 
 And now I'm living with the pain 
 Of knowing that I let you down 
 Lord You, you've seen my darkest hour 
 Still you know my heart's desire 
 And I ... 
 I don't want to fall short of 
 All you've made me to be 
 And I... 
 I don't have to 'cause I know you 
 Made a way for me to be 
 All you ask of me 
 All You ask of me 
 Well, You don't see me as I am 
 I know you have a plan 
 To complete your work in me 
 You've gone and named me as your own 
 It's like a hope I've never known 
 Because you're mercy covers me 
 Lord You, you've seen my darkest hour 
 Still you know my heart's desire 
 I don't want to fall short of 
 All you've made me to be 
 And I... 
 I don't have to 'cause I know you 
 Made a way for me to be 
 All you ask of me 
 All You ask of me 
 There on Calvary you took the nail and thought of me 
 You bore the shame of fallen man 
 There on Calvary you paid my debt and set me free 
 And now I'm free to live again 
 I don't want to fall short of 
 All you've made me to be 
 And I... 
 I don't have to 'cause I know you 
 Made a way for me to be 
 I don't want to fall short of 
 All you've made me to be 
 And I... 
 I don't have to 'cause I know you 
 Made a way for me to be 
 All you ask of me 
 All You ask of me

I believed for so long 
 That I had to be strong 
 That it came down to me 
 I couldn't be weak 
 I couldn't be wrong 
 But I... I-I-I, I-I-I, I found a place 
 Where none of that matters 
 It's You 
 It's always and only been You 
 My shelter, my home and my refuge 
 The hope that I hold to 
 The strength that I run to 
 It's always only You 
 When my world starts to spin 
 And my knees start to bend 
 I know down to my core 
 You were faithful before 
 You'll be faithful again 
 It's You 
 It's always and only been You 
 My shelter, my home and my refuge 
 The hope that I hold to 
 The strength that I run to 
 It's always only You 
 All along You've been reaching 
 All along You've been singing over me 
 All along You've been speaking 
 Calling my name, calling my name 
 All along You've been reaching 
 All along You've been singing over me 
 All along You've been speaking 
 Calling my name, I hear You say... 
 It's You 
 It's always and only been You 
 There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
 I'm desperate to hold you 
 I died just to show you... 
 You 
 It's always and only been You 
 There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
 I'm desperate to hold you 
 I died just to show you 
 It's always only You 
 It's always only You

I was standing in the pouring rain 
 One dark November night 
 Fighting off the bitter cold 
 When she caught my eye 
 Her face was torn and her eyes were filled 
 And then to my surprise 
 She pulled out a photograph 
 And my heart just stopped inside 
 She said "He would have been three today 
 I miss his smile, I miss his face" 
 What was I supposed to say? 
 But I believe always always 
 Our Savior never fails 
 Even when all hope is gone 
 God knows our pain and His promise remains 
 He will be with you always 
 He was living in a broken world dreaming of a home 
 His heart was barely keeping pace 
 When I found him all alone 
 Remembering the way he felt 
 When his daddy said goodbye 
 Fighting just to keep the tears 
 And the anger locked inside 
 He's barely holding on to faith 
 But deliverance is on its way 
 'Cause I believe always always 
 Our Savior never fails 
 Even when all hope is gone 
 God knows our pain and His promise remains 
 He will be with you always 
 Friend I don't know where you are 
 And I don't know where you've been 
 Maybe you're fighting for your life 
 Or just about to throw the towel in 
 But if you're crying out for mercy 
 If there's no hope left at all 
 If you've given everything you've got 
 And you're still about to fall 
 Well hold on, hold on, hold on 
 'Cause I believe always always 
 Our Savior never fails 
 Even when all faith is gone 
 God knows our pain and His promise remains 
 Always, Always 
 He will be with you always 
 He will be with you always 
 He will be with you

Who am I, 23 and it's all a lie 
 I thought I knew who I was 
 I thought that You were here with me 
 But this darkness is breaking everything in me 
 These infinite questions have shattered all the peace 
 But I won't question in the dark 
 What is true out in the light 
 I will follow after You 
 Through the sun and through the night 
 Cause You've got me right where You want me 
 Yeah You've got me right where I need to be 
 And I'm standing amazed 
 Where did it go, 33 and it's gone so fast 
 Thought I knew who I was 
 I though that You were leading me 
 But this depression is crashing in on me 
 And I'm not half the man I hoped I'd be 
 But I won't question in the dark 
 What is true out in the light 
 I will follow after You 
 Through the storm and through the fight 
 Cause You've got me right where You want me 
 Yeah You've got me right where I need to be 
 And I'm standing amazed 
 But I won't question in the dark 
 What is true out in the light 
 I will follow after You 
 Through the storm and through the fight 
 Cause You've got me right where You want me 
 Yeah You've got me right where I need to be 
 And I'm standing amazed 
 You've got me right where I want to be 
 You've got me right where I need to be 
 And I'm standing amazed

You took the part, hoping that it would be your break 
 Then you prayed to God you'd say your lines right 
 You looked so nice, cause you covered your face with Maybelline 
 And hoped the light would make you shine 
 But you feel just like a puppet 
 Because they're pulling all your strings 
 And you've become the person you swore you'd never be 
 And then the sky opens up 
 And the angels float down 
 They're singing, Heaven cover Angeline tonight 
 And all over the Los Angeles 
 The lights are going down 
 And they're singing heaven cover Angeline tonight 
 So you ride the wave, cause everything is going fine today 
 Then you take a breath and wait for the next set 
 O you write your name, and you cover the phrases with your tears 
 Cause maybe the water will blur the truth out 
 And you say that you're a loner 
 But I know you hate to be alone 
 And you say that you can't take it 
 Not one more day, not one more day 
 Then the sky opens up 
 And the angels float down 
 They're singing, Heaven cover Angeline tonight 
 All over the Los Angeles 
 The lights are going down 
 And they're singing heaven cover Angeline tonight 
 O Look at you, you're perfection in the making 
 Just look at you, you're believing all they're saying 
 But you're gonna be fine tonight 
 When the sky opens up 
 And the angels float down 
 When the sky opens up 
 And the angels float down 
 When the sky opens up 
 And the angels float down 
 They're singing, Heaven cover Angeline tonight 
 All over the Los Angeles 
 The lights are going down 
 And they're singing heaven cover Angeline tonight 
 We'll be praying, Heaven cover Hollywood tonight

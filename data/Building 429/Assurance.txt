When skies grow dark I will not fear 
 This is the part where You draw near 
 The very place where light steps in 
 And works all things for good again 
 I have this assurance 
 Mountains are moving 
 Though I may not see 
 My heart will believe 
 In who You are 
 You're still my healer 
 Blessed redeemer 
 Beginning and end 
 My hope and defense 
 Is who You are 
 This battleground shall be the place 
 I find the power of endless praise 
 In every fight, I'll lift my hands 
 You'll work all things for good again 
 You'll work all things for good again 
 I have this assurance 
 Mountains are moving 
 Though I may not see 
 My heart will believe 
 In who You are 
 You're still my healer 
 Blessed redeemer 
 Beginning and end 
 My hope and defense 
 Is who You are 
 My trust and my confidence 
 They shall not be overwhelmed 
 Your power and Your faithfulness 
 They shall not be overwhelmed 
 I have this assurance 
 Mountains are moving 
 Though I may not see 
 My heart will believe 
 In who You are 
 You are my healer 
 My blessed redeemer 
 Beginning and end 
 My hope and defense 
 Is who You are 
 I have this assurance 
 I have this assurance

We are questions that beg for the answers 
 We are poems awaiting the rhyme 
 We are riddles that long for solution 
 With your breath we come alive 
 We are silenced when searching for reasons 
 We are weary and broken inside 
 We are desperate for your affection 
 We are darkness you are light 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 Stir in our hearts your truth 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 That we might live for you 
 We are ashes, we are dust 
 Awaken us 
 Lord, You whispered the dawn of creation 
 And your love has been on display 
 You have promised that you would be with us 
 We need you, here to day 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 Stir in our hearts your truth 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 That we might live for you 
 We are ashes, we are dust 
 Awaken us 
 You will lead us out of the desert 
 You will hold us when we are weak 
 Lord, we will rise up, we will rise up 
 To follow our Great King. 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 Stir in our hearts your truth 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 That we might live for you Oh 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 Stir in our hearts your truth 
 Awaken us, Awaken us 
 That we might live for you 
 We are ashes, we are dust 
 Awaken us Yeah 
 Awaken us Yeah 
 Awaken us Yeah 
 Awaken us Yeah

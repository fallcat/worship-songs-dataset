Tears burn like the flame of the fire 
 Words heart when they come from an empty heart 
 Then time stops like the hand of a broken clock 
 And everything that lit up your life is covered in the darkness 
 I know, I know 
 I feel your pain 
 I know, I know 
 When the world is closing in, you're breaking down 
 You're crying out but there is no answer 
 When you call, just close your eyes and know that 
 This twisted road eventually, is gonna lead you back to Me 
 Ice melts to reveal a frozen soul 
 And the water rises to new suffocating heights 
 And it feels like you're drowning in desperation 
 Cause everything that lit up your life has been covered in the darkness 
 I know I know 
 I feel your pain 
 I know I know, you know the way 
 When the world is closing in, you're breaking down 
 You're crying out but there is no answer 
 When you call, just close your eyes and know that 
 This twisted road eventually, is gonna lead you back to Me

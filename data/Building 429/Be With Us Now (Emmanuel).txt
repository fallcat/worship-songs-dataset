It's hard to understand this life we're living 
 More down than up, more lost than found these days 
 But everybody's searching for the reasons 
 But the pain, the shame, that just won't go away 
 If there's a miracle in Your plan 
 It's that we know we are in Your hands 
 Even when we don't understand 
 Be with us now 
 Be with us now 
 If You're strong enough to make us whole 
 Surely You could let us know 
 That You're with us now 
 Be with us now 
 If love can conquer every fear 
 Please wash away these tears 
 Be with us now 
 To help us to be faithful while we are waiting 
 When time goes by and nothing seems to change 
 'Cause Lord, we need Your hope, we need your healing 
 When we're falling apart with a broken hearts 
 We need You to show us the way 
 Be with us now 
 Be with us now 
 If You're strong enough to make us whole 
 Surely You could let us know 
 That You're with us now 
 Be with us now 
 If love can conquer every fear 
 Please wash away these tears 
 Emmanuel, God with us 
 Be with us now 
 Emmanuel, God with us 
 Be with us now 
 Be with me now, be with me now 
 If You're strong enough to make me whole 
 Surely You could let me know 
 Be with us now 
 Be with us now 
 If You're strong enough to make us whole 
 Surely You could let us know 
 That You're with us now 
 Be with us now 
 If love can conquer every fear 
 Please wash away these tears 
 Be with us now 
 Emmanuel 
 Be with us now

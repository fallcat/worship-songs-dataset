You ought to know that I am here (near) 
 You ought to know I'll be here to love you 
 Just to love you 
 Through all the pain and through the years 
 I'll be the one to dry your tears 
 I love you, I love you 
 Because you're mine 
 Child of mine I know that you're hurting 
 And I've seen you try to soldier on 
 I am here to lift away your burden 
 And I will hold you till the pain is gone 
 So today I promise forever 
 Tomorrow I'll say it again 
 You would give it all to know the answers 
 And I know you've heard this all before 
 I'm just here to help your heart remember 
 That no one else could ever love you more 
 So today I promise forever 
 Tomorrow, I'll say it again 
 So don't you ever doubt 
 You are my precious child 
 My glory in the making 
 The years will bring you many trials 
 But I will never let you down 
 I'm here with my arms open just waiting for

Most days I am a fool 
 Sometimes I play the king 
 Afraid that I'll get lost 
 In a place you cannot reach 
 Feel like I'm caving in 
 Rather quit than lose again 
 Your love surrounds me 
 Whether I may lose or win 
 This I know 
 You use the best 
 You use the worst 
 You use the joy 
 You use the hurt 
 I may be last 
 I may be first 
 But you use the best 
 You use the worst 
 My scars are not my shame 
 They are the memories 
 Moments when I lost faith 
 You came and healed me 
 The mountains in my way 
 The shadows hide your face 
 But you are for me 
 Yes you are with me 
 This I know 
 You use the best 
 You use the worst 
 You use the joy 
 You use the hurt 
 I may be last 
 I may be first 
 But you use the best 
 You use the worst 
 Win or lose I'll live for you 
 You use the blind and the vision 
 Dead and the living 
 Samson and thomas 
 Strength and the weakness 
 Blind and the vision 
 Dead and the living 
 Samson and thomas 
 Strength and my weakness 
 You use the best 
 You use the worst 
 You use the joy 
 You use the hurt 
 I may be last 
 I may be first 
 But you use the best 
 You use the worst 
 You use the best 
 The best and the worst of me 
 You use the best and the worst of me

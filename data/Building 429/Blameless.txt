I know exactly who I am 
 All of the places that I've been 
 I was just a mess before 
 Always wanting something more 
 I used to die inside my head 
 With all of my pain and my regret 
 Wanted to be someone else 
 Who did it right, and never fell 
 I'm not who I used to be 
 Blameless, you have made me blameless 
 Sin has been made nameless 
 Doesn't matter who I was before 
 I am 
 Shameless, you have made me shameless 
 Sin has been made nameless 
 Cause your love has come and left its mark 
 And I am blameless 
 I'll never change the man I was 
 But I believe grace because 
 Everything I tried to I hide 
 You took away and gave me life 
 I feel the healing of your hands 
 Was on my knees but now I stand 
 Finally I'm not ashamed 
 I've found the strength to face the day 
 I'm not who I used to be 
 Blameless, you have made me blameless 
 Sin has been made nameless 
 Doesn't matter who I was before 
 I am 
 Shameless, you have made me shameless 
 Sin has been made nameless 
 Cause your love has come and left its mark 
 And I am blameless 
 If only we could 
 Wake up, wake up, oh sleepers 
 We are children of our god 
 Lift up your eyes oh people 
 There is freedom in his arms 
 You are blameless, 
 You have been made blameless 
 Sin has been made nameless 
 Doesn't matter who you were before 
 You are shameless, you have been made shameless 
 Sin has been made nameless 
 Cause his love has come and left its mark 
 And we are blameless

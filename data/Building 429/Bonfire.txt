My mama always said I was born for this 
 And some people wouldn't like that I was different 
 It never really mattered how hard it would be 
 'Cause she filled me with love and the strength to lead. 
 She said, Ooohaaa 
 That kid's a flame 
 Said Ooha 
 That kid's a flame 
 He's gonna burn something down if you get in his way 
 I came to, light it up 
 Light it up, light it up 
 If I was born to be a flame 
 Then I wanna light a bonfire 
 Light it up, light it up, light it up 
 If I was born to be a flame 
 Then I wanna light a bonfire 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 I'm gonna burn something down if you get in my way 
 This is the shout out, this is my voice 
 Calling all the men, women, girls and boys 
 The dropouts, the losers, the hurt and the broke 
 Time to reclaim what the darkness has stole 
 Marching to the beat of a different drum 
 We live for the love without counting the cost 
 If you wanna be free then it's time to go 
 Lift up your hands so the world will know 
 We came to light it up 
 Light it up, light it up 
 If we were born to be a flame 
 Then we're gonna light a bonfire 
 Light it up, light it up, light it up 
 If we were born to be a flame 
 Then we're gonna light a bonfire 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 We're gonna burn something down if you get in our way 
 We are not meant to be silent 
 We are alive just to shine 
 We are not meant to be quiet 
 We are the light of the world 
 We gotta light, light, light it up 
 Ooohaaa 
 That kid's a flame 
 Said Ooha 
 That kid's a flame 
 He's gonna burn something down if you get in his way 
 We came to light it up 
 Light it up, light it up 
 If we were born to be a flame 
 Then we're gonna light a bonfire 
 Light it up, light it up, light it up 
 If we were born to be a flame 
 Then we're gonna light a bonfire 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 Let it burn, let it burn 
 We're gonna burn something down if you get in our way

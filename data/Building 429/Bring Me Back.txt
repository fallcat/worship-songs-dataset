I remember when 
 Time was always spent 
 Dreaming of tomorrow 
 The way that it would be 
 But we all had our hopes 
 We all made our plans 
 Somewhere along the way we lost our clarity 
 And nobody meant to change 
 We never thought we'd end up this far away 
 Bring me back to the innocence of You 
 And bring me back to the first love I ever knew 
 Back to the way when I was young 
 I'm tired of the mess that I've become 
 I want to see the world the way you do 
 So bring me back to You 
 Back to You 
 And as the days go by 
 I wish I could stop time 
 Because my little boy and girl 
 Their eyes are on the world 
 And what they've yet to learn 
 And what they've yet to see 
 Are the very things that jaded me 
 And left me empty 
 I never meant to change, no 
 I never meant to stray so far away 
 So bring me back to the innocence of You 
 And bring me back to the first love I ever knew 
 Back to the way when I was young 
 I'm tired of the mess that I've become 
 I want to see the world the way you do 
 Open my eyes, Lord, and help me to see 
 The plans that you have for me 
 And open my heart, fill it up, fill it up 
 And hold me, Lord, hold me 
 Bring me back to the innocence of You 
 And bring me back to the first love I ever knew 
 Back to the way when I was young 
 I'm tired of the mess that I've become 
 I want to see the world the way you do 
 So bring me back to You 
 Back to You 
 I remember when 
 Our time was always spent 
 Dreaming of tomorrow

(1... 2...) 
 I'm moving sideways to move forward 
 Another crevice in the road 
 Yeah and you see me walkin' alone 
 And you need me I'm right here I am 
 And I don't have to run but still I fall 
 And we run, no we don't know where we're going 
 And we hide, pray that you will look inside and see our hearts 
 Tear me down just to build me back again 
 I never was the best in this life 
 I never had all the answers 
 And you see me walkin' along 
 And you need me right here I am 
 And I don't have to crawl but still I fall 
 And we run, no we don't know where we're going 
 And we hide, pray that you will look inside and see our hearts 
 Tear me down just to build me up again 
 Yeah and all that we could want is to be just like you 
 Yeah and all that we could need is, is only you 
 And we run, no we don't know where we're going 
 And we hide, pray that you will look inside and see our hearts 
 And we run, no we don't know where we're going 
 And we hide, pray that you will look inside and see our hearts 
 Tear me down 
 And we run, no we don't know where we're going 
 And we hide, pray that you will look inside and see our heart 
 Tear me down just to build me up again

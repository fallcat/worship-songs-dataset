I'm facing doubt, I'm feeling fear 
 But I hold fast because You're near 
 You have promised, I believe 
 You're here with me 
 When the distance seems too far 
 And the journey feels too hard 
 I hear the whisper, like the wind 
 I'm here with You 
 There You are, there You are 
 Right where I am 
 There You are, there You are 
 Moving again 
 Closer, closer 
 You keep reaching, You pursue 
 There is nothing You won't do 
 I may be broken but I'm not lost 
 When I am at the cross 
 There You are, there You are 
 Right where I am 
 There You are, there You are 
 Moving again 
 Closer 
 There You are, there You are 
 Holding me up 
 There You are, there You are 
 More than enough 
 Closer, closer 
 Closer than my fears and my doubts 
 Closer than my tears as they fall down 
 Closer than the lies that I believed 
 There You are, closer to me 
 Closer (closer), closer (closer) 
 Oh, You're getting closer (closer), closer to me, oh! 
 There You are, there You are 
 Right where I am 
 There You are, there You are 
 Moving again 
 Closer 
 There You are, there You are 
 Holding me up 
 There You are, there You are 
 More than enough 
 Closer 
 You're holding me up 
 You are more than enough 
 Closer, closer 
 Closer, closer 
 Closer than the lies that I've believed 
 There You are, closer to me

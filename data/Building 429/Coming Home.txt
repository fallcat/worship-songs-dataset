I am on the edge looking at the empty spaces 
 Everywhere I go trying to fill the empty places 
 Every other road carrying me away to anger 
 And every destination 
 Was just another point of danger 
 So I'm coming home, coming home 
 There's nothing left to prove anymore 
 I'm coming home, coming home 
 So Father don't you close that door 
 Won't you wait for me 
 When the sun goes down 
 I'll be running straight to you 
 I'm coming home, coming home 
 Well here I am, I want to see that love 
 I want to see that look in your eyes 
 When I run into your arms 
 And leave that world behind 
 Forgetting every minute that I ever spent away 
 Forgetting every moment 
 That I ever caused you pain 
 So I'm coming home, coming home 
 There's nothing left to prove anymore 
 I'm coming home, coming home 
 So Father don't you close that door 
 Won't you wait for me when the sun goes down 
 I'll be running straight to you 
 I'm coming home, coming home 
 Tell me how could I have been so foolish 
 How could I have been so blind 
 And how could I have been so selfish 
 To the point where I nearly lost my mind 
 You were always standing there 
 And you were waiting, waiting just for me 
 So I'm coming home 
 So I'm coming home 
 Won't you wait for me 
 When the sun goes down 
 I'll be running straight to you 
 I'm coming home 
 I'm coming home, I'm coming home 
 There's nothing left to prove anymore 
 I'm coming home, I'm coming home 
 So Father don't you close that door 
 Won't you wait for me 
 When the sun goes down 
 I'll be running straight to you 
 I'm coming home 
 I'm coming home

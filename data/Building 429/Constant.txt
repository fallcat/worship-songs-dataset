I can't live without You 
 I can't live without You 
 I can't live... 
 The light is gone the darkness has covered me 
 The moon is hidden and my eyes don't see 
 Still I follow, still I follow 
 Beautiful is love revealed to me 
 Through the depths of my desparity 
 Even when I'm shattering I know that 
 You've got me, yeah You've got me 
 When everything else is changing, You are constant 
 Lifting my eyes to see far beyond this misery 
 I am consumed with You 
 I can't live without You, breathe without You 
 I must confess to You that 
 I can't live without You, breathe without Your love 
 Perfectly ordained and formed with love 
 My heart has been designed for Your touch 
 So I will follow, I will follow 
 Stunning is Your glory revealing 
 The hope that lives deep inside of me 
 And I know that You have captured me 
 You've got me, yeah You've got me 
 When everything else is changing, You are constant 
 Lifting my eyes to see far beyond this misery 
 I am consumed with You 
 I can't live without You, breathe without You 
 I must confess to You that 
 I can't live without You, breathe without Your love

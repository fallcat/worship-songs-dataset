And I got time and I got money, 
 I taste the nougat I taste the honey 
 I just wanna know, what can You do for me? 
 Yeah 'cause I need love, I need affection 
 I need reality's connection 
 One more time would You show me that You're there 
 Because I believe that You can see 
 When my heart is cryin out 
 And that's why I can see, that it's up to me, 
 That's why love is my choice right now 
 Yeah, well one life you've got to live, 
 One life you've got to give 
 That's why we gotta give it everything we've got 
 Yeah, well one thing You came and died, 
 And one thing that we can't deny, 
 That Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life 
 Yeah and I believe that You can see 
 When my heart is cryin out 
 Yeah and that's why I can see, that it's up to me, 
 That's why love is my choice right now 
 Yeah and if these walls are big enough to hold me, 
 One thing you know I'm gonna break 'em all down 
 Yeah and everything is what I've got, 
 And everything is what I need 
 One day I'm gonna bring it down back to You 
 Yeah and I believe that You can see 
 When my heart is cryin out 
 Yeah and that's why I can see, that it's up to me, 
 That's why love is my choice 
 O yeah and I believe that You can see 
 When my heart is cryin out 
 O Yeah and that's why I can see, that it's up to me, 
 That's why love is my choice 
 Love is my choice, O yeah love is my choice, 
 Love is my choice right now

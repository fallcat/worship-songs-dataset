I see your doubt trying to silence the dream 
 I see your fear runnin' wild in the streets 
 And everybody's getting lost in the struggle now 
 Where are the ones who believe? 
 Somebody grab a match and light this fuse, oh 
 Gonna set it off until we see you explode 
 Let it be the jump start to the lost and weary heart 
 Then he said let's go 
 I wanna be a sky scraper 
 Reachin' for You 
 Reachin' for You 
 I wanna be a earth shaker, be the game changer 
 That's living for You 
 This is the moment the here and the now 
 We got a choice to step up or step down 
 What are you gonna do when its staring back at you? 
 This is the time to step out 
 Gonna set it off until we see you explode 
 Then he said let's go 
 I wanna be a sky scraper 
 Reachin' for You 
 Reachin' for You 
 I wanna be a earth shaker, be the game changer 
 That's living for you 
 When you're alone 
 When you're life 
 Will be the change, will be the light 
 Lift your name, lift above 
 Will be the change, will be the light 
 Oh oh 
 (Will be the change, will be the light) 
 Oh oh 
 I wanna be a sky scraper 
 Reachin' for You 
 Reachin' for You 
 I wanna be a earth shaker, be the game changer 
 That's living for you 
 I wanna be a sky scraper 
 Reachin' for You 
 Reachin' for You 
 I wanna be a earth shaker, be the game changer 
 That's living for you 
 I wanna be a Earth Shaker

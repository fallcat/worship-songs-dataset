I know what lives inside 
 When I hide far behind 
 The eyes that are so bright 
 Wanting our worlds to coincide 
 I know how much it costs 
 To fall prey, to be one lost 
 But I'll give my heart wholly 
 Even if I fall to the lies 
 I'll find peace with you again 
 When I'm holding out my sinful hands 
 Delivered and captured again 
 Though I was living like an empty man 
 You're washing me, while you're leading me home again 
 I know the soul of me 
 And everything that tempts me 
 So I guard my heart closely 
 I won't be falling for the lies 
 'Cause I found peace with you again 
 When I was holding out my sinful hands 
 Delivered and captured again 
 Though I was living like an empty man 
 You're still teaching me, as your leading me to the end 
 But the world 
 Would love me to believe 
 That it revolves around me 
 I can finally see 
 That the world 
 Would love to captivate 
 A childlike heart that aches 
 To fill the empty space 
 But I've found peace with you again 
 Though I'm holding out my sinful hands 
 Delivered and captured again 
 Though I was living like an empty man 
 You'll be washing me, as you're leading me to the end

I was the one to call the shots 
 Dream my dreams hard and slow 
 Answered only to my self 
 Never giving up control 
 Until the one day that brought me to my knees 
 And I would never be the same 
 Once upon a time the story goes 
 I laid it all down and let it go 
 To lose it all, to lose it all 
 It took a step of faith to say goodbye 
 And everything I had I left behind 
 To find true life 
 Well all I longed for I found finally 
 At the end of me 
 And now are gone those wasted days 
 The selfish soul the emptiness 
 Love had dimly been replaced 
 But that old life is laid to rest 
 And now the new me is stronger day by day 
 And I will never be the same 
 Once upon a time the story goes 
 I laid it all down and let it go 
 To lose it all, just to lose it all 
 I took a step of faith and said goodbye 
 And everything I had I left behind 
 To find true life 
 Well all I longed for I found finally 
 At the end of me 
 And like an answer to a prayer 
 Jesus you were there 
 Calling me to live, to die 
 To give to gain 
 And I'll never be the same 
 Once upon a time the story goes 
 I laid it all down and let it go 
 To lose it all, to lose it all 
 I took a step of faith and said goodbye 
 And everything I had I left behind 
 To find true life 
 Well all I longed for I found finally 
 At the end of me 
 It's the end of me

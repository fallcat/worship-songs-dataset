You will be in my heart forever 
 You will be with me, close as a dream 
 There'll be no faded memories 
 That will never be you and me 
 'Cause I know you'll be standing here tomorrow 
 Every moment with you I cherish 
 Every blessing poured out it echoes of Your love 
 You always take me higher than 
 The sorrow of this fallen man 
 And if I should ever lose my way 
 I can always go back to the place of you and me 
 And I will find you once again 
 Just like I remember 
 Time will erase the world around us 
 I will never be alone 
 'Cause time can't erase love, no 
 Your voice is music to my heart 
 You always sing to me just like a prayer 
 When the walls of my mind are caving in 
 I can hear you whispering 
 And I am taken away 
 I can always go back to the place of you and me 
 And I will find you once again 
 Just like I remember 
 Time will erase the world around us 
 I will never be alone 
 'Cause time can't erase love, no 
 Even if the sky falls down 
 We will have our place 
 That time can't take away, no 
 That time can't take away 
 I can always go back to the place of you and me 
 And I will find you once again 
 Just like I remember 
 Time will erase the world around us 
 But I will never be alone 
 'Cause time can't erase love 
 No it can't erase love, no

Everyday is an uphill climb 
 We're pushing harder just to fall behind 
 But we know the best is up ahead 
 Weary soul just rest your mind 
 You're gonna see it's just a matter of time 
 'Cause we got a God that's bigger yet 
 And the world is still in His hands 
 Even when we don't, even when we don't understand 
 You gotta keep your eyes up 
 Come on keep your eyes up 
 You and I will be all right, be all right 
 God is always on our side, on our side 
 Head up, don't you ever let up 
 All your broken and all your mess 
 Lay it in the hands of His faithfulness 
 Eyes up 
 Yeah, we're gonna rise up 
 Rise up 
 Come on keep your eyes up, eyes up 
 Every mountain seems so high 
 You're gonna see it from the other side 
 How big a God we really have 
 His love is deeper than the ocean, ocean wide 
 Maker of the stars that fill the skies 
 How big a God we really have 
 You gotta keep your eyes up 
 Come on keep your eyes up 
 You and I will be all right, be all right 
 God is always on our side, on our side 
 Head up, don't you ever let up

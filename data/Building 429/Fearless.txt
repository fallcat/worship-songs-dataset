I don't understand 
 No I can't comprehend 
 This power that draws me to you 
 But I know for the cross 
 Ill consider all lost 
 In an effort to tell of the truth 
 That the world may know 
 That the world may know 
 That you have been heaven sent to us 
 That the world may see 
 That the captives are free 
 For you have been heaven sent to us 
 I'll be fearless for You 
 I'll be fearless for You 
 Take me I'm Yours 
 I'll be fearless for You 
 All the times that I've failed 
 When my doubt has prevailed 
 These are the moments I'm giving to you 
 'Cause I can't be ashamed 
 No I can't fear the pain 
 When it comes time to be living proof 
 So the world may see 
 That the captives are freed 
 Cause you have been heaven sent to us 
 Unwilling to bend 
 Unwilling to break 
 Headstrong Ill stand 
 No matter what it takes

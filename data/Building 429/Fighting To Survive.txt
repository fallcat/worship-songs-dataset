Crying on the inside and it cuts me deep 
 'Cause I know you're gonna smile when I fall 
 I can't help but feel the fear when I'm standing here 
 'Cause I know you're gonna laugh if I have to crawl 
 Can you see the desperation? But you don't know my situation 
 'Cause I, I'm fighting to survive 
 Can't you see it in my eyes? 
 Please don't push me anymore 
 But I, I'm still fighting to believe 
 That there is hope for me 
 Somewhere beneath the very least of these 
 And I can't help but feel ashamed when I know the truth 
 That there was more than I surmised inside your heart 
 I want to make it go away but you bear the proof 
 My words burnt through your skin and left you scarred 
 I didn't see the desperation; somehow I didn't see your situation 
 Because I've been fighting to survive 
 I didn't see it in your eyes 
 But I won't hurt you anymore 
 And I, I'm fighting to believe 
 That there is hope for me 
 Somewhere beneath the least of these

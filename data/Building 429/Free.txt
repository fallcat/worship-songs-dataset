Whatever You want 
 Whatever You need 
 I want to be the one to give 
 Everything of me 
 So I'll strive to live worthy of Your calling 
 When I fall I know that You'll will love me 
 And I'm free 
 Cause after all that's come and gone 
 I know that You'll be holding on to me 
 And I believe 
 That when I'm feeling all alone 
 That's when I'll be leaning on Your love 
 I still break down 
 When I'm paralyzed with fear 
 But I hold onto the words I've read 
 And listen for Your voice that calls me near 
 Cause all that makes me who I am to be 
 Is everything in You that I still need 
 It's a long road left for me to make it home 
 But I don't go alone 
 Yeah, Yeah 
 And I'm free 
 Cause after all that's come and gone 
 I know that You'll be holding on to me 
 And I believe 
 That when I'm feeling all alone 
 That's when I'll be leaning on Your love 
 'Cause all that makes me who I am to be 
 Is everything in You that I still need 
 And It's a long road left for me to make it home 
 But I don't go alone 
 'Cause I'm 
 Free 
 Cause after all that's come and gone 
 I know that You'll be holding on to me 
 And I believe 
 That when I'm feeling all alone 
 That's when I'll be leaning on Your love 
 Yeah, Yeah

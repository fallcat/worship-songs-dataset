Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 I used to live my life for me 
 I was never down on my knees 
 I went to church just to sit in the seats 
 I used to love to do nothing 
 Salvation got a hold of me 
 I was broken down and hurting 
 Redemption came as a wave of relief 
 But then it followed with a burden 
 Thought that I would be living easy 
 'Til I finally heard the words You were speaking 
 "If you're Mine you will shine!" 
 So it's time to get up 
 I'm sick of just sitting around, yeah 
 It's time to get up 
 I'm listening to the sound, yeah 
 It's time to get up 
 'Cause all the people on the mezzanine floor 
 We can't forget what we were made for 
 Because our hands were made for reaching out, yeah 
 So it's time to get up 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 Maybe you've been just like me 
 Naked, blind, unaware, unseen 
 Maybe you've been living for peace 
 For no one but yourself 
 A lot to do and the workers are few 
 He's speaking to me and He's speaking to you 
 He saying "If you're Mine you will shine!" 
 So it's time to get up 
 I'm sick of just sitting around, yeah 
 It's time to get up 
 I'm listening to the sound, yeah 
 It's time to get up 
 'Cause all the people on the mezzanine floor 
 We can't forget what we were made for 
 Because our hands were made for reaching out, yeah 
 So it's time to get up 
 Hey, hey, you need to know that 
 We're not afraid to show them 
 The Good News so the world will, no doubt 
 Shout with the prodigal son! 
 Hey, hey, you need to know that 
 We're not afraid to show them 
 The Good News so the world will, no doubt 
 Shout with the prodigal son! 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh 
 So it's time to get up 
 I'm sick of just sitting around, yeah 
 It's time to get up 
 I'm listening to the sound, yeah 
 It's time to get up 
 'Cause all the people on the mezzanine floor 
 We can't forget what we were made for 
 Because our hands were made for reaching out, yeah 
 So it's time to get up 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

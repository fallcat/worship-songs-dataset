There's always a better way 
 There's always a bridge that needs crossing 
 There's always the straight and the narrow 
 The wide and the shallow 
 But I know that you're guiding me 
 And the best is yet to come 
 You've given me hope for tomorrow 
 And I know some day 
 I'll wake up to find 
 Your glory defined 
 And I will finally bow at your feet 
 I will lift up your name in honor and praise 
 When I cross over Jordan 
 I know that I'll be running home to you 
 It's always the simple things 
 It's always the obvious that crashes over me 
 It's always in front of me 
 It helps me to remember 
 This is what I live for 
 And I can't wait 
 Till I wake up to find 
 Your glory defined 
 And I will finally bow at your feet 
 I will lift up your name in honor and praise 
 When I cross over Jordan 
 I know that I'll be running home to you 
 There's never a question in your message 
 Never a moment without your presence 
 There's never a doubt in my mind 
 That I'll 
 Wake up to find 
 Your glory defined 
 And I will finally bow at your feet 
 I will lift up your name in honor and praise 
 When I cross over Jordan 
 I know that I'll be running home to you

I'm listening it all 
 To whispers still and small 
 Would I come when you call 
 And get up and go? 
 What would I even do 
 If I heard from you 
 I'm ready to move 
 You, I believe that you see 
 In me your hands and your feet 
 I'm picking up my cross 
 I'm gonna walk the talk 
 Cause Lord I finally know 
 If you say go 
 I'll never say no 
 I'll never say, never say, never say no 
 I'll get up and go 
 I will get up and I'll go 
 I will get up and I'll go 
 So stop me in my tracks 
 Don't let me get attached 
 To things that never last 
 'Cause I want more 
 To see your kingdom come 
 And hear You say "Well done" 
 Cause Lord I finally know 
 If you say go 
 I'll never say no 
 I'll never say, never say, never say no 
 I'll get up and go 
 I will get up and I'll go 
 I will get up and I'll go 
 (Go) 
 (Go) to the lost and the hopeless 
 (Go) through the doors You have opened 
 (Go) speak the words you have spoken 
 (Go) that the world may know 
 (Go) to the lost and the hopeless 
 (Go) through the doors You have opened 
 (Go) speak the words you have spoken 
 (Go) that the world may know 
 That the world may know 
 I will go 
 That the world may know 
 I will go 
 I'll never say no 
 I'll never say, never say, never say no 
 I'll get up and go 
 I will get up and I'll go 
 I will get up and I'll go

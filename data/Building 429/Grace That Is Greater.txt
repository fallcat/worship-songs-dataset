Search me O God 
 And know my every thought 
 Discern my every way 
 And speak into my soul 
 Point out to me my wrongs 
 Convict me until 
 I follow down the path 
 That leads me to your will 
 Because my heart 
 Sometimes can wander 
 And my faith 
 At times can stray 
 But I know 
 That when I fix my eyes on You 
 That I will always remain 
 Safe in the shadows of Your 
 Grace, grace 
 God's grace 
 Grace that will pardon 
 And cleanse within 
 Grace, grace 
 God's grace 
 Grace that is greater 
 Than all my sin 
 I praise You because 
 I am fearfully made 
 You formed my frame 
 In a secret place 
 All of my days 
 Ordained before I breathed 
 Written in Your book 
 Before I came to be 
 Because Your love 
 I stand and wonder 
 You know I come to Thee 
 And knowing that 
 When I fix my eyes on You 
 That I will always remain 
 Safe in the shadow of Your 
 Grace, grace 
 God's grace 
 Grace that will pardon 
 And cleanse within 
 Grace, grace 
 God's grace 
 Grace that is greater 
 Than all my sin 
 God's grace 
 Grace that will pardon 
 And cleanse within 
 Grace, grace 
 God's grace 
 Grace that is greater 
 Than all my sin 
 Grace that will pardon 
 And cleanse within 
 Grace, grace 
 God's grace 
 Grace that is greater 
 Than all my sin 
 Grace that is greater 
 Than all my sin 
 Is greater than all my sin 
 Is greater than all my sin 
 Is greater than all my sin

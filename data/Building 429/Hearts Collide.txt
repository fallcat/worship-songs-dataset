Stars go dim 
 The sun will descend 
 The kingdoms will end 
 But we will not we will not bend 
 Shadows will fall 
 Darkness surrounds us all 
 We will wait for the dawn 
 But we will not we will not crawl 
 This hour 
 This moment 
 We gotta rise up and own it 
 Hearts collide 
 Like sparks in the night 
 Gotta show 'em what we're made of 
 (Show 'em what we're made of) 
 Show 'em what we're made of 
 You and I 
 Like fire in the sky 
 Gotta show 'em what we're made of 
 (Show 'em what we're made of) 
 There's nothing were afraid of 
 Show 'em what we're made of 
 One for all 
 Even up against the wall 
 We will answer the call 
 We'll never back, never back off 
 This hour 
 This moment 
 We gotta rise up and own it 
 Hearts collide 
 Like sparks in the night 
 Gotta show 'em what we're made of 
 (Show 'em what we're made of) 
 Show 'em what we're made of 
 You and I 
 Like fire in the sky 
 Gotta show 'em what we're made of 
 (Show 'em what we're made of) 
 There's nothing we're afraid of 
 Show 'em what we're made of 
 Show 'em what we're made of 
 Oh no we'll never bow love 
 (Gotta shout it gotta let it out let it out) 
 Oh no we'll never bow love 
 (Gotta shout it gotta let it out let it out) 
 Can't silence our love 
 Can't silence our love 
 Can't silence our love 
 Can't silence our love 
 Hearts collide 
 Like sparks in the night 
 Gotta show 'em what we're made of 
 (Show 'em what we're made of) 
 You and I 
 Like fire in the sky 
 Gotta show 'em what we're made of 
 (Show 'em what we're made of) 
 There's nothing we're afraid of 
 (Show 'em what we're made of) 
 (Show 'em what we're made of)

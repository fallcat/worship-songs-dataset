I know I shouldn't want 
 Any more than what I've got 
 When I think about what's missing 
 Seems like a lot 
 But then I looked into their eyes 
 And see my children smile 
 I realize what I've been given 
 I have more than I have not 
 Where I am today 
 Didn't happen by mistake 
 You're brought me here 
 Where I'm supposed to be 
 Time will sleep away 
 But God don't let me waste 
 A second of today 
 Not a second, one second 
 I'm gonna hold them close 
 Every memory, every little bit 
 And I won't let go 
 Everything I need is right in front of me 
 You've given me what matters the most 
 So let me hold them close 
 I feel the grace of God 
 When my wife is by my side 
 A treasure I could never earn 
 No matter how hard I try 
 I take a look at the past 
 That brought us where we are 
 All I see is your faithfulness 
 That's carried us this far 
 Time will sleep away 
 I'm so thankful for today 
 So God don't let me waste 
 One second, not a second 
 I'm gonna hold them close 
 Every memory, every little bit 
 And I won't let go 
 Everything I need is right in front of me 
 You've given me what matters the most 
 So let me hold them close 
 So let me hold them close 
 Everything that you have done 
 Everything you're given us 
 Every good from you 
 Gonna hold them close 
 Everything that you have done 
 Everything you're given us 
 Every gift from you 
 Gonna hold them close 
 I'm gonna hold them close 
 Every memory, every little bit 
 And I won't let go 
 Everything I need is right in front of me 
 You've given me what matters the most 
 So let me hold them close 
 Let me hold them close

Its written in your eyes 
 I can see the face you hide 
 It's getting harder every night 
 To want to be alive 
 Thinking thoughts inside your mind 
 Of leaving us all behind 
 Leaving us all behind 
 But you're not quite home yet 
 You're not quite through 
 It's not your time 
 Hes got a plan for you 
 There's still a plan for you 
 Its everywhere you hide 
 Cause the shadows follow you 
 You think you can't escape 
 But you're running anyway 
 And you're thoughts all break my heart 
 There's a chapter left to write 
 There's a chapter left to write 
 Wont you run, fly open up your lungs tonight, breathe freedom for the first time in your life 
 Wont you run, fly, open up your lungs tonight, breathe freedom for the first time in your life

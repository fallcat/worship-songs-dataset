Walk blindly to the light and reach out for His hand 
 Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand 
 Open up your mind and then open up your heart 
 You will see that you and me we aren't very far apart 
 'Cause I believe that love is the answer 
 I believe love will find a way 
 I believe love is the answer 
 I believe love will find a way 
 Violence has spread worldwide and there's families on the streets 
 We sell drugs to children now, well why can't we just see 
 That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today 
 Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay 
 I believe that love is the answer 
 I believe love will find a way 
 I believe love is the answer 
 I believe love will find a way 
 Walk blindly to the light and reach out for His hand 
 Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand

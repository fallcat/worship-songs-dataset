I stand astounded by your unfailing love 
 Your grace imparted rings freedom in my soul 
 So I lift a voice to reach into the heavens 
 Trying to find a way to say how much I love You 
 Because 
 You spoke my world into existence 
 Designed my soul and mind even knowing 
 That I would be the one to break your heart 
 But you sent your only son to be a savior 
 You sent the living king to be a servant 
 And bought me with a price I can't imagine 
 So I belong to You 
 So let the world crash down all around me 
 I'm not affected by the words that they spew/use 
 I only live to sing, praises to my king 
 I only live to prove, I adore You 
 Because

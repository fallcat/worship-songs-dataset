Call me a renegade, 'cause I'm not afraid 
 To defend this faith I've had since I was fifteen 
 And it changed me, and it put this fire inside of me but... 
 Wave after wave the world tries to kill the flame 
 This is my anthem, I'm not ashamed to say 
 That I still believe 
 In a God who moves, in a God who still redeeems 
 And His love holds on like gravity 
 This is my gospel, I'm not ashamed about it 
 Give me a megaphone, I'm not afraid to shout it 
 That I still believe 
 Call me a radical, fanatical 
 But I was a dead man rescued by the supernatural 
 It's a miracle, how He breathed new life into these bones 
 Hope lit the spark and love turned it to a flame 
 This is my anthem, I'm not afraid to say 
 I still believe 
 In a God who moves, in a God who still redeeems 
 And His love holds on like gravity 
 This is my gospel, I'm not ashamed about it 
 Give me a megaphone, I'm not afraid to shout it 
 I still believe 
 But I still believe 
 Open your eyes 
 We believe in one Lord 
 Jesus Christ, the only Son of God 
 True God from True God, Light from Light 
 For our sake, He was crucified and buried 
 But on the third day, He rose again 
 I still believe 
 In a God who moves, in a God who still redeeems 
 And His love holds on like gravity 
 This is my gospel, I'm not ashamed about it 
 Give me a megaphone, I'm not afraid to shout it 
 I still believe 
 You're still moving, I can prove it 
 'Cause Your love's still moving me 
 I still believe 
 You're still moving, I can prove it 
 'Cause Your love's still moving me 
 I still believe 
 You're still moving, I can prove it 
 'Cause Your love's still moving me

You got a vision, you got a dream 
 But it feels a million miles away (hey!) 
 You got your passion, you got to believe 
 That this is why you were made 
 It takes a little time, takes a little time 
 It takes a little time to see 
 I said it takes a little time, takes a little time 
 It takes a little time to believe 
 You can rise above the typical, and be anything but usual 
 We know, we know, we know 
 That there's no such thing as impossible 
 And nothing is unreachable, when we trust the God of miracles 
 We know, we know, we know 
 That there's no such thing as impossible! 
 Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh (hey!) (hey!) 
 Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Oh 
 We're never given the spirit of fear 
 Only the power of love (hey!) 
 We'll keep on running, and not grow weak 
 His strength is more than enough (hey!) 
 It takes a little time, takes a little time 
 It takes a little time to see 
 I said it takes a little time, takes a little time 
 It takes a little time to believe 
 You can rise above the typical, and be anything but usual 
 We know, we know, we know 
 That there's no such thing as impossible 
 And nothing is unreachable, when we trust the God of miracles 
 We know, we know, we know 
 That there's no such thing as impossible! 
 Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh (hey!) 
 Oh 
 There is no such, no such thing 
 There is no such, no such thing 
 There is no such, no such thing 
 As impossible, impossible 
 There is no such, no such thing 
 There is no such, no such thing 
 There is no such, no such thing 
 As impossible, impossible 
 You can rise above the typical, and be anything but usual 
 We know, we know, we know 
 That there's no such thing as impossible 
 And nothing is unreachable, when we trust the God of miracles 
 We know, we know, we know 
 That there's no such thing as impossible! 
 Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh! (hey!) (hey!) 
 Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh! 
 Oh

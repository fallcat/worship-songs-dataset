You made the sun 
 And the moon and the stars 
 And the wind and the fire and the rain 
 It's so beautiful 
 And you saved my soul 
 Gave me hope in the midst of the joy and the pain 
 And I know 
 It's incredible 
 And I don't understand how it came to be 
 That your glorious love is alive in me 
 It doesn't matter how long I've got to live 
 I'm gonna praise you with every single breath 
 Doesn't matter how far I've got to go 
 I'm gonna follow you until you lead me home 
 And this is our song 
 And it's rising to meet your embrace as we're giving you praise 
 Incredible 
 And this is our song 
 And all of the people in heaven and earth proclaim 
 That you are God 
 And your glorious love is alive in me 
 'Cause your love is incredible 
 Father my redeemer 
 You are holy 
 You are merciful 
 Jesus you're my healer 
 You're my savior forever 
 Forever 
 Doesn't matter how far I've got to go 
 Gonna follow you until you lead me home 
 Cause your love is incredible 
 Your love is incredible x2

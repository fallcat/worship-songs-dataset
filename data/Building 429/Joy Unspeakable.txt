Healing hasn't come just yet 
 But I believe that I'm still in Your hands 
 I didn't really ask for this 
 But You're bigger than my circumstance 
 Greater than this hurt and pain 
 Greater still is Your name 
 I know, I know 
 I've got... 
 These hands high in the battle 
 I believe even in the shadows 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me 
 Gonna trust every word You've spoken 
 I will have no other hope and 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me 
 So many days when I just cannot see 
 How You're moving or what You're doing 
 I know it's clear to You and it's dark to me 
 So I will follow wherever You're going 
 I've got... 
 These hands high in the battle 
 I believe even in the shadows 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me 
 Gonna trust every word You've spoken 
 I will have no other hope and 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me... 
 You've got new mercies in the morning 
 Oh, I never walk alone 
 You will always lead me on 
 I said You've got new mercies in the morning 
 It's joy unspeakable 
 These hands high in the battle 
 I believe even in the shadows 
 Yeah, I know You're waiting on me 
 Gonna trust every word You've spoken 
 I will have no other hope and 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me 
 I believe it 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me 
 I know there is joy unspeakable 
 Joy unspeakable is waiting on me 
 Healing hasn't come just yet 
 But I believe that I'm still in Your hands

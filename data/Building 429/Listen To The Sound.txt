Are you in over your head? 
 Are you on water so deep your drowning? 
 Do you think you've been left 
 And there is no on to feel your hurting 
 Well everybody has been there 
 And everybody's felt lost 
 If you're in over your head lift it up, lift it up... oh! 
 Listen to the sound of hope 
 That's rising up over your old horizon 
 Listen to the sound, listen to the sound... 
 And listen to the sound of a new beginning of 
 This is where the old is ending 
 Listen to the sound, listen to the sound... 
 I hear you say your alone 
 I hear you sayin' that you'll never make it 
 I've got to tell you, you're wrong 
 'Cause I have been down this path you're takin' 
 You'll never know what faith is 
 Till you don't understand 
 Sometimes it takes the silence 
 To finally hear his plans... oh! 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
 I once was lost but now I'm found (2x) 
 Listen to the sound of hope 
 That's rising up over your old horizon 
 Listen to the sound, listen to the sound... 
 And listen to the sound of a new beginning of 
 This is where the old is ending 
 Listen to the sound, listen to the sound... oh! 
 His grace is reaching for us 
 His grace is reaching out 
 Listen to the sound, listen to the sound 
 Wherever you are... (2x)

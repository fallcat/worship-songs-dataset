What do you say now when you're starin' in the mirror after you fall down 
 Do you feel small when you're too weak to stand at all 
 You're on your knees now wishin' you could find a way to hide your fear 
 It's hard to see hope when pain is all you know 
 Fearfully and wonderfully made 
 Don't you know that you and I we're not a mistake 
 (Don't you know, don't you know?) 
 Oh, if you could only see His arms are wide open 
 Oh, it's okay to be humbled and broken 
 So let your heart be free cause love has been spoken 
 Don't you know don't you know? Love has been spoken 
 Hold your head high, you and I were born just to shine this light 
 No matter what they say, you are loved and you are safe 
 Fearfully and wonderfully made 
 Don't you know that you and I we're not a mistake 
 (Don't you know, don't you know) 
 Oh, if you could only see His arms are wide open 
 Oh, it's okay to be humbled and broken 
 So let your heart be free cause love has been spoken 
 Don't you know, don't you know? Love has been spoken 
 Grace rushing over you, His word reveals the truth 
 This love in us is meant to share everywhere 
 We're fearfully and wonderfully made 
 Now you and I we're not a mistake 
 Oh, if you could only see His arms are wide open 
 Oh, it's okay to be humbled and broken 
 So let your heart be free cause love has been spoken 
 Don't you know, don't you know? Love has been spoken 
 Love has been spoken

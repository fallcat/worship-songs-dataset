All my life I tried so hard to find me 
 But the more I search, the less it all makes sense 
 I'm finding out that this was not about me 
 You're all that will be standing in the end 
 Take me as I am 
 I've got nothing left to lose 
 I am lifting empty hands 
 'Cause I was made for You 
 Take me as I am 
 I am Yours to use 
 I am lifting empty hands 
 'Cause I was made for You 
 Made for You 
 You, oh God, are the God consuming fire 
 So burn, burn, burn away what isn't true 
 Because I will never live for any other 
 I will keep my heart chasing after You 
 Take me as I am 
 I've got nothing left to lose 
 I am lifting empty hands 
 'Cause I was made for You 
 Take me as I am 
 I am Yours to use 
 I am lifting empty hands 
 'Cause I was made for You 
 Made for You 
 You are God, there is no other 
 I won't bow before another 
 I was made for, I was made for You 
 (x2) 
 Take me as I am 
 I've got nothing left to lose 
 I am lifting empty hands 
 'Cause I was made for You 
 Take me as I am 
 I am Yours to use 
 I am lifting empty hands 
 'Cause I was made for You 
 Made for You 
 You are God, there is no other 
 I won't bow before another 
 I was made for, I was made for You

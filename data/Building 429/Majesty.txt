Lord You are, the light of my heart 
 Grander than the greatest stars 
 You are that I might be alive for thee 
 Lord You came, and breathed anew 
 A gift of life that will not cease 
 I am that You might be glorified 
 And I open my eyes to see 
 I'm asking You Lord reveal to me 
 Your majesty is captivating all of me 
 I stand before the one who makes my heart adore 
 Your majesty beyond what mortal souls could dream 
 We stand amazed breathless as we've come to face 
 Your majesty 
 Lord I come to this place 
 To bring honor to Your name 
 I stand just to sing of Your great fame 
 So I open my heart to You 
 Cause there's nothing else that I can do 
 When Your majesty is captivating all of me 
 I stand before the one who makes my heart adore 
 Your majesty beyond what mortal souls could dream 
 We stand amazed breathless as we've come to face 
 So shine down over your children 
 Reach out and touch us again 
 So shine down over your children 
 Reach out and touch me again 
 I stand before the one who makes my heart adore 
 When Your majesty is captivating all of me 
 I stand before the one who makes my heart adore 
 Your majesty beyond what mortal souls could dream 
 We stand amazed breathless as we've come to face 
 Your majesty 
 Your majesty

The water rages on tonight 
 And the storm is hiding the skyline 
 I try to see the northern shore 
 But the waves are much higher than before 
 From the deep Lord 
 You are beckoning 
 You call out my name 
 Say don't be afraid 'cause I 
 I'm here just believe me 
 So I won't look at the waves 
 I'll look on your face and I 
 I'll walk when I see you 
 Lord give me faith 
 To never look away 
 Staring deep into you eyes 
 I'm standing by your strength 
 But fear and doubt they take my sight 
 And I begin to sink 
 Hear my plea Lord will you 
 Come rescue me 
 It's not that far to where you are 
 With outstretched arms you're calling out my name 
 I'm gonna walk, I'm gonna fall 
 But you'll have my all 
 You've called me by name 
 And I'm not afraid 
 I'm here I believe you 
 I won't look at the waves 
 I'll look on your face and I 
 I'll walk when I see You 
 Lord give me faith to never look away

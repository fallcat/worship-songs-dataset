Somebody's speaking but I can't hear a sound 
 It's spinning all around and this noise is so deafening 
 Opening eyes to find this isn't a dream 
 Everything on TV is real life it's all happening 
 Look in my heart to find the worst that I've seen 
 Still bears resemblance to me though I try 
 It's so hard to breathe when we're swimming in catastrophe 
 It's so hard to see 
 So will You come to me and change my history 
 When You speak my name everything is changing 
 Cause every burden I bring feels like it's missing it's sting 
 When I'm with You it's like a new season of life 
 It's like a new season of life 
 It's like a new season of life 
 Open my soul and then You might see the truth 
 That I'm still too scared to move cause fear is paralyzing me 
 Still all this reaching is stretching my doubts 
 I'm growing closer without my pride 
 And it's so hard to see 
 Will You come to me and change my history 
 When You speak my name everything is changing 
 Cause every burden I bring feels like it's missing it's sting 
 When I'm with You it's like a new season of life 
 It's like a new season of life 
 It's like a new season of life 
 Come to me and change my history 
 Come to me and change my history 
 When You speak my name everything is changing 
 Cause every burden I bring feels like it's missing it's sting 
 When I'm with You it's like a new season of life 
 It's like a new season of life 
 It's like a new season of life

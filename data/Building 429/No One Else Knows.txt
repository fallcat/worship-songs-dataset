My world is closing in 
 On the inside 
 But I'm not showing it 
 When all I am is crying out 
 I hold it in and fake a smile 
 Still I'm broken 
 I'm broken 
 Only one can understand 
 And only one can hold the hand 
 Of the broken 
 Of the broken 
 When no one else knows how I feel 
 Your love for me is proven real 
 When no one else cares where I've been 
 You run to me with outstretched hands 
 And You hold me in your arms 
 Again 
 I need no explanation of why me 
 I just need confirmation 
 Only You could understand the emptiness inside my head 
 I am falling 
 I am falling 
 I'm falling down upon my knees 
 To find the one who gives me peace 
 I am flying 
 Lord I am flying 
 When no one else knows how I feel 
 Your love for me is proven real 
 When no one else cares where I've been 
 You run to me with outstretched hands 
 And You hold me in Your arms 
 Again 
 I have come to you in search of faith 
 'Cause I can't see beyond this place 
 Oh You are God and I am man 
 So I'll leave it in Your hands

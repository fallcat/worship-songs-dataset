If you could run 
 Where would you run to now 
 Where would you hide 
 Now that the truth is out 
 And I know the fear you feel 
 And I know that this is real 
 But please don't run from me 
 Because everyone thinks about it 
 Please don't run from me now, ooh 
 I won't leave you 
 You're never alone 
 Where ever you go 
 Please don't run from me now 
 'Cause I'm not going to let you down 
 This is the hope 
 That you've been longing to know 
 God is alive 
 And He's never left you alone 
 So hold on through the tears 
 And please don't run from me 
 Because everyone thinks about it 
 Please don't run from me now, ooh 
 I won't leave you 
 You're never alone 
 Where ever you go 
 Please don't run from me now 
 Come back come back to life again 
 Where we can be forgiven 
 We're almost home 
 So don't let go 
 This is what we've been waiting for 
 He is the hope that heals the world 
 We're almost home 
 So please 
 Please don't run from me 
 Because everyone thinks about it 
 Please don't run from me now, ooh 
 I won't leave you 
 You're never alone 
 Where ever you go 
 Please don't run from me now 
 Lift up your soul, soul 
 Don't you let go, go 
 Lift up your soul, soul 
 Never let go

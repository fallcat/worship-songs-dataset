I brace my heart for the relapse 
 I'm waiting now for the shame 
 I've been somewhere and I won't go back again 
 I'm holding out for some mercy 
 I'm praying that you'll forgive 
 I've said something and I can't take it back again 
 I'm sorry now, now that it's over 
 You're world crashed down, and I ran for cover 
 I'm sorry now, now that it's over 
 How I wanted to show the way 
 So I pushed you aside I wanted to save the day, but I let you cry 
 How I stood there so silently 
 And let the moments pass by 
 I was too late to save the day 
 I let you die 
 I'm sorry now, now that it's over 
 You're world crashed down, and I ran for cover 
 I'm sorry now, now that it's over 
 We all want to lead but were falling behind 
 Everyone wants to save themselves 
 We all want to lead but were falling behind 
 Everyone wants to save themselves

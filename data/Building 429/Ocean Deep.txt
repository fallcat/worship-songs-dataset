Would You look at me 
 Here in my frailty 
 Yeah, I've been living a lie 
 Believing that I could earn this 
 Would You look at us 
 We say we know Your love 
 And still we think if we fail 
 Somehow You won't be enough 
 But Your mercy is an ocean deep 
 Your grace is washing over me 
 Your love is like a wildfire chasing after me 
 It's more than I deserve 
 Before I've said a word 
 You know all of my fears 
 Every tear I will ever cry 
 And You keep reaching out 
 Far beyond my doubt 
 When I see all that You've done 
 I'm overcome, I am swept away 
 'Cause Your mercy is an ocean deep 
 Your grace is washing over me 
 Your love is like a wildfire chasing after me 
 It's all, it's all that I can do 
 I surrender all I am to You 
 It's all, it's all that I can do 
 'Cause Your mercy is an ocean deep 
 Your grace is washing over me 
 Your love is like a wildfire chasing after me 
 Your mercy is an ocean deep 
 Your grace is washing over me 
 Your love is like a wildfire chasing after me

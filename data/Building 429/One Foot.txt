This is the path less taken 
 This is the life less lived 
 This is where You have placed me 
 And You want all I have to give 
 There were times when I was lonely 
 There were times when I was scared 
 There were moments when I stopped chasing 
 And I was frozen in my fear 
 But I won't be the man 
 Who watched the world passed him by 
 I don't really know where this road is going 
 I don't really know why this door is open 
 Put one foot in front of the other 
 That's how I'm going to discover 
 Who you really are when the world is ending 
 How you raise the dead to new beginnings 
 One foot in front of the other 
 That's how I'm going to discover 
 One foot, one foot at a time 
 One foot, one foot at a time 
 There are those who stood against me 
 They said I'd never measure up 
 All the voices are fading 
 'Cause I care more about Your love 
 But this is not about them 
 It isn't even about me 
 Because my worth is found inside Your eyes 
 So I will rise and sing 
 I won't be the man 
 Who watched the world passed him by 
 I don't really know where this road is going 
 I don't really know why this door is open 
 Put one foot in front of the other 
 That's how I'm going to discover 
 Who you really are when the world is ending 
 How you raise the dead to new beginnings 
 One foot in front of the other 
 That's how I'm going to discover 
 One foot, one foot at a time 
 One foot, one foot at a time 
 Give me open hands 
 And strength to stand 
 Grace to fall 
 'Cause all I want is You in this life 
 Give me open eyes 
 And strength to walk 
 Whether I may rise or fall 
 'Cause all I want is You 
 All I want is You 
 I don't really know where this road is going 
 I don't really know why this door is open 
 Put one foot in front of the other 
 That's how I'm going to discover 
 Who you really are when the world is ending 
 How you raise the dead to new beginnings 
 One foot in front of the other 
 That's how I'm going to discover 
 One foot, one foot at a time 
 One foot, one foot at a time

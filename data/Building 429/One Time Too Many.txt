All the little pieces of time 
 Are adding up to nothing again 
 You'd think I'd finally get this right 
 I think I've fought it one time to many 
 Just one time to many 
 I'm the king of nothing today 
 Looking up to heaven I call your name 
 Come on and change me 
 Cause you know what I need 
 Could you break away the ice frozen around my heart 
 Could you reach through 
 And help me to know you 
 'Cause I'm stranded in this place 
 Falling on my face over and over again 
 I'm holding onto all my mistakes 
 Thinking I'm not worthy of your grace 
 I need to know you love me tonight 
 'Cause I've fallen one time too many 
 Just one time to many 
 I'm the king of nothing today 
 Looking up to heaven I call Your name 
 Am I really worth the price you paid for me 
 I can't believe it? 
 I hear you say 
 That you'll change me 
 Cause yo know what I need 
 And You'll break away the ice frozen around my heart 
 And You'll reach through 
 And help me to know you 
 Cause standing in this place 
 Calling on your name over and over 
 Come on and change me 
 Cause you know what I need 
 Could you break away the ice frozen around my heart 
 Could you reach through 
 And help me to know you 
 'Cause I'm stranded in this place 
 Falling on my face over and over again

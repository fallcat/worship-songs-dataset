I know you're holding tomorrow 
 So I will trust you today 
 You may not keep us from sorrow 
 But I know you will never ever change 
 You've overcome the world 
 To rescue my soul 
 I don't have to worry 
 'Cause whatever comes You're in control 
 Forever I will worship You 
 I'm amazed by the things You've done 
 Well, I am overcome 
 A king so awesome and worthy 
 And though you knew the great cost 
 Your heart was moved with such mercy 
 A God of love you endured the cross 
 You've overcome the world 
 To rescue my soul 
 I don't have to worry 
 'Cause whatever comes You're in control 
 Forever I will worship You 
 I'm amazed by the things You've done 
 Well, I am overcome 
 By your might hands and the power you display 
 Though life gets hard 
 Still in my heart 
 I'll have courage, I'll have faith 
 You've overcome the world 
 To rescue my soul 
 I don't have to worry, no 
 'Cause You're in control 
 Forever I will worship You 
 I'm amazed by the things You have done 
 You've overcome the world 
 You've overcome the world 
 You've overcome the world, Oh

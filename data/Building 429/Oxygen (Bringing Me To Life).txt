Well honestly I'm weaker now 
 Than I've ever been 
 I hate to admit 
 I'm shamefully hesitant 
 In this my bitter my cold 
 I surrender my hope 
 When I gave into the lie again 
 And I believe in the untruth 
 And now I need you 
 Still something says 
 Hold on through the moon light 
 Don't let go, don't let go 
 Something says Hold on through the moon light 
 Don't let go, don't let go 
 And if I could breathe you in 
 I'd be sure to hold my breath 
 'Cause you are like oxygen 
 Bringing me to life 
 So here I stand once again 
 Open me and come on in 
 'Cause you are like oxygen 
 Bringing me to life 
 Its painfully evident that eternity is life 
 And I'm still a child tossed by the waves again 
 So quick to deny 
 Faster to hide 
 Still something says 
 Hold on through the moon light 
 Don't let go, don't let go 
 Something says Hold on through the moon light 
 Don't let go, don't you let go 
 And if I could breathe you in 
 I'd be sure to hold my breath 
 'Cause you are like oxygen 
 Bringing me to life 
 So here I stand once again 
 Open me and come on in 
 'Cause you are like oxygen 
 Bringing me to life 
 You're bringing me to life 
 And if I could breathe you in 
 I'd be sure to hold my breath 
 And like oxygen 
 You're bringing me to life 
 And if I could breathe you in 
 I'd be sure to hold my breath 
 'Cause you are my oxygen 
 Bringing me to life 
 So here I stand once again 
 Open me and come on in 
 'Cause you are my oxygen 
 Bringing me to life 
 You're bringing me to life 
 Come bring me to life 
 Bring me to life 
 Bring me to life

Imagine loneliness 
 Banished by communion 
 Imagine brokenness 
 Sheltered under grace 
 And disillusioned children 
 Finding their reunion 
 With the author and 
 Perfector of their faith. 
 God come down, 
 Hear the sound 
 Jesus, we cry to You 
 Only by the Power of Your Name, Lord 
 Will I live, will I live 
 Calling all you people to proclaim 
 Adonai, Adonai 
 Oh Holy Father 
 You have brought salvation 
 Beauty for ashes 
 Hope for all our shame 
 And liberation rings 
 Over every nation 
 Love has been redeemed 
 By the power of Your Name 
 God come down, 
 Hear the sound 
 Jesus, we're cryin' out to You 
 Only by the Power of Your Name 
 Will I live, will I live 
 Calling all you people to proclaim 
 Adonai, Adonai 
 Only by the Power of Your Name 
 Only by the Power of Your Name 
 Will I live, will I live 
 (Only by the Power of Your Name) 
 (Will I live, will I live) 
 The heavens and the earth 
 Will pass away 
 But only love 
 Yes, Your love 
 Only love will remain 
 Only by the Power of Your Name 
 By Your Name

We are the promise 
 We are the dream 
 We are the raindrop that precedes a hurricane 
 We are the proclamation, the possibility 
 We are the river when you only see a stream 
 Singing hey now it's time to go. 
 Get your hands in the air and the feet off the floor. 
 Hey now it's time to go, get your hands in the air. 
 I'm calling everybody around the world tonight 
 Welcome to the party it's a revolution 
 And I'm calling everybody we've just begun tonight 
 You are the future you're a revolution 
 Calling all the hopeless ones, 
 For the lost who've come undone 
 Wherever you've been 
 Lets start it again 
 I'm calling everybody, I'm calling everybody 
 You've been made new yea you are the revolution. 
 We are expectation, the opportunity 
 We are the beauty when you only see the pain 
 We are optimism, we stand and we believe 
 That we are redemption in the middle of the shame 
 Singing hey now it's time to go 
 Get your hands in the air and the feet off the floor 
 Hey now it's time to go, get your hands in the air 
 I'm calling everybody around the world tonight 
 Welcome to the party it's a revolution 
 And I'm calling everybody we've just begun tonight 
 You are the future you're a revolution 
 Calling all the hopeless ones, 
 For the lost who've come undone 
 Wherever you've been 
 Lets start it again 
 And I'm calling everybody, I'm calling everybody 
 You've been made new, yea you are the revolution 
 Calling all the broken ones wherever you may be 
 It's time to rise up to your new identity 
 No longer can we stand idly by and just watch the war 
 When we're the one's who have the hope 
 This world is searching for. 
 We are not weak 
 We've been made strong 
 If you believe 
 Then sing along 
 Hey now it's time to go. 
 Get your hands in the air and the feet off the floor. 
 Hey now it's time to go, get your hands in the air 
 I'm calling everybody around the world tonight 
 Welcome to the party it's a revolution 
 And I'm calling everybody we've just begun tonight 
 You are the future you're a revolution 
 Calling all the hopeless ones, 
 For the lost who've come undone 
 Wherever you've been 
 Lets start it again 
 I'm calling everybody, I'm calling everybody 
 You've been made new yea you are the revolution

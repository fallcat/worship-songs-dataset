I've seen it and felt it 
 Hopelessness with no lifeline 
 The wicked are feeding on 
 Innocence and our decline 
 You and I we are the same 
 Torn apart by different things 
 All our faith is barely alive 
 But we're going to make it through the night 
 I want you to know 
 When the world is on your back 
 And you think that you will never last 
 When you're lonely and you are confused 
 I'll be right beside you 
 When the walls are closing in 
 And you think you'd rather sink than swim 
 When you think there's nothing left for you to lose 
 I'll be right beside you 
 I'll be with you 
 We are precious 
 More than priceless is our worth 
 Loved by the Father 
 Heaven's children here on earth 
 You and I we are the same 
 Lifted up above the pain 
 By He's wounds we have been healed 
 And in our love He is revealed 
 I want you to know (I need you to know) 
 When the world is on your back 
 And you think that you will never last 
 When you're lonely and you are confused 
 I'll be right beside you 
 When the walls are closing in 
 And you think you'd rather sink than swim 
 When there's nothing left for you to lose 
 I'll be right beside you 
 Hold on, don't you let go of me 
 I'll be here through it all 
 Hold on, when you're ready to fall 
 I will carry you 
 I will never leave you 
 I will lift you if you fall 
 When the world is on your back 
 And you think that you will never last 
 When you're lonely and you are confused 
 I'll be right beside you 
 When the walls are closing in 
 And you think you'd rather sink than swim 
 When there's nothing left for you to lose 
 I'll be right beside you 
 I'll be with you 
 I'll be right beside you

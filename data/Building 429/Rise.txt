What's a boy supposed to see 
 When he's staring in the mirror at age 13 
 Where's the man that he wants to be 
 He must be hiding behind the lies that he's too weak 
 I was there when they pushed you down 
 Wiped the blood from your knees when you got up off the ground 
 No one ever knew you the way I did 
 They never saw the man you'd be 
 When they laughed at the awkward kid 
 No one else believed that you could fly 
 They couldn't see the man you'd be 
 But it's wonderful to watch you rise 
 What could make a child a man (help him understand) 
 When he's looking at the scars that mar his gentle hands 
 Where's the mercy that he needs 
 It must be hiding behind the pain that they can't speak 
 (It must be hiding behind the cut that makes them bleed) 
 I was there when they pushed you down 
 Wiped the blood from your knees when you got up off the ground 
 I was there when they crowned you king 
 Wiped the blood from your feet when you hung from the tree 
 No one ever knew you the way I did 
 They never saw you in the child 
 As they laughed at his awkwardness 
 No one else believed that you could fly 
 They couldn't see the man you'd be 
 But it's wonderful to watch you rise

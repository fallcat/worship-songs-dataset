Just a boy with something in his heart 
 Says life doesn't add up 
 The dreams inside 
 Are telling him, seek and you will find 
 He caught a ride and left this town 
 He never came back around 
 Lord I miss him now but, 
 He had to reach, to make sense of his world 
 We are all searching for a Savior 
 'Cause no one else will do 
 When the sky is calling you 
 We are all searching for a Savior 
 'Cause no one else will do 
 When the sky is calling you 
 Another town a half world away 
 There's a child who just can't stay 
 Oh something else 
 Is calling her, to another place 
 She believes that nothing they could say 
 Would ever take away the pain 
 Of living life 
 Without knowing love, or amazing grace 
 Something's missing from us all 
 We are all searching for a Savior 
 'Cause no one else will do 
 When the sky is calling you 
 We are all searching for a Savior 
 'Cause no one else will do 
 When the sky is calling you

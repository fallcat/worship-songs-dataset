I want a faith that's so alive 
 It can be seen 
 I want a hope I cannot hide 
 Even when I'm weak 
 I want a love that speaks the truth 
 Of what I believe 
 I want you, you're all I need 
 Set a fire in me 
 Bring me to my knees 
 Like a rushing wind 
 Consume this heart again 
 Set a fire 
 Turn this spark inside of me 
 To a holy flame 
 Burns away all my fear 
 And fills me with strength 
 Come and bring this heart to life 
 'Cause I'm not ashamed 
 I want you, you're all I need 
 Yeah, I want you, Jesus 
 You're all I need! 
 Set a fire in me 
 Bring me to my knees 
 Like a rushing wind 
 Consume this heart again 
 Set a fire 
 Set a fire! 
 Oh, let your love be a wave of mercy 
 Come in me, open up my eyes 
 Oh, fill my heart with a passion burning 
 Come in me, open up my eyes!

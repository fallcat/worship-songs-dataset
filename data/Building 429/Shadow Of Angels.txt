Sunrise on Sunset Beach 
 Finds me right where I watched it set 
 I spent the night inside myself 
 But I haven't found me yet 
 But I'm not running from you anymore 
 I'm not running from you anymore, no not anymore 
 'Cause I believe that when I call for you 
 You hear the plea for my rescue 
 And You lift me up above the world I know 
 And I know that when I speak Your name 
 You hear my voice and send your saints 
 To cover me in the shadow of angels 
 I got caught in the memories 
 'Cause they never fail to prove 
 I'm insecure and incomplete 
 It's a stinging point of truth 
 So I will never find the best of me 
 Until I find myself in You, I'll find myself in You

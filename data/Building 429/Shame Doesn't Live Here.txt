I had a million scars buried in regret 
 Hidden in the dark, I was filled with emptiness 
 That's where You found me 
 God, Your love moved in and made my heart Your home 
 Every broken piece, it belongs to You alone 
 Oh, this is Your house 
 Oh-oh-oh, God, this is Your house 
 Shame doesn't live here anymore 
 It doesn't live here anymore 
 Oh, Jesus, You paid it all 
 And now Your grace is mine forevermore 
 I lift my hands 'cause I am Yours 
 Hallelujah, shame doesn't live here anymore 
 All that was before mercy has erased 
 Everything is new, overwhelmed by Your embrace 
 I am forgiven 
 Oh-oh-oh, I stand forgiven 
 Shame doesn't live here anymore 
 It doesn't live here anymore 
 Oh, Jesus, You paid it all 
 And now Your grace is mine forevermore 
 I lift my hands 'cause I am Yours 
 Hallelujah, shame doesn't live here anymore 
 All because of Your love, all because of Your love 
 I know I am free, I know I am free 
 All because of the cross, all because of the cross 
 I know I am free, I know I am free 
 I know! 
 Hey, shame doesn't live here anymore 
 It doesn't live here anymore 
 Oh, Jesus, You paid it all 
 And now Your grace is mine forevermore 
 I lift my hands 'cause I am Yours 
 Hallelujah, shame doesn't live here anymore! 
 Doesn't live here anymore, no-o 
 Shame doesn't live here anymore!

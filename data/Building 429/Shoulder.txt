Everybody needs a friend now and then 
 To come and pick their heart up again 
 When everything gets shattered 
 Everybody needs someone to understand 
 Someone just to come and hold their hand 
 To be there through disaster 
 And I'm going to be there for you 
 So when you're crying 
 I want to be the shoulder you lean on 
 And when you're lonely 
 I'm never gonna leave you so just hold on 
 And when you're crying 
 I want to be the shoulder you lean on 
 You say you don't need anyone 
 But I know when you come undone 
 That you might change your story 
 I don't know if you're listening 
 But when you feel like giving in 
 I'm going to hold you in these arms 
 'Cause all I am is a word away 
 So when you're crying 
 I want to be the shoulder you lean on 
 When you're lonely 
 I'm never gonna leave you so just hold on 
 When you're crying 
 I want to be the shoulder you lean on 
 Oh yes I do 
 And if you're on top of the world 
 And you fall down 
 You're shaking inside 
 And you can't find your ground 
 When you lose yourself, God will find you 
 Hey, you need to know that, the door is open 
 When your broken 
 Come on step on through 
 Step on through 
 Oh, when you're crying 
 I want to be the shoulder you lean on 
 When you're lonely 
 I'm never gonna leave you so just hang on 
 When you're crying 
 I want to be the shoulder you lean on 
 Oh, yes I do 
 So just hold on

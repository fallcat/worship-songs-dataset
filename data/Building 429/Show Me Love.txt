Love is patient love is kind 
 You love me and You don't mind 
 That I'm not so perfect 
 You know I'm undefined 
 My actions fail to show 
 But in spite of me you seem to know 
 That I only want to love you 
 I don't mean to be so cold 
 My words have cut You to the bone 
 But my heart still longs for you alone 
 Show me love, show me life, give me time 
 Because I want to shine in spite of who I am 
 Show me love, give me time 
 Because I want to shine in spite of who I am 
 I know by you I am justified 
 But still I can't find the line 
 Where my works will match my faith 
 And I'll lay myself aside 
 My actions fail to show 
 But in spite of me you seem to know 
 That I only want to love you 
 I can't make it on my own 
 When my mind denies the love I know 
 My life sends nails through your bones 
 Show me love, show me life, give me time 
 Because I want to shine in spite of who I am 
 Show me love, give me time 
 Because I want to shine in spite of who I am 
 I can't define Your love but I need it I need it yeah 
 I can't give enough of me but You want it so I'll give it 
 I don't deserve Your love but I have it, I have it now 
 Show me love, show me life, give me time 
 Because I want to shine in spite of who I am 
 Show me love, give me time 
 Because I want to shine 
 Show me love, show me life, give me time 
 Because I want to shine 
 Show me love, show me life, wait, give me time 
 Because I want to shine in spite of who I am

In the middle of the night 
 When I finally close my eyes 
 With the memory of the day 
 Running circles in my mind 
 The voice that calms the seas 
 Is whispering to me 
 Putting all my fears to rest 
 Yeah You put them all to rest 
 Then I realize that You're always by my side 
 When I stand, when I fall, when the lights go off 
 You You're singing over me 
 You're singing over me tonight 
 With every star that's in this midnight sky 
 You, You're singing over me 
 You're singing over me tonight 
 And my heart is overcome with Your song 
 With Your song 
 From the depths of my soul 
 You are calling me 
 To the evidence of You 
 In all Your Glory 
 From the iris of an eye 
 To the mountains majesty 
 Putting all my doubts to rest 
 Yeah then I realize that you are always by my side 
 In my worst and best, in this beating chest, 
 When I'm living dying always finding 
 You You're singing over me 
 You're singing over me tonight 
 With every star that's in this midnight sky 
 You, You're singing over me 
 You're singing over me tonight 
 And my heart is overcome with Your song 
 With Your song 
 I'm singing along 
 Yeah, I can hear it 
 And I'm singing along

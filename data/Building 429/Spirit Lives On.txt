Oh I watched it all fall down 
 I saw your face in the crowd 
 I saw the tears flowing from your eyes 
 I saw the fire in the sky 
 And we had no reason why 
 I asked will we ever be the same 
 You said to me 
 The spirit lives on, 
 Long after life, long after death 
 Has crumbled to the ground 
 The spirit lives on, 
 Long after life, long after death 
 They will always be around 
 Because the spirit lives on 
 I heard about the cross 
 How they thought all was lost 
 And how your friends trembled in their fear 
 And I heard about the nails 
 And the crown upon your head 
 And I know they thought you'd never rise again 
 But I can hear you say 
 I will live on 
 Long after life, long after death 
 Has crumbled to the ground 
 I will live on 
 Long after life, long after death 
 I will always be around 
 Oh I will live on

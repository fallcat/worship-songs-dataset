It's a simple place where two roads meet 
 Four ways to go but only one for me 
 Takes a lot of faith 
 And a lot of love 
 Knowing there are three worlds that I'll never see but I still believe 
 You have what's best for me 
 A hundred miles here and a thousand there 
 "Choose your life" says the sign as I stare at the horizon 
 What is meant for me? 
 What is it that you want me to see? 
 I feel so alone. 
 Can you hear me breathe? 
 Without you I'm stranded 
 I'm lost and all alone as I cry out 
 Without you I'm stranded 
 And I'm lost and all alone as I cry out 
 "Can you take me back?" 
 I know I've made mistakes in the past 
 I know I haven't always lived like you asked 
 But I know in my heart I only have to trust in you 
 'Cause my past can't change your truth 
 It's been a long road here and there's a long road ahead 
 It's a simple place where I'm come to rest 
 Only wish I knew if I had made a wrong turn 
 I wish I had a heart to yearn for more of you 
 But can you see me stranded? 
 Without you I'm stranded 
 I'm lost and all alone as I cry out 
 And without you I'm stranded 
 And I'm lost and all alone as I cry out 
 "Will you take me back?" 
 It's only a, b, c or d. 
 Father where do you want me? 
 Father you know that I will follow you 
 Wherever you may lead 
 Without you I'm stranded 
 I'm lost and all alone as I cry out 
 And without you I'm stranded 
 And I'm lost and all alone as I cry out 
 I'm feelin' so lost, and so alone 
 And without you I'm stranded 
 I'm lost and all alone as I cry out 
 "Can you take me back, again? 
 Take me back, take me back again 
 Can you take me home, again?"

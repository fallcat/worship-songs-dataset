I want you to know 
 That I'm getting stronger 
 With every punch you throw 
 I'm not staying down 
 Staying down 
 Oh no 
 I'm getting stronger 
 With every word you say 
 I'm not staying down 
 I'm getting stronger 
 I look into your eyes 
 And I see pain 
 I can see the fear 
 But you hide it away 
 When you push me 
 When you push me 
 I'm looking at your hands 
 And I see scars 
 Looking at the remains of 
 Your broken heart 
 When you push me 
 Yeah you push me 
 You got less than you deserved 
 So you need someone to hurt 
 I want you to know 
 That I'm getting stronger 
 With every punch you throw 
 I'm not staying down 
 Staying down 
 Oh no 
 I'm getting stronger 
 With every word you say 
 I'm not staying down 
 I'm getting stronger 
 You know how it feels to fall apart 
 You got it all 
 But it's a house of cards 
 When you push me 
 When you push me 
 Masquerading like a king on a hill 
 If they knew you 
 Would they love you still 
 When you push me 
 Yea you push me 
 And every day you just get worse 
 So you need to share the hurt 
 I want you to know 
 That I'm getting stronger 
 With every punch you throw 
 I'm not staying down 
 Staying down 
 Oh no 
 I'm getting stronger 
 With every word you say 
 I'm not staying down 
 I'm getting stronger 
 Someday 
 Someday 
 Oh 
 Maybe some day 
 We'll find a way 
 To stand together 
 And maybe you'll see 
 That you're just like me 
 We're stand together 
 And maybe some day 
 We'll find a way 
 To stand together 
 Maybe you'll see 
 You're just like me 
 We're stand together 
 I want you to know 
 That I'm getting stronger 
 With every punch you throw 
 I'm not staying down 
 Staying down 
 Oh no 
 I'm getting stronger 
 With every word you say 
 I'm not staying down 
 I'm getting stronger 
 Maybe some day 
 We'll find a way 
 To help each other 
 Maybe you'll see 
 That you're just like me 
 And we're stand together 
 Maybe some day 
 We'll find a way 
 To help each other 
 Maybe you'll see 
 That you're just like me 
 And we're stand together 
 Maybe some day 
 We'll find a way

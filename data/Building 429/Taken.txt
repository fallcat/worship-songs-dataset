Little did we know just how far we'd fall 
 Far enough to dim the light of the sun 
 We're clouded and alone, we're broken and abused 
 It took us where You said it would 
 But I just want to see You now 
 Oh You know that I just need to see You now 
 You are so beautiful 
 You are so beautiful tonight 
 Perfect and unchanging 
 Your love has spoken over me 
 I'm taken by what I see tonight 
 Yeah tonight 
 Completely misread and completely unconfessed 
 All the unrequited love that I've seen 
 How perfectly does that flame still burn 
 Even through the highest tides 
 And I see clearly what I missed 
 Oh You know that I see all I want is this 
 You are so beautiful 
 You are so beautiful 
 You are so beautiful tonight 
 Perfect and unchanging 
 Your love has spoken over me 
 I'm taken by what I see 
 Tonight the sky is mine to see 
 Tonight the ties are broken 
 Tonight I will fall on you 
 Tonight this life is reckoning 
 Tonight you're words were spoken 
 Tonight I will fall on You 
 You are so beautiful 
 You are so beautiful 
 You are so beautiful tonight 
 Perfect and unchanging 
 Your love has spoken over me 
 I'm taken by what I see tonight

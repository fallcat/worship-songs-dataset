Wish I could talk to the younger me 
 Caught up in all his insecurities 
 Afraid to walk on the raging seas 
 Step on out, step on in 
 Say the words that I never heard 
 That could a steady a heart that hurts 
 Young men worry things will never turn 
 Wish I could say to the younger me 
 It's okay not to be okay 
 We all long for an easier way 
 Beauty grows in the strangest places 
 Don't be afraid to stand and face it 
 It's not when we get where we're going that counts 
 It's how we live the journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 Maybe you know how it feels to be 
 Caught in a story that you want to leave 
 Wondering when the struggle ends 
 My Father finishes what He begins 
 It's okay not to be okay 
 We all long for an easier way 
 Beauty grows in the strangest places 
 Don't be afraid to stand and face it 
 It's not what we did, it's where we're going that counts 
 It's how we live the journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 Go out and live the journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 Go on and sail 'cross the widest of oceans 
 And find there is hope when the strong winds are blowing 
 'Cause you'll never be alone 
 He'll be with you all along 
 He wants you to live with a heart that's wide open 
 So you can dance like there's nobody watching 
 'Cause you'll never live it all 
 If you never risk the fall 
 It's okay, if you're not okay 
 'Cause beauty grows when you stand and face it 
 So don't be afraid 
 It's okay not to be okay 
 We all long for an easier way 
 Beauty grows in the strangest places 
 Don't be afraid to stand and face it 
 It's not when we get where we're where going that counts 
 It's how... it's how we live the journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 It's how we live the journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 Go out and live the journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 Go out and live, go out and live 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 The journey 
 Journey, journey, journey 
 We live the journey 
 Journey, journey, journey

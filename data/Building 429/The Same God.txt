When I was five I walked the aisle singing, just as I am 
 While my granddaddy held my hand 
 He said you were a big God, so I 
 So I laid my life down 
 I grew up in that old church listening to the sound 
 Voices of worship ringing out 
 They said You were a big God but I 
 I wondered how You fit in that small town 
 I was seventeen, I just had to leave 
 To find out who You are to me 
 I needed to 
 Climb a mountain and find You there 
 Hear Your voice in the ocean air 
 And sing hallelujah in a language I've never known 
 Find Your hand on the raging sea 
 Face the storm and know Your peace 
 Sing hallelujah over the years I have grown 
 And after all that I have seen 
 You're still the same God to me 
 At the age of twenty-two I walked the aisle again 
 There I took her in my hand 
 We said You were a big God and 
 So our little family began 
 I couldn't ask for more, than what You gave me, Lord 
 What was I still searching for? 
 I needed to 
 Climb a mountain and find You there 
 Hear Your voice in the ocean air 
 And sing hallelujah in a language I've never known 
 Find Your hand on the raging sea 
 Face the storm and know Your peace 
 Sing hallelujah over the years I have grown 
 And after all that I have seen 
 You're still the same God to me 
 You're still the same God 
 Healer, provider, my hope in the fire 
 You're still the same God 
 You never change 
 I needed to 
 Climb a mountain and find You there 
 Hear Your voice in the ocean air 
 And sing hallelujah in a language I've never known 
 Find Your hand on the raging sea 
 Face the storm and know Your peace 
 Sing hallelujah over the years I have grown 
 And after all that I have seen 
 And after all that I have seen 
 You're still the same God to me 
 You're still the same God 
 You're still the same God to me

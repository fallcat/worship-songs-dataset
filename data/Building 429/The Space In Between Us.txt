Look at my heart again 
 Look at the mess I've got it in 
 I'm learning to trust in You 
 To know that you'll see me 
 Through my pride 
 Through my shame 
 Into Your love 
 Into Your grace 
 I'm not looking back 
 Till I see Your face 
 I'm running straight to You 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 To break this division 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 Erase it and bring us together again 
 My life's an open book 
 Nothing is hidden when You look 
 You break through my boundaries 
 Revealing my insecurities 
 But through my pride 
 And through my shame 
 You show me love 
 You show me grace 
 I'm not looking back 
 Till I see your face 
 I'm running straight to you 
 Because 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 To break this division 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 Erase it and bring us together again 
 Together again 
 Here I am saying I need you 
 I know I need you 
 Here I am, I'm coming to meet you 
 'Cause I want to see you 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 Erase it and bring us together 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 To break this division 
 All I really want to do is to fall into 
 The emptiness that is 
 The space in-between us 
 Erase it and bring us together again 
 Bring us back together again 
 Bring us back together again

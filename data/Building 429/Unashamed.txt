I am unashamed 
 I am unashamed 
 I've been down and broken 
 But I believe what you've spoken 
 You make all things new 
 I've witnessed your mercy 
 Stirred up all of your glory 
 And none compared to you 
 I can't help but speak of the things you've done 
 So let my life proclaim 
 I am unashamed 
 I won't hide your name 
 So all the world will know 
 That you 
 You are all that I live for 
 Jesus 
 I am unashamed 
 Where your hands are reaching 
 Is where you'll always find me 
 'Cause your love makes me move 
 To speak the words you're speaking 
 To be the hope the wold has needed 
 In everything I do 
 Here in the light of what you've done 
 Let my life proclaim 
 I am unashamed 
 I won't hide your name 
 So that all the world will know 
 You're all that I live for 
 Jesus 
 I am unashamed 
 So let the waters rise 
 Let the mountains shake 
 We lift our anthem high 
 So let the waters rise 
 Let the mountains shake 
 We lift our anthem high 
 Unashamed 
 So let the waters rise 
 Let the mountains shake 
 We lift our anthem high 
 Unashamed 
 So let the waters rise 
 Let the mountains shake 
 We lift our anthem high 
 Unashamed 
 I am unashamed 
 I won't hide your name 
 So that all the world will know 
 That you 
 You are all that I live for 
 Jesus 
 I am unashamed 
 I will shout your name 
 So all the world will know 
 That you 
 You're all that I live for 
 Jesus 
 I am unashamed

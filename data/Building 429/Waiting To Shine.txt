God I've always wondered what You look like 
 Lord I've always waited staring at the sky 
 But the heavens remained quiet 
 As they drift along in peace 
 Sometimes they've turned to thunder 
 Still the echoes always cease 
 How I long to get home 
 Lord I hope it won't be long 
 Till You 
 Let the skies open wide 
 Let Your child see Your eyes 
 Iris to iris 
 I will be waiting 
 Let the skies open wide 
 Let Your children be like 
 Diamonds reflecting 
 We will be waiting to shine 
 Waiting to shine 
 Chasing after vapors left me cold 
 Cause obscurity befalls me like a diamond cased in coal 
 But Your hand has been upon me and Your workmanship is true 
 And years I've spent in darkness made me long to shine for You 
 All I want is to see Your face 
 All I'm praying for today 
 Is that You'd 
 Let the skies open wide 
 Let Your child see Your eyes 
 Iris to iris 
 I will be waiting 
 Let the skies open wide 
 Let Your children be like 
 Diamonds reflecting 
 We will be waiting to shine 
 Waiting to shine 
 Sing Halleluiah to our God 
 Sing Halleluiah we are found 
 Sing halleluiah for the Savior has come down 
 Let the skies open wide 
 Let Your child see Your eyes 
 Iris to iris 
 I will be waiting 
 Let the skies open wide 
 Let Your children be like 
 Diamonds reflecting 
 We will be waiting 
 Sunset to sunset we will be waiting 
 Sunset to sunset we will be waiting 
 Waiting to shine 
 Still waiting to shine

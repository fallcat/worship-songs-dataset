I'm where I don't wanna stay 
 Close enough but far away 
 There is just too much at stake 
 I don't want to miss the moment of embrace, yeah, 
 I don't wanna stand at an arm's length 
 From the hands that are reaching to save me 
 Right here right now His hands are reaching out 
 I don't wanna stand at an arm's length 
 From the hands that are reaching to hold me 
 Right here right now my walls are coming down 
 I keep waiting for the sign 
 But maybe I'm the one that's blind 
 Let my fear and faith collide 
 'Cause I don't want to miss the reason I'm alive, yeah 
 I don't wanna stand at an arm's length 
 From the hands that are reaching to save me 
 Right here right now His hands are reaching out 
 I don't wanna stand at an arm's length 
 From the hands that are reaching to hold me 
 Right here right now my walls are coming down 
 And I spend all my life holding back, holding back 
 And now I wonder, what for? I won't hold back any more 
 I don't wanna stand at an arm's length 
 From the hands that are reaching to save me 
 Right here right now His hands are reaching out 
 I don't wanna stand at an arm's length 
 From the hands that are reaching to hold me 
 Right here right now my walls are coming down

We are in combat for our lives 
 We fight and we fear that we won't survive 
 And our only hope now is laying our weapons down 
 And falling into Your arms 
 My faith is worn and my hands are tired 
 My heart is torn between the truth and the lyin' 
 So I run 'cause I'm done and I need You 
 You're the one that will come to my rescue 
 My flesh and bones are caught in a war zone 
 And this is the struggle this is the curse 
 We're caught in the middle of heaven and earth 
 And our only hope now is laying our pride down 
 And falling into Your arms 
 My faith is worn and my hands are tired 
 My heart is torn between the truth and the lyin' 
 So I run 'cause I'm done and I need You 
 You're the one that will come to my rescue 
 My flesh and bones are caught in a war zone 
 Oh oh ooh, caught in a war zone 
 My faith is worn and my hands are tired 
 My heart is torn between the truth and the lyin' 
 So I run 'cause I'm done and I need You 
 You're the one that will come to my rescue 
 My flesh and bones... 
 My faith is worn and my hands are tired 
 My heart is torn between the truth and the lyin' 
 So I run 'cause I'm done and I need You 
 You're the one that will come to my rescue 
 My flesh and bones are caught in a war zone 
 Oh oh ooh, are caught in a war zone 
 Oh oh ooh, are caught in a war zone

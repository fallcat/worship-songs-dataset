This world has nothing for me 
 This life is not my own 
 I know you go before me 
 And I am not alone 
 This mountain rises higher 
 The way seem so unclear 
 But I know that you'll go with me 
 So I will never fear 
 I will trust in you 
 Whatever will come my way 
 Through fire or pouring rain 
 No we won't be shaken 
 No we won't be shaken 
 Whatever tomorrow brings 
 Together well rise and sing 
 That we won't be shaken 
 No we won't be shaken 
 Oho, oho, oh, oho, oho, oh 
 Oho, oho, oh, 
 No we won't be shaken 
 You know my every longing 
 You heard my every prayer 
 You've held in my weakness 
 Cause you were always there 
 So Ill stay in full surrender 
 As you're weighting on my own 
 My mind is set on nothing else 
 You and you alone 
 I will not be moved, oh 
 Whatever will come my way 
 Through fire or pouring rain 
 No we won't be shaken 
 No we won't be shaken 
 Whatever tomorrow brings 
 Together well rise and sing 
 That we won't be shaken 
 We will trust in you 
 We will not be moved 
 We will trust in you 
 And we won't be shaken 
 We will trust in you 
 We will not be moved 
 We will trust in you 
 Yeah, we won't be shaken 
 We will trust in you 
 We will not be moved 
 We will trust in you 
 And we won't be shaken 
 No we won't be shaken 
 Whatever will come my way 
 Through fire or pouring rain 
 No we won't be shaken 
 No we won't be shaken 
 Whatever tomorrow brings 
 Together well rise and sing 
 That we won't be shaken

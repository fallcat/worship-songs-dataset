Sometimes it feels like I'm watching from the outside 
 Sometimes it feels like I'm breathing but am I alive 
 I will keep searching for answers that aren't here to find 
 All I know is I'm not home yet 
 This is not where I belong 
 Take this world and give me Jesus 
 This is not where I belong 
 So when the walls come falling down on me 
 And when I'm lost in the current of a raging sea 
 I have this blessed assurance holding me. 
 All I know is I'm not home yet 
 This is not where I belong 
 Take this world and give me Jesus 
 This is not where I belong 
 When the earth shakes I wanna be found in You 
 When the lights fade I wanna be found in You 
 All I know is I'm not home yet 
 This is not where I belong 
 Take this world and give me Jesus 
 This is not where I belong 
 (x2) 
 Where I belong, where I belong 
 Where I belong, where I belong

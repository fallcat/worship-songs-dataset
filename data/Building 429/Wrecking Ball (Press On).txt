Sometimes this world starts breaking me down 
 I get so lost I think I'll never be found 
 And there are moments of fear and doubt 
 Even the best fall to the ground 
 I am a mess, I am a wrecking ball 
 I must confess that I still don't get it all 
 Lord I believe that all your words are true 
 Doesn't matter where I'm going if I'm going with you 
 I press on, I press on, I press on 
 When I still don't get it 
 I see the world through my jaded eyes 
 I get frustrated when there is no why 
 I put my focus on worthless things 
 Even the strong fall to their knees 
 God only knows what we all need 
 I am a mess, I am a wrecking ball 
 I must confess that I still don't get it all 
 Lord I believe that all your words are true 
 Doesn't matter where I'm going if I'm going with you 
 I press on, I press on, I press on 
 When I still don't get it 
 Life goes on, life goes on 
 But your love will prove 
 All I need, all I need 
 I will find in you 
 Life goes on, life goes on 
 But your love will prove 
 All I need, all I need 
 I will find in you 
 I press on 
 I am a mess, I am a wrecking ball 
 I must confess that I still don't get it all 
 Lord I believe that all your words are true 
 Doesn't matter where I'm going if I'm going with you 
 I press on, I press on 
 I press on, I press on 
 When I still don't get it 
 Life goes on, life goes on 
 But your love will prove 
 All I need, all I need 
 I will find in you 
 Life goes on, life goes on 
 But your love will prove 
 All I need, all I need 
 I press on

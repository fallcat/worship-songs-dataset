I still remember three feet tall 
 Standing next to you I felt so small 
 I would've walked a million miles 
 Just to see you look at me and smile 
 Would it have been so hard 
 To give me just a little space 
 Inside your heart 
 Cause all I ever wanted 
 And all I ever needed 
 Was 
 Just to hear you say 
 You are loved my son 
 To hear you speak my name 
 And say well done 
 Well done 
 Staring at the sky I feel so small 
 Still you see me underneath it all 
 You tell me I have never been alone 
 And that you even named me as your own 
 You still wear the scars 
 From when you laid down everything 
 For my heart 
 And all that you are giving 
 Is all that I am needing 
 Just to hear you say 
 You are loved my son 
 To hear you speak my name 
 And say well done 
 Well done 
 You're a father to the fatherless 
 A hero to the heroless 
 A savior for anyone who's wanting 
 Who's needing... 
 You're a father to the fatherless 
 A hero to the heroless 
 A savior for anyone who's wanting 
 Who's needing... 
 Just to hear you say 
 You are loved my son 
 To hear you speak my name 
 And say well done 
 Well done

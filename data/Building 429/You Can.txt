I'm not a saint, I have no doubt 
 Here in my weakness, working it out 
 I am no hero at all 
 Were You looking for someone else 
 Who could be as strong as nails? 
 I don't understand why You would call me 
 I'll never make it myself 
 'Cause I need Your help 
 I can't walk on the water 
 I can't stand in the fire 
 Unless I look into Your eyes 
 Unless I have You by my side 
 I can't conquer a giant 
 Or shut the mouth of a lion 
 I know that I am just a man 
 But I am in Your hands 
 And You can 
 Don't wanna turn and run away 
 From what You called me to embrace 
 Give me courage, give me faith 
 I wanna see the mountains move 
 I wanna walk the path You choose 
 Wherever You lead, I'll follow You 
 I can't walk on the water 
 I can't stand in the fire 
 Unless I look into Your eyes 
 Unless I have You by my side 
 I can't conquer a giant 
 Or shut the mouth of a lion 
 I know that I am just a man 
 But when I'm in Your hands 
 You can 
 Keep loving, I keep fighting, keep open 
 Even in the midst of the silence 
 Keep trusting, keep climbing, keep running 
 Even when I feel like I can't 
 I can walk on the water 
 I can stand in the fire 
 When I look into Your eyes 
 When I have You by my side 
 I can conquer a giant 
 And shut the mouth of a lion 
 I know that I am just a man 
 But I am in Your hands 
 And You can 
 Keep loving, I keep fighting 
 And You can 
 Keep trusting, keep climbing 
 I know that I am just a man 
 But I am in Your hands 
 And You can

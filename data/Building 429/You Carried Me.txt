I've been so busy, I missed the reasons 
 I missed Your love, and I nearly missed it all 
 Still You've loved me, and You've healed me 
 You've given all and it brought me to Your cross 
 And I stand only because You've given me grace to walk 
 Only because 
 You carried me 
 You carried me 
 You carried me through it all 
 And I believe 
 Yes I believe 
 You'll carry me all the way home 
 Cause mercy covers all 
 I know the scripture, I've known the songs 
 I sang the words from my hollowed heart 
 But You've spoken softly through the storm 
 I've heard Your voice and I've felt the calm 
 I stand only because You've given me faith to walk 
 Only because 
 You carried me 
 You carried me 
 You carried me through it all 
 And I believe 
 Yes I believe 
 You'll carry me all the way home 
 I know that you love me 
 I'll never doubt it, I can't live without it 
 Your mercy has found me 
 I am astounded, I can't live without it ooh 
 You carried me, You carried me 
 Through it all... 
 You carried me 
 You carried me 
 And I believe 
 Yeah I believe 
 You'll carry me all the way home 
 Cause mercy covers all 
 Mercy covers all 
 Yeah, yeah 
 And I believe 
 And I believe 
 I believe

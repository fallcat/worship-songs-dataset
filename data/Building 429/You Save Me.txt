Hold your breath, take a step it's gonna be your day 
 They're asking you to speak the truth but you don't know what to say 
 Feel the fear creeping up like you were on a stage 
 You've had enough you're stepping up to say what you came to say 
 Say it just say it just say it 
 Say it just say it just say it 
 It's in my heart, it's in my soul, it's something that I can't let go 
 I come alive every time, I can feel You 
 All I am and all I'll be is different since You set me free 
 I come alive every time 
 Cause You save me, Lord You save me 
 You're feeling good just like you should but now you can feel the weight 
 Of people's eyes they pass you by hoping that you will fade 
 So live it just live it just live it 
 So live it just live it just say 
 It's in my heart, it's in my soul, it's something that I can't let go 
 I come alive every time, I can feel You 
 All I am and all I'll be is different since You set me free 
 I come alive every time 
 Cause You save me, Lord You save me 
 Cause this is not what we thought it would be 
 And this is why we gotta speak 
 Cause there is love oh there is hope 
 We gotta live it out, live it out so they will know 
 Just say it's in my heart, it's in my soul, it's something that I can't let go 
 I come alive every time I can feel You 
 All I am and all I'll be is different since You set me free 
 I come alive every time 
 Just say, just say 
 It's in my heart, it's in my soul, it's something that I can't let go 
 I come alive every time, I can feel You 
 All I am and all I'll be is different since You set me free 
 I come alive every time 
 Cause You save me, Lord You save me 
 You save me, You save me yeah 
 Hold your breath, take a step, it's gonna be your day

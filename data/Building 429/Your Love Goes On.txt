One foot slips and the ladder falls 
 One life sinks in the undertow 
 Still Your love goes on 
 One heart cries into the night 
 One life waits to begin again 
 Still Your love goes on and on 
 One taken far too soon 
 Our hopes and dreams left scarred 
 We've all been scarred 
 Still your love goes on, oh 
 I see it and I feel it 
 And we're not alone 
 I know that Your love goes on 
 One hope is never going to change 
 One truth is certain to the day 
 That your love goes on 
 One promised covered all our shame 
 One Savior died and took the pain 
 And His love goes on and on 
 One taken far too soon 
 Our hopes and dreams left scarred 
 We've all been scarred, yeah 
 Still your love goes on, oh 
 I see it and I feel it 
 And we're not alone, no 
 I know that Your love goes on 
 How many dreams are leaving you cold 
 You never know why 
 This is the hope that transcended through time 
 We've got this hope tonight 
 One hope is never going to change 
 One truth is certain to the day, today 
 Your love goes on, oh 
 I see it and I feel it 
 And we're not alone, no 
 I know that Your love goes on 
 Your love goes on 
 Your love will go on

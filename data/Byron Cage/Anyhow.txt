Tho' the storms in life will come 
 And sometimes I may feel alone 
 I can stand upon the promise 
 You won't leave me 
 In desperate times it causes me 
 It causes me to stay on my knees 
 So I will praise You anyhow 
 With tears, streaming down my face 
 I'll put on the garment of praise 
 There'd no trouble that will come 
 That you won't help me 
 The enemy has to flee 
 I already have victory 
 So I will praise Him anyhow 
 Anyhow, anyhow, anyhow 
 I'll praise You anyhow 
 The trials that come 
 They sometimes come to make me strong 
 For Your strength is made perfect 
 In my weakness 
 You promised to supply my needs 
 And that you will never leave 
 So I will praise You anyhow 
 After You've done everything 
 I'm not sure what the day will bring 
 But, by faith I'll wait on You, Lord 
 Because You're right there 
 And even when I want to give in 
 I'll hold out until the end 
 For I will praise You anyhow 
 Hallelujah, anyhow, anyhow 
 Just keep on, praise Him, Oh anyhow, anyhow 
 Hallelujah, any how 
 I'll praise Him anyhow 
 I'll praise Him anyhow 
 I'll praise Him anyhow 
 I'll praise Him anyhow

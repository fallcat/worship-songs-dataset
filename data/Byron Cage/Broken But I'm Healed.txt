So you enter into this building, 
 You brought your burdens, brought your pain. 
 I have a message for you today, 
 That when you leave here, you won't be the same. 
 So you tell me you've been to your physician, 
 Look at you there's been no change in your condition. 
 Reach out and touch the Master's Throne, 
 There's healing for your mind, your body, and your soul. 
 God can heal, He can deliver. 
 He can mend your brokenness. 
 He has a miracle to fit your needs, 
 Once you trust Him, you will receive. 
 God knows about your situation, 
 But with every test and every trial there is revelation, 
 That God is able to supply every one of your needs; 
 He's here to touch you, heal you, He'll set you free. 
 So by the time that you leave this building, 
 My prayer for everyone in here is that you'll have your healing. 
 Once God works a miracle to fit your need, 
 Go tell the world, what you have received. 
 God has healed, He has delivered. 
 He has mended my brokenness. 
 Gave me a miracle to fit my need; 
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord. 
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, I have received. 
 Ending: 
 I have received.

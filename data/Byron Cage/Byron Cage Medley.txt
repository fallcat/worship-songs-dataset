Yet praise him 
 Magnify the Lord 
 Yet praise him 
 Clap your hands all ye people 
 Shout unto the Lord praise 
 Sing unto the Lord 
 A new song 
 Shout unto the Lord with praise 
 Sing unto Him all the earth 
 Make a joyful sound and bless His 
 Holy name 
 Let the high praises of God be heard 
 Sing unto Him all the earth 
 Yet praise him 
 Magnify the Lord 
 Yet praise him 
 Glorify his name 
 Yet praise him 
 In trouble 
 Yet praise him 
 Lord, we lift you him up 
 Yet praise him

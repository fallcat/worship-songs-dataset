 Is there anything impossible? 
 (No, no, no, no) 
 Will He withhold any good thing from you, say 
 (No, no, no, no, no)

 (No, no, no, no, no) 
 That which He's spoken 
 He's faithful to perform 
 It will come to pass 
 If we believe and we speak, He can do anything 
 Exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think 
 He is able to turn the tables in my favor 
 If we're faith, faithful to believe

 I believe there's a God who knows 
 The path in life and where things should go 
 That means that even if a door should close 
 Somewhere out there, there's a window for sure 
 If we don't get presents that can't be changed 
 And we've done so much we gotta give it away 
 (Now that's the kind of blessings that I'm talkin' about) 
 Trust, believe, expect, no doubt 
 If you have itty bitty mustard seed faith 
 Then even mountains gotta get out the way 
 All I wanna get you really, really to believe 
 Is that He is faithful, I'm faithful to believe 
 I believe, I believe, I believe, faithful to believe 
 I believe, I believe, I believe, faithful to believe 
 If we believe and we speak, He can do anything 
 Exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think 
 He is able to turn the tables in my favor 
 If we're faith, faithful to believe 
 I believe, yes, yes, I do believe 
 (I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah) 
 I believe, yes, yes, I do believe 
 (I believe, yes, yes, I do believe) 
 If we believe and we speak, He can do anything 
 Exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think 
 He is able to turn the tables in my favor 
 If we're faith, faithful to believe

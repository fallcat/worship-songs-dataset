As much as this hurts I have to let you go 
 I wanted to still say yes but I gotta say no 
 I admit I've been down this road before 
 And I wanted to let you in 
 But I gotta close the door 
 I really wish things could gone another way 
 But the painful memories of my past 
 Makes me have to stand and say 
 Oh oh oh 
 It's a brand new season 
 Oh oh oh 
 It's a brand new day 
 Oh oh oh 
 I'm no longer affected 
 Oh oh oh 
 By what you do 
 Oh oh oh 
 I guess that I should thank you 
 Oh oh oh 
 For opening my eyes 
 Oh oh oh 
 I'm looking for my future 
 And it looks better for my life 
 Goodbye 
 I'm over your opinion 
 Your hurt and your lies 
 I believe in what you say 
 When you see me through his eyes 
 Victorious and more than a conqueror 
 Is who I am 
 So I bid farewell to the ones 
 Who could never understand 
 Sometimes this life has cost me tears 
 But the bigger one still lives in me 
 Which is the reason I'm still here to say 
 Oh oh oh 
 It's a new season 
 Oh oh oh 
 It's a brand new day 
 Oh oh oh 
 I'm no longer affected 
 Oh oh oh 
 By the things you do 
 Oh oh oh 
 I guess that I should thank you 
 Oh oh oh 
 For opening my eyes 
 Oh oh oh 
 I'm looking toward the future 
 And it looks better for my life. 
 I gotta say no 
 Goodbye 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I don't need you in my life 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Goodbye 
 Listen 
 Gotta move on with my life 
 Stand up give it another try 
 Say goodbye to what had me bound 
 Fully embarrassed who loves me now 
 All the hurt and guilt and shame 
 All the ones who tried to damage my name 
 For all the ones who smiled in my face 
 But talked about me when I walked away 
 To all the haters that want to tear you down 
 And the trouble wants to keep you bound 
 I get joy every time I think about 
 That I am his and that there is no doubt 
 You don't have the power your not in control 
 You didn't die for me you didn't save my soul 
 Even though you thought that I can never take it 
 Say what you want I still know I'm going to make it 
 Oh oh oh 
 It's a new season 
 Oh oh oh 
 It's a brand new day 
 Oh oh oh 
 I'm no longer affected 
 Oh oh oh 
 By the things you do 
 Oh oh oh 
 I guess that I should thank you 
 Oh oh oh 
 For opening my eyes 
 Oh oh oh 
 I'm looking toward the future 
 And it looks better for my life. 
 I gotta say no 
 Goodbye 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Goodbye

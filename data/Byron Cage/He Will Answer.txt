He will answer when you call 
 He never sleeps, He never slumbers 
 Pick you up each time you fall 
 No need to ask no need to wonder 
 Yes, He sees you kneeling 
 Yes, He's already dealing 
 He will answer, He will answer 
 When you call 
 He will answer when you call 
 Don't have to fret, don't have to worry 
 He will be there through it all 
 May take some time, may be a hurry 
 Yes, His word is honest, Y 
 Yes, you'll make it I promise 
 He will answer, He will answer 
 When you call a batch of angels dispatch 
 Don't fear, they're on their way 
 Issues have no choice 
 His name, His voice 
 The earth, the winds obey 
 He sees you kneeling 
 Yes, He's already dealing 
 He will answer, He will answer 
 When you call 
 He sees you kneeling 
 Yes, He's already dealing 
 He will answer, He will answer 
 He will answer, He will answer 
 When you call

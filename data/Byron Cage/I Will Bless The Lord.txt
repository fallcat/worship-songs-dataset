Magnify the Lord with me, 
 Whom the Son, He hath redeemed. 
 Clap your hands, rejoice, and sing, 
 You are Lord of everything. 
 I will bless the Lord, 
 Bless the Lord at all times. 
 I will bless the Lord, 
 Bless the Lord at all times. 
 For the Lord our God is great, 
 Perfect Lord, in all Your ways. 
 God of mercy, Lord of grace, 
 Holy One, Ancient of days. 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 And all that's within me bless His name. 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 And all that's within me bless His name.

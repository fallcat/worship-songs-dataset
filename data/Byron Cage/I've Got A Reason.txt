If you know you've gotta reason to praise Him 
 Tell some of the people real quick, say 
 "I've gotta reason to praise Him" 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To clap my hands, to clap my hands 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To sing and dance to sing and dance 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To lift my voice to lift my voice 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason to rejoice 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason to rejoice 
 For life strength and health 
 For joy and peace of mind 
 For Your divine favor 
 For being a merciful Savior 
 Even when I seem faithless 
 Your love is never changing 
 An ever patient and loving God you are 
 That's why I give you all the praise 
 And I say I've gotta reason 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To clap my hands, to clap my hands 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To sing and dance to sing and dance 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To lift my voice to lift my voice 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason to rejoice 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason to rejoice 
 When I think of His goodness 
 And everything He's done 
 You don't understand why I'm clapping 
 My hands like this today 'cause I've already won 
 He's given me the victory out of the hands of the enemy 
 So excuse me while I give God all of the glory 
 Because I know I've been redeemed, whoa 
 I've gotta reason 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To clap my hands, to clap my hands 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To sing and dance to sing and dance 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason 
 To lift my voice to lift my voice 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason to rejoice 
 I've gotta reason, I've gotta reason to rejoice 
 This is why, now who has brought us 
 Taught us along the way 
 Our total praise be yours today 
 Oh, God of mercy we declare Your name 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus

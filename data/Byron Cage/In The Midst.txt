I need about a thousand of you to jump up on your feet 
 And give God some in the midst praise 
 In the midst of what I'm going through 
 Come on 
 Come on y'all 
 God we are showing you in this room 
 That we know how to praise you 
 In the midst of everything that we're going through 
 Come on, come on, come on 
 Come on put your hands together 
 Thank you God that we know how to praise you 
 In the midst of our struggles 
 And everything that we deal with 
 Hallelujah! 
 Come on let's say it like this 
 (Byron sings) 
 In the midst of pain 
 In the midst of tears 
 In the midst of struggles 
 In the midst of all who's here 
 I got a word from heaven 
 Just to let you know 
 That the things you're facing 
 You can't conquer on your own 
 When it still looks like 
 There's no hope in sight 
 But I got good news 
 This is what you need to do 
 When the trouble comes 
 It's not the time to quit 
 But throw up both your hands 
 Praise Him in the midst 
 Of my trials 
 He'll be a present help in trouble 
 In the rain, don't bend 
 Just fight until the end 
 Tye Tribbett make some noise 
 (Tye tribbett sings) 
 Now I was on my knees 
 And you couldn't have known, oh 
 'Cause the things I'm facing 
 I can't conquer on my own 
 But my hope and trust is in what you said 
 I cast all my cares on you 
 Praise Him in the midst 
 Of my trials 
 He'll be a present help in trouble 
 In the rain, (don't give in) don't bend 
 Just fight until the end 
 Clap your hands like this y'all 
 (Choir sings) Praise Him in the midst 
 (Tye sings) In the midst of recession, oppression, life stressing 
 (Choir sings) In the midst 
 (Byron) In the midst of high prices, gas prices, I will 
 (Choir sings) In the midst 
 (Tye) Some times life causes me to lose my breath 
 (Choir) In the midst and I will praise Him 
 In the midst 
 Ooh 
 In the midst 
 I'm gonna lift my hands and give you the glory 
 In the midst 
 Ooh 
 In the midst I'll praise his name 
 Everybody just clap 
 Ooh 
 Over here now 
 Now everybody just clap your hands 
 Come on come on 
 And when it gets real hard this is what you gotta do Tye 
 Say, hold on 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 Trials don't last always 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 You're gonna make it 
 Hooooold 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 Trials won't last always 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 You're gonna make it 
 In pain 
 Hold on 
 In sickness I'll hold on 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 Yes I will 
 I'm gonna praise you Jesus 
 In the midst of it all 
 All you gotta do is hold on 
 Clap your hands everybody 
 We made a decision tonight 
 That we will bless the Lord at all times 
 That means good times 
 That means bad times 
 Anybody came to bless the Lord sing!

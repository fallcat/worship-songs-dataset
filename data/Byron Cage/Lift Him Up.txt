No matter what the problem may be, 
 He's in control and He knows everything. 
 I have the victory for He is my King, 
 In Him I live, move, and I have my being. 
 Let the people lift Him up, 
 Rejoice, and shout unto Him. 
 For You have caused us to triumph 
 And we know we will rule in the end. 
 Vamp 1: 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up, 
 Lift Him up higher and higher. 
 Vamp 2: 
 Higher, higher, higher, 
 Higher and higher. 
 (Vamp 1)

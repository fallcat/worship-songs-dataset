(Byron cage) 
 You are everything, my love, my joy, my song, my peace... all the day long 
 Oh and everything is you, you're the air I breathe, you're the song that I sing, (my Lord) 
 You are everything 
 (Karen clark-sheard) 
 You are everything, my love, my joy, my song, my peace... (Oh) all the day long 
 And everything is you; you're the air that I breathe, and the song that I sing,

Praise Him, praise Him, 
 Praise Him in the morning, 
 Praise Him in the noonday. 
 Praise Him, praise Him, 
 Praise Him when the sun goes down. 
 When I wake up in the morning, 
 The first thing I like to do is lift my hands 
 And tell God, "thank You", 
 'Cause He's the one that helped me make it through. 
 All the glory, all the honor, 
 We will give to You right now, 
 Father, Son and Holy Ghost power, 
 We should... 
 (Praise Him in the morning), 
 (Praise Him in the noonday), 
 (Praise Him when the sun goes...) 
 (Sopranos: down...) 
 (Altos: down...) 
 (Tenors: down...) 
 Love Him, love Him, 
 Love Him in the morning, 
 Love Him in the noonday. 
 Love Him, love Him, 
 Love Him when the sun goes down. 
 With my hands, I will bless Him. 
 With my voice, I will sing His praises. 
 With a dance, I will bless Him. 
 I will shout for joy every chance I get. 
 With my hands, I will bless Him. 
 With my voice, I will sing His praises. 
 With a dance, I will bless Him. 
 I will shout for joy... 
 Vamp 1: 
 I will praise Him, 
 I will praise Him, 
 I will praise Him. 
 Vamp 2: 
 Praise, praise, 
 Praise, praise. 
 Praise, praise, praise, 
 Vamp 3: 
 Praise Him. 
 Ending: 
 Praise Him in the morning, 
 Praise Him in the noonday, 
 Praise Him when the sun goes... 
 [Sopranos:] down... 
 [Altos:] down... 
 [Tenors:] down... 
 [All:] Praise Him.

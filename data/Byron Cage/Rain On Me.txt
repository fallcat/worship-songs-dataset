You are King of all Kings, Lord above all, 
 God of my praise, You are my song. 
 I'll praise you with my every breath, 
 Glorious God, in You I rest. 
 Great is the mercy of you oh God 
 I honor your presence in this sanctuary. 
 I will exalt and I'll lift Your name high, 
 Allow your blessings to fall. 
 Lord fill this temple with mercy and love, 
 Allow it to flow freely here in my heart 
 My soul is thirsty for drops from you Lord, 
 Allow your blessings to fall on me. 
 From this time forth and forevermore 
 (I promise I'll) bless your name, oh. 
 From this time forth and forevermore 
 Bless your name, oh God, oh God

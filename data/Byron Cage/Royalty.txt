You're in the presence of royalty 
 It's our sovereign God and king 
 We're before your thrown 
 We bow at our feet 
 We worship you holy king 
 It's in your presence that I find joy 
 It's in your presence that I find peace 
 I find rest for my soul 
 And strength for my life 
 Lying here at your feet 
 (Choir) 
 We're in the presence of royalty 
 It's our sovereign God and King 
 We're before your thrown 
 And bow at your feet 
 We worship you Holy King 
 It's in your presence that I find joy 
 It's in your presence that I find peace 
 I find rest for my soul 
 And strength for my life 
 Lying here at your feet [repeat 1x] 
 (Choir) 
 In your presence there's the fullness of joy 
 And in your right hand are pleasures forevermore 
 Ah let the nations sing 
 The people rejoice 
 Holy one above all 
 Your matchless name we will call 
 Ah bowing down before you 
 Worship you only 
 We're in the presence of royalty 
 It's our sovereign God and King 
 Were before your thrown 
 And bow at your feet 
 Worship you Holy King 
 (Choir) 
 We're in the presence of royalty 
 It's our sovereign God and King 
 Were before your thrown 
 And bow at your feet 
 Worship you Holy King 
 (Choir) 
 We're in the presence of royalty [14x] 
 Were in the presence of royalty 
 It's or sovereign God and king 
 I find rest for my soul 
 Strength for my life 
 Lying here at your feet

I still say, "Yes!" No matter what the test 
 I still say, "Yes!" No matter what the test 
 Going all over 
 In His name 
 Moving by the power 
 Of Jesus name 
 Gotta cross over 
 By His blood 
 Gotta keep Satan 
 On the run 
 [Sop/Alt:] Gotta keep praying 
 [T:] Gotta keep saying 
 [ALL:] Yes! 
 I still say "Yes... 
 Climbing high mountains 
 In His name 
 Treading in the valley 
 In Jesus name 
 My heart is fixed 
 By His grace 
 My heart is ready 
 By His faith 
 [Sop/Alt:] Gotta keep praying 
 [T:] Gotta keep sayin' 
 [ALL:] Yes! 
 Yes to Your will 
 Yes to Your way 
 Yes to Your word 
 Yes all the day 
 Yes in the good 
 Yes in the bad 
 Vamp: 
 Still say yes 
 My soul yes 
 Still say 
 My soul say yes, say yes 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Yes! 
 Ending: 
 [Sop/Alt:] Gotta keep praying 
 [T:] Gotta keep sayin' 
 [ALL:] Yes!

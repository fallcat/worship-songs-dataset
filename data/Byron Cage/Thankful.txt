When you see me and tears are falling from my eyes 
 Its because I'm thankful, thankful 
 And you see me dancing around and you're wondering why 
 (It's because I'm thankful) it's because I'm thankful 
 For when I think about your goodness 
 And all the ways you've made for me 
 I did nothing to deserve it 
 It's just you keep blessing me 
 And without your tender mercy 
 I don't know where I would be 
 Makes me say I'm thankful, (to everything you've done Jesus) thankful 
 I'm thankful (anybody in this room tonight) 
 It's because I'm thankful (listen here) 
 When I remember where I was and where I am right now 
 It makes me say I'm thankful, thankful (listen) 
 The lord lifted my hands when I felt like throwing in the towel 
 Lord that's why I'm thankful [lord that's why I'm thankful] 
 Cause you were not there when my life was hurting but somehow god he brought me though (yes he did) 
 And what the enemy meant for my evil god you turned it around for my good 
 And there never was a moment when you left my there alone 
 Ooh that's why I'm thankful (any thankful people in this room today?) thankful 
 (I'm so thankful) it's because I'm thankful 
 (For the times you've stood by me) for the times you've stood by me 
 (When all around) when all around I walked away 
 And the sins I committed against you Jesus 
 Because of the blood lord you forgave me 
 (Thank you lord) thank you lord for every blessing, and new mercy every day 
 Thankful (yes lord I am) thankful 
 (I need to know how many thankful people are in this room can say I'm thankful) 
 (If you're really thankful come on someone tell him again) it's because I'm thankful, thankful 
 (Come on tell him) it's because I'm thankful 
 Thankful 13x 
 It's because I'm thankful

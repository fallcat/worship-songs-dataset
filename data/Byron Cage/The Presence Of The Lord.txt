 Can't you see Him working on the outside 
 I can see Him moving on the inside 
 So come and enter in and cast your cares on Him 
 He'll open up a window and pour you out a blessing 
 'Cause when the Lord steps in He brings everything you need 
 Healing, power, and victory 
 Said it's all up to you, whatever you need Him to do 
 Just trust Him and believe and then by faith you will receive 
 I can feel the presence of the Lord and I'm gonna get my blessing right now (7x's) 
 The blessing of the Lord is here

There is a name like no other name 
 Whenever the name's declared 
 Your healing's there 
 And the lost are saved 
 Every knee will bow 
 And every tongue confess 
 That He is Lord of all 
 The sovereign One forever more 
 All authority in Heaven and on the earth 
 Is Yours and Yours alone 
 Oh, Lord of host the holy One 
 There is a name like no other name 
 Whenever the name's declared 
 Your healing's there 
 And the lost are saved 
 Lord, inhabit all the praise 
 That we give You in this place 
 You loosed the chains of bondage 
 Now we're free because of Your name 
 He gave His life at Calvary 
 Up on that rugged cross 
 To give the world salvation 
 And then He gave the hope 
 To every sinner lost 
 The name, the name so holy 
 The name, the one and only 
 The name, the name so worthy 
 The name, no other name 
 The name, the name so precious 
 The name, the name so righteous 
 Tell me who can stand against me 
 When I call that name 
 We will proclaim 
 The name that's above all names 
 Jesus 
 The name that's above all names

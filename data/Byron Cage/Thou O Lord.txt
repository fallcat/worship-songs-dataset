Lord how are they increased that trouble me 
 Many are they that rise up against me 
 Many there be that say of my soul 
 There is no help for him in God. 
 But thou oh Lord are a shield for me 
 My glory, you lift my head 
 But thou oh Lord are a shield for me 
 You're my glory, the lifter up of my head. 
 I cried to the Lord with my voice, 
 And he heard me out of his Holy hill. 
 I laid me down... and I slept 
 I wait for the Lord to save me. 
 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people 
 That set themselves against me round about (x 2) 
 Chorus: x 2 with emosulation; 
 Tab: 
 Thank you for lifting (x3) my head 
 Thank you for lifting my head 
 Thank you for lifting (x3) my head 
 Lead end; you Lord are my glory, you lift my head.

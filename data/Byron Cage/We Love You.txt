We lift our voice to bless you 
 We lift our hands to reach you 
 We lift our hearts to love you 
 Holy is your wonder. 
 We present our bodies, A living sacrifice 
 Holy and acceptable, unto you, we love you. 
 We love you Lord, we love you [x3] 
 How can I repay you, For all you've done for me 
 How can I say thank you, A million times won't be 
 Enough 
 Strong and Mighty and Able 
 Prompt in granting your favor 
 My heart proclaims the truth 
 That I'm in love with you. 
 Vamp: 
 Good [x8] 
 Holy [x8] 
 Wonderful [x8] 
 Yeah [repeat...]

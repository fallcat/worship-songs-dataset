Break forth, with shouts of joy 
 Make melodies in your heart 
 Unto the Lord, our God is wise 
 And our God is great, consistent 
 Love that will never change 
 Break forth, with shouts of joy 
 Make melodies in your heart 
 Unto the Lord, our God is wise 
 And our God is great, consistent 
 Love that will never change 
 Dance with all of your might 
 Stand strong in the faith 
 In the end it will be all right 
 Every stronghold, it won't stand 
 Every trial has to end 
 I'll never, never, never never 
 I'll never, never, never, never 
 Oh, never never, never, never 
 With all of my might 
 With all of my might 
 With all of my might 
 With all of my might

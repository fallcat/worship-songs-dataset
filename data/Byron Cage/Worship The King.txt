Come let us ascend to the high place, 
 The holy mountain where God dwells. 
 Let us enter in, to the Holy place, 
 Worship the King, worship the King. 
 Worship the King, worship the King. 
 He is high and lifted up in this place. 
 Worship the King, worship the King. 
 He is high and lifted up in this place. 
 Ending: 
 Worship the King.

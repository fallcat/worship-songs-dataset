 Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus  (Bonus Track) 
 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus 
 Just to take Him at His word; 
 Just to rest upon His promise, 
 Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord." 
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! 
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! 
 O for grace to trust Him more! 
 I'm so glad I learned to trust Him, 
 Precious Jesus, Savior, friend; 
 And I know that He is with me, 
 Will be with me to the end. 
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! 
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! 
 O for grace to trust Him more! 
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! 
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! 
 O for grace to trust Him more! 
 O for grace to trust Him more!

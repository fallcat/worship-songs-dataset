Giver of every breath I breathe 
 Author of all eternity 
 Giver of every perfect thing 
 To You be the glory 
 Maker of Heaven and of Earth 
 No one can comprehend Your worth 
 King over all the universe 
 To You be the glory 
 And I am alive because I'm alive in You 
 And It's all because of Jesus I'm alive 
 It's all because the blood of Jesus Christ 
 That covers me and raised this dead man's life 
 It's all because of Jesus I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 Giver of every breath I breathe 
 Author of all eternity 
 Giver of every perfect thing 
 To You be the glory 
 Maker of Heaven and of Earth 
 No one can comprehend Your worth 
 King over all the universe 
 To You be the glory 
 And I am alive because I'm alive in You 
 And It's all because of Jesus I'm alive 
 It's all because the blood of Jesus Christ 
 That covers me and raised this dead man's life 
 It's all because of Jesus 
 Every sunrise sings Your praise 
 The universe cries out Your praise 
 I'm singing freedom all my days 
 Now that I'm alive 
 And It's all because of Jesus I'm alive 
 It's all because the blood of Jesus Christ 
 That covers me and raised this dead man's life 
 It's all because of Jesus 
 And It's all because of Jesus I'm alive 
 It's all because the blood of Jesus Christ 
 That covers me and raised this dead man's life 
 It's all because of Jesus 
 It's all because of Jesus I'm alive 
 It's all because the blood of Jesus Christ 
 That covers me and raised this dead man's life 
 It's all because of Jesus 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

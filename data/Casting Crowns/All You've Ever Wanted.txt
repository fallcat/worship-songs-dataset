I just looked up today 
 And realized how far away I am from where You are 
 You gave me life worth dying for 
 But between the altar and the door 
 I bought the lies that promised more 
 And here I go again 
 Lord, I know I let You down 
 But somehow, I will make You proud 
 I'll turn this sinking ship around 
 And make it back to You 
 But all my deeds and my good name 
 Are just dirty rags that tear and strain 
 To cover all my guilty stains 
 That You already washed away 
 ('Cause) All You've ever wanted 
 All You've ever wanted 
 All You've ever wanted was my heart 
 Freedom's arms are open 
 My chains have all been broken 
 Relentless love has called me from the start 
 And all You wanted was my heart 
 I was chasing healing when I'd been made well 
 I was fighting battles when You conquered hell 
 Living free but from a prison cell 
 Lord, I lay it down today 
 So I'll stop living off of how I feel 
 And start standing on Your truth revealed 
 Jesus is my strength, my shield 
 And He will never fail me 
 ('Cause) All You've ever wanted 
 All You've ever wanted 
 All You've ever wanted was my heart 
 Freedom's arms are open 
 My chains have all been broken 
 Relentless love has called me from the start 
 And all You wanted was my heart 
 No more chains, I've been set free 
 No more fighting battles You've won for me 
 Now in Christ, I stand complete 
 All You've ever wanted 
 All You've ever wanted 
 All You've ever wanted was my heart 
 (All You've ever wanted was my heart) 
 Freedom's arms are open 
 My chains have all been broken 
 Relentless love has called me from the start 
 And all You wanted was my heart 
 And all You wanted was my heart 
 (All You've ever wanted was my heart) 
 And all You wanted was my heart

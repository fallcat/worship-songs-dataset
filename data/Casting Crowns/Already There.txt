From where I'm standing 
 Lord, it's so hard for me to see 
 Where this is going 
 And where You're leading me 
 I wish I knew how 
 All my fears and all my questions 
 Are going to play out 
 In a world I can't control 
 Oh, oh 
 When I'm lost in the mystery 
 To You my future is a memory 
 'Cause You're already there 
 You're already there 
 Standing at the end of my life 
 Waiting on the other side 
 And You're already there 
 You're already there 
 From where You're standing 
 Lord, You see a grand design 
 That You imagined 
 When You breathed me into life 
 And all the chaos 
 Comes together in Your hands 
 Like a masterpiece, yeah 
 Of Your picture-perfect plan 
 When I'm lost in the mystery 
 To You my future is a memory 
 'Cause You're already there 
 You're already there 
 Standing at the end of my life 
 Waiting on the other side 
 And You're already there 
 You're already there 
 One day I'll stand before You 
 And look back on the life I've lived 
 I can't wait to enjoy the view 
 And see how all the pieces fit 
 One day I'll stand before You 
 And look back on the life I've lived 
 can't wait to enjoy the view 
 And see how all the pieces fit 
 One day I'll stand before You 
 And look back on the life I've lived 
 'Cause You're already there 
 You're already there 
 When I'm lost in the mystery 
 To You my future is a memory 
 'Cause You're already there 
 You're already there 
 Standing at the end of my life 
 Waiting on the other side 
 And You're already there 
 You're already there 
 You're already there

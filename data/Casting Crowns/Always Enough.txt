In a dry and weary land 
 Lord, You are the rain 
 In a sea of shattered ones 
 Your love comes rushing in 
 You hold the world within Your hands 
 And see each tear that falls 
 Through every fire and every storm 
 You're always enough, always enough 
 Your love is peace to the broken 
 Faith for the widow, hope for the orphan 
 Strength for the weak 
 Your love is the anthem of nations 
 Rings out through the ages 
 And You're always enough for me 
 You keep my heart in perfect peace 
 My life is in Your hands 
 When confusion hides my way 
 You're always enough, always enough 
 Your love is peace to the broken 
 Faith for the widow, hope for the orphan 
 Strength for the weak 
 Your love is the anthem of nations 
 Rings out through the ages 
 And You're always enough 
 I rejoice for my Savior reigns 
 I rejoice for He lives in me 
 God on high, He has set me free 
 And worthy is the Lord 
 I rejoice for my Savior reigns 
 I rejoice for He lives in me 
 God on high, He has set me free 
 And worthy is the Lord 
 Your love is peace to the broken 
 Faith for the widow, hope for the orphan 
 Strength for the weak 
 Your love is the anthem of nations 
 Rings out through the ages 
 And You're always enough for me 
 Your love is peace to the broken 
 Faith for the widow, hope for the orphan 
 Strength for the weak 
 Your love is the anthem of nations 
 Rings out through the ages 
 And You're always enough 
 I rejoice for my Savior reigns 
 I rejoice for He lives in me 
 God on high, He has set me free 
 And worthy is the Lord 
 In a dry and weary land 
 Lord, You are the rain

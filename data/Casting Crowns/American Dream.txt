All work no play may have made Jack a dull boy 
 But all work and no God has left Jack with a lost soul 
 But he's moving on full steam 
 He's chasing the American dream 
 And he's gonna give his family the finer things 
 Not this time son I've no time to waste 
 Maybe tomorrow we'll have time to play 
 And then he slips into his new BMW 
 And drives farther and farther and farther away 
 'Cause he works all day and tries to sleep at night 
 He says things will get better; 
 Better in time 
 So he works and he builds with his own two hands 
 And he pours all he has in a castle made with sand 
 But the wind and the rain are comin' crashing in 
 Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands 
 His kingdom stands 
 His American Dream is beginning to seem 
 More and more like a nightmare 
 With every passing day 
 "Daddy, can you come to my game?" 
 "Oh Baby, please don't work lake." 
 Another wasted weekend 
 And they are sipping away 
 'Cause he works all day and lies awake at night 
 He tells them things will get better 
 It'll just take a little more time 
 So he works and he builds with his own two hands 
 And he pours all he has in a castle made with sand 
 But the wind and the rain are comin' crashing in 
 Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands 
 His kingdom stands 
 He used to say, "Who ever dies with the most toys wins" 
 But if he loses his soul, what has he gained in the end 
 I'll take a shack on a rock 
 Over a castle in the sand 
 Now he works all day and cries alone at night 
 It's not getting any better 
 Looks like he's running out of time 
 'Cause he worked and he built with his own two hands 
 And he poured all he had in a castle made with sand 
 But the wind and the rain are coming crashing in 
 Time will tell just how long his kingdom stands 
 His kingdom stands 
 All they really wanted was you 
 All they really wanted was you 
 All they really wanted was you

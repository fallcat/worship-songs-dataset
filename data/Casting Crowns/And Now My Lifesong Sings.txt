I once was lost, but now I'm found 
 I once was lost, but now I'm found 
 So far away, but I'm home now 
 I once was lost, but now I'm found 
 And now my lifesong sings 
 I once was blind, but now I see 
 I once was blind, but now I see 
 I don't know how, but when He touched me 
 I once was blind, but now I see 
 And now my lifesong sings 
 And now my lifesong sings 
 And now my lifesong sings 
 I once was dead, but now I live 
 I once was dead, but now I live 
 Now my life to You I give 
 Now my life to You I give 
 Now my life to You I give 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Let my lifesong sing to You 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Let my lifesong sing to You 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Let my lifesong sing to You 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Let my lifesong sing to You

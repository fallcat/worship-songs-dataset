It was a day just like any other day 
 I was a boy just like every other boy 
 When a girl unlike any I had seen 
 It's like she stepped out of a dream 
 And into my world 
 It could've been the summer wind 
 Playing with her hair 
 As the sun danced in her eyes 
 We were standing there 
 She smiled, I forgot my name 
 'Cause all I was thinking 
 Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying 
 That an angel will love me, an angel will love me 
 Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling 
 Asking Heaven above me for an angel to love me 
 The rest of my life 
 The rest of my life 
 You're the proof that the Father answers prayer 
 Because somehow, some way 
 You and I are standing here 
 With a sacred promise and a ring that says it all 
 Oh, I've just begun to fall 
 And from the deepest part of me I say "I do" 
 Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying 
 That an angel will love me, an angel will love me 
 Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling 
 Asking Heaven above me for an angel to love me 
 And after all the changing seasons have turned to years 
 The crowds are gone and the songs have faded 
 I'll still be here 
 Holding you and thanking Heaven for my angel 
 Maybe I'm crazy but I'm praying 
 That an angel will love me, an angel will love me 
 Maybe I'm crazy for praying an angel will love me 
 Maybe I'm a fool but I'm still falling 
 Asking Heaven above me for an angel to love me 
 The rest of my life 
 The rest of my life 
 Angel 
 The rest of my life 
 The rest of my life

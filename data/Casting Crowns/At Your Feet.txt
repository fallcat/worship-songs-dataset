Here at Your feet, I lay my past down 
 My wanderings, all my mistakes down 
 And I am free 
 Here at Your feet, I lay this day down 
 Not in my strength, but in Yours I've found 
 All I need, You're all I need 
 Jesus, Jesus at Your feet 
 Oh, to dwell and never leave 
 Jesus, Jesus, at Your feet 
 There is nowhere else for me 
 There is nowhere else for me 
 Here at Your feet, I lay my future down 
 All of my dreams, I give to You now 
 And I find peace, I find peace 
 Jesus, Jesus at Your feet 
 Oh, to dwell and never leave 
 Jesus, Jesus, at Your feet 
 There is nowhere else for me 
 There is nowhere else for me 
 Here at Your feet, I lay my life down 
 For You my King, You're all I want now 
 And my soul sings... 
 Jesus, Jesus at Your feet 
 Oh, to dwell and never leave 
 Jesus, Jesus, at Your feet 
 There is nowhere else for me 
 There is nowhere else for me 
 'Cause I am free (here at Your feet) 
 All I need (is at Your feet) 
 And I find peace 
 We're at Your feet 
 We're at Your feet 
 And I am free (here at Your feet) 
 All I need (is at Your feet) 
 I find peace 
 We're at Your feet 
 We're at Your feet 
 We're at Your feet 
 We're at Your feet 
 Here at Your feet 
 I lay my life down

Up Calvary's mountain one dreadful morn 
 Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn 
 Facing for sinners death on the cross 
 That He might save them from endless loss 
 Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer 
 Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree 
 Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading 
 Blind and unheeding, dying for me 
 "Father, forgive them," my Savior prayed 
 Even while His lifeblood flowed fast away 
 Praying for sinners while in such woe 
 No one but Jesus ever loved so 
 Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer 
 Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree 
 Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading 
 Blind and unheeding, dying for me 
 Dying for me 
 Dying for me 
 Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer 
 Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree 
 Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading 
 Blind and unheeding, dying for me 
 Oh how I love Him, Savior and friend 
 How can my praises ever find end 
 Through years unnumbered on Heaven's shore 
 My songs shall praise Him forevermore 
 Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer 
 Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree 
 Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading 
 Blind and unheeding, dying for me 
 Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer 
 Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree 
 Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading 
 Blind and unheeding, dying for me 
 Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer

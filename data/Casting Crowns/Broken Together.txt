What do you think about when you look at me? 
 I know were not the fairytale you dreamed we'd be 
 You wore the veil, you walked the aisle, you took my hand 
 And we dove into a mystery 
 How I wish we could go back to simpler times 
 Before all our scars and all our secrets were in the light 
 Now on this hallowed ground, we've drawn the battle lines 
 Will we make it through the night? 
 It's going to take much more than promises this time 
 Only God can change our minds 
 Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete 
 Could we just be broken together? 
 If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine 
 Could healing still be spoken and save us? 
 The only way we'll last forever is broken together 
 How it must have been so lonely by my side 
 We were building kingdoms and chasing dreams and left love behind 
 I'm praying God will help our broken hearts align 
 And we won't give up the fight 
 It's going to take much more than promises this time 
 Only God can change our minds 
 Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete 
 Could we just be broken together? 
 If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine 
 Could healing still be spoken and save us? 
 The only way we'll last forever is broken together 
 Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete 
 Could we just be broken together? 
 If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine 
 Could healing still be spoken and save us? 
 The only way we'll last forever is broken together

Did you hear of the city on the hill? 
 Said one old man to the other 
 It once shined bright and it would be shining still 
 But they all started turning on each other 
 You see, the poets thought the dancers were shallow 
 And the soldiers thought the poets were weak 
 And the elders saw the young ones as foolish 
 And the rich man never heard the poor man speak 
 And one by one, they ran away 
 With their made-up minds to leave it all behind 
 And the light began to fade in the city on the hill 
 The city on the hill 
 Each one thought that they knew better 
 But they were different by design 
 Instead of standing strong together 
 They let their differences divide 
 And one by one, they ran away 
 With their made-up minds to leave it all behind 
 And the light began to fade in the city on the hill 
 The city on the hill 
 And the world is searching still 
 But it was the rhythm of the dancers 
 That gave the poets life 
 It was the spirit of the poets 
 That gave the soldiers strength to fight 
 It was the fire of the young ones 
 It was the wisdom of the old 
 It was the story of the poor man 
 That needed to be told 
 It is the rhythm of the dancers 
 That gives the poets life 
 It is the spirit of the poets 
 That gives the soldiers strength to fight 
 It is the fire of the young ones 
 It is the wisdom of the old 
 It is the story of the poor man 
 That's needing to be told 
 One by one, will we run away 
 With our made-up minds to leave it all behind 
 As the light begins to fade in the city on the hill 
 One by one, will we run away 
 With our made-up minds to leave it all behind 
 As the light begins to fade in the city on the hill 
 The city on the hill 
 Come home 
 And the Father's calling still 
 Come home to the city on the hill 
 Come home

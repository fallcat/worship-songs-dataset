We were made to be courageous 
 We were made to lead the way 
 We could be the generation 
 That finally breaks the chains 
 We were made to be courageous 
 We were made to be courageous 
 We were warriors on the frontlines 
 Standing unafraid 
 But now we're watchers on the sidelines 
 While our families slip away 
 Where are you, men of courage 
 You were made for so much more 
 Let the pounding of our hearts cry 
 "We will serve the Lord" 
 We were made to be courageous 
 And we're taking back the fight 
 We were made to be courageous 
 And it starts with us tonight 
 The only way we'll ever stand 
 Is on our knees with lifted hands 
 Make us courageous 
 Lord, make us courageous 
 This is our resolution 
 Our answer to the call 
 We will love our wives and children 
 We refuse to let them fall 
 We will reignite the passion that we bury deep inside 
 May the watchers become warriors 
 Let the men of God arise 
 We were made to be courageous 
 And we're taking back the fight 
 We were made to be courageous 
 And it starts with us tonight 
 The only way we'll ever stand 
 Is on our knees with lifted hands 
 Make us courageous 
 Lord, make us courageous 
 Seek justice, love mercy 
 Walk humbly with your God 
 Seek justice, love mercy 
 Walk humbly with your God 
 In the war of the mind I will make my stand 
 In the battle of the heart and the battle of the hand 
 In the war of the mind I will make my stand 
 In the battle of the heart and the battle of the hand 
 We were made to be courageous 
 And we're taking back the fight 
 We were made to be courageous 
 And it starts with us tonight 
 The only way we'll ever stand 
 Is on our knees with lifted hands 
 Make us courageous 
 Lord, make us courageous 
 We were made to be courageous 
 Lord, make us courageous 
 Seek justice, love mercy 
 We were made to be courageous 
 Lord, make us courageous 
 Seek justice, love mercy 
 Walk humbly with your God

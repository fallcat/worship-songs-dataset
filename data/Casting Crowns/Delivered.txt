I love the Lord 
 He heard my voice 
 When I was in great need 
 He saved me 
 I love the Lord 
 He heard my voice 
 When I was in great need 
 He saved me 
 Be at rest once more 
 Oh my soul 
 For the Lord has been good 
 To you 
 For you Oh Lord have delivered my soul from death 
 And you my Lord have delivered my eyes from tears 
 And you Oh Lord have delivered my feet from stumbling 
 That I may walk with you, that I may walk with you 
 I love the Lord 
 He heard my voice 
 When I was in great need 
 He saved me 
 I love the Lord 
 He heard my voice 
 When I was in great need 
 He saved me 
 Be at rest once more 
 Oh my soul 
 For the lord has been good 
 To you 
 For you Oh Lord have delivered my soul from death 
 And you my Lord have delivered my eyes from tears 
 And you Oh Lord have delivered my feet from stumbling 
 That I may walk with you, that I may walk with you 
 For you Oh Lord have delivered my soul from death 
 And you my Lord have delivered my eyes from tears 
 And you Oh Lord have delivered my feet from stumbling 
 That I may walk with you, that I may walk with you 
 That I may walk with you 
 That I may walk with you

She is running 
 A hundred miles an hour in the wrong direction 
 She is trying 
 But the canyon's ever widening 
 In the depths of her cold heart 
 So she sets out on another misadventure just to find 
 She's another two years older 
 And she's three more steps behind 
 Does anybody hear her? 
 Can anybody see? 
 Or does anybody even know she's going down today 
 Under the shadow of our steeple 
 With all the lost and lonely people 
 Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me 
 Does anybody hear her? 
 Can anybody see? 
 She is yearning 
 For shelter and affection 
 That she never found at home 
 She is searching 
 For a hero to ride in 
 To ride in and save the day 
 And in walks her prince charming 
 And he knows just what to say 
 Momentary lapse of reason 
 And she gives herself away 
 Does anybody hear her? 
 Can anybody see? 
 Or does anybody even know she's going down today 
 Under the shadow of our steeple 
 With all the lost and lonely people 
 Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me 
 Does anybody hear her? 
 Can anybody see? 
 If judgment looms under every steeple 
 If lofty glances from lofty people 
 Can't see past her scarlet letter 
 And we never even met her 
 If judgment looms under every steeple 
 If lofty glances from lofty people 
 Can't see past her scarlet letter 
 And we never even met her 
 Never even met her 
 Never even met her 
 Does anybody hear her? 
 Does anybody see? 
 Or does anybody even know she's going down today 
 Under the shadow of our steeple 
 With all the lost and lonely people 
 Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me 
 Does anybody hear her? 
 Does anybody see? 
 Does anybody even know she's going down today 
 Under the shadow of our steeple 
 With all the lost and lonely people 
 Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me 
 Does anybody hear her? 
 Does anybody see? 
 He is running

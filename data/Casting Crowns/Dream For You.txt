Hey, David, I hear you've been dreaming 
 About being a big time shepherd some day 
 You're gonna prove your brothers wrong 
 You're gonna sing your shepherd song 
 To the cattle on a thousand hills 
 But I've been thinking 
 I'm having trouble with a giant down the road 
 You're the one who's going to face him toe to toe 
 Wipe that grin right off his face 
 And whip this army into shape 
 I'm going to turn the nation back to Me 
 And David, you're right about one thing 
 Your little shepherd songs are going to make the whole world sing 
 And I'm gonna make you king 
 So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you 
 I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you 
 So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand 
 I'll show you what I can do 
 When I dream for you 
 I have a dream for you 
 Hey Mary, I've heard you've been dreaming 
 Making plans for your big wedding day 
 You and Joseph are gonna be 
 The picture perfect family 
 Maybe a couple of kids down the road 
 But I've been thinking 
 Even before time began 
 I had a picture perfect plan 
 Of how to save this broken world 
 Through the life of just one man 
 I'm gonna send my only Son 
 And Mary, you're the one 
 You were right about one thing 
 You're gonna have that family 
 And you're gonna raise a King 
 So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you 
 I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you 
 So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand 
 I'll show you what I can do 
 When I dream for you 
 When I dream for you 
 I'm stronger than you think I am 
 I'll take you farther than you think you can 
 You sing and call me Great I Am 
 So take your stand 
 My child, if you only knew 
 All the plans that I have for you 
 Just trust me, I will follow through 
 You can follow Me 
 So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you 
 I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you 
 So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand 
 I'll show you what I can do 
 So come on, let Me dream, let Me dream for you 
 I am strong when you're weak and I'll carry you 
 So let go of your plan, be caught by My hand 
 I'll show you what I can do 
 When I dream for you 
 When I dream for you 
 When I dream for you 
 I have a dream for you

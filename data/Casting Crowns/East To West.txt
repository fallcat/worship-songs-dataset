Here I am, Lord, and I'm drowning in Your sea of forgetfulness 
 The chains of yesterday surround me 
 I yearn for peace and rest 
 I don't want to end up where You found me 
 And it echoes in my mind, keeps me awake tonight 
 I know You've cast my sin as far as the east is from the west 
 And I stand before You now as though I've never sinned 
 But today I feel like I'm just one mistake away from You leaving me this way 
 Jesus, can You show me just how far the east is from the west 
 'Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been come rising up in me again 
 In the arms of Your mercy I find rest 
 'Cause You know just how far the east is from the west 
 From one scarred hand to the other 
 I start the day, the war begins, endless reminding of my sin 
 Time and time again Your truth is drowned out by the storm I'm in 
 Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away from You leaving me this way 
 Jesus, can You show me just how far the east is from the west 
 'Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been come rising up in me again 
 In the arms of Your mercy I find rest 
 'Cause You know just how far the east is from the west 
 From one scarred hand to the other 
 I know You've washed me white, turned my darkness into light 
 I need Your peace to get me through, to get me through this night 
 I can't live by what I feel, but by the truth Your word reveals 
 I'm not holding on to You, but You're holding on to me 
 You're holding on to me 
 Jesus, You know just how far the east is from the west 
 I don't have to see the man I've been come rising up in me again 
 In the arms of Your mercy I find rest 
 'Cause You know just how far the east is from the west 
 From one scarred hand to the other 
 Just how far the east is from the west 
 Just how far 
 One scarred hand to the other 
 You know just how far the east is from the west 
 Just how far 
 From one scarred hand to the other

I'm the man with all I've ever wanted 
 All the toys and playing games 
 I am the one who pours your coffee, corner booth each Saturday 
 I am your daughter's favorite teacher 
 I am the leader of the band 
 I sit behind you in the bleachers 
 I am every man 
 I'm the coach of every winning team and still a loser in my mind 
 I am the soldier in the airport facing giants one more time 
 I am the woman shamed and haunted by the cry of unborn life 
 I'm every broken man, nervous child, lonely wife 
 Is there hope for every man 
 A solid place where we can stand 
 In this dry and weary land 
 Is there hope for every man 
 Is there love that never dies 
 Is there peace in troubled times 
 Someone help me understand 
 Is there hope for every man 
 Seems there's just so many roads to travel, it's hard to tell where they will lead 
 My life is scarred and my dreams unraveled 
 Now I'm scared to take the leap 
 If I could find someone to follow who knows my pain and feels the weight 
 The uncertainty of my tomorrow, the guilt and pain of yesterday 
 Is there hope for every man 
 A solid place where we can stand 
 In this dry and weary land 
 Is there hope for every man 
 Is there love that never dies 
 Is there peace in troubled times 
 Someone help me understand 
 Is there hope for every man 
 There is hope for every man 
 A solid place where we can stand 
 In this dry and weary land 
 There is hope for every man 
 There is Love that never dies 
 There is peace in troubled times 
 Will we help them understand? 
 Jesus is hope for every man 
 There is hope for every man 
 A solid place where we can stand 
 In this dry and weary land 
 There is hope for every man 
 There is Love that never dies 
 There is peace in troubled times 
 Will we help them understand? 
 Jesus is hope for every man

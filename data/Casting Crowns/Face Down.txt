I try to find a new way to tell You 
 Some way to show You what You mean to me 
 There's nothing new 
 I exhaust myself searching 
 The world just keeps turning 
 What else can I do 
 'Cause I find myself empty and 
 Face down 
 Having nothing else to cling to 
 But need of love that only You can give 
 Face down 
 Where I know that I belong 
 And I pray with grace that this world sees in me 
 Someone humbled and broken at Your feet 
 I stand amazed, see the work of Your hands 
 Still I don't understand why You would rescue me 
 An empty cross 
 Where You suffered and bled 
 Overcoming my death 
 Recreating me 
 With this freedom I will be 
 Face down 
 Having nothing else to cling to 
 But need of love that only You can give 
 Face down 
 Where I know that I belong 
 And I pray with grace that this world sees in me 
 Someone humbled and broken at Your feet 
 So I'm asking for Your help 
 Just can't do this by myself 
 After all, this life's for You and not for me 
 Through Your mercy now I see 
 Brokenness is what I need 
 So I'll stay right here at Your feet 
 Right here at Your feet and 
 Face down 
 Having nothing else to cling to 
 But need of love that only You can give 
 Face down 
 Where I know that I belong 
 And I pray with grace that this world sees in me 
 Someone humbled and broken at Your feet 
 Oh, humbled and broken at Your feet 
 At Your feet

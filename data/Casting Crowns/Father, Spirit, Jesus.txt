Lord, the worship we bring 
 Is more than songs that we sing 
 It's a reflection of our ever-changing lives 
 The best we have to offer 
 We don't just lift up our hands 
 Lord, we lift up our lives 
 For we know that You are worthy of our praise 
 To You our lifesongs raise 
 Rescued from darkness 
 We are walking in marvelous light 
 For we are children of the King! 
 Sing 
 You are worthy of all honor 
 Glory, praise, and power 
 King of the nations 
 You are holy God, almighty 
 Clothed in brilliant majesty 
 Father, Spirit, Jesus

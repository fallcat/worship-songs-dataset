At the end of myself 
 I'm empty and dry 
 I have nothing to give 
 But surrender inside 
 Let down your nets 
 This is not the end 
 From now on, you'll be 
 Fishers of men 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 At the end of myself 
 Judgment calls out my name 
 I've been looking for love 
 But I'm swallowed by shame 
 Throw away all your stones 
 Find forgiveness in Me 
 Let Me be your new passion 
 My daughter, you're free 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 At the end of myself 
 I've done things my own way 
 This world gave up on me 
 Now it's death I do pay 
 You know who I am 
 I'm sin's sacrifice 
 Today you will be 
 In paradise 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 Who is this man who calmed the seas? 
 And who is this man who loves the least of these? 
 I am the promised One 
 God gave His only Son 
 And those who believe 
 Will live eternally 
 At the end of yourself, just follow Me 
 When you lose everything, just follow Me 
 I will give you new life, just follow Me 
 Follow Me 
 If at the end of yourself, just follow Me 
 You may lose everything, just follow Me 
 I will give you new life, just follow Me 
 Follow Me

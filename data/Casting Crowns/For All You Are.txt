When I'm standing at the end of me 
 In the rubble of my broken dreams 
 And the wells I've dug aren't filling me 
 And the world I've made's not what it seems to be 
 My life, Your grace 
 Here I exchange 
 All of me for all You are 
 I lay at Your feet my broken heart 
 And I'll find my healing in Your scars 
 All of me for all You are 
 You're the anchor in a raging sea 
 In the center of the storm You are my peace 
 You're the dreamer of my destiny 
 And all You have begun You will complete 
 Your life, my gain 
 Here I exchange 
 All of me, I lay down for all You are 
 All of me, I lay down for all You are 
 Jesus, all of me, I lay down for all You are 
 All of me, I lay down for all You are 
 My life, Your grace 
 Here I exchange 
 Your life, my gain 
 Here I exchange 
 And I'll find my healing in Your scars 
 All of me for all You are

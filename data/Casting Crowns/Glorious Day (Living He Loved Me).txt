One day when Heaven is filled with His praises 
 One day when sin was as black as could be 
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin 
 Dwelt among men, my example is He 
 Word became flesh and the light shined among us 
 His glory revealed 
 Living, He loved me 
 Dying, He saved me 
 Buried, He carried my sins far away 
 Rising, He justified freely forever 
 One day He's coming 
 Oh glorious day, oh glorious day 
 One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain 
 One day they nailed Him to die on a tree 
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected 
 Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He 
 Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree 
 And took the nails for me 
 'Cause Living, He loved me 
 Dying, He saved me 
 Buried, He carried my sins far away 
 Rising, He justified freely forever 
 One day He's coming 
 Oh glorious day, oh glorious day 
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer 
 One day the stone rolled away from the door 
 Then He arose, over death He had conquered 
 Now He's ascended, my Lord evermore 
 Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him 
 From rising again 
 Rising again 
 Living, He loved me 
 Dying, He saved me 
 Buried, He carried my sins far away 
 Rising, He justified freely forever 
 One day He's coming 
 Oh glorious day, oh glorious day 
 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming (For Your coming) 
 One day the skies with His glories will shine (Glories will shine) 
 Wonderful day, my Beloved One, bringing 
 My Savior, Jesus, is mine 
 Living, He loved me 
 Dying, He saved me 
 Buried, He carried my sins far away 
 Rising, He justified freely forever 
 One day He's coming 
 Oh glorious day, oh glorious day 
 Oh, glorious day 
 Oh, glorious day

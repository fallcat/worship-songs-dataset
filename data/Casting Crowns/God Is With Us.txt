The skies don't seem to be as dark as usual 
 The stars seem brighter then they've been before 
 Deep within I feel my soul a stirring 
 As though my hope has been restored 
 The shepherds say they've heard the voice of angels 
 Confirming rumors spread across the land 
 That a child protected well from Herod's anger 
 Is our Father's Son, and the son of man 
 Love is raining down on the world tonight 
 There's a presence here I can tell 
 God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel 
 He's the Savior we have been praying for 
 In our humble hearts He will dwell 
 God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel 
 I feel compelled to tell all who will listen 
 That peace on earth is not so out of reach 
 If we can find grace, mercy and forgiveness 
 He has come to save, He is all of these 
 Love is raining down on the world tonight 
 There's a presence here I can tell 
 God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel 
 He's the Savior we have been praying for 
 In our humble hearts He will dwell 
 God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel 
 Love is raining down on the world tonight 
 There's a presence here I can tell 
 God is in us, God is for us, God is with us, Emmanuel 
 He's the Savior we have been praying for 
 In our humble hearts He will dwell 
 God is in us, God is for us, God is with us 
 You're the Savior we have been praying for 
 In our humble hearts You will dwell 
 You are in us, You are for us, You are with us, Emmanuel

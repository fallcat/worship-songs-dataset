I came to You with my heart in pieces 
 And found the God with healing in His hands 
 I turned to You, put everything behind me 
 And found the God who makes all things new 
 I looked to You, drowning in my questions 
 And found the God who holds all wisdom 
 And I trusted You and stepped out on the ocean 
 You caught my hand among the waves 
 'Cause You're the God of all my days 
 Each step I take 
 You make a way 
 And I will give You all my praise 
 My seasons change, You stay the same 
 You're the God of all my days 
 I ran from You, I wandered in the shadows 
 And found a God who relentlessly pursues 
 I hid from You, haunted by my failure 
 And found the God whose grace still covers me 
 I fell on You when I was at my weakest 
 And found the God, the lifter of my head 
 And I've worshiped You 
 And felt You right beside me 
 You're the reason that I sing 
 'Cause You're the God of all my days 
 Each step I take 
 You make a way 
 And I will give You all my praise 
 My seasons change, You stay the same 
 You're the God of all my days 
 In my worry, God You are my stillness 
 In my searching, God You are my answers 
 In my blindness, God You are my vision 
 In my bondage, God You are my freedom 
 In my weakness, God You are my power 
 You're the reason that I sing 
 'Cause You're the God of all my days 
 Each step I take 
 You make a way 
 And I will give You all my praise 
 My seasons change, You stay the same 
 You're the God of all my days 
 In my blindness, God You are my vision 
 In my bondage, God You are my freedom 
 All my days

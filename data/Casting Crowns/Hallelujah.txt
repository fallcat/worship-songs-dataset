Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 On the morning of creation 
 Father, Son and the Spirit rise 
 As they set the world in motion 
 The morning of the first sunrise 
 A symphony of golden sunlight 
 Dancing in the Father's eyes 
 He gazes at His masterpiece 
 As all creation cries 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Man shakes the fist at heaven 
 The breath of God still in his lungs 
 A brokenhearted Father grieves 
 In love He sends His only Son 
 He was bruised for our transgressions 
 Crushed and buried in the ground 
 As the sunrise finds an empty tomb 
 The redeemed of God resound 
 Holy quiet grips the night 
 The morning of the last sunrise 
 Broken slumber, blinding light 
 Nations tremble at the sight 
 The Son of Man just split the sky 
 Every saint and every scoffer 
 Every king and every pauper 
 At the name of Jesus all fall face down 
 From holy ground we'll rise 
 To meet the Bridegroom in the sky 
 From Earth to Heaven reigns the Son 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah

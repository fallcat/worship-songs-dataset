Father, hear my prayer 
 I need the perfect words 
 Words that he will hear 
 And know they're straight from You 
 I don't know what to say 
 I only know it hurts 
 To see my only friend slowly fade away 
 So maybe this time I'll speak the words of life 
 With Your fire in my eyes 
 But that old familiar fear is tearing at my words 
 What am I so afraid of? 
 'Cause here I go again 
 Talkin' 'bout the rain 
 And mulling over things that won't live past today 
 And as I dance around the truth 
 Time is not his friend 
 This might be my last chance to tell him that 
 You love him 
 But here I go again, here I go again 
 Lord, You love him so, You gave Your only Son 
 If he will just believe; he will never die 
 But how then will he know what he has never heard 
 Lord he has never seen mirrored in my life 
 So maybe this time I'll speak the words of life 
 With Your fire in my eyes 
 But that old familiar fear is tearing at my words 
 What am I so afraid of? 
 'Cause here I go again 
 Talkin' 'bout the rain 
 And mulling over things that won't live past today 
 And as I dance around the truth 
 Time is not his friend 
 This might be my last chance to tell him that 
 You love him 
 But here I go again, here I go, here I go 
 So maybe this time I'll speak the words of life 
 With Your fire in my eyes 
 But that old familiar fear is tearing at my words 
 What am I so afraid of? 
 'Cause here I go again 
 Talkin' 'bout the rain 
 And mulling over things that won't live past today 
 And as I dance around the truth 
 Time is not his friend 
 This might be my last chance to tell him that 
 You love him 
 This might be my last chance to tell him that You love him 
 This might be my last chance to tell him that You love him 
 You love him, You love him 
 What am I so afraid 
 What am I so afraid 
 What am I so afraid of? 
 How then will he know 
 What he has never heard

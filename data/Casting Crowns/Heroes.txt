She's on her own, two girls at home 
 Thirteen years just up and walked away 
 And left her all alone 
 With bills to pay and mouths to feed 
 And every day she's taking care of everybody else's needs 
 But she's finding her strength in the One love that wont ever leave her 
 So she works and she prays and she loves and she stays 'cause they need her 
 These are the heroes, just ordinary people 
 Laying down their lives like angels in disguise 
 They're weak but always willing 
 They dare to do the hard things 
 And in the dark and desperate places no one else goes 
 You'll find the heroes 
 You'll find the heroes 
 He walks the halls, against the flow 
 He sees his high school as his mission field 
 He's broken 'cause he knows 
 The hopeless road that they are taking 
 The empty feelings they are chasing only lead to futures wasted 
 So he's willing to stand alone 
 He lives what he believes when they all say it's not worth believing 
 Every night on his knees, he prays God, wont You please help me reach them? 
 These are the heroes, just ordinary people 
 Laying down their lives like angels in disguise 
 They're weak but always willing 
 They dare to do the hard things 
 And in the dark and desperate places no one else goes 
 You'll find the heroes 
 You'll find the heroes 
 You may never know their names 
 But they're moving mountains just the same 
 Instead of searching for the spotlight 
 They'll follow Jesus into the darkest night 
 Heroes, these are the heroes (These are the heroes) 
 These are the heroes, just ordinary people 
 Laying down their lives like angels in disguise 
 They're weak but always willing 
 They dare to do the hard things 
 And in the dark and desperate places no one else goes 
 You'll find the heroes (You'll find the heroes) 
 (In the board room with a Bible) 
 You'll find the heroes (You'll find the heroes) 
 (In the classroom praying for revival) 
 You'll find the heroes 
 (In third world countries, in downtown missions) 
 You'll find the heroes (You'll find the heroes)

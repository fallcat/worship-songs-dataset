God, You are my God 
 Earnestly I seek You, oh my soul 
 I thirst for You 
 My body aches in a dry and weary land 
 I've seen You in Your sanctuary 
 I beheld Your pow'r and shouted glory 
 My soul is full, my lips will sing Your praise 
 Lift your voices 
 Let the sound of praise be heard 
 All the ends of Earth 
 Praise the Holy One 
 Sing the glory of His name 
 Every tongue proclaim 
 Praise the Holy One 
 You are my help, I sing 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 My soul will cling 
 Your right hand holds me up 
 You are my king, You are my God 
 Lift your voices 
 Let the sound of praise be heard 
 All the ends of Earth 
 Praise the Holy One 
 Sing the glory of His name 
 Every tongue proclaim 
 Praise the Holy One 
 I will sing for Your glory 
 For Your love is better than life 
 I will sing for Your glory 
 For Your love is better than life 
 Better than life 
 Let the sound of praise be heard 
 All the ends of Earth 
 Praise the Holy One 
 Sing the glory of His name 
 Every tongue proclaim 
 Praise the Holy One

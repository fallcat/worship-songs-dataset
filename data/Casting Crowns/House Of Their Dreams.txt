A corner office was his dream 
 More like a prison now it seems 
 Somewhere on the corporate climb 
 He left his warrior behind 
 Now he's just a worker at a daily grind 
 Steals his years and numbs his mind 
 His strength is fading, his dreams are blind 
 This is not the life he had in mind 
 She lies awake 'cause he's up all night 
 Staring at a screen that tells him lies 
 That the grass is greener on the other side 
 So she's at the gym fighting off the years 
 To be young again and calm her fears 
 That she'll never be enough for him 
 Just as a young man catches her eye 
 Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars 
 With their cell phones and the closed doors 
 It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems 
 But they're all alone together 
 In the house of their dreams 
 Little sister, she's a sixteen-year-old princess 
 Lost somewhere between the swing set and 
 Her brand new crush's chariot awaits 
 And big brother's room's glowing with trophies that shout his name 
 But he'd trade all his high school fame 
 For some backyard catch with his hero again 
 But they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars 
 With their cell phones and the closed doors 
 It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems 
 But they're all alone together 
 In the house of their dreams 
 So now they're all dressed up in Sunday best 
 Sit up straight just like the rest 
 And they sing the songs of peace and rest that Jesus freely gives 
 And then their kids look up as daddy stands 
 And he takes his bride with trembling hands 
 Brother kneels at his fathers side as princess looks in the mothers eyes 
 Their tears tear down the walls as daddy prays 
 Were trapped in our own worlds and our own wars 
 With our cell phones and our closed doors 
 God, only You can save our family 
 And on this Rock, we'll build 
 On this Rock, we'll build 
 The house of our dreams

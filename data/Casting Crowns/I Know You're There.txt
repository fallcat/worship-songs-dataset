If all I had was one last breath 
 I'd spend it just to sing Your praise 
 Just to say Your name 
 If all I had was one last prayer 
 I'd pray it 'cause I know You're always listening 
 If I could live a thousand lives, bind the hands of time 
 I would spend every moment by Your side 
 'Cause I, I know You're there, I know You see me 
 You're the air I breathe 
 You are the ground beneath me 
 I know You're there, I know You hear me 
 I can find You anywhere 
 If all I had was one more song to sing 
 I would raise my voice to make the heavens ring 
 If all I had was one last chance, I'd take it 
 I would stake it all on You, yeah, yeah 
 If I could raise up high and catch a glimpse of every eye 
 I would make them believe 
 What I feel inside 
 'Cause I, I know You're there, I know You see me 
 You're the air I breathe 
 You are the ground beneath me 
 I know You're there, I know You hear me 
 I can find You anywhere 
 If I could live a thousand lives and bind the hands of time, oh, oh 
 If I could rise up high and catch a glimpse of every eye 
 I, I know You're there, I know You see me 
 You're the air I breathe 
 You are the ground beneath me 
 I know You're there, I know You hear me 
 I can find You anywhere 
 I know You're there 
 I know You're there 
 I know You're there, You're there

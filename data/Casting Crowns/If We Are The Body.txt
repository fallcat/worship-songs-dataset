It's crowded in worship today 
 As she slips in trying to fade into the faces 
 The girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than they know 
 Farther than they know 
 But if we are the body 
 Why aren't His arms reaching? 
 Why aren't His hands healing? 
 Why aren't His words teaching? 
 And if we are the body 
 Why aren't His feet going? 
 Why is His love not showing them there is a way? 
 There is a way 
 A traveler is far away from home 
 He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row 
 The weight of their judgmental glances 
 Tells him that his chances are better out on the road 
 But if we are the body 
 Why aren't His arms reaching? 
 Why aren't His hands healing? 
 Why aren't His words teaching? 
 And if we are the body 
 Why aren't His feet going? 
 Why is His love not showing them there is a way? 
 Jesus paid much too high a price 
 For us to pick and choose who should come 
 And we are the body of Christ 
 If we are the body 
 Why aren't His arms reaching? 
 Why aren't His hands healing? 
 Why aren't His words teaching? 
 And if we are the body 
 Why aren't His feet going? 
 Why is His love not showing them there is a way? 
 If we are the body 
 Why aren't His arms reaching? 
 Why aren't His hands healing? 
 Why aren't His words teaching? 
 And if we are the body 
 Why aren't His feet going? 
 Why is His love not showing them there is a way? 
 Jesus is the way

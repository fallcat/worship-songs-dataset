Here I cry, Lord, we pray 
 Our faces down, our hands are raised 
 You called us out, we turned away 
 We've turned away 
 With shipwrecked faith, the idols rise 
 We do what is right in our own eyes 
 Our children now will pay the price 
 We need Your light, Lord, shine Your light 
 If we've ever need You 
 Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now 
 We are desperate for Your hand 
 We're reaching out, we're reaching out 
 All our hearts, all our strength 
 With all our minds, we're at Your feet 
 May Your kingdom come in our hearts and lives 
 Let Your church arise, let Your church arise 
 If we've ever need You 
 Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now 
 We are desperate for Your hand 
 We're reaching out, we're reaching out 
 We're reaching out 
 If we've ever need You 
 Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now 
 We are desperate for Your hand 
 We're reaching out, we're reaching out 
 Lord, we're reaching out 
 If we've ever need You 
 Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now 
 Lord, we need You now 
 We are desperate for Your hand 
 We're reaching out 
 Lord, we're reaching out 
 We're reaching out 
 Lord, we're reaching out 
 We need You now 
 Revive us now 
 We need You now

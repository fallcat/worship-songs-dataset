If You ask me to leap 
 Out of my boat on the crashing waves 
 If You ask me to go 
 Preach to a lost world that Jesus saves 
 I'll go, but I cannot go alone 
 'Cause I know I'm nothing on my own 
 But the power of Christ in me makes me strong 
 Makes me strong 
 'Cause when I'm weak, You make me strong 
 When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me 
 'Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability 
 How refreshing to know You don't need me 
 How amazing to find that You want me 
 So I'll stand on Your truth, and I'll fight with Your strength 
 Until You bring the victory, by the power of Christ in me 
 If you ask me to run 
 And carry Your light into foreign land 
 If You ask me to fight 
 Deliver Your people from satan's hand 
 I'll go, but I cannot go alone 
 'Cause I know I'm nothing on my own 
 But the power of Christ in me makes me strong 
 Makes me strong 
 'Cause when I'm weak, You make me strong 
 When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me 
 'Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability 
 How refreshing to know You don't need me 
 How amazing to find that You want me 
 So I'll stand on Your truth, and I'll fight with Your strength 
 Until You bring the victory, by the power of Christ in me 
 To reach out with Your hands 
 To learn through Your eyes 
 To love with the love of a savior (the love of a savior) 
 To feel with Your heart 
 And to think with Your mind 
 I'd give my last breath for Your glory (I'd give my last breath for Your glory) 
 'Cause when I'm weak, You make me strong 
 When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me 
 'Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability 
 When I'm weak, You make me strong 
 When I'm blind, You shine Your light on me 
 'Cause I'll never get by living on my own ability 
 How refreshing to know You don't need me 
 How amazing to find that You want me 
 So I'll stand on Your truth, and I'll fight with Your strength 
 Until You bring the victory, by the power of Christ in me 
 The power of Christ in me 
 The power of Christ in me

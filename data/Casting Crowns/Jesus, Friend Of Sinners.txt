Jesus, friend of sinners 
 We have strayed so far away 
 We cut down people in Your name 
 But the sword was never ours to swing 
 Jesus, friend of sinners 
 The truth's become so hard to see 
 The world is on their way to You 
 But they're tripping over me 
 Always looking around but never looking up 
 I'm so double minded 
 A plank-eyed man with dirty hands 
 And a heart divided 
 Oh Jesus, friend of sinners 
 Open our eyes to the world 
 At the end our pointing fingers 
 Let our hearts be led by pardon 
 Help us reach with open hearts and open doors 
 Oh Jesus, friend of sinners 
 Break our hearts for what breaks Yours 
 Yeahâ€¦. 
 Jesus, friend of sinners 
 The One whose writing in the sand 
 Made the righteous turn away 
 And the stones fall from their hands 
 Help us to remember 
 We are all the least of these 
 Let the memory of Your pardon 
 Bring Your people to their knees 
 Nobody knows what we're for 
 Only what we're against 
 When we judge the wounded 
 What if we put down our signs 
 Crossed over the lines 
 And cared like You did 
 Oh Jesus, friend of sinners 
 Open our eyes to the world 
 At the end our pointing fingers 
 Let our hearts be led by mercy 
 Help us reach with open hearts and open doors 
 Oh Jesus, friend of sinners 
 Break our hearts for what breaks Yours 
 You care for the lost cause 
 You reach for the outcast 
 (For every outcast) 
 For the leper and the lame 
 They're the reason that You came 
 Most High, I was the lost cause 
 And I was the outcast 
 But You died for sinners just like me 
 A grateful leper at Your feet 
 'Cause You are good 
 You are good 
 And Your love endures forever 
 Jesus, friend of sinners 
 Open our eyes to the world 
 At the end our pointing fingers 
 Let our hearts be led by pardon 
 Help us reach with open hearts and open doors 
 Oh Jesus, friend of sinners 
 Break our hearts for what breaks Yours 
 And I was the lost cause 
 And I was the outcast, yeah 
 You died for sinners just like me 
 A grateful leper at Your feet

Living on my own, thinking of myself 
 Castles in the sand, temporary wealth 
 Now the walls are falling down 
 Now the storms are closing in 
 And here I am again 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I need to feel You in this place 
 To know You're by my side 
 And hear Your voice tonight 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I long for Your embrace 
 I'm beat and broken down 
 I can't find my way out 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 Curse this morning sun, drags me into one more day 
 Of reaping what I've sown, living with my shame 
 So welcome to my world, and the life that I have made 
 One day you're a prince, and the next day you're a slave 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I need to feel You in this place 
 To know You're by my side 
 And hear Your voice tonight 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I long for Your embrace 
 I'm beat and broken down 
 I can't find my way out 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 Lord, I just looked up today 
 And realized how far away I am from where You are 
 I don't know what else to pray 
 Broken at Your feet I lay 
 The life I've torn apart 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I need to feel You in this place 
 To know You're by my side 
 And hear Your voice tonight 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I long for Your embrace 
 I'm beat and broken down 
 I can't find my way out 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I  feel You in this place 
 I know You're by my side 
 I hear Your voice tonight 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 I long for Your embrace 
 I'm beat and broken down 
 You are my way out 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 Jesus, hold me now 
 Jesus, hold me now

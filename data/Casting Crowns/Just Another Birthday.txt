Sixteen finds me 
 Blowing out candles and making wishes 
 And all around me 
 Is everyone but the one I'm wishing for 
 And he sent me flowers 
 And gift-wrapped excuses 
 From a daddy whose daughter 
 Wants to see him again 
 And I know, I know 
 It's just another birthday 
 But I guess I thought 
 This would be the one 
 When he would call me, see me 
 Hold me and free me 
 But it's just another birthday 
 And I'll be fine 
 I'll be fine 
 Nineteen finds me 
 And I'm wild-eyed and wide open 
 I gave myself away to love 
 But backseat promises fade like a mist 
 I'm screaming at the midnight air 
 Everyone hears me but I don't care 
 My heart's clenched just like a fist 
 'Cause, people, I didn't ask for any of this 
 And I know, I know 
 It's just another birthday 
 But I guess I thought 
 This would be the one 
 When he would call me, see me 
 Hold me and free me 
 But it's just another birthday 
 And I'm not fine 
 I'm not fine 
 In the company of strangers 
 In a cold and sterile room 
 All alone with a child inside me 
 And I don't know what to do 
 Jesus, can You hear me 
 Come and heal my brokenness 
 Put the pieces back together 
 And be a Father to the fatherless 
 A Father to the fatherless 
 Twenty-one finds me 
 Blowing out candles and making wishes 
 And all around me 
 My barefoot princess twirls and sings 
 It's so amazing 
 Looking back at all God's brought us through 
 You are my happy birthday 
 And you were born to break the chains 
 Now I know, I know 
 It's not just another birthday 
 'Cause I'm here, she's here 
 And look how far we've come 
 Since you've called me, saw me 
 Held me and freed me 
 Thank you, Lord, for another birthday 
 And we'll be fine 
 We'll be fine

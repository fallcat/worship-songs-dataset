Hold it all together 
 Everybody needs you strong 
 But life hits you out of nowhere 
 And barely leaves you holding on 
 And when you're tired of fighting 
 Chained by your control 
 There's freedom in surrender 
 Lay it down and let it go 
 So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away 
 You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held 
 Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place 
 I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held 
 Just be held, just be held 
 If your eyes are on the storm 
 You'll wonder if I love you still 
 But if your eyes are on the cross 
 You'll know I always have and I always will 
 And not a tear is wasted 
 In time, you'll understand 
 I'm painting beauty with the ashes 
 Your life is in My hands 
 So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away 
 You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held 
 Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place 
 I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held 
 Just be held, just be held 
 Lift your hands, lift your eyes 
 In the storm is where you'll find Me 
 And where you are, I'll hold your heart 
 I'll hold your heart 
 Come to Me, find your rest 
 In the arms of the God who wont let go 
 So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away 
 You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held 
 Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place 
 I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held 
 (Stop holding on and just be held) Just be Held 
 Just be held 
 Just be held 
 Just be held

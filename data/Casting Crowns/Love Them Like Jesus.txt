The love of her life is drifting away 
 They're losing the fight for another day 
 The life that she's known is falling apart 
 A fatherless home, a child's broken heart 
 You're holding her hand, you're straining for words 
 You trying to make - sense of it all 
 She's desperate for hope, darkness clouding her view 
 She's looking to you 
 Just love her like Jesus, carry her to Him 
 His yoke is easy, His burden is light 
 You don't need the answers to all of life's questions 
 Just know that He loves her and stay by her side 
 Love her like Jesus 
 Love her like Jesus 
 The gifts lie in wait, in a room painted blue 
 Little blessing from Heaven would be there soon 
 Hope fades in the night, blue skies turn to gray 
 As the little one slips away 
 You're holding their hand, you're straining for words 
 You trying to make sense of it all 
 They're desperate for hope, darkness clouding their view 
 They're looking to you 
 Just love them like Jesus, carry them to Him 
 His yoke is easy, His burden is light 
 You don't need the answers to all of life's questions 
 Just know that He loves them and stay by their side 
 Love them like Jesus 
 Lord of all creation holds our lives in His hands 
 The God of all the nations holds our lives in HIs hands 
 The Rock of our salvation holds our lives in HIs hands 
 He cares for them just as He cares for you 
 So love them like Jesus, love them like Jesus 
 You don't need the answers to all of life's questions 
 Just know that He loves them and stay by their side 
 Love them like Jesus 
 Love them like Jesus 
 Love them like Jesus 
 Love them like Jesus

For the longest time, I believed the lie 
 That I'm not a strong enough believer 
 To be the friend that can take your hand 
 And lead you straight to Jesus 
 I'm waiting on the preachers, singers, and the teachers 
 To string the perfect words together 
 But every single time I have to say goodbye 
 I wonder will this be the last time? 
 I can't call myself your friend and walk away 
 When we love, we earn the right to speak the truth 
 When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love 
 I'm not pointing my finger, I'm holding out my hand 
 I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend 
 Let my life and my words be the proof 
 I'm gonna love you with the truth 
 Gonna love you with the truth 
 Yes, God is love, but God is just 
 And we are separated in our darkness 
 So God let Him who knew no sin 
 To become sin to make us right with Him 
 It's not about religion or earning Gods forgiveness 
 Or magic prayers or new behavior 
 It's all about your heart, He'll meet you where you are 
 Turn from your sin and trust in Christ as Lord 
 Jesus is the truth, the life, the way 
 When we love, we earn the right to speak the truth 
 When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love 
 I'm not pointing my finger, I'm holding out my hand 
 I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend 
 Let my life and my words be the proof 
 I'm gonna love you with the truth 
 Gonna love you with the truth 
 How I've prayed for this moment, that you would finally see 
 That God is more than religion, a stained-glass fantasy 
 And how I've prayed for the courage, for my silent faith to speak 
 Or that God would just send you a better friend than me 
 When we love, we earn the right to speak the truth 
 When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love 
 I'm not pointing my finger, I'm holding out my hand 
 I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend 
 Let my life and my words be the proof 
 I'm gonna love you with the truth 
 Gonna love you with the truth

I was a wandering soul 
 Traveling a well worn road 
 A sinner so far from home 
 No second chance in sight 
 I heard You call my name 
 I felt You lift my shame 
 And I made a vow that day 
 That I'd spend the rest of my life 
 Loving my Jesus 
 Showing my scars 
 Telling my story of how mercy 
 Can reach You where You are 
 And I pray the whole world hears 
 The cry of my heart 
 Is to see all the ones I love 
 Loving my Jesus 
 Sin tries to make you hide 
 Whispers that same old lie 
 Keep all your pain inside 
 'Cause no one will understand 
 The last thing this lost world needs 
 Is someone I'm trying to be 
 Truth that has set me free 
 Is that I'm just a broken man 
 When all is said and done 
 When my last song's been sung 
 I stand face to face with the One 
 Who gave all for me 
 May all I have to show 
 Be all that mattered most 
 Making Your great name known 
 Let this be my only legacy

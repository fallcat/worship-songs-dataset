In the morning when I rise 
 Jesus be my eyes 
 Before the day rushes in 
 With You is where I begin 
 As You sing over me with Your love 
 I will sing praise for all You have done 
 Fill my heart as I hunger for You 
 Flood my mind with Your wisdom, Your mercy, Your truth 
 Father, make me a river 
 Come living water 
 Flow through me 
 You are the One that I thirst for 
 So come living water 
 Flow through me 
 Guide every step I take 
 Lord, let me not wander away 
 Father, fill every word I speak 
 With the same grace that You've given me 
 Touch the world with my hands, they are Yours 
 Let my love show the lost that You are the Lord 
 Father, make me a river 
 Come living water 
 Flow through me 
 You are the One that I thirst for 
 So come living water 
 Flow through me 
 Make me a river 
 Make me a river 
 Let the river flow 
 Father, make me a river 
 Come living water 
 Flow through me 
 You are the One that I thirst for 
 So come living water 
 Flow through me 
 Let the river flow (Father, make me a river) 
 Let the river flow (Living water, flow through me) 
 Let the river flow (Father, make me a river) 
 Let the river flow (Living water, flow through me) 
 Father, make me a river 
 Come living water 
 Flow through me

Here I am a sinner 
 Broken and in need of You 
 Take my life and wash my fears away 
 For You are the Great I AM 
 Rest assured, I feel Your hand 
 Holding me until the darkness clears 
 A Father to the fatherless 
 Redeemer of my soul 
 My life is Yours forever 
 My heart will always know 
 Your mercy saved me 
 Mercy made me whole 
 Your mercy found me 
 Called me as Your own 
 Here I stand a child of Yours 
 Broken and in need of You 
 Break these chains and wash my guilt away 
 Healer of my brokenness 
 My weary soul will find its rest 
 You are my strength, the lifter of my head 
 You're greater than my yesterdays 
 You hold me close today 
 You're the Lord of my tomorrows 
 My heart will always say 
 You're greater than my yesterdays 
 You hold me close today 
 You're the Lord of my tomorrows 
 My heart will always say 
 Your mercy saved me 
 Mercy made me whole 
 Your mercy found me 
 Called me as Your own 
 Your mercy saved me 
 Mercy made me whole 
 Made me whole 
 Your mercy found me 
 Called me as Your own 
 You called me as Your own 
 You called me as Your own 
 You called me as Your own 
 You called me as Your own 
 You called me as Your own 
 You called me as your own 
 Thank You for Your mercy 
 Thank You for Your mercy 
 Thank You for Your mercy 
 Thank You for Your mercy 
 Your mercy saved me 
 Mercy made me whole 
 Your mercy found me 
 Called me as Your own 
 Your mercy saved me 
 Mercy made me whole 
 Your mercy found me 
 Called me as Your own 
 You called me as Your own 
 Your own

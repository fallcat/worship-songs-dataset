God, help me get away 
 Break the chains and set me free 
 From the other side of me 
 I am my own worst enemy 
 I caught a glimpse in my rearview mirror 
 Of an old familiar face 
 Blurry image coming in clearer 
 Of a past I can't erase 
 I could've sworn I put him in the ground 
 But looks like he's found his way out 
 God, help me get away 
 Break the chains and set me free 
 From the other side of me 
 I can't fight this fight alone 
 I'll never make it on my own 
 Lord Jesus, rescue me 
 From my own worst enemy 
 I'll take a step and it's right behind me 
 Always fighting for control 
 There's a war that's raging inside me 
 I feel the battle for my soul 
 It's like my shadow is dragging me around 
 And You are my only way out 
 God, help me get away 
 Break the chains and set me free 
 From the other side of me (from the other side of me) 
 I can't fight this fight alone 
 I'll never make it on my own 
 Lord Jesus, rescue me 
 From my own worst enemy 
 Lord, help me feed the life I'm trying to live 
 And starve the life I'm trying to leave 
 Help me believe the old is dead and gone 
 And I am a new creation 
 God, help me get away 
 Break the chains and set me free 
 From the other side of me (from the other side of me) 
 I can't fight this fight alone 
 I'll never make it on my own 
 Lord Jesus, rescue me 
 From my own worst enemy 
 God, help me get away 
 Break the chains and set me free 
 From the other side of me (from the other side of me) 
 I can't fight this fight alone 
 I'll never make it on my own 
 Lord Jesus, rescue me 
 From my own worst enemy

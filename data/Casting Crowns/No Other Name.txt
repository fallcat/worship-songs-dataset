One name holds weight above them all 
 His fame outlasts the earth He formed 
 His praise resounds beyond the stars 
 And echoes in our hearts 
 The greatest One of all 
 His face shines brighter than the sun 
 His grace as boundless as His love 
 He reigns with healing in His wings 
 The King above all kings 
 The greatest One of all 
 Lift up our eyes, see the King has come 
 Light of the world reaching out for us 
 There is no other name 
 There is no other name 
 Jesus Christ, our God 
 Seated on high, the undefeated One 
 Mountains bow down as we lift Him up 
 There is no other name 
 There is no other name 
 Jesus Christ, our God 
 Find hope when all the world seems lost 
 Behold the triumph of the cross 
 His power has trampled death and grave 
 Our life found in His name 
 The greatest name of all 
 The earth will shake and tremble before Him 
 Chains will break as Heaven and Earth sing 
 Holy is the name 
 Holy is the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 There is no other name 
 There is no other name 
 Jesus

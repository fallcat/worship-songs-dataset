O come, all ye faithful 
 Joyful and triumphant 
 O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; 
 Come and behold Him, 
 Born the King of angels; 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ, the Lord! 
 Sing, choirs of angels, 
 Sing in exultation, 
 Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above! 
 Glory to God, 
 Glory in the highest; 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ, the Lord! 
 Yea, Lord, we greet thee, 
 Born this happy morning, 
 Jesus, to Thee be all glory given; 
 Word of the Father, 
 Now in flesh appearing; 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Oh come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ, the Lord! 
 Come let us adore Him 
 Come let us adore Him 
 He is Christ the Lord 
 Sing choirs of angels 
 Come let us adore Him 
 Come let us adore 
 Come let us adore Him

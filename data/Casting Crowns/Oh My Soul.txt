Oh, my soul 
 Oh, how you worry 
 Oh, how you're weary, from fearing you lost control 
 This was the one thing, you didn't see coming 
 And no one would blame you, though 
 If you cried in private 
 If you tried to hide it away, so no one knows 
 No one will see, if you stop believing 
 Oh, my soul 
 You are not alone 
 There's a place where fear has to face the God you know 
 One more day, He will make a way 
 Let Him show you how, you can lay this down 
 'Cause you're not alone 
 Here and now 
 You can be honest 
 I won't try to promise that someday it all works out 
 'Cause this is the valley 
 And even now, He is breathing on your dry bones 
 And there will be dancing 
 There will be beauty where beauty was ash and stone 
 This much I know 
 I'm not strong enough, I can't take anymore 
 (You can lay it down, you can lay it down) 
 And my shipwrecked faith will never get me to shore 
 (You can lay it down, you can lay it down) 
 Can He find me here 
 Can He keep me from going under 
 Oh, my soul 
 You're not alone

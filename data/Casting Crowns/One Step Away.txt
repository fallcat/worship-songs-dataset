What if you could go back and relive one day of your life all over again 
 And unmake the mistake that left you a million miles away 
 From the you, you once knew 
 Now yesterday's shame keeps saying that you'll never get back on track 
 But what if I told you... 
 You're one step away from surrender 
 One step away from coming home, coming home 
 One step from arms wide open 
 His love has never let you go 
 You're not alone 
 You're one step away 
 It doesn't matter how far you've gone 
 Mercy says you don't have to keep running down the road you're on 
 Love's never met a lost cause 
 Your shame, lay it down 
 Leave your ghosts in the past 'cause you know that you can't go back 
 But you can turn around 
 You've never been more than... 
 One step away from surrender 
 One step away from coming home, coming home 
 One step from arms wide open 
 His love has never let you go 
 You're not alone (not alone) 
 You're one step away 
 One step away 
 Lay down, lay down your old chains 
 Come now, and take up your new name 
 Your best life up ahead now 
 You're one step away 
 So come on home, come on home 
 One step from arms wide open 
 His love has never let you go 
 You're not alone (you're not alone) 
 You're one step away 
 Lay down, lay down your old chains 
 Take up, take up your new name 
 Lay down, lay down your old chains 
 Come now, take up your new name 
 Your best life up ahead now 
 One step away 
 Lay down, lay down your old chains 
 Come now, and take up your new name 
 Your best life up ahead now 
 You're just one step away

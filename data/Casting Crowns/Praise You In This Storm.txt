I was sure by now 
 That You would have reached down 
 And wiped our tears away 
 Stepped in and saved the day 
 But once again, I say "Amen", and it's still raining 
 As the thunder rolls 
 I barely hear You whisper through the rain 
 "I'm with you" 
 And as Your mercy falls 
 I raise my hands and praise the God who gives 
 And takes away 
 And I'll praise You in this storm 
 And I will lift my hands 
 For You are who You are 
 No matter where I am 
 And every tear I've cried 
 You hold in Your hand 
 You never left my side 
 And though my heart is torn 
 I will praise You in this storm 
 I remember when 
 I stumbled in the wind 
 You heard my cry 
 You raised me up again 
 My strength is almost gone 
 How can I carry on 
 If I can't find You 
 As the thunder rolls 
 I barely hear You whisper through the rain 
 "I'm with you" 
 And as Your mercy falls 
 I raise my hands and praise the God who gives 
 And takes away 
 And I'll praise You in this storm 
 And I will lift my hands 
 For You are who You are 
 No matter where I am 
 And every tear I've cried 
 You hold in Your hand 
 You never left my side 
 And though my heart is torn 
 I will praise You in this storm 
 I lift my eyes unto the hills 
 Where does my help come from? 
 My help comes from the Lord 
 The Maker of Heaven and Earth 
 I lift my eyes unto the hills 
 Where does my help come from? 
 My help comes from the Lord 
 The Maker of Heaven and Earth 
 And I'll praise You in this storm 
 And I will lift my hands 
 For You are who You are 
 No matter where I am 
 Every tear I've cried 
 You hold in Your hand 
 You never left my side 
 And though my heart is torn 
 I will praise You in this storm 
 And though my heart is torn 
 I will praise You in this storm

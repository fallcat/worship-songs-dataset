I will sing to the Lord 
 And I will lift my voice 
 For You have heard my cry 
 I will sing to the Lord 
 And I will lift my hands 
 For You have brought me out of the pit 
 For You have brought me out of the pit 
 And I'll sing glory, hallelujah 
 I lift You name on high 
 I'll sing holy, 'cause You're worthy 
 I'll praise You with the dance 
 And I'll sing glory, hallelujah 
 I lift You name on high 
 I'll sing holy, 'cause You're worthy 
 I'll praise You with the dance 
 I will praise You with the dance 
 I will praise You with the dance 
 I will sing to the Lord 
 And I will lift my voice 
 For You have heard my cry 
 I will sing to the Lord 
 And I will lift my hands 
 For You have brought me out of the pit 
 For You have brought me out of the pit 
 And I'll sing glory, hallelujah 
 I lift You name on high 
 I'll sing holy, 'cause You're worthy 
 I'll praise You with the dance 
 And I'll sing glory, hallelujah 
 I lift You name on high 
 I'll sing holy, 'cause You're worthy 
 I'll praise You with the dance 
 And I'll sing glory, hallelujah 
 I lift You name on high 
 I'll sing holy, 'cause You're worthy 
 I'll praise You with the dance 
 And I'll sing glory, hallelujah 
 I lift You name on high 
 I'll sing holy, 'cause You're worthy 
 I'll praise You with the dance 
 I will praise You with the dance 
 I will praise You with the dance

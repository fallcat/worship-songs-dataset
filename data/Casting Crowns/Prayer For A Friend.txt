Lord, I lift my friend to You, I've done all that I know to do 
 I lift my friend to You 
 Complicated circumstances have clouded his view 
 Lord, I lift my friend up to You 
 I fear that I won't have the words that he needs to hear 
 I pray for Your wisdom, oh God, and a heart that's sincere 
 Lord, I lift my friend up to You 
 Lord, I lift my friend to You 
 My best friend in the world, I know he means much more to You 
 I want so much to help him, but this is something he has to do 
 And Lord, I lift my friend up to You 
 'Cause there's a way that seems so right to him 
 But You know where that leads 
 He's becoming a puppet of the world, too blind to see the strings 
 Lord, I lift my friend up to You 
 My friend up to You 
 Lord, I lift my friend to You, I've done all that I know to do 
 I lift my friend to You

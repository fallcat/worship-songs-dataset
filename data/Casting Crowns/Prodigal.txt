Living on my own, thinking for myself 
 Castles in the sand, temporary wealth 
 The walls are falling down, the storms are closing in 
 Tears have filled my eyes, here I am again 
 And I've held out as long as I can 
 Now I'm letting go and holding out my hand 
 Daddy, here I am again, will You take me back tonight 
 I went and made the world my friend, and it left me high and dry 
 I drag Your name back through the mud 
 That You first found me in 
 Not worthy to be called Your son 
 Is this to be my end 
 Daddy, here I am 
 Here I am again 
 Curse this morning sun, drags me in to one more day 
 Of reaping what I've sown, of living with my shame 
 Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made 
 Where one day you're a prince, the next day you're a slave 
 And I've held out as long as I can 
 Now I'm letting go and holding out my hand 
 Daddy, here I am again, will You take me back tonight 
 I went and made the world my friend, and it left me high and dry 
 I drag Your name back through the mud 
 That You first found me in 
 Not worthy to be called Your son 
 Is this to be my end 
 Daddy, here I am 
 Here I am again 
 And I've held out as long as I can 
 Now I'm letting go and holding out my hand 
 Daddy, here I am again, will You take me back tonight 
 I went and made the world my friend, and it left me high and dry 
 I drag Your name back through the mud 
 That You first found me in 
 Not worthy to be called Your son 
 Is this to be my end 
 Daddy, here I am 
 Here I am again

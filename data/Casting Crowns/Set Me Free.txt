It hasn't always been this way 
 I remember brighter days 
 Before the dark ones came 
 Stole my mind 
 Wrapped my soul in chains 
 Now I live among the dead 
 Fighting voices in my head 
 Hoping someone hears me crying in the night 
 And carries me away 
 Set me free of the chains holding me 
 Is anybody out there hearing me? 
 Set me free 
 Morning breaks another day 
 Finds me crying in the rain 
 All alone with my demons I am 
 Who is this man that comes my way? 
 The dark ones shriek 
 They scream His name 
 Is this the One they say will set the captives free? 
 Jesus, rescue me 
 Set me free of the chains holding me 
 Is anybody out there hearing me? 
 Set me free 
 And as the God man passes by 
 He looks straight through my eyes 
 And darkness cannot hide 
 Do you want to be free? 
 Lift your chains 
 I hold the key 
 All power on Heav'n and Earth belong to me 
 Do you want to be free? 
 Lift your chains 
 I hold the key 
 All power on Heav'n and Earth belong to me 
 You are free 
 You are free 
 You are free

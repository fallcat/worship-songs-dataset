O God, You are my God 
 And earnestly I seek You 
 O how I long for You 
 In this dry and weary land 
 I've seen You in the sanctuary 
 And I beheld Your glory 
 So I can think of only one thing I can do 
 I lift my hands 
 I lift my hands and I will praise You all my days 
 I lift my voice 
 I lift my voice to You in this simple song of praise 
 I lift my eyes 
 For I will think of You through the watches of the night 
 Hear the voices ring as Your children sing 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 O God, You are my God 
 And earnestly I seek You 
 O how I long for You 
 In this dry and weary land 
 I've seen You in the sanctuary 
 And I beheld Your glory 
 So I can think of only one thing I can do 
 I lift my hands 
 I lift my hands and I will praise You all my days 
 I lift my voice 
 I lift my voice to You in this simple song of praise 
 I lift my eyes 
 For I will think of You through the watches of the night 
 Hear the voices ring as Your children sing 
 I lift my hands and I will praise You all my days 
 I lift my voice to You in this simple song of praise 
 For I will think of You through the watches of the night 
 Hear the voices ring as Your children sing 
 Hear the voices ring as the children sing 
 Hear the voices ring as the children sing 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 In the shadow of Your wings

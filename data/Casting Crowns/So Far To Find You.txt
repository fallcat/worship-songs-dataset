You were broken, abandoned 
 And crying all alone 
 We were waiting and praying 
 And longing to bring you home 
 And then we saw your face 
 In a moment you were wrapped up in our hearts 
 We took a step of faith 
 And now here we are 
 Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight 
 I have come so far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 Will you take my love and give up the fight 
 I have come so far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 From a world away, I journeyed 
 Just to hold your hand 
 You will never be alone again 
 I've come so far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 You were fighting and fearful 
 You were hiding your heart away 
 But I was trying so hard to show you 
 'Cause there were no words that I could say 
 If you could see my heart 
 You would know that all I want to do 
 Is care for you 
 Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight 
 I have come so far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 Will you take my love and give up the fight 
 I have come so far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 Here in your eyes I see 
 Reflections of myself 
 How I'm the child that's really running 
 But I can hear a voice that's whispering my name 
 Saying come to me, don't run from me 
 I'm all you need and I am calling 
 Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight 
 I have come so far 
 Will you take my love and give up the fight 
 I have come so far 
 Will you let me hold you in my arms tonight 
 I have come so far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 Will you take my love and give up the fight 
 I have come so far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 From Heaven's throne 
 Down to a rugged cross I came 
 It was My love for you that brought Me all the way 
 So far to find you 
 So far to find you 
 You were broken, abandoned 
 And crying all alone

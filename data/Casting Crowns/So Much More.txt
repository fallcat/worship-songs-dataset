I will love You Lord always 
 Not just for the things You've done for me 
 And I will praise You all my days 
 Not just for the change You've made in me 
 But I'll praise You for You are holy, Lord 
 And I'll lift my hands, but You are worthy of so much more 
 For You are awesome, God of the Nations, Lion of Judah, 
 Rock of the Ages, Alpha, Omega 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 More than these hands I'll raise 
 I'll live a life of praise 
 I'll live a life of praise 
 I will serve You Lord, always for You are my strength 
 When I am weak 
 I will never be afraid for You are my rock and You protect me 
 But I'll praise You for You are holy, Lord 
 And I'll lift my hands, but You are worthy of so much more 
 For You are awesome, God of the Nations, Lion of Judah, 
 Rock of the Ages, Alpha, Omega 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 More than these hands 
 For You are awesome, God of the Nations, Lion of Judah, 
 Rock of the Ages, Alpha, Omega 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 More than these hands I'll raise 
 You're worthy of my praise 
 More than these hands I'll raise 
 For You are awesome, God of the Nations, Lion of Judah, 
 Rock of the Ages, Alpha, Omega 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 More than these hands I'll raise 
 You're worthy of my praise 
 For You are awesome, God of the Nations, Lion of Judah, 
 Rock of the Ages

I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 You saved my weary soul from all my sin and pain and suffering 
 A song of the redeemed 
 I once was lost but You found me 
 Oh, I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 You stepped out of Your throne all wrapped in flesh 
 You made Yourself like me 
 A song of righteousness I couldn't reach till You reached me 
 Oh, I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 Oh, glory hallelujah to the Lamb that was slain 
 I cannot hold it in 
 You've given me a brand new name 
 A song of my deliverance 
 You've broken all my chains and I am free 
 Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing 
 I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 I was sentenced to a life in chains 
 No hope for being free 
 You opened up the door and said, "Come on and follow Me" 
 Now I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 It goes, "Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost but now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see" 
 Now I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 Oh, I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 Now I have a song that the angels can't sing 
 Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing 
 Oh, I have a song the angels can't sing

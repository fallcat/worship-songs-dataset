Ezekiel stared down into the valley 
 Filled with dry bones baking in the sun 
 Remains that used to be a mighty army 
 To him, it looked like their fighting days were done 
 But driven by a calling on his life 
 He spoke God's words, the bones began to shake 
 He stared wide-eyed as the flesh began to form 
 And as he prophesied to the wind 
 The solders began to wake 
 And the Lord sent His wind into the valley 
 And breathed the breath of life into their souls 
 And raised them again a mighty army 
 For soon these arisen warriors will battle again 
 For they have been filled with the Spirit Wind 
 Woah…. 
 A pastor stands before his congregation 
 Once a mighty army for the Lord 
 But now he stares into the lifeless eyes 
 Believers leading carnal lives 
 He wanders what they're fighting for 
 But driven by a calling on his life 
 He spoke God's word like he'd done a hundred times before 
 But this time he comes broken and weeping 
 With tears of a broken heart 
 And he cries out to the Lord 
 Oh Lord, send Your wind into the valley 
 And breathe the breath of life into their souls 
 And raise them again a mighty army 
 For soon these arisen warriors will battle again 
 For they have been filled with the Spirit Wind 
 Woah… 
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me 
 Breathe Your life in me 
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me 
 Breathe Your life in me 
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me 
 Breathe Your life in me 
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me 
 Breathe Your life in me 
 Holy Spirit, breathe Your life in me 
 Oh Lord, send Your wind into this valley 
 Breathe the breath of life into our souls 
 Raise us again a mighty army 
 Soon these arisen warriors will battle again 
 We have been filled with the Spirit Wind 
 Woah… 
 Holy Spirit 
 Breathe Your life, breathe Your life 
 Oh Lord, we need You now 
 Breathe Your life into us 
 Lord, we need You now 
 Breathe Your life 
 Our churches and our families 
 Oh Lord, we need You now 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe life into this dry and weary land 
 Breathe Your life 
 Raise us up again

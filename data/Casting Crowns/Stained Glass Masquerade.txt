Is there anyone that fails 
 Is there anyone that falls 
 Am I the only one in church today feelin' so small 
 'Cause when I take a look around 
 Everybody seems so strong 
 I know they'll soon discover 
 That I don't belong 
 So I tuck it all away, like everything's okay 
 If I make them all believe it, maybe I'll believe it too 
 So with a painted grin, I play the part again 
 So everyone will see me the way that I see them 
 Are we happy plastic people 
 Under shiny plastic steeples 
 With walls around our weakness 
 And smiles to hide our pain 
 But if the invitation's open 
 To every heart that has been broken 
 Maybe then we close the curtain on our stained glass masquerade 
 Is there anyone who's been there 
 Are there any hands to raise 
 Am I the only one who's traded 
 In the altar for a stage 
 The performance is convincing 
 And we know every line by heart 
 Only when no one is watching 
 Can we really fall apart 
 But would it set me free 
 If I dared to let you see 
 The truth behind the person 
 That you imagine me to be 
 Would your arms be open 
 Or would you walk away 
 Would the love of Jesus 
 Be enough to make you stay 
 Are we happy plastic people 
 Under shiny plastic steeples 
 With walls around our weakness 
 And smiles to hide our pain 
 But if the invitation's open 
 To every heart that has been broken 
 Maybe then we close the curtain on our stained glass masquerade 
 Are we happy plastic people 
 Under shiny plastic steeples 
 With walls around our weakness 
 And smiles to hide our pain 
 But if the invitation's open 
 To every heart that has been broken 
 Maybe then we close the curtain on our stained glass masquerade 
 But if the invitation's open 
 To every heart that has been broken 
 Maybe then we close the curtain on our stained glass masquerade 
 Is there anyone that fails 
 Is there anyone that falls 
 Am I the only one in church today feelin' so small

Sweet little Jesus boy, born in a manger 
 Sweet little Holy child, we didn't know who You were 
 Long time ago it seems You were born 
 Born in a manger Lord, sweet little Jesus boy 
 Didn't know You'd come to save us all 
 To take our sins away 
 Our eyes were blind we did not see 
 We didn't know who You were 
 You have shown us how 
 And we are trying 
 Master You have shown us how 
 Even as You were dying 
 This world treats You mean Lord 
 Treats me mean too 
 But that's how things are done down here 
 We didn't know it was You 
 Didn't know You'd come to save us all 
 To take our sins away 
 Our eyes were blind we did not see 
 We didn't know who You were

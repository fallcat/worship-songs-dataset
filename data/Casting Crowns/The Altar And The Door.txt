Careless, I am reckless 
 I'm a wrong-way-travelin'-slowly-unraveling shell of a man 
 Burn out, I'm so numb now 
 That the fire's just an ember way down in the corner, of my cold, cold heart 
 Lord, this time I'll make it right,here at the altar I lay my life 
 Your kingdom come but my will was done, my heart is broken as I... 
 Cry, like so many times before 
 But my eyes are dry before I leave the floor, oh Lord (I'll try) 
 I try but this time, Jesus, how can I be sure I will not lose my follow through 
 Between the altar and the door 
 Here at the altar, oh my world so black and white 
 How could I ever falter 
 What You've shown me to be right 
 Lord, this time I'll make it right,here at the altar I lay my life 
 Your kingdom come but my will was done, my heart is broken as I... 
 Cry, like so many times before 
 But my eyes are dry before I leave the floor, oh Lord (I'll try) 
 I try but this time, Jesus, how can I be sure I will not lose my follow through 
 Between the altar and the door 
 I'm trying so hard to stop trying so hard 
 Just let You be who You are 
 Lord, who You are in me 
 Jesus, I'm trying so hard to stop trying so hard 
 Just let You be who You are 
 Lord, who You are in me 
 Oh Lord, I 
 Cry, like so many times before 
 But my eyes are dry before I leave the floor, oh Lord (I'll try) 
 I try but this time, Jesus, how can I be sure I will not lose my follow through 
 Between the altar and the door 
 Cry, like so many times before 
 But my eyes are dry before I leave the floor, oh Lord (I'll try) 
 I try but this time, Jesus, how can I be sure I will not lose my follow through 
 Between the altar and the door 
 Try...(trying so hard) 
 Like so many times before... (try so hard) 
 But my eyes are dry before I leave the floor

I spend all my time 
 Dreaming what the future's gonna bring 
 When all of this time 
 There's a world passing by 
 Right in front of me 
 Set my sights on tomorrow 
 While I'm tripping over today 
 Who says big things 
 Are somewhere off in the distance 
 I don't want to look back 
 Just to see all the times that I missed it 
 I want to be here and now 
 Starting right here, right now 
 With the very next words of love to be spoken 
 To the very next heart that's shattered and broken 
 To the very next way you're gonna use me 
 Show me the next thing 
 I'll do the next thing 
 Let my very next breath 
 Breathe out a song of praise to you 
 With my very next step 
 Be on a road that was planned by you 
 Lord, wherever you're leading me 
 That's where I want to be 
 With the very next words of love to be spoken 
 To the very next heart that's shattered and broken 
 To the very next way you're gonna use me 
 Show me the next thing 
 I'll do the next thing 
 Eyes wide open I see you working 
 All around me you're on the move 
 Step by step I'm running to meet you 
 In the next thing, in the next thing 
 Eyes wide open I see you working 
 All around me you're on the move 
 Step by step I'm running to meet you 
 In the next thing 
 With the very next words of love to be spoken 
 To the very next heart that's shattered and broken 
 To the very next way you're gonna use me 
 Show me the next thing 
 Eyes wide open I see you working 
 All around me you're on the move (I'll do the next thing) 
 Step by step I'm running to meet you 
 In the next thing, in the next thing 
 Eyes wide open I see you working 
 All around me you're on the move (I'll do the next thing) 
 Step by step I'm running to meet you 
 In the next thing, in the next thing 
 Eyes wide open I see you working 
 All around me you're on the move 
 Step by step I'm running to meet you 
 In the next thing, in the next thing

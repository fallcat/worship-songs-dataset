Leave it all behind 
 Leave it all behind 
 Leave it all behind 
 Leave it all behind 
 I have what you need, but you keep on searching 
 I've done all the work, but you keep on working 
 When you're running on empty 
 And you can't find the remedy 
 Just come to the well 
 You can spend your whole life 
 Chasing what's missing 
 But that empty inside, it just ain't gonna listen 
 When nothing can satisfy 
 And the world leaves you high and dry 
 Just come to the well 
 And all who thirst will thirst no more 
 And all who search will find 
 What their souls long for 
 The world will try but it can never fill 
 So leave it all behind 
 And come to the well 
 So bring me your heart, no matter how broken 
 Just come as you are, when your last prayer is spoken 
 Just rest in my arms a while 
 You'll feel the change, my child 
 When you come to the well 
 And all who thirst will thirst no more 
 And all who search will find 
 What their souls long for 
 The world will try but it can never fill 
 So leave it all behind 
 And come to the well, yeah 
 Leave it all behind 
 The world will try but it can never fill 
 Leave it all behind 
 And now that you're full of love beyond measure 
 Your joy's gonna flow like a stream in the desert 
 Soon all the world will see 
 Living water is found in me 
 'Cause you've come to the well, yeah 
 And all who thirst will thirst no more 
 And all who search will find 
 What their souls long for 
 The world will try but it can never fill 
 So leave it all behind 
 And come to the well 
 Leave it all behind and come to the well 
 Leave it all behind 
 Leave it all behind 
 Leave it all behind 
 Leave it all behind 
 Leave it all behind 
 Your pursuit of perfection (leave it all behind) 
 Your fear of rejection (leave it all behind) 
 Your temporary pleasures (leave it all behind) 
 All your earthly treasures (leave it all behind) 
 Dried up empty religion (just leave it all behind) 
 Rusty chains of addition (leave it all behind) 
 All the guilt that weighs you down (leave it all behind) 
 Just leave it all behind (leave it all behind) 
 And come to the well

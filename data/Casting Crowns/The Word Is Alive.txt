Looking out from His throne, the Father of light and of men 
 Chose to make Himself known and show us the way back to Him 
 Speaking wisdom and truth into the hearts of peasants and kings 
 He began to unveil the Word that would change the course of all things 
 With eyes wide open, all would see 
 The Word is alive 
 And it cuts like a sword through the darkness 
 With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid 
 Breathing life into all who believe 
 The Word is alive 
 And the world and its glories will fade 
 But His truth, it will not pass away 
 It remains yesterday and forever the same 
 The Word is alive 
 Simple strokes on a page 
 Eternity's secrets revealed, carried on from age to age 
 It speaks Truth to us even still 
 And as the ran falls from Heaven, feeds the earth before it returns 
 Lord, let Your World fall on us and bring forth the fruit You deserve 
 With eyes wide open, let us see 
 The Word is alive 
 And it cuts like a sword through the darkness 
 With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid 
 Breathing life into all who believe 
 The Word is alive 
 And the world and its glories will fade 
 But His truth, it will not pass away 
 It remains yesterday and forever the same 
 The Word is alive 
 Spoken: 
 The Bible was inscribed over a period of 2,000 years, 
 In times of war and in days of peace, 
 By kings, physicians, tax collectors, farmers, fishermen, singers, and shepherds. 
 The marvel is that a library so perfectly cohesive 
 Could have been produced by such a diverse crowd over a period of time which staggers the imagination. 
 Jesus is its grand subject,  our good is designed, and the glory of God is its end. 
 The Word is alive 
 And it cuts like a sword through the darkness 
 With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid 
 Breathing life into all who believe 
 The Word is alive 
 And the world and its glories will fade 
 But His truth, it will not pass away 
 It remains yesterday and forever the same 
 The Word is alive 
 And the world and its glories will fade 
 The Word is alive 
 His truth, it will not pass away 
 His Word is alive 
 His Word is alive, His Word is alive 
 Spoken: 
 Jesus is its grand subject,  our good is designed, and the glory of God is its end.

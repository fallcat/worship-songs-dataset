Standing at the waters edge 
 I dropped my dreams when I dropped my nets 
 No hesitation, no regrets 
 I followed You 
 But that was then 
 And this is now 
 You washed my feet and You changed my name 
 I swore I'd never be the same 
 But just like the tides, I guess people change 
 'Cause that was then 
 And this is now 
 I wish I could go back but I don't know how 
 I remember when I stood my ground 
 I swore I'd never let You down 
 I want to be that man again 
 But that was then 
 And this is now 
 I watched the blind man lift his head 
 And look his Savior in the eyes 
 I heard a dead man take a breath 
 Dropped to my knees as I watched him rise 
 And I felt the sea beneath my feet 
 As I stepped out on the angry waves 
 But You saw the storm raging within 
 You reached out and calmed me then 
 But this is now 
 I wish I could go back but I don't know how 
 I remember when I stood my ground 
 I swore I'd never let You down 
 I want to be that man again 
 But that was then 
 And this is now 
 Just when I thought my sin has closed the door 
 I see my Savior standing on the shore 
 With arms wide open 
 Just like the first time You called my name 
 You said that was then 
 And this is now 
 My child, I bore your cross, I wore your crown 
 When you couldn't come to me, my love came down 
 So take My hand, I'll lead you out 
 'Cause that was then 
 And this is now 
 My child, I bore your cross, I wore your crown 
 You couldn't come to me so my love came down 
 Take my hand, Ill lead you out 
 You'll never be that man again 
 'Cause that was then 
 And this is now

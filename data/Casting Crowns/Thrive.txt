Here in this worn and weary land 
 Where many a dream has died 
 Like a tree planted by the water 
 We never will run dry 
 So living water flowing through 
 God, we thirst for more of You 
 Fill our hearts and flood our souls with one desire 
 Just to know You and to make You known 
 We lift Your name on high 
 Shine like the sun, make darkness run and hide 
 We know we were made for so much more than ordinary lives 
 Its time for us to more than just survive 
 We were made to thrive 
 Into Your word, we're digging deep 
 To know our Father's heart 
 Into the world, we're reaching out 
 To show them who You are 
 So living water flowing through 
 God, we thirst for more of You 
 Fill our hearts and flood our souls with one desire 
 Just to know You and to make You known 
 We lift Your name on high 
 Shine like the sun, make darkness run and hide 
 We know we were made for so much more than ordinary lives 
 Its time for us to more than just survive 
 We were made to thrive 
 Joy unspeakable, faith unsinkable 
 Love unstoppable, anything is possible 
 Just to know You and to make You known 
 We lift Your name on high 
 Shine like the sun, make darkness run and hide 
 We know we were made for so much more than ordinary lives 
 Its time for us to more than just survive 
 We were made to thrive 
 We were made to thrive

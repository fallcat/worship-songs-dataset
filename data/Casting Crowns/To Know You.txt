To know You is to never worry for my life 
 To know You is to never give into compromise and 
 To know You is to want to tell the world about You 
 'Cause I can't live without You 
 To know You is to hear Your voice when You are calling 
 To know You is to catch my brother when he is falling 
 To know You is to feel the pain of the brokenhearted 
 'Cause they can't live without You 
 More than my next breath 
 More than life or death 
 All I'm reaching for, I live my life to know You more 
 I leave it all behind, You're all that satisfies 
 To know You is to want to know You more 
 To know You is to want to know You more 
 To know You is to ache for more than ordinary 
 To know You is to look beyond the temporary 
 To know You is believing that You'll be enough 
 'Cause there's no life without You 
 More than my next breath 
 More than life or death 
 All I'm reaching for, I live my life to know You more 
 I leave it all behind, You're all that satisfies 
 To know You is to want to know You more 
 To know You is to want to know You more 
 All this life could offer me 
 Could not compare to You, compare to You (I want to know You more) 
 And I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You, knowing You 
 More than my next breath 
 More than life or death 
 All I'm reaching for, I live my life to know You more 
 I leave it all behind, You're all that satisfies 
 To know You is to want to know You more 
 To know You is to want to know You more 
 All this life could offer me 
 Could not compare to You, compare to You 
 And I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You, knowing You 
 And I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You, knowing You

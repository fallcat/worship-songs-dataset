Lord, I want to feel with Your heart 
 See the world through Your eyes 
 I want to be Your hands and feet 
 I want to live a life that leads 
 Ready yourselves, ready yourselves 
 Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night, woah 
 Ready yourselves, ready yourselves 
 May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise 
 Until the whole world hears, Lord, we are calling out 
 Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound 
 Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out 
 And as the day draws near, we'll sing until the whole world hears 
 Lord, let Your sleeping giant rise 
 Catch the demons by surprise 
 Holy nations sanctify 
 Let this be our battle cry 
 Ready yourselves, ready yourselves 
 Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night, woah 
 Ready yourselves, ready yourselves 
 May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise 
 Until the whole world hears, Lord, we are calling out 
 Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound 
 Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out 
 And as the day draws near, we'll sing until the whole world hears 
 Woah, woah, sing until the whole world hears 
 Woah, woah, sing until the whole world hears 
 I want to be Your hands and feet 
 I want to live a life that leads 
 To see You set the captive free 
 Until the whole world hears 
 And I pray the day will see 
 More of You and less of me 
 Lord, I want my life to be 
 The song You sing 
 Until the whole world hears, Lord, we are calling out 
 Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound 
 Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out 
 And as the day draws near, we'll sing until the whole world hears 
 Woah, woah, we'll sing until the whole world hears 
 Woah, woah, we'll sing until the whole world hears 
 Woah, woah, we'll sing until the whole world hears 
 Woah, woah, we'll sing until the whole world hears 
 Woah, woah, we'll sing until the whole world hears

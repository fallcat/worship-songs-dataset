Oh what I would do to have 
 The kind of faith it takes to climb out of this boat I'm in 
 Onto the crashing waves 
 To step out of my comfort zone 
 Into the realm of the unknown where Jesus is 
 And He's holding out His hand 
 But the waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me 
 Reminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed 
 The waves they keep on telling me 
 Time and time again, "Boy, you'll never win!" 
 "You'll never win!" 
 But the voice of truth tells me a different story 
 The voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid!" 
 And the voice of truth says, "This is for My glory" 
 Out of all the voices calling out to me 
 I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth 
 Oh what I would do to have 
 The kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant 
 With just a sling and a stone 
 Surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors 
 Shaking in their armor 
 Wishing they'd have had the strength to stand 
 But the giant's calling out my name and he laughs at me 
 Reminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed 
 The giant keeps on telling me 
 Time and time again, "Boy you'll never win!" 
 "You'll never win!" 
 But the voice of truth tells me a different story 
 The voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid!" 
 And the voice of truth says, "This is for My glory" 
 Out of all the voices calling out to me 
 I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth 
 But this stone was just the right size 
 To put the giant on the ground 
 And the waves they don't seem so high 
 From on top of them lookin' down 
 I will soar with the wings of eagles 
 When I stop and listen to the sound of Jesus 
 Singing over me 
 The voice of truth tells me a different story 
 The voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid!" 
 And the voice of truth says, "This is for My glory" 
 Out of all the voices calling out to me 
 I will choose to listen and believe 
 I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth 
 I will listen and believe 
 I will listen and believe the voice of truth 
 I will listen and believe because Jesus, You are the voice of truth 
 And I will listen to You 
 You are

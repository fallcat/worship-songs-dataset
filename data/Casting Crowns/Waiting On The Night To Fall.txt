There's an old man living in the back of your woods tonight 
 You forgot he was even there, but you've never slipped his mind 
 He's living off of scraps of you you never knew you left behind 
 And as the sun goes down, he rises with a smile 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 The old man's coming to call 
 You don't see the writing on the wall 
 He'll never step out in the light 
 No, he's just biding time 
 And while you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 He knows you have the answers, but Truth lies dusty on your shelf 
 And the sword that you could slay him with has become an ornament and nothing else 
 You could put him back down in his hole in the ground, but he knows you never will 
 He's been around so long you got used to the smell 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 The old man's coming to call 
 You don't see the writing on the wall 
 He'll never step out in the light 
 No, he's just biding time 
 And while you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 He knows he'll never have your soul 
 But he will gladly rob you blind 
 While you're feasting at his table, he'll tie your hands and numb your mind 
 He'll take you farther than you wanna go 
 He'll keep you longer than you wanna stay 
 And it will cost you more than you ever thought you'd pay 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 The old man's coming to call 
 You don't see the writing on the wall 
 He'll never step out in the light 
 No, he's just biding time 
 And while you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 He's waiting on the night 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 The old man's coming to call 
 But you don't see, you don't see the writing on the wall 
 He's waiting on the night 
 He's waiting on the night to fall 
 He's waiting on the night to fall

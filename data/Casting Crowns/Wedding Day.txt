There's a stirring in the throne room 
 And all creation holds its breath 
 Waiting now to see the Bridegroom 
 Wondering how the bride will dress 
 And she wears white 
 And she knows that she's undeserving 
 She bears the shame of history 
 But this worn and weary maiden 
 Is not the bride that He sees 
 She wears white head to toe 
 But only He could make it so 
 When someone dries your tears 
 When someone wins your heart 
 And says you're beautiful 
 When you don't know you are 
 When all you long to see 
 Is written on His face 
 Love has come and finally set you free 
 On that wedding day 
 On that wedding day 
 She has danced in golden castles 
 She has crawled through beggar's dust 
 But today she stands before Him 
 And she wears His righteousness 
 She will be who He adores 
 This is what He made her for 
 When someone dries your tears 
 When someone wins your heart 
 And says you're beautiful 
 When you don't know you are 
 When all you long to see 
 Is written on His face 
 Love has come and finally set you free 
 When the hand that bears the only scars 
 In Heaven touch her face 
 And the last tears she'll ever cry 
 Are finally wiped away 
 And the clouds roll back as He takes her hand 
 And walks her through the gates 
 Forever we will reign 
 We will reign 
 When someone dries your tears 
 When someone wins your heart 
 And says you're beautiful 
 You're beautiful 
 When you don't know you are 
 When all you long to see 
 Is written on His face 
 Your beautiful face 
 Love has come and finally set you free 
 On that wedding day 
 On that wedding day 
 On that wedding day 
 On that wedding day

What if the armies of the Lord 
 Picked up and dusted off their swords 
 Vowed to set the captives free 
 And not let Satan have one more 
 What if the church, for heaven's sake 
 Finally stepped up to the plate 
 Took a stand upon God's promise 
 And stormed hell's rusty gates 
 What if His people prayed 
 And those who bear His name 
 Would humbly seek His face, yeah 
 And turn from their own way 
 And what would happen if we prayed 
 For those raised up to lead the way 
 Then maybe kids in school could pray 
 And unborn children see the light of day 
 What if the life that we pursue 
 Came from a hunger for the truth 
 What if the family turned to Jesus 
 Stopped asking Oprah what to do 
 What if His people prayed 
 And those who bear His name 
 Would humbly seek His face, yeah 
 And turn from their own way 
 He said that they would hear 
 His promise has been made 
 He'll answer loud and clear, yeah 
 If only we would pray 
 If My people called by My name 
 If they'll humble themselves and pray 
 If My people called by My name 
 If they'll humble themselves and pray 
 What if His people prayed 
 If My people called by My name 
 And those who bear His name 
 Would humbly seek His face, yeah 
 If they'll humble themselves and pray 
 And turn from their own ways 
 He said that they would hear 
 If My people called by My name 
 His promise has been made 
 He'll answer loud and clear, yeah 
 If they'll humble themselves and pray 
 If only we would pray 
 What if His people prayed 
 If My people called by My name 
 If they'll humble themselves and pray    If my people would pray 
 If My people called by My name

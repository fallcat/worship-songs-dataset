All my life I longed to be a hero 
 My sword raised high, running to the battle 
 I was going to take giants down 
 Be a man you would write about 
 Deep in my chest is the heart of a warrior 
 So why am I still standing here 
 Why am I still holding back from You 
 I hear You call me out into deeper waters 
 But I settle on the shallow end 
 So why am I still standing here 
 So afraid what it might cost to follow You 
 I'd walk by faith if I could get these feet to move 
 But I don't want to live that way 
 I don't want to look back someday 
 On a life that never stepped across the line 
 So why am I still standing here 
 Why am I still holding back from You 
 You've given me a faith that can move a mountain 
 But I'm still playing in the sand 
 Building little kingdoms that'll never stand 
 I hear You call me out into deeper waters 
 But I settle on the shallow end 
 I'm so tired of standing here 
 What if I gave everything to You 
 What if I gave everything 
 What if I stopped holding back from You 
 Starting now I'm stepping out onto deeper waters 
 What if I gave everything 
 What if I stopped holding back from You 
 Starting now I'm stepping out onto deeper waters 
 I want to see some mountains move 
 Ready to give everything 
 Say goodbye to standing here

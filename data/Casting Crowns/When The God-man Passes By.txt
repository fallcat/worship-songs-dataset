When the God-man passes by 
 The blind will see and the dead will rise 
 Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight 
 When the God-man passes by 
 I was a hollow man 
 My treachery despised and rightly so 
 And even though my chains were gone 
 I'm still a slave and reaping what I've sown 
 Call it desperation, I just had to see His face 
 So like a child, I climbed a sycamore tree 
 When the God-man called my name 
 I knew I'd never be the same 
 'Cause when the God-man passes by 
 The blind will see and the dead will rise 
 Redeemed will dance and broken wings take flight 
 When the God-man passes by 
 I was a runaway, a gypsy chasing shadows in the night 
 A prisoner of secrets till religion dragged my shame into the light 
 All my darkness was revealed, just when I thought my fate was sealed 
 My accusers dropped their stones and walked away 
 'Cause when the God-man cleansed my name 
 I knew I'd never be the same 
 You can come just as you are 
 Let Him have your broken heart 
 You have never run too far 
 There is freedom in His scars 
 When the God-man passes by

Oh little town of Bethlehem 
 Looks like another silent night 
 Above your deep and dreamless sleep 
 A giant star lights up the sky 
 And while you're lying in the dark 
 There shines an everlasting light 
 For the King has left His throne 
 And is sleeping in a manger tonight 
 Tonight 
 Oh Bethlehem, what you have missed while you were sleeping 
 For God became a man 
 And stepped into your world today 
 Oh Bethlehem, you will go down in history 
 As a city with no room for its King 
 While you were sleeping 
 While you were sleeping 
 Oh little town of Jerusalem 
 Looks like another silent night 
 The Father gave His only Son 
 The Way, the Truth, the Life had come 
 But there was no room for Him in the world He came to save 
 Jerusalem, what you have missed while you were sleeping 
 The Savior of the world is dying on your cross today 
 Jerusalem, you will go down in history 
 As a city with no room for its King 
 While you were sleeping 
 While you were sleeping 
 United States of America 
 Looks like another silent night 
 As we're sung to sleep by philosophies 
 That save the trees and kill the children 
 And while we're lying in the dark 
 There's a shout heard 'cross the eastern sky 
 For the Bridegroom has returned 
 And has carried His bride away in the night 
 In the night 
 America, what will we miss while we are sleeping 
 Will Jesus come again 
 And leave us slumbering where we lay 
 America, will we go down in history 
 As a nation with no room for its King 
 Will we be sleeping 
 Will we be sleeping 
 United States of America 
 Looks like another silent night

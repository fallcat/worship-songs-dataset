Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth 
 Would care to know my name 
 Would care to feel my hurt 
 Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star 
 Would choose to light the way 
 For my ever wandering heart 
 Not because of who I am 
 But because of what You've done 
 Not because of what I've done 
 But because of who You are 
 I am a flower quickly fading 
 Here today and gone tomorrow 
 A wave tossed in the ocean 
 A vapor in the wind 
 Still You hear me when I'm calling 
 Lord, You catch me when I'm falling 
 And You've told me who I am 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin 
 Would look on me with love and watch me rise again 
 Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea 
 Would call out through the rain 
 And calm the storm in me 
 Not because of who I am 
 But because of what You've done 
 Not because of what I've done 
 But because of who You are 
 I am a flower quickly fading 
 Here today and gone tomorrow 
 A wave tossed in the ocean 
 A vapor in the wind 
 Still You hear me when I'm calling 
 Lord, You catch me when I'm falling 
 And You've told me who I am 
 I am, I am Yours 
 Not because of who I am 
 But because of what You've done 
 Not because of what I've done 
 But because of who You are 
 I am a flower quickly fading 
 Here today and gone tomorrow 
 A wave tossed in the ocean 
 A vapor in the wind 
 Still You hear me when I'm calling 
 Lord, You catch me when I'm falling 
 And You've told me who I am 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 Whom shall I fear 
 Whom shall I fear 
 'Cause I am Yours 
 I am Yours

One more mother with a broken heart 
 One more family is torn apart 
 One more orphan out in the cold 
 One more fear that takes control 
 One more tangled in the same old lies 
 One more shackled to the same old highs 
 One more scared of what tomorrow brings 
 And one more chasing yesterday 
 Lord, let Your kingdom come 
 Who can right every wrong? 
 You are the only One 
 Who can calm every storm? 
 You are the only One 
 You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer 
 Lord of all 
 You are the only One 
 One more skeptic to believe 
 One more prisoner has been set free 
 One more longs to be Your hands and feet 
 One more standing for the least of these 
 One more praying in the morning light 
 One more shining in the darkest night 
 One more life worth fighting for 
 No greater love worth dying for 
 Lord, let Your kingdom come 
 Lord, let Your will be done 
 Who can right every wrong? 
 You are the only One 
 Who can calm every storm? 
 You are the only One 
 You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer 
 Lord of all 
 You are the only One 
 You are the only One 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to make You known 
 I want this world to see 
 That You're alive in me 
 Jesus, You're the only One 
 Who can right every wrong? 
 You are the only One 
 Who can calm every storm? 
 You are the only One 
 You alone are Father, Savior, Spirit, Healer, Redeemer 
 Lord of all 
 You are the only One 
 (Father, Savior, Spirit) 
 You are the only One 
 (Redeemer, Lord of all) 
 You are the only One

Your love is extravagant 
 Your friendship, it is intimate 
 I feel like moving to the rhythm of Your grace 
 Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place 
 'Cause Your love is extravagant 
 Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin 
 No greater love have I ever known; You considered me a friend 
 Capture my heart again 
 Your love is extravagant 
 Your friendship, it is intimate 
 I feel like moving to the rhythm of Your grace 
 Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place 
 And Your love is extravagant 
 Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin 
 No greater love have I ever known; You considered me a friend 
 Spread wide in the arms of Christ is the love that covers sin 
 No greater love have I ever known; You considered me a friend 
 Capture my heart again 
 Your love is extravagant 
 Your friendship, it is intimate

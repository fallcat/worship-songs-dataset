You split the sky to meet me here 
 And breathe into the atmosphere 
 You tear the veil to make a way 
 In holiness I'm face to face 
 Here and now have my attention 
 You've won me 
 Here and now have my affection 
 You've got me 
 Oh You never stop seeking 
 You never stop reaching out 
 You never stop seeking 
 After my heart 
 You're after my heart 
 So have Your way and speak again 
 Remind me of Your promises 
 Of who You are and all You've done 
 How all of me is all You want 
 You've got me 
 You've got me 
 Right where You want me 
 You've won me 
 You've won me 
 Won me completely

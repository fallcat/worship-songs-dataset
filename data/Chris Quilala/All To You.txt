Take the keys to my heart 
 Investigate every part 
 Place Your seal on my chest 
 All for You, all my best 
 I have made my choice 
 I have set my course 
 All to You, all to You 
 Your love has marked my life 
 So I will give my life 
 All to You, all to You 
 Like a fire to the coal 
 Light the flame, make me glow 
 Forever Yours, in Your hand 
 All I have and all I am 
 All we'll have, a final breath 
 Let mine be filled with praise for You 
 And everything from now till then 
 Be a song, be a song I sing for You 
 All we'll have, a final breath 
 Let mine be filled with praise for You 
 And everything from now till then 
 Be a song, be a song I sing for You 
 All to You, all to You

There was a chasm uncrossable 
 There was a mountain unscalable 
 Even when my lost heart was unlovable 
 You spread Your arms out 
 You laid down Your life for me 
 Now I'm set free 
 Now my heart sings 
 Because of Your love 
 Hallelujah, I'm forgiven 
 The shadow has been lifted 
 You rescued me 
 Because of Your love 
 I can stand with You forever 
 In the presence of my Savior 
 Alive and free 
 Because of Your love 
 Because of Your love 
 Where there were years of drought, now overflow 
 Where there was guilt and shame, now joys untold 
 When my heart was a prodigal 
 And the lies were deafening 
 Your love was a whisper 
 Your love kept whispering to me 
 That I am Your and You are mine 
 There is no greater love 
 There is no greater love than this, Your great love 
 There is no sweeter name 
 Nothing can separate us from Your great love 
 There is no greater love 
 There is no higher love than this, Your great love 
 There is no sweeter name 
 Nothing can separate us from Your great love

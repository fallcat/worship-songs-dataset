You're the mighty rushing wind 
 You're the calm upon the lake 
 We can see Your fingerprints 
 In the mountains and the waves 
 I know You wanna move 
 So I won't be afraid 
 I'm calling our Your name 
 Holy Spirit fall on us 
 Holy Spirit fall on us 
 Come rush into this room 
 All we want is You 
 Holy Spirit fall on us 
 Be the breath within my lungs 
 Be the sound of my heartbeat 
 Be the holy raging fire 
 Deep inside of me 
 We won't stop 
 No, we won't stop 
 Till we meet You 
 Till we see You 
 We won't stop 
 No, we won't stop 
 Till we encounter You

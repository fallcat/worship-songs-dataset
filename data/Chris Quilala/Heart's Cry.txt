Humble I come, astounded You know my name 
 My song and my strength, Jesus my hiding place 
 Oh, my soul will sing 
 Christ alive in me 
 This is my heart's cry, to be a reflection of You 
 I want to be holy like You are holy 
 Lord, make me more like You 
 Ancient of days, You are enthroned in praise 
 Matchless in strength, perfect in all Your ways 
 Oh, my soul will sing 
 This is my heart's cry, to be a reflection of You 
 I want to be holy like You are holy 
 Lord, make me more like You 
 Oh Lord, make me more like You 
 For all my days, my soul sings holy 
 More than a song, my life sings holy 
 Holy, holy, You are holy 
 For all my days, my soul sings holy 
 More than a song, my life sings holy 
 Holy, holy, You are holy 
 Lord, make me more like You 
 Oh Lord, make me more like You 
 I want to be more like You

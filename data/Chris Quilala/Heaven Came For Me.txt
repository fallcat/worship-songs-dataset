Your love was fierce when my strength was failing 
 Your grip secure when I lost my way 
 Your word was light though the day was fading 
 Through every storm, You were faithful 
 Hallelujah, heaven came for me 
 Love has marked my heart for eternity 
 In Your kindness, You have chosen me 
 Hallelujah, heaven came 
 For me 
 Your grace was there at my weakest moment 
 Your joy was found in the midst of pain 
 You have redeemed all that hell had stolen 
 Through even death, You are faithful 
 On that day 
 That heaven came 
 You took my sin 
 You robbed the grave 
 So come what may 
 My soul is claimed 
 Forevermore 
 In Jesus name 
 Hallelujah, heaven came for me 
 Love has marked my heart for eternity 
 In Your kindness, You have chosen me 
 Hallelujah, heaven came 
 For me

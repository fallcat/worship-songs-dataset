These lifted hands can't count the reasons 
 Why He is worthy of such praise 
 This voice could never sing enough songs 
 His majesty is far too great 
 Only one God is worthy 
 Only one name remains 
 Only one King stands sovereign 
 There will ever be only one God 
 His power alone makes all hell tremble 
 And even death itself bows down 
 All of creation bows before Him 
 The One who's crowned with many crowns 
 Only one God is worthy 
 Only one name remains 
 Only one King stands sovereign 
 There will ever be only one God 
 Only one God 
 Let our praise like thunder roll and shake the ground 
 Let it shake the ground 
 Let our praise like thunder roll and shake the ground 
 Let it shake the ground 
 Let our praise like thunder roll and shake the ground 
 Let it shake the ground 
 Let our praise like thunder roll and shake the ground 
 Let it shake the ground 
 Only one God is worthy 
 Only one name remains 
 Only one King stands sovereign 
 There will ever be only one God 
 Only one God 
 Only one God

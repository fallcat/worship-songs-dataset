Before anybody takes a stage 
 Let them feel You moving 
 Before anybody sings a word 
 Let them feel You working 
 Let it be more than just what my eyes can see 
 Let it be obvious, kingdom come in me 
 King Jesus 
 Take the highest place 
 Reign, reign 
 Here in me 
 Heaven on display 
 Reign, reign 
 God, I never wanna lose the wonder of Your presence 
 Won't You captivate my heart again 
 I surrender, I surrender 
 King Jesus 
 Take the highest place 
 Reign, reign 
 Here in me 
 Heaven on display 
 Reign, reign 
 Reign, reign, reign 
 The heavens shake with Your praise 
 Name above every name 
 In my life, in this place 
 Have Your way 
 A thousand songs cannot contain 
 Your endless worth, Your majesty 
 In my life, in this place 
 Have Your way 
 Reign

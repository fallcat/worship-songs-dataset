Your love has led me to surrender 
 To renounce my rights and resign my fear 
 And trust before I know the answer 
 Laying down my life at the Shepherd's feet 
 Come rushing like a river through my soul 
 With Your streams of living water 
 And Your love that overflows 
 I find here in Your presence all I need 
 Here I lay my life before You 
 I will give You everything 
 I hide myself beneath Your shadow 
 Here I find my rest underneath Your wings 
 I come with weights that I can't carry 
 Here I lay them down, leave them at Your feet 
 I am surrounded when I surrender 
 In Your presence I know I don't have to hide 
 For it's Your kindness that draws me closer 
 To the river where my soul is satisfied

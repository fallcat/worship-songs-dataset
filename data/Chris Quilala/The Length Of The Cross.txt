You walked through the fire 
 You searched through the rain 
 For the one that was missing 
 That had drifted away 
 You spoke into darkness 
 You broke through the chains 
 The light in the tunnel 
 You were calling my name 
 How long will You wait for me 
 And how vast is Your love for me 
 And how far would You run for me 
 The length of the cross 
 How wide is Your heart for me 
 And how high is Your hope for me 
 And what price did You pay for me 
 The length of the cross 
 You stepped down from heaven 
 For beggars and thieves 
 To dwell here among us 
 You were coming for me 
 Enduring the suffering 
 Despising the shame 
 With the world on Your shoulders 
 You were calling my name

Breath of heaven 
 Voice of thunder 
 In Your presence 
 I surrender 
 All consuming 
 Holy fire 
 In Your presence 
 I surrender 
 Spirit of the living God 
 Spirit of the living God 
 You are welcome here 
 You are welcome here 
 God of heaven 
 Move in power 
 In Your presence 
 I surrender 
 Grave defeated 
 Chains are lifted 
 In Your presence 
 I surrender 
 All of heaven 
 Every creature 
 Anthem rising 
 Lifting higher 
 Mountains bowing 
 Oceans roaring 
 All the glory 
 To You forever 
 You are welcome 
 You are welcome here 
 Spirit of God 
 You are welcome here

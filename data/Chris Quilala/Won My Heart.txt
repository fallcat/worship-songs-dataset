I was a wasteland where nothing could grow 
 But everything changed when You called it Your home 
 Now I'm a kingdom, You sit on the throne 
 Broke my defenses, made me Your own 
 You have won my heart, You have won my heart 
 From the heights to the shores, every part, I am Yours 
 You have won my heart, You have won my heart 
 All of me surrendering, what a sweet victory 
 Your love is a soldier fighting a war 
 Broke through the front lines to stand in my door 
 Beautiful in defeat, completely surrendered 
 I surrender 
 Never knew I could be so free in surrender 
 I surrender

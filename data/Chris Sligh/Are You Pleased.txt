Can You see through all these filthy rags 
 That I like to call my good 
 And see the mirror of my heart reflecting You 
 I know You listen to me but what do You hear 
 Am I lovely to Your ear? 
 All I want is to hear You say well done 
 Are You pleased with me? 
 Am I everything You want for me to be? 
 Are You pleased? 
 I know that I am nothing outside of who You are 
 And it's You I should be striving to become 
 I know you're watching over me, but what do You see 
 Am I moving towards the grace that covers me? 
 All I want is to hear You say well done 
 Are You pleased with me? 
 Am I everything You want for me to be? 
 Am I drawing closer to You? 
 Is my heart deciding You are all I need? 
 Oh, are You pleased? 
 Oh, I know I could never do enough on my own 
 But still You see me through the precious blood 
 Oh, it's only the blood of Jesus 
 All I want is to hear You say well done 
 Are You pleased, yeah with me? 
 Am I everything You want for me to be? 
 Am I drawing closer to You? 
 Is my heart deciding You are all I need? 
 Are You pleased with me?

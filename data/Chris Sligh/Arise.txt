Stars go down in the western sky 
 The light fades in as the darkness dies 
 Sunlight, sweet sunlight brings the day that You've created 
 Perfect remedy for all that tears at me 
 Arise, arise with the morning 
 Arise, Your mercies are new 
 Arise, arise with the morning 
 That finds me running back to You 
 Darkness comes and covers all my faults 
 Tears fall down and sting my wounds like salt 
 Hopes fade till I'm caught in the day that You've created 
 Perfect remedy for all that tears at me 
 Arise, arise with the morning 
 Arise, Your mercies are new 
 Arise, arise with the morning 
 That finds me running back to You 
 I'm anxiously waiting 
 Redemption is brimming with the stories created 
 Each new day I know You are coming 
 Arise, arise with the morning 
 Arise, Your mercies are new 
 Arise, arise with the morning 
 That finds me running back to You 
 I'm running back to You

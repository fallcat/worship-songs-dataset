Collect all the broken pieces 
 Gather the memories one by one 
 Put all of the photographs into a box 
 That proves you're done 
 We've all had defining moments 
 We've all had our hearts torn from our chest 
 If time makes the heart grow fonder 
 What lets your heart get over this? 
 Love is patient, love is kind 
 But not always the first time 
 You fall then you break, that's all that it takes 
 To make up your mind to hold out for next time 
 You breathe in the change, till you feel love again 
 The end's the beginning not the end 
 Forget all the well-placed damage 
 Let go of the shadows left behind 
 The footprints of love's sweet carnage 
 Slips further behind you with the time 
 Love is good, love never fails 
 But leaves you behind to tell the tale 
 You fall then you break, that's all that it takes 
 To make up your mind to hold out for next time 
 You breathe in the change, till you feel love again 
 The end's the beginning not the end 
 You're never gonna understand 
 The mysteries of love and man 
 No matter how you break your neck to try 
 You live, you love, you lose control 
 You hold on tight, you let it go 
 You never understand the reasons why 
 You're the one that's left behind 
 You fall then you break, that's all that it takes 
 To make up your mind to hold out for next time 
 You breathe in the change, till you feel love again 
 The end's the beginning not the end 
 You fall then you break, that's all that it takes 
 To make up your mind to hold out for next time 
 You breathe in the change, till you feel love again 
 The end's the beginning not the end

We're broken in two with love as an anchor 
 There's nothing to do but give in, give in 
 Mirror less eyes give off a reflection 
 The moonlight is fair as we rise again 
 Oh, can we move on, can we move on 
 From the love we've left behind? 
 Oh, can we move on, can we move on 
 From the love we'll never find? 
 We're giving into sweet desperation 
 When all this is through, we'll give in, give in 
 Channels of grace give off the aroma 
 Of love mixed with pain and hope raised again 
 Oh, can we move on, can we move on 
 From the love we've left behind? 
 Oh, can we move on, can we move on 
 From the love we'll never find? 
 The world is broken in too many pieces 
 But the brokenness is beautiful, it's beautiful 
 My heart is broken by beauty's mysteries 
 But the brokenness is beautiful, it's beautiful 
 Oh, can we move on, can we move on 
 From the love we've left behind? 
 Oh, can we move on, can we move on 
 From the love we'll never find? Yeah 
 The world is broken in too many pieces 
 But the brokenness is beautiful, it's beautiful 
 My heart is broken by beauty's mysteries 
 But the brokenness is beautiful, it's beautiful

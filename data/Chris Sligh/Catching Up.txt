We'll both pretend that everything is fine 
 Until the morning time 
 When light cuts through the shadows where we hid 
 We shadow box the morning light 
 With covers in our hands too tight 
 We curse away the sight of our mistake 
 And oh, it's catching up 
 And oh, it's catching up with us 
 We all pretend we're making it 
 'Cause we can't admit we're faking it 
 In a world we won't believe is never right 
 We'll cover up just one more time 
 The sin we hope nobody finds 
 We tiptoe to the line of our mistakes 
 And oh, it's catching up 
 And oh, it's catching up with us 
 And oh, we need more time 
 And oh, we need more time 
 My drug of choice is detectable 
 But my sickness isn't catchable 
 'Cause all of us are sick with what I have 
 I'm sick with self and sick from pride 
 I'm sick of all the times I've lied 
 I've struggled and I've tried to be all right 
 But oh, it's catching up 
 And oh, it's catching up with us 
 And oh, it's catching up 
 And oh, it's catching up with us 
 It's catching up with us

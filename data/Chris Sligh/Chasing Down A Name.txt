We all see the mystery that plays out in our heads 
 We dream that we're the hero, not just who we are instead 
 Every step and every sight, a clue not what it seems 
 But every clue we're chasing down is all part of this dream 
 We are all the same, we are all the same 
 We are all the same, we're chasing down a name 
 We all need a family, we're never satisfied 
 With what we have we're chasing down a dream that never died 
 Good but never good enough, we're dark down to our soul 
 Lives spent flashing all we have but we never fill the hole 
 We are all the same, we are all the same 
 We are all the same, we're chasing down a name 
 All we are is a prodigal, a life well spent is never full 
 We change our name, we're all the same 
 Love is what we've heard before but we all play the game 
 All we are is a prodigal, yeah 
 Fallen, we are fallen but forgiven even more 
 The letter on our chest reminds us we are still the whore 
 We're runaways, we're done ways, we are the cast aside 
 But now our name is caught up, in our Christ we are the bride 
 We are all the same, we are all the same 
 We are all the same, we're chasing down a name 
 Yeah, we are all the same, we are all the same 
 We are all the same, we're chasing down a name 
 We're chasing down a name 
 We're chasing down a name

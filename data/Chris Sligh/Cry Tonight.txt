You could never understand, just how scared I am 
 I've lived and loved and lost a thousand times 
 Is this a second chance 
 Just to make it pass all this energy? 
 I don't wanna cry tonight 
 Don't wanna hang my heart on my sleeve 
 But You're everything my soul could ever need 
 I don't wanna cry tonight 
 Just a little faith gets us further in this race 
 We all know trust don't come too easily 
 Is this just romance 
 Or will we take a chance on something beautiful? 
 I don't wanna cry tonight 
 Don't wanna hang my heart on my sleeve 
 But You're everything my soul could ever need 
 I don't wanna cry tonight 
 Don't wanna know my heart's broke in two 
 'Cause all I'll ever need right here is You 
 I don't wanna cry tonight 
 Don't say it's hard enough to be myself 
 'Cause all I ever need is You, all I need is You 
 I don't wanna cry tonight 
 Don't wanna hang my heart on my sleeve 
 But You're everything my soul could ever need 
 I don't wanna cry tonight 
 Don't wanna know my heart's broke in two 
 'Cause all I'll ever need right here is You 
 I don't wanna cry tonight

I've had just enough of the spotlight when it burns bright 
 To see how it gets in the blood. 
 And I've tasted my share of the sweet life and the wild ride 
 And found a little is not quite enough. 
 I know how I can stray 
 And how fast my heart could change. 
 Empty me of the selfishness inside 
 Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride 
 And any foolish thing my heart holds to 
 Lord empty me of me so I can be filled with you. 
 I've seen just enough of the quick buys of the best lies 
 To know how prodigals can be drawn away. 
 I know how I can stray 
 And how fast my heart could change. 
 Empty me of the selfishness inside 
 Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride 
 And any foolish thing my heart holds to 
 Lord empty me of me so I can be filled with you. 
 Cause everything is a lesser thing 
 Compared to you, compared to you. 
 Cause everything is a lesser thing 
 Compared to you so I surrender all 
 Empty me of the selfishness inside 
 Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride 
 Empty me of the selfishness inside 
 Every vain ambition and the poison of my pride 
 And any foolish thing my heart holds to 
 Lord empty me of me so I can be 
 Lord empty me of me so I can be filled with you. 
 Oh, filled with you. 
 Empty me.

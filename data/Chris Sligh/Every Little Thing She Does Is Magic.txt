Though I've tried before to tell her 
 Of the feelings I have for her in my heart 
 Every time that I come near her 
 I just lose my nerve 
 As I've done from the start 
 Every little thing she does is magic 
 Everything she do just turns me on 
 Even though my life before was tragic 
 Now I know my love for her goes on 
 Do I have to tell the story 
 Of a thousand rainy days since we first met 
 It's a big enough umbrella 
 But it's always me that ends up getting wet 
 Every little thing she does is magic 
 Everything she do just turns me on 
 Even though my life before was tragic 
 Now I know my love for her goes on 
 I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day 
 And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way 
 But my silent fears have gripped me 
 Long before I reach the phone 
 Long before my tongue has tripped me 
 Must I always be alone? 
 Every little thing she does is magic 
 Everything she do just turns me on 
 Even though my life before was tragic 
 Now I know my love for her goes on

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag 
 Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? 
 Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin 
 Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in? 
 Do you ever feel already buried deep? 
 Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing 
 Do you know that there's still a chance for you 
 'Cause there's a spark in you? 
 You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine 
 Just own the night like the 4th of July 
 'Cause baby, you're a firework 
 Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
 Make 'em go, oh 
 As you shoot across the sky 
 Baby, you're a firework 
 Come on, let your colors burst 
 Make 'em go, oh 
 You're gonna leave 'em falling down 
 You don't have to feel like a waste of space 
 You're original, cannot be replaced 
 If you only knew what the future holds 
 After a hurricane comes a rainbow 
 Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed 
 So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
 Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow 
 And when it's time, you'll know 
 You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine 
 Just own the night like the 4th of July 
 'Cause baby you're a firework 
 Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
 Make 'em go, oh 
 As you shoot across the sky 
 Baby, you're a firework 
 Come on, let your colors burst 
 Make 'em go, oh 
 You're gonna leave 'em falling down 
 Boom, boom, boom 
 Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
 It's always been inside of you, you, you 
 And now it's time to let it through 
 'Cause baby you're a firework 
 Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
 Make 'em go, oh 
 As you shoot across the sky 
 Baby, you're a firework 
 Come on, let your colors burst 
 Make 'em go, oh 
 You're gonna leave 'em falling down 
 Boom, boom, boom 
 Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
 Boom, boom, boom 
 Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

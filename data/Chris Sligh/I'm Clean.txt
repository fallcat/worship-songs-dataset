Love is just a picture of Your glory 
 And my best tries at love have fallen short 
 I pretend these dirty clothes are holy 
 Knees patched up with grace from You, oh Lord 
 No one is righteous but I'm not the one You see 
 I'm clean, I'm covered by forgiveness here 
 And only You can forget all I've done 
 I'm clean through no good of my own 
 But when You look at me You see Your Son 
 And I am clean 
 Looking back, my past is worth forgetting 
 But every try brings me to my knees 
 Where I can see the shades of Your forgiving 
 Each color covers a sinful memory 
 No one is righteous but I'm not the one You see 
 I'm clean, I'm covered by forgiveness here 
 And only You can forget all I've done 
 I'm clean through no good of my own 
 But when You look at me You see Your Son 
 And I am clean 
 On my own I'm simply man at best 
 But my sin's as far as east from west 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 I'm clean covered by forgiveness here 
 And only You can forget all I've done 
 I'm clean through no good of my own 
 But when You look at me You see Your Son 
 And I am clean, oh I am clean, I am clean

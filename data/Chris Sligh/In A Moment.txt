In a moment love can pass you by 
 And in a moment a heart can come alive 
 Every moment's getting better 
 Every moment brings me closer to you 
 Can I hold you till the morning light 
 Takes away the dead of night 
 And sunrise shines on you? 
 Can love take all these fears away 
 Till morning comes with brand new day? 
 It's love that pulls us through in a moment 
 In a moment love can tear you down 
 And in a moment a heart can turn around 
 Every moment's getting better 
 Every moment brings me closer to you 
 Can I hold you till the morning light 
 Takes away the dead of night 
 And sunrise shines on you? 
 Can love take all these fears away 
 Till morning comes with brand new day? 
 And it's love that pulls us through in a moment 
 I feel you in my heart, I feel you in my soul 
 Oh, oh you make me whole in a moment 
 Can I hold you till the morning light 
 Takes away the dead of night 
 And sunrise shines on you? 
 Can love take all these fears away 
 Till morning comes with brand new day? 
 It's love that pulls us through in a moment 
 In a moment, in a moment

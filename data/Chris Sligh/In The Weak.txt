I wrap God in my perfect packages 
 A self-made box of wants and needs 
 With hands raised high, I sing my praise 
 And forget the ones left in the streets 
 But God does not reside 
 In churches made of stone 
 I will not find Him 
 In palaces of gold 
 He's in the weak, He's in the orphan 
 He's in the broken and abandoned 
 That have been too long ignored 
 He's crying out, His arms are reaching 
 We find him in the helpless and the poor, yeah 
 The least of these is who His heart beats for 
 So will we stand for the sake of justice? 
 Will we live in the name of love? 
 Will we defend the case of the fatherless 
 And take their cause up as our own? 
 'Cause God does not reside 
 In churches made of stone 
 We will not find Him 
 In palaces of gold 
 He's in the weak, He's in the orphan 
 He's in the broken and abandoned 
 That have been too long ignored 
 He's crying out, His arms are reaching 
 We find Him in the helpless and the poor, yeah 
 The least of these is who His heart beats for 
 With the same mercy 
 That we've been given 
 From His grace received 
 We must freely give, whoa 
 He's in the weak, He's in the orphan 
 He's in the broken and abandoned 
 That have been too long ignored 
 He's crying out, His arms are reaching 
 We find Him in the helpless and the poor, yeah 
 The least of these is who His heart beats for 
 He's in the weak, He's in the weak 
 Yeah, yeah

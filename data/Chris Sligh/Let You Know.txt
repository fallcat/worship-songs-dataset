Lost in the windows of time you see a time of change 
 Don't it all feel strange? 
 Stuck in the reverb of me I hear echoes of myself 
 But I can't say what I see 
 I'm finding the answers to my great divide 
 Someday when the sky is falling I will let You know 
 Someday when my dreams are caving in I will let You know 
 I'll let You know 
 Forget the first verse of life 
 There's nothing learned at all at least until you fall 
 Stratospheres and atmospheres collide 
 Worlds come to an end and there's nowhere left to hide 
 I'm finding the answers to my great divide 
 Someday when the sky is falling I will let You know 
 Someday when my dreams are caving in I will let You know 
 I'll let You know when I'm falling 
 I'll let You know when I'm calling 
 I'll let You know when I'm breaking 
 I'll let You know when I'm making it through 
 Someday when the sky is falling I will let You know 
 Someday when my dreams are caving in I will let You know 
 I'll let you know

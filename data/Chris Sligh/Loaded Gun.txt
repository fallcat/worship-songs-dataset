Love is a loaded gun and my trigger finger, lingers 
 Waiting for the right time to let this go 
 I know I'm not the only one who feels this 
 Hears this, is it a near miss? 
 'Cause I think it's finally time to let my feelings show 
 Are good intentions as far as I can go? 
 Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber 
 Big talk but nothing's ever changing 
 Take aim but never making my mark 
 Love can change the world 
 But it's gotta start with my heart 
 Love is a gift of one and it's all I can't buy 
 But I'm looking for a reason I can give it now 
 Every single mother's son reaches out for love from, someone 
 And I hold the key to breaking through the doubt 
 Are good intentions as far as I can go? 
 Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber 
 Big talk but nothing's ever changing 
 Take aim but never making my mark 
 Love can change the world 
 But it's gotta start with my heart 
 Are good intentions as far as I can go? 
 Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber 
 Big talk but nothing's ever changing 
 Take aim but never making my mark 
 Love can change the world 
 But it's gotta start with my heart 
 Kind words, just a bullet in a chamber 
 Big talk but nothing's ever changing 
 Take aim but never making my mark 
 Love can change the world 
 But it's gotta start with my heart

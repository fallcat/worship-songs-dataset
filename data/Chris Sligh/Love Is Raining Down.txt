Feels like the world is spinning out in all directions 
 Sometimes it seems like all this doubt is an infection 
 I'm feeling cold, feeling it's too late 
 I've got the strangest feeling that it's time to celebrate 
 Oh, but don't hesitate 
 Dance, dance, can you feel it now? 
 Shake, shake, can you hear the sound? 
 Move, move, do you feel it now? 
 Love, love, love is raining down 
 Love is raining down on me 
 Feels like the darkness in my head is slowly fading 
 While all the joy you give instead becomes engaging 
 Was shallow love given up too late? 
 I've got this strange suspicion that it's time to celebrate 
 Oh, but don't hesitate 
 Dance, dance, can you feel it now? 
 Shake, shake, can you hear the sound? 
 Move, move, do you feel it now? 
 Love, love, love is raining down 
 Love is raining down on me 
 Just let go, don't hesitate 
 Dance, dance, can you feel it now? 
 Shake, shake, can you hear the sound? 
 Move, move, do you feel it now? 
 Love, love, love is raining down 
 Love is raining down on me 
 Dance, dance, can you feel it now? 
 Shake, shake, can you hear the sound? 
 Move, move, do you feel it now? 
 Love, love, love is raining down 
 Love is raining down on me 
 Love is raining down on me

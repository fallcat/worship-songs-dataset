Color spreads across the sky, a new day is coming 
 But none of the questions have changed 
 Life moves too quickly, we're never quite settled 
 Circumstance changes but the fears stay the same 
 Love, love, love is the answer 
 For hands that are reaching and hearts bruised with life 
 There's hope for the weary, the broken and weak 
 'Cause love, love, love is the answer we need 
 All we are, are empty cups waiting for filling 
 We seek out acceptance and love 
 We're reaching for the better things but all that we're reaching 
 Is the feeling we never can get quite enough 
 Love, love, love is the answer 
 For hands that are reaching and hearts bruised with life 
 There's hope for the weary, the broken and weak 
 'Cause love, love, love is the answer we need 
 So come as you are, come to the water 
 Come and be thirsty no more 
 'Cause love, love, love is the answer 
 For hands that are reaching and hearts bruised with life 
 There's hope for the weary, the broken and weak 
 'Cause love, love, love is the answer we need

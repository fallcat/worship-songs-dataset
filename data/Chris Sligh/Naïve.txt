I understand that I don't 
 And it's one thing that I know 
 I ask new questions everyday 
 But nothing changes what I feel 
 The truth be told, I tell the truth 
 Still I struggle with it told 
 Do all these answers lead to you 
 Or some imagined pot of gold? Whoa 
 Oh, though I know 
 I don't wanna be so naïve 
 I'm holding on, holding on 
 The whispers in the dark say I'm a fool 
 And simple fools say I'm unwise 
 To trust in more than golden rules 
 And things I've witnessed with my eyes, oh 
 Oh, though I know 
 I don't wanna be so naïve 
 I'm holding on 
 Just holding on to love 
 I'm holding on to love, yeah 
 To cross the bridge that I have yet to burn 
 I'm holding on to you in spite of what I've learned 
 'Cause I have seen that love can be, oh 
 Oh, love can be beyond naïve 
 Oh, oh, though I know 
 I don't wanna be so naïve 
 I'm holding on 
 Just holding on to 
 Oh, though I know 
 I don't wanna be so naïve 
 I'm holding on 
 Just holding on to love, love

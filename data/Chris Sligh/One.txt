Holding onto our beliefs 
 Like a child holds to its father 
 It's like we're trying so hard to breathe 
 With our heads underneath the water 
 Keep trying to find the balance 
 Of our love and our convictions 
 'Cause we know that life in You 
 Moves far beyond religion 
 We know, we know 
 We know, we know 
 That nothing else even matters 
 But love 
 We keep trying to find a way 
 To come together 
 Lord, take these fears away 
 And make us one, one, one, whoa 
 Lord, make us one, one, one, Lord, make us one 
 We are the face of Christ 
 In a world of shadows 
 Is it God's love we're fighting for 
 Or our denomination's ego? 
 We got to let go of pride 
 Embrace the idea of difference 
 Make unity our calling 
 And move within forgiveness 
 We know, we know 
 We know, we know 
 That nothing else even matters 
 But love 
 We keep trying to find a way 
 To come together 
 Lord, take these fears away 
 And make us one, one, one, whoa 
 Lord, make us one, one, one, Lord, make us one 
 Imagine what could be, imagine what could change 
 If love was all that really mattered 
 Would the light of Christ finally shine through 
 Me and you?

 Make us one, one, one, whoa 
 Lord, make us one, one, one, Lord, make us one, oh 
 Make us one, one, one, whoa 
 Make us one, one, one, Lord, make us one, oh 
 Make us one, one, one, whoa 
 Make us one, one, one, Lord, make us one

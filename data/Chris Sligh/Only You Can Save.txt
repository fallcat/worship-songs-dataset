I saw a man today, his whole world across his back 
 A living monument opposed to my success 
 I tried to look into his eyes as he shuffled past my car 
 Sweat beading on his skin, his clothes and hair a mess 
 As the light turned green and I pulled away 
 He slowly disappeared 
 Just a memory of another chance 
 I failed to show Your love here 
 I wanna love because You loved 
 I wanna give because You gave 
 I wanna reach my hand out to the lost 
 'Cause I know Your hand will save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Have to wonder if I really want to know 
 The struggle and the pain that others feel 
 Do I want to hear the stories I see echoed in their eyes? 
 Or is this love I say that I'm reflecting even real? 
 As the light turns on inside my head 
 And I slowly disappear 
 I steel myself 'cause what You call for me 
 Is to show Your love here 
 I wanna love because You loved 
 I wanna give because You gave 
 I wanna reach my hand out to the lost 
 'Cause I know Your hand can save 
 I wanna love just like You loved 
 I wanna give just like You gave 
 I wanna reach your hand 
 'Cause only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 (Save) 
 Just let me be Your hands 
 (Only You can save) 
 Let me be Your eyes 
 (Only you can save) 
 Help me understand 
 (Only you can save) 
 That I'm Your hands and feet 
 Hidden behind this frail human disguise 
 I wanna love because You loved 
 I wanna give because You gave 
 I wanna reach my hand out to the lost 
 'Cause I know Your hand will save 
 I wanna love just like You loved 
 I wanna give just like You gave 
 I wanna reach your hand 
 'Cause only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save 
 Only You can save

Where did we go wrong? 
 That it's common place 
 For the world to think 
 We live to stand for hate 
 One too many picket sign 
 Has deflected one too many times 
 The fact that all our lives 
 Were simply meant to give away 
 Oh, whoa, we're all messed up 
 Oh, whoa, but isn't that the point of love? 
 We are, we are, we are all broken people 
 But we've been set free and loved, whoa 
 We are, we are, we are the chosen people 
 Forgiven much 
 So where's our love, our love, our love? 
 Where's our love, our love, our love? 
 We come into this mess 
 Sin upon our heads 
 Born equals in a race 
 That ends only with death 
 But we've been running in reverse 
 Since love conquered death's dark curse 
 Shouldn't we reflect His love 
 To a world hung by a thread? 
 Oh, whoa, we're all messed up 
 Oh, whoa, but isn't that the point of love? 
 We are, we are, we are all broken people 
 But we've been set free and loved, whoa 
 We are, we are, we are the chosen people 
 Forgiven much 
 So where's our love, our love, our love? 
 Where's our love, our love, our love? 
 Oh, whoa, we're all messed up 
 Oh, whoa, but isn't that the point of love? 
 We are, we are, we are all broken people 
 We've been set free and loved, whoa 
 We are, we are, we are the chosen people 
 Forgiven much 
 So where's our love, our love, our love? 
 Where's our love, our love, our love? 
 So reach out, there's someone you know 
 That has never seen God's love 
 Reach out, someone you love 
 Feels like they've never been enough 
 Reach out, the untouchables 
 The unreachables, the never thought of's 
 Reach out, they're in need, they're in need 
 They're in need, they're in need of our love 
 Our love, our love, our love 
 Reach out 
 Our love, our love, our love

We were young with hopes that last a lifetime 
 Burning dreams of anticipation 
 10 years on and we're still trying to figure out 
 What to be when we grow up 
 We're almost 30, still getting it together 
 Getting desperate, is this gonna take forever? 
 Oh, does everybody feel this way 
 Getting old but never growing up? 
 Oh, is there a destination waiting for me 
 Where I can finally meet, the man I'm meant to be? 
 We are young, with hopes that fade with ages 
 Life is full of empty pages 
 We're like a river, twisting and turning 
 But never finds the open sea 
 Oh, does everybody feel this way 
 Getting old but never growing up? 
 Oh, is there a destination waiting for me 
 Where I can finally meet, the man I'm meant to be? 
 Oh, I need someone to change me 
 I need someone to show me, where could I begin 
 Oh, I need someone to lead me 
 Hold my hand and take me, to where I've never been, oh 
 I'm getting desperate, is this gonna take forever? 
 Oh, does everybody feel this way 
 I'm getting old but never growing up? 
 Oh, is there a destination waiting for me 
 Where I can finally meet, the man I'm meant to be oh? 
 The man I'm meant to be 
 We were young with hopes that last a lifetime 
 Burning dreams of anticipation

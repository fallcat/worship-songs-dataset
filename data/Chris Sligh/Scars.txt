I want you to know, I want you know 
 That I'm weaker than I told you 
 Can I open my soul, can I open my soul 
 And let you in? 
 'Cause light only shines, yeah, light only shines 
 From the places where we're broken 
 And that's where we find, yeah, that's where we find 
 That grace begins 
 Oh, it's easy now to let it go 
 The only thing that's left to show 
 That love has healed our broken hearts 
 Is scars, yeah 
 There's nothing to prove, no, nothing to prove 
 You don't have to be somebody 
 You are who you are and even your scars 
 Are lovely 
 Oh, it's easy now to let it go 
 The only thing that's left to show 
 That love has healed our broken hearts 
 Is scars, yeah 
 The secrets that we're keeping from each other 
 The weaknesses we all want to hide 
 The places where we're falling all to pieces 
 The tears we cry 
 Oh, it's easy now to let it go 
 The only thing that's left to show 
 That love has healed our broken hearts 
 Is scars, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, oh, oh, yeah

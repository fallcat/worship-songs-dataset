There's something beautiful 
 About the way You don't make sense 
 A crown for a cross, heaven for earth 
 Beauty for ashes in the dirt 
 There's something marvelous 
 Some kind of mystery in Your grace 
 Love comes from pain, joy comes from loss 
 Still we find beauty in the cross 
 And hope from what was lost 
 Though I can't wrap my mind around the mysteries I'll be fine 
 There's something beautiful in all I can't see through 
 There's something wonderful 
 About the way You break my heart 
 This world for a cross, riches for shame 
 Trading this glory for Your name 
 And success for lovely gain 
 Though I can't wrap my mind around the mysteries I'll be fine 
 There's something beautiful in all I can't see through 
 Though I don't understand today the mysteries of grace I'll be okay 
 There's something beautiful in all I can't see through 
 Oh, something beautiful 
 Oh, something beautiful 
 Though I can't wrap my mind around the mysteries I'll be fine 
 There's something beautiful in all I can't see through 
 Though I don't understand today the mysteries of grace I'll be okay 
 There's something beautiful in all I can't see through 
 Oh, something beautiful 
 Oh, something beautiful

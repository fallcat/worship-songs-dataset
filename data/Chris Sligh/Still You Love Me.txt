You found me in my weakness 
 You, the epitome of strength 
 You found me in my darkness 
 You, the protector of the weak 
 You're standing right here with me 
 On the edge of letting go 
 Oh, I'm emptied out with nothing to offer 
 But still You love me 
 Whoa, my hands held out with nothing to offer 
 But still You love me 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, still You love me 
 You found me in my fear 
 You, the one who will not break 
 You found me in my doubting 
 Yeah, faithful You remain 
 You're stand right here with me 
 On the edge of all You've dreamed for me 
 Yeah, I'm emptied out with nothing to offer 
 But still You love me 
 Whoa, my hands held out with nothing to offer 
 But still You love me 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, still You love me 
 I can do nothing 
 I can do nothing without You, oh 
 I can do nothing 
 I can do nothing without You, oh 
 I'm emptied out with nothing to offer 
 But still You love me 
 Whoa, my hands held out with nothing to offer 
 But still You love me 
 Whoa, I'm emptied out with nothing to offer 
 (I can do nothing, I can do nothing) 
 But still You love me 
 (Without You, oh) 
 Whoa, my hands held out with nothing to offer 
 (I can do nothing, I can do nothing) 
 But still You love me 
 (Without You, oh) 
 Whoa, whoa 
 (I can do nothing, I can do nothing) 
 Whoa, but still You love me 
 (Without You, oh) 
 Whoa, whoa 
 (I can do nothing, I can do nothing) 
 Whoa, whoa 
 (Without You, oh)

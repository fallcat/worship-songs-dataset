You bring the wings and I'll bring the flight plan 
 'Cause you're an angel and I am just a man 
 But I've been a better man since you got here 
 And life is better too 'cause my world revolves around you 
 Clouds are gone and skies are blue 
 There's nothing to bring us down, whoa 
 Things are looking sunny, things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny since I found you 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Well, all of your skin looks good touching my skin 
 You're so pretty, I just fell in love again 
 It's love at each sight, over and over 
 My heels are over head, now it's me revolving round you 
 Clouds are gone and skies are blue 
 There's nothing to bring us down, whoa 
 Things are looking sunny, things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny since I found you 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Everything's bright, everything's clean 
 Everything's like my favorite dream 
 'Cause my favorite dream is you 
 The turn of your head, the flick of your wrist 
 Everything about you, you don't need a list to know 
 My favorite dream is you, you, you, you, yeah 
 Things are looking sunny 
 (My favorite dream is you) 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Clouds are gone and skies are blue 
 There's nothing to bring us down, whoa 
 Things are looking sunny, things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny since I found you 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny 
 Things are looking sunny

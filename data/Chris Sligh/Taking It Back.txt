Lately I've been feeling separated 
 Like I'm standing on the outside looking in 
 I can't believe how long I've waited 
 To feel like I'm a part of it again 
 I've been feeling like I'm having trouble feeling 
 What's been going on deep down 
 And every moment that been stealing 
 Is a moment that won't be coming back around 
 Don't know how I got here 
 But I'm so tired of giving in 
 I'm taking it back, I'm taking control of 
 The time I've wasted 
 I'm not going back this weary soul is 
 Tired of chasing myself, yeah, I'm taking it back 
 Lately I've been stuck on autopilot 
 Breathing just to breath, falling just to fall asleep 
 Maybe all that I can do is fight it off 
 And make a promise to myself that I can keep 
 Don't know how I got here 
 But I'm, I'm so tired of giving in 
 I'm taking it back, I'm taking control of 
 The time I've wasted 
 I'm not going back, this weary soul is 
 Tired of chasing myself, yeah, I'm taking it back 
 I'm taking it back 
 I'm taking it back, I'm taking control of 
 The time I've wasted 
 I'm not going back, this weary soul is 
 Tired of chasing myself 
 I'm taking it back, I'm taking control of 
 The time I've wasted 
 I'm not going back 'cause this weary soul is 
 Tired of chasing myself 
 I'm taking it back 
 I'm taking it back 
 I'm taking it back, yeah 
 I'm taking it back

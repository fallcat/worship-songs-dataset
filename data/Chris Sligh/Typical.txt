 Come on, can I dream for one day? 
 There's nothing that can't be done 
 But how long should it take somebody 
 Before they can be someone 
 'Cause I know there's got to be another level 
 Somewhere closer to the other side 
 And I'm feelin' like it's now or never 
 Can I break the spell of the typical? 
 Now I've lived through my share of misfortune 
 And I've worked in the blazing sun 
 But how long should it take somebody 
 Before they can be someone 
 'Cause I know there's got to be another level 
 Somewhere closer to the other side 
 And I'm feelin' like it's now or never 
 Can I break the spell of the typical? 
 I'm the typical 
 I'm the typical 
 Can I break the spell of the typical? 
 Because it's draggin' me down 
 Oh, I'd like to know about when 
 When does it all turn around? 
 Yeah I know there's got to be another level 
 Somewhere closer to the other side 
 And I'm feelin' like it's now or never 
 Can I break the spell of the typical? 
 Break the spell (of the typical) 
 Break the spell (of the typical) 
 Can I break the spell of the typical?

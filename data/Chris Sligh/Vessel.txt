Safe inside Your hand You hold me 
 Pain and tribulations mold me 
 I try to run away from You 
 The pain's too great You put me through 
 I find myself on my knees to pray 
 And then You hear the words You long for me to say 
 Make of me a vessel that You can always use 
 No matter how you break me, what I win or what I lose 
 Let me be a vessel pure and holy, perfect in Your eyes 
 Lord, hear me when I cry, for You to make me a vessel 
 Deep inside my heart You've shown me 
 Despite all my sins You've known me 
 I try to run away again 
 I break Your heart with all my sin 
 I fall to You with tear-filled eyes 
 I run to You with broken heart and cry 
 Make of me a vessel that You can always use 
 No matter how You break me, what I win or what I lose 
 Let me be a vessel pure and holy, perfect in Your eyes 
 Lord, hear me when I cry, for You to make me a vessel 
 Make me into what You want me to be 
 Oh Lord, may my prayer be, oh 
 Make of me a vessel that You can always use 
 No matter how You break me, what I win or what I lose 
 Let me be a vessel pure and holy, perfect in Your eyes 
 Lord, hear me when I cry, for You to make me 
 Oh Lord, make me a vessel

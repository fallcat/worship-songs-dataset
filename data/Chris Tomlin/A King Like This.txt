A King like this, majesty 
 Laying in a manger 
 A King like this 
 Unto us is born a Savior 
 The Light, the Light has come 
 A King like this, the highest 
 Name and the song of heaven 
 A King like this born of 
 Flesh into our suffering 
 The Light, the Light has come 
 He is Christ, the Lord 
 He is Christ, our Savior 
 I bow my heart before no other name 
 I bow my heart before no other King 
 A King like this, a saving 
 Love that would not forsake us 
 Betrayed by a kiss and led 
 To the cross for our forgiveness 
 The Light, the Light has come 
 He is Christ, the Lord 
 He is Christ, our Savior 
 I bow my heart before no other name 
 I bow my heart before no other King 
 We lift up our eyes, the 
 Light has come! 
 We lift up our eyes, the 
 Light has come! 
 We lift up our eyes, the 
 Light has come! 
 We lift up our eyes, 
 Lift up our eyes, 
 Lift up Your Eyes! 
 He is Christ, the Lord 
 He is Christ, our Savior 
 I bow my heart before no other name 
 I bow my heart before no other King 
 A King like this, a throne of grace 
 That will stand forever 
 The angels sing glory, glory, hallelujah 
 The Light, the Light has come 
 The Light, the Light has come

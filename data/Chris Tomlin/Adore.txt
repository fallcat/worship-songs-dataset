Ou stepped down from heaven 
 Humbly you came 
 God of all creation 
 Here with us 
 In a starlet manger 
 Emmanuel 
 Light of the world 
 Here to save 
 Adore 
 Come let us adore 
 Oh come let us adore him 
 The Lord, worship Christ, the Lord 
 Let all that is within us 
 Adore 
 Wise men bring their treasures 
 Shepherds bow low 
 Angel voices sing of peace on earth 
 What have I to offer 
 To heaven's King 
 I'll bring my life, my love, my all 
 Adore 
 Come let us adore 
 Oh come let us adore him 
 The Lord, worship Christ, the Lord 
 Let all that is within us 
 Adore 
 Angels sing, praises ring to the newborn King 
 Peace on earth, here with us, joy awakening 
 At your feet we fall 
 Adore 
 Come let us adore 
 Oh come let us adore him 
 The Lord, worship Christ, the Lord 
 Let all that is within us 
 Adore

You're arriving with the sound of thunder and rain 
 You're arriving in the calm of the wind and the waves 
 You're arriving in the glow of a burning flame 
 A burning flame 
 Praise awaits You at the dawn when the world comes alive 
 Praise awaits You in the darkness and shines in the light 
 Praise awaits You with a song of love and desire, love and desire 
 Here comes the King 
 All bow down 
 Lift up your voices 
 Unto the Lamb 
 He is the King 
 All bow down 
 All bow down 
 You are coming again like a thief in the night 
 You are coming again with a shout from the sky 
 You are coming again to take away Your bride 
 To take away Your bride 
 Here comes the King 
 All bow down 
 Lift up your voices 
 Unto the Lamb 
 He is the King 
 All bow down 
 All bow down 
 Yeah, You are the King 
 Yeah, You are the King 
 You are the King 
 All bow down 
 We lift up our voices 
 Unto the Lamb 
 You are the King 
 All bow down 
 All bow down 
 You are the King 
 All bow down 
 We lift up our voices 
 Unto the Lamb 
 You are the King 
 All bow down 
 All bow down

This dry and desert land 
 I tell myself, "Keep walking on" 
 Hear something up ahead 
 Water falling like a song 
 An everlasting stream 
 Your river carries me home 
 Let it flow, let if flow 
 A flood for my soul 
 A well that never will run dry 
 I've rambled on my own 
 Never believing I would find 
 An everlasting stream 
 Your river carries me home 
 Let it flow, let it flow 
 Open the heavens, come, living water 
 All my fountains are in You 
 You're strong like a river 
 Your love is running through 
 All my fountains are in You 
 Come on and rain down on us 
 Rain down on us, Lord

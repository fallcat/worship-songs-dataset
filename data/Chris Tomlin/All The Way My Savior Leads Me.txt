All the way my Savior leads me 
 Who have I to ask beside 
 How could I doubt His tender mercy 
 Who through life has been my guide 
 All the way my Savior leads me 
 Cheers each winding path I tread 
 Gives me grace for every trial 
 Feeds me with the living Bread 
 You lead me and keep me from falling 
 You carry me close to Your heart 
 And surely Your goodness and mercy will follow me 
 All the way my Savior leads me 
 O, the fullness of His love 
 O, the sureness of His promise 
 In the triumph of His blood 
 And when my spirit clothed immortal 
 Wings its flight to realms of day 
 This is my song through endless ages 
 Jesus led me all the way 
 Jesus led me all the way 
 You lead me and keep me from falling 
 You carry me close to Your heart 
 And surely Your goodness and mercy will follow me 
 You lead me and keep me from falling 
 You carry me close to Your heart 
 And surely Your goodness and mercy will follow me 
 Will follow me 
 All the way my Savior leads me 
 All the way my Savior leads me

You set the boundaries for the oceans 
 You command the wind and the waves 
 Standing over every season 
 God You reign, You reign 
 It's all Yours 
 The day and the night, the earth and the sky 
 God it's all Yours 
 Every breath we're taking in 
 We pour out again in worship 
 God You authored our beginning 
 You have numbered all our days 
 Your love for us is everlasting 
 Beyond the grave, You reign 
 It's all Yours 
 The day and the night, the earth and the sky 
 God it's all Yours 
 Every breath we're taking in 
 We pour out again in worship 
 The moutains rise and lift Your name 
 The oceans roar and shout Your praise 
 Everything is yours! 
 It's all Yours 
 The day and the night, the earth and the sky 
 God it's all Yours 
 Every breath we're taking in 
 We pour out again in worship

You have no rival 
 You stand alone 
 The heavens worship before Your throne 
 There is no one like You 
 You have no equal 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 Yours is the highest of every name 
 There is no one like You 
 Almighty 
 We're standing in the presence of Your majesty 
 Your holy 
 You alone the sovereign crown of royalty 
 You're the King of Kings 
 Almighty 
 Our God eternal the great I am 
 The praise of angels will never end 
 There is no one like You 
 Eyes like fire 
 Face like the sun 
 A voice like thunder 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 I see the holy one, high and exalted 
 I hide my eyes and I tremble before Him 
 I tremble before Him 
 I see the holy one high and exalted 
 I hide my eyes and I tremble before Him 
 I tremble, You are

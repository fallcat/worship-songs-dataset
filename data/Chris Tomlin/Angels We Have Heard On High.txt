Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains, 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains. 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 What the gladsome tidings be 
 Which inspire your heavenly song? 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Come on - spoken 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 Him whose birth the angels sing; 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ the Lord, the newborn King. 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, (gloria) in excelsis Deo

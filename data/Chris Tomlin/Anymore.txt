Should have known this 
 They say that I'm from Mars and you're from Venus 
 But I tried it anyway 
 Who am I to think I can understand your brain 
 That's insane 
 I guess I love you 
 That's the only explanation for what I do 
 When you are around 
 Girl, I get so crazy when I look into your eyes 
 Makes me think that I am gonna take you 
 Right down to the station 
 Where I'll buy you 
 A one-way ticket out of town 
 Then I'll send you 
 A postcard from the farthest place from there 
 And I'll sign it "I'm so glad that you ain't here" 
 And then I'll build you a big old ugly statue 
 Of my new girlfriend 
 The one I left you for 
 Then I'll send it 
 C.O.D. express mail to your door 
 That's exactly what I'll do 
 As soon as I don't love you anymore 
 That's for sure 
 I've got this theory 
 That the women of the world 
 Are out to get me 
 And I know of one who tried 
 She seemed to think I could be her friend for life 
 Girl, think twice 
 'Cause friends don't kiss me 
 And they pay for their own ticket at the movie 
 So I hope you brought some cash 
 And you and all your other friends 
 Can do what you want to 
 But girl I think we're through 
 I guess I'll drive you 
 Way out in the country 
 Where I'll leave you 
 With nothing but your clothes 
 Then I'll watch you 
 Get smaller in the mirror as I drive 
 And I pray to God that you'll survive 
 So you can see me 
 On every single station of your TV 
 Singing about you 
 And making money 
 Just think of all the things I could afford 
 Well, I won't spend a nickel on you 
 'Cause I don't think I'll love you anymore 
 You might think that I sound angry 
 (But girls have driven him so crazy) 
 I won't be held accountable 
 (He can't be held responsible) 
 For what I'm about to do to you 
 I think I'll take you 
 Right down to the station 
 Where I'll buy you 
 A one-way ticket out of town 
 Then I'll send you 
 A postcard from the farthest place from there 
 And I'll sign it "I'm so glad that you ain't here" 
 And then I'll build you a big old ugly statue 
 Of my new girlfriend 
 The one I left you for 
 Then I'll send it 
 C.O.D. express mail to your door 
 That's exactly what I'll do 
 As soon as I don't love you anymore 
 I guess I'll drive you 
 Way out in the country 
 Where I'll leave you 
 With nothing but your clothes 
 Then I'll watch you 
 Get smaller in the mirror as I drive 
 And I pray to God that you'll survive 
 So you can see me 
 On every single station of your TV 
 Singing about you 
 And making money 
 Just think of all the things I could afford 
 I won't spend a nickel on you 
 'Cause I don't think I'll love you anymore 
 Yeah that's exactly what I'll do 
 As soon as I don't love you... anymore

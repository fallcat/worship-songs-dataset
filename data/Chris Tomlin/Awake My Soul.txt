Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me 
 Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me 
 I come alive, I'm alive when You breathe on me 
 I come alive, I'm alive when You breathe on me 
 Awake, awake, awake my soul 
 God resurrect these bones 
 From death to life, for You alone 
 Awake my soul 
 Speak to me, word of God, speak to me 
 Speak to me, word of God, speak to me 
 I come alive, I'm alive when You speak to me 
 I come alive, I'm alive when You speak to me 
 Awake, awake, awake my soul 
 God resurrect these bones 
 From death to life, for You alone 
 Awake my soul 
 And then He said to me, 
 "Prophesy to these bones and say to them, 
 Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! 
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones, 
 I will make breath into you, 
 And you will come to life." 
 So I prophesied as I was commanded. 
 As I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, 
 And the bones came together, bone to bone. 
 And I looked, and tendons and the flesh appeared on them, 
 And skin covered them, but there was no breath in them. 
 And then He said to me, 
 "Prophesy to the breath, 
 Prophesy, son of man, and say to it, 
 Come from the four winds, oh breath, and breathe." 
 Awake, awake, awake my soul 
 God resurrect these bones 
 From death to life, for You alone 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake, awake, awake my soul 
 God resurrect these bones 
 From death to life, for You alone 
 Awake my soul 
 Yeah, I'm not alone, I realize 
 I breathe out, I come alive 
 Your word gives life to my dry bones 
 Your breath tells death it can ride on. 
 Awake me, make me a living stone, 
 A testament to Your throne, I 
 I'm nothing without You, I'm on my own 
 The only one who satisfies my soul

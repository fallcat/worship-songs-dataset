In our hearts Lord, in this nation 
 Awakening 
 Holy Spirit we desire 
 Awakening 
 For You and You alone 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 For the world You love 
 Your will be done 
 Let Your will be done in me 
 In Your presence, in Your power 
 Awakening 
 For this moment, for this hour 
 Awakening 
 For You and You alone 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 For the world You love 
 Your will be done 
 Let Your will be done in me 
 For You and You alone 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 For the world You love 
 Your will be done 
 Let Your will be done in me 
 Like the rising sun that shines 
 From the darkness comes a light 
 I hear Your voice 
 And this is my awakening 
 Like the rising sun that shines 
 From the darkness comes a light 
 I hear Your voice 
 And this is my awakening 
 Awake my soul 
 Like the rising sun that shines 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 From the darkness comes a light 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 Like the rising sun that shines 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 Only You can raise a life 
 Awake my soul 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 In our hearts Lord, in the nations 
 Awakening

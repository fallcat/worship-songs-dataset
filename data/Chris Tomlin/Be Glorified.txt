Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 Your love has captured me 
 Your grace has set me free 
 Your life the air I breathe 
 Be glorified in me 
 Your love has captured me 
 Your grace has set me free 
 Your life the air I breathe 
 Be glorified in me 
 You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire 
 In the presence of a thousand kings, You are my one desire 
 And I stand before You now with trembling hands lifted high 
 Be glorified 
 Be glorified 
 Your love has captured me 
 Your grace has set me free 
 Your life the air I breathe 
 Be glorified in me 
 You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire 
 In the presence of a thousand kings, You are my one desire 
 And I stand before You now with trembling hands lifted high 
 Be lifted high 
 You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire 
 In the presence of a thousand kings, You are my one desire 
 And I stand before You now with trembling hands lifted high 
 Be glorified 
 Be glorified in me, be glorified in me 
 Be glorified in me, be glorified 
 You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire 
 In the presence of a thousand kings, You are my one desire 
 And I stand before You now with trembling hands lifted high 
 Lifted high 
 Lifted high 
 You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire 
 In the presence of a thousand kings, You are my one desire 
 And I stand before You now with trembling hands lifted high 
 Be glorified, be glorified 
 Be glorified

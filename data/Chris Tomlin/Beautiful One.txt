Wonderful so wonderful is your unfailing love 
 Your cross is spoken mercy over me 
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no heart can fully know 
 How glorious, how beautiful you are 
 Beautiful one I love you 
 Beautiful one I adore 
 Beautiful one my soul must sing 
 Powerful so powerful your glory fills the skies 
 Your mighty works displayed for all to see 
 The beauty of your majesty awakes my heart to sing 
 How marvelous, how wonderful you are 
 You've opened my eyes to your wonders anew 
 Captured my heart with this love 
 'Cause nothing on this earth is as beautiful as you 
 My soul my soul must sing 
 My soul my soul must sing 
 My soul my soul must sing 
 Beautiful one

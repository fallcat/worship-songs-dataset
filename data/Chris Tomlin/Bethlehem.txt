Starlight in a mother's eyes 
 A Holy Child is born 
 Kings and shepherds on their knees 
 Adoring Christ the Lord 
 Bethlehem Bethlehem 
 Behold Your beautiful Savior! 
 Fall down, worship Him 
 The King born in Bethlehem 
 He knew the secrets of the world 
 His lips could not yet speak 
 Heaven wrapped in flesh and blood 
 The Son of Majesty 
 Bethlehem Bethlehem 
 Behold Your beautiful Savior! 
 Fall down, worship Him 
 The King born in Bethlehem 
 Fall down, worship 
 The Hope of Israel 
 Come and adore Him 
 Jesus, Emmanuel! 
 Bethlehem Bethlehem 
 Behold Your beautiful Savior! 
 Fall down, worship Him 
 The King born in Bethlehem 
 O little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above the deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting Light 
 The hopes and fears of 
 All the years are met 
 In thee tonight

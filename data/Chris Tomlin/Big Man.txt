I saw him crying just the other day 
 He watched his dog get split by a big old freight train 
 And he remembered all those times in the park 
 When him and Snoopy would sit lying in the dark 
 He watched the girls go by 
 And Snoopy did the same 
 But now it's over all because of that old freight train 
 It takes a big man to cry 
 But a bigger man to laugh at him 
 I takes a big man to cry 
 So everybody sigh 
 For that big man who cries 
 Ooh ooh, ah ah 
 I saw him crying just the other day 
 Jimbo said Suzie told him to go away 
 She said you're worthless and you won't amount to much 
 And every time we kiss I vomit up my lunch 
 It takes a big man to cry 
 But a bigger man to laugh at him 
 I takes a big man to cry 
 So everybody sigh 
 For that big man who cries 
 Just remember when you see somebody crying 
 And you want to ease their pain 
 Just laugh and go away 
 It takes a big man to cry 
 But a bigger man to laugh at him 
 I takes a big man to cry 
 So everybody sigh 
 For that big man who cries

No reputation, no stately bearing 
 No palace bed for royalty 
 But a star in the Heavens 
 A sign full of wonder 
 Announcing the coming of the King of kings 
 Rejoice! O, world 
 Your Savior has come 
 Through the love of a virgin's womb 
 Son of God, Son of Man 
 Born that we may have life 
 You were born that we may have life 
 A throne in a manger, the cross in a cradle 
 The hidden revealing this glorious plan 
 Of a child who would suffer 
 A child who would conquer 
 The sin of every woman, the sin of every man 
 Rejoice! O, world 
 Your Savior has come 
 Through the love of a virgin's womb 
 Son of God, Son of Man 
 Born that we may have life 
 You were born that we may have life 
 Rejoice! O, world 
 Your Savior has come 
 Through the love of a virgin's womb 
 Son of God, Son of Man 
 You were Born that we may have life 
 Rejoice! O, world 
 Your Savior has come 
 Through the love of a virgin's womb (it was all about love) 
 Son of God, Son of Man 
 Born that we may have life 
 You were born that we may have life 
 You were born that we may have life 
 You were born that we may have life 
 Rejoice! O, world, rejoice!  Yeah 
 Rejoice! O, world, hallelujah, the Savior has come, yeah 
 Rejoice! O, world, join with the angels 
 Rejoice! O, world, rejoice!  Yeah 
 Rejoice! O, world, for the King of kings 
 And the Lord of lords, oh yeah 
 Rejoice! O, world, a Savior is born 
 Who brings us life and brings peace, oh yeah 
 Born that we may have life 
 You were born that we may have life (we may have life) 
 You were born that we may have life

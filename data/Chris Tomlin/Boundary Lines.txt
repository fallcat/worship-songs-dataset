I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 The boundary lines have fallen in welcome places 
 The Lord is my defender and my shield 
 I will keep my eyes always, always 
 Set on You 
 Forever You're my joy 
 My heart is a cup 
 Your love is an ocean 
 You fill me up like rivers overflowing 
 My heart is a cup 
 Your love is an ocean 
 You fill me up like rivers overflowing 
 The boundary lines have fallen in welcome places 
 The Lord is my defender and my shield 
 I will keep my eyes always, always 
 Set on You 
 Forever You're my joy 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 My heart is a cup 
 Your love is an ocean 
 You fill me up like rivers overflowing 
 My heart is a cup 
 Your love is an ocean 
 You fill me up like rivers overflowing 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love 
 I cannot contain this love

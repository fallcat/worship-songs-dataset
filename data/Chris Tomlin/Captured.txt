I heard your echo in the canyon 
 Upon the timberline 
 You said these mountains were your invention 
 And so was this heart of mine 
 I heard you whisper on the water, 
 There on the mighty sea 
 You spoke of love deep as the ocean 
 When You spoke of Your love for me 
 I am loved by the Father 
 I am loved by the Son 
 It is love that has captured 
 The heart of this wayward one 
 I heard your laughter in the sunrise, 
 Amidst the morning birds 
 A song of freedom for all creation 
 And you sang me every word 
 I heard you singing in the silence, 
 A simple melody 
 Words of love, O I can hear it 
 My Father is very fond of me

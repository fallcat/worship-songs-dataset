The word of the profits centuries old 
 The birth of Messiah has been long foretold 
 Now unto you 
 Now unto you 
 Christ is come! 
 Let all creation see God's own son 
 Oh hail the new born king 
 The Word made flesh now dwells among us 
 Christ is Come 
 Those born in darkness have seen the great light 
 The Redeemer of our hearts has been born this night 
 Prince of peace, Yeshua, Messiah, Son of Man 
 Holy One, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Great I Am 
 Comforter, Counselor, Author and Finisher 
 Divine truth, Reveler, Deliver Healer, 
 You Are God, Jesus You are God

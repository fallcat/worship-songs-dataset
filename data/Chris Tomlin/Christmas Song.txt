Well I was sitting in my sleigh one day in December 
 Thinking to myself man, I should have been a singer 
 There's got to be more then playing Santa at the mall 
 And all these crying kids were driving me up the wall 
 Well, the day was almost done but there was still a long line 
 And my legs were getting sore from two or three at a time 
 When you stepped up and my heart took a blow 
 And my mind started thanking ho, ho, ho 
 Sit on my knee 
 Tell me you want me for Christmas 
 Snuggle up and whisper in my ear 
 Baby, I'm one gift I know I can deliver...

Oh, heart of mine 
 Why must you stray 
 From one so fair 
 You run away 
 And one more time you have to pay 
 The heaviness of needless shame 
 Oh, heart of mine 
 Come back home 
 You've been too long 
 Out on your own 
 And He's been there all along 
 Watching for you down the road 
 So come home running 
 His arms are open wide 
 His name is Jesus 
 And He understands 
 He is the answer 
 You are looking for 
 So come home running 
 Just as you are 
 Oh, child of God 
 So dearly loved 
 And ransomed by 
 The Savior's blood 
 And called by name daughter and son 
 Wrapped in the robe of righteousness 
 So come home running 
 His arms are open wide 
 His name is Jesus 
 And He understands 
 He is the answer 
 You are looking for 
 So come home running 
 Just as you are 
 Come home running 
 His arms are open wide 
 His name is Jesus 
 And He understands 
 He is the answer 
 You are looking for 
 So come home running 
 Just as you are 
 Just as you are

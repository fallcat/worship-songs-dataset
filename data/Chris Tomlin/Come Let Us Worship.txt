Come, let us worship and bow down 
 Before the Lord Most Holy 
 Before the King of Glory 
 Come and lay your burdens down 
 Before the Friend who's faithful 
 Before the One who's able 
 For He is our God 
 And we are His people 
 He is our God 
 And we will never be forsaken 
 Come, let us lift our voice in praise 
 Unto the Rock of Ages 
 Unto the God who saves us 
 Come and glorify His name 
 All the earth together 
 All the saints forever 
 For He is our God 
 And we are His people 
 Yes, He is our God 
 And we will never be forsaken 
 You are our God 
 And we are Your people 
 Yes, You are our God 
 And we will be with You 
 Yes, You are our God 
 And we will be with You Forever 
 Forever

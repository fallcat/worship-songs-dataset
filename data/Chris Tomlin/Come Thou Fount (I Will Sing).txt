Come Thou fount of every blessing 
 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace 
 Streams of mercy never ceasing 
 Call for songs of loudest praise 
 Teach me some melodious sonnet 
 Sung by flaming tongues above 
 Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it 
 Mount of Thy redeeming love 
 Here I raise my Ebenezer 
 Hither by Thy help I come 
 And I hope by Thy good pleasure 
 Safely to arrive at home 
 Jesus sought me when a stranger 
 Wandering from the fold of God 
 He to rescue me from danger 
 Interposed His precious blood 
 How Your kindness yet pursues me 
 How Your mercy never fails me 
 Till the day that death shall loose me 
 I will sing, oh I will sing 
 Turnaround 
 Oh to grace how great a debtor 
 Daily I'm constrained to be 
 Let Thy goodness like a fetter 
 Bind my wandering heart to Thee 
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it 
 Prone to leave the God I love 
 Here's my heart Lord, take and seal it 
 Seal it for Thy courts above 
 How Your kindness yet pursues me 
 How Your mercy never fails me 
 Till the day that death shall loose me 
 I will sing, oh I will sing 
 How Your kindness yet pursues me 
 How Your mercy never fails me 
 Till the day that death shall loose me 
 I will sing, oh I will sing 
 Till the day that death shall loose me 
 I will sing, oh I will sing 
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it 
 Prone to leave the God I love 
 Here's my heart Lord, take and seal it 
 Seal it for Thy courts above 
 Here's my heart Lord, take and seal it 
 Seal it for Thy courts above

Come, thou long expected Jesus, 
 Born to set Thy people free; 
 From our fears and sins release us; 
 Let us find our rest in Thee. 
 Israel's Strength and Consolation, 
 Hope of all the Earth Thou art; 
 Dear Desire of every nation, 
 Joy of every longing heart. 
 Born Thy people to deliver, 
 Born a child and yet a King, 
 Born to reign in us forever, 
 Now Thy gracious kingdom bring. 
 By Thine own eternal Spirit 
 Rule in all our hearts alone; 
 By Thine own all sufficient merit, 
 Raise us to Thy glorious throne. 
 By Thine own all sufficient - spoken 
 By Thine own all sufficient merit, 
 Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

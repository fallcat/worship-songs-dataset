Come to the water 
 There's a war going on just across the street 
 There's a rage that's burning to an angry beat 
 I can feel the thirst but there's no relief 
 We need a river 
 There's a sound in the distance like a thunder cloud 
 Waiting for the rain while the sun beats down 
 Can you feel it rising from the underground? 
 We need a river 
 Oh, let justice roll like rivers 
 Oh, let mercy flow with love, love 
 Come to the water, come to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 Come to the water, run to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 There's a cry from a child in the factory 
 There's a prayer for the prisoners of poverty 
 Save us from the greed and the apathy 
 We need a river 
 There's a hope like a flood running down our street 
 We're an army of peacemakers on our feet 
 Take us to the place where love and mercy meet 
 There is a river 
 Oh, let justice roll like rivers 
 Oh, let mercy flow with love, love 
 Come to the water, come to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 Come to the water, run to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 Father forgive us for the preaching the gospel 
 That we don't always show 
 While millions all over this planet are dying of spiritual thirst 
 We're greedy and selfish in our ways 
 But Father I heard You say that if my people 
 Who are called by Your name 
 Will humble themselves and pray 
 You will hear our prayers and give us water that will satisfy, sing 
 Come to the water, come to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 Come to the water, run to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 Come to the water, come to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 Come to the water, run to the water of life 
 It will never run dry 
 It will never run dry 
 We're thirsty Father, come on

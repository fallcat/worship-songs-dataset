You reign in endless power 
 Above the world You made 
 Across the sky is written 
 Your majesty and praise 
 And still You move in mercy 
 And hear the humble heart 
 For every soul that's searching, 
 Jesus there You are 
 Your beauty fills the sky 
 Your glory reigns in brilliant light 
 Great God of countless wonders 
 I will lift my eyes 
 The mysteries of heaven 
 And all Your works displayed 
 Every star, every ocean, 
 The universe proclaims 
 For every sun that rises, 
 Your faithfulness to me 
 Like the changing of the seasons, 
 Like the river to the sea 
 Your beauty fills the sky 
 Your glory reigns in brilliant light 
 Great God of countless wonders 
 I will lift my eyes 
 No one can fathom all Your mighty works O God 
 Just one glimpse of You and I am overcome 
 You open up Your hand and pour out once again 
 Your everlasting love 
 Your beauty fills the sky 
 Your glory reigns in brilliant light 
 Great God of countless wonders 
 I will lift my eyes [repeat]

Crown Him with many crowns 
 The Lamb upon His throne 
 Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns 
 All music but it's own 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 Of Him who died for me 
 And hail Him as thy matchless King 
 Through all eternity 
 Majesty, Lord of all 
 Let every throne, before Him fall 
 The King of Kings, oh come adore 
 Our God who reigns forevermore 
 Crown Him the Lord of life 
 Who triumphed o'er the grave 
 And rose victorious in the strife 
 For those He came to save 
 His glories now we sing 
 Who died and rose on high 
 Who died eternal life to bring 
 And lives that death may die 
 Majesty, Lord of all 
 Let every throne, before Him fall 
 The King of Kings, oh come adore 
 Our God who reigns forevermore 
 Forevermore! 
 All hail Redeemer hail 
 For He has died for me 
 His praise and glory shall not fail 
 Throughout eternity 
 All hail Redeemer hail 
 For He has died for me 
 His praise and glory shall not fail 
 Throughout eternity 
 Majesty, Lord of all 
 Let every throne, before Him fall 
 The King of Kings, oh come adore 
 Our God who reigns forevermore 
 Majesty, Lord of all 
 Let every throne, before Him fall 
 The King of Kings, oh come adore 
 Our God who reigns forevermore 
 Praise God who reigns forevermore 
 You're the God who reigns forevermore

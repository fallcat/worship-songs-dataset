What hope we hold this starlit night 
 A King is born in Bethlehem 
 Our journey long, we seek the light 
 That leads to the hallowed manger ground 
 What fear we felt in the silent age 
 400 years, can He be found 
 But broken by a baby's cry 
 Rejoice in the hallowed manger ground 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 God incarnate here to dwell 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 Praise His name, Emmanuel 
 The Son of God here born to bleed 
 A crown of thorns would pierce His brow 
 And we beheld this offering 
 Exalted now the King of kings 
 Praise God for the hallowed manger ground 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 God incarnate here to dwell 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 Praise His name, Emmanuel 
 Oh, praise His name Emmanuel 
 Oh, praise His name Emmanuel

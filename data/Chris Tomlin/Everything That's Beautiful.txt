With rain, with sun 
 With much, with less 
 With joy, with pain 
 With life, with death 
 The only things that satisfy come from You 
 They come from You 
 Everything that's beautiful 
 Everything that's wonderful 
 Every perfect gift comes from You 
 Your grace, Your heart 
 Your voice, Your touch 
 Your word, Your peace 
 Your hope, Your love 
 The only things that satisfy come from you 
 They come from You 
 Everything that's beautiful 
 Everything that's wonderful 
 Every perfect gift comes from You 
 A thousand words could not explain 
 A thousand worlds could not contain 
 Every perfect gift comes from You 
 It comes from the Father of Lights 
 It comes from the Giver of Life 
 It comes from the Heavens above 
 It's coming straight from Your heart 
 To the people You love 
 From the Father of Lights 
 From the Giver of Life 
 From the Heavens above 
 It's coming straight from Your heart 
 To the people You love 
 A thousand words 
 Everything that's beautiful 
 A thousand words 
 Everything that's wonderful 
 A thousand words 
 Everything

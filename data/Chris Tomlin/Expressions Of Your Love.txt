A symphony of color 
 Painted on a western sky 
 The thunder roars and the rain it falls 
 Over fields, over streams, over us, You're 
 Over us... 
 Expressions of Your glory 
 Expressions of Your heart 
 In all You are 
 You speak to us 
 Expressions of Your love 
 A message sent from Heaven 
 Walked among us as a man 
 The Son of God and Light of the world 
 Love divine, crucified, (and) made alive, 
 You're alive... 
 Oh Jesus make me 
 An expression of You

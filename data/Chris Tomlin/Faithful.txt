 Father to the fatherless 
 You uphold the one who feels forsaken 
 You are faithful, God

 God, You reign forever and Your love will endure 
 Faithful And True is the name of the Lord 
 You are faithful, God

 You are faithful, God 
 And I will sing to the Maker of heaven and earth 
 God, You reign forever and Your love will endure 
 Faithful And True is the name of the Lord 
 You are faithful, God

 In every season of my soul 
 You are there 
 You're the anchor that will hold 
 You are there 
 In the valley of the shadows 
 You are faithful, God 
 You are there 
 In every season of my soul 
 You are there 
 You're the anchor that will hold 
 You are there 
 In the valley of the shadows 
 You are faithful, God 
 And I will sing to the Maker of heaven and earth 
 God, You reign forever and Your love will endure 
 Faithful And True is the name of the Lord 
 You are faithful, God 
 Yes, You are 
 You are faithful, God

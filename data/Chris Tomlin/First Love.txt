You are still my first love 
 And all I am is Yours 
 You are still my anchor 
 Forever I'm secure 
 You are still my first love 
 You're my guiding light 
 You're with me in the fire 
 And You lead me through the night 
 You have my heart 
 You've won my heart 
 Oh how I love You, Je-sus 
 You are my greatest joy 
 How I adore You, Je-sus 
 Oh, my soul rejoice 
 You are still my first love 
 And all I'm longing for 
 You'll always be the fortress 
 My shelter in the storm 
 You have my heart 
 You've won my heart 
 Oh how I love You, Je-sus 
 You are my greatest joy 
 How I adore You, Je-sus 
 Oh, my soul rejoice 
 Oh how I love You, Je-sus 
 You are my greatest joy 
 How I adore You, Je-sus 
 Oh, my soul rejoice 
 Oh, my soul rejoice

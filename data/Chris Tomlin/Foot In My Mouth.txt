I saw mrs. Parker at the store today, 
 She was buyin' some food 
 I walked up to her and I said "hey!" 
 When's the baby due? 
 She said "baby?" 
 I'm not having a baby, 
 What you talkin' about? 
 I said "sorry... mrs. parker" 
 I put my foot in my mouth 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 Guess I should watch what I say, 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 It's prob'ly better that way 
 I took my brother to the mall last christmas, 
 To see Santa and his sleigh, 
 I said "aren't you glad that you're old enough," 
 To know that santa is fake? 
 He said "fake? Santa's not fake!" 
 What you talkin' about? 
 I said "no, I didn't tell ya Santa was fake!" 
 I said... Santa's great... 
 I put my foot in my mouth 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 Guess I should watch what I say, 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 It's prob'ly better that way 
 Here's the last verse 
 I was braggin' to a friend of mine 
 How I ran over this cat, 
 I said "his name was fluffy, 'cause I read the tag..." 
 Right after I squashed him flat 
 She said "fluffy? my cat's name is fluffy! he was my best friend." 
 I said "no, I didn't say his name was fluffy!" 
 I said his name was... twinkles 
 Here I go again... 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 Guess I should watch what I say, 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 It's prob'ly better that way 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 Guess I should watch what I say, 
 I got my foot in my mouth, 
 It's prob'ly better that way

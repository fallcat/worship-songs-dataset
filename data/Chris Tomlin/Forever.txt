 Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good. 
 Give thanks to the God of gods. 
 Give thanks to the Lord of lords: 
 To Him who alone does great wonders, 
 Who by His understanding made the heavens, 
 Who spread out the earth upon the waters, 
 Who made the great lightsâ€” 
 To the One who remembered us in our low estate 
 And freed us from our enemies, 
 And who gives food to every creature. 
 Give thanks to the God of heaven. 
 His love endures forever.

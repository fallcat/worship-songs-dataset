There's a song that's on my lips 
 From the moment that I rise 
 To the One who rescued me 
 And brought me life 
 Praise awaits You at the dawn 
 Praise awaits You in the night 
 With the heavens I will sing 
 And lift You high 
 Glory be to God the Father 
 Glory be to God the Son 
 Glory be to God the Spirit 
 All glory to the One 
 Glory to the Lord Almighty 
 Glory to the King Most High 
 Glory be to God forever 
 All glory to the One Turnaround 
 Praise awaits You at the dawn 
 Praise awaits You in the night 
 With the heavens I will sing 
 And lift You high 
 Glory be to God the Father 
 Glory be to God the Son 
 Glory be to God the Spirit 
 All glory to the One 
 Glory to the Lord Almighty 
 Glory to the King Most High 
 Glory be to God forever 
 All glory to the One Turnaround 
 As it was, and is and ever shall be amen, amen 
 As it was, and is and ever shall be amen, amen 
 As it was, and is and ever shall be amen, amen 
 As it was, and is and ever shall be amen, amen 
 Glory be to God! 
 Glory be to God the Father 
 Glory be to God the Son 
 Glory be to God the Spirit 
 All glory to the One 
 Glory to the Lord Almighty 
 Glory to the King Most High 
 Glory be to God forever 
 All glory to the One Turnaround 
 Glory be to God!

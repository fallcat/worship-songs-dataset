Like the waters roar 
 Is Your voice, O Lord 
 There is none before 
 And none beside 
 You are set apart 
 You alone are God 
 Your glory reaches far 
 From sky to sky 
 Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty 
 Early in the morning we will sing 
 Holy, Holy, we bow down before Thee 
 All Your children love to sing Your name 
 God Almighty 
 You're the breath of life 
 You're the God on high 
 Your song shall rise 
 And never pass away 
 O, Your Majesty 
 Evermore shall be 
 The earth, the skies, the sea 
 Shall bring You praise 
 Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty 
 Early in the morning we will sing 
 You are Holy, Holy, we bow down before Thee 
 All Your children love to sing Your name 
 God Almighty 
 God Almighty 
 And I hide my eyes 
 With my face to the ground 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 And I clap my hands 
 And I lay my crowns 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 And I hide my eyes 
 With my face to the ground 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 And I clap my hands 
 And I lay my crowns 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 And I hide my eyes 
 With my face to the ground 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 And I clap my hands 
 And I lay my crowns 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 You are Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty 
 Early in the morning we will sing 
 You are Holy, Holy, we bow down before Thee 
 All Your children love to sing Your name 
 God Almighty 
 God Almighty

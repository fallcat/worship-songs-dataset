One Church, one Faith, one anthem raised 
 God and God alone 
 One cross, one grace, one name that saves us all 
 All praise to You belongs 
 All praise to You belongs 
 We lift You higher, higher, God and God alone 
 Your name be louder, louder than any other song 
 You are forever seated on Your throne 
 You are forever God and God alone 
 Who else can wash our sin away? 
 God and God alone 
 Who else can raise us from the grave? 
 All praise to You belongs 
 Jesus, all praise to You belongs 
 We lift You higher, higher, God and God alone 
 Your name be louder, louder than any other song 
 You are forever seated on Your throne 
 You are forever God and God alone 
 And what could separate us 
 From this amazing love? 
 What could say it's greater than our God? 
 Every knee will bow down, oh 
 And what could separate us 
 From this amazing love? 
 What could say it's greater than our God? 
 Every knee will bow down 
 Every knee will bow down 
 We lift You higher, higher, God and God alone 
 Your name be louder, louder than any other song 
 You are forever seated on Your throne 
 You are forever seated on Your throne 
 You are forever God and God alone 
 You are forever God and God alone 
 And what could separate us from this amazing love? 
 What could say it's greater than our God? 
 Every knee will bow down 
 What could separate us from this amazing love? 
 What could say it's greater than our God? 
 Every knee will bow down 
 Oh, every knee will bow down 
 Yes, every knee will bow down 
 Oh, every knee will bow down

On the hill of Calvary 
 The Light of all the world 
 With the world on His shoulders 
 The weight of all our shame 
 On Him who knew no sin 
 A Holy surrender 
 The sky went dark 
 The Angels wept 
 The Father looked away 
 The final breath 
 He bowed His head 
 The lamb of God was slain 
 By His wounds I am set free 
 By His blood I've been redeemed 
 The great divide He crossed for me 
 Oh, praise the God of Calvary 
 On the hill of Calvary 
 Into the Father's hands 
 A Holy surrender 
 A borrowed tomb 
 His mother wept 
 And there His body lay 
 The stone was moved 
 He conquered death 
 And rose from the grave 
 By His wounds I am set free 
 By His blood I've been redeemed 
 The great divide He crossed for me 
 Oh, praise the God of Calvary 
 And if I never 
 Never lose sight of this place 
 I will never 
 Never lose sight of Your grace 
 The Cross is all 
 All I need to see 
 Oh, praise the God of Calvary 
 By Your wounds I am set free 
 By Your blood I've been redeemed 
 The great divide You crossed for me 
 Oh, praise the God of Calvary 
 Your Cross is all 
 All I need to see 
 Oh, praise the God of Calvary

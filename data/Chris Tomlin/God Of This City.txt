You're the God of this city 
 You're the King of these people 
 You're the Lord of this nation 
 You are 
 You're the light in this darkness 
 You're the hope to the hopeless 
 You're the peace to the restless 
 You are 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like our God 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done in this city 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done in this city 
 You're the God of this city 
 You're the King of this people 
 You're the Lord of this nation 
 You are 
 You're the Light in this darkness 
 You're the Hope to the hopeless 
 You're the Peace to the restless 
 You are 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like our God 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done in this city 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done in this city 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done here 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like You God 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done in this city 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done 
 We believe, we believe in You, God 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done in this city 
 For greater things have yet to come 
 And greater things are still to be done here 
 Greater things 
 Still to be done here

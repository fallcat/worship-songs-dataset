I'm coming back to the start 
 Where You found me 
 I'm coming back to Your heart 
 Now I surrender 
 Take me 
 This is all I can bring 
 I'm coming back to the start 
 Our God is freedom 
 And here we feel Your heart 
 Your heart beat for us 
 Take me 
 This is all I can bring 
 You'll never stop loving us 
 No matter how far we run 
 You'll never give up on us 
 All of heaven is shouting 
 Let the future begin 
 Let the future begin 
 Take me 
 This is all I can bring 
 You'll never stop loving us 
 No matter how far we run 
 You'll never give up on us 
 All of heaven is shouting 
 Let the future begin 
 I feel alive 
 I come alive 
 I am alive on Gods great dance floor 
 I feel alive 
 I come alive 
 I am alive on God's great dance floor 
 I feel alive 
 I come alive 
 I am alive on God's great dance floor 
 I feel alive 
 I come alive 
 I am alive on God's great dance floor 
 I feel alive 
 I come alive 
 I am alive on God's great dance floor

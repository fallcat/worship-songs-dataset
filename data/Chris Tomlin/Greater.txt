From him, through him, and to him are all things 
 To God be the glory 
 His word endures from beginning to end 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Greater is the one who lives in me 
 Greater is the love of Jesus 
 Greater than my sin 
 Greater than the grave 
 Above all other thrones 
 Above all other names 
 Greater, You are greater 
 He was, and is, and forever will be 
 To God be the glory 
 His power in us 
 He is strength for the weak 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Greater is the one who lives in me 
 Greater is the love of Jesus 
 Greater than my sin 
 Greater than the grave 
 Above all other thrones 
 Above all other names 
 Greater, You are greater 
 Jesus, You reign forever 
 Jesus, You reign forever 
 There's no one like you 
 Jesus, You reign 
 Jesus, You reign forever 
 Jesus, You reign forever 
 There's none beside You 
 Jesus, You reign 
 Jesus, You reign 
 Greater is the one who lives in me 
 Greater is the love of Jesus 
 Greater than my sin 
 Greater than the grave 
 Above all other thrones 
 Above all other names 
 Greater is the one who lives in me 
 Greater is the love of Jesus 
 Greater than my sin 
 Greater than the grave 
 Above all other thrones 
 Above all other names 
 Greater, You are greater

Well I could sing unending songs 
 Of how You saved my soul 
 I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of Your great love 
 C'mon everybody dance 
 Everybody dance 
 My heart is bursting Lord to 
 To tell of all You've done 
 Of how've You changed my life 
 And wiped away the past 
 Well, I want to shout it out 
 From every roof top sing 
 For now I know 
 That God is for me, not against me 
 I could sing unending songs 
 Of how You saved my soul 
 And I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of Your great love 
 My heart is bursting Lord to 
 To tell of all You've done 
 Of how've you changed my life 
 And wiped away the past 
 Well I want to shout it out 
 From every roof top sing 
 For now I know 
 That God is for me, not against me 
 Everybody's singin' now 
 Cuz we're so happy 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Everybody's dancin' now 
 Cuz we're so happy 
 If only I could see Your face, 
 See You smiling over us 
 And unseen angels celebrate 
 Hey! The joy is in this place 
 Yeah, 
 The joy is in this place 
 I could sing unending songs 
 Of how You've saved my soul 
 And I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of Your great love 
 And I could sing unending songs 
 Of how You've saved my soul 
 And I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of Your great love

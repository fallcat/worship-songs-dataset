From heaven to earth our Savior came 
 For us on a cross, He bled and died 
 And from the cross to an empty grave 
 He rose to life, He rose to life 
 He lives reigning in power 
 He lives, name above all names 
 Hallelujah now forever 
 Hallelujah Christ is ri-sen! 
 All glory to Him upon the throne 
 Forever exalted and seated high 
 The Lamb of God He has overcome! 
 He is alive, He is alive! 
 He lives reigning in power 
 He lives, name above all names 
 Hallelujah now forever 
 Hallelujah Christ is risen! 
 He is risen 
 And on that day with Him I'll rise 
 For Christ He lives in me 
 This life I life no longer mine 
 For Christ He lives in me 
 And on that day with Him I'll rise 
 For Christ He lives in me 
 This life I life no longer mine 
 For Christ He lives in me 
 He lives reigning in power 
 He lives, name above all names 
 Hallelujah now forever 
 Hallelujah Christ is risen 
 He lives reigning in power 
 He lives, name above all names 
 Hallelujah now forever 
 Hallelujah Christ is risen

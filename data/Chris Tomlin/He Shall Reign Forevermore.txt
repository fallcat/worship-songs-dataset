In the bleak mid-winter, all creation groans 
 For a world in darkness, frozen like a stone 
 Light is breaking, in a stable 
 For a throne 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 Unto us a child is born 
 The King of kings and Lord of lords 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 If I were a wise man, I would travel far 
 And if I were a shepherd, I would do my part 
 But poor as I am 
 I will give to Him my heart 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 Unto us a child is born 
 The King of kings and Lord of lords 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 Here within a manger lies 
 The One who made the starry skies 
 This baby born for sacrifice 
 Christ, the Messiah 
 Into our hopes, into our fears 
 The Savior of the world appears 
 The promise of eternal years 
 Christ, the Messiah 
 He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore 
 Unto us a child is born 
 The King of kings and Lord of lords 
 And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore

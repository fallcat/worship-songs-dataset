Got a funny feeling 
 It's making my head kind of sore 
 Something tells me 
 She don't love me anymore 
 Like when she sprayed graffiti 
 On a gang member's car 
 And left my phone number on the hood 
 Or when she wore camouflage 
 And dressed me as a deer 
 For a costume party in the woods 
 Got a funny feeling 
 It's making my head kind of sore 
 Something tells me 
 She don't love me anymore 
 Like when she tried to iron my shirt 
 While I still had it on 
 And now I've got the scars for the proof 
 Or when she came by my house 
 Last night to watch the stars 
 And I broke my leg 
 When she pushed me off my roof 
 Got a funny feeling 
 It's making my head kind of sore 
 Something tells me 
 She don't love me anymore 
 Like when she sent me a card on Valentine's day 
 And sealed it with a kiss 
 I ain't complaining 
 But she wrote it to Ross 
 And last time I checked 
 My name was Chris 
 Got a funny feeling 
 It's making my head kind of sore 
 Something tells me 
 She don't love me anymore 
 Got a funny feeling 
 She slammed my face in the door 
 Something tells me 
 She don't love me anymore

This world is not what it was meant to be 
 All this pain, all this suffering 
 There's a better place 
 Waiting for me 
 In Heaven 
 Every tear will be wiped away 
 Every sorrow and sin erased 
 We'll dance on seas of amazing grace 
 In Heaven 
 In Heaven 
 I'm goin' home 
 Where the streets are golden 
 Every chain is broken 
 Oh I wanna go 
 Oh I wanna go 
 Home 
 Where every fear is gone 
 I'm in your open arms 
 Where I belong 
 Home 
 Lay down my burdens, I lay down my past 
 I run to Jesus, no turning back 
 Thank God Almighty, I'll be free at last 
 In Heaven 
 In Heaven 
 I'm goin' home 
 Where the streets are golden 
 Every chain is broken 
 Oh I wanna go 
 Oh I wanna go 
 Home 
 Where every fear is gone 
 I'm in your open arms 
 Where I belong 
 Blinded eyes 
 Will finally see 
 The dead will rise 
 On the shores of eternity 
 The trump will sound 
 The angels will sing 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 I am 
 Goin' home 
 Where the streets are golden 
 Every chain is broken 
 Oh I wanna go 
 Oh I wanna go 
 Home 
 Where every fear is gone 
 I'm in your open arms 
 Where I belong 
 Where I belong 
 I'm goin' home 
 I'm goin' home 
 I'm on my way home 
 I'm goin' home

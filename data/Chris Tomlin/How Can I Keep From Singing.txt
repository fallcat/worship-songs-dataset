There is an endless song 
 Echoes in my soul 
 I hear the music ring 
 And though the storms may come 
 I am holding on 
 To the rock I cling 
 How can I keep from signing Your praise 
 How can I ever say enough 
 How amazing is Your love 
 How can I keep from shouting Your name 
 I know I am loved by the King 
 And it makes my heart want to sing 
 I will lift my eyes 
 In the darkest night 
 For I know my Savior lives 
 And I will walk with You 
 Knowing You'll see me through 
 And sing the songs You give 
 How can I keep from signing Your praise 
 How can I ever say enough 
 How amazing is Your love 
 How can I keep from shouting Your name 
 I know I am loved by the King 
 And it makes my heart want to sing 
 I can sing in the troubled times 
 Sing when I win 
 I can sing when I lose my step 
 And fall down again 
 I can sing 'cause You pick me up 
 Sing 'cause You're there 
 I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord 
 When I call to You in prayer 
 I can sing with my last breath 
 Sing for I know 
 That I'll sing with the angels 
 And the saints around the throne 
 How can I keep from signing Your praise 
 How can I ever say enough 
 How amazing is Your love 
 How can I keep from shouting Your name 
 I know I am loved by the King 
 And it makes my heart 
 I am loved by the King 
 And it makes my heart 
 I am loved by the King 
 And it makes my heart want to sing, yeah 
 I can sing

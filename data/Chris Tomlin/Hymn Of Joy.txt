Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee 
 God of glory, Lord of love 
 Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee 
 Opening to the sun above 
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness 
 Drive the dark of doubt away 
 Giver of immortal gladness 
 Fill us with the light of day 
 Rejoice, rejoice! 
 Emmanuel 
 Your love has come 
 Here to dwell 
 All Thy works with joy surround Thee 
 Earth and heaven reflect thy rays 
 Stars and angels sing around Thee 
 Center of unbroken praise 
 Field and forest, vale and mountain 
 Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea 
 Singing bird and flowing fountain 
 Call us to rejoice in Thee 
 Rejoice, rejoice! 
 Emmanuel 
 Your love has come 
 Here to dwell 
 Rejoice, rejoice! 
 Emmanuel 
 Your love has come 
 Here to dwell 
 Mortals join the happy chorus 
 Which the morning stars began 
 Father love is reigning o'er us 
 Brother love binds man to man 
 Ever singing march we onward 
 Victors in the midst of strife 
 Joyful music leads us sunward 
 In the triumph song of life

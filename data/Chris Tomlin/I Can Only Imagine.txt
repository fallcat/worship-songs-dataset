I can only imagine 
 What it would be like 
 When I walk, by Your side 
 I can only imagine 
 What my eyes would see 
 When Your face, is before me 
 I can only imagine 
 Surrounded by Your glory 
 What will my heart feel 
 Will I dance for You, Jesus? 
 Or in awe of You be still 
 Will I stand in Your presence 
 To my knees will I fall 
 Will I sing Hallelujah 
 Will I be able to speak at all 
 I can only imagine 
 I can only imagine 
 When that day comes 
 And I find myself 
 Standing in the son 
 I can only imagine 
 When all I will do 
 Is forever, forever worship You 
 I can only imagine

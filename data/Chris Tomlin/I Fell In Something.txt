Like an angel she floated right into my life 
 Like a devil she 
 Like a bandit she took all the hope that I had 
 When she walked out and left me behind 
 I fell in deep 
 I fell in hard 
 Up to my knees 
 Down in her heart 
 I fell too fast 
 I fell too far 
 Now something just stinks 
 When I think about us 
 I fell in something 
 It was enough

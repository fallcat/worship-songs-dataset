Be still, there is a healer 
 His love is deeper than the sea 
 His mercy is unfailing 
 His arms, a fortress for the weak 
 Let faith arise, let faith arise 
 I lift my hands to believe again 
 You are my refuge, You are my strength 
 As I pour out my heart, these things I remember 
 You are faithful, God, forever 
 Be still, there is a river 
 That flows from Calvary's tree 
 A fountain for the thirsty 
 Your grace that washes over me 
 Let faith arise, let faith arise 
 I lift my hands to believe again 
 You are my refuge, You are my strength 
 As I pour out my heart, these things I remember 
 You are faithful, God, forever 
 I lift my hands to believe again 
 You are my refuge, You are my strength 
 As I pour out my heart, these things I remember 
 You are faithful, God, forever 
 Let faith arise 
 Let faith arise 
 Open my eyes 
 Open my eyes 
 Let faith arise 
 Let faith arise 
 Open my eyes 
 Open my eyes 
 I lift my hands to believe again 
 You are my refuge, You are my strength 
 As I pour out my heart, these things I remember 
 You are faithful, God, forever 
 I lift my hands to believe again 
 You are my refuge, You are my strength 
 As I pour out my heart, these things I remember 
 You are faithful, God 
 You are faithful, God, forever 
 Let faith arise 
 Let faith arise

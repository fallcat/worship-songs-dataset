I will boast only in the cross 
 Where my Savior died for me 
 Nothing else, no other love 
 Goes so far and runs so deep 
 I will boast only in the cross 
 See His head, His hands, and feet 
 Scars of grace, scars that heal 
 He broke the curse and set me free 
 Only One took the nails 
 Only One tore the veil 
 Only One spotless Lamb 
 I will boast only in the cross 
 I will boast only in the cross 
 The Father's love at Calvary 
 My sin erased, my debt He paid 
 This is my hope, the song I sing 
 This is my hope, the song I sing 
 Only One took the nails 
 Only One tore the veil 
 Only One spotless Lamb 
 I will boast only in the cross

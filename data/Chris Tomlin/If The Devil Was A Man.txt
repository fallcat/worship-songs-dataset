Tell me why 
 I always do, 
 Things that I know deep down 
 I don't really want to do. 
 I try to walk in faith 
 But it's not easy with him around 
 Ah, with him around. 
 Like when you're walkin' in the dark 
 And you stub your toe. 
 It hurts so bad, makes you mad, 
 And cuss words start to flow. 
 And Satan, he's just laughing, 'cause 
 He knows I'm fallin' in despair. 
 I wish he's fight me fair. 
 If the devil was a man 
 With a body just like mine 
 If it wasn't a sin to fight with him, 
 I'd punch him in the eye. 
 He can growl and snarl at me but 
 All to no avail. 
 If the devil was a man, I'd kick his tail. 
 Sometimes I hear an unholsome tough. 
 And I say things I shouldn't say, 
 When I should probably walk away. 
 And it's a sin I've got spinnin' 
 And Satan thinks he's gonna win, 
 Aww... think again. 
 I can punch, I can kick. 
 Feed him food that makes him sick. 
 If the devil was a man with a body just like mine 
 If it wasn't a sin to fight with him, 
 I'd punch him in the eye. 
 He can growl and snarl at me 
 But all to no avail. 
 If the devil was a man I'd kick his tail. 
 You might think that I'm crazy, 
 You might say that I'm a nut. 
 But if the devil was a man, I'd kick his... 
 But I guess you're wonderin', 
 What kind of spell I'm under 
 Singin' songs of silly fantasies. 
 You know that I'm just jokin', 
 There's no better way to hope for 
 'Cause I know, greater is He that's alive in me. 
 (Talk) 
 Sometimes my life is full of sin, 
 Girl walks by, I look at her, 
 And I look at her again. 
 And I'm too proud to pray out loud 
 And say what I've done wrong, 
 Aww that devil's strong. 
 Things are lookin' bad for me 
 But I know there's victory. 
 'Cause the devil ain't a man 
 With a body just like mine. 
 Sometimes he sneaks up on me 
 And hits me from behind. 
 He can growl and snarl at me, 
 But all to no avail. 
 'Cause my God's big enough to kick his tail. 
 My God's big enough, 
 My God's big enough, 
 Yeah, My God's big enough 
 My God's big enough 
 (Take it on) 
 My God's big enough 
 My God's big enough 
 (To kick his tail) 
 My God's big enough 
 My God's big enough 
 My God's big enough to kick his little red tail.

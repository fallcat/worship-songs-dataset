You heal the broken hearted 
 You set the captive free 
 You lift the heavy burden 
 And even now, You are lifting me 
 There is no healer 
 Like the Lord our maker 
 There is no equal to the King of kings, oh-oh 
 Our God is with us, we will fear no evil 
 'Cause You do, Impossible things 
 'Cause You do, Impossible things 
 Though I walk through the valley 
 Darkness surrounding me 
 There You prepare a table, hmm-hmm 
 In the presence of my enemies, yeah-eh 
 There is no healer 
 Like the Lord our maker 
 There is no equal to the King of kings, oh-oh 
 Our God is with us, we will fear no evil 
 'Cause You do, Impossible things 
 Yeah, You do, the Impossible Impossible 
 One Word, and the walls start falling 
 One Word, and the blind will see 
 One Word, and the sinner's forgiven 
 'Cause You do Impossible (Impossible things) 
 And one Word, and the walls start falling (oh start falling) 
 One Word, and the blind will see (and the blind will see) 
 One Word, and the sinner's forgiven (oh sinner's forgiven) 
 'Cause You do (wooh) Impossible things (oh Impossible things) 
 There is no healer 
 Like the Lord our maker 
 There is no equal to the King of kings, oh-oh 
 Our God is with us, we will fear no evil (I will fear no evil) 
 'Cause You do Impossible things (Impossible things, yeah) 
 There is no healer 
 Like the Lord our maker (the Lord our maker) 
 There is no equal to the King of kings (King of kings) 
 Our God is with us, we will fear no evil (Oh-oh) 
 'Cause You do Impossible things (Impossible things) 
 'Cause You do Impossible things 
 You do more than I could ask 
 Or even imagine (walls are falling) 
 You are, more than I could ask 
 You're more than enough (You do, You do Impossible) 
 Impossible 
 You heal the broken hearted (Hmm-hmmm) 
 You set the captive free (set us free, yeah) 
 You lift the heavy burden (Oh-oh oh-oh) 
 And even now, You are lifting me 
 Yes, even now, You are lifting me (lifting me) 
 Oh and even now, You are lifting me (lifting me oh) 
 'Cause You do Impossible things...

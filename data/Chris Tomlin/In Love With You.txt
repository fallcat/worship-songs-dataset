I feel like singing now 
 My heart is free 
 You've forgiven me 
 Your name's the sweetest sound to my ears, 
 Lord hold me near 
 I'm in love, love with You 
 Like I never dreamed 
 I'm in love, love with You 
 And I'm flying free 
 From the things that tie me down 
 I'm walking on the ground 
 I'm in love, love with You 
 You're all I think about 
 Day and night all the time 
 How you make my world 
 Go 'round and make it stop 
 You're all I got

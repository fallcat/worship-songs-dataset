In the secret, in the quiet place 
 In the stillness You are there. 
 In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait, 
 Only for You,'cause I want to know You more; 
 I want to know You, 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more. 
 I want to touch You, 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more. 
 I am reaching for the highest goal, 
 Then I might receive the prize. 
 Pressing onward, pushing every hindering aside, 
 Out of my way, 'cause I want to know you more 
 I want to know You, 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more. 
 I want to touch You, 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more. 
 I want to know You, 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more. 
 I want to touch You, 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more. 
 In the secret, in the quiet place 
 In the stillness You are there

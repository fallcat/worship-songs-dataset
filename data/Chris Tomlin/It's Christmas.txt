Away in a manger no crib for a bed 
 The little Lord Jesus laid down 
 His sweet head, the stars in the sky 
 Looked down where He lay 
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay 
 The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes 
 But little Lord Jesus, no crying 
 He makes, I love Thee Lord Jesus! 
 Look down from the sky and stay 
 By my cradle till morning is nigh 
 It's Christmas! 
 The angels are singing 
 And I know the reason, 
 The Savior is born 
 It's Christmas! 
 The bells are ringing 
 And I feel like shouting 
 Joy to the world! 
 Be near me, Lord Jesus I ask Thee to stay 
 Close by me forever and love me I pray 
 Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care 
 And fit us for heaven 
 To live with Thee there 
 It's Christmas! 
 The angels are singing 
 And I know the reason, 
 The Savior is born 
 It's Christmas! 
 The bells are ringing 
 And I feel like shouting 
 Joy to the world! 
 Go tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere! 
 Go, tell it on the mountain that 
 Jesus Christ is born! 
 It's Christmas! 
 The angels are singing 
 And I know the reason, 
 The Savior is born 
 It's Christmas! 
 The bells are ringing 
 And I feel like shouting 
 Joy to the world!

I was lost 
 I was in chains 
 The world had a hold of me 
 My heart was a stone 
 I was covered in shame 
 When He came for me 
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His presence 
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His arms 
 Jesus, He loves me, He loves me, He is for me 
 Jesus, how can it be, He loves me, He is for me 
 It was a fire 
 Deep in my soul 
 I'll never be the same 
 I stepped out of the dark 
 And into the light 
 When He called my name 
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His presence 
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His arms 
 Jesus, He loves me, He loves me, He is for me 
 Jesus, how can it be, He loves me, He is for me 
 He holds the stars and He holds my heart 
 With healing hands that bear the scars 
 The rugged cross where He died for me 
 My only hope, my everything 
 Jesus, He loves me, He loves me 
 Jesus, how can it be, He loves me, He is for me 
 He loves me, He loves me, He loves me 
 He loves me, He is for me 
 He loves me, my God it's amazing 
 Jesus loves me

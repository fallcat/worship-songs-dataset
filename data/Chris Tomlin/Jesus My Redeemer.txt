You traded riches to run to my rescue 
 Oh, my Redeemer 
 You take the pieces and turn them to praises 
 Oh, my Redeemer 
 Oh, my Redeemer 
 Love I cannot deny 
 Sure as the morning light 
 Jesus, my Redeemer, oh 
 You paid my ransom 
 You chose to suffer 
 Oh, my Redeemer 
 Oh, my Redeemer 
 Love I cannot deny 
 Sure as the morning light 
 Jesus, my redeemer 
 Now I am not ashamed 
 To You be the highest praise 
 Jesus, my Redeemer 
 My Redeemer 
 Hmmm 
 No other One so glorious 
 You outshine the sun 
 No other love like Jesus 
 You outshine the sun 
 You outshine the sun 
 You outshine the sun 
 Yeah, You outshine the sun 
 Outshine the sun, outshine the sun, yeah 
 You shine 
 You shine, yeah 
 Love I cannot deny 
 Sure as the morning light 
 Jesus, my Redeemer, oh my Redeemer 
 Now I am not ashamed (I'm not ashamed) 
 To You be the highest praise, oh 
 Jesus, my Redeemer 
 My Redeemer 
 My Redeemer 
 Oh, You shine 
 How You shine 
 My Redeemer

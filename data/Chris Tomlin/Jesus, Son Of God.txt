You came down, from heaven's throne 
 This earth You formed, was not Your home 
 A love like this, the world had never known 
 A crown of thorns, to mock your name 
 Forgiveness fell upon Your face 
 A love like this, the world had never known 
 On the altar of our praise 
 Let there be no higher name 
 Jesus Son of God 
 You laid down Your perfect life 
 You are the sacrifice 
 Jesus Son of God 
 You are Jesus Son of God 
 You took our sin 
 You bore our shame 
 You rose to life 
 You defeated the grave 
 A love like this, the world has never known 
 You took our sin 
 You bore our shame 
 You rose to life 
 You defeated the grave 
 A love like this, the world has never known 
 On the altar of our praise 
 Let there be no higher name 
 Jesus Son of God 
 You laid down Your perfect life 
 You are the sacrifice 
 Jesus Son of God 
 You are Jesus Son of God 
 Be lifted higher 
 Than all You've overcome 
 Your name be louder 
 Than any other song 
 There is no power 
 That can come against Your love 
 The cross was enough 
 The cross was enough 
 The cross was enough 
 The cross was enough

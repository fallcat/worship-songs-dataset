There is a truth older than the ages 
 There is a promise of things yet to come 
 There is one, born for our salvation 
 Jesus 
 There is a light that overwhelms the darkness 
 There is a kingdom that forever reigns 
 There is freedom from the chains that bind us 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Who walks on the waters 
 Who speaks to the sea 
 Who stands in the fire beside me 
 He roars like a lion 
 He bled as the lamb 
 He carries my healing in his hands 
 Jesus 
 There is a name I call in times of trouble 
 There is a song that comforts in the night 
 There is a voice that calms the storm that rages 
 He is Jesus, Jesus 
 Who walks on the waters 
 Who speaks to the sea 
 Who stands in the fire beside me 
 He roars like a lion 
 He bled as the lamb 
 He carries my healing in his hands 
 Jesus 
 Messiah, my Saviour 
 There is power in Your name 
 You're my rock and, my redeemer 
 There is power in Your name 
 In Your name 
 You walk on the waters 
 You speak to the sea 
 You stand in the fire beside me 
 You roar like a lion 
 You bled as the lamb 
 You carry my healing in Your hands 
 God, you walk on the waters 
 You speak to the sea 
 You stand in the fire beside me 
 You roar like a lion 
 You bled as the lamb 
 You carry my healing in Your hands 
 Jesus 
 There is no one like you 
 Jesus 
 There is no one like you

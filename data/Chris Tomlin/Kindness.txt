Open up the skies of mercy 
 And rain down the cleansing flood 
 Healing waters rise around us 
 And hear our cries, Lord 
 Let 'em rise 
 Open up the skies of mercy 
 And rain down the cleansing flood 
 Healing waters rise around us 
 And hear our cries, Lord 
 Let 'em rise 
 It's Your kindness, Lord 
 That leads us to repentance 
 Your favor, Lord 
 Is our desire 
 It's Your beauty, Lord 
 That makes us stand in silence 
 And Your love, Your love is better than life 
 We can feel Your mercy falling 
 You are turning our hearts back again 
 Hear our praises rise to heaven 
 Draw us near, Lord 
 Meet us here 
 It's Your kindness, Lord 
 That leads us to repentance 
 Your favor, Lord 
 Is our desire 
 It's Your beauty, Lord 
 That makes us stand in silence 
 And Your love, Your love 
 It's Your kindness, Lord 
 That leads us to repentance 
 Your favor, Lord 
 Is our desire 
 It's Your beauty, Lord 
 That makes us stand in silence 
 And Your love, Your love is better than life 
 It's better than life 
 Your love 
 Open up the skies of mercy 
 And rain down the cleansing flood 
 Healing waters rise around us 
 And hear our cries, Lord 
 Let 'em rise 
 Spoken: 
 Lord, we stand here as a desperate people 
 Hungry for the things of You 
 Come quiet the storms that rage all around us 
 So that we hear the passion that beats through Your heart 
 Spirit, put healing in our hands 
 Put life in our words 
 And drive a passion for the lost deep in the hearts of Your people 
 Inhabit the praises of us, Your children 
 And, Father, send us out with a reckless passion 
 Deliver us from evil 
 And set a standard of unity to break down walls and to heal Your people 
 Unity is the cry of Your church, Lord 
 Reconcile the children to the fathers 
 And with forgiveness and mercy, rushing through the hearts of our land 
 We cry out our deep need for You, Jesus 
 Oh, God, come in power and bring glory to Your name

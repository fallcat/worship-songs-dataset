Lift up your gaze 
 Be lifted up 
 Tell everyone 
 How great the love 
 The love come down 
 From heaven's gate 
 To kiss the earth 
 With hope and grace 
 Sing 
 Who is this King of Glory? 
 The Lord, strong and mighty 
 Who is this King of Glory? 
 The Lord, strong and mighty 
 Lift up your hands 
 Be lifted up 
 Let the redeemed 
 Declare the love 
 We bow down 
 At heaven's gate 
 To kiss the feet 
 Of hope and grace 
 Sing 
 Who is this King of Glory? 
 The Lord, strong and mighty 
 Who is this King of Glory? 
 The Lord, strong and mighty 
 There is one God 
 He is Holy 
 There is one Lord 
 Over everything 
 There is one King 
 He is Jesus 
 King of glory 
 Strong and mighty 
 There is one God 
 He is Holy 
 There is one Lord 
 Over everything 
 There is one King 
 He is Jesus 
 King of glory 
 Strong and mighty 
 You are the King of Glory 
 The Lord, strong and mighty 
 You are the King of Glory 
 The Lord, strong and mighty 
 You are the King of Glory 
 The Lord, strong and mighty 
 You are the King of Glory 
 The Lord, strong and mighty

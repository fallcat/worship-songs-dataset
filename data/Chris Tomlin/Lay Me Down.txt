With this heart open wide 
 From the depths from the heights 
 I will bring a sacrifice 
 With these hands lifted high 
 Hear my song hear my cry 
 I will bring a sacrifice 
 I will bring a sacrifice 
 I lay me down 
 I'm not my own 
 I belong to you alone 
 Lay me down 
 Lay me down 
 Hand on my heart 
 This much is true 
 There's no life apart from you 
 Lay me down 
 Lay me down 
 Oh oh oh 
 Lay me down 
 Lay me down 
 Letting go of my pride 
 Giving up all my rights 
 Take this life and let it shine 
 Take this life and let it shine 
 It will be my joy to say 
 Your will 
 Your way 
 It will be my joy to say 
 Your will 
 Your way 
 It will be my joy to say 
 Your will 
 Your way 
 Always

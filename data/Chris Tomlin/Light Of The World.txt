O, Jesus Son of God 
 So full of grace and truth 
 The Father's saving Word 
 So wonderful are You 
 The angels longed to see 
 And prophets searched to find 
 The glory we have seen revealed 
 You shone upon the Earth 
 But who will understand 
 You came unto Your own 
 But who will recognize 
 Your birth was prophesied 
 For You were the Messiah 
 Who came and walked upon the Earth 
 Your glory we have seen 
 The one and only King 
 And now You're living in our hearts 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 In You all things were made 
 And nothing without You 
 In Heaven and on Earth 
 All things are held in You 
 And yet You became flesh 
 Living as one of us 
 Under the shadow of the cross 
 Where through the blood You shed 
 You have made peace again 
 Peace for the world that God so loves, yeah 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 So full of grace and truth 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 So wonderful are You 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 And yet You became flesh 
 Living as one of us 
 Under the shadow of the cross 
 Where through the blood You shed 
 You have made peace again 
 Peace for the world that God so loves 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Shine it, Lord 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Your glory shines around 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 You shine over us, shine 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 You shine, You shine 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us

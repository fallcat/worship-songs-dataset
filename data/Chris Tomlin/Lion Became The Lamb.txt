It was in the dark I heard You calling 
 A mighty voice whisper my name 
 A fire inside; a sweet surrender 
 My eyes began to see the beauty of the Savior 
 On alters of stone in the human heart 
 You laid down your life; You took our part 
 For the sin of the world, the ransom of all 
 The Lion became the Lamb of God 
 The Lion became the Lamb of God 
 No greater love; no one but Jesus 
 Could roll away, roll away the night 
 Immanuel; the gift of heaven 
 You've crushed the enemy; I'm alive and I'm forgiven 
 On alters of stone in the human heart 
 You laid down your life; You took our part 
 For the sin of the world, the ransom of all 
 The Lion became the Lamb of God 
 The Lion became the Lamb of God 
 And the time had come though the war was won 
 The battle for my freedom had just begun 
 But You wouldn't abandon me for the sake of Your story 
 On alters of stone in the human heart 
 You laid down your life; You took our part 
 For the sin of the world, the ransom of all 
 The Lion became the Lamb 
 On alters of stone in the human heart 
 You laid down your life; You took our part 
 For the sin of the world, the ransom of all 
 The Lion became the Lamb 
 You are seated at the Father's right hand 
 The Lion became the Lamb of God

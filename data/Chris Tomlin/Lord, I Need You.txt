Lord I come, I confess 
 Bowing here I find my rest 
 Without You I fall apart 
 You're the one that guides my heart 
 Lord, I need You, oh I need You 
 Every hour I need You 
 My one defense, my righteousness 
 Oh God, how I need You 
 Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more 
 Where grace is found is where You are 
 And where You are Lord I am free 
 Holiness is Christ in me 
 Yes where You are Lord I am free 
 Holiness is Christ in me 
 So teach my song to rise to You 
 When temptation comes my way 
 And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You 
 Jesus You're my hope and stay 
 And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You 
 Jesus You're my hope and stay

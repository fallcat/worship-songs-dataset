There is love 
 There is love 
 There is love 
 There is love 
 When our hope is hard to find 
 And our faith is in decline, 
 We need a cause to stand behind -- love. 
 We all want the way it feels. 
 Time it comes and time it steals. 
 What remains, what is real - love. 
 There is love, 
 There is forgiveness. 
 There is love in times of need. 
 When life is cold there is a promise. 
 You will never go without.... 
 There is love. 
 There is love 
 It heals the sick, 
 Comforts the weak. 
 Breaks the proud, 
 Raises the meek. 
 In this life no guarantees...but there is love. 
 There is love, 
 There is forgiveness. 
 There is love in times of need. 
 When life is cold there is a promise. 
 You will never go without.... 
 Love is the answer. 
 Love will find a way. 
 When we love one another 
 It's a brighter day. 
 Love is the answer. 
 Love will find a way. 
 When we love one another 
 It's a brighter day. 
 When life is cold there is a promise. 
 You will never go without.... 
 There is love, 
 There is forgiveness. 
 There is love in times of need. 
 When life is cold there is a promise. 
 You will never go without.... 
 Love there is love

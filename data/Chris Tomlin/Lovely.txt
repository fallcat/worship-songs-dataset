I watch Your wonders fill the sky 
 Over the mountains reaching high 
 The same majesty floods my life 
 I stand in awe 
 Lovely, there is none more lovely 
 In all the universe, there is no one lovelier 
 Worthy, there is none more worthy 
 I try to find the words, there's so much more You're worthy of 
 Up on the cross with open arms 
 The love of God reaches far 
 The same majesty floods my heart 
 I stand in awe 
 Lovely, there is none more lovely 
 In all the universe, there is no one lovelier 
 Worthy, there is none more worthy 
 I try to find the words, there's so much more You're worthy of 
 There's so much more You're worthy of 
 As long as I live, I'll praise You, Lord 
 Name above all, be lifted high 
 All of my days, I worship You 
 I worship You 
 Lovely, You are lovely 
 There is no one, there is no one more worthy 
 You are worthy 
 I try to find the words, there is no one lovelier 
 Lovely, there is none more lovely 
 In all the universe, there is no one lovelier (there is no one) 
 Worthy, You alone are worthy 
 I try to find the words, (I try to find the words) there's so much more You're worthy of 
 (There's so much more You're worthy of) 
 There's so much more You're worthy of 
 (There's so much more You're worthy of) 
 There's so much more You're worthy of 
 You are worthy 
 You are worthy

Before the day 
 Before the light 
 Before the world revolved around the sun 
 God on high 
 Stepped down into time 
 And wrote the story of His love for everyone 
 He has filled our hearts with wonder 
 So that we always remember 
 You and I were made to worship 
 You and I are called to love 
 You and I are forgiven and free 
 When you and I embrace surrender 
 When you and I choose to believe 
 Then you and I will see who we were meant to be 
 All we are 
 And all we have 
 Is all a gift from God that we receive 
 Brought to life 
 We open up our eyes 
 To see the majesty and glory of the King 
 He has filled our hearts with wonder 
 So that we always remember 
 You and I were made to worship 
 You and I are called to love 
 You and I are forgiven and free 
 When you and I embrace surrender 
 When you and I choose to believe 
 Then you and I will see who we were meant to be 
 And even the rocks cry out 
 And even the heavens shout 
 At the sound of His Holy name 
 So let every voice sing out 
 And let every knee bow down 
 He is worthy of all our praise 
 You and I were made to worship 
 You and I are called to love 
 You and I are forgiven and free, yeah 
 When you and I embrace surrender 
 When you and I choose to believe 
 Then you and I will see 
 You and I will see 
 You and I were made to worship 
 You and I are called to love 
 You and I are forgiven and free, yeah 
 When you and I embrace surrender 
 When you and I choose to believe 
 Then you and I will see who we were meant to be, yeah 
 Who we were meant to be 
 You and I 
 You and I, yeah, yeah 
 Who we were meant to be

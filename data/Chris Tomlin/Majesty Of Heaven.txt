 Amazed by who You are 
 Nothing compares, You are Lord of all

 Your name will stand forever

 Merciful and mighty 
 My heart is overwhelmed 
 You stand alone, You are Lord of all 
 To You, the nations bow down 
 To You, creation cries out 
 Majesty 
 All things You hold together 
 Your name will stand forever 
 Majesty 
 You are, majesty 
 Your name above all others 
 High and exalted 
 Your kingdom shall reign forever 
 High and exalted 
 Your name above all others 
 High and exalted 
 Your kingdom shall reign forever 
 High and exalted 
 To You, the nations bow down 
 To You, creation cries out

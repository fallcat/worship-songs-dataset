I'm making melody in my heart to You. 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You. 
 Pouring out Your praise 
 With everything within. 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You. 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You. 
 Yours will always be 
 The song I love to sing. 
 How can hearts not love Your name? 
 How can souls not sing Your praise? 
 Jesus, You put music in my soul.

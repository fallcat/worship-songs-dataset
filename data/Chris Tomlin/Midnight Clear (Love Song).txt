It came upon the midnight clear 
 That glorious song of old 
 From angels bending near the earth 
 To touch their harps of gold 
 Peace on the earth, goodwill to men 
 From heaven's all gracious King 
 The world in solemn stillness lay 
 To hear the angels sing 
 Still through the cloven skies they come 
 With peaceful wings unfurled 
 And still their heavenly music floats 
 Through all the weary world 
 And man at war with man hears not 
 The love song which they bring 
 O hush the noise and cease the strife 
 And hear the angels sing 
 Glory to God in the highest 
 Glory to God evermore 
 Good news, great joy for all 
 Melody breaks through the silence 
 Christ, the Savior is born! 
 Jesus, the love song of God! 
 Glory to God in the highest 
 Glory to God evermore 
 Good news, great joy for all 
 Melody breaks through the silence 
 Christ, the Savior is born! 
 Jesus, the love song of God! 
 Jesus, the love song of God! 
 You're the love song 
 You're the love song 
 You so loved the world 
 You're the love song 
 It came upon the midnight clear 
 That glorious song of old 
 From angels bending near the earth 
 To touch their harps of gold

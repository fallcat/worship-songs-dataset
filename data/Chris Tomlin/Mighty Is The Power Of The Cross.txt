What can take a dying man and raise him up to life again? 
 What can heal a wounded soul? 
 What can make us white as snow? 
 What can fill the emptiness? 
 What can mend our brokenness? 
 Brokenness 
 Mighty, awesome, wonderful 
 Is the holy cross 
 Where the Lamb laid down His life 
 To lift us from the fall 
 Mighty is the power of the cross 
 What restores our faith in God? 
 What reveals the Father's love? 
 What can lead the wayward home? 
 What can melt a heart of stone? 
 What can free the guilty ones 
 What can save and overcome? 
 Overcome 
 Mighty, awesome, wonderful 
 Is the holy cross 
 Where the Lamb laid down His life 
 To lift us from the fall 
 Mighty is the power of the cross 
 It's a miracle to me 
 It's a miracle to me 
 It's still a mystery 
 It's still a mystery 
 It's a miracle to me 
 The power of God 
 For those who believe 
 Mighty, awesome, wonderful 
 Is the holy cross 
 Where the Lamb laid down His life 
 To lift us from the fall 
 Oh and mighty, awesome, wonderful 
 Is the holy cross 
 Where the Lamb laid down His life 
 To lift us from the fall

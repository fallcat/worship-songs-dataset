I will wait for You to move 
 For Your mighty hand to save 
 When the trouble waters rise 
 You are my hiding place 
 You are my hiding place 
 Your walls are salvation 
 Your gates are praise 
 Your walls are salvation 
 Your gates are praise 
 My Deliverer 
 My Deliverer 
 My Deliverer 
 Is the Lord 
 Who is like You mighty God 
 Who can take me from Your hand 
 As I walk with You in freedom 
 You're the Rock on which I stand 
 You're the Rock on which I stand 
 Your walls are salvation 
 Your gates are praise 
 Your walls are salvation 
 Your gates are praise 
 My Deliverer 
 My Deliverer 
 My Deliverer 
 Is the Lord 
 My Deliverer 
 My Deliverer 
 My Deliverer

 My Deliverer 
 You're my Deliverer 
 Is the Lord 
 Is the Lord 
 You're my Deliverer                        Is the Lord 
 Thank You, God                              Is the Lord

This is the dream 
 A dream for the world to see You 
 A dream for the world to know You 
 To love Your name 
 Lift up a shout 
 Lift up a cry to shake the ground 
 Shout and the walls are coming down 
 Yeah, we're running after You 
 Like a rolling stone 
 Like a runaway train 
 No turning back 
 No more yesterdays 
 My heart is free 
 No chains on me 
 God, You raise me up 
 Up from the grave 
 With the cross before 
 I'm on my way 
 My heart is free 
 No chains on me 
 Now is the time 
 Now is the time for freedom 
 Abandoned by cold religion 
 My heart on fire 
 We hear the sound 
 The sound of revival coming 
 The sound of Your people rising 
 Yeah, we're running after You 
 Like a rolling stone 
 Like a runaway train 
 No turning back 
 No more yesterdays 
 My heart is free 
 No chains on me 
 God, You raise me up 
 Up from the grave 
 With the cross before 
 I'm on my way 
 My heart is free 
 No chains on me 
 The walls are coming down 
 The walls are coming down 
 The walls are coming down 
 The walls are coming down 
 Yeah 
 The walls are coming down 
 The walls are coming down 
 Like a rolling stone 
 Like a runaway train 
 No turning back 
 No more yesterdays 
 My heart is free 
 No chains on me 
 God, You raise me up 
 Up from the grave 
 With the cross before 
 I'm on my way 
 My heart is free 
 No chains on me 
 I got no chains on me 
 I got no chains on me 
 And my heart is free

 I will follow you 
 No turning back

 This is my heart cry 
 Though none go with me 
 The cross before me 
 The world behind me 
 This is my heart cry 
 Though none go with me 
 The cross before me 
 The world behind me 
 I will follow you (I have decided, I have decided) 
 I will follow you (I have decided) 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 This is my anthem 
 My life for your fame 
 My every move bring 
 Glory to your name

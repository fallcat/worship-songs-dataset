Love incarnate, love divine 
 Star and angels gave the sign 
 Bow to babe on bended knee 
 The Savior of humanity 
 Unto us a Child is born 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 Noel, Noel 
 Come and see what God has done 
 Noel, Noel 
 The story of amazing love! 
 The light of the world, given for us 
 Noel 
 Son of God and Son of man 
 There before the world began 
 Born to suffer, born to save 
 Born to raise us from the grave 
 Christ the everlasting Lord 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 Noel, Noel 
 Come and see what God has done 
 Noel, Noel 
 The story of amazing love! 
 The light of the world, given for us

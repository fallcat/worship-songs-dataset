Not To Us album version: 
 The cross before me, the world behind 
 No turning back, raise the banner high 
 It's not for me 
 It's all for You 
 Let the heavens shake and split the sky 
 Let the people clap their hands and cry 
 It's not for us 
 It's all for You 
 Not to us 
 But to Your name be the glory 
 Not to us 
 But to Your name be the glory 
 Our hearts unfold before Your throne 
 The only place for those who know 
 It's not for us 
 It's all for You 
 Send Your holy fire on this offering 
 Let our worship burn for the world to see 
 It's not for us 
 It's all for You 
 For You 
 Not to us 
 But to Your name be the glory 
 Not to us 
 But to Your name be the glory 
 The earth is shaking 
 The mountains shouting 
 It's all for You 
 The waves are crashing 
 The sun is raging 
 It's all for You 
 The universe 
 Spinning and singing 
 It's all for You 
 Your children dancing, dancing, dancing 
 It's all for You 
 It's all for You 
 My all for You 
 My all for You                     Not to us, but to Your name

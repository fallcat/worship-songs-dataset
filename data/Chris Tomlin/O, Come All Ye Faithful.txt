O come, all ye faithful 
 Joyful and triumphant 
 O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; 
 Come and behold Him 
 Born the King of angels; 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ, the Lord! 
 Sing, choirs of angels 
 Sing in exultation, 
 O sing all ye citizens of Heaven above! 
 Glory to God, all glory in the highest; 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ, the Lord!

 You are the Lord 
 Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, 
 Born this happy morning, 
 Jesus, to Thee be all glory given; 
 Word of the Father, 
 Now in flesh appearing; 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ, the Lord!

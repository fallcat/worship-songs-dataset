Everyone around the world 
 Hear the joyful sound 
 See the heavens open up 
 Hear the music coming down 
 Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love 
 I can't help but celebrate 
 'Cause we're not alone 
 If God is on our side 
 Who can be against us? 
 If God is on our side 
 We won't be afraid 
 Though the mountains may fall 
 And the sky will crumble 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way 
 Come on down to the riverside 
 Wash it all away 
 Leave behind your troubled mind 
 For an uncloudy day 
 Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love 
 I can't help but celebrate 
 'Cause we're not alone 
 If God is on our side 
 Who can be against us? 
 If God is on our side 
 We won't be afraid 
 Though the mountains may fall 
 And the sky will crumble 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way 
 If God is on our side 
 Who can be against us? 
 If God is on our side 
 We won't be afraid 
 Though the mountains may fall 
 And the sky will crumble 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way 
 If God is on our side 
 Who can be against us? 
 If God is on our side 
 We won't be afraid 
 Though the mountains may fall 
 And the sky will crumble 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way 
 If God is on our side 
 Who can be against us? 
 If God is on our side 
 We won't be afraid 
 Though the mountains may fall 
 And the sky will crumble 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way 
 If God is on our side 
 Who can be against us? 
 If God is on our side 
 We won't be afraid 
 Though the mountains may fall 
 And the sky will crumble 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way 
 If God is on our side 
 Who can be against us?

Once and for all the Father's love 
 He is the light in the darkness 
 Who took own flesh and took our place 
 The weight of the world on His shoulder 
 The weight of the world on His shoulders 
 We believe our God is Jesus 
 We believe that He is Lord 
 We believe that He has saved us 
 From sin and death once and for all 
 Once and for all our debt is paid 
 There on the cross it is finished 
 The lamb of God for us was slayed 
 And up from the grave He is risen 
 Up from the grave he is risen 
 We believe our God is Jesus 
 We believe that He is Lord 
 We believe that He has saved us 
 From sin and death once and for all 
 Jesus, Jesus, God from God, light from light 
 You are our salvation 
 Jesus, Jesus, God from God, light from light 
 Your kingdom is forever 
 Jesus, Jesus, God from God, light from light 
 You are our salvation 
 Jesus, Jesus, God from God, light from light 
 Your kingdom is forever 
 We believe our God is Jesus 
 We believe that He is Lord 
 We believe that He has saved us 
 From sin and death once and for all 
 We believe our God is Jesus 
 We believe that He is Lord 
 We believe that He has saved us 
 From sin and death once and for all 
 From sin and death once and for all 
 Once and for all 
 Jesus, Jesus, God from God, light from light 
 You are our salvation 
 Jesus, Jesus, God from God, light from light 
 Your kingdom is forever 
 We believe, we believe 
 And we believe our God is Jesus 
 We believe that He is Lord 
 We believe that He has saved us 
 From sin and death once and for all 
 From sin and death once and for all

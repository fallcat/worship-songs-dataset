All the boys stay 
 And all the girls want out 
 That's the way it is in a one light town 
 All your neighbors are related somehow 
 That's the way it is in a one light town 
 You measure a man by the size of his fish 
 That's the way it is 
 That's the way it is 
 Karaoke not big show biz 
 'Cause that's the way it is in a one light town 
 Let's go 
 Faded blue jeans, a wedding gown 
 That's the way it is in a one light town 
 All three stations play a country sound 
 That's the way it is in a one light town 
 The diamond channel rocks where the mayor lives 
 That's the way it is 
 That's the way it is... 
 Chevy and Ford 
 Separate can 
 'Cause that's the way it is in a one light town 
 Dairy Queen's where the seniors are found 
 That's the way it is in a one light town 
 Participant sport is tipping cow 
 That's the way it is in a one light town 
 Locals say it can't get any better than this 
 That's the way it is 
 That's the way it isâ€¦ 
 City folk better not blink or you miss 
 'Cause that's the way it is in a one light town 
 All you city folk better not blink or you miss 
 'Cause that's the way it is in a one light town

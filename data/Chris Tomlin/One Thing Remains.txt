You hear me when I call 
 You are my morning song 
 Though darkness fills the night 
 It cannot hide the light 
 Whom shall I fear 
 You crush the enemy 
 Underneath my feet 
 You are my sword and shield 
 Though troubles linger still 
 Whom shall I fear 
 I know who goes before me 
 I know who stands behind 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 The one who reigns forever 
 He is a friend of mine 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 My strength is in your name 
 For you alone can save 
 You will deliver me 
 Yours is the victory 
 Whom shall I fear 
 Whom shall I fear 
 I know who goes before me 
 I know who stands behind 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 The one who reigns forever 
 He is a friend of mine 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 And nothing formed against me shall stand 
 You hold the whole world in your hands 
 I'm holding on to your promises 
 You are faithful 
 You are faithful 
 Nothing formed against me shall stand 
 You hold the whole world in your hands 
 I'm holding on to your promises 
 You are faithful 
 You are faithful 
 You are faithful 
 I know who goes before me 
 I know who stands behind 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 The one who reigns forever 
 He is a friend of mine 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 I know who goes before me 
 I know who stands behind 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 The one who reigns forever 
 He is a friend of mine 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side 
 The God of angel armies 
 Is always by my side

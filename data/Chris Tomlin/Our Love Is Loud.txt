When we sing 
 Hear our songs to you 
 When we dance 
 Feel us move to you 
 When we laugh 
 Fill our smiles with you 
 When we lift our voices 
 Louder still 
 Can you hear us 
 Can you feel 
 We love you Lord 
 We love you 
 We love you 
 We love you Lord 
 We love you 
 We love you 
 When we sing (LOUD) 
 Hear our songs to you 
 When we dance (ROUND) 
 Feel us move to you 
 When we laugh (ALOUD) 
 Fill our smiles with you 
 When we lift our voices 
 Louder still 
 Can you hear us 
 Can you feel 
 And our love is big 
 Our love is loud 
 Fill this place with this love now 
 Fill this place with this love now 
 Fill this place with this love now 
 Fill this place with this love now 
 And our love is big 
 Our love is loud 
 Fill our lungs 
 To sing it now 
 We lift our voices louder still 
 Our God is near 
 Our God is here

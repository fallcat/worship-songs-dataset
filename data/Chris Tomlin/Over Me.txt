Father hold me 
 Like a new born child. 
 Father hold me 
 Like a new born child. 
 Father calm me 
 When I run wild. 
 Father, watch over me. 
 Father cool me 
 When the fever's high. 
 Father cool me 
 When the fever's high. 
 Father show me 
 Through Jesus' eyes. 
 Father, watch over me. 
 Over me 
 Like the rain come down. 
 Over me 
 How sweet the sound. 
 Over me 
 Angels gathered round. 
 Father, watch over me. 
 Father call me 
 To Your loving side.

 To Your loving side. 
 Father speak to me 
 And I'll be alright.

 Like the rain come down.

 How sweet the sound. 
 Over me 
 Angels gathered round.

 Like the rain come down.

 How sweet the sound.

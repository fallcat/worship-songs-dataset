Here I bring my stains and crowns 
 Gentle river wash me now 
 Your love is deeper than I know 
 Your ways higher than I can go 
 Lead me in Your holiness 
 I will follow, I confess 
 Glory is the song I sing 
 Your life is living me 
 And where would I be 
 Without You, without You 
 Where would I be 
 Without You 
 I will bow before the cross 
 Cherish my Redeemer's cost 
 There is nothing I can do 
 But only stand amazed by You 
 Mercy new with every day 
 Wrapped up in Your arms of grace 
 Nothing more, You're all I need 
 Your life is living me 
 And where would I be 
 Without You, without You 
 Where would I be 
 Without You 
 Like a waterfall 
 You fill my heart and overflow 
 Like a candle flame 
 You light my way 
 And lead me as I go 
 Like a waterfall 
 You fill my heart and overflow 
 Like a candle flame 
 You light my way 
 And lead me as I go 
 And lead me as I go 
 And where would I be 
 Without You, without You 
 Without You 
 Spirit overflow 
 Let me overflow 
 Spirit overflow 
 Let me overflow 
 Spirit overflow 
 Let me overflow 
 Spirit overflow 
 Let me overflow 
 Let me overflow 
 Let me overflow 
 Let me overflow 
 Let me overflow

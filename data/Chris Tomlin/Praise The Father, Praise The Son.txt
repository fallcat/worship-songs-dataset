O sovereign God, O matchless King 
 The saints adore, the angels sing 
 And fall before the throne of grace 
 To You belongs the highest praise 
 These sufferings, this passing tide 
 Under Your wings I will abide 
 And every enemy shall flee 
 You are my hope and victory 
 Praise the Father, Praise the Son 
 Praise the Spirit, Three in One 
 Clothed in power and in grace 
 The name above all other names 
 To the valley, for my soul 
 Thy great descent has made me whole 
 Your word my heart has welcomed home 
 Now peace like water ever flows 
 So praise the Father, Praise the Son 
 Praise the Spirit, Three in One 
 Clothed in power and in grace 
 The name above all other names 
 Oh, praise the Father, Praise the Son 
 Praise the Spirit, Three in One 
 Clothed in power and in grace 
 The name above all other names 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Yours is the power 
 Yours is the glory 
 Forever 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Yours is the power 
 Yours is the glory 
 Forever 
 Praise the Father, Praise the Son 
 Praise the Spirit, Three in One 
 Clothed in power and in grace 
 The name above all other names 
 The name above all other names

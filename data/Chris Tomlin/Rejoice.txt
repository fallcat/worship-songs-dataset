See the morning, see it rising 
 Over the mountains high 
 See the mercy in the mighty hand of God 
 Living water come and fill us 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Turn our sorrow into singing 
 The song of life 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 Sing with the angel voices 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 All Heaven and earth rejoice 
 Lord, Your strength is a tower 
 The righteous run into 
 Lord, Your love is a banner over us 
 And we hold on to the promise 
 That Your hold on us is true 
 There's no other like You, Jesus 
 No one like You 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 And sing with the angel voices 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 All Heaven and earth rejoice 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 And sing with the angel voices 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 All Heaven and earth rejoice 
 Always 
 Again I say rejoice 
 Always 
 Again I say rejoice 
 Always 
 Again I say rejoice 
 Always, always 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 And sing with the angel voices 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 All Heaven and earth rejoice 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 And sing with the angel voices 
 Rejoice, Rejoice 
 All Heaven and earth rejoice

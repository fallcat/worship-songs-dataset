You called me from the grave by name 
 You called me out of all my shame 
 I see the old has passed away 
 The new has come 
 Now I have resurrection power 
 Living on the inside 
 Jesus, You have given us freedom 
 No longer bound by sin and darkness 
 Living in the light of Your goodness 
 You have given us freedom 
 That I'm dressed in Your royalty 
 Your Holy Spirit lives in me 
 And I see my past has been redeemed 
 The new has come 
 Now I have resurrection power 
 Living on the inside 
 Jesus, You have given us freedom 
 I'm no longer bound by sin and darkness 
 Living in the light of Your goodness 
 You have given us freedom 
 Freedom, You have given us freedom 
 You have given us freedom, my chains are gone 
 Freedom, You have given us freedom 
 You have given us freedom, hallelujah 
 Freedom, You have given us freedom 
 You have given us freedom, my chains are gone 
 Freedom, You have given us freedom 
 You have given us freedom, hallelujah 
 Now I have resurrection power 
 Living on the inside 
 Now, I'm no longer bound by sin and darkness 
 Living in the light of Your goodness 
 You have given us freedom 
 Now I have resurrection power 
 Living on the inside 
 Jesus, You have given us freedom 
 Now, I'm no longer bound by sin and darkness 
 Living in the light of Your goodness 
 You have given us freedom 
 I have resurrection power 
 Living on the inside 
 Living on the inside 
 No longer bound by sin and darkness 
 You have given us freedom 
 You have given us freedom

How many times I've longed for You 
 I long for You once more 
 One moment in Your presence Lord 
 Is all I'm asking for 
 I will seek You till I find You 
 Just to touch You is what I'm living for 
 Let Your glory flood my life 
 Let Your beauty fill my sight 
 Come and carry me away 
 Only then will I be satisfied 
 Let Your glory flood my life 
 Let Your beauty fill my sight 
 Come and carry me away 
 Only then will I be satisfied 
 To lay aside the things I love 
 My throne, my crown, my sin 
 Abandon all to touch Your heart 
 Is my desire again 
 I will seek You till I find You 
 Just to touch You is what I'm living for 
 Let Your glory flood my life 
 Let Your beauty fill my sight 
 Come and carry me away 
 Only then will I be satisfied

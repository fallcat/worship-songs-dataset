I'm no hero of the faith, 
 I'm not as strong as I once thought I was 
 I'm just a shepherd boy, 
 Singing to a choir of burning lights 
 I'm just singing, singing over you 
 Come and lay your troubles down 
 'Cause love is breaking through 
 I was born to lift a song of hope 
 See the heavens open up 
 Take this armor lest I die 
 Take this crown and let me fly 
 We're just singing, singing out to You 
 Our hearts are Yours forever 
 Your love is breaking through 
 Love is a fire 
 Love is a fire 
 Love is a fire

Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing 
 Power and majesty, praise to the King; 
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar 
 At the sound of Your name. 
 I sing for joy at the work of Your hands, 
 Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand, 
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You. 
 My Jesus, my Savior, 
 Lord, there is none like You; 
 All of my days 
 I want to praise 
 The wonders of Your mighty love. 
 My comfort, my shelter, 
 Tower of refuge and strength; 
 Let every breath,  all that I am 
 Never cease to worship You, Lord. 
 Shout to the Lord, all the earth, 
 Let us sing 
 Power and majesty, praise to the King; 
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar 
 At the sound of Your name. 
 I sing for joy at the works of Your hands, 
 Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand, 
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You. 
 Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing 
 Power and majesty, praise to the King; 
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar 
 At the sound of Your name. 
 I sing for joy at the works of Your hands, 
 Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand, 
 Nothing compares to the promise I have 
 Nothing compares to the promise I have 
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You

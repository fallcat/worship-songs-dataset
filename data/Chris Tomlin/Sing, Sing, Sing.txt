 And make music with the Heavens 
 We will sing, sing, sing

 When we shout Your praise 
 Lift high the name of Jesus 
 What's not to love about You?

 Kings and kingdoms bow down

 You are the love that frees us 
 You are the light that leads us 
 Like a fire burning 
 Son of God, You are the One 
 You are the One 
 We're living for 
 Sing, sing, sing 
 And make music with the Heavens 
 We will sing, sing, sing 
 Grateful that You hear us 
 When we shout Your praise

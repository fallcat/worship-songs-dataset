Sovereign in the mountain air 
 Sovereign on the ocean floor 
 With me in the calm 
 With me in the storm 
 Sovereign in my greatest joy 
 Sovereign In my deepest cry 
 With me in the dark 
 With me at the dawn 
 In Your everlasting arm 
 All the pieces of my life 
 From beginning to the end 
 I can trust You 
 In Your never failing love 
 You work everything for good 
 God whatever comes my way 
 I will trust You

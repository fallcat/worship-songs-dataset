Shining wonders, fields of splendor 
 How they sing Your symphony 
 The deepest oceans, rising mountains 
 How they sing Your symphony 
 Let the earth fear the Lord 
 And all the people of the world 
 Stand in awe, stand in awe 
 My heart's ovation, Yours forever 
 I will sing, sing Your praise 
 Let every nation under heaven 
 Shout Your name, sing Your praise 
 In symphony with all created things 
 Sing the song that we were made to sing 
 We stand in awe, we stand in awe 
 All the angels, all the heavens 
 Every people, every nation 
 Crying out to You 
 In the skies and in the oceans 
 Everything that's living, breathing 
 A symphony to You 
 There will be no greater song 
 In the heights above or the earth below 
 Jesus, all for You

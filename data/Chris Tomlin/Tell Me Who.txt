Tell me who, who, who 
 Can do the things You do 
 Ain't nobody now 
 Ain't nobody never 
 Tell me who put the sun and stars in place 
 Who-put the outer into space 
 Who-put a nose on every face 
 Who-put a wave on every sea 
 Who-put the breath in you and me 
 Who-put the sting in the bumblebee 
 Tell me who-put the warm in the fire's glow 
 Who-put the cold in the winter snow 
 Who-put the wet in H2O 
 Who-put the bang in the thundercloud 
 Who-put the groundhog in the ground 
 Who-put the milk in the farmer's cow

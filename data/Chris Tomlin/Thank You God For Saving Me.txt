What can I give to you 
 What can I offer to the king 
 For all the love you've shown 
 For all your mercy over me 
 I called your name, you heard my cry 
 Out of the grave, and into life 
 My heart is yours, my soul is free 
 Thank you God for saving me 
 The rock of salvation 
 My hope is built on nothing less 
 Morning by morning 
 How great is your faithfulness 
 You have your life upon the cross 
 You suffered once for all 
 You made a way 
 Jesus in victory you rose 
 You made us all your own 
 Now we are saved

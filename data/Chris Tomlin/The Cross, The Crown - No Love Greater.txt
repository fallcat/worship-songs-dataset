God in our likeness 
 For nothing less than love 
 Our Judge became our Savior 
 To make a way for us 
 The cross the crown 
 The blood falling down 
 The love that cost 
 A price greater than 
 All we could pay 
 Who can stand as righteous 
 A sinner saved by grace 
 The wrath of God was crucified 
 When Jesus took our place 
 The cross the crown 
 The blood falling down 
 The love that cost 
 A price greater than 
 All we could pay

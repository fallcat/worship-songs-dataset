I've seen Your goodness, I've known Your mercy 
 Countless times before 
 I've felt the thunder, I've heard the whisper 
 The voice that calms the storm 
 When the world is shaken, You're my firm foundation 
 Be still, be still my soul 
 The God I know, will make a way 
 Whatever comes, whatever I face 
 The God I know, is strong to save 
 He is the Lord, He conquered the grave 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 I remember, when the waters parted 
 How You led me through 
 And all I've needed, You have provided 
 Your promises are true 
 When the world is shaken, You're my firm foundation 
 Be still, be still my soul 
 The God I know, will make a way 
 Whatever comes, whatever I face 
 The God I know, is strong to save 
 He is the Lord, He conquered the grave 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 Yeah I know You're working all things, for my good 
 The God I know, will make a way 
 Whatever comes, whatever I face 
 The God I know, is strong to save 
 He is the Lord, He conquered the grave 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 And this is the God I know-ow 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 And I know You're working all things, for my good 
 The God I know, will make a way 
 Whatever comes, whatever I face 
 The God I know, is strong to save 
 He is the Lord, He conquered the grave 
 He conquered the grave...

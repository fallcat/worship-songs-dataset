The name of Jesus is a refuge 
 A shelter from the storm 
 A help to those who call 
 The name of Jesus is a fortress 
 A saving place to run 
 A hope unshakeable 
 When we fall You are the Savior 
 When we call You are the answer 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 In the name of Jesus 
 There is life and healing 
 Chains are broken in Your name 
 Every knee will bow down and our hearts will cry out 
 Songs of freedom in Your name, oh, in Your name 
 Bring salvation 
 Bring Your Kingdom 
 Let all that You have made bring glory to Your name 
 When we fall You are the Savior 
 When we call You are the answer 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 In the name of Jesus 
 There is life and healing 
 Chains are broken in Your name 
 Every knee will bow down and our hearts will cry out 
 Songs of freedom in Your name, oh, in Your name 
 Every chain 
 Broken away 
 In Your name 
 When we fall You are the Savior 
 When we call You are the answer 
 When we fall You are the Savior 
 When we call You are the answer 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 There is power in Your name 
 In the name of Jesus 
 There is life and healing 
 Chains are broken in Your name 
 Every knee will bow down and our hearts will cry out 
 Songs of freedom in Your name, oh, in Your name 
 There is power 
 There is power in Your name

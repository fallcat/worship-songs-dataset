Passion: The Road To OneDay album version: 
 This is the noise we make 
 With our voice and with our hands 
 We've come to celebrate all across this land 
 Yeah, yeah 
 The joy that's in our hearts 
 Makes us want to dance for You 
 Join as the angels sing 
 And worship as they do 
 And we worship You alone with our songs of praise 
 One day before Your throne this is the nose we'll make

 With our voice and with our hands 
 We've come to celebrate all across this land 
 Yeah, yeah 
 The joy that's in our hearts 
 Makes us want to dance for You 
 Join as the angels sing 
 And worship as they do 
 And we worship You alone with our songs of praise

 Spoken: 
 Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. 
 They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. 
 In a loud voice they sang: 
 "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, 
 To receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength 
 And honor and glory and praise!" 
 Spoken: 
 Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: 
 "To him who sits onto the throne and to the Lamb 
 Be praise and honor and glory and power, 
 For ever and ever!" 
 "Amen." 
 Spoken: 
 It's your turn, we're joining in with the angels 
 Ten thousand times ten thousand 
 Encircling the throne 
 We're joining in with them 
 You are worthy, worthy

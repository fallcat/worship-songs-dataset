I believe every heart needs a healer 
 Someone to walk through the fire 
 All I need, I have found 
 Everyone is looking for a savior 
 When it feels like the worlds going under 
 All I need, I have found 
 In my life, Jesus 
 More of you, Jesus 
 You are the one, you are the one 
 In everything, Jesus 
 My heart sings, Jesus 
 You are the one, you are the only one 
 Everyday there's a hope to remember 
 Yesterdays been washed in the water 
 All I need I have found 
 In my life, Jesus 
 More of you, Jesus 
 You are the one, you are the one 
 In everything, Jesus 
 My heart sings, Jesus 
 You are the one, you are the only one 
 I believe ever heart needs a healer 
 Someone to walk through the fire 
 I have found 
 In my life, Jesus 
 More of You, Jesus 
 You are the one, You are the one 
 In everything, Jesus 
 My heart sings, Jesus 
 You are the one, You are the only one 
 You are the one, You are the only one

When I was held up in chains 
 The river was free 
 When I was covered in stains 
 The river was clean 
 When I was losing my way 
 The river found me 
 And I can see the river 
 I can feel the river 
 I'm letting go of all I hold onto 
 Let it wash away 
 When we were broken inside 
 The river was love 
 When we were thirsty and dry 
 You were more than enough 
 When we were drowning in lies 
 The river saved us 
 And I can see the river 
 I can feel the river 
 I'm letting go of all I hold onto 
 Let it wash away 
 I'm dancing in the river 
 And I'll be here forever 
 I'm letting go of everything but You 
 Carry me away 
 Carry me away... 
 Carry me away... 
 Carry me away... 
 Carry me away... 
 Carry me away... 
 And I can see the river 
 It's washing me away 
 My life is in the river 
 And I'll be here forever 
 I'm letting go of all I hold onto 
 Can you see the river? 
 We're standing in the river 
 Letting go of everything, everything but You

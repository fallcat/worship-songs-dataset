I waited for the Lord 
 He turned and heard my cry 
 His mercy opened up my eyes 
 When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah 
 I heard the voice that calms the raging sea 
 He came to me, came to me 
 When I needed the Lord 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah 
 I waited for the Lord 
 He appeared in blinding light 
 He led me through the darkest night 
 When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah 
 I heard the voice that calms the raging sea 
 He came to me, came to me 
 When I needed the Lord 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah 
 I lifted my hands 
 He lifted me out 
 All praise to the Savior, all worship to God 
 With all that I am 
 With all in my heart 
 All praise to the Savior, all worship to God 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah 
 I heard the voice that calms the raging sea 
 He came to me, came to me 
 When I needed the Lord 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah 
 You came to me, came to me 
 When I needed You, Lord 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah 
 I heard the roar of the lion of Judah

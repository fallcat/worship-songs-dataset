I will feast at the table of the Lord 
 I will feast at the table of the Lord 
 I won't hunger anymore 
 At His table 
 Come all you weary; come and find 
 His yoke is easy; His burden light 
 He is able; He will restore 
 At the table of the Lord 
 There is peace at the table of the Lord 
 There is peace at the table of the Lord 
 I won't worry anymore 
 At His table 
 There is healing at the table of the Lord 
 There is healing at the table of the Lord 
 I won't suffer anymore 
 At His table 
 Come all you weary; come and find 
 His yoke is easy; His burden light 
 He is able; He will restore 
 At the table of the Lord 
 I know He has a place for me 
 Oh, what joy will fill my heart 
 With the saints around the mercy seat of God 
 Come all you weary; come and find 
 His yoke is easy; his burden light 
 He is able; He will restore 
 At the table of the Lord 
 At the table of the Lord 
 I'm invited to the table of the Lord 
 I'm invited to the table of the Lord 
 He says, "Come just as you are" 
 To His table

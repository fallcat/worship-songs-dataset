Caught in the half-light, I'm caught alone 
 Waking up to the sunrise and the radio 
 Feels like I'm tied up, what's holding me? 
 Just praying today will be the day I go free 
 And I want to live like there's no tomorrow 
 I want to dance like no one's around 
 I want to sing like nobody's listening 
 Before I lay my body down 
 And I want to give like I have plenty 
 I want to love like I'm not afraid 
 I want to be the man I was meant to be 
 I want to be the way I was made 
 Made in Your likeness, made with Your hands 
 Made to discover who You are and who I am 
 And all I've forgotten help me to find 
 And all that You've promised let it be in my life 
 And I want to live like there's no tomorrow 
 I want to dance like no one's around 
 I want to sing like nobody's listening 
 Before I lay my body down 
 And I want to give like I have plenty 
 I want to love like I'm not afraid 
 I want to be the man I was meant to be 
 I want to be the way I was made 
 Oh, the way I was made 
 Oh, I want to live like there's no tomorrow 
 I want to dance like no one's around 
 I want to sing like nobody's listening 
 Before I lay my body down 
 I want to give like I have plenty 
 I want to love like I'm not afraid 
 I want to be the man I was meant to be 
 I want to be the way I was made 
 I want to be the way I was made 
 I want to be the way I was made

When I survey the wondrous cross 
 On which the Prince of Glory died, 
 My richest gain I count but loss, 
 And pour contempt on all my pride. 
 See, from His head, His hands, His feet 
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down 
 Did ever such love and sorrow meet 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 
 O the wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die 
 And find that I may truly live 
 O the wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here 
 By grace draw near and bless Your name 
 Were the whole realm of nature mine 
 That were an offering far too small 
 Love so amazing, so divine 
 Demands my soul, my life, my all. 
 O the wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die 
 And find that I may truly live 
 O the wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here 
 By grace draw near and bless Your name 
 O the wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die 
 And find that I may truly live 
 Love so amazing, so divine 
 Demands my soul, my life, my all. 
 As the beauty and the shame 
 As the glory and the pain 
 Wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die (wonderful, wonderful) 
 And find that I may truly live 
 O the wonderful cross 
 O the wonderful cross (On which the Prince of Glory died) 
 All who gather here by grace draw near 
 And bless Your name 
 O the wonderful cross (did ever such love and sorrow) 
 O the wonderful cross (As the beauty and the shame) 
 Bids me come and die 
 And find that I may truly live

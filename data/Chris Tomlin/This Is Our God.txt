A refuge for the poor, a shelter from the storm 
 This is our God 
 He will wipe away your tears and return your wasted years 
 This is our God 
 Oh... this is our God 
 A father to the orphan, a healer to the broken 
 This is our God 
 And he brings peace to our madness and comfort in our sadness 
 This is our God 
 Oh... this is our God 
 This is the one we have waited for 
 Oh... this is our God 
 A fountain for the thirsty, a lover for the lonely 
 This is our God 
 He brings glory to the humble and crowns for the faithful 
 This is our God

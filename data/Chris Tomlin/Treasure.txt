I give my heart to what I treasure; 
 My devotion, everything I am. 
 Like a diamond, You treat me like I'm precious; 
 To be Yours is more than I deserve. 
 Jesus, You are my treasure; 
 Jesus, nothing less will do. 
 Jesus, I am Yours forever; 
 Jesus, I want to live for You. 
 We are a people holy to our Saviour; 
 For this moment He has gathered us 
 To bring hope and healing to the nations, 
 Till His name is known in all the earth.

Holy Uncreated One 
 Your beauty fills the skies 
 But the glory of Your majesty 
 Is the mercy in Your eyes 
 Worthy Uncreated One 
 From heaven to earth come down 
 You laid aside Your royalty 
 To wear the sinner's crown 
 O Great God, be glorified 
 Our lives laid down 
 Yours magnified 
 O Great God, be lifted high 
 There is none like You 
 Jesus, Savior, God's own Son 
 Risen, reigning Lord 
 Sustainer of the universe 
 By the power of Your word 
 O Great God, be glorified 
 Our lives laid down 
 Yours magnified 
 O Great God, be lifted high 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 And when we see Your matchless face 
 In speechless awe we'll stand 
 And there we'll bow with grateful hearts 
 Unto the Great I Am 
 O Great God, be glorified 
 Our lives laid down 
 Yours magnified 
 O Great God, be lifted high 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You

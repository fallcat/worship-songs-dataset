I will dance I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing Lord is hindering the passion in my soul 
 I will dance I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing Lord is hindering the passion in my soul 
 I will dance I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing Lord is hindering the passion in my soul 
 I will dance I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing Lord is hindering the passion in my soul 
 And I'll become even more undignified than this, 
 Some would say it's foolishness but, 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 I will dance I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing Lord is hindering the passion in my soul 
 I will dance I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing Lord is hindering the passion in my soul 
 And I'll become even more undignified than this, 
 Some would say it's foolishness but, 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Leave my pride by my side 
 And I'll become even more undignified than this, 
 Some would say it's foolishness but, 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Leave my pride by my side, yeah 
 And I'll become even more undignified than this, 
 Some would say it's foolishness but, 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Leave my pride by my side

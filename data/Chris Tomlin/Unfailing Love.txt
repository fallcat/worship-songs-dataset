You have my heart 
 And I am Yours forever 
 You are my strength 
 God of grace and power 
 And everything 
 You hold in Your hand 
 Still You make time for me 
 I can't understand 
 Praise You God of earth and sky 
 How beautiful is Your unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 And You never change, God, You remain 
 The Holy One and my unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 You are my rock 
 The One I hold on to 
 You are my song 
 And I sing for You 
 And everything 
 You hold in Your hand 
 Still You make time for me 
 I can't understand 
 Praise You God of earth and sky 
 How beautiful is Your unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 And You never change, God, You remain 
 The Holy One and my unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 And everything 
 You hold in Your hand 
 Still You make time for me 
 I can't understand 
 Praise You God of earth and sky 
 How beautiful is Your unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 And You never change, God, You remain 
 The Holy One and my unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 I will praise (praise You) You God of earth and sky 
 How beautiful is Your unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 And You never change, God, You remain 
 The Holy One and my unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 Unfailing love 
 You are unfailing 
 My Unfailing love 
 How beautiful 
 Unfailing love

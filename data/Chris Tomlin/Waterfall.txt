Oh God, my God I seek You 
 I wanna move when You move 
 You're more than I could long for 
 I thirst for You 
 You're an ocean to my soul 
 To my soul 
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall 
 Running wild and free 
 You hear my heart when I call, when I call 
 Deep calls, too deep 
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall 
 Raining down on me 
 Waterfall, waterfall 
 Oh God, my God I seek You 
 In this dry and desert land 
 You lead me to streams of mercy 
 Once again 
 You're an ocean to my soul 
 To my soul 
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall 
 Running wild and free 
 You hear my heart when I call, when I call 
 Deep calls, too deep 
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall 
 Raining down on me 
 Waterfall, waterfall 
 It's coming like a flood 
 I'm dancing in the rain 
 Everything I've done 
 Is covered in rivers of grace, amazing 
 It's coming like a flood 
 I'm dancing in the rain 
 I lift up my hands 
 Your love never changes, amazing 
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall 
 Running wild and free 
 You hear my heart when I call, when I call 
 Deep calls, too deep 
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall 
 Raining down on me 
 Waterfall, waterfall

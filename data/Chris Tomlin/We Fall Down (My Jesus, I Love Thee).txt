We fall down 
 We lay our crowns 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 The greatness of 
 Mercy and love 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 Is the lamb 
 We fall down 
 We lay our crowns 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 The greatness of 
 Mercy and love 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 Is the lamb 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 Is the lamb 
 My Jesus, I love Thee 
 I know Thou art mine 
 To Thee all the follies of sin I resign 
 My gracious redeemer 
 My Savior, art Thou 
 If ever I'll love Thee 
 My Jesus 'tis now

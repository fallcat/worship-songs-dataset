 We fall down 
 We lay our crowns 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 The greatness of 
 Mercy and love 
 At the feet of Jesus

 Spoken: 
 Last fall we were in Africa, 
 And in just a minute we're going to call Botswana, Africa 
 And they're gathered around with us, and uh listening in 
 And as we were there, in Africa, they taught me this song back 
 They said, 'We want to teach it to you in our language, which is Setswana.' 
 And it's very, very simple.  And I want to teach it to you. 
 And we're going to call them in a minute, and the first thing they're going to hear 
 Is you guys singing, is this song to them in their language, all right. 
 It's going to be beautiful. 
 It's like this: 
 Re o bama 
 Re I koba 
 Naong tsp go Jesu 
 Lo lorato 
 Le legolo 
 Naong tsp go Jesu 
 O boitshepo, boitshepo 
 O boitshepo, boitshepo 
 O boitshepo, boitshepo 
 O kwana

 Re o bama 
 Re I koba 
 Naong tsp go Jesu

 Naong tsp go Jesu 
 O boitshepo, boitshepo

 O boitshepo, boitshepo

 O kwana 
 Spoken: 
 And now, Father, we rise up 
 And we say salvation spring up from the ground 
 Lord, rend the heavens and come down 
 Seek the lost, and heal the lame.

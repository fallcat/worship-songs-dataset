What Child is this who laid to rest 
 On Mary's lap is sleeping 
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet 
 While shepherds watch are keeping? 
 This, this is Christ the King 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing! 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud 
 The Babe the Son of Mary 
 So bring Him incense gold and myrrh 
 Come peasant King to own Him 
 The King of kings salvation brings, 
 Let loving hearts Enthrone Him 
 Raise, raise a a song on high! 
 The virgin sings her lullaby 
 Joy, joy for Christ is born 
 The Babe, the Son of Mary! 
 This, this is Christ the King 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing! 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud 
 The Babe the Son of Mary 
 Nails, spears shall pierce Him through 
 The Cross He bore for me, for you 
 Hail, hail the Word made flesh the Babe 
 The Son of Mary

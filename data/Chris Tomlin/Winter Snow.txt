Could've come like a mighty storm 
 With all the strength of a hurricane 
 You could've come like a forest fire 
 With the power of Heaven in Your flame 
 But You came like a winter snow 
 Quiet and soft and slow 
 Falling from the sky in the night 
 To the Earth below 
 Could've swept in like a tidal wave 
 Or an ocean to ravish our hearts 
 You could have come through like a roaring flood 
 To wipe away the things we've scarred 
 Oh, but You came like a winter snow 
 Yes, You did 
 You were quiet You were soft and slow 
 Falling from the sky in the night 
 To the Earth below 
 No, Your voice wasn't in a bush burning 
 No, Your voice wasn't in a rushing wind 
 It was still, it was small, it was hidden 
 You came like a winter snow 
 Quiet and soft and slow 
 Falling from the sky in the night 
 To the Earth below 
 Falling to the Earth below 
 You came falling from the sky in the night 
 To the Earth below

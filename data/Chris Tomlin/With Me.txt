I open my mouth and You speak for me 
 You move the mountains and roll back the sea 
 And I will not be afraid 
 I will never be ashamed 
 For You are with me 
 You are with me 
 And I've seen enough to know 
 That You're my only hope 
 I don't want to go 
 If You're not with me 
 If You're not with me 
 We open our hands and You reach for us 
 You are the motion of the universe 
 And I will not be afraid 
 I will never be ashamed 
 For You are with me 
 You are with me 
 And I've seen enough to know 
 That You're my only hope 
 I don't want to go 
 If You're not with me 
 I've seen enough to know 
 That You're my only hope 
 I don't want to go 
 If You're not with me 
 If You're not with me 
 I open my mouth and You speak for me 
 You move the mountains and roll back the sea 
 I've seen enough to know 
 That You're my only hope 
 I don't want to go 
 And I've seen enough to know 
 That You're my only hope 
 I don't want to go 
 If You're not with me 
 If You're not with me 
 And I will not be afraid 
 I will not be afraid 
 No, I will not be afraid 
 I will not be afraid 
 I will not be afraid 
 I will not be afraid 
 Because You are with me

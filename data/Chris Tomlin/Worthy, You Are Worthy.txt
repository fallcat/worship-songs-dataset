Worthy, You are worthy 
 Much more worthy than I know 
 I cannot imagine 
 Just how glorious You are 
 And I cannot begin to tell 
 How deep a love You bring 
 O Lord my ears have heard of You 
 But now my eyes have seen 
 You're worthy 
 You're worthy 
 You're worthy 
 You're worthy to be praised 
 Forever and a day 
 Glory, I give glory 
 To the One who saved my soul 
 You found me and You freed me 
 From the shame that was my own 
 And I cannot begin to tell 
 How merciful You've been 
 O Lord, my ears had heard of You 
 But now my eyes have seen 
 We'll sing an anthem of the highest praise 
 We'll sound an anthem of Your glorious name

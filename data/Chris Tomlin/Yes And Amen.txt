Father of kindness, 
 You have poured out of grace 
 You brought me out of darkness, 
 You have filled me with peace 
 Giver of mercy,

 Faithful, you are, 
 Faithful forever you will be 
 Faithful, you are, 
 All your promises are yes and Amen 
 All your promises are yes and Amen 
 Beautiful Saviour, 
 You have brought me near 
 You pulled me from the ashes, 
 You have broken every curse 
 Blessed redeemer, 
 You have set this captive free 
 Lord, I can't help but sing 
 Faithful, you are, 
 Faithful forever you will be 
 Faithful, you are, 
 All your promises are yes and Amen 
 All your promises are yes and Amen 
 Faithful, you are, 
 Faithful forever you will be 
 Faithful, yes, you are, 
 All your promises are yes and Amen 
 I will rest in your promises 
 My confidence is your faithfulness 
 I will rest in your promises 
 My confidence is your faithfulness 
 I will rest in your promises 
 My confidence is your faithfulness 
 I will rest in your promises 
 My confidence is your faithfulness 
 Faithful, you are,

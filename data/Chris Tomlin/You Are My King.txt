I'm forgiven - spoken 
 And I'm forgiven because You were forsaken 
 And I'm accepted, You were condemned 
 And I'm alive and well 
 Your Spirit is within me 
 Because You died and rose again 
 Hallelujah, Jesus - spoken 
 Amazing love, how can it be 
 That You, my King, would die for me? 
 Amazing love, I know it's true 
 Now it's my joy to honor You 
 Amazing love - spoken 
 Amazing love, how can it be 
 That You, my King, would die for me? 
 I know it's true - spoken 
 Amazing love, I know it's true 
 Now it's my joy to honor You 
 In all I do I honor You 
 Spoken: 
 Only the Holy Spirit and the kindness of a mighty God leads us to repentance. 
 And I want to ask Him if He will lead us now 
 To places of truth, where we stop pretending, 
 And we honestly come before the living God. 
 That we don't drive by, but we park 
 And we bow down at the foot of the cross of Christ. 
 And I'm forgiven because You were forsaken 
 And I'm accepted, You were condemned 
 And I'm alive and well 
 Your Spirit is within me 
 Because You died and rose again 
 Amazing love, how can it be 
 That You, my King, would die for me? 
 Amazing love, I know it's true 
 Now it's my joy to honor You 
 In all I do 
 Spoken: 
 If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, 
 Who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness; 
 Therefore you are feared. 
 I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, 
 And in his word I put my hope. 
 My soul waits for the Lord 
 More than watchmen wait for the morning. 
 Put your hope in the Lord, 
 For with the Lord is unfailing love 
 And with him is full redemption. 
 Spoken: 
 But he was wounded for our transgressions, 
 He was bruised for our iniquities; 
 The chastisement that brought us peace was upon him, 
 And by his stripes we are healed. 
 All we, like sheep, have gone astray, 
 Each of us has turned to his own way; 
 But God hath laid upon him 
 The iniquity of us all. 
 Spoken: 
 There is therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, 
 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. 
 God, we thank You for the cross of Jesus Christ. 
 You are my King 
 You are my King 
 Jesus, You are my King 
 You are my King 
 Just fill the skies with that praise - spoken 
 You are my King 
 You are my King 
 You are my King 
 You are my King 
 Lift it up - spoken 
 If the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 If the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 Yeah 
 If the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 Oh, if the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 Come on, sing it - spoken 
 If the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 Oh, if the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 If the Son has set you free, you are really free 
 If the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 If the Son - spoken 
 If the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 Oh, if the Son has set you free, you are free indeed 
 Hallelujah 
 You are free indeed 
 You are free indeed 
 You are free indeed 
 You are free 
 Amazing love - spoken 
 Amazing love, how can it be 
 That You, my King, would die for me? 
 Amazing love, I know it's true 
 Now it's my joy to honor You 
 Amazing love - spoken 
 Amazing love, how can it be 
 That You, my King, would die for me? 
 Amazing love, I know it's true 
 Now it's my joy to honor You 
 In all I do I honor You 
 Spoken until the end: 
 God, we sow these prayers of faith in Jesus Christ 
 That in this awesome generation of students 
 These lovers of God, these passionate seekers of Your heart, 
 These radical followers of Jesus 
 And we say to You, God, by the power of the Holy Spirit, 
 Would You cause them to live lives that are as big as You are, God, 
 To dream dreams that are as big as You are, God, 
 To have visions that are as big as You are, God, 
 That in no way their lives would ever from this moment belittle You in any way, 
 That they would represent and say we are the people of God, He is our God, 
 And we are His people. 
 God, we pray in the name of Jesus, and thank You that You've broken every chain, 
 And every curse off of their lives, and freed them by the blood of Jesus Christ 
 I thank You, God, that they are Yours, 
 God, I pray that You would take us, and give us the holy privilege 
 Of finishing the task of taking the name of Jesus to every person on this planet 
 So that the King, the Son of God, can return to this earth and take us to our rightful place. 
 God, we commend our lives to You 
 Until the nations come and worship You.

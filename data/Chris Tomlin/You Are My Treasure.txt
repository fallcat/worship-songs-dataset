I'm created for You alone 
 Bought with a price I'm not my own 
 I'm seated in the heavenlies 
 And there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 I'm created for You alone 
 Bought with a price I'm not my own 
 I'm seated in the heavenlies 
 And there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 You are my treasure 
 Faithful Lord, fill my cup 
 With your grace and love, Your grace and love 
 The pleasures that this world's sure of 
 Will never be enough, can never be enough 
 'Cause I'm created for You alone 
 Bought with a price I'm not my own 
 I'm seated in the heavenlies 
 And there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 You are my treasure 
 Faithful Lord, fill my cup 
 With your grace and love, Your grace and love 
 The pleasures that this world's sure of 
 They will never be enough, can never be enough 
 'Cause I'm created for You alone 
 Bought with a price I'm not my own 
 I'm seated in the heavenlies 
 And there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 You are my treasure 
 I'm created for You alone 
 Bought with a price I'm not my own 
 I'm seated in the heavenlies 
 And there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 Than with You forever Lord 
 You are my treasure 
 You are my treasure 
 You are my treasure 
 You are my treasure

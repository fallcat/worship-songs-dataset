Mountain maker 
 Ocean tamer 
 Glimpses of You 
 Burn in my eyes 
 The worship of heaven 
 Fills up the skies 
 You made it all 
 Said, "let there be" 
 And there was 
 All that we see 
 The sound of Your voice 
 The works of Your hands 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things well 
 Star creator 
 Wind breather 
 The strokes of Your beauty 
 Brushed through the clouds 
 Light from the heavens 
 Touching the ground 
 And You made it all 
 Said, "let there be" 
 And there was 
 All that we see 
 The sound of Your voice 
 The works of Your hands 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things well 
 Imagination runs wild 
 And breathes the breath of life 
 Across the field 
 Across the miles 
 You made it all 
 Said, "let there be" 
 And there was 
 All that we see 
 The sound of Your voice 
 The works of Your hands 
 You do all things well 
 You made it all 
 Said, "let there be" 
 And there was 
 All that we see 
 The sound of Your voice 
 The works of Your hands 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things well

Your turned my way 
 You heard my cry 
 You turned my mourning into shouting 
 Sorrow may last for a night 
 But with the light I am seeing 
 I am singing 
 You lifted me out 
 You lifted me out 
 And set me dancing, dancing 
 Free, now I am free 
 Your love rescued me 
 Now it's the anthem I'm singing 
 Many will see 
 Many will hear 
 And find You strong enough to save 
 Many the wonders You have done 
 Your light has come, and I am singing 
 I am singing 
 You lifted me out 
 You lifted me out 
 And set me dancing, dancing 
 Free, now I am free 
 Your love rescued me 
 Now it's the anthem I'm singing 
 Lost is where You found me 
 Shattered and frail 
 But You love me still 
 Trouble may surround me 
 My heart may fail 
 But You never will 
 You never will 
 You lifted me out 
 You lifted me out 
 And set me dancing, dancing 
 Free, now I am free 
 Your love rescued me 
 Now it's the anthem I'm singing

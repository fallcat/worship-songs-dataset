From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea 
 Creation's revealing Your majesty 
 From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring 
 Every creature unique in the song that it sings 
 All exclaiming 
 Indescribable, uncontainable, 
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name. 
 You are amazing God 
 All powerful, untameable, 
 Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim 
 You are amazing God 
 Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go 
 Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow 
 Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light 
 Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night 
 None can fathom 
 Indescribable, uncontainable, 
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name 
 You are amazing God 
 All powerful, untameable, 
 Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim 
 You are amazing God 
 You are amazing God 
 Indescribable, uncontainable, 
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name. 
 You are amazing God 
 All powerful, untameable, 
 Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim 
 You are amazing God 
 Indescribable, uncontainable, 
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name. 
 You are amazing God 
 Incomparable, unchangeable 
 You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same 
 You are amazing God 
 You are amazing God

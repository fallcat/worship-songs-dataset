I heard Your song coming over the hill 
 I know it seemed like the world stood still 
 You were singin' a melody that caught me by surprise 
 Yeah it sounded familiar to me, like I'd known it all my life 
 And I keep looking down as I move in closer 
 My heart is racing now with fear and wonder 
 Could I come back to You so long on my own 
 From where I am, I know this is not my home 
 You're the one I believe 
 A king and friend has always been holding onto me 
 You're the one that I have seen 
 Your life and death the endless breath breathing into me 
 Just the mention of Your name 
 And I know, I know I've found love 
 'Cause You're the one 
 High in a hidden world is where You are found 
 Where every living thing circles around 
 I find myself again where I used to be 
 With the rescued ones falling on my knees 
 'Cause You're the one I believe 
 A king and friend has always been holding onto me 
 You're the one that I have seen 
 Your life and death the endless breath breathing into me 
 Just the mention of Your name 
 And I know, I know I've found love 
 'Cause You're the one 
 In Your presence there is mercy 
 In the fear, joy and the tears 
 It's Your goodness that keeps on keeps on 
 Calling us here, drawing us near 
 'Cause You're the one I believe 
 A king and friend has always been holding onto me 
 You're the one that I have seen 
 Your life and death the endless breath breathing into me 
 You're the one I believe 
 A king and friend has always been holding onto me 
 You're the one that I have seen 
 Your life and death breath into me 
 Just the mention of Your name 
 And I know, I know I've found love 
 'Cause You're the one 
 You're the one 
 You're the one 
 You're the one

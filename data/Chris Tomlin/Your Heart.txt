It never was about the oil dripping from my head 
 I never did dream beyond the pastures I could tend 
 It never was about the praise, not about the street parade 
 I didn't really need a crowd when Goliath fell down 
 I never meant to woo a king with simple shepherd songs 
 Or hide away inside a cave, safe from danger's arms 
 I never meant to wear a crown or try to bring armies down 
 It never was about me and who I hoped to be 
 At the end of the day I wanna hear people say 
 My heart looks like Your heart, my heart looks like Your heart 
 When the world looks at me, let them agree 
 That my heart looks like Your heart, my heart looks like Your heart 
 I never thought I would be much more than Jesse's kin 
 Who would ever dream a king would come from Bethlehem? 
 I know that I've crashed and burned, their lives have been overturned 
 But You redeem everything, yeah, even me 
 At the end of the day I want to hear people say 
 That my heart looks like Your heart, my heart looks like Your heart 
 When the world looks at me, I pray all they see 
 Is my heart looks like Your heart, my heart looks like Your heart 
 Five little stones or a royal robe 
 Shepherd or king doesn't mean a thing 
 'Cause at the end of the day 
 At the end of the day I wanna hear people say 
 That my heart looks like Your heart, my heart looks like Your heart 
 Unashamed I will dance, in Your name, lift my hands 
 'Til my heart looks like Your heart, my heart looks like Your heart 
 Like Your heart 
 Like Your heart 
 Till this heart looks like Your heart

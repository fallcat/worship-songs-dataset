Our God is, a consuming fire, 
 A burning holy Flame, with glory and freedom 
 Our God is, the only righteous judge, 
 Ruling over us with kindness and wisdom 
 We will keep our eyes on You 
 We will keep our eyes on You 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 A sacred refuge is Your Name 
 Your Kingdom is unshakable 
 With You forever we will reign 
 Our God is, jealous for His own 
 None could comprehend, His love and His mercy 
 Our God is exalted on His throne 
 High above the heavens 
 Forever He's worthy... 
 We will keep our eyes on You 
 We will keep our eyes on You 
 We will keep our eyes on You 
 We will keep our eyes on You 
 So we can set our hearts on You 
 Lord we will set our hearts on You!

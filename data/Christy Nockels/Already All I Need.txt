Asking where You are Lord, wondering where You've been 
 Is like standing in a hurricane trying to find the wind 
 Hoping for Your mercy to meet me where I am 
 Is forgetting that your thoughts for me outnumber the sand 
 You fill the sun with morning light 
 You bent the moon to lead the night 
 You clothed the lillies bright and beautiful 
 You're already all I need 
 Already everything that I could hope for 
 You're already all I need 
 You've already set me, already making me more like you 
 You're already all I need 
 Jesus, You're already all I need. 
 Walking through this life without your freedom in my heart 
 Is like holding onto shackles that You have torn apart 
 So remind me of your promises and all that You have done 
 In this world I will have trouble, but You have overcome 
 And every gift that I receive, You determined just for me 
 But nothing I desire compares to You 
 In your fullness, You're my all in all 
 In your healing, I'm forever made whole 
 In your freedom, Your love overflows and carries me 
 You carry me, yes You carry me, You carry me

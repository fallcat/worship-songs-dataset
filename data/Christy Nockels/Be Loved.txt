Have you ever let yourself be loved 
 By the one who made You 
 Have you ever told your soul to believe 
 That His heart is on your side 
 You could even try to run away 
 But there's nothing you can do 
 Just be loved 
 Be loved, He loves you 
 Just be loved 
 Be loved, He loves you 
 Have you ever let yourself be held 
 By the one who holds this world 
 Have you ever told your soul to rejoice 
 That His arms are open wide 
 You could even try to run away 
 But He'd come running after you 
 Just be held 
 Be held, He holds you 
 Just be held 
 Be held, He holds you 
 We didn't earn it 
 He just chose to give it 
 And it's in our resting 
 That we rise up singing 
 Rejoice, again, I say rejoice 
 Rejoice, again, I say rejoice 
 You are loved 
 Be loved, He loves you 
 You are loved 
 Be loved, He loves you

Brothers, let us come together 
 Walking in the Spirit, there's much to be done... 
 We will come reaching, out from our comforts 
 And they will know us by our love... 
 Sisters, we were made for kindness 
 We can pierce the darkness as He shines through us... 
 We will come reaching, with a song of healing... 
 And they will know us by our love 
 The time is now 
 Come Church arise... 
 Love with His hands 
 See with His eyes... 
 Bind it around you 
 Let it never leave you 
 And they will know us by our love... 
 Children, You are hope for justice 
 Stand firm in the Truth now, set your hearts above 
 You will be reaching, long after we're gone 
 And they will know you by your love

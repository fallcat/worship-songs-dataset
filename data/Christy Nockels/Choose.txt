Let me be in love with what You love 
 Let me be most satisfied in You 
 Forsaking what this world has offered me 
 I choose to be in love with You 
 I will choose to be in love with You 
 Let me know the peace that's mine in You 
 Let me know the joy my heart can sing 
 For I have nothing Lord apart from You 
 I choose to call on Christ in me 
 I will choose to call on Christ in me 
 For in the fullness of who You are 
 I can rest in this place 
 And giving over this, my journey Lord 
 I see nothing but Your face 
 Let me know that You have loved me first 
 Let me know the weight of my response 
 For You have long pursued my wandering heart 
 I choose to glory in Your cross... 
 I will choose to glory in Your cross! 
 For in the fullness of who You are 
 I can rest in this place 
 And giving over this, my journey Lord 
 I see nothing but Your face 
 And I bow down... 
 Humbly I bow down... 
 Humbly I bow down... 
 I bow down...

Up on the heights, oh, oh 
 You let me go, oh, oh 
 You make my heart to rise from the depths below 
 You hold me up, oh, oh 
 So I can see, oh, oh 
 You're ever lifting me 
 You're ever lifting me 
 You're lifting my head so I know you're near me 
 You're lifting my eyes so I see you clearly 
 Where I belong 
 You are where I belong 
 I'm lifting my voice just to sing a new song 
 I'm lifting my hands just to show you I know 
 Where I belong 
 You are where I belong 
 You are ever lifting me 
 You are ever lifting me 
 You fill my heart to know 
 The length of your great love 
 And where you go I'll go 
 You set my heart above 
 And nothing on earth compares 
 Oh, god when I'm with you 
 You take me higher 
 You take me higher.

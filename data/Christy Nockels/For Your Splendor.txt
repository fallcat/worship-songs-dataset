I'm so concerned with what I look like from the outside 
 Will I blossom into what You hope I'll be 
 Yet You're so patient just to help me see 
 The blooms come from a deeper seed that You planted in me 
 Sometimes it's hard to grow when everybody's watching 
 To have your heart pruned by the one who knows best 
 And though I'm bare and cold I know my season's coming 
 And I'll spring up in Your endless faithfulness 
 With my roots deep in You I'll grow the branch that bears the fruit 
 And though I'm small, I'll still be standing in the storm 
 'Cause I am planted by the river by Your streams of living water 
 And I'll grow up strong and beautiful, all for Your splendor, Lord 
 So with my arms stretched out, I'm swaying to Your heartbeat 
 I'm growing with the sound of Your voice calling 
 You're bringing out the beauty that You have put in me 
 For Your joy and for Your glory falling

We lift our hands in praise to You 
 We lift in our hearts in worship to You, Lord 
 We lift our voice to You and sing 
 Our greatest love will ever be You, Lord, You, Lord 
 Glorious over us 
 You shall reign, glorious 
 There is a King that we adore 
 With humble hearts we bow before You, Lord 
 There is a place we long to be 
 Face to face we long to see You, Lord, You, Lord 
 Glorious over us 
 You shall reign, glorious 
 Glorious over us 
 You shall reign, glorious 
 Majesty and power 
 Are Yours alone forever 
 Majesty and power 
 Are Yours alone forever 
 Glorious over us 
 You shall reign, glorious 
 Glorious, You are over us 
 You shall reign, glorious 
 Glorious over us 
 You shall reign, glorious

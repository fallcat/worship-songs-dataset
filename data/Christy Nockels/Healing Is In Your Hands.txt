No mountain, no valley, no gain or loss we know 
 Could keep us from Your love 
 No sickness, no secret, no chain is strong enough 
 To keep us from Your love 
 To keep us from Your love 
 How high, how wide 
 No matter where I am, healing is in Your hands 
 How deep, How strong, 
 And now by Your grace I stand, healing is in Your hands 
 Our present, our future, our past is in Your hands 
 We're covered by Your blood 
 We're covered by Your blood 
 How high, How wide 
 No matter where I am, healing is in Your hands 
 How deep, How strong 
 And now by Your grace I stand, healing is in Your hands 
 In all things we know that 
 We are more than conquerors 
 You keep us by Your love

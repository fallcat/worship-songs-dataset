I am leaning, on you Jesus 
 With all my longing, laid before you now 
 And all I've needed, is you Jesus 
 And all my wanting, you satisfied somehow 
 There is no higher worth, in all the earth 
 But to love you, how I love you 
 No greater call, no life at all 
 But to love you, how I love you 
 Jesus, you're my desire 
 Purify me, till I burn for you alone 
 There is no higher worth, in all the earth 
 But to love you, how I love you 
 No greater call, no life at all 
 But to love you, how I love you 
 No higher worth, in all the earth 
 But to love you, how I love you 
 No greater call, no life at all 
 But to love you, how I love you 
 How I love you, love you, Jesus, Jesus 
 How I love you, love you, Jesus 
 Oh how I love you, I love you 
 How I love you, love you, Jesus 
 How I love you, how I love you 
 Love you, Jesus, oh how I love you

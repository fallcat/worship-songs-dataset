Here's my life, I give it to You 
 I place it in Your hands 
 I place it in Your hands 
 Here's my heart, You're dwelling inside 
 I place it in Your hands 
 I place it in Your hands 
 For so long I have held on to all that I am 
 When all You want is for me to place it in Your hands, in your hands, Lord... in your hands... 
 Here's my thoughts, I want to think of You 
 And place them in Your hands 
 I place them in Your hands 
 Here's my time, take it as You will 
 I place it in Your hands 
 I place it in Your hands 
 For so long I have held on to all that I am 
 When all You want is for me to place it in Your hands 
 Here's my life, I give it You 
 I place it in Your hands 
 I place it in Your hands...

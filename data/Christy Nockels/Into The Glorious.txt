I was made for more than this world could offer me 
 My heart to hold true mystery 
 My voice was made to fall on holy ears 
 My life to collide with majesty 
 Out from the ordinary into extraordinary 
 This is a heart-cry from my life 
 To say I love You, God, I love You 
 So take me deeper, oh, I can hear You calling 
 Inviting me in into the glorious 
 I was made me for rest in a world that's striving 
 To lie down in the fields of green 
 To set my feet upon this holy ground 
 To build my life on the things unseen 
 Out from the ordinary into extraordinary 
 Out from the ordinary into extraordinary 
 You're calling me, You're calling me 
 And God it's a breakthrough 
 Now I can see You Inviting me, inviting me, oh

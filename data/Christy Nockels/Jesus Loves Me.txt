Jesus loves me, this I know 
 For the Bible tells me so 
 Little ones to Him belong 
 They are weak, but He is strong 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 For the Bible tells me so 
 Jesus loves me, He who died 
 Heaven's gate to open wide 
 He will wash away my sin 
 Let His little child come in 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 For the Bible tells me so 
 Jesus Loves me, He will stay 
 Close beside me all the way 
 He's prepared a home for me 
 And someday His face I'll see 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 Yes, Jesus loves me 
 He loves me, yes, Jesus loves me 
 For the Bible tells me so 
 The Bible tells me so

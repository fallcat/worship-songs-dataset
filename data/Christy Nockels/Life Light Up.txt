With You, I can go anywhere... 
 I can do anything 
 'Cause You are the song I bring... 
 With You, You are the air I breathe 
 'Cause You are my everything 
 And I am Your offering... 
 I may live and I may die 
 Either way You're glorified 
 Bless the day I give my life away! 
 Let my life light up like the city lights 
 And let it burn for You in the darkest night 
 In You, I can begin again 
 I'm part of a bigger plan 
 'Cause You are the Great I Am! 
 In You, Your life is in my veins 
 And You've broken all my chains 
 'Cause You are the God Who reigns! 
 My light will shine on earth 
 And my Father will be praised!

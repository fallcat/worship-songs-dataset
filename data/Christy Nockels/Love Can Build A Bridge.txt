I'd gladly walk across the desert 
 With no shoes upon my feet 
 To share with you the last bite 
 Of bread I had to eat 
 I would swim out to save you 
 In your sea of broken dreams 
 When all your hopes are sinking 
 Let me show you what love means 
 Love can build a bridge 
 Between your heart and mine 
 Love can build a bridge 
 Don't you think it's time? 
 Don't you think it's time? 
 I would whisper love so loudly 
 Every heart could understand 
 That love and only love 
 Can join the tribes of man 
 I would give my heart's desire 
 So that you might see 
 The first step is to realize 
 That it all begins with you and me 
 When we stand together 
 It's our finest hour 
 We can do anything, anything 
 Keep believing in the power

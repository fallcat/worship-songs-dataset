I once was fatherless 
 A stranger with no hope 
 Your kindness wakened me 
 Awakened me, from my sleep 
 Your love it beckons deeply 
 A call to come and die 
 By grace now I will come 
 And take this life, take Your life 
 Sin has lost it's power 
 Death has lost it's sting 
 From the grave you've risen 
 Victoriously 
 Into marvelous light I'm running 
 Out of darkness, out of shame 
 By the cross You are the truth 
 You are the life, You are the way 
 My dead heart now is beating 
 My deepest stains now clean 
 Your breath fills up my lungs 
 Now I'm free, now I'm free 
 Lift my hands and spin around 
 See the light that I have found 
 Oh the marvelous light 
 Marvelous light...

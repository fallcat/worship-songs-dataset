My delight is in You 
 On Your word I set my heart 
 You are peace, You are calm for my restless soul 
 You light my way through the dark 
 I want to know You even more 
 Holiness is my desire 
 Purify, burning me, come and make me clean 
 You refine me in Your fire 
 Here I am, open arms 
 Draw me close Your heart 
 You're my life, You're my refuge 
 My delight, my delight is in You 
 My delight is in You 
 My delight is in You, Lord 
 You're the treasure I have found 
 You're the rock where I stand 
 I will be moved 
 All my life is in Your hands 
 Here I am, open arms 
 Draw me close Your heart 
 You're my life, You're my refuge 
 My delight, my delight is in You 
 My delight is in You 
 Here I am, open arms 
 Draw me close Your heart 
 You're my life, You're my refuge 
 My delight, my delight is in You 
 My delight is in You 
 My delight is in You 
 My delight is in You 
 My delight is in You 
 What I found is a new love 
 All about showing you Jesus 
 Oh I found You, spring up from who you are love 
 All our days left, all our days left, Lord 
 Find us far 
 My heart toward desire 
 Is to be holy 
 Set apart for You 
 I choose to be holy 
 Set apart for You my master 
 Ready to do for You 
 Here I am, open arms 
 Draw me close Your heart 
 You're my life, You're my refuge 
 My delight, my delight is in You 
 Here I am, open arms 
 Draw me close Your heart 
 You're my life, You're my refuge 
 My delight, my delight is in You 
 My delight is in You 
 My delight is in You

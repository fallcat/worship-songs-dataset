The day You heard my plea You looked right through me 
 You saw the pit I was in, You came and pulled me out 
 You set my feet upon a rock and put a new song in my mouth 
 Then You called me Your own and I'm never turning back 
 I love my Master, I will not go free 
 I take Your name and live in liberty 
 My life is Yours forever, I'll serve You faithfully 
 I love my Master, I will not go free 
 You're a love I've never known and Your faithfulness has shown 
 No matter what I'm about You always find me out 
 And You lovingly remain age to age the same 
 And for all of my days I will tell of Your ways, Your mighty ways 
 I love my Master, I will not go free 
 I take Your name and live in liberty 
 And my life is Yours forever, I'll serve You faithfully 
 I love my Master, I will not go free, I will not go free 
 Covenant keeper You are, You are 
 Merciful kindness You are, You are 
 Passionate Father You are, You are 
 Lifeblood redeemer You are, You are 
 I love my Master, I will not go free 
 I take Your name and live in liberty 
 And my life is Yours forever, I'll serve You faithfully 
 I love my Master, I will not go free

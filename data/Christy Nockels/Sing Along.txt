From babies hidden in the shadows 
 To the cities shining bright 
 There are captives weeping 
 Far from sight 
 For every doorway has a story 
 And some are holding back the cries 
 But there is One who hears at the night 
 Great God 
 Wrap Your arms around this world tonight 
 Around the world tonight 
 And when You hear our cries 
 Sing through the night 
 So we can join in Your song 
 And sing along 
 We'll sing along 
 From the farthest corners of the earth 
 Still His mercy reaches 
 Even to the pain we cannot see 
 And even through the darkness 
 There's a promise that will keep us 
 There is One who came to set us free 
 Great God 
 Wrap Your arms around this world tonight 
 Around the world tonight 
 And when You hear our cries 
 Sing through the night 
 So we can join in Your song 
 And sing along 
 We'll sing along 
 So let Your song rise 
 And fill up the earth 
 Let Your hope ring out 
 Let Your heart be heard 
 So let Your song rise 
 And fill up the earth 
 Let Your hope ring out 
 Let Your heart be heard 
 Great God 
 Wrap Your arms around this world tonight 
 Around the world tonight 
 And when You hear our cries 
 Sing through the night 
 And we will join in Your song 
 And sing along 
 We'll sing along 
 We'll sing along (x6) 
 Great God 
 Wrap Your arms around this world tonight 
 Around the world tonight 
 And when You hear our cries 
 Sing through the night 
 And we will join in Your song 
 And sing along 
 We'll sing along 
 Great God 
 Wrap Your arms around this world tonight 
 Around the world tonight 
 And when You hear our cries 
 Sing through the night 
 And we will join in Your song 
 And sing along 
 We'll sing along

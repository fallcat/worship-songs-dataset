The broken, weary and poor 
 Finding... You are the cure 
 The weak and dying, glorifying, You in it all... 
 It's the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me... 
 It's the song of the beautiful, Jesus Saved Me... 
 The song of the redeemed, the echoes of those made free 
 It's the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me... 
 The fallen back on their feet 
 The fatherless now complete... 
 The innocent suffering, rising from wounding, to find... You were there all along 
 It's the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me... 
 It's the song of the beautiful, Jesus Saved Me... 
 The song of the redeemed, the echoes of those made free - 
 It's the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me... 
 Oh how He loves me 
 Oh how He loves me 
 Oh how He love me... 
 The broken, the beautiful... 
 The prodigal running home... 
 The widow never alone... 
 The one who is waiting, rising and singing, "You... Jesus, You Are My All!"

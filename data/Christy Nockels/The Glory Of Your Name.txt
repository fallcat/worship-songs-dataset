It was in the way You came as a lowly babe 
 That Your glory was displayed 
 And it was in the sacrifice of the purest life 
 It was in Your Father's will obeyed 
 The perfect Lamb that was slain 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 No other one, no other way for me to see, yeah 
 You took my place, You are the way 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 Yes, there's the glory of Your name 
 It was in Your victory, risen for the world to see 
 That all who would believe could enter in 
 And it is in the passionate price, now demanding all my life 
 And beating in the chambers of my heart 
 The perfect Lamb that was slain 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 No other one, no other way for me to see, yeah 
 You took my place, You are the way 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 Yes, there's the glory of Your name 
 The glory of Your name 
 There is nothing in this world 
 That could take the place of You 
 That could take the place of You, my Jesus 
 And there is nothing in this life that could take the place of 
 One life and one love and one power to save us all 
 And one hope and one truth and one glory in it all 
 One glory in it all, yeah 
 The perfect Lamb that was slain 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 No other one, no other way for me to see, yeah 
 You took my place, You are the way 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 Yes, there's the glory of Your name 
 The glory of Your name, Jesus 
 The glory, the glory of Your name

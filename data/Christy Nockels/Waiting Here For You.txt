If faith can move the mountains 
 Let the mountains move 
 We come with expectation 
 Waiting here for you, waiting here for you 
 You're the Lord of all creation 
 And still you know my heart 
 The author of salvation 
 You've loved us from the start 
 Waiting here for you 
 With our hands lifted high in praise 
 And it's you we adore 
 Singing Alleluia 
 You are everything you've promised 
 Your faithfulness is true 
 And we're desperate for your presence 
 All we need is you 
 Waiting here for you, Lord 
 With our hands lifted high in praise 
 And it's you, Lord, we adore 
 Singing Alleluia 
 We will wait for you, Lord, he'll stand with you 
 We will sing alleluia 
 Singing Alleluia, alleluia 
 Singing Alleluia, alleluia 
 Waiting here for you 
 With our hands lifted high in praise 
 And it's you we adore, we adore 
 Singing Alleluia 
 Waiting here for you 
 With our hands lifted high in praise 
 And it's you we adore 
 Singing Alleluia, singing Alleluia 
 Waiting here for you 
 With our hands lifted high in praise 
 And it's you we adore, with our lives 
 Singing Alleluia, singing Alleluia

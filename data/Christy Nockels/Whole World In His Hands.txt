When all around is fading 
 And nothing seems to last 
 When each day is filled with sorrow 
 Still I know with all my heart 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I fear no evil for You are with me 
 Strong to deliver, mighty to save 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 And when I walk through the fire 
 I will not be burned 
 When the waves come crashing around me 
 Still I know with all my heart 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I fear no evil for You are with me 
 Strong to deliver, mighty to save 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I believe, I believe 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 Don't you know? 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 And I fear no evil for You are with me 
 Strong to deliver, mighty to save 
 Mighty to save 
 He's got the whole world in His hands

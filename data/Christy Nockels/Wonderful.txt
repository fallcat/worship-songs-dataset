Jesus, You are so wonderful 
 So wonderful in all Your ways 
 The highest praise is Yours alone 
 You are so wonderful 
 So wonderful You are 
 Jesus, You are so beautiful 
 So beautiful that You outshine 
 The brightest light 
 There's no one like You 
 You are so beautiful 
 So beautiful You are 
 And my life will burn for You 
 'Cause Your light shined 
 In the darkness, I was hopeless 
 And You lifted up my head 
 To sing for joy with a song 
 That broke the silence of my worship 
 Now I'm singing all the day 
 And forevermore You will be adored 
 'Cause You are wonderful 
 Jesus, You are magnificent 
 Magnificent, I'm confident 
 Your evidence is everywhere 
 'Cause You are magnificent 
 Magnificent, You are

Freedom is the song I sing 
 I can't contain the joy You bring 
 All because of Your good love 
 Now I live 
 I was dead but now I breathe 
 Awaken to Your grace so free 
 In the power of Your cross 
 Now I live 
 Salvation, my freedom 
 You gave Your all for me 
 Forever 
 You made a way for me 
 You came to my rescue 
 You came to my rescue 
 Calling on Your name 
 Calling on Your name 
 Love came down 
 Your love came down 
 Your love came down 
 Your love came down 
 You're the light in the darkest night 
 You lead me through the storm and fire 
 When all around my hope gives way 
 You're my rock 
 You taught me how to sing Your song 
 You've overwhelmed me with Your love 
 You set my feet to dancing now 
 You're my God 
 Salvation, my freedom 
 You gave Your all for me 
 Forever 
 You made a way for me 
 You came to my rescue 
 You came to my rescue 
 Calling on Your name 
 Calling on Your name 
 Love came down 
 Your love came down 
 Your love came down 
 Your love came down 
 Salvation, my freedom 
 You gave Your all for me 
 Forever 
 You made a way for me 
 You came to my rescue 
 You came to my rescue 
 Calling on Your name 
 Calling on Your name 
 Love came down 
 Your love came down 
 Salvation, my freedom 
 You gave Your all for me 
 Forever 
 You made a way for me

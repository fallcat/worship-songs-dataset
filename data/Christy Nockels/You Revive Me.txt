You revive me 
 You revive me lord 
 And all my deserts are rivers of joy 
 You are the treasure I could not afford 
 So I'll spend myself till I'm empty and poor 
 All for you 
 You revive me lord 
 You revive me 
 Lord I have seen your goodness 
 And I know the way you are 
 Give me eyes to see you in the dark 
 And your face shines a glory 
 That I only know in part 
 And there is still a longing 
 A longing in my heart 
 You revive me 
 You revive me lord 
 And all my deserts are rivers of joy 
 You are the treasure I could not afford 
 So I'll spend myself till I'm empty and poor 
 All for you 
 You revive me lord 
 You revive me 
 My soul is thirsty 
 Only You can satisfy 
 You are the well that never will run dry 
 And I'll praise You for the blessing 
 For calling me your friend 
 And in your name I'm lifting 
 I'm lifting up my hands 
 'Cause You revive me 
 You revive me lord 
 And all my deserts are rivers of joy 
 You are the treasure I could not afford 
 So I'll spend myself till I'm empty and poor 
 All for you 
 You revive me lord 
 All for you 
 You revive me lord

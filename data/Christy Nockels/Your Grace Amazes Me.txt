You alone walked that road all for love 
 The road to Calvary 
 Where death would lose its sting 
 Where chains are broken free 
 Greater love has no one than this 
 That You would give Your life 
 The perfect sacrifice, to wash our sin away 
 Your grace amazes me 
 Your grace amazes me 
 Where else could I go? 
 Where else could I run but to Your arms? 
 There's no height, there's no depth You can't reach 
 And nothing in this world could ever come between us 
 Jesus, I am Yours 
 No, nothing in this world could ever come between us 
 Jesus, I am Yours 
 Your grace amazes me 
 Jesus, Your grace amazes me 
 Where else could I go? 
 Where else could I run but to Your arms? 
 Oh Jesus, Your grace, it changes me 
 Oh Lord, Your grace, my everything 
 What else could I say? 
 What else could I do? 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe 
 Oh, I stand in awe 
 And where else could I go? 
 Where else could I run but to your arms? 
 And what else could I say? 
 What else could I do? 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe 
 Oh Jesus, Your grace amazes me 
 Jesus, Your grace amazes me 
 Where else could I go? 
 Where else could I run but to Your arms? 
 I run to you 
 Jesus, Your grace, it changes me 
 My Jesus, Your grace, my everything 
 And what else could I say? 
 What else could I do? 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe 
 Oh, I stand, I stand...

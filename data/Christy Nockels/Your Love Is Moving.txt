The hem of your robe is where our healing lies 
 The wounds in your hands are where our life resides 
 Your love is moving, moving among us 
 We're desperate to see the beauty of your face 
 We're longing to know the wonders of your grace 
 Your love is moving, moving among us 
 So we reach, we reach our hands to you 
 Our god, you are here and your mercies are new 
 We fall, we fall in worship to you 
 Our god, you are here and in your power you move 
 The faith in our hearts is how we welcome you 
 The joy in our lives is your love breaking through 
 Your love is moving, moving among us

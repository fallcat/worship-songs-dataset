It's the guts and it's the glory, a hundred stripes 
 A hundred stories 
 It's the Pledge of Allegiance on the 4th of July 
 It's the handwritten letters from home 
 It's the sleepless nights alone 
 It's his newborn baby he left with his wife 
 Mr. Red White and Blue 
 Lay down his life 
 Mr. Red White and Blue 
 For these Stars and Stripes 
 From the fields of Indiana 
 To the swamps of Louisiana 
 To the golden coast of Californ' 
 Uncle Sam's the only family he's got 
 His purple heartbeat won't stop 
 And his 18th birthday was the day he was born 
 Mr. Red White and Blue 
 Lay down his life 
 Mr. Red White and Blue 
 For these Stars and Stripes 
 He was the man of the house when he was born 
 His family is proud but torn, but if you 
 Knew him you would understand 
 He was raised on how to be brave 
 Just to see the flag still wave 
 Then he came home with only one hand 
 Mr. Red White and Blue 
 Lay down his life 
 Mr. Red White and Blue 
 For these Stars and Stripes

I sought the Lord, and he heard me 
 I sought the Lord and he heard me cry 
 I sought the Lord, and he heard me 
 I sought the Lord and he heard me cry 
 And he answered me 
 Though weeping endures for the night 
 Your joy comes in the morning 
 Though sorrow may last for a time 
 Your joy comes in the morning 
 Faithful, you're always faithful 
 True, you're always true 
 You'll never leave me, you're always with me 
 You're good, you're good 
 You bring joy, you bring joy 
 You bring joy, you bring joy 
 You bring joy, you bring joy to my soul 
 (Soul soul, soul soul)

Take me by the hand and 
 Walk with me by quiet streams 
 I need to hear the wind and 
 Feel the ground beneath my feet 
 'Cause You're the only friend 
 Who can set my soul at ease 
 And in the quiet pride of my Father's eyes 
 I remember who I am 
 And when I feel the warmth of my Father's smile 
 Feels like I've been born again 
 I've been born again 
 I've been born again 
 And realign my heart and 
 Help me keep the first things first 
 Let me hear Your whisper 
 And God, I hang on every word 
 'Cause You're the only friend 
 Who can set my soul at ease 
 And in the quiet pride of my Father's eyes 
 I remember who I am 
 And when I feel the warmth of my Father's smile 
 Feels like I've been born again 
 I've been born again 
 I've been born again, oh, oh, oh 
 I've been born again

I've counted the cost 
 I count it all as loss 
 For the sake of knowing You 
 I peel my hands away from earthly things 
 God, I turn my eyes away from all these worthless things 
 I lay down honor and fame, I'm sick of building my own name 
 Lord, let everything I do be for Your glory and Your fame 
 Don't wanna' be building castles outta sand cause' I know they won't stand 
 In the wake of the judgment set to come from Your hand 
 When all wood hay and stubble will be burned away 
 Cause' all flesh is fading fast, only Your word remains 
 I've counted the cost 
 I count it all as loss 
 For the sake of knowing You 
 So until the day 
 When I'll see You face to face 
 I'll be taking up my cross 
 I say goodbye to my father, my mother 
 I cling to You and You alone I'll have no other 
 God, this one thing I do, I leave it all behind 
 Cause' You said if I searched then it's You that I would find 
 I fight the fight of faith, I run the race 
 Just give me grace that I could seek Your face 
 So until the day that I die, I'll be living my life 
 So in the end when You return I'll obtain the prize 
 I've counted the cost 
 I count it all as loss 
 For the sake of knowing You 
 So until the day 
 When I'll see You face to face 
 I'll be taking up my cross 
 I lay it all down 
 That I'd be found 
 A pleasing sacrifice 
 I'm living for another day 
 Living for another age 
 Your kingdom come on earth 
 One day He's gonna' split the sky 
 One day He's gonna' come for His bride 
 I know it, I know it, I know it, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

For God so loved the world, He gave His Son 
 To bear the weight of sin, He bled for us 
 From Heaven's highest place, He took a fall 
 And there was just one life, laid down for all 
 Death, where is your sting? 
 Grave, where is your victory? 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He is risen! 
 Behold the vacant tomb that held our Lord 
 That grave became the stage for Heaven's glory 
 And behold the Risen King in open skies 
 He is the Resurrection, He is the life 
 Death, where is your sting? 
 Grave, where is your victory? 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He is risen! 
 No weapon formed against us will prosper 
 The gates of hell won't stand 
 Your Church will rise from glory to glory 
 In the name of Jesus 
 No weapon formed against us will prosper 
 The gates of hell won't stand 
 And Your Church will rise from glory to glory 
 In the name of Jesus 
 Death, where is your sting? 
 Grave, where is your victory? 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He is risen! 
 Death, where is your sting? 
 Grave, where is your victory? 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He is risen!

In the morning when I rise to meet You 
 In the morning when I lift my eyes 
 You're the only One I wanna cling to 
 You're the first thought on my mind 
 Let our voices rise 
 All creation cries 
 Singing out an endless alleluia 
 From this moment on 
 Join with Heaven's song 
 Singing out an endless alleluia! 
 In the moments where You go unnoticed 
 In the ordinary day to day 
 Countless miracles of life around us 
 Point like arrows to Your name 
 Let our voices rise 
 All creation cries 
 Singing out an endless alleluia 
 From this moment on 
 Join with Heaven's song 
 Singing out an endless alleluia! 
 Only a moment to live this life 
 Like shooting stars burning up the night 
 Till Heaven's opened and we arrive 
 In Your presence, Lord 
 In Your presence, Lord... 
 Let our voices rise 
 All creation cries 
 Singing out an endless alleluia 
 From this moment on 
 Join with Heaven's song 
 Singing out an endless alleluia! 
 There's nothing better 
 There's nothing better 
 There's nothing better 
 Than this right now... now-ow-ow 
 There's nothing better 
 There's nothing better 
 There's nothing better 
 Than this right now... now-ow-ow 
 In the evening when I lay my head down 
 In the evening when I close my eyes 
 You're still the only One I wanna cling to 
 You're the last thought on my mind

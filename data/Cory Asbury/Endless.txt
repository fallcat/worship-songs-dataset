Before the start, beyond the end 
 As far as east is from the west 
 Measureless 
 From open sky to ocean depths 
 More than man can comprehend 
 Measureless 
 Your love is without limit, Your love is constant 
 Your love goes on forever, Your love is endless 
 Your love is overwhelming, I can't contain it 
 Your love, Your love 
 Your love is endless! 
 Oh how vast, and oh how wide 
 Far beyond all space and time 
 Measureless 
 Your love is without limit, Your love is constant 
 Your love goes on forever, Your love is endless 
 Your love is overwhelming, I can't contain it 
 Your love, Your love 
 Your love is endless! 
 No death, no height 
 No fear, no shame, no lie 
 I am convinced, even the grave 
 Could never separate 
 No death, no height 
 No fear, no shame, no lie 
 And I am convinced, even the grave 
 Could never separate! 
 Your love is without limit, Your love is constant 
 Your love goes on forever, Your love is endless 
 Your love is overwhelming, I can't contain it 
 Your love, Your love 
 Your love is endless! 
 Your love is without limit, Your love is constant 
 Your love goes on forever, Your love is endless 
 Your love is overwhelming, I can't contain it 
 Your love, Your love 
 Your love is endless!

I was born inside of a rainbow 
 And I was raised on mercy and grace 
 And I was crowned with sweet love and kindness 
 I was made to see Your face 
 So I sing, Hallelujah 
 I sing, Hallelu 
 I sing Hallelujah 
 'Cause I love You 
 'Cause everything You do 
 It just screams I love you 
 Everything You are 
 Says I care (x2) 
 I was called from out of darkness 
 And I was clothed with mercy so sure 
 And I was given beauty for ashes 
 And everything else that I don't deserve 
 What am I that You would love me like You do 
 Who am I that You should care? 
 What is man, what is man, what is man, what is man

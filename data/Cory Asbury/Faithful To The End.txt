The promise of your coming light 
 It burs so brightly in my mind 
 And all creation longs and waits 
 For the dawning of that day 
 And he will come riding on the clouds 
 With justice in his heart 
 And a sword upon his side 
 And all will see the glory of this man 
 With fire in his eyes 
 He's jealous for his bride 
 He's faithful to the end 
 He's faithful to my heart 
 He's faithful to the end 
 He will come and marry me 
 Glory to the righteous one 
 Glory to the righteous one 
 He's faithful to the end 
 He's faithful to my heart 
 He's faithful to the end 
 He will come and marry me

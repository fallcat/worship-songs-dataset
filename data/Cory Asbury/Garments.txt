And I saw my ashes, but You saw Your dream 
 And I saw an orphan, You were my family 
 And I saw my frailty, but You saw Your might 
 And I saw my blindness, but You were the light 
 You give me garments of praise, fullness of joy 
 Unending mercy, new every morning 
 Garments of praise, fullness of joy 
 Unending mercy, new every morning 
 And I saw the water, but You saw the wine 
 And I saw dead branches, but You were the vine 
 And I saw my weakness, but You saw Your blood 
 And I saw my failure, but You were enough 
 You give me garments of praise, fullness of joy 
 Unending mercy, new every morning 
 Garments of praise, fullness of joy 
 Unending mercy, new every morning 
 'Cause I was lost, 'til You called me out by name 
 And I was down, 'til You picked me up again 
 And I was wrong, 'til Your love it made me right 
 I was dead, 'til You sang me back to life 
 And I was lost, 'til You called me out by name 
 I was down, 'til You picked me up again 
 I was wrong, 'til Your love it made me right 
 I was dead, 'til You sang me back to life 
 You give me garments of praise, fullness of joy 
 Unending mercy, new every morning 
 Garments of praise, fullness of joy 
 Unending mercy, new every morning

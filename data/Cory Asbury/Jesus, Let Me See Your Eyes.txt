Father, I desire 
 To see the beauty of Your son 
 Jesus, I wanna' be closer 
 With You where You are 
 With You where You are 
 Jesus let me see Your eyes 
 Let me feel Your embrace 
 Let me feel You all around me 
 Yeah 
 Like Moses, I'm crying, "Show me Your glory" 
 Let me see what he longed to see 
 Just like Mary, Lord I'm choosing the good part 
 To sit here at Your feet 
 To sit here at Your feet 
 Jesus let me see Your eyes 
 Let me feel Your embrace 
 Let me feel You all around me 
 Yeah 
 I was made for, I was made for 
 I was made for, I was made for 
 I was made for, I was made for love

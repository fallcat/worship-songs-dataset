Simple men are simply drawn to simplicity 
 My simple mind has come to find that I'm drawn to infinity 
 Breaking the barriers and barricades, only to seek your face 
 My eyes have caught a glimpse and I just can't turn away 
 I'm drawn to the flame, drawn to the fire 
 Drawn to the One who eyes burn with desire 
 I lay it all down for the sake of the cross 
 I've burned all my bridges, God I've counted the cost 
 So shine your light until I'm blind to this world and it's lies 
 So the windows of my soul are purified just like your bride 
 Spotless and white, no blemish in sight 
 Offering my life as a holy sacrifice 
 I need you, Christ, to ascend that holy hill 
 So give me clean hands, a pure heart, the knowledge of Your will 
 As the war rolls on and the battle rages here I take my stand 
 Cause' I know one day I'll stand before you in the holy land 
 Let me see Your face God 
 I'm crying out for You 
 Open up my eyes to see Your beauty God 
 I want to see you in your splendor, behold you in your glory 
 Gaze upon the beauty that burns bright before me 
 There's not a God whose eyes flicker with flames of jealousy 
 Whose desire is towards me, never ignores me 
 I've been awaken to love, and I can't move my gaze 
 Though the floods roll my way and the waters they rage 
 Your love cannot be quenched, hindered or encaged 
 You're the lion and the lamb, fully God, fully man 
 My eyes have been enlighten, with these words that I've been told 
 You become what you behold, Holy Spirit take control 
 When my flesh is weak, your face I'll seek until my heart is yours 
 Show me the hope of Your calling, who I am in You my Lord 
 Cover the earth with your glory like the waters to the seas 
 You've ravished my heart it's only you my eyes see 
 It's only in you that I'm free, come and liberate me 
 One thing have I desired and it's you alone I seek 
 Let me see Your face God 
 I'm crying out for You 
 Open up my eyes to see Your beauty God 
 Blessed are the pure in heart, they fight the good fight 
 Who leave it all behind to lay a hold of the prize 
 Eagerly awaiting the return of the Christ 
 It's what we're longing for we're waiting for 
 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come" 
 Let me see Your face God 
 I'm crying out for You 
 Open up my eyes to see Your beauty God

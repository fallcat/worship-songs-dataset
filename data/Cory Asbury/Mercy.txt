(Jesus) 
 Mercy covers your throne 
 Like a rainbow, like a rainbow 
 Here I find myself in the sweetest embrace 
 With a love I could never earn 
 And it's only in this place, that I am truly saved 
 Surrendered to beauty untold 
 Your mercy, it covers me wherever I go 
 Your kindness, it never ends, oh Lord 
 There's nothing I could do to change your mind about me 
 There's nothing I could do 
 Mercy flows from your throne 
 Like a river, like a river 
 Here I find myself in the healing embrace 
 With a love I have never known 
 And it's only in this place, that I am truly saved 
 Surrendered to beauty untold 
 There's nothing I could do to change your mind 
 God, there's nothing I could do to change your mind about me 
 There's nothing I can do 
 To keep you from loving me 
 To keep you from wanting me, Jesus 
 Your love it never fails 
 Your love it never fails 
 Your love it never fails me 
 Jesus 
 You're a good, good Father 
 And you love your children 
 Slow to anger, abounding in love 
 You are so, so gracious 
 Oh so merciful 
 How he loves, how you love us so

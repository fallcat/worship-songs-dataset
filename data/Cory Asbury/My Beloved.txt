One thing have I desired of the Lord and that one thing I seek 
 To know You, To know You 
 I was 
 I was made to gaze all of my days 
 I was made to gaze on beauty 
 My beloved is beautiful 
 He's dazzling and excellent 
 My beloved is beautiful 
 One thing have I desired of the Lord and that one thing I seek 
 To know You, To know You 
 I was 
 I was made to gaze all of my days 
 I was made to gaze on beauty 
 My beloved is beautiful 
 He's dazzling and excellent 
 My beloved is beautiful 
 He stands alone 
 He stands alone 
 He stands alone 
 He is coming to rule, coming to reign 
 He's the King, He's the King 
 He is coming to rule, coming to reign 
 Jesus, Jesus

Your love shines in darkest places, reaching for my heart 
 In Your light I find the pieces, every missing part 
 And hope is found in hopeless places, everywhere You are 
 Take my hand and lead me forward, forward to the start 
 'Cause I need You, I need You 
 It only takes a moment 
 For You to fix what's broken in me 
 I need You 
 If You can give the blind man vision, then open up my eyes 
 Lead me out beyond my questions, where faith will be my sight 
 If You can heal the weak and wounded, You can heal my heart 
 Take my hand and lead me forward, forward to the start 
 I need You, I need You 
 It only takes a moment 
 For You to fix what's broken in me 
 I need You 
 You've been there from the beginning, You have walked this road 
 Call my name and I'll keep running, 'til I'm finally home 
 I need You, I need You 
 I need You, I need You 
 It only takes a moment 
 For You to fix what's broken 
 It only takes a moment 
 For You to fix what's broken in me 
 And I need You

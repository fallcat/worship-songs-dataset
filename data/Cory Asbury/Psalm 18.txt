I will love you, Oh Lord the strength of my life 
 You're my Rock and my Fortress, My Deliverer 
 When I call on Your name You answer me 
 So shall I be saved from my enemies 
 You called me out from the darkness and shined Your light 
 You raised me up from death and gave me life 
 Now I love You, Yeah I love You forever 
 I will worship You, Lord with all of my heart 
 You are worthy of all that I am 
 When I call on Your name You answer me 
 So shall I be saved from my enemies 
 You called me out from the darkness and shined Your light 
 You raised me up from death and gave me life 
 Now I love You, Yeah I love You forever 
 In the end all I have is You 
 You are my great reward 
 Through it all I will not lose heart 
 'Cause You're the glory and the lifter of my head 
 You deliver me for You delight in me 
 I am Your beloved One 
 Now I give my life, I surrender 
 Come and take me, I am Yours 
 You called me out from the darkness and shined Your light 
 You raised me up from death and gave me life 
 Now I love You, Yeah I love You forever

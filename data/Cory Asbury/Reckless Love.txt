Before I spoke a word 
 You were singing over me 
 You have been so, so good to me 
 Before I took a breath 
 You breathed Your life in me 
 You have been so, so kind to me 
 Oh, the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God 
 Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine 
 I couldn't earn it 
 I don't deserve it 
 Still You give yourself away 
 Oh, the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God 
 When I was your foe 
 Still Your love fought for me 
 You have been so, so good to me 
 When I felt no worth 
 You paid it all for me 
 You have been so, so kind to me 
 Oh, the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God 
 Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine 
 I couldn't earn it 
 I don't deserve it 
 Still You give yourself away 
 Oh, the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God 
 There's no shadow You won't light up 
 Mountain You won't climb up 
 Coming after me 
 There's no wall You won't kick down 
 No lie You won't tear down 
 Coming after me

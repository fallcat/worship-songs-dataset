One part water and one part dust 
 Yet You're still making trophies out of us 
 Making something out of nothing, it's what You do 
 Yet Your work is never finished and it's never past due 
 Gently Your voice like a calming embrace 
 Calls me from out of the noise 
 You whisper to me, "Child, forget not your dreams" 
 As we lie awake in the dark 
 Just don't lose heart 
 From the dirt to a throne, with a brand new name 
 In the blood of the King running through our veins 
 There's hidden gold in these jars of clay 
 And all these hidden crowns will be revealed one day 
 Yeah, we'll lay them down at Your feet one day 
 Gently Your voice like a calming embrace 
 Calls me from out of the noise 
 You whisper to me, "Child, forget not your dreams" 
 As we lie awake in the, we lie awake in the 
 We lie awake in the dark... 
 Just don't lose heart 
 He's got your hand 
 Don't lose heart, child 
 He knows your name 
 And when everything is falling apart 
 Don't lose heart 
 When everything is falling apart 
 Just don't lose heart

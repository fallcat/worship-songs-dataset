Your presence is all I'm longing for here in the secret place 
 Your nearness is all I'm waiting for here in the quiet place 
 Here in the secret place 
 My soul waits for you alone 
 Like the watchmen wait for dawn 
 Here I've finally found the place 
 Where we'll meet, Lord, face to face 
 I've finally found where I belong 
 I've finally found where I belong, in your presence 
 I've finally found where I belong, Lord 
 To be with you, to be with you 
 Your presence is all I'm longing for here in the secret place 
 Your nearness is all I'm waiting for here in the quiet place 
 Here in the secret place 
 My soul waits for you alone 
 Like the watchmen wait for dawn 
 Here I've finally found the place 
 Where we'll meet, Lord, face to face 
 I've finally found where I belong 
 I've finally found where I belong, in your presence 
 I've finally found where I belong, Lord 
 To be with you, to be with you 
 I am my Beloved's and He is mine 
 So come into your garden and take delight in me 
 Take delight in me 
 Delight in me, delight in me 
 Delight in me, delight in me 
 Here in Your presence, God, I find my rest 
 Here in Your presence, God

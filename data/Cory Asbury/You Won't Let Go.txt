All of my life before You 
 You see when I rise and when I fall 
 You're faithful beyond my weakness 
 Your love will never change, no 
 Your love will never change 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand 
 So I will believe You're for me 
 Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me 
 In life and in death, You have overcome 
 Your love will never fail 
 Your love will never fail! 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand 
 And even in the battle, You are with me 
 And I will not be broken in the fight 
 And You'll go before me and behind me 
 You'll never let me go, You'll never let me go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go, You won't let go 
 You won't let go of my hand

Strong enough to calm the storms 
 Of fear and unbelief 
 Fierce enough to break the cords 
 Of death that clung to me 
 'Cause I have come to know a love 
 Whose power has overcome 
 Every insecurity 
 And Heaven moves and demons flee now 
 As I lift my voice to sing 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 Close enough to hold me near 
 When fear is crippling 
 Safe enough to be my home 
 When my world is crumbling 
 'Cause I have come to know a love 
 Stronger than the grave 
 That in my darkest hour 
 You raised me up from death to life now 
 In resurrection power 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong! 
 And Your love, it vanquished all my enemies 
 It broke the cage that silenced me 
 And set this songbird free 
 I sing, for all the love You've given me 
 Rejoice because You've chosen me 
 And called this orphan home 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong 
 Oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong 
 And oh, Your love is strong

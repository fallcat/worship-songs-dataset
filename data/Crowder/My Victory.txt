You came for criminals and every Pharisee 
 You came for hypocrites, even one like me 
 You carried sin and shame the guilt of every man 
 The weight of all I've done nailed into Your hands 
 Oh, Your love bled for me 
 Oh, Your blood in crimson streams 
 Oh, Your death is hell's defeat 
 A cross meant to kill is my victory 
 Oh, Your amazing grace 
 I've seen and tasted it 
 It's running through my veins 
 I can't escape its grip 
 In You my soul is safe 
 You uncover everything 
 Oh, Your love bled for me 
 Oh, Your blood in crimson streams 
 Oh, Your death is hell's defeat 
 A cross meant to kill is my victory 
 Behold the Lamb of God 
 Who takes away our sin 
 Who takes away our sin 
 The holy Lamb of God 
 Makes us alive again 
 Makes us alive again 
 Behold the Lamb of God 
 Who takes away our sin 
 Who takes away our sin 
 The holy Lamb of God 
 Makes us alive again 
 Makes us alive again 
 Oh, Your love bled for me 
 Oh, Your blood in crimson streams 
 Oh, Your death is hell's defeat 
 A cross meant to kill is my victory 
 Oh, a cross meant to kill is my victory

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost, but now am found. 
 Was blind, but now I see. 
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fears relieved. 
 How precious did that grace appeared 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares, 
 I have already come. 
 It's grace that brought me safe thus far, 
 And grace will lead me home. 
 When we've been there ten thousand years 
 Bright shining as shining as the sun, 
 We've no no no no no no less days to sing my God's praise 
 Then when we first begun 
 Then when we first begun

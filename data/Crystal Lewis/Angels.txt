Is it real, is it not 
 Does it fly, does it walk 
 I know I'd like to talk to one 
 Do I hear the brush of wings 
 Or just the flutter my heart sings 
 Oh the comfort that it brings to me 
 I have friends in high places 
 Assurance of home, there's a hedge all around me 
 Every step is foreknown 
 By the one who is watching 
 He loves His own 
 Friends in high places 
 Surrounding the throne 
 In the garden on the cross 
 A battle waged for the lost 
 In His blood I am washed forever 
 He has won, I'm purified 
 I'm protected through the night 
 He's coming back for me, His bride 
 I'm ready 
 Protection 
 Comfort 
 Lead me to Him

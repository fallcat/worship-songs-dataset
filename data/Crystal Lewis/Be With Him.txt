But Jesus comes to me 
 While I watch and wait 
 And long for peace 
 He is always there 
 It's where I belong for the road I'm on is long 
 Be with Him 
 I'll be with Him until the day I die 
 Be with Him 
 I'll be with Him until the day I die 
 And Jesus comes to me 
 He's my everything 
 He's all I need 
 And His voice I hear 
 He's opened up my eyes 
 It's clear the reason why 
 Be with Him 
 I'll be with Him until the day I die 
 Be with Him 
 I'll be with Him until the day I die 
 And on the day I die Jesus comes to lead me on 
 Taking me home with Him 
 Where I'll be with Him, be with Him, be with Him 
 Forever 
 I'll always be with Him 
 Be with Him always 
 Forever 
 Be with Him 
 I'll be with Him until the day I die 
 Be with Him 
 I'll be with Him until the day I die

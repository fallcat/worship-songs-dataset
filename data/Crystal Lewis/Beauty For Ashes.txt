He gives beauty for ashes 
 Strength for fear 
 Gladness for mourning 
 Peace for despair 
 He gives beauty for ashes 
 Strength for fear 
 Gladness for mourning 
 Peace for despair 
 When sorrow seems to surround you 
 When suffering hangs heavy o'er your head 
 Know that tomorrow brings 
 Wholeness and healing 
 God knows your need 
 Just believe what He said 
 He gives beauty for ashes 
 Strength for fear 
 Gladness for mourning 
 Peace for despair 
 When what you've done keeps you from moving on 
 When fear wants to make itself at home in your heart 
 Know that forgiveness brings 
 Wholeness and healing 
 God knows your need 
 Just believe what He said 
 He gives beauty for ashes 
 Strength for fear 
 Gladness for mourning 
 Peace for despair 
 I once was lost but God has found me 
 Though I was bound I've been set free 
 I've been made righteous in His sight 
 A display of His splendor all can see

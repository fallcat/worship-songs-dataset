Been takin' chances with my life but that don't move me no more 
 Been takin' chances with my life but that don't move me no more 
 I got to tell you devil you ain't welcome round here no more 
 I got my heart in a sling, won't you mend it up with your love 
 I got my heart in a sling won't you mend it on up with your love 
 I got to get on my knees ask help from the Lord above 
 Been takin' chances baby 
 Been takin' chances baby 
 Been takin' chances baby 
 Way too many chances baby 
 Been takin' chances Lordy but that don't move me no more 
 Once I was blind but now I see again 
 Once I was blind but now I see again 
 I got to shout it from the mountain I've fallen in love again 
 Those funny little footsteps I don't do that dance no more 
 Those funny little footsteps I don't do that dance no more 
 I been jivin' so long I forgot what your love was for 
 Throw my cards down on the table 
 Put my dice back in the can 
 Can't take it off the shelf then put it back again 
 Been takin' chances Lordy but that don't move me no more 
 Been takin' chances Lordy but that don't move me no more 
 Been takin' chances with my life but that don't move me no more 
 Been takin' chances with my life but that don't move me no more 
 I got to tell you devil you ain't welcome round here no more 
 Those funny little footsteps I don't do that dance no more 
 Those funny little footsteps I don't do that dance no more 
 I been jivin' so long I forgot what your love was for

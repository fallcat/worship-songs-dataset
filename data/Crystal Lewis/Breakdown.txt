I gotta message for you 
 Think you'll understand 
 Yeah, don't wanna force it down you 
 Just wanna share the plan 
 Now baby c'mon 
 I'm not so crazy now 
 Neither are you 
 Not with all I've been through 
 If you see the light ahead of you 
 And you don't like what you're going through 
 If you don't wanna wear the Devil's crown 
 Breakdown! 
 You've got something to tell me 
 You'd better spit it out, Yeah 
 But if you try to sell me 
 I think you better stand back 
 Baby, C'mon, I wasn't born yesterday 
 Oh no no, and neither were you 
 Not with all you've been through 
 If you see the light ahead of you 
 And you don't like what you're going through 
 If you don't wanna to wear the Devil's crown 
 Breakdown

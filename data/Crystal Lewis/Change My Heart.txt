Oh God protect me from myself 
 My fearful, weary soul 
 It wants to hold on 
 When all I want is to let go 
 Oh God protect me from myself 
 My hand and wandering heart 
 It speeds toward the wrong 
 When all I want to do is start 
 Not to do that anymore 
 I don't want to do that anymore 
 Change my heart oh God 
 From the sinful state it's in 
 To the state you want it in 
 I want to please you 
 Change my heart oh God 
 How do I escape from sin 
 My old self loves to do it 
 What a terrible predicament 
 I find myself in 
 I find myself in sin 
 I want out of this sin I'm in 
 To please Him is to know Him 
 To know Him is to see 
 That obedience to law is not 
 What keeps us whole and free 
 Is not a thing indeed 
 It is the body of a saviour, 
 Jesus Christ the king 
 I am realizing that the answer lies insight 
 If in fact I have accepted Jesus in my life 
 It all comes down, the choice is now 
 The issue of control 
 Have I chosen God 
 Or would I rather be the one 
 Controlling the destiny of the mind... CHANGE! 
 Do I do what I do or don't do what I want to do? 
 Do I do what I do or don't do what I want to do?

I'm lookin' for a way out 
 Which way did I come in 
 Why do you find me taking your love for granted again 
 I didn't want to hurt you 
 Guess I always wanted to know 
 But now I'm certain that I would be a fool 
 To ever let you go 
 'Cause I believe in you 
 Won't you believe in me 
 Whenever I walk on dangerous ground 
 Whenever I lose my way 
 Whenever I call you're there to lift me up 
 Bringing me back in your arms 
 Once more 
 I'm making no excuses 
 I don't have the power I should 
 But being without you a moment longer 
 Would do no good 
 So tell me where I'm going wrong 
 I'm willing to make a start 
 Don't want to be the one who could ever break your heart 
 'Cause I believe in you 
 Won't you believe in me 
 Whenever I walk on dangerous ground 
 Whenever I lose my way 
 Whenever I call you're there to lift me up 
 Bringing me back in your arms 
 Once more

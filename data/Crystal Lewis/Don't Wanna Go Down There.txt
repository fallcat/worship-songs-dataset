If I die young, don't wanna go down there 
 If I die young, don't wanna go down there 
 If I die young, don't wanna go down there 
 Don't wanna go, no I don't wanna go, said I don't wanna go down there 
 Ain't no water down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 Ain't no water down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 Ain't no water down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 Don't wanna go, no I don't wanna go, said I don't wanna go down there 
 Well I went down near the deceiver 
 And I'll tell you the reason why 
 I told my Lord before me 
 That I wouldn't be ready to die 
 Ain't no joy down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 Ain't no joy down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 Ain't no joy down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 Don't wanna go, no I don't wanna go, said I don't wanna go down there 
 There's a hell down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 There's a hell down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 There's a hell down yonder, don't wanna go there 
 Don't wanna go, no I don't wanna go, said I don't wanna go down there

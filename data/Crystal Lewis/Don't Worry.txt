Has tomorrow got you wondering 
 Worrying what tomorrow's gonna bring 
 Afraid of what might be there 
 Afraid of what might not be 
 Your mind is filled with these things 
 The object of your worry 
 Keeps your mind off what it should be on 
 Don't think about your problems 
 He will give you peace 
 Be patient for His promise 
 Every one He's gonna keep 
 Put your eyes on heaven 
 Take pride in knowing He knows 
 Put your eyes on heaven 
 Where is your attention 
 Rest in the Lord, wait for Him to act 
 He'll supply our every need 
 He'll give enough when we're in lack 
 Give in to His mercy, let Him have His rightful place 
 It's better to have little than much in His place 
 Birds in the blue sky, flowers of the earth 
 They need nothing God can't give 
 He takes care of tomorrow

Walkin' down Dyer Road 
 Thinking bout life and lovin' living 
 Happy to know what I know 
 Glad to lead the life that I've been given 
 Not to say I never get down 
 I have had my share of sheer frustration 
 Through it all I finally found 
 I've got a God that knows my situation 
 I know it'll be all right 
 I know it'll be all right 
 Walkin' down Dyer Road 
 I'm delighted to know God is watching 
 Giving me just enough 
 Information to keep me in trusting 
 Sending me a sign now and then 
 Just to make sure that I'm still listening 
 Every single promise has been true to everyone 
 You better trust Him... 
 It's all right 
 Although sometimes I wonder 
 All right, all right, if I believe at all 
 I do, I've discovered...

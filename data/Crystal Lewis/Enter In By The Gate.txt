Enter in by the gate 
 Enter in by the narrow gate 
 For only few will ever find it 
 Enter in by the gate 
 Enter in by the narrow gate 
 For few are those who will ever find it 
 Enter in by the gate 
 Enter in by the narrow gate 
 For only few will ever find it 
 Enter in by the gate 
 Enter in by the narrow gate 
 For few are those who will ever find it 
 Simplicity, the quickest way 
 Just do the right thing yea 
 Does she believe in what she cannot see 
 She does but only half heartedly 
 I've heard some say that Jesus lives 
 I've heard some say that He's not coming back 
 My friend today I stand convinced for sure 
 I'm gonna head on down the narrow way 
 In our world today 
 Where evil reigns 
 We fight against powers unseen 
 Regardless of your color or creed 
 Jesus came to set your soul at peace 
 Now the father says come follow me 
 Please don't go away grieved 
 The time has come to choose 
 Don't hesitate 
 Won't you come with me on down the narrow way 
 Enter in by the gate 
 Enter in by the narrow gate 
 For only few will ever find it 
 Enter in by the gate 
 Enter in by the narrow gate 
 For few are those who will ever find it

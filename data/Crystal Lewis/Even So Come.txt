You have taken the precious 
 From the worthless and given us 
 Beauty for ashes, love for hate 
 You have chosen the weak things of the world 
 To shame that which is strong, and the foolish things 
 To shame the wise 
 You are help to the helpless 
 Strength to the stranger 
 And a father to the child who's left alone 
 And the thirsty you've invited 
 To come to the water 
 And those who have no money come and buy 
 So come, so come 
 So come, so come 
 Oh, the days are coming 
 For the Lord has promise 
 When the plowman will over take the reaper 
 And their hearts will be the threshing floor 
 And the move of God we've cried out for, will come 
 You will shake the heavens, and fill your house will glory 
 Turn the shame of the outcast into praise 
 All creation groans and waits 
 For the Spirit and the Bride to say 
 The words your heart has longed to hear 
 So come, so come 
 So come, so come

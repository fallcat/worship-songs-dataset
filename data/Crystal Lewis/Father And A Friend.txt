It's a cloudy day and I feel afraid 
 I have to close my eyes 
 I don't want to hurt again 
 I really just need a friend 
 You were there for me 
 You were there to see 
 When I was crying out 
 Just to be close to you 
 Just to be loved by you 
 Daddy don't you know I love you 
 It takes someone to be 
 A father and a friend 
 I love you 
 You were everything to me 
 You were everything 
 Remember the night when you held me tight 
 I told you through my tears 
 I felt unwanted 
 And you said you wanted 
 To be there for me 
 To be there to see 
 My life to blossom forth 
 The beauty you knew was there 
 And you took the time to care 
 Daddy don't you know I love you 
 It takes someone to be 
 A father and a friend 
 I love you 
 You were everything to me 
 You were everything

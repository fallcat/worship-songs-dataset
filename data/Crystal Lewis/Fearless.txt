I was weak 
 I was so fragile 
 By myself not worth that much 
 Not worth that much at all 
 I was scared 
 I was so cold 
 Was afraid to take a step 
 A step lest I should fall 
 Yet amidst my fear of dying 
 I found faith enough for flying 
 And an endless source of freedom 
 For my wings 
 Fearless in the face of danger 
 Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
 Not afraid to tell you what I've found 
 I'm fearless all around 
 Fearless in the face of danger 
 Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
 Not afraid to tell you what I've found 
 I'm fearless all around 
 I am not ashamed 
 I am satisfied 
 For to me to die is gain 
 And to live is Christ 
 I am not afraid 
 I am not alone 
 For my hope is held in this 
 My God is in control 
 Though the wind is cold and biting 
 I can see the sun is shining 
 Though the clouds bring rain for ruin 
 I see clear sky 
 Fearless in the face of danger 
 Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
 Not afraid to tell you what I've found 
 I'm fearless all around 
 Fearless in the face of danger 
 Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
 Not afraid to tell you what I've found 
 I'm fearless all around 
 Yet amidst my fear of dying 
 I found faith enough for flying 
 And an endless source of freedom 
 For my wings 
 So I fan to flame a fire 
 The gift of God now my desire 
 Is to watch the word inspire 
 You to fly 
 Fearless in the face of danger 
 Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
 Not afraid to tell you what I've found 
 I'm fearless all around 
 Fearless in the face of danger 
 Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
 Not afraid to tell you what I've found 
 I'm fearless all around

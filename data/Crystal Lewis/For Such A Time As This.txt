I built my house here long side this mountain 
 This rugged mountain that stands so tall 
 I've had a good life above the lowlands 
 It's more than I asked for but less than I dreamed 
 I've often heard a voice call down to me 
 If you'd climb higher you'd find wonderous things to see 
 But the way is steep and a storm may come 
 For such a time as this 
 Isn't much too great a risk 
 I've never flown from the edge of a cliff 
 Never walked on the water 
 But if I turn away 
 How will I know what I have missed 
 Have I waited all of mylife 
 For such a time as this 
 I've been content to not ask those questions 
 That stir the rivers, that move the waves 
 The windless waters are so much more peaceful 
 They calm my spirit in silent song 
 I've often wondered what's eluding me 
 The yearning meant to free me from complacency 
 But the way is steep and a storm may come 
 For such a time as this 
 Isn't much too great a risk 
 I've never flown from the edge of a cliff 
 Never walked on the water 
 But if I turn away 
 How will I know what I have missed 
 Have I waited all of mylife 
 For such a time as this 
 Sometimes the thrill of soaring had to begin with the fear of falling 
 For such a time as this 
 Isn't much too great a risk 
 I've never flown from the edge of a cliff 
 Never walked on the water 
 But if I turn away 
 How will I know what I have missed 
 Have I waited all of mylife 
 For such a time as this

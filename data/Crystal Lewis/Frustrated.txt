Frustrated, aggravated, each time I fall 
 Frustrated, simply stated, wait on his call 
 The walls are closing in around me 
 I know you feel the same way too 
 He's never left me since he found me 
 The only light that's shining through 
 If I can hang on... a little longer 
 He's making our bond... a little stronger 
 Frustrated, aggravated, each time I fall 
 Frustrated, simply stated, wait on his call 
 Your life is like a roller coaster 
 Climbing to the very top 
 I think there's something you should know sir 
 Your headed for the deepest drop 
 If I can hang on... a little longer 
 He's making our bond... a little stronger 
 Frustrated, aggravated, each time I fall 
 Frustrated, simply stated, wait on his call 
 If we can hang on... a little longer 
 He'll be making our bond... a little stronger

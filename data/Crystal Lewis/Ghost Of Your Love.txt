Lord how I've missed you, how I curse the day 
 I was so unfaithful, then I went my way 
 No need to ask the question, "Am I blue?" 
 My heart is haunted with the memory of you 
 I'm all alone with the Ghost of your love 
 I see you everywhere the Ghost of your love 
 Always at my shoulder, nothing could be colder 
 Than turning my back on the Ghost of your love 
 I don't blame you Lord, I know I should have prayed 
 Didn't mean to shame you, just happened that way 
 Give me one more chance and help me not back down 
 From that old rugged cross where perfect love is found 
 Now you've found me, how I praise this day 
 You've been so faithful, to never walk away 
 I know what it means to say my love is true 
 I've learned my lesson from watching how you do 
 I'm not alone with the Ghost of your love 
 He leads me everywhere, the Ghost of your love 
 Always at my shoulder, nothing could be bolder 
 Then giving my life to the Ghost of your love

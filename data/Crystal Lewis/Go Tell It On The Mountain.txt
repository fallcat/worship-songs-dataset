While shepherds kept their watching 
 Over silent flocks by night, 
 Behold throughout the heavens, 
 There shone a holy light: 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere; 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 The shepherds feared and trembled 
 When lo! above the earth 
 Rang out the angel chorus 
 That hailed our Saviour's birth: 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere; 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 Down in a lowly manger 
 Our humble Christ was born 
 And God send us salvation, 
 That blessed Christmas morn: 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere; 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 When I am a seeker, 
 I seek both night and day; 
 I seek the Lord to help me, 
 And He shows me the way: 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere; 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 He made me a watchman 
 Upon the city wall, 
 And if I am a Christian, 
 I am the least of all. 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere; 
 Go, Tell It On The Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born.

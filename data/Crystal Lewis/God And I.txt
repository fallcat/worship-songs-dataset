I have pride, He is meek 
 I have shame, He is glory 
 I'm deceitful, He is truthful 
 I'm not worthy but He is the giver 
 His death for my life 
 God and I 
 If apart from Him, I know I will surely, surely die 
 I know that I'm not much to give 
 It's only for His love that I have my life to live 
 He has fullness, I am so empty 
 He is love, I need so much love 
 He is always there, I am always found 
 He is the giver, I'm not worthy 
 His death for my life 
 God and I 
 If apart from Him, I know I will surely, surely die 
 I know that I'm not much to give 
 It's only for His love that I have my life to live

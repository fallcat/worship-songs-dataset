God's been good to me 
 Oh God's always been good 
 God's been good to me 
 Oh God's always been good 
 I don't always say the right things 
 Boy I try 
 I don't always live my life the right way 
 But God is faithful to forgive me 
 When I fail or fall 
 I am unworthy of it all 
 Still He keeps on givin' 
 God's been good to me 
 Oh God's always been good 
 God's been good to me 
 Oh God's always been good 
 My God has given me 
 More than I ever dreamed 
 A precious family 
 And friends who care for me 
 Why should he love me so 
 Oh that Ill never know 
 I am unworthy of it all 
 Still He keeps on givin' to me 
 God's been good to me 
 Oh God's always been good 
 God's been good to me 
 Oh God's always been good 
 It would take hours and days at a time 
 For me to sit down and write down 
 All the things Hes done 
 Let me say this that its nothing I've done 
 But it's the grace He gives freely to everyone 
 Tell everybody 
 Tell everybody 'bout it 
 Tell everybody 
 Everybody 'ought to know

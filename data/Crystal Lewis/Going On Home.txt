Well you hear the knock upon your door 
 But you say there's no one home 
 Your cupboard's bare and you know there's 
 No runnin' from the Lord 
 Well it happens almost everyday 
 And I hope you see by now 
 That without a hitch you gotta scratch that itch 
 You better give it up right now 
 Well I know you know about heaven above 
 And I know you know it's true 
 If the Lord comes back before you're ready 
 Whatta ya think you're gonna do 
 Well I've seen it a thousand times before 
 So I know you're not alone 
 I just wanna shout on that Judgement Day 
 Come on we're goin' on home 
 Well you see your life through the rear view mirror 
 And you wonder where your goin' 
 If you look up ahead and hear what He said 
 You'll wonder what it is you're doin' 
 Well there's too many drivers at your wheel 
 You gotta steer a steady course 
 To the one you thank - put some gas in your tank 
 You gotta keep your eye on the Lord

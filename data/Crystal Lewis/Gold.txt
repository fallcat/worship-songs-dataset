Here's to the woman abandoned by her husband 
 Who left her for another woman 
 And to her children 
 For half the love they've been given 
 Has left them all of a sudden 
 Blessed are those who mourn 
 For they shall receive great comfort 
 But still I found death seems to bring forth life 
 All your heartaches 
 All your sufferings 
 All your trials 
 Are gold 
 Here's to the woman whose left to raise her children 
 She doesn't know the first thing about how to make a living 
 And all the birthdays and ball games and christmas mornings 
 Will never be the same 
 Blessed are the poor in spirit for their's is the kingdom of heaven 
 But still I found death seems to bring forth life 
 All your heartaches 
 All your sufferings 
 All your trials 
 Are gold 
 All your sorrows 
 All your pain 
 All your trials... are gold

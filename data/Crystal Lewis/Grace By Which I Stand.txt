Lord, the feelings are not the same 
 I guess I'm older, I guess I've changed 
 And now I wish I had been explained 
 That as you're growing, you must remember 
 That nothing lasts 
 Except the grace of God 
 By which I stand 
 In Jesus 
 I know that I would surely fall away 
 Except for grace 
 By which I stand 
 Lord, I remember that special way 
 I vowed to serve you, when it was brand new 
 But like Peter, I can't even watch and pray 
 One hour and I bet 
 I could deny you too 
 Nothing lasts 
 Except the grace of God 
 By which I stand 
 In Jesus 
 I know that I would surely fall away 
 Except for grace 
 By which I stand

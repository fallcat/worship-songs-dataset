Lord I am tired 
 I'm losing sleep 
 I stuggle with breathing 
 It overwhelms me 
 Lord I am thirsty 
 I don't want to eat 
 My body is aching 
 For peace 
 I'd like to run again 
 Or even just walk 
 Or just see the ocean 
 One more time 
 Lord I look forward 
 To sit at your feet 
 I know what you'll do for me when we meet 
 I can feel your healing oil 
 Running down my brow 
 I wouldn't trade another lifetime 
 For how I feel right now 
 I can feel your healing oil 
 Running down my brow 
 I wouldn't trade another lifetime 
 For how I feel right now 
 Lord I am weary 
 I know that you're near 
 Take care of my family 
 While we're apart 
 And I thank you for giving me 
 This life that I've had 
 Now I look for the comfort 
 Of your arms

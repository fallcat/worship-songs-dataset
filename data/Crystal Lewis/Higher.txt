Hear my cry oh God 
 Listen to my prayer 
 From the end of the earth 
 I cry out to you 
 Lead me to 
 The might rock 
 That is higher than I 
 Lead me to 
 The might rock 
 That is higher than I 
 Let me dwell in your tent 
 I shall live forever 
 Oh to be safe underneath 
 The shelter of your wings 
 Lead me to 
 The might rock 
 That is higher than I 
 Lead me to 
 The might rock 
 That is higher than I 
 I sing in the shadow of your wings 
 My soul thirsts for you 
 In a dry and weary land 
 Where water can't be found 
 Your love is better than life

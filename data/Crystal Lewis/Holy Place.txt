Bring me into the holy place 
 Jesus I want to see your face 
 To feel a tender spirit 
 Of mercy and of grace 
 Bring me into, into the holy place 
 Bring me into, into the holy place 
 Oh Lamb of God free my soul 
 To worship and adore 
 You are the one, the only Son 
 Breathe life into this one 
 Who seeks you now 
 Won't you let me know 
 The brightness of your throne 
 Your Spirit washes with fire 
 To purify this child 
 Bring me into the holy place 
 Jesus I want to see your face 
 To feel a tender spirit 
 Of mercy and of grace 
 Bring me into, into the holy place 
 Bring me into, into the holy place 
 Blood and water flowed from you 
 To fill me up and give me a new 
 Life worth living, a love worth giving 
 A prize worth running for

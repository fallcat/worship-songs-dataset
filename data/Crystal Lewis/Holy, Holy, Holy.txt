Holy, holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee 
 Holy, holy, holy, 
 Merciful and mighty 
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 All the saints adore Thee, 
 Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea; 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee, 
 Who wert, and art, and evermore shall be. 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Tho' the darkness hide Thee, 
 Tho' the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see; 
 Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee, 
 Perfect in power, in love, and purity. 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 All Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in earth, and sky, and sea; 
 Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty! 
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

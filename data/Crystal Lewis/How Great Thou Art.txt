O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder 
 Consider all the works Thy hands have made, 
 I see the stars, I hear the rolling/mighty thunder, 
 Thy pow'r through-out the universe displayed! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art! 
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander 
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, 
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur 
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze, 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art! 
 And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, 
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in 
 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
 He bled and died to take away my sin! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art! 
 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation 
 And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! 
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration 
 And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

There are moments in my life 
 When I feel that all is fine, comparable to paradise 
 Then the wind begins to blow 
 And my skin begins to show 
 Back to being vulnerable 
 Pride tells me to run away 
 Love tells me to say 
 I guess I'll fall in love with you again 
 I guess I fell (I fell for you) 
 I guess we're better when we are together 
 I guess I knew 
 Different views out the same window, 
 Different steps down the same road 
 That's what makes us who we are 
 When I learn to love you deeper, 
 The grass I thought was greener 
 I'll see was in my own backyard 
 Tried to do it my way, 
 Had to learn the hard way 
 I guess I'll fall in love with you again 
 I guess I fell (I fell for you) 
 I guess we're better when we are together 
 I guess I knew 
 I wanna stop wanting, to change the way you do (the things you do) 
 Much to my chagrin', I fell again, no coincidence my falling for you 
 I'm still on your side 
 I guess I'll fall in love with you again 
 I guess I fell (I fell for you) 
 I guess we're better when we are together 
 I guess I knew 
 I guess I'll fall in love with you again 
 I guess I fell (I fell for you) 
 I guess we're better when we are together 
 I guess I knew

I must tell Jesus 
 All of my trials 
 I cannot bear these burdens alone 
 In my distress 
 He kindly will help me 
 He ever cares and loves His own 
 I must tell Jesus 
 All of my troubles 
 He's a kind and compassionate friend 
 If I but ask Him 
 He will deliver 
 Make of my troubles 
 Quickly an end 
 I must tell Jesus 
 I must tell Jesus 
 I cannot bear these burdens alone 
 I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus 
 Jesus can help me, Jesus alone 
 Tempted and tried I need a great savior 
 One who can help my burdens to bear 
 I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus 
 He all my cares and sorrows will share 
 I must tell Jesus 
 I must tell Jesus 
 I cannot bear these burdens alone 
 I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus 
 Jesus can help me, Jesus alone

Many people in the world walk around with a hole in the heart 
 Many people in the world wanna fill that hole with the latest thing that's outta sight 
 Many people in the world will never truly be set free 
 The only reason that we live is Christ came down 
 And died for you and me 
 I now live because Christ died 
 And though he had suffered 
 He suffered it all for me 
 I now live because Christ died 
 And though he had suffered 
 He suffered it all for me 
 Falling in and out of love is what the world is turnin' to 
 Never really satisfied, not really sure 
 Always needin' something more 
 Looking for another way without the work to get the pay 
 The wages of a righteous man bring him life, he can surely say 
 I now live because Christ died 
 And though he had suffered 
 He suffered it all for me 
 I now live because Christ died 
 And though he had suffered 
 He suffered it all for me

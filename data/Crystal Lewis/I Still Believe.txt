When I can't feel 
 Your love for me 
 The pain in my soul 
 It won't let me sleep 
 I imagine you here 
 And it dries up my tears 
 Even though I can't see 
 I still believe 
 I believe in love 
 I believe in peace 
 I believe someday 
 You'll return for me 
 I believe in things 
 That I cannot see 
 And when my heart says no 
 I still believe 
 Just when I think 
 My faith is gone 
 I hear your sweet voice 
 Crying out hold on 
 It is amazing how we 
 Were always meant to be 
 And now I can breathe again 
 I believe in love 
 I believe in peace 
 I believe someday 
 You'll return for me 
 I believe in things 
 That I cannot see 
 And when my heart says no 
 I still believe 
 I believe the sun 
 Will shine again 
 And the loneliness 
 Someday will end 
 I will stand right here 
 Till your voice I hear 
 Forever and always 
 I believe in love 
 I believe in peace 
 I believe someday 
 You'll return for me 
 I believe in things 
 That I cannot see 
 And when my heart says no 
 I still believe

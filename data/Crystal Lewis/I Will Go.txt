...And he said "Come, and follow me 
 I'm calling you I want you to be 
 A fisherman to fish for those 
 Who are drowning in a scowling sea 
 A sea of lonliness and pain 
 Confusion, hurt, worry, shame 
 I'm holding out my hand 
 And yet they don't hear me call their name 
 I want you to be the one 
 To tell them that the Kingdom's come 
 And give them all the truth and joy 
 You've been given by the Son 
 Will you go 
 Wherever I lead 
 Be light in the dark 
 And be salt in the street 
 Will you go 
 No matter the cost 
 Will you live for the lost 
 So they'll know of the cross 
 Will you go 
 I said Oh no, Lord not me 
 I'm not good enough to go you see 
 I mean what if they laugh or worse 
 Start throwing things and I get hurt 
 Besides that, what would I say 
 I think there's been a big mistake 
 Lord, please ask this of someone else 
 I can't go I'm too afraid 
 I want you to be the one 
 To tell them that the Kingdom's come 
 And give them all the truth and joy 
 You've been given by the Son 
 Will you go 
 Wherever I lead 
 Be light in the dark 
 And be salt in the street 
 Will you go 
 No matter the cost 
 Will you live for the lost 
 So they'll know of the cross 
 Will you go 
 He said yes, some will cover their ears 
 And they will not want to hear 
 You must stand and say it still 
 Be brave my child and do not fear 
 For it is my words you'll speak 
 And I promise I will keep 
 You safe and sound within my will 
 I'm your strength when you're weak 
 I want you to be the one 
 To tell then that the Kingdom's come 
 And give them all the truth and joy 
 You've been given by the Son 
 I will go 
 Wherever You lead 
 Be light inthe dark 
 And be salt in the street 
 I will go 
 No matter the cost 
 I will live for the lost 
 So they'll know of the cross 
 I will go 
 Wherever you lead 
 Be light in the dark 
 And be salt in the street 
 I will go 
 No matter the cost 
 I will live for the lost 
 So they'll know of the cross 
 I will go 
 I will go 
 Here I am 
 Send me 
 Oh yeah

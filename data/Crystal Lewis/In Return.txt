All I had to give 
 Was a broken heart, torn apart 
 That's all I had to give 
 All I had to give 
 Was an empty hope and promises 
 But in return He gave me joy 
 That could never be told 
 And in return he gave me love 
 That was more precious than gold 
 So whatever you have to give 
 You don't have to be ashamed 
 Just come as you are 
 And present it in Jesus name 
 For in return of a torn life 
 He'll give you life abundantly 
 And in return of a raging storm 
 The Lord will calm the sea 
 So whatever you have 
 The Lord has so much more 
 So what do you have to give 
 Oh if you were like me 
 You didn't have a lot of gold 
 Position or money 
 You didn't own wealth untold 
 But I'm glad He didn't look on the things that I had 
 But he looked and gave me all, all that I need 
 Oh for in return He gave me joy 
 That could never be told 
 And in return He gave me love 
 That was more precious, more precious than gold 
 In return of a torn life 
 He gave me life abundantly 
 And in return of a raging storm 
 The Lord will calm the sea 
 So what do you have to give

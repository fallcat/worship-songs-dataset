Hey, it's all right... 
 Hey, it's all right... 
 It's all right, it's all right, it's all right 
 See that man walkin' down the street 
 Well he used to be a liar and cheat 
 Till the light shone down from heaven above 
 Showed that man his one true love 
 Now he's all right, he's all right, he's all right 
 See that woman ain't goin' no where 
 Ridin' that car, wind in her hair 
 Stayin' out late and drinkin' all night 
 Gotta say the word baby, just one time 
 Then it's all right, it's all right, it's all right 
 See the child, Lord, with no family 
 Look in his eyes - his mind's out at sea 
 His life was over when it just begun 
 Starts livin' through the barrel of a gun 
 But it's all right, it's all right, it's all right 
 Hey, it's all right... 
 Hey, it's all right... 
 It's all right, it's all right, it's all right

I am lost without you 
 I lose my way when you're not near 
 I am cold when I'm alone 
 I sometimes forget just who I am 
 I am borrowed I am bruised 
 When I'm broken then I'm used 
 I have strength and I have Peace 
 I've traded fire for my fear 
 The hope of heaven's always near 
 It's only human 
 When I fall I feel I can't go on 
 It's only heaven now 
 That carries me and takes me over 
 Your lifted voice has carried 
 Your words have burned and scarred my heart 
 You find in me what no one sees 
 You have shown me life's complete 
 I am human but I've grace 
 As I fall I see your face 
 Then I sing of you and look to you 
 I am blessed for when I fear 
 The hope of heaven's always near 
 It's only human 
 When I fall I feel I can't go on 
 It's only heaven now 
 That carries me and takes me over 
 I have taken your oath 
 And you preserve my life 
 Your words have covered me

I can see the teardrops in your eyes 
 Seems to me that now you realize 
 Jesus belongs in your heart 
 I can hear between your words, your breathless sigh 
 Seems to me that now you realize 
 Jesus belongs in your heart 
 Talkin' 'bout my Saviour 
 Talkin' 'bout my Lord 
 He alone can save you 
 If you'll take Him at His word 
 Singin' 'bout my Jesus 
 And lifting up His name 
 Trust in Him to save you 
 You'll never be the same

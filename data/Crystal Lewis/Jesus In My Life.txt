I get down upon my knees 
 When I think of you 
 And what you've done for me 
 You brought me back 
 And gave to me 
 A precious gift for all to see 
 Jesus in my life 
 For all to see 
 Jesus in my life 
 For all to see 
 I will lay down my life 
 To serve you Lord 
 My whole life 
 I give it back 
 Do what you will 
 Take my voice 
 So all can hear 
 Jesus in my life 
 So all can hear 
 Jesus in my life 
 So all can hear 
 So all can see 
 Why I'm on my knees 
 So all can hear 
 Why I sing to Thee

I hear the Savior say, 
 "Thy strength indeed is small; 
 Child of weakness, watch and pray, 
 Find in Me thine all in all." 
 Jesus paid it all, 
 All to Him I owe; 
 Sin had left a crimson stain, 
 He washed it white as snow. 
 And when before the throne 
 I stand in Him complete, 
 "Jesus died my soul to save," 
 My lips shall still repeat.

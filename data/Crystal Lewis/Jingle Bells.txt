Dashing through the snow 
 On a one-horse open sleigh, 
 Over the fields we go, 
 Laughing all the way; 
 Bells on bob-tail ring, 
 Making spirits bright, 
 What fun it is to ride and sing 
 A sleighing song tonight 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
 Jingle all the way! 
 O what fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh 
 A day or two ago, 
 I thought I'd take a ride, 
 And soon Miss Fanny Bright 
 Was seated by my side; 
 The horse was lean and lank; 
 Misfortune seemed his lot; 
 He got into a drifted bank, 
 And we, we got upsot. 
 Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, 
 Jingle all the way! 
 What fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh. 
 A day or two ago, 
 The story I must tell 
 I went out on the snow 
 And on my back I fell; 
 A gent was riding by 
 In a one-horse open sleigh, 
 He laughed as there 
 I sprawling lie, 
 But quickly drove away. 
 Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, 
 Jingle all the way! 
 What fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh. 
 Now the ground is white 
 Go it while you're young, 
 Take the girls tonight 
 And sing this sleighing song; 
 Just get a bob-tailed bay 
 Two-forty as his speed 
 Hitch him to an open sleigh 
 And crack! you'll take the lead. 
 Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, 
 Jingle all the way! 
 What fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh.

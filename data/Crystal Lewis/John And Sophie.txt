John and Sophie prayed one day 
 Longing for a child 
 You see they were unable to conceive 
 Found it hard to understand 
 God with such a mighty hand 
 Didn't show compassion in their time of need 
 God knew what he was doing 
 He knows what we need (we need Him) 
 Jesus wants us to know that we are His children 
 He chose us, chose to love us 
 We'll be with Him forever 
 John and Sophie prayed one day 
 Seeking out an answer 
 Would Rachel understand that they had chosen her 
 You see it was no accident 
 We really wanted you 
 Tears began to sting her eyes 
 As she realized 
 God knew what he was doing 
 He knows what we need (we need Him) 
 Jesus wants us to know that we are His children 
 He chose us, chose to love us 
 We'll be with Him forever 
 As children of God we are heirs to His throne 
 We sacrifice and suffer so that we may share 
 His Glory 
 God knew what he was doing 
 He knows what we need (we need Him) 
 Jesus wants us to know that we are His children 
 He chose us, chose to love us 
 We'll be with Him forever

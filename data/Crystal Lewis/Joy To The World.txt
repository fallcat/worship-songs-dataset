Joy to the world! The Lord is come. 
 Let earth receive her King 
 Let every heart 
 Prepare Him room 
 And Saints and angels sing 
 And Saints and angels sing 
 And Saints and Saints and angels sing 
 Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns 
 Let Saints their songs employ 
 While fields and floods 
 Rocks, hills and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat, Repeat, the sounding joy 
 Joy to the world with truth and grace 
 And makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders and wonders of His love 
 No more will sin and sorrow grow, 
 Nor thorns infest the ground; 
 He'll come and make the blessings flow 
 Far as the curse was found, 
 Far as the curse was found, 
 Far as, far as the curse was found. 
 He rules the world with truth and grace, 
 And gives to nations proof 
 The glories of His righteousness, 
 And wonders of His love; 
 And wonders of His love; 
 And wonders, wonders of His love. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High, 
 While Israel spreads abroad 
 Like stars that glitter in the sky, 
 And ever worship God, 
 And ever worship God, 
 And ever, and ever worship God

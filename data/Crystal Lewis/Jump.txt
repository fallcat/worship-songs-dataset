At the final hurdle of a long, long race 
 With the pack nippin' at your heels 
 Would you spring into action for the final push 
 Or stop for a rest on the field. 
 Just like that race you could slacken your pace 
 Fall in sin and be left behind 
 Or dig down deep for the will to compete 
 And hear the Father say, "Well done," as you cross that finish line you'd better 
 Jump! Get to it! 
 Don't you know this isn't a game. 
 You'd better Jump! Just do it! 
 Dedicate your heart to Him 
 Come on and Jump! 
 With a high rise fire crawling right up your back 
 As you freeze at the window sill. 
 Would you leap to your rescue waiting down below 
 Or stay there burn and be killed. 
 Just like that fire you could fret and perspire 
 Hesitate and you'll pay the price 
 The alternative is the desire to live 
 Fall into the Father's arms and receive eternal life 
 Jump! Get to it! 
 Don't you know this isn't a game. 
 You'd better Jump! Just do it! 
 Dedicate your heart to Him 
 Come on and Jump!

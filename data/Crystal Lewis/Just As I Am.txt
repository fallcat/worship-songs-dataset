Just as I am, without one plea, 
 But that Thy blood was shed for me, 
 And that Thou bidst me come to Thee, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 Just as I am, and waiting not 
 To rid my soul of one dark blot, 
 To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 Just as I am, though tossed about 
 With many a conflict, many a doubt, 
 Fightings and fears within, without, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind; 
 Sight, riches, healing of the mind, 
 Yea, all I need in Thee to find, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, 
 Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; 
 Because Thy promise I believe, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 Jut as I am, Thy love unknown 
 Hath broken every barrier down; 
 Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 
 Just as I am, of that free love 
 The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove, 
 Here for a season, then above, 
 O Lamb of God, I come

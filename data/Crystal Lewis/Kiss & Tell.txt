Kiss 
 A kiss is a clue to the heart 
 A window that let's light impart 
 Or hides you away in the dark 
 The dark can consume and it will 
 Your will an enemy still 
 And it will be forever until 
 You kiss and tell 
 Me what you're thinking 
 Kiss and tell 
 Me what you believe 
 Are you brave enough 
 Have faith enough 
 Truth 
 The truth is the one thing we trust 
 Worthy of all that we must 
 Give up to gain no matter what 
 What if the road's not paved with ease 
 What if storms are all you see 
 Will you kiss and leave 
 Or stay and still believe 
 Kiss and tell me what you're thinking 
 Kiss and tell me what you believe 
 Are you brave enough 
 Have faith enough 
 To stay oh, yeah yeah yeah 
 Kiss and tell me what you're thinking 
 Kiss and tell me what you believe 
 Are you brave enough 
 Have faith enough 
 To stay

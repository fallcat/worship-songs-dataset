Ooh 
 This is for that little child with no father 
 For that man that doesn't have a place to stay 
 For that little boy living with AIDS 
 Can I tell you a story, tell you a story 
 You can lean on me 
 There's a man (oh yes) 
 Standing on the corner 
 He has no home 
 He has no food 
 And his blue skies are gone (yes it is) 
 Can't you hear him cryin' out 
 And there's a girl 
 Searching for a father and a friend 
 Praying that the storm someday will end 
 But instead of walking away 
 Open up your heart and say 
 I am here 
 You don't have to worry 
 I can see... 
 I can see your tears 
 ...Your tears 
 I'll be there in a hurry when you call 
 Yes I will 
 Friends are there to catch you when you fall 
 Here's my shoulder 
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me 
 Halleluia 
 Ooh 
 Listen 
 Oh, there's a child 
 Who is sick and begging to be free 
 But there is no cure for his disease 
 He looks up to his mother and 
 As she hold (holds), his hand (hand) 
 Prayin' that someday 
 The sun will shine again 
 And the pain? 
 And the pain will end 
 Pain will end... Come on 
 I am here 
 I am here 
 You don't have to worry 
 You don't have to worry 
 I can see... 
 I see... 
 ...Your tears 
 ...Your tears, yeah 
 I'll be there in a hurry when you call 
 I'll be there in a hurry when you call 
 Friends are there to catch you when you fall 
 I'm your friend and I'll catch you when, when, when you fall 
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me 
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me 
 Tell me, how can I, how can I love Jesus 
 When I've never seen His face 
 Yeah, I see you dying 
 And I turn and walk away 
 So hold my hand 
 Ooh 
 Let me take you to a friend of mine 
 He's waiting just to ease your troubled mind 
 Yeah, yeah, He loves you more than you'll ever know 
 'Stead of walking away 
 Open up 
 Open up your heart and say 
 Come on 
 I am here 
 I am here 
 You don't have to worry 
 I can see your tears 
 I'll be there in a hurry when you call 
 Alleluia 
 Ah 
 When you call, friends will be there to catch you when, catch you when you fall 
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me 
 Thank you Jesus, yeah 
 Oh Yeah, oh yeah 
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me 
 Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me 
 You can lean on me 
 Lean on me, yeah, yeah Intro 
 Ooh

I can see Him in the man with no shoes upon his feet 
 I can see Him in the child with nothing left to eat 
 I can see Him in the boy that doesn't have a friend 
 I can see Him in the preacher man whose problems never end 
 If you lose your life you will gain it back 
 Surely in the end 
 For what you've done unto the least of men 
 You've done it unto Him 
 If you lose your life you will gain it back 
 Surely in the end 
 For what you've done unto the least of men 
 You've done it unto Him 
 I was tired and you came to me 
 You smiled and gave me rest 
 I was a stranger in a lonely town 
 But you treated me like a guest 
 I had trouble and you came to me 
 To lift me up in prayer 
 I grew old and you read to me 
 You made me feel like people still cared 
 If you lose your life you will gain it back 
 Surely in the end 
 For what you've done unto the least of men 
 You've done it unto Him 
 If you lose your life you will gain it back 
 Surely in the end 
 For what you've done unto the least of men 
 You've done it unto Him

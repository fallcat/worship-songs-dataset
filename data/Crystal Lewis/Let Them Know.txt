I was dreamin' about a time I've waited for 
 Christ was coming on his way 
 On his way to take us home 
 All of my friends stood and watched as I went by 
 I never told them the reason Jesus had to die 
 Just then I awoke to see-oppurtunity 
 If you love someone, if you love somebody 
 Let it show, let them know of the fathers love 
 Tell them of his glory; let them know 
 Conversation-You say so much but nothings said 
 Confrontation-What's going on inside their head? 
 Hesitation-There's no easy way to start 
 Determination-Just let the Lord speak through your heart 
 Don't pass up opportunity-set them free!

I'm coming to this place 
 Tired and far away 
 I'm longing for some peace 
 To help me through this day 
 So here's my life Lord, Here's my plea! 
 I want to see your face 
 Feel your warm embrace 
 And lay here like a child 
 In your loving arms 
 Where I'm safe from harm, 
 And the sorrow fades away 
 There's healing in your name 
 So I cry out to you, 
 Forgiveness is your way 
 Won't you see my through 
 So here's my life Lord, here's my plea! 
 I want to see your face 
 Feel your warm embrace 
 And lay here like a child 
 In your loving arms 
 Where I'm safe from harm, 
 And the sorrow fades away

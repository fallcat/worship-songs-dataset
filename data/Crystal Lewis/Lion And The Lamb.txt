Who is He... The mightiest of all 
 Who is He... Creation trembles at His call 
 Who is He... The lowly sacrifice, who paid a victims price 
 His name is Jesus 
 Jesus... From the Father's own right hand 
 Jesus... Son of God and son of man 
 Jesus... Who died and rose again 
 Jesus... He's the Lion and the Lamb 
 Who is He... With the power none can tame 
 Who is He... That every foe would fear his name 
 Who is he... Who was humbly led away, to suffer that dark day 
 His name is Jesus 
 Jesus... From the Father's own right hand 
 Jesus... Son of God and son of man 
 Jesus... Who died and rose again 
 Jesus... He's the Lion and the Lamb 
 He's the lion and the lamb 
 He's the Lamb that was slain 
 He's the Lion that reigns 
 My Savior and King both the same 
 Who is He... With the eyes that burn like fire 
 Who is He... Oh the wonder He inspires 
 Who is He... Who bore the guilt and shame 
 For those who've gone astray 
 His name is Jesus 
 Jesus... From the Father's own right hand 
 Jesus... Son of God and son of man 
 Jesus... Who died and rose again 
 Jesus... He's the Lion and the Lamb

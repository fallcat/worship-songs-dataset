Jackie had a dad who didn't have Jesus 
 He had no hope no reason to live 
 One day she told him of 
 The peace He brings us 
 The freedom God so freely gives 
 For fifteen years 
 Eight of those were Jackie's 
 He wouldn't hear and he wouldn't see 
 Then before he died he asked Jackie 
 Who's this man who'll set me free? 
 Ooh little Jackie 
 Ooh little Jackie 
 He's the man who gave his life for me 
 Not just a man in fact a King 
 The blind see His mercy 
 The deaf hear His voice 
 I know Him she said, and He wants to know you 
 Jackie saw her dad go home to see Jesus 
 Now she watches a dying world 
 So much in need of hope and of rest 
 So much in need of the peace she knows 
 Oh little Jackie 
 Oh little Jackie 
 The world despises, the foolish reign 
 They mock the Word of God we live 
 Even though they have to hate Him 
 He loves them so that's who Jesus is

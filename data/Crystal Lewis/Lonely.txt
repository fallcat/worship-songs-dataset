My soul, my soul 
 Watch over me 
 My Father, my Father 
 If it's possible let this pass from me 
 In your deepest plan I'll surely stand 
 It's not how I feel but oh do Thy will 
 I have asked You, I have asked You, I have asked You again 
 The hour is at hand for the Son of man 
 Lonely, was the hour 
 Lonely, you made it through 
 Hallelujah! 
 Lonely, was the hour 
 Lonely, you made it through 
 Hallelujah! 
 I have always found that your love 
 Would be enough for me 
 I have always found that your love 
 Would be enough for me D G It will be, it will be 
 It must happen this way 
 Everyday, everyday 
 I would teach and you would let me stay 
 All my friends this time have left my side 
 It had happened then to prove the words of other men 
 I will tell you, I will tell you, I will tell you again 
 You will see the Son of Man at the right hand 
 Lonely, was the hour 
 Lonely, you made it through 
 Hallelujah! 
 Lonely, was the hour 
 Lonely, you made it through 
 Hallelujah! 
 I have always found that your love 
 Would be enough for me 
 I have always found that your love 
 Would be enough for me 
 Lonely, was the hour 
 Lonely, you made it through 
 Hallelujah! 
 Lonely, was the hour 
 Lonely, you made it through 
 Hallelujah! 
 I have always found that your love 
 Would be enough for me 
 I have always found that your love 
 Would be enough for me

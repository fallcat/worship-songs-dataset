Though I can't see Your holy face 
 And Your throne in heaven above 
 It seems so far away 
 Though I can't touch your nail scarred hands 
 I have a deep and unspeakable joy 
 That makes my faith to stand 
 Lord, I believe in You 
 I'll always believe in You 
 Though I can't see you with my eyes 
 Deep in my heart 
 Your presence I find 
 Lord, I believe in You 
 And I'll keep my trust in You 
 Let the whole world say what they may 
 No one can take this joy away 
 Lord, I believe 
 Born from above 
 You are Gods only chosen one 
 You're the one and only true way 
 To the Fathers heart 
 You died for all sin 
 Then you rose and now live again 
 Conquering death and the grave 
 So that I might live 
 Lord, I believe in You 
 I'll always believe in You 
 Though I can't see you with my eyes 
 Deep in my heart 
 Your presence I find 
 Lord, I believe in You 
 And I'll keep my trust in You 
 Let the whole world say what they may 
 No one can take this joy away 
 Lord, I believe

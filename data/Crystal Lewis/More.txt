Dirty devices, divide and devise 
 A plan to diminish our creative minds 
 Distorting our views, of ourselves and our minds 
 Destructive dirty devices 
 Destructive dirty devices 
 We are more than we know 
 We are more than we know 
 We are meant for more than this world would suppose 
 We are more than we know 
 I believe in all things spiritual 
 That God is in this place 
 Always watching, guiding, 
 Knowing what the look on my face means 
 Knowing every thought before I think it and it's gone 
 Knowing each word I'm gonna say before it rolls off my tongue 
 Knowing each word I'm gonna say before it rolls off my tongue 
 We are more than we know 
 We are more than we know 
 We are meant for more than this world would suppose 
 We are more than we know 
 Listen and let go, You will hear and know 
 You'll see and believe, You can walk on water

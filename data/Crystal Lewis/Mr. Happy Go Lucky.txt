Well I know this guy, always bouncin' around 
 He don't let the world's troubles bring him down 
 Mr. Happy go lucky (What's his name?) 
 Mr. Happy go lucky (What's his name?) 
 Mr. Happy go lucky (What's his name?) 
 Mr. Happy go lucky (What's his name?) 
 Mr. Happy go lucky, always singin' a song 
 I first met that man, outside the five and dime 
 He was always saying that his life was fine 
 Everytime I see him walkin' down the street, he's always acting so fine 
 When I see the smile on his face, I want to put one on mine

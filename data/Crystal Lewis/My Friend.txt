Thank-you 
 For being my friend 
 For being the one 
 On whom I depend 
 We've been a team 
 Come rain or shine 
 Come win or lose 
 What's yours has been mine 
 I love you my friend 
 For giving to me 
 For being my confidant 
 For letting me be me 
 For sharing your heart 
 For taking a stand 
 I want to be like you 
 I love you my friend 
 I'll never forget 
 The secrets we kept 
 The stories we told 
 The nights we never slept 
 The tears that we cried 
 The heartaches we shared 
 Somehow gave me hope 
 When it seemed no one cared 
 I love you my friend 
 For giving to me 
 For being my confidant 
 For letting me be me 
 For sharing your heart 
 For taking a stand 
 I want to be like you 
 I love you my friend 
 There've been times 
 I felt my life 
 Was coming to an end 
 You stood by me my friend 
 I thank God 
 For sending someone 
 Like you to me 
 I'm glad we've got each other 
 The years will pass 
 And times will change 
 But one thing will always 
 Stay the same 
 We'll always be friends 
 I love you my friend 
 For giving to me 
 For being my confidant 
 For letting me be me 
 For sharing your heart 
 For taking a stand 
 I want to be like you 
 I love you my friend

For I know my redeemer lives 
 And in the end He will stand on the earth 
 For I know my redeemer lives 
 And in the end He will reign on the earth 
 Though my flesh it be destroyed 
 Yet with my eyes I will see God 
 For I know my redeemer lives 
 And I will stand with Him on that day 
 For I know my redeemer lives 
 And I will stand with Him on that day 
 Oh my heart it yearns within me 
 For the day when Jesus returns 
 Oh my heart it yearns within me 
 For the day when Jesus shall reign 
 Though my flesh it be destroyed 
 Yet with my eyes I will see God 
 For I know that my redeemer lives 
 And I will stand with Him on that day 
 For I know that my redeemer lives 
 And I will stand with Him on that day

How can I say thanks 
 For the things you have done for me 
 Things so undeserved 
 Yet You gave to prove your love for me 
 The voices of a million angels 
 Could not express my gratitude 
 All that I am and ever hope to be 
 I owe it all to thee 
 To God be the glory, to God be the glory 
 To God be the glory, 
 For the things He has done 
 With His blood He has saved me 
 With His power He has raised me 
 To God be the glory, 
 For the things He has done 
 Just let me live my life 
 And let it be pleasing Lord to thee 
 And should I gain any praise 
 Let it go to Calvary 
 With His blood He has saved me 
 With His power He has raised me 
 To God be the glory 
 For the things He has done 
 To God be the glory, to God be the glory 
 To God be the glory, 
 For the things He has done 
 With His blood He has saved me 
 With His power He has raised me 
 To God be the glory, 
 For the things He has done

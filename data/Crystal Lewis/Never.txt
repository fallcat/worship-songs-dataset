Send forth the river 
 Of God within my heart 
 Let it wash over my soul 
 With the water of the word 
 Let the river rise so high 
 That I be caught up in it 
 Let it flow and with it bring 
 Life and healing 
 Set my sails to catch 
 Your Spirit in my life 
 Let the wind of Your love 
 Take me away 
 Over the ocean of forgiveness 
 Let me bathe in Your mercy, soak in Your grace 
 No, No, No never 
 Never, no never 
 Jesus will never let me go 
 The Bible tells me so 
 No, No, No never 
 Never, no never 
 He promised I'd never be alone 
 This I know 
 Make me to be an open vessel 
 Fill me with your Spirit oh Lord 
 Restore in my a willingness to pour it out 
 Create in me an overflow of pure and perfect faith 
 No, No, No never 
 Never, no never 
 Jesus will never let me go 
 The Bible tells me so 
 No, No, No never 
 Never, no never 
 He promised I'd never be alone 
 This I know 
 Bring me to a place of surrender 
 To the place of letting it all go 
 Your will is all I long for 
 Your plan for me my goal 
 This little one to Him belongs 
 In my weakness, He is strong

I used to be mean 
 Couldn't care 'bout a thing 
 Living for me 
 And all of my needs 
 I was self-serving 
 Yet desperate and hurting 
 In need to be 
 Not the same 
 No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Jesus has changed me 
 Not the same 
 Ooh, it's all for You 
 All that I am, all that I do 
 I've given it to 
 Life giving truth 
 I've come to believe 
 I can be new 
 You took all my sin 
 Gave peace within 
 Took all my doubt 
 Assured me of Him 
 He's now why I live 
 My life is his 
 Not the same 
 No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Jesus has changed me 
 Not the same 
 All that I am and all that I wanted to be 
 All that has changed for I am not the same anymore 
 All that I am and all that I ever will be 
 He's now why I live 
 My life is His

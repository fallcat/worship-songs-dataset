There is a Name I love to hear, 
 I love to sing its worth; 
 It sounds like music in my ears, 
 The sweetest Name on earth. 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 Because He first loved me 
 It tells me of a Savior's love, 
 Who died to set me free; 
 It tells me of a Savior's blood, 
 The sinners' perfect plea. 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 Because He first loved me 
 It tells me what my Father hath 
 In store for every day, 
 And though I tread a darksome path, 
 Yields sunshine all the way. 
 It tells of one whose loving heart 
 Can feel my deepest woe; 
 Who in each sorrow bears 
 A part that none can bear below. 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 Because He first loved me 
 Jesus love me for the bible tells me so 
 Little ones to him belong 
 They are weak but he is strong 
 There is a name I love to hear 
 I love to sing it's worth 
 Sounds like music in my ear 
 The sweetest name on earth 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 O how I love Jesus, 
 Because He first loved me

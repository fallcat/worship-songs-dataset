O holy night, 
 The stars are brightly shining; 
 It is the night of 
 Our dear Savior's birth! 
 Long lay the world 
 In sin and error pining, 
 Till He appeared 
 And the soul felt its worth. 
 A thrill of hope, 
 The weary world rejoices, 
 For yonder breaks 
 A new and glorious morn. 
 Fall on your knees, 
 O hear the angel voices! 
 O night divine, 
 O night when Christ was born! 
 O night divine, O night, 
 O night divine! 
 Led by the light of Faith 
 Serenely beaming, 
 With glowing hearts 
 By His cradle we stand. 
 So led by light of a star 
 Sweetly gleaming, 
 Here came the wise men 
 From Orient land. 
 The King of Kings lay thus 
 In lowly manger, 
 In all our trials 
 Born to be our Friend! 
 He knows our need, 
 To our weakness no stranger; 
 Behold your King! 
 Before the lowly bend! 
 Behold your King! your King! 
 Before Him bend. 
 Truly He taught us 
 To love one another; 
 His law is love and 
 His gospel is peace. 
 Chains shall He break 
 For the slave is our brother 
 And in His name 
 All oppression shall cease. 
 Sweet hymns of joy in 
 Grateful chorus raise we, 
 Let all within us 
 Praise His holy name! 
 Christ is the Lord, 
 Oh praise His name forever, 
 His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim 
 His pow'r and glory 
 Evermore proclaim.

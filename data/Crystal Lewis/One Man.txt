We are all living a borrowed time 
 We all have hopes and dreams 
 Our future is fading rapidly 
 Only a few will see 
 Life is not always what it seems 
 Even the best will fall 
 Why does our past bring us to see 
 We are in such great need 
 What do you want from me 
 Even the best can see 
 My life is better now 
 One man who takes care of us 
 One man who is big enough 
 One man who sees every hurt 
 One man who can change th earth 
 One man who takes all the pain 
 Of everyone who calls his name 
 One man 
 One man 
 One man 
 We all want more than what we need 
 We want to win the race 
 People are falling far behind 
 Aren't we the chosen kind 
 Broken sould who can't keep pace 
 Longing to find their way 
 Looking for someone who can lead 
 A lonely world in need 
 What do you want from me 
 Even the best can see 
 My life is better now 
 One man who takes care of us 
 One man who is big enough 
 One man who sees every hurt 
 One man who can change th earth 
 One man who takes all the pain 
 Of everyone who calls his name 
 One man 
 One man 
 One man 
 What do you want from me 
 Even the best can see 
 My life is better mow 
 What do I have to do 
 I'm trying to reach for you 
 I want you to know this man 
 One man who takes care of us 
 One man who is big enough 
 One man who sees every hurt 
 One man who can change th earth 
 One man who takes all the pain 
 Of everyone who calls his name 
 One man 
 One man 
 One man

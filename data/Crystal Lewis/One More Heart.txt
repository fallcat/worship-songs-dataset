Wanting for so long to let love in 
 The notion almost left behind 
 But here I am with a longing inside 
 Opened up only to find 
 There's room for one more heart 
 To beat inside my own 
 So come in and make yourself at home 
 There's room to take a chance 
 On one more brand new start 
 There's room for one more heart 
 Lonliness had tossed within 
 An ocean of unending time 
 But there you are with your arms opened wide 
 Waiting for our love to shine 
 There's room for one more heart 
 To beat inside my own 
 So come in and make yourself at home 
 There's room to take a chance 
 On one more brand new start 
 There's room for one more heart 
 When you arrived like an angel from afar 
 There was room for one more heart 
 In the shape of everything you are 
 There's room for one more heart 
 To beat inside my own 
 So come in and make yourself at home 
 There's room to take a chance 
 On one more brand new start 
 There's room for one more heart

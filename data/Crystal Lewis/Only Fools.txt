Only fools 
 Follow gold 
 Only wise men know 
 I'm no fool 
 You've changed my point of view 
 To be kind is a quality 
 That I richly desire 
 It is better 
 To be poor than a liar 
 I no longer see things controlling me 
 You have spoken, I have listened 
 Only fools believe in only what they see 
 The wise are rich indeed 
 What a friend we have in Jesus 
 He hears all our cries 
 If you listen 
 You'll hear him crying too 
 I no longer see things controlling me 
 You have spoken, I have listened 
 Only fools believe in only what they see 
 The wise are rich indeed 
 Only fools follow gold 
 Only wise men know 
 I'm no fool 
 You've changed my point of view 
 I no longer see things controlling me 
 You have spoken, I have listened 
 Only fools believe in only what they see 
 The wise are rich indeed 
 I no longer see things controlling me 
 You have spoken, I have listened 
 Only fools believe in only what they see 
 The wise are rich indeed

When there's music all around 
 No conductor in the stand 
 When the singing is like sobbing 
 With no method to the sound 
 There's a voice that reminds me not to fret 
 It's the one that rings out above the rest 
 There's a song, sets me free 
 Like a rhythm over me 
 There's a chain, a chain of voices 
 Looking for a harmony 
 There's a sound like a trumpet 
 Blowing out across the sea 
 There's a beat from the center of the wind 
 With the heat from the keeper of the flame 
 There's a breath moving sweetly 
 Like a rhythm over me 
 And it is over me 
 When I feel I cannot move 
 It always carries me 
 It is over me 
 Like a rhythm over me 
 When I'm riding with the angels 
 With my feel like the wind 
 When I'm riding with the angels 
 With my wings like the eagle 
 There's a voice that reminds me not to fret 
 It's the one that rings out above the rest 
 There's a song, sets me free 
 Like a rhythm over me

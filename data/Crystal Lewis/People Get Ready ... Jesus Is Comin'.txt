Lord I'm ready now 
 I'm waiting for Your triumphant return 
 You're coming so soon 
 This world has nothing for me 
 I find my peace and joy solely in You 
 Only in You 
 I want the world to see that 
 You're alive and living well in me 
 Let me be a part of the harvest 
 For the days are few 
 Hes coming soon 
 People get ready Jesus is comin' 
 Soon we'll be going home 
 People get ready Jesus is coming 
 To take from the world His own 
 There will be a day 
 When we will be divided right and left 
 For those who know Him 
 And those who do not know 
 Those who know Him well 
 Will meet Him in the air 
 Hallelujah 
 God is with us 
 Those who do not know 
 They will hear "Depart, I knew you not" 
 For my friends you see 
 There will be a day when well be counted 
 So know Him well, know Him well 
 People get ready Jesus is comin' 
 Soon we'll be going home 
 People get ready Jesus is coming 
 To take from the world His own 
 People get ready Jesus is comin' 
 Soon we'll be going home 
 People get readyJesus is coming 
 To take from the world His own

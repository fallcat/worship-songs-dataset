Precious Lord take my hand 
 Lead me on 
 Help me stand 
 I am tired, I am weak, I am worn 
 Through the storm, through the night 
 Lead me on, to the light 
 Take my hand 
 Precious Lord 
 And lead me home 
 Precious Lord 
 You're the one 
 That I built my life on 
 You're my rock 
 You're my hope 
 You are my song 
 You picked me up, made me strong 
 When my way was all wrong 
 Here's my hand 
 Precious Lord 
 Now lead me home 
 When my way grows drear 
 Precious Lord, linger near 
 When my life is almost gone 
 Hear my cry, hear my call 
 Take my hand lest I fall 
 Take my hand 
 Precious Lord 
 And lead me home 
 Take my hand 
 Precious Lord 
 And lead me home

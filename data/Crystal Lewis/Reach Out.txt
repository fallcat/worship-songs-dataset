I've felt this way for a while 
 Like time is stealing my smile away 
 Like darkness holds the day 
 I'm running at a break-neck pace 
 As if in a race 
 But what do I stand to win 
 To cross the line again 
 I'm too tired to sleep 
 I need to find peace 
 Is this where my rest begins 
 When I reach out to you 
 Reach out to you (there I find a hiding place) 
 Reach out to you (there I find a source of strength) 
 Reach out to you 
 So busy I can barely breathe 
 Temptation seems 
 To keep me off of my knees 
 Yet that is where I want to be 
 I'm sitting in the shallow end 
 A pool of good intent 
 Distraction has my feet 
 It pulls me underneath 
 Now it's sink or swim 
 Throw the life line in 
 God show me what I should do 
 When I reach out to you 
 Reach out to you (there I find a joy divine) 
 Reach out to you (there I find a peace of mind) 
 Reach out to you 
 Reach out to you 
 Reach out to you 
 Reach out to you 
 I have failed and yet 
 Still you give, I get 
 I remain amazed at that

My daddy always told that his mamma always said 
 "No matter what you become in this life, 
 Whether big or small 'n' the eyes of men 
 You'd remember who you are in the eyes of God" 
 Remember who you are in Jesus 
 He sees you as his own it pleases Him to know that you 
 Remember who you are in Jesus 
 It's His name you wear 
 My child, remember who you are 
 So I am giving you now 
 This legacy of love 
 The greatest gift that I can give you is to pray 
 That whether big or small 
 In the eyes of men, You'd remember who you are 
 In the eyes of God 
 Remember who you are in Jesus 
 He sees you as his own it pleases Him to know that you 
 Remember who you are in Jesus 
 It's His name you wear 
 My child, remember who you are 
 There is a song living deep within your soul 
 As life goes on that soul begins to grow 
 Until the day when the world will need to know 
 Who you are... Remember who you are

He's the man who'd bleed for me 
 Not making a sound or cry 
 He suffered as a guilty man 
 His innocence was the crime 
 While other said come down and save yourself 
 He was saving my life 
 Remember, I will remember 
 What He did for me 
 Remember, I will remember 
 How He died for me 
 Early Sunday morning came 
 The stone had been rolled away 
 They stepped inside the empty grave 
 Alone in dismay 
 They were thinking he was gone 
 They were not believing 
 Death of the lamb did bring 
 Forgiveness and healing 
 Why do you seek Him here among the dead? 
 He is risen! 
 Remember, I will remember 
 What He did for me 
 Remember, I will remember 
 How He died for me 
 I know it's You who lives inside of me 
 I know it's true the peace of mind you bring to me 
 Your sacrifice has now set me free... I will always... 
 Remember, I will remember 
 What He did for me 
 Remember, I will remember 
 How He died for me

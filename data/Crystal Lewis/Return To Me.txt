I remember when You first loved me 
 And with me was all you wanted to be 
 Now fallen in to the lie within 
 Seems you're too far gone to come back to me 
 Don't be discouraged dear one 
 For my forgiveness awaites you here 
 Return to me 
 Return to me 
 I'm longing for the day when you will 
 Return to me 
 Return to me 
 I love you still 
 You defy me 
 Yet you hide from me 
 Our sacred vow was broken with another choice 
 As you're running I'm still loving 
 Seems that you don't recognize my voice 
 I will continue crying, calling until you hear me say 
 Return to me 
 Return to me 
 I'm longing for the day when you will 
 Return to me 
 Return to me 
 I love you still 
 Return to, come back to 
 My voice that was so familiar to you 
 Don't let it fade away 
 Return to me 
 Return to me 
 I'm longing for the day when you will 
 Return to me 
 Return to me 
 I love you still

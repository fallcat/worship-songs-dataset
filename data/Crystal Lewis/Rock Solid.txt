Slippin' down the road of romance 
 Don't get caught in a hit and run 
 When your love is fallin' too fast 
 I know a straight up way to go 
 You don't have to lose control 
 Get up on solid ground my friend 
 Jesus is rock solid, depend on Him 
 Get up on solid ground my friend 
 Jesus is rock solid, He'll be with you till the end 
 Your faith and trust is shaken 
 'Cause friends will let you down 
 Your heroes fall you feel forsaken 
 I know a friend who'll be around 
 He will never let you down. 
 Get up on solid ground my friend 
 Jesus is rock solid, depend on Him 
 Get up on solid ground my friend 
 Jesus is rock solid, He'll be with you till the end 
 I look to my left, I look to my right 
 I'm surrounded by darkness 
 But still hold the light 
 Yeah it's a fight, but God as my might 
 That's how I know everything is all right 
 You say your marriage is crumblin' 
 Your mate has left you 
 Well, this is my advice on what you should do 
 Cast it on Jesus because He knows 
 Like before we know 
 How our lives should go 
 So don't worry be happy just like the song 
 There's always joy at the end of a storm 
 Be reborn into Jesus and expect a squeeze 
 But the battles like fought down on your knees 
 So would you please 
 Hold on tight 
 You're almost through the night 
 You gotta walk by faith and not by sight 
 From dusk to dawn your name will be exalted 
 Man what you call it, rock solid.

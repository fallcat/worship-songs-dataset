Runnin' in and out of time 
 Spendin' every dime 
 Feeling all alone at night 
 Wonderin' if it's all so right 
 And every day you work so hard 
 Playin' every single card 
 (But) Deep inside you search for more 
 Can you find an open door? 
 Who is it for? 
 Runnin' when there's not a finish line 
 Stop your runnin' your just runnin' out of time 
 Settle down and catch your breath 
 Before you run yourself to death 
 There is nothing you can hide 
 He's always been there by your side 
 It's something only you can choose 
 You haven't got a thing to lose 
 If you let go, he'll give you more 
 You're atnding at an open door 
 You know who it's for 
 Runnin' when there's not a reason why 
 Runnin' you're just runnin' for a lie 
 Runnin' when there's not a finish line 
 Stop your runnin' your just runnin' out of time 
 Settle down and catch your breath 
 Before you run yourself to death 
 There is nothing you can hide 
 He's always been there by your side 
 It's something only you can choose 
 You haven't got a thing to lose 
 If you let go, he'll give you more 
 You're atnding at an open door 
 You know who it's for 
 Runnin' when there's not a reason why 
 Runnin' you're just runnin' for a lie

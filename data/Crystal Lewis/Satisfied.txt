Sitting in traffic too long 
 Listening to my favorite song 
 Watching all the cars go by 
 My mind wonders and wonders why 
 I can't drive a car like that 
 I can't have a little more cash 
 For a bigger house with much more room 
 For more leather jackets, hats and dreses 
 High-heel shoes 
 I bring myself back to reality 
 What was I thinking I have everything I need 
 I don't want for anything at all 
 I'm satisfied 
 Satisfied (love your life) 
 Satisfied (laugh a lot) 
 Satisfied (be content) 
 Satisfied (with what you've got) 
 I've been given sweet salvation 
 Forgiveness came and rescued me 
 I am wrapped up in redemption 
 I was guilty- now I'm free 
 I think about the air I breathe 
 I think about the song that I sing 
 I think of the friends and family 
 I think what I've got I like a lot it's all I need 
 Don't let this world trick you into thinking 
 You need what it's got to be happy 
 Satisfaction comes from something the world cannot provide 
 Be satisfied 
 Satisfied (love your life) 
 Satisfied (laugh a lot) 
 Satisfied (be content) 
 Satisfied (with what you've got) 
 Everything we really need 
 From now until eternity 
 God already knows we need it 
 Oh, yeah my God already knows we need it 
 Stop your eyes from darting here and there 
 Trust your desires to his care 
 His promises are true 
 Satisfied (love your life) 
 Satisfied (laugh a lot) 
 Satisfied (be content) 
 Satisfied (with what you've got)

Are you going through a dry spell? 
 Yes, I've been there before 
 Where the trees are slowly whithering 
 Where their roots cry out for more 
 Where the desert floor is dry and cracked 
 No clouds hang in the sky 
 No winter rain or spring it seems 
 No change in sight 
 But seasons change and then they pass 
 No way to know how long they'll last 
 I'd love to know the reasons why 
 But God knows 
 Seasons change and then they pass 
 No way to know how long they'll last 
 I'd love to know the reasons why 
 But God knows 
 Seasons change 
 Are you going through a dry spell? 
 I've been there a time before 
 Where life seems to stay the same for a while 
 You want to change but don't know how to 
 It's the place where you feel empty inside 
 Can't put your finger on the need 
 I look at God and see what I want to be 
 I look at me and see what I am 
 But seasons change and then they pass 
 No way to know how long they'll last 
 I'd love to know the reasons why 
 But God knows 
 Seasons change and then they pass 
 No way to know how long they'll last 
 I'd love to know the reasons why 
 But God knows 
 Seasons change 
 Are you going through a dry spell? 
 I was there a while ago 
 Now I've come to a place where the rain falls 
 Where the trees bear fruit and grow 
 Where I find a refuge in my God 
 It's a place of surrender I know 
 I look at God and see what I want to be 
 He looks at me and sees His own 
 But seasons change and then they pass 
 No way to know how long they'll last 
 I'd love to know the reasons why 
 But God knows 
 Seasons change and then they pass 
 No way to know how long they'll last 
 I'd love to know the reasons why 
 But God knows 
 Seasons change

Precious moments when it's just we two 
 At our secret hideaway 
 Telling secrets just talking to You 
 I love to meet you everyday 
 At our secret hideaway 
 Even those who love me most 
 Don't know me like you do 
 My darkest fears my highest hopes 
 I can tell them all to you 
 When trouble comes like a rainy day 
 I run to our secret hideaway and listen 
 You tell me what to do 
 Precious moments when it's just we two 
 At our secret hideaway 
 Telling secrets just talking to You 
 I love to meet you everyday 
 At our secret hideaway 
 At times I fail I feel so low 
 And think could you still care 
 My guilt becomes a heavy load 
 It's far too much for me to bear 
 The accuser comes tries to block my way 
 I run to our secret hideaway You'll listen 
 And forgive me when I've failed 
 Precious moments when it's just we two 
 At our secret hideaway 
 Telling secrets just talking to You 
 I love to meet you everyday 
 At our secret hideaway 
 A secret place that no one else can find 
 A place that's safe where I can leave the storm behind 
 A place of peace to ease my troubled mind 
 A place where I can feel your heart as you touch mine

Now faith is the evidence of things not seen 
 Yes, the assurance of everything that sets us free 
 So be assured that Christ will be back any day now 
 I know He's coming soon for me, are you ready? 
 Don't be fooled my friend when men say 
 I'm the one 
 Don't be fooled for by your faith 
 From your weakness you have been made strong 
 Set ya free 
 Set ya free 
 Set ya free 
 The blood will set you free 
 I'm looking for a city 
 Whose builder is the Lord 
 And nothing but the blood of Christ 
 Could give such a reward 
 Don't be fooled my friend when men say I'm the one 
 Don't be fooled for by your faith 
 From your weakness you have been made strong 
 Set ya free 
 Set ya free 
 The blood will set you free

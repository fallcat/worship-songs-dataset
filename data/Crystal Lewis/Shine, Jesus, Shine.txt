Lord the light of Your love is shining 
 In the midst of the darkness, shining 
 Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us 
 Set us free by the truth You now bring us

 Send forth Your Word, Lord And let there be light 
 Lord, I come into Your awesome presence 
 From the shadows into Your radiance 
 By the blood I may enter Your brightness 
 Search me, try me, consume all my darkness 
 Shine on me 
 Shine on me 
 Shine, Jesus, shine 
 Fill this land with the Father's glory 
 Blaze, Spirit, blaze, Set our hearts on fire 
 Flow, river, flow

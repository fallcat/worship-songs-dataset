Silent night, holy night! 
 All is calm, All is bright 
 Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child 
 Holy Infant so Tender and mild, 
 Sleep in heavenly peace, 
 Sleep in heavenly peace. 
 Silent night, holy night! 
 Shepherds quake at the sight! 
 Glories stream from heaven afar; 
 Heavenly hosts sing Al-le-lu-ia! 
 Christ the Saviour is born! 
 Christ the Saviour is born! 
 Silent night, holy night! 
 Wondrous star, lend thy light! 
 With the angels let us sing 
 Alleluia to our King! 
 Christ the Saviour is here, 
 Jesus the Saviour is here! 
 Silent night, Holy night! 
 Son of God, love's pure light 
 Radiant beams from Thy holy face, 
 With the dawn of redeeming grace, 
 Jesus Lord at thy birth; Jesus Lord at thy birth.

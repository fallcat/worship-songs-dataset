It's something that Christ did 
 When He came in my life 
 I never knew I would 
 Feel so complete inside 
 It's something that Christ did 
 When He came in my life 
 I never knew I would 
 Feel so complete inside 
 He's given brand new life to me 
 And all the things that life should be 
 I am now finding out what this world's about 
 All my friends see 
 Never ending love 
 Freely given peace from above 
 All my friends notice 
 Something new 
 Oh what a joy that I find in You 
 It's something that Christ did 
 When He came in my life 
 I never knew I would 
 Feel so complete inside 
 It's something that Christ did 
 When He came in my life 
 I never knew I would 
 Feel so complete inside 
 He's given brand new life to me 
 And all the things that life should be 
 I am now finding out what this world's about 
 It's something that Christ did 
 When He came in my life 
 I never knew I would 
 Feel so complete inside 
 It's something that Christ did 
 When He came in my life 
 I never knew I would 
 Feel so complete inside

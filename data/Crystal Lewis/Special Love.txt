I try not to cry when I'm hurting inside 
 In my eyes you'd see my frown 
 'Cause I'd know I let you down 
 But you mean more to me 
 Than just another man 
 I find in my eyes you'll see 
 I have found my special love 
 You're so special 
 Special love in my heart you'll see my true feelings inside 
 But don't you know I can't let go 
 Of the things I shouldn't hold 
 But with you holding me 
 I can see through my tears 
 And for now I'll know I'm wrapped up in Special Love 
 You're so special 
 Special love in my heart you'll see my true feelings inside 
 But don't you know I can't let go 
 Of the things I shouldn't hold 
 But with you holding me 
 I can see through my tears 
 And for now I'll know I'm wrapped up in Special Love

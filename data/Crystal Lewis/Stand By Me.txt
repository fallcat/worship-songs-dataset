When I'm walkin' by the river 
 Stand by me 
 And Jesus Christ, He's my pillow 
 Stand by me 
 When this world can be so cold 
 I've got love for Jesus in my soul 
 I need faith on this long rocky road 
 Stand by me 
 Now when the devil, devil tries to shake me 
 Stand by me 
 And when my only friend forsakes me 
 Stand by me 
 I've been travelin', travelin' through the land 
 Tryin' to do the best that I can 
 When all my friends misunderstand 
 Please stand by me 
 Now I'm travelin' through this world of trouble 
 Please stand by me 
 When I'm feelin' so alone, please stand by me 
 And when I'm comin', comin' down to die 
 Jesus you take me up high 
 And I'll wave goodbye from the sky 
 Stand by me

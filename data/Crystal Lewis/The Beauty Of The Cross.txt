King of my life I crown You now 
 You're the ruler of my heart 
 I will wear it loud 
 I will tell the whole world about You 
 You died in my place 
 You suffered all for me 
 Just so I could live 
 You were broken and bruised 
 And I will tell the whole world about You 
 The cross, stained by blood 
 The beauty of the cross 
 Healing for the lost 
 The cross, stained by blood 
 The beauty of the cross 
 Healing for the lost 
 The cross 
 King of my life I crown You now 
 You're healer I've longed for 
 Now of heaven I'm sure 
 And I will tell the whole world about You 
 Thorns on Your brow 
 Stripes on Your back 
 So innocent, You did it all for me 
 Nails in Your hands 
 Nails in Your feet 
 Sword in Your side, You did it all for me 
 You paid the cost 
 That's the beauty of the cross

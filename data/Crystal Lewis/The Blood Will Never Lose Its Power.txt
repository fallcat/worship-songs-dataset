The blood that Jesus shed for me 
 'Way back on Calvary, 
 The blood that gives me strength from day to day 
 It will never lose its power 
 It reaches to the highest mountain 
 It flows to the lowest valley 
 The blood that gives me strength from day to day 
 It will never lose its power 
 It soothes my doubt and calms my fears, 
 And it dries all my tears; 
 The Blood that gives me strength from day to day 
 It will never loose its power. 
 It reaches to the highest mountain 
 It flows to the lowest valley 
 The blood that gives me strength from day to day 
 It will never lose its power

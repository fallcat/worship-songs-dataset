As a mother awaits the birth of a newborn child 
 So shall I await the coming of my King 
 And as emotions rise and teardrops fall 
 For the joy to come 
 So I long to be forever with the One 
 He'll hold me up for all the world to see 
 A splendid crown for the King of Kings 
 Never again will I be left alone 
 He calls me His Bride 
 He'll come to take me home 
 As a Bride waits to see the face 
 Of the one she's waited for 
 So I long to see the one my sins He bore 
 And as she stands there before him 
 Ready to give herself away 
 So my Jesus gave His all for me 
 I'll thanks Him on that day when He will 
 Hold me up for all the world to see 
 A splendid crown for the King of Kings 
 Never again will I be left alone 
 He calls me His Bride 
 He'll come to take me home

WThere is a fountain 
 Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins 
 And sinners plunged, beneath that flood 
 Lose all their guilty stains 
 Lose all their guilty stains 
 Lose all their guilty stains 
 The dying thief rejoiced to see 
 That fountain in his day; 
 And there may I, tho' vile as he 
 Wash all my sins away 
 Wash all my sins away 
 Wash all my sins away; 
 And there may I, tho' vile as he, 
 Wash all my sins away. 
 E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream 
 Thy flowing wounds supply, 
 Redeeming love has been my theme, 
 And shall be till I die 
 And shall be till I die 
 And shall be till I die 
 Redeeming love has been my theme, 
 And shall be till I die.

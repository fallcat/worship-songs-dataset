Complacency can kill as a liar and a thief 
 Whispering thought of nagging tomorrows just beyond my reach 
 It's ever- always subleties seem harmless for the moment 
 It's venom is most bitter every time I give in 
 Complacency is danger in it's purest form 
 It talks me into things to which I wouldn't otherwise conform 
 Given my ability to give into the easy way 
 No wonder why my spirit hates my flesh 
 Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today 
 But when tomorrow comes I still don't want to change 
 Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder 
 With a life of sure uncertainty 
 Tomorrow may not ever even be 
 How can I combat a complacent state of mind 
 I need a constant reminder of the wrong of wasted time 
 I need to train my heart in ways of seeing heaven as my home 
 I need to take the power given as my own 
 Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today 
 But when tomorrow comes I still don't want to change 
 Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder 
 With a life of sure uncertainty 
 Tomorrow may not ever even be 
 I know what's required of me 
 I want to do right 
 I want to do, do, do right 
 What is it that's keeping me 
 From change 
 Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today 
 But when tomorrow comes I still don't want to change 
 Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder 
 With a life of sure uncertainty 
 Tomorrow may not ever even be

The situation's telling you to ease your troubled mind 
 He wants to give his love to you 
 You've known it all the time 
 Let go of what's been holding you 
 And suddenly it's clear 
 He's right here right here 
 Let him have your heart tonight 
 Consider giving up the fight 
 You've tried it all the other way 
 You finally have the chance to say 
 My Father I surrender, Father make it right 
 I know what you've been going through 
 I've seen it all before 
 I used to feel the way you do 
 I wasn't really sure 
 The doubts I had are faded now 
 He took them all away 
 On that day so I pray 
 Let him have your heart tonight 
 Consider giving up the fight 
 You've tried it all the other way 
 You finally have the chance to say 
 My Father I surrender, Father make it right 
 I know what you've been going through 
 I've seen it all before 
 I used to feel the way you do 
 I wasn't really sure 
 The doubts I had are faded now 
 He took them all away 
 On that day so I pray

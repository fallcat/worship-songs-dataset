Close your eyes 
 Take a step 
 It's okay I know where we're going 
 Don't fret 
 I've been before 
 Through these valleys 
 Down these long and dangerous roads 
 Yet dark as they seem 
 Trust me 
 Though you can't see 
 You can trust me 
 The way may be steep 
 You can trust me 
 Let me lead 
 Trust me 
 Open your eyes 
 But don't let go of my hand 
 Let your tears give way to smile 
 See the joy inside your trial 
 Don't worry 
 You're safe with me around 
 Rest assured I'm on your side 
 I won't let you hit the ground 
 Close as it seems 
 Trust me 
 Though you can't see 
 You can trust me 
 The way may be steep 
 You can trust me 
 Let me lead 
 Trust me 
 See I know that what's in front of you isn't always clear 
 But you must believe it in your heart that I'm here 
 I am here Oh 
 Trust me 
 Though you can't see 
 You can trust me 
 The way may be steep 
 You can trust me 
 Let me lead 
 Trust me

Searchin' all night to find a reason why 
 I should hold back my love from you 
 And let my fear breakthrough 
 You know he's got you in this season 
 Waiting for love to turn your heart around 
 So don't all of your life living out on your own 
 I know what you say is true 
 He will never let you spend one more night all alone 
 Lord I do believe in you 
 I've tried so hard to find the answers 
 But all I've found is a lonely road 
 I don't know where to go 
 Well I know that I don't have all the answers 
 But Jesus is Lord and he loves you so 
 Oh my Lord, I feel how much you care 
 He'll never leave you now 
 Through all he will be there 
 Now in my life I have a reason 
 Because I know that his love is true 
 I can see him in you 
 Well, I'm glad that he brought you through this season 
 And he used his love to turn your heart around 
 So don't all of your life living out on your own

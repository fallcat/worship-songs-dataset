Deep in the dark of despair 
 Deep in my heart there's a prayer 
 That faith will reign over fear 
 That courage and strength will be mine 
 My heart is heavy I don't understand 
 Yet I know my life is in your hands 
 I realize that I am incapable 
 Of changing alone the impossible 
 But I believe in miracles 
 Together our voices will rise 
 We are not powerless in the face of fear 
 As one we will stand and make our voices clear 
 When God's people pray things will change 
 When God's people pray all the earth will obey 
 My faith can't be shaken because I have seen 
 The amazing, miraculous happens 
 When God's people pray 
 Our defense in danger 
 Our light in the midst of life 
 Our strength in the weakest moment 
 Our hope through the night, the night 
 All things are possible when we let go 
 Let go of what we can't control 
 When God's people pray things will change 
 When God's people pray all the earth will obey 
 My faith can't be shaken because I have seen 
 The amazing, miraculous happens 
 When God's people pray 
 The peace that we need will only come when we get on our knees 
 When God's people pray you know things will change 
 When God's people pray all the earth will obey 
 My faith can't be shaken because I have seen 
 The amazing, miraculous happens 
 When God's people pray

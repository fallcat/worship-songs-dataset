Sing the wondrous love of Jesus 
 Sing His mercy and His grace 
 In the mansions bright and blessed 
 He'll prepare for us a place 
 When we all get to heaven 
 What a day of rejoicing that will be 
 When we all see Jesus 
 We'll sing and shout for victory! 
 While we walk the pilgrim pathway 
 Clouds will over spread the sky 
 But when traveling days are over 
 Not a shadow, not a sigh 
 When we all get to heaven 
 What a day of rejoicing that will be 
 When we all see Jesus 
 We'll sing and shout for victory! 
 Let us then be true and faithful 
 Trusting, serving everyday 
 Just one glimpse of Him in glory 
 Will the toils of life repay 
 When we all get to heaven 
 What a day of rejoicing that will be 
 When we all see Jesus 
 We'll sing and shout for victory! 
 Onward to the prize before us 
 Soon His beauty we'll behold! 
 Soon the pearly gates will open 
 We shall tread the streets of gold 
 When we all get to heaven 
 What a day of rejoicing that will be 
 When we all see Jesus 
 We'll sing and shout for victory!

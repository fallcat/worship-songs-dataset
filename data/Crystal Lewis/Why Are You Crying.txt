I'm looking for you and I'm frightened 
 I hear you say why are you crying 
 I feel you standing next to me and I am crying 
 I am crying, I am crying, I am looking for you 
 I feel the deepest part of my life is gone 
 I was healed, I was held and I'm holding on 
 When you've been forgiven of so much you love so much 
 When you called my name right then I knew that if had to be you 
 I've seen the Lord 
 He is alive 
 I've seen the Lord 
 He is alive 
 I was there when they pierced your side 
 I was there when the held you high 
 I saw you die, They took you away then you came to me 
 I was crying and you spoke to me you said go tell the world 
 I've seen the Lord 
 He is alive 
 I've seen the Lord 
 He is alive

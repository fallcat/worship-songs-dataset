My thoughts they overwhelm me 
 My mind cannot contain 
 The pain that is within me 
 Why 
 I long for understanding 
 I live to know the peace 
 That comes with being sure of something 
 My eyes are blind to your ways oh Lord 
 Yet I've seen you love and care so 
 I rest in your knowing 
 Though I may not know 
 I take on your strength as though it were my own 
 Standing in the promises 
 Your word for me provides 
 I find therein the answer to the question 
 Why 
 My complaint today is bitter but sweet is your reply 
 My questioning still lingers though Why 
 You know each road I travel down 
 My heart and yours are one 
 I just don't see the good in all things 
 My eyes are blind to your ways oh, Lord 
 And I've seen you love and care so 
 I rest in your knowing 
 Though I may not know 
 I take on your strength as though it were my own 
 Standing in the promises 
 Your word for me provides 
 I find therein the answer to the question 
 Why 
 Through suffering and sorrow come peace beyind belief 
 For our present set of circumstances 
 Serve only to remind us of the gold we can't yet see 
 I rest in your knowing 
 Though I may not know 
 I take on your strength as though it were my own 
 Standing in the promises 
 Your word for me provides 
 I find therein the answer to the question 
 Why

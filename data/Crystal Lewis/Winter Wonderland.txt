Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, 
 In the lane, snow is glistening 
 A beautiful sight, 
 We're happy tonight, 
 Walking in a winter wonderland. 
 Gone away is the bluebird, 
 Here to stay is a new bird 
 He sings a love song, 
 As we go along, 
 Walking in a winter wonderland. 
 In the meadow we can build a snowman, 
 Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
 He'll say: Are you married? 
 We'll say: No man, 
 But you can do the job 
 When you're in town. 
 Later on, we'll conspire, 
 As we dream by the fire 
 To face unafraid, 
 The plans that we've made, 
 Walking in a winter wonderland. 
 In the meadow we can build a snowman, 
 And pretend that he's a circus clown 
 We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman, 
 Until the alligators knock him down. 
 When it snows, ain't it thrilling, 
 Though your nose gets a chilling 
 We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way, 
 Walking in a winter wonderland. 
 Walking in a winter wonderland, 
 Walking in a winter wonderland.

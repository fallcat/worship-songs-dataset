I'm free 
 'Cause Jesus loves me 
 In spite of my being weak 
 I know my Abba He delights in me 
 I see 
 Everything differently 
 My brokenness has been kissed 
 Away by His grace 
 This wisdom of tenderness is 
 Accepting that I am His 
 Taking the fierce love He gives 
 And living it 
 Living it 
 Believing that I am beloved 
 Finding I'm free because of it 
 Unconditionally giving love 
 The wisdom of tenderness 
 Do I spend my days loving? 
 Do I spend them judging? 
 Do I point my finger or open my arms 
 Do my 
 Words convey my faith 
 Do all of my ways 
 Measure up to the things that I say 
 This wisdom of tenderness is 
 Accepting that I am His 
 Taking the fierce love He gives 
 And living it 
 Living it 
 Believing that I am beloved 
 Finding I'm free because of it 
 Unconditionally giving love 
 The wisdom of tenderness 
 My faith is known 
 By the love that I'm shown 
 That is the way 
 They will know 
 I'm His own

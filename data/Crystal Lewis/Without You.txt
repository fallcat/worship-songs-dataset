Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you 
 I'm all alone no friends can come out and play 
 I need you to move me in your mystic way 
 I open up the book and I call out your name 
 Hoping that you'll hear me and you'll save me from my shame 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you 
 When I'm all alone I let out my silent cries 
 But in the midst of a crowd all they hear are lies 
 I try to hide all my pain but deep down I know 
 I need your love inside me I can't go on alone 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you I don't know what I would do 
 Without you

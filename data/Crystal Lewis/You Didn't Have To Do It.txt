I'll never know why 
 Why you did what you did 
 You didn't have to die 
 But you did 
 You hung on the cross 
 So that I wouldn't be lost 
 You took my place 
 Now You're pleadin' my case 
 You didn't have to do it 
 Oh, but I'm glad you did 
 You didn't have to do it 
 But I'm glad you did 
 You didn't have to suffer 
 You didn't have to give your life 
 You could have come down from the cross 
 But you chose to die 
 You said "Father forgive them 
 For they know not what they do" 
 An when they pierced Your side 
 You just hung bled and died 
 I'll never know why 
 Why you did what you did 
 You didn't have to die 
 But you did 
 You hung on the cross 
 So that I wouldn't be lost 
 You took my place 
 Now You're pleadin' my case 
 You didn't have to do it 
 Oh, but I'm glad you did 
 You didn't have to do it 
 But I'm glad you did 
 You didn't have to come down 
 From the Father's side 
 But because of Your love for me 
 You made the sacrifice 
 You knew no sin 
 But became sin for me 
 An all who believe 
 Can live eternally 
 I'll never know why 
 Why you did what you did 
 You didn't have to die 
 But you did 
 You hung on the cross 
 So that I wouldn't be lost 
 You took my place 
 Now You're pleadin' my case 
 You didn't have to do it 
 Oh, but I'm glad you did 
 You didn't have to do it 
 But I'm glad you did 
 You didn't have to do it 
 But I'm glad you did 
 You could have come down from the cross 
 Then my soul would be lost 
 But You chose to stay 
 And Your love made a way

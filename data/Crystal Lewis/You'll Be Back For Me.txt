You'll be back for me 
 You'll be back for me 
 I will be ready, waiting for your return 
 Look He's coming back with the clouds 
 I can hear the trumpet sound 
 An unmistakable sound 
 Shining in Your glory 
 Even those who pierced Your side will see 
 Your majesty, power, authority 
 An unmistakable sound 
 Shining in Your glory 
 You'll be back for me 
 You'll be back for me 
 I will be ready, waiting for your return 
 Here He comes to claim His chosen bride 
 All the redeemed and the purified 
 An unmistakable sound 
 Shining in Your glory 
 There will be a thousand years of peace 
 All the pain, sorry and sin will cease 
 An unmistakable sound 
 Shining in Your glory 
 You'll be back for me 
 You'll be back for me 
 I will be ready, waiting for your return

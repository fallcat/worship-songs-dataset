Considering the pain you bring 
 With every memory 
 I am alive and reconsidering 
 Every little thing 
 Just like the faded folded photograph 
 That haunts me in my dreams 
 I've got this funny fucked up feeling 
 That you're nothing like you seem 
 So won't you think of me in the silent moment 
 Before you go to sleep 
 Because I think of you with memories stolen 
 I want to lock you up 
 And keep you safe from harm 
 Just out of reach 
 Tucked away hidden and underneath 
 And I can't help but be this way 
 But I am changing every day 
 And the harder that it seems 
 It just grows that much more important to me 
 Considering the scene you're in 
 White belts and black jackets 
 Bandannas peering out of back pockets 
 Cigarettes and sunglasses 
 You've got your attitudes and your alcohol 
 Won't sleep alone tonight 
 I'd rather be alone than lonely 
 With you anti-socialites 
 I miss my dog 
 And that big blue van 
 And I hate all your friends 
 You love your scene so much so keep all that 
 And I can't help but be this way 
 But I am changing every day 
 And the harder that it seems 
 It just grows that much more import to me 
 I've got this little idea 
 To list my demands right here 
 For all the world to see 
 Just to proclaimate them 
 And encapsulate them 
 May be all the help I need 
 So here goes... 
 Not to be so negative 
 Not so argumentative 
 Not to be possessive 
 And not to be so aggressive 
 Not to be judgmental 
 And not to be so serious 
 Not to have this cloud 
 Hanging over my head 
 And not to be so lonely 
 I've got to snap out of this 
 Not to be a liar 
 And not to be so cynical 
 I've no control 
 And I can't help but be this way 
 But I am changing every day 
 And the harder that it seems 
 It just grows that much more 
 Important to me

Spirit fill this place 
 From the depth of my heart 
 I cry out to you. 
 Search me oh God, 
 As the light of your word 
 Draws me closer to you 
 I surrender to you lord 
 All that I am. 
 All that I have, 
 I give it to you. 
 In you presence I dwell 
 All that I am. 
 All that I have, 
 It is in you 
 Like the desert 
 My soul thirsts for you. 
 Let your healing water flow. 
 I am broken at your feet 
 Oh God 
 Father take everything in me 
 All I want is in you

You make Your face to shine on me 
 Now my soul knows very well 
 You lift me up an' I'm cleansed and free 
 Now my soul knows very well 
 When mountains fall, I'll stand 
 By the power of Your hand 
 And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell 
 That my soul knows very well 
 When mountains fall, I'll stand 
 By the power of Your hand 
 And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell 
 That my soul knows very well 
 It's going still 
 Joy and strength each day I find 
 That my soul knows very well 
 Forgiveness, forgiveness, hope, I know is mine 
 That my soul knows very well 
 When mountains fall, I'll stand 
 By the power of Your hand 
 And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell 
 That my soul knows very well 
 When mountains fall, I'll stand 
 By the power of Your hand 
 And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell 
 That my soul knows very well 
 When mountains fall, I'll stand 
 By the power of Your hand 
 And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell 
 That my soul knows very well 
 And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell 
 That my soul knows very well 
 And in Your heart of hearts, I'll dwell 
 That my soul knows very well

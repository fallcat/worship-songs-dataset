And you try so hard to get over it 
 But thought of it just makes you sick 
 And your friends worry cause you can not eat 
 And you carve at night and cry yourself to sleep 
 And he's long gone from here 
 It just seems so unfair 
 It'll get better I swear 
 If he can't bother writing you won't bother to call 
 And if he can't bother caring you won't bother at all 
 'Cause it's something you're born with it's something you've known 
 And it's something you'll live with and you'll live it alone 
 'Cause you're long gone from here 
 It just seems so unfair 
 It'll get better I swear 
 It's got to get easier 
 It'll get better... better I swear 
 It was an accidental suicide 
 The only help you knew how to cry 
 On a school night you broadcasted live to the whole world 
 Now the pundits all politicize 
 And the networks want it televised 
 They vie to pay the highest price for the footage 
 They put your face on TV screens 
 And on covers to sell their magazines 
 Talk shows vilify your music scene for some ratings 
 You've become the latest ad campaign 
 They're cashing in on all your pain 
 They Che you up just to make a buck 
 It's a disgusting display

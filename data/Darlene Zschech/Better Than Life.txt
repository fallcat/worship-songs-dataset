Better than the riches of this world, 
 Better than the sound of my friends' voices, 
 Better than the biggest dreams of my heart, 
 And that's just the start 
 Better than getting what I say I need, 
 Better than living the life that I want to, 
 Better than the love that anyone could give, 
 Your love is 
 And you hold me now in your arms and never let me go, 
 You Oh Lord made the sunshine, the moonlight in the night sky, 
 You give me breath and all your love, I give my heart to you because, 
 I can't stop falling in love with you, 
 I'll never stop falling in love with you.

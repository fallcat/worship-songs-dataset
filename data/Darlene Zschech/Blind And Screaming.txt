Sleep now, sweetheart. 
 I will watch over you. 
 You're sleeping deeper 
 As sleep comes creeping in the room. 
 Drift off baby. 
 I'll sit and wait for you 
 To come back and say to me 
 "I'll always stay with you." 
 So sleep now, sweetheart. 
 I will watch over you. 
 Sleep now, sweetheart. 
 I will watch over you 
 You're sleeping deeper 
 As sleep comes creeping in the room 
 When I get needy 
 I know you'll be there for me 
 When I'm blind and screaming 
 I know you'll take care of me 
 So sleep now, sweetheart 
 I will watch over you 
 Sleep now, sweetheart 
 I will watch over you

I know for sure, all of my days are held in Your hands 
 Crafted into Your perfect plan 
 You gently call me into Your presence, guiding me by Your holy spirit 
 Teach me dear Lord to live all of my life through Your eyes 
 I'm captured by Your holy calling 
 Set me apart, I know You're drawing me to Yourself 
 Lead me, Lord, I pray 
 Take me, mold me, use me, fill me 
 I give my life to the potter's hand 
 Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me 
 I give my life to the potter's hand 
 You gently call me into your presence, guiding me by Your holy spirit 
 Teach me dear lord to live through your eyes 
 I'm captured by Your holy calling 
 Set me apart, I know You're drawing me to Yourself 
 Lead me, Lord, I pray 
 Take me, mold me, use me, fill me 
 I give my life to the potter's hand 
 Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me 
 I give my life to the potter's hand

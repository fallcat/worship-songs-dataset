Though I'm many miles away 
 How could I forget the day 
 I held You close 
 And my heart was changed forever 
 Though I'm many miles away 
 I'll forever hear You say 
 I am Your child 
 Please will You love me 
 Won't you stay 
 My little one 
 I live to change Your world 
 I live to change Your world 
 Oh how You've changed my world 
 Know the kindness of God 
 Will make a way 
 There's not a day that passes by 
 When I don't hear your hungry cry 
 I won't forget You 
 Oh how I love You 
 Just be strong 
 My little one 
 I live to change Your world 
 I live to change Your world 
 Oh how You've changed my world 
 Know the kindness of God 
 Will make a way 
 He rejoices over you with singing 
 He will quiet you with His love 
 I know you'll be dancing 
 When your heart is heavy 
 Heaven will make a way 
 Just hold on 
 I live to change Your world 
 I live to change Your world 
 Oh how You've changed my world 
 Know the kindness of God 
 Will make a way 
 And when the night is long 
 And hunger is your song 
 Breathe again and know 
 To hope is never wrong 
 Change your world 
 Oceans of mercy calling 
 Heaven will rain again

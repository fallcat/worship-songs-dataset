The Holy Spirit is here 
 And His power is real 
 Anything can happen 
 And it probably will 
 Something very good 
 Something good is going on around here 
 There's a light that shines 
 To make the dark disappear 
 A power at work 
 But there's nothing to fear 
 Something very good 
 Something good is going around here 
 This is a church on fire 
 This is the Holy Spirit flame 
 We have a burning desire 
 To lit up Jesus' name 
 Let fire burn in every heart 
 To light the way, defeat the dark 
 Let the flame of love burn higher 
 This is a church 
 This is a church on fire

If you're unhappy 
 If you want to leave 
 I won't interfere 
 But if you miss me 
 If I'm what you need 
 I will be right here 
 Waiting for you 
 And you cut so deep 
 Scars like trophies 
 To mark each dying dream 
 And this town kills me 
 And it's swallowing 
 And closing in on me 
 Completely buried 
 And you say you don't know how to feel 
 You're so dead inside 
 And you say you don't know how to deal 
 So you try and hide 
 From this ugly life you created 
 You've become the type of girl you hated 
 Now everything that makes you tick 
 Is everything that makes me sick 
 But you're far too drunk to drive 
 So you climb inside 
 We are completely buried

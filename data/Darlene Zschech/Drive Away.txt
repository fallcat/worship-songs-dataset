Crying as your driving 
 As the rain falls from the sky 
 And you're thinking about leaving 
 As a tear falls from your eye 
 And no one ever has the right 
 To make you feel the way you feel tonight 
 Somehow someway 
 I will make this all ok 
 I know someday 
 We will both drive away 
 Needing and I'm bleeding 
 As my friends just turn away 
 They are lying and deceiving 
 As they never meant to stay 
 And no one has ever felt the way 
 The way I feel about you today 
 Somehow someway 
 I will make this all ok 
 I know someday 
 We will both drive away 
 And if you wanted we could leave tonight...

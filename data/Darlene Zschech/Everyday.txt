What to say, lord? It's 
 You who gave me life and I 
 Can't explain just how 
 Much you mean to me now 
 That you have saved me, lord 
 I give all that I am to you 
 That everyday I can 
 Be a light that shines your name 
 Everyday, lord, I'll 
 Learn to stand upon your word 
 And I pray that I 
 That I might come to know you more 
 That you would guide me with every single step I take, that 
 Everyday I can 
 Be your light unto the world 
 Everyday, it's you I live for 
 Everyday, I'll follow after you 
 Everyday, I'll walk with you, my lord 
 Everyday, lord, I'll 
 Learn to stand upon your word 
 And I pray that I 
 That I might come to know you more 
 That you would guide me with every single step I take, that 
 Everyday I can 
 Be your light unto the world 
 Everyday, it's you I live for 
 Everyday, I'll follow after you 
 Everyday, I'll walk with you, my lord 
 It's you I live for, everyday 
 It's you I live for, everyday 
 It's you I live for, everyday 
 It's you I live for, everyday 
 Everyday, it's you I live for 
 Everyday, I'll follow after you 
 Everyday, I'll walk with you, my lord 
 Everyday, it's you I live for 
 Everyday, I'll follow after you 
 Everyday, I'll walk with you, my lord

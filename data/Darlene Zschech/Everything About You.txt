You chased me 
 I caught you 
 So glad we found each other 
 We whispered forever 
 To share our lives together 
 To watch our dreams unfold 
 And I love everything about you 
 Everything you are 
 You'd catch a falling star 
 If I asked you 
 And I couldn't live a single day without you 
 You hold me in your arms 
 And once again, I know 
 That I'm the only one for you 
 The way you laugh, the way we dance 
 The way you hold my hand 
 The way you give, the way you kiss 
 The way you look at me 
 You make life beautiful 
 And I love everything about you 
 Everything you are 
 You'd catch a falling star 
 If I asked you 
 And I couldn't live a single day without you 
 You hold me in your arms 
 And once again, I know 
 That I'm the only one for you 
 Oh, I love the light that shines in your eyes 
 When you talk about our girls 
 And love the way you smile when they walk 
 Into a room 
 Oh, I love how you care about brokenness 
 How injustice moves your heart enough 
 To make a change 
 You give all you are 
 Everyday 
 And I love everything about you 
 Everything you are 
 You'd catch a falling star 
 If I asked you 
 And I couldn't live a single day without you 
 You hold me in your arms 
 And once again, I know 
 That I'm the only one for you 
 I love everything about you 
 You hold me in your arms 
 And once again I know 
 That I'm the only one for you 
 The only one for you 
 The love of my life 
 So glad I found you 
 Yeah...

Till I see You face to face this remains my hiding place 
 Where I listen as You gently speak to me 
 In this safety I will dwell, every season I will tell 
 Of the beauty and the glory of Your presence 
 Lord I know You're here 
 Lord I know You're here 
 As I seek You, You will find me 
 As I seek You, You will find me 
 As You draw me to yourself 
 As You draw me to yourself 
 For this peace I had the bounce in this joy, it fills my soul 
 There is nothing that compares to You my God 
 And I know You're here, yes, I know You're here 
 As I seek You, You will find me 
 As I seek You, You will find me 
 As You draw me to yourself 
 As You draw me to yourself 
 You're my friend here, Holy Spirit 
 Speak to me dear, Holy Spirit 
 Tenderness that makes me hold every breath 
 And to need You more 
 My searching heart was seeking for a place to find the home 
 And though the baddest toils I ask You in 
 You Love me in to life and more this fullness now I know 
 That I am Yours forever and You are mine 
 You are mine, You are mine, You are mine 
 Lord I know that You are here 
 In Your presence I will dwell 
 Love will hold me till I see You face to face

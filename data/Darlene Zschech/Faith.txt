I'm reaching for the prize 
 I'm giving everything 
 I give my life for this 
 It's what I live for 
 Nothing will keep me from 
 All that You have for me 
 You hold my head up high 
 I live for You 
 Greater is He that's living in me 
 Than he that is in the world 
 Faith I can move the mountain 
 I can do all things through Christ 
 I know 
 Faith standing and believing 
 I can do all things through Christ 
 Who strengthens me

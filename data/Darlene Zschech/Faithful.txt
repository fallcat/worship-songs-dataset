I've come to love You, Lord 
 I have come to bring all my praise 
 I've come to honor You 
 And to glorify Your beautiful Name 
 Your favor is surrounding me 
 Your word is lighting my way 
 You're faithful to deliver me 
 Your glorious love leads the way to salvation 
 All Heaven and Earth will worship You 
 Singing Holy is the Lord 
 A hymn of pure adoration 
 As we see Your wonderful Kingdom come 
 Your favor is surrounding me 
 Your word is lighting my way 
 You're faithful to deliver me 
 Your glorious love leads the way to salvation 
 Oh, You lead the world to salvation 
 Your favor is surrounding me 
 Your word is lighting my way 
 You're faithful to deliver to me 
 Your glorious love leads the way to salvation 
 Your favor is surrounding me 
 Your word is lighting my way 
 You're faithful to deliver to me 
 Your glorious love leads the way to salvation

You're the comforter to the lonely 
 The lifter of my head 
 I see You veiled in majesty 
 We cry glory, glory 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Lord, my heart cries out 
 Glory to the King 
 My greatest love in life 
 I hand You everything 
 Glory, glory 
 I hear the angels sing. 
 Open my ears 
 Let me hear Your voice 
 To know that sweet sound 
 Oh my soul rejoice 
 Glory, glory 
 I hear the angels sing 
 You're the Father to the fatherless 
 The answer to my dreams 
 I see you crowned in righteousness 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Comforter to the lonely 
 The lifter of my head 
 I see You veiled in majesty 
 We cry glory, glory 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Lord, my heart cries out 
 Glory to the King 
 My greatest love in life 
 I hand You everything 
 Glory, glory 
 I hear the angels sing. 
 Open my ears 
 Let me hear Your voice 
 To know that sweet sound 
 Oh my soul rejoice 
 Glory, glory 
 I hear the angels sing 
 You're the Father to the fatherless 
 The answer to my dreams 
 I see you crowned in righteousness 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Comforter to the lonely 
 The lifter of my head 
 I see You veiled in majesty 
 We cry glory, glory 
 We cry glory to the King 
 You're the Father to the fatherless 
 The answer to my dreams 
 I see you crowned in righteousness 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Comforter to the lonely 
 The lifter of my head 
 I see You veiled in majesty 
 We cry glory, glory 
 We cry glory to the King 
 We cry glory glory 
 We cry glory to the King

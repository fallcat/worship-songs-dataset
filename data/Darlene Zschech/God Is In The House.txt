As for me, God came and found me 
 As for me, He took me home 
 As for me, He gave me a family 
 And I'll never walk alone in my life 
 I'm soaked in blessing 
 And in Heaven there's a great reward 
 As for me and my house 
 We're gonna serve the Lord 
 I've got Jesus, Jesus 
 He calls me for His own 
 And He lifts me, lifts me 
 Above the world I know 
 God is in the house 
 There is no doubt 
 God is in the house 
 Can't keep Him out 
 As for you, as for me 
 (As for you, as for me) 
 We're gonna serve the Lord

Praise Him you heaven 
 And all that's above 
 Praise Him you angels 
 And heavenly host 
 Let the whole earth 
 Praise Him 
 Praise Him the sun, 
 Moon and bright shining stars 
 Praise Him you heaven 
 And waters and skies 
 Let the whole earth 
 Praise Him 
 Great in Power 
 Great in Glory 
 Great in Mercy 
 King of Heaven 
 Great in Battle 
 Great in Wonder 
 Great in Zion 
 King over all the earth

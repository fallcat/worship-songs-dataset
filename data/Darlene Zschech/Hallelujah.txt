You are forever in my life 
 You see me through the seasons 
 Cover me with Your hands 
 And lead me in your righteousness 
 And I look to You and 
 And I wait on You 
 I'll sing to You Lord a hymn of love 
 For Your faithfulness to me 
 And I'm carried in everlasting arms 
 You'll never let me go through it all 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah

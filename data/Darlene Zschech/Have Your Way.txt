The yearning deep within me 
 Reaches out to You 
 Your oil of joy for mourning 
 Soaks me, makes me new 
 And I will go to Your secret place 
 Bow my knee to Your glorious throne 
 Have Your way in my heart, O Lord 
 Have Your way 
 I need You, Holy Spirit 
 Fire to my soul 
 Consume my total being 
 Jesus, take control

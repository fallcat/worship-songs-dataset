Rags to riches, so they say 
 She got her break and she found her way 
 I admit this may sound strange 
 This girl is dancing a different way 
 If they only knew how You've mended 
 My broken wings, now I'm flying 
 Your love is Heaven on Earth 
 I'll shout it out to all of the world 
 There's no doubt my greatest dream has come true 
 Just to be loved by You 
 Whom You set free is free indeed 
 I've got the strength of my God in me 
 Well, You restored my dignity 
 Oh, completely, You love me 
 If they only knew how You've mended 
 My broken wings, now I'm flying 
 Your love is Heaven on Earth 
 I'll shout it out to all of the world 
 There's no doubt my greatest dream has come true 
 Just to be loved by You 
 I'm in Heaven, Heaven on earth 
 Promise to promise, this must be Heaven on earth 
 Glory to Glory, this must be Heaven 
 Heaven on Earth 
 Well, if they only knew how You mended 
 My broken heart, now I'm living 
 Your love is Heaven on Earth 
 I'll shout it out to all of the world 
 There's no doubt my greatest dream has come true 
 Just to be loved by You

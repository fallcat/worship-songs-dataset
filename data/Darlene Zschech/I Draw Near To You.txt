I draw near to You 
 You draw near to me 
 You're calling me on 
 To a higher place 
 As children run 
 To their father's voice 
 Give me open ears 
 To hear You call 
 That I may live by Your word 
 To be all I'm called to be 
 I call on Your name 
 I need You, my God 
 That I may live for Your word 
 Wholly devoted to You 
 I call on Your name 
 I need You my God 
 I draw near to You 
 You'll draw near to me 
 Let me hear You speak 
 To me Lord

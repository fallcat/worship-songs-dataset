I know it, I know it 
 His blood has set me free 
 I've been delivered, forgiven 
 Fear has got no hold on me 
 I'm set apart 
 Not livin' life my own way 
 No holding back 
 Till I see Him face to face 
 Because I know it 
 Oh yes, I know it 
 I know it 
 The blood of Jesus has set me free! 
 There is healing 
 In the name of Jesus 
 Salvation 
 In the name of Jesus 
 Forgiveness 
 In the name of Jesus 
 I've never known it 
 Like I know it today 
 There is power 
 In the name of Jesus 
 Fullness of joy 
 I've found in Jesus 
 Strength in the name of Jesus 
 I know it, I know it 
 Oh, I've got to tell you that

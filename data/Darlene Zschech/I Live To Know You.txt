Standing in Your presence 
 Lord my heart and life are changed 
 Just to love You and to live to see 
 Your beauty and Your grace 
 Heaven and Earth cry out Your name 
 Nations rise up and see Your face 
 And Your Kingdom is established 
 As I live to know You more 
 Now I will never be the same 
 Spirit of God, my life You've changed 
 And I'll forever sing Your praise 
 I live to know You Lord, I live to know You Lord 
 You've called me 
 I will follow Your will, for me I'm sure 
 Let Your heartbeat be my heart's cry 
 Let me live to serve Your call

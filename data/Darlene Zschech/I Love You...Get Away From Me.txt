I think it's a joke 
 The way that you apologize 
 And it hurts 
 Knowing you can lie while looking in my eyes 
 And you laugh 
 But this is no joke this is my life 
 And you cry 
 But tears won't make this all right 
 And when we lay together 
 And I ask you what you're thinking 
 You will tell me "nothing really" 
 I know your "nothing really" 
 Has a face and a name 
 And here I thought that we were both the same 
 Oh no 
 So yeah maybe I'm afraid of me 
 And what I'll say instinctively 
 When I'm with you don't know what to do 
 I'm grounded by your platitude 
 And what I need is some room to breath 
 Away from all this apathy 
 So write this down in your diary: 
 He said " I love you... get away from me" 
 I think it's a joke 
 The way you say you understand 
 Cause you don't 
 There's no way for you to comprehend 
 And when we lay together 
 And you ask me what I'm thinking 
 I will tell you "nothing really" 
 Know my "nothing really" 
 Has a face and a name 
 Know that I have learned to play your game 
 Oh no 
 So yeah maybe I'm afraid of me 
 And what I'll say instinctively 
 When I'm with you don't know what to do 
 I'm grounded by your platitude 
 And what I need is some room to breath 
 Away from all this apathy 
 So write this down in your diary 
 He said "I love you... get away from me" 
 Sometimes when we lay together...

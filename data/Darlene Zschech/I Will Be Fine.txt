I will be fine 
 I will not miss her 
 I'll just spend the night 
 In my bed with some scissors 
 They'll snip where she slept 
 And they'll cut where she kissed 
 They'll carve the word "nothing" 
 While I am not missed 
 And I will be fine 
 I will be fine 
 I will not cry 
 I won't stay up 
 Late at night wondering why 
 I will not focus 
 On details I miss 
 How she never once 
 Closes her eyes when we kiss 
 And I will be fine 
 I will lie here 
 With each sharpened memory 
 Shears you can not take from me 
 With mere lies and treachery 
 And we'll remember 
 Every broken promise made 
 With each crimson line we lay 
 With such perfect symmetry 
 I am not a hollow shell... 
 I will be fine 
 I am not empty 
 I'll just walk around 
 Like a ghost in this city 
 I'll smile when we meet 
 And I'll say polite hi 
 And I'll never once tell her 
 How I want to die 
 'Cause I will be fine 
 I will lie here 
 With each sharpened memory 
 Shears you can not take from me 
 With mere lies and treachery 
 And we'll remember 
 Every broken promise made 
 With each crimson line we lay 
 With such perfect symmetry

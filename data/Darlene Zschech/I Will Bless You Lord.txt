I trust in You, my faithful Lord 
 How perfect is Your love 
 You answer me before I call 
 My hope, my strength, my song 
 And I shout for joy, I thank You, Lord 
 Your plan stands firm forever 
 And Your praise will be continually 
 Pouring from my heart 
 I will bless You Lord, I will bless You Lord 
 How my soul cries out for You my God 
 I will bless You Lord

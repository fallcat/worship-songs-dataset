I will never be the same again, 
 I can never return, I've closed the door. 
 I will walk apart, I'll run the race 
 And I will never be the same again. 
 I will never be the same again, 
 I can never return, I've closed the door. 
 I will walk apart, I'll run the race 
 And I will never be the same again. 
 Fall like fire, soak like rain, 
 Flow like mighty waters, again and again. 
 Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff, 
 And let a flame burn to glorify Your name. 
 There are higher heights, there are deeper seas, 
 Whatever you need to do, Lord do in me. 
 The Glory of God fills my life, 
 And I will never be the same again. 
 Fall like fire, soak like rain, 
 Flow like mighty waters, again and again. 
 Sweep aways the darkness, burn away the chaff 
 And let a flame burn to glorify Your name. 
 Fall like fire, soak like rain, 
 Flow like mighty waters, again and again. 
 Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff, 
 And let a flame burn to glorify Your name. 
 I will never be the same again, 
 I can never return, I've closed the door. 
 I will walk the path, I will run the race 
 And I will never be the same again. 
 And I will never be the same again. 
 And I will never be the same again

God is fighting for us 
 God is on our side 
 He has overcome 
 Yes He has overcome 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be moved 
 Jesus You are here 
 Carrying our burdens 
 Covering our shame 
 He has overcome 
 Yes He has overcome 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be moved 
 Jesus You are here 
 I will live, I will not die 
 The resurrection power of Christ 
 Alive in me and I am free 
 In Jesus' Name 
 Carrying our burdens 
 Covering our shame 
 He has overcome 
 Yes He has overcome 
 We will not be shaken 
 We will not be moved 
 Jesus You are here 
 I will live, I will not die 
 The resurrection power of Christ 
 Alive in me and I am free 
 In Jesus' Name 
 I will live, I will not die 
 I will declare and lift You high 
 Christ revealed and I am healed 
 In Jesus' Name 
 God is fighting for us 
 Pushing back the darkness 
 Lighting up the Kingdom 
 That cannot be shaken 
 In the Name of Jesus 
 Enemy's defeated 
 And we will shout it out 
 Shout it out 
 I will live, I will not die 
 The resurrection power of Christ 
 Alive in me and I am free 
 In Jesus' Name 
 I will live, I will not die 
 I will declare and lift You high 
 Christ revealed and I am healed 
 In Jesus' Name, in Jesus' Name 
 In Jesus' Name, in Jesus' Name

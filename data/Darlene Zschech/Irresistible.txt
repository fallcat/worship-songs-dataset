I behold your power and glory 
 Bring an offering, Come before You 
 Worship You Lord 
 In the beauty of Your holiness 
 Whenever I call You're there 
 Redeemer and friend 
 Cherished beyond all words 
 This love never ends 
 Morning by morning, Your mercy awakens my soul 
 I lift up my eyes to see 
 The wonders of heaven Opening over me 
 Your goodness abounds 
 You've taken my breath away, with Your irresistible love

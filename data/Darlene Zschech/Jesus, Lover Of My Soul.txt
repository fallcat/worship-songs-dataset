Jesus, lover of my soul 
 Jesus, I will never let You go 
 You've taken me from the miry clay 
 You've set my feet upon the rock 
 And now I know 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I need you 
 I need you 
 Though my world may fall 
 Though my world may fall 
 I'll never let You go 
 My Savior, 
 My Savior, 
 My closest Friend 
 I will worship You 
 I will worship You until the very end 
 Sing it, Jesus 
 Jesus, You're lover of my soul 
 Sweet Jesus 
 Jesus, I will never let You go 
 And You've taken me 
 You've taken me from the miry clay 
 You've set my feet upon the rock 
 And now I know 
 I love You 
 I love You 
 And I need You 
 I need you 
 Though my world may fall 
 Though my world may fall 
 I'll never let You go 
 No, no

Jesus You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 Now I give my life to You alone 
 You are all I need 
 Jesus You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 Lord You gave Yourself 
 So I could live 
 You are all I need 
 Oh you purchased my salvation 
 And wiped away my tears 
 Now I drink Your living water 
 And I'll never thirst again 
 For You alone are Holy 
 I'll worship at Your throne 
 And You will reign forever 
 Holy is the Lord

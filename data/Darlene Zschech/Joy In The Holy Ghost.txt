I've found a friend, O, such a friend 
 He made my heart His home 
 God Himself is with me 
 And I know I'm never alone 
 I know all my tomorrows 
 Will be better than all my hopes 
 We've got love, grace, peace and power 
 And joy in the Holy Ghost 
 (We've got love) 
 My God is never wrong 
 And He makes time for me 
 (We've got grace) 
 It blew apart my chains 
 And set this sinner free 
 (We've got peace) 
 It's like a river 
 And you'll never run it dry 
 We've got power over fear and death 
 And hearts filled up with joy 
 The Holy Spirit fills me up 
 And I need Him every day 
 For fire, faith and confidence 
 And knowing what to say 
 I gave my heart and all I am 
 To the one who loves me most 
 We've got love, grace, peace and power 
 And joy in the Holy Ghost

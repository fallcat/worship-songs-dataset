We Your children pray, Lord 
 Humbly seek Your face 
 We turn from our sin, Lord 
 You hear us as we pray 
 Healing King of nations 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Purify Your church, Lord 
 Your glory over us 
 Heal us, forgive us 
 Restore our hearts again 
 Fill us, breathe upon us 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Healer of nations, hope of salvation 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 King of our hearts, King of the broken 
 Lover of the wounded 
 Defender of the weak 
 Friend of the forgotten 
 You wipe away our tears 
 Heal us, forgive us 
 Restore our hearts again 
 Fill us, breathe upon us 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Healer of nations, hope of salvation 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 King of our hearts, King of the broken 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Healer of nations, hope of salvation 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 King of my hearts, the King of the broken 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Healer of nations, hope of the world 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 King of our hearts, hope of the world 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Healer of nations, King of the broken 
 King of the broken 
 Pick me up, pick me up 
 Lifting, You're lifting me 
 You gather, You gather us all 
 Your tears are falling down 
 Your tears are falling down 
 Your tears are falling down 
 Your tears are falling down

I'm walking a new walk 
 I'll never be the same again 
 Dancing a new dance 
 In Your Holy Spirit rain 
 Your breath of life has overwhelmed me 
 And set my spirit free 
 I'm living a new life 
 Underneath Your morning star 
 Running a new race 
 In the shadow of Your Love 
 Your love is immeasurable 
 Too deep to comprehend 
 My Jesus, dream maker 
 My Jesus, life giver 
 I'm living under the kiss of heaven 
 And I'll never, ever be the same again 
 I'm singing a new song 
 In the presence of the King 
 Giving You my heart 
 That is all that I can bring 
 You lit a fire inside of me 
 That I thought would never burn again 
 My Jesus, dream maker 
 My Jesus, life giver 
 I'm living under the kiss of heaven 
 And I'll never, ever be the same again 
 My Jesus, I surrender 
 My Jesus, Yours forever 
 I'm living in the embrace of heaven 
 And I'll never ever be the same again 
 And I'll never ever be the same again 
 I thank You, my Father 
 For all You've done and all You're are going to do 
 My past behind me and You before me 
 I press on for more 
 I'm living under the kiss of heaven 
 And I'll never, never be the same again 
 My Jesus, dream maker 
 My Jesus, life giver 
 I'm living under the kiss of heaven 
 And I'll never, ever be the same again 
 My Jesus, I surrender 
 My Jesus, Yours forever 
 I'm living in the embrace of heaven 
 And I'll never ever be the same again 
 Living under the kiss of heaven

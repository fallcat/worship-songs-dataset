I heard that you like him 
 In fact that you are smitten 
 I heard that he has tattoos 
 I heard that his band's real cool 
 And I cannot believe 
 This is happening to me 
 I thought we'd be forever 
 And I'd learn to be happy 
 I heard that you kissed him 
 On a lonely wooden bench 
 Behind a cemetery 
 Where my martyrs laid to waist 
 And I cannot believe 
 This is happening to me 
 I thought we'd be forever 
 And I'd learn to be happy 
 Bleeding for Hollywood 
 Maybe if you suffer long enough 
 Someone will publicize this tragedy

I wanna make you sad 
 I wanna make you cry 
 I wanna make you feel the way 
 I feel inside 
 And I won't ever be alright 
 No I won't ever be alright 
 I wanna loose your face 
 To forget your name 
 Would be the change I need 
 So I can face the day again 
 But I won't ever be alright 
 No I won't ever be alright 
 You heard the anxiousness and urgency 
 If my voice on the phone 
 And the little voice inside your head 
 Said "he shouldn't be alone" 
 So picked me up and you held me up 
 And said "when's this gonna end?" 
 When you're not with him 
 And I won't ever be alright 
 No I won't ever be alright

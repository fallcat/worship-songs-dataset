Lord I give myself, I trust in You mighty God 
 My Saviour and Your mercy and love 
 Overflows and my soul rejoices 
 Lord show me Your ways, guide my steps 
 Lead me to Your righteousness 
 And the light of Your love takes my fear away 
 'Cause I know You walk before me, yes 
 Oh my Shepherd, You let me rest in Your arms 
 You comfort me and everywhere that I go 
 I'm not alone mighty God, I know You're with me 
 And everywhere that I go I'm not alone mighty God 
 I know You're with me

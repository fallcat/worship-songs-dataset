Lord of all, all of creation 
 Sings Your praise in Heaven and earth 
 Lord we stand, hearts open wide, be exalted 
 Lord, I long to see 
 You glorified in ev'rything I do 
 All my heartfelt dreams 
 I put aside to see Your Spirit 
 Move with power in my life 
 Jesus, Lord of all eternity 
 Your children rise in faith 
 All earth displays Your glory 
 And each word You speak 
 Brings life to all who hear

I will come to You 
 With an open heart, 
 And bring a sacrifice of praise. 
 I have seen Your power 
 In the Holy place. 
 And I have known Your mighty ways. 
 I will remember Your mercy 
 And, Lord, Your faithfulness. 
 Lord, Your goodness 
 And Your love will follow me 
 All the days of my life. 
 I'm surrounded in the favor 
 Of the Lord, Always and Forever

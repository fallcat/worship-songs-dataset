I will bless the Lord forever 
 And I will trust Him at all times 
 He has delivered me from all fear 
 And he has set my feet upon a rock 
 And I will not be moved 
 And I'll say of the Lord... 
 You are my shield 
 My strength 
 My portion 
 Deliverer 
 My shelter 
 Strong tower 
 My very present help in time of need 
 Whom have I in Heaven but you? 
 There's none I desire beside you 
 You have made me glad 
 And I'll say of the Lord... 
 You are my shield 
 My strength 
 My portion 
 Deliverer 
 My shelter 
 Strong tower 
 My very present help in time of need 
 You are my shield 
 My strength 
 My portion 
 Deliverer 
 My shelter 
 Strong tower 
 My very present help in time of need 
 You have me glad 
 And I'll say of the Lord... 
 You are my shield 
 My strength 
 My portion 
 Deliverer 
 My shelter 
 Strong tower 
 My very present help in time of need 
 You are my shield 
 My strength 
 My portion 
 Deliverer 
 My shelter 
 Strong tower 
 My very present help in time of need 
 My very present help in time of need

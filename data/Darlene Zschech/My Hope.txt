You are righteous 
 Your love justice 
 And those who honour You 
 Will see Your face 
 I will arise and lift my eyes 
 To see Your majesty 
 Your holiness, 
 And all I am will bless You 
 My hope is in the Name of the Lord 
 Where my help comes from 
 You're my strength, my song 
 My trust in the Name of the Lord 
 I will sing Your praise, 
 You are faithful.

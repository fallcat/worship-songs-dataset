My Jesus I love Thee, I know Thou art mine 
 For Thee all the follies of sin I resign 
 My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou 
 If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now 
 I love Thee because Thou has first loved me 
 And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree 
 I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow 
 If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now 
 I'll love Thee in life and I will love Thee in death 
 And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath 
 And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow 
 If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now 
 I love You Jesus 
 I'll always love You 
 Now and forever 
 I belong to You 
 In mansions of glory and endless delight 
 I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright 
 I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow 
 If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now 
 I love You Jesus 
 I'll always love You 
 Now and forever 
 I belong to You 
 I love You Jesus 
 I'll always love You 
 Now and forever 
 I belong to You 
 I belong to You 
 I belong to You 
 Lift Jesus higher

 Lift Jesus higher 
 Lift Jesus higher 
 Lift Jesus higher 
 Lift Jesus higher 
 Lift Jesus higher

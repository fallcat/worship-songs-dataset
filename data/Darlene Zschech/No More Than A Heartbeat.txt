Carry my world 
 In Your nail-scarred hands, 
 Breathing Your hope 
 And Your life in me. 
 No more than a heartbeat away, 
 No more than a heartbeat away. 
 Whereever I go, 
 I know that You're there, 
 No more than a heartbeat away. 
 Closer than my dreams, 
 Lord, I know You. 
 You're near me, 
 You're near me. 
 Your everlasting arms, 
 They surround me. 
 You hold me, 
 You hold me. 
 Every word I pray, 
 Lord, You listen, 
 My Savior, You heard me, 
 Watching over me 
 Every moment. 
 You keep me, 
 You keep me. 
 You'll never leave me 
 Without You. 
 You'll never leave me alone.You'll never leave me 
 Without You, 
 "'Cause I know 
 You'll always be there.

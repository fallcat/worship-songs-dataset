Jesus gave the power 
 To be all you were meant to be 
 And people get free 
 The Word of God is planted 
 And living in my heart 
 I'm an overcomer 
 I live His promise out 
 This was not a new thing 
 Until it happened to me 
 Now I walk in power 
 I walk in victory 
 You lose your fears 
 When you stand in faith 
 You lose your tears 
 When you trust His grace 
 You lose your pain 
 When you know His touch 
 Only Christ can turn 
 Your bitter into sweet 
 And people get free

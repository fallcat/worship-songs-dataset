We're gonna praise His holy name 
 We're gonna praise His holy name 
 Lift Him up, above the heavens 
 Praise His holy name 
 Lord I want to thank You for everything You've done 
 Way beyond my wildest hopes and dreams 
 Gonna lift my hands and sing out loud 
 And praise His wonderful name 
 Hallelujah 
 (Hallelujah) 
 Glory to Almighty God 
 (Glory to Almighty God) 
 Hallelujah 
 (Hallelujah) 
 Glory to Almighty God 
 (Glory to Almighty God)

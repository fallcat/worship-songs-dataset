Laid down mystery 
 Of life quite clear to me 
 The sparkling truth revealed 
 Soul satisfying 
 This treasure of life to bring 
 It gives me this passion to sing 
 I need You, I run 
 Into Your arms 
 Above the world 
 Oh, I'll go to You 
 A light in the darkness 
 You're shining Your heart in me 
 I promise, I promise 
 To eternity I live and die 
 To know You, to love You 
 For I found what I've been looking for 
 Well, I sense You more all along 
 This need in me to belong 
 Your winds of grace complete me 
 Spread me away 
 But Your love is peaceable, I know 
 Just look at me, does it show? 
 I long for the day 
 That I see You face to face 
 Above the world 
 Oh, I'll go to You 
 A light in the darkness 
 You're shining Your heart in me 
 I promise, I promise 
 To eternity I live and die 
 To know You, to love You 
 For I found what I've been looking for 
 I promise, I promise, yeah, yeah 
 Desire of all nations 
 We come 
 Strength of my life 
 You are shining Your heart in me 
 I promise, I promise 
 To eternity I live and I'm dying 
 To know You, to love You 
 For I found what I've been looking for 
 I promise, I promise 
 To eternity I live, I will die 
 To know You, to love You 
 For I found what I've been looking for

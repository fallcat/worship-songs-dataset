The dawning, sun rising 
 Our great God is here 
 Creation is singing 
 The song of the free 
 Calling the broken 
 The morning is here 
 Awaken with healing 
 It's love 
 Hear the sound of salvation 
 Love is saving me 
 Everything I am becoming free to love 
 You're saving me, Your love saving me 
 This beauty for ashes 
 Your love changing me 
 Your presence is calling me 
 Oh hear the sound of salvation 
 Love is saving me 
 Everything I am becoming free 
 To love you're saving me 
 Your love saving me 
 Love is saving me 
 You gave it up for all humanity 
 Your love is saving me 
 Your love saving me 
 Oh, hear the sound, all around 
 Calling every nation 
 Oh hear the sound of salvation

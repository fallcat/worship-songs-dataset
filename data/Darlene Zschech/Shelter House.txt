Into the shelter house I go 
 Where the Spirit of God will flow 
 And I rest in the presence of the Lord 
 I take it everywhere I go 
 And I let everybody know 
 That deep within me 
 Dwells the power of God 
 In the shelter house of my heart 
 Oh Lord, You have blessed me you have filled me up 
 Given me life and the hope to carry on 
 I thank God that when I'm weak, I can call Your name 
 And walk boldly in the presence of the King 
 I am filled with the power and authority 
 To take on any opposition that may rise 
 I don't care about the circumstance, I may be in 
 'Cause I know, this power within me never ends

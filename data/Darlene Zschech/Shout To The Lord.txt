My Jesus, my Savior 
 Lord, there is none like You 
 All of my days, I want to praise 
 The wonders of Your mighty love 
 My comfort, my shelter 
 Tower of refuge and strength 
 Let every breath, all that I am 
 Never cease to worship You 
 Shout to the Lord 
 All the earth let us sing 
 Power and majesty praise to the King 
 (Mountains bow down) 
 Mountains bow down 
 And the seas will roar 
 At the sound of Your name 
 I sing for joy at the work of Your hands 
 Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand 
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You

Holy one 
 I come again 
 And run into the shelter of your wing 
 On my knees 
 Before you now 
 You gently lift the burden of my heart 
 And you sing over me 
 Yes you sing over me 
 The wonder of 
 The mystery of 
 Your unfailing love, forever 
 How wonderful 
 How beautiful 
 Your amazing love, forever 
 Breathe on me, holy one 
 I linger in the presence of your love 
 Heavens song, sung to me 
 Lifts me up again to bring you praise 
 And you sing over me 
 Yes you sing over me 
 Heavens song, surrounding me 
 Yes you sing over me

Come to the Father, though your gift is small 
 Broken hearts, broken lives, He will take them all 
 The power of the word, the power of His blood 
 Everything was done so you would come 
 Before the world began, you were on His mind 
 And every tear you cry is precious in His eyes 
 Because of His great love, He gave His only son 
 Everything was done so you would come 
 Nothing you can do could make Him love you more 
 And nothing that you've done could make Him close the door 
 Because of His great love, He gave His only son 
 Everything was done so you would come 
 The power of the word, the power of His blood 
 Everything was done so you would come

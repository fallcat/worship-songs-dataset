I wanted something better than this 
 There's something missing in you eyes 
 The light's been gone from them 
 For days and nights are lonely 
 When you go away 
 There's something missing in your smile 
 Is there something you want to 
 Say to me but you're 
 Afraid to say 
 And I know that you know 
 What it's like to be alone 
 And you know, I know 
 What it's like feeling alone 
 I don't know and I'm not sure 
 If sorry is good enough anymore 
 I don't know and I'm not sure 
 If sorry even matters 
 There's something missing in my life 
 Is there something I should take 
 If taking something 
 Takes this pain away 
 There's something missing in my life 
 Is there something I should say 
 If saying something 
 Makes you say you'll stay 
 And I know that you know 
 What it's like to feel alone 
 You know, I know 
 What it's like being alone 
 I don't know, I'm not sure 
 If sorry is good enough any more 
 I don't know and I'm not sure 
 If sorry even matters 
 'Cause I wanted something better than this

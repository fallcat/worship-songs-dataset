I felt your gentle rain 
 You wash over my heart again 
 And I find You here 
 I Find You here 
 You take me by the hand 
 And when I don't understand 
 You hold me 
 You hold me 
 To the cross I come again 
 I'm so thankful, I'm thankful 
 You're mercy over me again 
 I'm so thankful, living God 
 I wanna thank You living God 
 In the light of day 
 You're truth defies my way 
 And You call me Yours 
 I'm forever Yours 
 For eternity, 
 You will be, You will be 
 Yesterday, today and forever, 
 You remain the same 
 To the cross I come again 
 I'm so thankful, I'm thankful 
 You're mercy over me again 
 I'm so thankful, living God 
 To the cross I come again 
 I'm so thankful, I'm thankful 
 You're mercy over me again 
 I'm so thankful, living God 
 I wanna thank You living God

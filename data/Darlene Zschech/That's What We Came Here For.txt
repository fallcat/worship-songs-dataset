We come into Your presence with singing 
 We come into Your presence with praise 
 Enter Your gates with thankful hearts 
 We are gonna celebrate 
 All of Heaven's waiting 
 Power's on its way 
 So we shout 'Hallelujah' 
 Lift it to You 
 A mighty roar of praise 
 You deserve the highest praise 
 We can give and more 
 Lord, we give our praise 
 That's what we came here for 
 (You deserve the highest praise, 
 You deserve the highest praise, 
 You deserve the highest praise...)

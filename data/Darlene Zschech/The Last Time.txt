My words are clumsy cliche' and trite 
 I could never turn a phrase just right 
 To find a better way to say I miss you 
 So I'll just say I miss you 
 I can't let it go it means too much to me 
 I won't let it go it means too much to me 
 I'll concentrate on distances from heartlands to the shore 
 For each mile that separates our lives there's a million miles more 
 I can't let it go it means too much to me 
 I won't let you go you mean to much to me 
 I'll concentrate on differences what you want and who I am 
 For each nine to five you survive I will never understand 
 I can't let it go it means too much to me 
 I won't let you go you mean to much to me 
 And this is the last time I speak your name 
 The last time that I play this game 
 And this is the last time that I'll say 
 I'm sorry if I hurt you

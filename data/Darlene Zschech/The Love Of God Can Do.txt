Love flies higher, walks through fire 
 Doesn't change from day to day 
 If it's really love, it just won't give up 
 Love will never pass away 
 He can make a way where there isn't a way 
 That's what the love of God can do 
 Everything can start new every day 
 That's what the love of God can do 
 The whole world changed when love stepped in 
 That's what the love of God can do 
 Hearts to save and a world to win 
 That's what the love of God can do 
 Love is patient, love is kind 
 If someone else wins love doesn't mind 
 Love believes, love forgives 
 And God is the start of all of this

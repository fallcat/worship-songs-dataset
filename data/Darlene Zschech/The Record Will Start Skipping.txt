It's an awkward first encounter 
 We need a minute to shake off the rust 
 And it feels so good to see you again 
 But it's clear that there is no us 
 And I can't fight this feeling 
 That this is either the beginning 
 Of something beautiful 
 Or the winding down of a tragedy 
 And I'm not reeling 
 I'm just slowly sinking 
 Into somber feelings 
 And searching for some clarity 
 Are you listening? 
 'Cause I am listening hard 
 To the sound of you sleep 
 Trying hard to count 
 The subtulties of the reasons 
 You mean so much to me 
 And I can't fight this feeling 
 If I let the needle drop 
 The record will just start skipping 
 'Cause I have this sinking suspision 
 We've been here once before 
 And I don't mind revealing 
 Cause the secrets loose their meaning 
 On the hundreth time 
 I've sang the line 
 'Cause you've heard it all before 
 It's an awkward first encounter 
 We need a minute to shake off the rust

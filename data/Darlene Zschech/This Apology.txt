 It's not alright and it's not ok. 
 It's not enough that we feel the same. 
 I will write this apology. 
 Line after line I will rhyme this apology.

 But a love like this is likely to level me. 
 Dear Love, I like this love. 
 But a love like this is likely to level me. 
 I will write this apology. 
 Line after line I will rhyme this apology. 
 Time after time I will find it's so hard to say I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

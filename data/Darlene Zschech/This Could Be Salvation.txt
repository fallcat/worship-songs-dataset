This city is slowly dying 
 As she tiptoes her way through the storm 
 Soaked and shuddering and so alone 
 And I don't want to let her down 
 But I am not programmed to last 
 I'm no pilot and this ship was built to crash 
 The world is waiting for you 
 Only you don't know what you're waiting for 
 Until you watch outside your window and you walk outside your door 
 And she is there beside you all along 
 Her ghost is there to guide you and keep you strong 
 And keep you strong so hold on 
 This could be salvation 
 She says "so ready the rain, to drown all our dreams 
 It's the little victories and tiny defeats" 
 So let's drown all our dreams 
 It's the little victories and tiny defeats 
 The world is waiting for you 
 Only you don't know what you're waiting for 
 Until you watch outside that window 
 And you walk outside that door 
 And I am not your savior 
 I'm not what you've been waiting for 
 But this could be salvation

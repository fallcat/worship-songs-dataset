This is not a song 
 This is not a melody 
 This is just another attempt at a sincere apology 
 This is not a song 
 This is not me singing 
 This is just an open letter this is me apologizing 
 And this is not a song 
 These are not lyrics 
 This is just another way to chase away these spirits 
 And this is not a song 
 These are not my words 
 This is simply me saying sorry to a girl

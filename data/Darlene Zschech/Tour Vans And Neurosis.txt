With another foot closer 
 To the preverbial ledge 
 With another broken heart 
 And busted edge 
 With another empty promise 
 That I know I can't keep 
 And another fading night 
 Because I know I can't sleep 
 With everything you are 
 And everything I'm not 
 With everything I've lost 
 And all these vices I've got 
 With every waking second 
 Of every fucking day 
 With all these haunting voices 
 That I wish would go away 
 And I am praying for rain 
 To fall down on me 
 And wash off the pain 
 That I've grown to need 
 I am praying for rain 
 To fall down on me 
 They say it's cleansing 
 And I believe 
 They say regret looks back 
 Confusion looks around 
 They say faith looks to the sky 
 So I focus on the ground 
 'Cause I'm stepping on the cracks 
 Practicing what I can say 
 Just to try to make it better 
 Or just make it ok 
 And I am praying for rain 
 To fall down on me 
 And wash off the pain 
 That I've grown to need 
 I am praying for rain 
 To fall down on me 
 They say it's cleansing 
 And you ask 
 "Are you mad at me?" 
 And I confirm 
 You don't even bother asking why 
 You're unconcerned 
 From kicking you out 
 To kissing in the rain 
 This life is like a bad romance movie 
 So goodbye to old lovers 
 Goodbye to this town 
 Goodbye to my friends 
 Who feel they once knew me well 
 'Cause I got me some songs 
 And I got me a band 
 And I got me a day job 
 To buy me a van 
 And I'm leaving this town 
 And you people I hate 
 And I'll smile to myself 
 As we hit the next state 
 And I am praying for rain 
 To fall down on me 
 And wash off the pain 
 That I've grown to need 
 Someone turn down the sun 
 Bring me some night 
 I can't stand the way 
 I look in this daylight 
 I am praying for rain 
 To fall down on me 
 And wash off the pain 
 That I've grown to need 
 I am praying for rain 
 To fall down on me 
 They say it's cleansing 
 And I believe 
 They say that miracles never cease 
 Well I am totally alone 
 They say the history just repeats and repeats 
 I am once again on my own

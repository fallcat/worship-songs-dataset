Under grace, you cover my failing again 
 Heavenly rain you wash all my fear away 
 When I woke today, the sun was not hiding away 
 And hope filled my world once again 
 My life forever, changed by the Master 
 My life forever, given to praise 
 And I'm forever grateful for my salvation 
 Washing over all my sin You are washing over all my sin 
 Beautiful mercy reaching to rescue my soul 
 Whole at the cross, where Love came to cover it all, once and for all 
 As evening parades, the setting sun calls me to praise 
 And You fill my world once again 
 Rain, rain, come again I pray 
 Rain, rain, come again heaven's rain 
 Washing over all my sin 
 Rain, rain, come again I pray 
 Rain, rain, come again heaven's rain 
 Rain, rain come again, 
 Washing over all my sin 
 These aren't the tears of sadness or pain 
 These are the tears of one who knows grace 
 Washing over all my sin

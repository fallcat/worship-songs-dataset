You are always fighting for us 
 Heaven's angels all around 
 My delight is found in knowing 
 That You wear the Victor's crown 
 You're my help and my defender 
 You're my Savior and my friend 
 By Your grace I live and breathe 
 To worship You 
 At the mention of Your greatness 
 In Your Name I will bow down 
 In Your presence fear is silent 
 For You wear the Victor's crown 
 Let Your glory fill this temple 
 Let Your power overflow 
 By Your grace I live and breathe 
 To worship You 
 Hallelujah 
 You have overcome 
 You have overcome 
 Hallelujah 
 Jesus You have overcome the world 
 You are ever interceding 
 As the lost become the found 
 You can never be defeated 
 For You wear the Victor's crown 
 You are Jesus the Messiah 
 You're the Hope of all the world 
 By Your grace I live and breathe 
 To worship You 
 Hallelujah 
 You have overcome 
 You have overcome 
 Hallelujah 
 Jesus You have overcome the world 
 Every high thing must come down 
 Every stronghold shall be broken 
 You wear the Victor's crown 
 You overcome 
 You overcome 
 (x4) 
 At the cross the work was finished 
 You were buried in the ground 
 But the grave could not contain You 
 For You wear the Victor's crown 
 Hallelujah 
 You have overcome 
 You have overcome 
 Hallelujah 
 Jesus You have overcome the world 
 Every high thing must come down 
 Every stronghold shall be broken 
 You wear the Victor's crown 
 You overcome 
 You overcome

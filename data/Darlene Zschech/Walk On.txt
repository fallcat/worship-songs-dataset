Love is not the easy thing 
 The only baggage you can bring 
 Is all that you can't leave behind 
 Love is not the easy thing 
 The only baggage you can bring 
 Is all that you can't leave behind 
 And if the darkness is to keep us apart 
 And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off 
 And if your glass heart should crack 
 And for a second you turn back 
 Oh no be strong 
 Walk on, walk on 
 What you got they can't steal it 
 No they can't even feel it 
 Walk on, walk on 
 Stay safe tonight 
 You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been 
 A place that has to be believed to be seen 
 You could have flown away 
 A singing bird in an open cage 
 Who will only fly for freedom 
 Walk on, walk on 
 What you got they can't deny it 
 No they can't even try it 
 Walk on, walk on 
 Stay safe tonight 
 And I know it aches 
 And your heart it breaks 
 You only take so much 
 Walk on, walk on 
 Home... hard to know what it is if you never had one 
 Home... I can't say where it is but I know I'm going 
 Home... that's where the heart is 
 Walk on, walk on 
 All that you fashion 
 All that you make 
 All that you build 
 All that you can break 
 All that you measure 
 All that you steal 
 All this you can leave it all behind 
 All that you reason 
 All you can sense 
 All that you speak 
 All you dress up 
 All that you scheme 
 All that you fashion 
 You can leave it all behind 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah

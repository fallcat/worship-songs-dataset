You knew me 
 Even as a child I heard 
 You call me closer 
 Clearly like a song I've always known 
 You would play for me 
 Like the breaking of the dawn 
 Everyday I long for more of You 
 Where would I be without Your love 
 Where would I be without Your hand 
 On my life 
 Lifted 
 Through the valleys 
 Through the pain 
 I know You're with me 
 Carried 
 Like I'm dancing in the rain 
 You cover me 
 Then You catch me when I fall 
 As we walk this gift of Life 
 I need You 
 Where would I be without Your love 
 Where would I be without Your hand 
 On my life 
 Forever 
 I will follow You 
 I will live for You 
 Forever 
 I will worship You 
 I will follow You 
 Forever 
 I will live for You 
 I will worship You 
 Forever 
 Will You dance with me again 
 For I can only live this life 
 With You 
 Where would I be without Your love 
 Where would I be without Your hand 
 On my life 
 Where would I be without Your grace 
 Where would I be without Your refuge 
 Over me

Thank you for the cross, Lord. 
 Thank you for the price you paid. 
 Bearing all my sin and shame, in love you came 
 And gave Amazing Grace. 
 Thank you for this love, Lord. 
 Thank you for the nail-pierced hands. 
 Wash me in Your cleansing flow, now all I know... 
 Your forgivness and embrace. 
 Worthy is the Lamb 
 Seated on the throne. 
 We crown You now with many crowns 
 You reign victorious! 
 High and lifted up 
 Jesus, Son of God. 
 The darling of Heaven, crucified... 
 Worthy is the Lamb.

<You hold the world in motion 
 You say the word and heaven opens 
 You flung the stars into space 
 God of wonders 
 You know my name 
 When the day is gone 
 And the house is still 
 My hungry soul cries out to find you 
 And you're waiting for me 
 Waiting for me 
 So many things I long to say 
 But in your presence 
 I am speechless 
 For I am loved by you 
 In a crowded world your faithfulness 
 Reaches to hold me ever thankful 
 That I am loved by you 
 There's an anthem beckoning in me to sing 
 I'll play it for you, play it for You 
 There's a song of hope 
 That I need to bring 
 I'll sing it for you, sing it for you 
 Every time I call your name I know 
 You're waiting for me, waiting for me 
 Every day and night I come and bow 
 Before your throne 
 You oceans rise to praise you 
 You paint the skies with the colours of grace 
 You hold in my life in your hands 
 God of wonders 
 You know my name

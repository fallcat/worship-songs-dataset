I'm so secure, you're here with me 
 You stay the same, your love remains here in my heart 
 So close I believe You're holding me now in your hands I belong, 
 You'll never let me go 
 You'll never let me go 
 You gave Your life in Your endless love 
 You set me free and show the way 
 Now I am found 
 So close I believe You're holding me now in your hands I belong, 
 You'll never let me go 
 You'll never let me go 
 All along, You were beside me, even when I couldn't tell, 
 Through the years, You've shown me more of You (more of You) 
 So close I believe You're holding me now in your hands I belong, 
 You'll never let me go 
 You'll never let me go

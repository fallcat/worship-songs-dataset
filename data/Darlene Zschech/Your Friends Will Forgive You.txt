I don't want to fall asleep tonight 
 Out of fear that you might not be here when the morning comes 
 I don't want to have to wake up and find 
 All the things you said to me tonight were just sweat lies 
 So live the life you fake 
 And make all your mistakes 
 The friends that you forsake will forgive you 
 For each lie that you make 
 And each heart that your break 
 Each love you gave away will remind you 
 I don't want to fall in love tonight 
 Out of fear that you won't care for me in the morning light 
 I don't want to have to wake and find 
 You've already moved on and left me far behind 
 And it's probably just the chemicals 
 But I've never felt so cynical 
 And it's probably just this social scene 
 But I've never seen such posturing 
 And I've never felt so alone in a crowded room 
 I've never felt so alone standing next to you 
 Everybody's given up on dreams 
 So they make due with the next best thing 
 So live the life you hate 
 And make all your mistakes 
 All the friends that you forsake will forgive you 
 For each like that you make 
 And each felling you fake 
 Each love you gave away will remind you 
 And you pawn it off on fate 
 'Cause it's more than you can take 
 Your touch annihalates 
 Each person that you meet 
 And at night we lay awake 
 To keep the dreams at bay 
 Our nightmares will convey 
 The secrets that we keep

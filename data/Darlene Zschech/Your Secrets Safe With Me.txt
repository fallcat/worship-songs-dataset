Well I just wanted to write and say 
 I miss you more and more everyday 
 I understand why it should be this way 
 But it hurts too bad for me to stay 
 I just needed you to know 
 I think of you everywhere I go 
 I take you with me wherever I go 
 But I really should be letting go 
 So I say we split the country 
 You head to L.A. I'll move to New York City 
 And we'll pretend we never met 
 I'll stay off Venice Beach 
 If you promise me I'll never see you down on the Bowery 
 And I swear I will forget you yet 
 I just wanted you to know 
 That you haunt me wherever I go 
 Anymore I never fell alone 
 'Cause I always travel with your ghost 
 It was something we didn't anticipate 
 I react and you retaliate 
 We weren't worried about who was right 
 We were only trying to win the fight 
 I just wanted to write and say 
 I want you more and more everyday 
 I need you more and more everyday 
 They said in time the pain would go away 
 But it grows in me everyday 
 I want more and more everyday 
 I need you more and more everyday 
 I just wanted to write and say 
 Your secrets safe with me

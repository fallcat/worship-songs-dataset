It's the song of the redeemed 
 Rising from the African plain 
 It's the song of the forgiven 
 Drowning out the Amazon rain 
 The song of Asian believers 
 Filled with God's holy fire 
 It's every tribe, every tongue, every nation 
 A love song born of a grateful choir 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns 
 Let it rise about the four winds 
 Caught up in the heavenly sound 
 Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals 
 To the faithful gathered underground 
 Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation 
 Some were meant to persist 
 Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples 
 None rings truer than this 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns 
 And all the powers of darkness 
 Tremble at what they've just heard, oh, tremble 
 'Cause all the powers of darkness 
 Can't drown out a single word, no, no way 
 When all God's children sing out 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 All God's people singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 You reign over Heaven, You reign over earth 
 You reign over me, Jesus You are my King 
 You reign over Heaven, You reign over earth 
 You reign over me, Jesus You reign long 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah, He reigns 
 And we will sing of His love forever

The splendor of the King 
 Clothed in majesty 
 Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice 
 He wraps Himself in light 
 And darkness tries to hide 
 And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice 
 How great is our God 
 Sing with me 
 How great is our God 
 And all will see 
 How great, how great 
 Is our God 
 And age to age He stands 
 And time is in His hands 
 Beginning and the End, Beginning and the End 
 The Godhead, Three in One 
 Father, Spirit, Son 
 The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb 
 How great is our God 
 Sing with me 
 How great is our God 
 And all will see 
 How great, how great 
 Is our God 
 Name above all names 
 Worthy of all praise 
 My heart will sing 
 How great is our God 
 Name above all names 
 You are worthy of all praise 
 My heart will sing how great 
 Is our God 
 How great is our God 
 Sing with me 
 How great is our God 
 And all will see 
 How great, how great 
 Is our God 
 How great is our God 
 Sing with me 
 How great is our God 
 And all will see 
 How great, how great 
 Is our God 
 How great is our God 
 Sing with me 
 How great is our God 
 And all will see 
 How great, how great 
 Is our God

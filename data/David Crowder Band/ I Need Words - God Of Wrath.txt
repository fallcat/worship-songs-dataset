I need words as wide as sky 
 I need a language large as this longing inside 
 And I need a voice bigger than mine 
 And I need a song to sing you that I've yet to find 
 I need you, oh, I need you 
 Oh, I need you, oh, I need you 
 To be here now, to be here now 
 To hear me now, to hear me now 
 God of wrath, God of love 
 God of earth and God above 
 God of hope, God of peace 
 God of you and God of me 
 God of day, God of night 
 God the just and God the light 
 God of the strong, God of the weak 
 God of you and God of me 
 My love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, oh all I am for You 
 My love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, oh all I am for You 
 God of wrath, God of love 
 God of earth and God above 
 God of hope, God of peace 
 God of you and God of me 
 God of day, God of night 
 God the just and God the light 
 God of the strong, God of the weak 
 God of you and God of me 
 All my love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, oh all I am for You 
 My love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, oh all I am for You 
 My love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, oh all I am for You 
 My love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, oh all I am for You 
 Blood through my veins for You 
 I give my world to You 
 All I am and all I have I lay it down for You 
 Dancing 'round with You 
 Spinning 'round with You 
 Laughing loud with You, my love 
 My love 
 My love for You 
 My life for You 
 My life for You 
 My love for You 
 My love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, all I am for You 
 My love for You, my heart for You 
 My life for You, all I am for You

 Always 
 You will never end 
 Because 
 You're always 
 Never ending 
 You were 
 There before 
 There was beginning 
 Always 
 You were 
 You are never ending 
 Here you are now 
 With us here 
 We are found 
 In You 
 And this makes all the difference 
 This changes everything 
 Making our whole existence 
 Worth something so we sing 
 La, la, la? 
 And You make all the difference 
 Yeah, You change everything 
 You make our whole existence 
 Worth something so we sing 
 La, la, la?

The breaking makes a sound I never knew 
 Could be so beautiful and loud, 
 Fury filled and we collide. 
 So courageous until now, fumbling and scared. 
 So afraid You'll find me out, 
 Alone here with my doubt. 
 Here it comes, a beautiful collision 
 Is happening now. 
 There seems no end to where You begin and 
 There I am now 
 You and I collide. 
 Something circling inside, 
 Spaciously you fly, infinite and wide, 
 Like the moon and sky collide. 
 Here it comes, a beautiful collision 
 Is happening now. 
 There seems no end to where You begin and 
 There I am now 
 You and I collide. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes now. 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes now. 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes now. 
 Collide. 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes now, 
 You and I. 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes now, 
 You and I. 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes now. 
 I feel it coming now 
 I feel it coming now 
 Here it comes now. 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes, 
 Here it comes now.

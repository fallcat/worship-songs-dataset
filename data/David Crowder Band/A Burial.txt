As we, the community, have gathered here, I would like to pose a question; 
 How do you sum up a life in a few words? 
 How do you measure the weight of a soul in a matter of moments? 
 You do not. 
 You cannot. 
 But you can pray for rest 
 And you can pray for light 
 And you can remember, 
 You can always remember; 
 Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis. 
 In memoria aeterna erit iustus, ab auditione mala non timebit.

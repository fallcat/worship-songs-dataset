I can't comprehend your infinitely beautiful and perfect love 
 Oh I've dreamed dreams of majesty as brilliant as a billion stars 
 But they're never bright enough after all 
 You are Holy 
 Oh Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 I will sing a song for you my God with everything I have in me 
 But it's never loud enough after all 
 You are Holy 
 Oh Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Heaven and earth are full, full of your glory, glory 
 My soul it overflows full of your glory, your glory 
 Oh blessed is he who reigns, full of your glory, your glory 
 My cup, it can't contain all of your glory, your glory 
 Hosanna we are found after all you are 
 Holy 
 Oh Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 I can't comprehend 
 You're infinitely beautiful

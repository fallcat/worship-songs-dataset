My hands are searching for You 
 My arms are outstretched towards You 
 I feel You on my fingertips 
 My tongue dances behind my lips for You 
 This fire rising through my being 
 Burning I'm not used to seeing You 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I can feel you all around me 
 Thickening the air I'm breathing 
 Holding on to what I'm feeling 
 Savoring this heart that's healing 
 My hands float up above me 
 And you whisper You love me 
 And I begin to fade 
 Into our secret place 
 The music makes me sway 
 The angels singing say we are alone with You 
 I am alone and they are too with You 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I can feel You all around me 
 Thickening the air I'm breathing 
 Holding on to what I'm feeling 
 Savoring this heart that's healing 
 And so I cry 
 The light is white 
 And I see you 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I can feel You all around me 
 Thickening the air I'm breathing 
 Holding on to what I'm feeling 
 Savoring this heart that's healing 
 Take my hand 
 I give it to you 
 Now you own me 
 All I am 
 You said You would never leave me 
 I believe you 
 I believe 
 I can feel you all around me 
 Thickening the air I'm breathing 
 Holding on to what I'm feeling 
 Savoring this heart that's healed

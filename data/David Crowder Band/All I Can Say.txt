Lord I'm tired 
 So tired from walking 
 And Lord I'm so alone 
 And Lord the dark 
 Is creeping in 
 Creeping up 
 To swallow me 
 I think I'll stop 
 Rest here a while 
 And didn't You see me cry'n? 
 And didn't You hear me call Your name? 
 Wasn't it You I gave my heart to? 
 I wish You'd remember 
 Where you sat it down 
 And this is all that I can say right now 
 And this is all that I can give 
 I didn't notice You were standing here 
 I didn't know that 
 That was You holding me 
 I didn't notice You were cry'n too 
 I didn't know that 
 That was You washing my feet

In the middle of the mess, there is majesty 
 In the middle of my chest, is the king of kings 
 While the world was waiting on 
 A change to come along 
 Light broke in 
 Coming like a song 
 All this glory 
 All this glory 
 All this glory 
 In the middle of the night, all this light 
 In the middle of the night, all this light here 
 In the middle of the night, you are majesty 
 To the middle of our plight, came the King of Kings 
 While we were waiting on, your love to come along 
 Light broke in 
 Coming like a son 
 All this glory 
 All this glory 
 All this glory 
 All this glory 
 In the middle of the night, all this light 
 In the middle of the night, all this light 
 In the middle of the night, all this light 
 In the middle of the night, after all this quiet 
 Jesus, God with us 
 Jesus Christ has come, and I'm undone 
 Jesus, God with us 
 Jesus Christ has come, and I'm undone 
 All this glory 
 All this glory 
 All this glory 
 All this glory, here 
 Jesus, God with us 
 Jesus Christ has come, and I'm undone 
 Jesus, God with us 
 Jesus Christ has come, and love has won

Like calm comes to a sea 
 Like snowfall quietly 
 You come to me 
 Like justice to the weak 
 Like a flood rising You come 
 You come to me 
 And it feels like it's almost here 
 Alleluia, Majesty 
 Alleluia, Risen King 
 Alleluia, angels sing 
 Like springtime to winter's hush 
 Like laughter to solemnness 
 Like a sun rising up You come 
 You come to us 
 Alleluia, Majesty 
 Alleluia, King of Kings 
 Alleluia, angels sing 
 Alleluia 
 Like a song rising up 
 With your heart filling up 
 Like a heart's not enough 
 For this love, for this love 
 To sing of love 
 To sing of love 
 To sing of love, love, love 
 Alleluia, Majesty 
 Alleluia, Risen King 
 Alleluia, angels sing 
 Alleluia, sing 
 Alleluia, sing 
 Alleluia

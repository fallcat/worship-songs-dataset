Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing over the plains 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains 
 Glory on high 
 Glory on high 
 Sing glory 
 Shepherds why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 What the gladsome tidings be 
 Which inspire your heavenly song? 
 Glory on high 
 Glory on high 
 Sing glory on high 
 Gloria in excelsis deo 
 Gloria in excelsis deo

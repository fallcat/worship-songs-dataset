A Collision album version: 
 How long till You hear us? 
 Till You come back, we ain't giving up. 
 How long till You heal us? 
 Till You come back, we ain't giving up. 
 On love rise up. 
 Hope rise up 
 How long till You free us? 
 Till You come back, we ain't giving up. 
 How long till You mend us? 
 Till You come back, we ain't giving up. 
 On love rise up.

 Your strength will come like something lifted up, something lifted up.

 Spoken: 
 We appreciate your applause 
 You seem like here and there, our visit in Japan, 
 We have met a wonderful group of people, everywhere that we've been, 
 And it seems like most everywhere that we've, uh, played, people enjoy the old time hymns.  We'd like to do one for you now, one that we've had a lot of requests for, all over Japan...

 Spoken to the end: 
 Okay, come on Shane, you're not kidding, are you all right? 
 Can youâ€¦can you explain to these fine people what just happened? 
 Okay, listen don't panic, seriously, don't panic. 
 I warned you, we're all from Texas. 
 It's true. 
 What's happened is, Shane, what's happened is, we've, we've reached, officially the bluegrass section of the evening, all right. 
 Yeah. 
 Now, there's, there's some, there's some explaining, now, now, bluegrass is based upon a very complex rhythm structure known as the boom chuck boom chuck. 
 Yes it is. 
 Exactly. And so here's the deal, here's the deal.  Now, now, this is going to be a little different, but trust us on this, okay.  We kindly ask that you do not clap upon the boom, only upon the chuck, okay.  That's, that's a big difference, a big difference. 
 And then secondly, you're gonna notice that your right foot, it comes up off the ground a bit, and, and, your leg bends at the knee, repeatedly.  You're, you're gonna embrace that, that's necessary, all right, that's gonna be necessary.  So, on the chuck, and watch the knee, okay.

God sent His Son 
 They called Him Jesus 
 He came to love, heal and forgive 
 He lived and died to buy my pardon 
 An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives 
 Because He lives I can face tomorrow 
 Because He lives all fear is gone 
 Because I know He holds the future 
 And life is worth the living just because He lives 
 And then one day 
 I'll cross that river 
 I'll fight life's final war with pain 
 And then as death gives way to vict'ry 
 I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know he lives 
 Because He lives I can face tomorrow 
 Because He lives all fear is gone 
 Because I know He holds the future 
 And life is worth the living just because He lives

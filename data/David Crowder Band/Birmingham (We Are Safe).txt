Your love is relentless 
 And I'm glad for it 
 I'm glad for it 
 Your love is relentless 
 And I am glad 
 Your love is relentless 
 And if not for it 
 If not for it 
 I'd perish for sure 
 If not for it 
 There's favor for the faithful 
 We're in the hands of God 
 Love has come and we are safe 
 Hope has come and we are saved 
 Your love is relentless 
 And I'm glad for it 
 I'm glad for it 
 Your love is relentless 
 And I am glad 
 Your love is relentless 
 And if not for it 
 If not for it 
 I'd perish for sure 
 If not for it 
 Oh we're in the hands of God 
 Love has come and we are safe 
 Hope has come and we are saved 
 We're in the hands of God 
 Love has come and we are safe 
 Hope has come and we are saved

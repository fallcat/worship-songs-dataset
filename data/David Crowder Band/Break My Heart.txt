I found my hope in you 
 And I found strength and comfort too 
 Why is the forgetting so easily done 
 Remembering hard just remember to run... 
 And I wasn't aware that I needed anyone 
 And I wasn't aware that I needed you... 
 Break my heart with the things that break yours 
 Break my heart and make it purer 
 Break my heart with the things that break yours 
 Break my heart 
 When I am weak then you are strong 
 When I am helpless you carry me on 
 Still the forgetting is too easily done 
 Remembering nothing that I should have learned

Can I lie here in Your arms 
 Can I lie here in Your arms 
 My only calm is You 
 Save me 
 Can I lie here in Your arms 
 Can I lie here in Your arms 
 My only thought is You 
 Save me 
 Can I lie here in Your arms 
 Can I lie here in Your arms 
 My happiness is You 
 Save me 
 Oh how lovely this place 
 To be with You 
 To be with You 
 Oh the brightness of Your face 
 Here with You 
 Here with You 
 Oh my only calm is You 
 Oh my only thought is You 
 Oh my happiness is You 
 Oh my happiness is You 
 To be with You 
 To be with You 
 Save me

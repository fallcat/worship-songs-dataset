 Life makes it so hard sometimes 
 To know what's real 
 When I can't feel You there

 When I can't comprehend that 
 You are there 
 You are there 
 You're everywhere 
 You are everywhere

 The peace in this place 
 Can you feel it?

 When we can't feel You there 
 When we can't see You there 
 When we can't comprehend that You are there 
 You are there

 Our God is here 
 We believe You're here

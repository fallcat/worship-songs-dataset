Dance if you're wounded 
 Dance if you're torn in two 
 Dance broken open 
 Dance with nothing to lose 
 Dance when you're wounded 
 Dance when you're torn in two 
 Dance broken open 
 Dance with nothing to lose 
 Oh, perfectly free 
 Oh, dance if you wanna be 
 Oh, perfectly free 
 Oh, dance if you wanna be 
 Church music, church music 
 Church music, church music 
 Church music, church music 
 Church music, church music 
 Change the world, change your soul 
 Fill it up, here we go, here we go 
 Change the world, change your soul 
 Fill it up, here we go, here we go 
 Change the world, change your soul 
 Fill it up, here we go, here we go 
 Change the world, change your soul 
 Turn it up, here we go, here we go 
 Oh, His is a story that saves 
 Majestic feel, feel it at a steady pace 
 Oh, His is a story that saves 
 Majestic feel, feel it at a steady pace 
 Dance if you're wounded 
 Dance if you're torn in two 
 Dance broken open 
 Dance with nothing to lose 
 Dance when you're wounded 
 Dance when you're torn in two 
 Dance broken open 
 Dance with nothing to lose 
 Oh, perfectly free 
 Oh, dance if you wanna be 
 Oh, perfectly free 
 Oh, dance if you wanna be

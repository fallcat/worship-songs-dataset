Are we left here on our own? 
 Can you feel when your last breath is gone? 
 Night is weighing heavy now. 
 Be quiet now, wait for a voice that will say… 
 Come awake, 
 From sleep arise. 
 You were dead, 
 Become alive. 
 Wake up, wake up, 
 Open your eyes. 
 Climb from your grave 
 Into the light. 
 Bring us back to life. 
 You are not the only one 
 Who feels like the only one. 
 Night soon will be lifted, friend. 
 Just be quiet and wait for a voice that will say… 
 Come awake, 
 From sleep arise. 
 You were dead, 
 Become alive. 
 Wake up, wake up, 
 Open your eyes. 
 Climb from your grave 
 Into the light. 
 Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise 
 To life, rise up, rise 
 Rise, rise, rise up, to life 
 Rise,  rise up, to life 
 Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise up 
 Rise, rise 
 Shine, shine, oh, Shine. 
 Light will shine. 
 Love will rise. 
 Light will shine, shine, shine, shine. 
 He's shining on us now.

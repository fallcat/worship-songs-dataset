The one who I've searched for 
 For so long has come 
 With open arms 
 Today is the day of glory 
 Today is the day I'm home 
 Oh day, what a day 
 Oh day, I'm yours 
 Oh day of resurrection 
 You come and find me, find me and I 
 Oh I come alive 
 Oh I come alive 
 What can I do but offer my life 
 And I come alive 
 Oh I come alive 
 Again 
 Today is the day I rise like the dawn 
 Up out of death 
 To a Son, to a Son 
 Oh day, what a day 
 Oh day, I'm yours 
 Oh day of resurrection 
 You come and find me, find me and I 
 Oh I come alive 
 Oh I come alive 
 What can I do but offer my life 
 And I come alive 
 Oh I come alive 
 Beat the drum and say no more 
 The heart and mind and soul have flown 
 Oh what am I to do 
 Oh what am I to do 
 Beat the drum and say no more 
 Drift away with you my love 
 Oh what am I to do 
 Oh what am I to do 
 But surrender 
 To you 
 You come and find me, find me and I 
 Oh I come alive 
 Oh I come alive 
 What can I do but offer my life 
 And I come alive 
 Oh I come alive

Spoken: 
 Sing this hymn together, "Come Thou Fount Of Every Blessing" 
 Come Thou fount of every blessing 
 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace 
 Streams of mercy never ceasing 
 Call for songs of loudest praise 
 And teach me some melodious sonnet 
 Sung by flaming tongues above 
 I'll praise the mount, Iâ€™m fixed upon it 
 Mount of Thy redeeming love 
 Here I raise my Ebenezer 
 Hither by Thy help I come, oh 
 And I hope by Thy good pleasure 
 Safely to arrive at home, oh 
 Jesus sought me when a stranger 
 Wandering from the fold of God, oh 
 He to rescue me from danger 
 Interposed His precious blood 
 Oh, to grace how great a debtor 
 Daily I'm constrained to be 
 And let Thy goodness like a fetter 
 Bind my wandering heart to Thee, oh 
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it 
 Prone to leave the God I love, oh 
 Here's my heart Lord, take and seal it 
 Seal it for Thy courts above, oh 
 Here's my heart Lord, take and seal it 
 Seal it for Thy courts above 
 Hey, hey

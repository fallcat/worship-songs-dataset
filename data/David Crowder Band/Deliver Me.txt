Illuminate version lyrics: 
 Deliver me out of the sadness 
 Deliver me from all of the madness 
 Deliver me courage to guide me 
 Deliver me Your strength inside me 
 All of my life 
 I've been in hiding 
 Wishing there was someone just like You 
 Now that You're here 
 Now that I've found You 
 I know that You're the One to pull me through 
 Deliver me loving and caring 
 Deliver me giving and sharing 
 Deliver me this cross that I'm bearing 
 All of my life 
 I've been in hiding 
 Wishing there was someone just like You 
 Now that You're here 
 Now that I've found You 
 I know that You're the One to pull me through 
 All of my life 
 I've been in hiding 
 Wishing there was someone just like You 
 Now that You're here 
 Now that I've found You 
 I know that You're the One to pull me through 
 Oh, deliver me 
 Oh, deliver me 
 Oh, deliver me 
 Deliver me 
 Oh, deliver me 
 Deliver me 
 Jesus, Jesus how I trust You 
 How I've proved You o'er and o'er 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus 
 Deliver me 
 Come and pull me through 
 Come pull me through

Bring us love 
 You who are love 
 Bring us peace 
 You who are peace 
 We need love 
 Oh divine love 
 We need Your peace 
 Your merciful peace 
 Bring us love 
 Oh, divine love 
 Bring us peace 
 You who are peace 
 How gracefully You come along 
 How gracefully You come 
 Glory, glory, glory 
 God is near to each one of us 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 God is near to each one of us 
 Bring us love 
 You who are love 
 Bring us peace 
 You who are peace 
 We need love 
 Oh divine love 
 We need your peace 
 Your merciful peace 
 Glory, glory, glory 
 God is near to each one of us 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 God is near to each one of us 
 Grant us reprieve from the fighting so we 
 Could just rest our head on the shoulder 
 Of the one we're at odds with 
 Forever grateful for the contact 
 And oh so glad 
 For a moments rest 
 Weeping, knowing we have been touched 
 Weeping, knowing we have been touched 
 We have been touched 
 Bring us love 
 You who are love 
 Bring us peace 
 You who are peace 
 We need love 
 Oh divine love 
 We need your peace 
 Your merciful peace 
 Glory, glory, glory 
 God is near to each one of us 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 God is near to each one of us

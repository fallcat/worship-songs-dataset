Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die 
 Lord, I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die 
 So I long for the day when I'll have new birth 
 Still I love the livin' here on earth 
 Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die 
 Once upon a time there lived a man and his name was Hezekiah 
 He walked with God both day and night but he didn't want to die 
 He cried, oh Lord, please let me live, death is close I know 
 God smiled down on Hezekiah and gave him fifteen years to go 
 Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die 
 Lord, I wanna go to heaven but I don't want to die 
 So I long for the day when I'll have new birth 
 Still I love the livin' here on earth 
 Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die 
 Jesus lived here on this earth He knew His father's plan 
 He knew that He must give His life to save the souls of men 
 When Judas had betrayed Him, the Father heard Him cry 
 He was brave until His death but He didn't want to die 
 Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die 
 Lord, I wanna go to heaven but I don't want to die 
 So I long for the day when I'll have new birth 
 Still I love the livin' here on earth 
 Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die 
 Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die 
 Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die

The day is brighter here with You 
 The night is lighter than its hue 
 Would lead me to believe 
 Which leads me to believe 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 And I am Yours 
 What does that make me? 
 My eyes are small but they have seen 
 The beauty of enormous things 
 Which leads me to believe 
 There's light enough to see that 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 And I am Yours 
 From glory to glory 
 You are glorious You are glorious 
 From glory to glory 
 You are glorious. You are glorious 
 Which leads me to believe 
 Why I can believe that 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 And I am Yours 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 You make everything glorious 
 And I am Yours 
 From glory to glory From glory to glory 
 You are glorious. You are glorious. 
 You are glorious. You are glorious.

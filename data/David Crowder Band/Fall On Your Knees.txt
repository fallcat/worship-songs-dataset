He spoke and stars came out 
 He spoke and lighting flashed and thunder broke the quiet 
 He spoke and my heart, it burst to life 
 All this mystery divine 
 Fall on your knees 
 Forgiven and clean 
 Forgiven and free 
 Oh my God, oh my God 
 It's too wonderful 
 It's too wonderful 
 A voice then all of this 
 A voice that called me friend in darkest of night 
 A voice and my heart, it burst to life 
 Fall on your knees 
 Forgiven and clean 
 Forgiven and free 
 Here we are 
 It's too wonderful 
 It's too wonderful 
 To feel this grace rescuing 
 Lifting us up, washing our feet 
 Oh my God, oh my God 
 It's too wonderful 
 It's too wonderful 
 Oh reverent love burn us up 
 Until what I was is gone 
 Holy love burn us up 
 Until what I was is gone 
 Reverent love burn us up 
 Until what I was is gone 
 Like clouds dissolve in sunlight 
 Oh wonder 
 Fall on your knees 
 Forgiven and clean 
 Forgiven and free 
 Oh my God, oh my God 
 It's too wonderful 
 It's too wonderful 
 Oh feel this grace rescuing 
 Lifting us up, washing our feet 
 Oh my God, oh my God 
 It's too wonderful 
 It's too wonderful 
 Oh wonder 
 Fall on your knees 
 In wonder 
 Fall on your knees

Love so incredible to know 
 It's never gonna go, 
 Never gonna go. 
 Love too impossible and true 
 For anyone but You, 
 For anyone but You. 
 I think I'm on the brink of something large. 
 Maybe like the breaking of a dawn. 
 Or maybe like a match being lit, 
 Or the sinking of a ship, 
 Letting go gives a better grip. 
 I'm finding everything I'll ever need 
 By giving up, gaining everything. 
 Falling for You for eternity, 
 Right here at Your feet, 
 Where I want to be. 
 I am Yours. 
 Love so indelible to know 
 You're never gonna go, 
 You're never gonna go. 
 Love too unthinkable and true 
 For anyone but You, 
 For anyone but You. 
 Maybe like a match being lit, 
 Or the sinking of a ship, 
 Letting go gives a better grip. 
 I'm finding everything I'll ever need 
 By giving up, gaining everything. 
 Falling for You for eternity, 
 Right here at Your feet, 
 Where I want to be. 
 I'm finding everything I'll ever need 
 By giving up, gaining everything. 
 Falling for You for eternity, 
 Right here at Your feet, 
 Where I want to be. 
 I am Yours forever 
 I'm finding everything I'll ever need 
 By giving up, gaining everything. 
 Falling for You for eternity, 
 Right here at Your feet, 
 Where I want to be. 
 I'm finding everything I'll ever need 
 By giving up, gaining everything. 
 Falling for You for eternity, 
 Right here at Your feet, 
 Where I want to be. 
 I am Yours

 Forever and ever and ever and ever... 
 Forever and ever and ever and ever…

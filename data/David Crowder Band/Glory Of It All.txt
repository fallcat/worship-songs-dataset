At the start 
 He was there, He was there 
 In the end, 
 He'll be there, He'll be there 
 And after all our hands have wrought 
 He forgives 
 Oh the Glory of it all is: 
 He came here 
 For the rescue of us all 
 That we may live 
 For the glory of it all 
 For the glory of it all 
 All is lost 
 Find Him there. Find Him there. 
 After night, 
 Dawn is there. Dawn is there. 
 After all falls apart 
 He repairs. He repairs. 
 Oh the Glory of it all is: 
 He came here 
 For the rescue of us all 
 That we may live 
 For the glory of it all 
 Oh He is here 
 For redemption from the fall 
 That we may live 
 For the glory of it all 
 Oh the glory of it all 
 The glory of it all 
 Oh the glory of it all 
 After night 
 Comes the light 
 Dawn is here 
 Dawn is here 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 Everything will change 
 Things will never be the same 
 We will never be the same 
 We will never be the same 
 We will never be the same 
 We will never be the same 
 Oh, The glory of it all is 
 You came here 
 For the rescue of us all 
 That we may live 
 For the glory of it all 
 Oh you are here 
 With redemption for us all 
 That we may live 
 For the glory of it all 
 For the glory of it all 
 Oh the glory of it all

Go tell it on the mountain 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 While shepherds were out watching 
 Their silent flocks by night 
 Behond throughout the heavens 
 There shone a holy light 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 It's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 It's christmas day 
 Shepard feared and trembled 
 When lo above the earth 
 Rang out the angels chorus 
 That hailed our savior's birth 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 It's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 Oh it's christmas day 
 Down in a lonely manger 
 The humble Christ was born 
 And god sent our salvation 
 That blessed christmas morn 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 It's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 It's christmas day 
 Oh it's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 Oh it's christmas day yeah 
 Oh it's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 It's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 It's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 It's christmas day 
 (Go tell it on the mountain) 
 It's christmas day

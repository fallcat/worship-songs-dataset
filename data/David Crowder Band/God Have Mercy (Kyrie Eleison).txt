Oh Lord have mercy 
 Oh Lord have mercy 
 Oh Christ have mercy 
 Have mercy 
 Oh Christ have mercy 
 Oh Christ have mercy 
 Jesus have mercy 
 Oh have mercy 
 Oh God have mercy 
 Oh God have mercy 
 Jesus have mercy 
 Oh have mercy, mercy 
 Oh my God what have I done 
 Oh my God what have I done 
 What have I done 
 Oh Lord have mercy 
 Oh Lord have mercy 
 Oh Christ have mercy 
 Have mercy 
 Oh we will bend and break 
 In such a fragile state 
 We won't be here long 
 No, we won't be here long 
 Kyrie eleison

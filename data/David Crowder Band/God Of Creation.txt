It's the way Your stars shine 
 Sometimes so bright I swear I could hear 
 It's the way Your moonlight 
 Falls on this mountain lake so clear 
 It's the way Your sunshine 
 Paints Your evening sky and 
 It's the way Your rain falls 
 To sing me to sleep at night and 
 I fall, I fall into You 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space 
 It's the way You lead me 
 The way we walk by Your waters still and 
 It's the way You hold me 
 The way You've felt all that I feel and 
 It's the way You touch me 
 The way You know when it's needed most 
 It's the way You form Your Words 
 On my heart while I rest in You 
 Carry me away 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space 
 You enter suddenly and I am lost again 
 Inside the majesty, oh I am lost again 
 And You come suddenly, 'cause I am lost again 
 Inside the mystery, oh I am lost again 
 I am lost again 
 Inside the majesty 
 Inside the mystery 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space 
 God of Creation 
 Take my breath away 
 God of the Heavens 
 In this very space

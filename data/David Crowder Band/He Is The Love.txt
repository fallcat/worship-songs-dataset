This is the place I've known 
 Here in the arms of one who loves 
 Deeper than anyone 
 His are the hands I've grown to trust 
 And this is the place I've known 
 Here in the arms of one who loves 
 Farther than I could run 
 His are the hands I've grown to trust 
 And I believe... 
 His are the hands that spread the sky 
 And His is the love that gives me life 
 And His are the broken, the needy ones 
 And He is the love

I will sing to the Lord 
 I will sing to the Lord 
 He is high above and lifted up 
 He is high above and lifted up 
 He was there for me in the desert 
 He was there for me on the mountain top 
 He was there for me when there was no water 
 He was there for me and He gave me a drink 
 In the desert He was there 
 On the mountain He was there 
 In the valley deep He was there 
 Everywhere I look my God is there

Illuminate album version: 
 Heaven came down and glory filled my soul 
 When at the cross my Savior made me whole 
 My sins were washed away 
 And my night was turned to day 
 When heaven came down and glory filled my soul 
 O, what a wonderful, wonderful day 
 Day I will never forget 
 When I was wandering in darkness away 
 Jesus my Savior I met 
 Heaven came down and glory filled my soul 
 When at the cross my Savior made me whole 
 My sins were washed away 
 And my night was turned to day 
 When heaven came down and glory filled my soul 
 O, what a tender compassionate Friend 
 He met the need of my heart 
 Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling 
 He made all the darkness depart 
 Heaven came down and glory filled my soul 
 When at the cross my Savior made me whole 
 My sins were washed away 
 And my night was turned to day 
 When heaven came down and glory filled my soul 
 O, what a wonderful, wonderful day, yeah, today 
 And O, what a glorious, glorious day 
 The day You came, came to save me 
 O, what a wonderful, wonderful day 
 The day You came and You saved me

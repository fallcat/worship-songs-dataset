From wherever spring arrives to heal the ground... 
 From wherever searching comes 
 (The look itself a trace of what we're looking for). 
 So be quiet now and wait. 
 The ocean is growing. 
 The tide is coming in. 
 Here it is... 
 Here is our King. 
 Here is our love. 
 Here is our God who's come to bring us back to Him. 
 He is the One. 
 He is Jesus, (Jesus) 
 And what was said to the rose to make it unfold 
 Was said to be here in my chest, 
 So be quiet now and rest. 
 The ocean is growing. 
 The tide is coming. 
 Here it is... 
 Here is our King. 
 Here is our love. 
 Here is our God who's come to bring us back to Him. 
 He is the One. 
 He is Jesus. 
 He is our King. 
 He is our love. 
 He is our God who's come to bring us back to Him. 
 He is the One. 
 He is Jesus, Jesus. 
 Majesty. 
 Finally . 
 Majesty. 
 Finally. 
 Here... 
 Here is our King. 
 Here is our love. 
 Here is our God who's come to bring us back to Him. 
 He is the One. 
 He is Jesus, He is Jesus. 
 He is our King. 
 He is our love. 
 He is our God who's come to bring us back to Him. 
 He is the One. 
 He is Jesus, He is Jesus. 
 Majesty. 
 Finally. 
 Here...

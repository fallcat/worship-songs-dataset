He brought me to His banqueting table 
 His banner over me is love 
 And I can feel the love 
 Of God in this place 
 We believe Your Goodness 
 We receive Your Grace 
 We delight ourselfs 
 At Your table, oh God 
 You do all things well 
 Just look at our lives 
 His banner over you 
 His banner over me 
 His banner over us 
 Is love

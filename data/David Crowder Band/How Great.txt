Illuminate album version: 
 I'm so bored of little gods 
 While standing on the edge of something large 
 While standing here, so close to You 
 We could be consumed 
 What a glorious day 
 I give up, I lay down 
 Rest my face upon this ground 
 Lift my eyes to Your sky 
 Rid my heart of all I hide 
 So sweet this surrender 
 How great Your love for us 
 How great our love for You 
 That grace could cover us 
 How great Your love 
 How marvelous, how brilliantly 
 Luminous, You shine in me 
 And who can fail to give You awe 
 To fear You, God, so sovereign and strong, yeah 
 So sweet this surrender 
 How great Your love for us 
 How great our love for You 
 That grace could cover us 
 How great Your love 
 How great Your love, love, love, love, love, love, yeah 
 What a glorious day 
 What a wonderful day, today 
 What a glorious day 
 What a wonderful day, today 
 Glorious day 
 How great Your love for us 
 How great our love for You 
 That grace could cover us 
 How great Your love 
 How great Your love 
 How great Your love

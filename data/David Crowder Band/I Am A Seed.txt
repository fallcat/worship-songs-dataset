Oh I've been pushed down into the ground 
 Oh how I've been trampled down 
 So many feet on top of me 
 I can't help but sink, sink, sink 
 Oh I've been pushed down into the ground 
 Oh how I have been trampled down 
 Lord I put my trust in thee 
 You won't turn your back on me 
 Oh I am a seed 
 Oh I am a seed 
 I've been pushed down into the ground 
 But I will rise up a tree 
 Oh I can see it won't be long 
 Till I break free from what I was 
 Your river of grace flows endlessly 
 You won't turn your back on me 
 Oh I am a seed 
 Oh I am a seed 
 I've been pushed down into the ground 
 But I will rise up a tree 
 I've been burned up in so many fires 
 From these ashes I will rise 
 Lord your power has rescued me 
 For you I'll always sing 
 Oh I am a seed 
 Oh I am a seed 
 I've been pushed down into the ground 
 But I will rise up a tree 
 Oh I am a seed 
 Oh I am a seed 
 Won't stay long here in this earth 
 When you rain your love on me 
 Lord, rain your love on me

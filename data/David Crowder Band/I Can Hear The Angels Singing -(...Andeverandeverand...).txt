(I can hear the angels) 
 Oh, I can hear the angels singing 
 As I walk this rocky road 
 For my thoughts are all of heaven 
 And my Savior's blest abode 
 (Oh I can hear the angels) 
 Oh, I can hear the angels singing 
 I can hear my Savior's voice 
 And I'll soon be singing with them 
 Though endless ages we'll rejoice 
 I can hear the angels singing 
 Of my Savior's blessed love 
 How he died to build a home 
 For his children up above 
 (Oh, I can hear the angels singing) 
 (I can hear my Savior's voice) 
 (And I'll soon be singing with them) 
 (Though endless ages we'll rejoice) 
 Oh, I can hear the angels singing 
 I can hear my Savior's voice 
 And I'll soon be singing with them 
 Though endless ages we'll rejoice 
 (Oh, I can hear the angels singing) 
 (I can hear my Savior's voice) 
 (And I'll soon be singing with them) 
 (Though endless ages we'll rejoice) 
 (Though endless ages we'll rejoice)

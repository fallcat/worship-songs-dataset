I need words 
 As wide as sky 
 I need a language large as 
 This longing inside 
 And I need a voice 
 Bigger than mine 
 And I need a song to sing you 
 That I've yet to find 
 I need you, oh 
 I need you 
 I need you, oh 
 I need you 
 To be here now 
 To be here now 
 To hear me now 
 To hear me now

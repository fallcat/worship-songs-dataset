A Collision album version: 
 I've wandered so aimless, life filled with sin. 
 I wouldn't let my dear Savior in. 
 Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light. 
 I saw the light, I saw the light. 
 No more darkness no more night. 
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light, oh. 
 I've walked in darkness, clouds covered me. 
 I had no idea where the way out could be. 
 Then came the sunrise and rolled back the night. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light. 
 I saw the light, I saw the light. 
 No more darkness no more night. 
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light, oh. 
 Just like a blind man I wandered alone. 
 Worries and fears I claimed for my own. 
 Then, like a blind man who God gave back his sight, 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light. 
 I saw the light, I saw the light. 
 No more darkness no more night. 
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light, oh.  Oh 
 I saw the light, I saw the light. 
 No more darkness no more night. 
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight. 
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light 
 There you go. - spoken 
 Then death takes me down and I breathe here no more, 
 My anthem will sound on that eternal shore. 
 When I join with the angels in heaven on high 
 Singing, "Praise the Lord, He is the light" 
 I can feel Him shine on 
 Feel Him shine on me 
 I can feel Him shine on you 
 Feel Him shine, shine, shine

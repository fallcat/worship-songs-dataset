In the end when all of this is gone 
 And all that's living has moved on 
 The sun and moon will finally set 
 The wind will lay the seas to rest 
 In the end when all our souls will rise 
 All the nations, all the sides 
 Will feel the need for that dark place 
 For I and thee in His embrace 
 In His shadow there is peace 
 In His arms there is rest 
 In His word there is hope 
 In His hands there is grace 
 In the end, no hurting 
 In the end, no yearning 
 In the end, no suffering 
 No sadness or pain 
 In the end 
 To the end when all of this is gone 
 And all that's living has moved on 
 The sun and moon will rise and set 
 The wind will bring the seas to rest 
 To the end when all our souls will rise 
 All the nations, all the sides 
 Will feel the need for this dark place 
 For I am loved and this is His embrace 
 In His shadow there is peace 
 In His arms there is rest 
 In His word there is hope 
 In His hands there is grace 
 To the end, there's hurting 
 To the end, there's yearning 
 To the end, there's suffering 
 You're waiting and waiting 
 Oh to the end 
 Oh to the end 
 When it's dark 
 Souls will shine 
 When it's dark 
 We will rise 
 We were made to live forever 
 We were made to live forever 
 We will live to live forever 
 We will live to live forever

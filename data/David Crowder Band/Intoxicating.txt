Illuminate album version: 
 Intoxicating You are to me 
 Illuminating You are to see 
 Truly breathtaking You are to breathe 
 Sending my head swimming You are, You see 
 And i've lost my mind, I'm sure I'll find 
 Need to apologize for my 
 Lack of inhibition for my belligerent condition 
 But with You this near I'm dizzy 
 Inebriating You are to me 
 Completely captivating to see 
 Sending my world spinning You are, You see 
 And now I find a blurry line 
 Here between You and I 
 Raise the cup, drink 'til I'm full 
 Sing 'til I can't, 'til my voice is gone 
 And my head is spinning 
 La, la dee da 
 La dee da, dee da 
 Dee da da da 
 Hey la, la dee da 
 La dee da, dee da 
 Dee da da da 
 Illuminating You are to see 
 Truly breathtaking You are to breathe 
 Sending my head swimming You are, You see 
 And now I find a blurry line 
 Here between You and I 
 Raise the cup, drink 'til I'm full 
 Sing 'til I can't 'til my voice is gone 
 And my head is spinning dizzy 
 La, la dee da 
 La dee da, dee da 
 Dee da da da 
 Hey la, la dee da 
 La dee da, dee da 
 Dee da da da….. 
 If I'm out of my mind it's You, You 
 'Cause I'm crazy in love with You, You 
 Inebriated by You, You 
 'Cause I'm head over heals for You, You 
 If I'm out of my mind it's You, You 
 'Cause I'm crazy in love with You, You 
 Inebriated by You, You 
 'Cause I'm head over heals for You, You 
 La, la dee da 
 La dee da, dee da 
 Dee da da da 
 Hey la, la dee da 
 La dee da, dee da 
 Dee da da da…..

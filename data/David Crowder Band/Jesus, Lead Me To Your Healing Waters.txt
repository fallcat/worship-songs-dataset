Jesus lead me to your healing waters 
 Take me down to your healing stream 
 Jesus lead me to your healing waters 
 Take me down and wash me clean 
 Many days have gone since I first loved you 
 Now I'm out here wanderin on my own 
 Never have I known more that I need you 
 Than out here wanderin all alone 
 Jesus lead me to your healing waters 
 Take me down to your healing stream 
 Jesus lead me to your healing waters 
 Take me down and wash me clean 
 Jesus purify me in your fire 
 Burn me up until I see 
 Jesus purify me in your fire 
 Burn me up until I believe 
 Many days have gone yet still I loved you 
 Never would I make it on my own 
 This life here and now is where I need you 
 And then up there is where I'm finally home 
 Jesus oh sweet heavenly father 
 Take me up and give me wings 
 Jesus oh sweet heavenly father 
 Take me up and set me free 
 Oh take me up and set me free 
 Oh take me up and set me free

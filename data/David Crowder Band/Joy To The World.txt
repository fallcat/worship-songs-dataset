Joy to the World, the Lord is come! 
 Let earth receive her King; 
 Let every heart prepare Him room, 
 And Heaven and nature sing, 
 And Heaven and nature sing, 
 And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing. 
 He rules the world with truth and grace, 
 And makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness, 
 And wonders of His love, 
 And wonders of His love, 
 And wonders, wonders, of His love. 
 Oh for joy lift up your voice 
 For Сhrist has come the Сhrist has come 
 Let the whole world see the Lord 
 Christ has come the Сhrist has come 
 Christ has come

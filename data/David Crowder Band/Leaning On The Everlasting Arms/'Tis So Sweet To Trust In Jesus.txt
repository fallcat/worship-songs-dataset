What a fellowship, What a joy divine 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 What a blessedness, what a peace that's mine 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Lord I'm leaning, leaning 
 Safe and secure from all alarms 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Oh how sweet to walk in the pilgrim way 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Oh how bright the path grows from day to day 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Oh I'm leaning, leaning 
 Safe and secure from all alarms 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 What have I to dread 
 What have I to fear 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 I have blessed peace with my Lord so near 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Oh I'm leaning, leaning 
 Safe and secure from all alarms 
 Leaning, oh I'm leaning 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Jesus, Jesus how I trust you 
 How I proved you o'er and o'er 
 Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus 
 Oh for Grace to trust Him more 
 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus 
 Just to take Him at His word 
 Just to rest upon his promise 
 Just to know, thus saith the Lord 
 Jesus, Jesus how I trust Him 
 How I proved Him o'er and o'er 
 Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus 
 Oh for grace to trust Him more

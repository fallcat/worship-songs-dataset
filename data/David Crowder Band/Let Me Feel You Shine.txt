This place is trying to break my belief 
 But my faith is bigger than all I can see 
 What I need is redemption 
 What I need is for You for to put me back on my feet 
 Wha ah ooh ooh ooh 
 Wha ah ooh ooh ooh oh 
 I swear I'm trying to give everything 
 But I feel I'm falling, oh make me believe 
 What I need is resurrection 
 What I need is for You to put me back on my feet 
 Wha ah ooh ooh ooh 
 Wha ah ooh ooh ooh oh 
 If I could feel You shine Your perpetual light 
 Then maybe I could crawl out of this tonight 
 If I could feel You feel You shine 
 Oh let me feel You shine 
 So beautiful and warm 
 So beautiful and bright 
 Like a sun comin' out of a rainy sky 
 Oh let me feel You shine Oh, 
 Let me feel You shine 
 I lift the knife to the thing I love most 
 Praying You'll come so I can have both 
 What I need is for You to touch me 
 What I need is for You to be the thing that I need 
 Wha ah ooh ooh ooh 
 Wha ah ooh ooh ooh oh 
 God I need a Savior 
 O come Generous King 
 O God I need a Savior 
 To come rescue me

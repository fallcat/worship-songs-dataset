And I will not be silent 
 And I will not be quiet 
 Anymore 
 And I will not be silent, no 
 And I will not be quiet 
 Anymore 
 No, I will not be silent, no 
 And I will not be quiet 
 Anymore 
 And I will not be silent, no 
 And I will not be quiet 
 Anymore, oh anymore 
 Anymore 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 The flowers of the field are crying to be heard 
 The trees of the forest are singing 
 And all of the mountains with one voice 
 Are joining the chorus of this world 
 Oh 
 Do you want a revolution? 
 Do you want a revolution? 
 Do you want a revolution? 
 Do you want a revolution?

Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 The flowers of the field are crying to be heard 
 The trees of the forest are singing 
 And all of the mountains with one voice 
 Are joining the chorus of this world, oh yeah 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth 
 The flowers of the field are crying to be heard 
 The trees of the forest are singing 
 And all of the mountains with one voice 
 Are joining the chorus of this world 
 The flowers of the field are crying to be heard 
 The trees of the forest are singing 
 And all of the mountains with one voice 
 Are joining the chorus of this world 
 And I will not be silent, no 
 And I will not be quiet 
 Anymore 
 Oh, I will not be silent, no 
 I will not be quiet

 And I will not be silent, no 
 And I will not be quiet

 I will not be silent, no no 
 I will not be quiet 
 Anymore 
 No anymore, oh anymore, yeah 
 Running through the forest 
 Dive into the lake 
 Bare feet on beaches white 
 Standing in the canyon 
 Painted hills around 
 And the wind against my skin 
 Every ocean, every sea, every river 
 Every stream, every mountain 
 Every tree, every blade of grass will sing 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Oh Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 All right we're going to make a joyful noise - spoken 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth 
 The flowers of the field - spoken 
 The flowers of the field are crying to be heard 
 The trees of the forest are singing 
 And all of the mountains with one voice 
 Are joining the chorus of this world 
 The flowers of the field are crying to be heard 
 The trees of the forest are singing 
 And all of the mountains with one voice 
 Are joining the chorus of this world

 Anymore 
 No, anymore, no, anymore 
 Running through the forest 
 Dive into the lake 
 Bare feet on beaches white 
 Standing in the canyon 
 Painted hills around 
 And the wind against my skin 
 Every ocean, every sea, every river 
 Every stream, every mountain 
 Every tree, every blade of grass will sing 
 La, la, la 
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth, oh yeah

Make a joyful noise to the Lord 
 All the earth 
 Make a hoyful noise to the Lord 
 All the earth 
 The flowers of the field 
 Are cry'n to be heard 
 The trees of the forest 
 Are singing 
 And all of the mountains 
 With one voice 
 Are joining the chorus of this world 
 And I will not be silent 
 I will not be quiet anymore [2x] 
 Running through the forest 
 Dive into the lake 
 Bare feet on beaches white 
 Standing in the canyon 
 Painted hills around 
 The wind against my skin 
 Every ocean 
 Every sea 
 Every river 
 Every stream 
 Every mountain 
 Every tree 
 Every blade of grass will sing

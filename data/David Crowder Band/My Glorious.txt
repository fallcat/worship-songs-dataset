God is bigger than 
 The air I breathe 
 The world we'll leave 
 God will save the day 
 And all will say 
 My glorious 
 And all You ever do 
 Is change the old for new 
 People, we believe that 
 The world is shaking 
 With the love of God 
 Great and glorious 
 Let the whole earth sing 
 Clouds are breaking 
 Heaven's come to earth 
 Hearts awakening 
 Let the church bells ring 
 My glorious 
 My glorious 
 Glory, glory 
 Send Your glory

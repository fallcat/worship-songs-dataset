Here I am again 
 In this raging sea 
 On my knees again 
 Deep calls to deep 
 I feel I'm drowning 
 My arms are 
 Just too tired to swim 
 I feel like I'm sinking 
 On my knees again 
 In the roar of Your waterfall 
 In the storm of You 
 May You find me holding on 
 May You find me true 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 And here I am again 
 In need of You 
 Broken, beaten 
 Needing You 
 In the roar of Your waterfall 
 In the storm of You 
 May You find me holding on 
 May You find me true 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 Wash me clean 
 Set me free 
 Hold me close 
 And cover me 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 And I put my hope 
 And I put my trust 
 And I put myself in You 
 In You, Lord 
 Here I am 
 Here I am

When clouds veil sun 
 And disaster comes 
 Oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 When waters rise 
 And hope takes flight 
 Oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Ever faithful 
 Ever true 
 You I know 
 You never let go 
 You never let go 
 You never let go 
 You never let go 
 When clouds brought rain 
 And disaster came 
 Oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 When waters rose 
 And hope had flown 
 Oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Overflows 
 Oh, what love, oh, what love 
 Oh, my soul 
 Fills hope 
 Perfect love that never lets go 
 Oh, what love, oh, what love 
 Oh, what love, oh, what love 
 In joy and pain 
 In sun and rain 
 You're the same 
 Oh, You never let go

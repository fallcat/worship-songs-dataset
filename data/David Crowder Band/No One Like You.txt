Illuminate version: 
 You are more beautiful 
 Than anyone ever 
 Everyday You're the same 
 You never change, no never 
 You are more beautiful 
 Than anyone ever 
 Everyday You're the same 
 You never change, no never 
 And how could I ever deny 
 The love of my Savior 
 You are to me everything 
 All I need forever 
 How could you be so good? 
 There is no one like You 
 There has never ever been anyone like You 
 Everywhere You are there 
 Earth or air surrounding 
 I'm not alone, the heavens sing along 
 My God You're so astounding 
 How could You be so good to me 
 Eternally I believe: 
 There is no one like You 
 There has never ever been anyone like You 
 There is no one like You 
 There has never ever been anyone like You 
 You, You, You, You, You, You 
 How could You be so good to me? 
 How could You be so good to me? 
 We're not alone, so sing along 
 We're not alone, so sing along, sing along, sing along 
 Here we go 
 There is no one like You 
 There has never ever been anyone like You 
 There is no one like You 
 There has never ever been anyone like You 
 There is no one like You 
 There has never ever been anyone like You 
 There is no one like You 
 There has never been anyone like You 
 There is no one like our God, yeah 
 Spoken: 
 Yeah, that's terrific. 
 We should sing together more often.

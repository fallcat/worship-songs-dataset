O come o come emmanuel 
 And ransom captive israel 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the son of god appears 
 Rejoice rejoice 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee oh israel 
 Oh come thou day-spring come and cheer 
 Our spirits by thine advent here 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight 
 Rejoice rejoice 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee oh israel 
 Oh come desire of nations bind 
 In one the hearts of all mankind 
 Bid thou our sad divisions cease 
 And be thyself our king of peace 
 Rejoice rejoice 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee oh israel 
 Rejoice rejoice 
 Emmanuel has come 
 Rejoice rejoice 
 Emmanuel has come 
 Rejoice rejoice 
 Emmanuel has come 
 He has come 
 He has come 
 O come o come emmanuel 
 And ransom captive israel 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the son of god appear 
 Rejoice rejoice 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee oh israel 
 He's coming towards us now 
 He's coming towards us now 
 He's coming towards us now 
 He always will

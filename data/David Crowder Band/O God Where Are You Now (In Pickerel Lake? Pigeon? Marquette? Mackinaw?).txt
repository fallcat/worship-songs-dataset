O God, hold me now. 
 O Lord, hold me now. 
 There's no other man who could raise the dead. 
 So do what You can to anoint my head. 
 O God, where are you now? 
 O Lord, say somehow. 
 Da da da, da da da…. 
 O God, hold me now. 
 O God touch me now. 
 There's no other man who could save the day. 
 There's no other god who could raise the dead. 
 Da da da, da da da….

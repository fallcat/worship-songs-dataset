O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining, 
 It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth. 
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining. 
 Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth. 
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, 
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. 
 Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices! 
 O night divine, o night when Christ was born; 
 O night divine, o night, o night divine! 
 Truly He taught us to love one another, 
 His law is love and His gospel is peace. 
 Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. 
 And in his name all oppression shall cease. 
 Hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, 
 With all our hearts we praise His holy name. 
 Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we, 
 His power and glory ever more proclaim! 
 Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices! 
 O night divine, o night when Christ was born; 
 O night divine, o night, o night divine!

O, for a thousand tongues to sing 
 My great Redeemer's praise 
 The glories of my God and King 
 The triumphs of His grace 
 My gracious Master and my God 
 Assist me to proclaim 
 To spread through all the earth abroad 
 The honors of Thy name 
 So come on and sing out 
 Let our anthem grow loud 
 There is one great love Jesus 
 Jesus, the name that charms our fears 
 That bids our sorrows cease 
 'Tis music in the sinner's ears 
 'Tis life and health and peace 
 He breaks the power of cancelled sin 
 He sets the prisoners free 
 His blood can make the foulest clean 
 His blood availed for me 
 He speaks and listening to His voice 
 New life the dead receive 
 The mournful broken hearts rejoice 
 The humble poor believe 
 Glory to God and praise and love 
 Be ever, ever giv'n 
 By saints below and saints above 
 The church in earth and Heav'n 
 There are so few words 
 That never grow old 
 There are so few words 
 That never grow old 
 Jesus

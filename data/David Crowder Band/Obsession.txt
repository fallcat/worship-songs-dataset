What can I do with my obsession 
 With the things I cannot see 
 Is there madness in my being 
 Is it the wind that moves the trees? 
 Sometimes You're further than the moon 
 Sometimes You're closer than my skin 
 And You surround me like a winter fog 
 You've come and burned me with a kiss 
 And my heart burns for You 
 And my heart burns... for You 
 And I'm so filthy with my sin 
 I carry pride like a disease 
 You know I'm stubborn, Lord, and 
 I'm longing to be close 
 You burn me deeper than I know 
 And I feel lonely without hope 
 And I feel desperate 
 Without vision 
 You wrap around me like a winter coat 
 You come and free me like bird 
 And my heart burns for You 
 And my heart burns... for You 
 My love for You 
 My heart for You 
 My life for You 
 All I am for You 
 Love, love for You

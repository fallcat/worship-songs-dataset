Oh great God give us rest 
 We're all worn thin from all of this 
 At the end of our hope with nothing left 
 Oh great God give us rest 
 Oh great God do your best 
 Have you seen this place it's all a mess 
 And I've done my part to well I guess 
 Oh great God do your best 
 Could you take a song and make it thine 
 From a crooked heart twisted up like mine 
 Would you open up Heaven's glory light 
 Shine on in and give these dead bones life 
 Oh shine on in and give these dead bones life 
 Let it shine, let it shine 
 On and on, on and on, come to life

Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 Friend or foe 
 Stranger or kin 
 All who come 
 Begin again 
 Hard or frail 
 Rich or poor 
 All in need 
 Need fear no more 
 Such a thing to give away 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 All regrets 
 Let go forget 
 There's something that 
 Mends all of it 
 Such a thing to give away 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 Sound the church bells let them ring 
 Let them ring, for everything can be redeemed 
 We can be redeemed, oh all of us 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race 
 Oh happiness, there's grace 
 Enough for us and the whole human race

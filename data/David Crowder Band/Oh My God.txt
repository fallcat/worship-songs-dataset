King of glory oh my Jesus Christ 
 Free me from what keeps me from your life 
 I can feel this heart beating inside 
 I don't know when I felt more alive 
 Oh my God, my God 
 Oh my God, my God 
 Let us pass oh Lord from death to life 
 Oh my God lead us into your light 
 Burning like a thousand suns at night 
 We'll sing your name until the end of time 
 Oh my God, my God 
 Oh my God, my God 
 Born all over again 
 Bring your rain and bring your wind 
 I'm born all over 
 Born all over again 
 Death will lose and we will win 
 I'm born all over

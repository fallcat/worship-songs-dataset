Victim of our sacrifice 
 Gift of love a perfect life 
 All for a wayward bride 
 All for a wayward bride 
 See the lion and the lamb 
 How he sits at your right hand 
 Waiting to come again 
 Waiting to come again 
 Oh great love of God 
 Who takes away the sin of all of us 
 Gone forever 
 Heaven open wide in a resurrection 
 You won't be denied bringing life to the dead and dying 
 Servant king of rich and poor 
 Beggar that the world ignores 
 Oh let me see your face 
 Hidden in simple things 
 Oh great love of God 
 Who takes away the sin of all of us 
 Gone forever 
 Heaven open wide in your resurrection 
 You won't be denied bringing life to the dead and dying 
 You won't be denied we will rise and we'll sing forever 
 This is not a song 
 This is a revival 
 A revival 
 This is not a death 
 This is us waking 
 This is a return back to life 
 Oh your life all I'm living for 
 Your life in my life oh it's life that I'm dying for 
 Oh great love of God 
 Who takes away the sin of all of us 
 Gone forever 
 Oh great love of God 
 Who takes away the sin of all of us 
 Gone forever 
 Heaven open wide in your resurrection 
 You won't be denied bringing life to the dead and dying 
 You won't be denied we will rise and we'll sing forever

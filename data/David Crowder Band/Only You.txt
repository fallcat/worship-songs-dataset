Take my heart, I lay it down 
 At the feet of You who's crowned 
 And take my life, I'm letting go 
 I lift it up, to You who's throned 
 And I will worship You, Lord 
 Only You, Lord 
 And I will bow down before You 
 Only You, Lord 
 Take my fret, take my fear 
 All I have I'm leaving here 
 Be all my hopes, be all my dreams 
 Be all my delights, be my everything 
 And I will worship You, Lord 
 Only You, Lord 
 And I will bow down before You 
 Only You, Lord 
 And I will worship You, Lord 
 Only You, Lord 
 And I will, I will bow down before You 
 Only You, Lord 
 And it's just You and me here now 
 Only You and me here now 
 And it's just You and me here now 
 Only You and me here now 
 And it's just You and me here now 
 Only You and me here now 
 And I will worship You, Lord 
 Only You, Lord 
 And I will, I will bow down before You 
 Only You, Lord 
 Only You and me here now 
 You should see the view 
 When it's only You 
 And it's just You and me here now 
 Only You and me here now 
 And it's just You and me here now

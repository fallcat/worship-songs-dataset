Illuminate album version: 
 Praise Him under open skies 
 Everything breathing praising God 
 In the company, of all who love the King 
 I will dance, I will sing 
 It could be heavenly 
 Turn the music loud, lift my voice and shout 
 From where I am 
 From where I've been 
 He's been there with me 
 He's built a monument 
 His very people 
 So let His people 
 Sing, sing, sing 
 And it's so wonderful 
 Just to be here now 
 Praise Him under open skies 
 Everything breathing praising God 
 In the company 
 Of all who love the King 
 Praise Him under open skies 
 Everything breathing praising God 
 In the company 
 Of all who love the King 
 Praise Him under open skies 
 Everything breathing praising God 
 In the company, of all who love the King 
 Let us dance, let us sing 
 It could be heavenly 
 Turn the music loud and sing 
 And it's so wonderful 
 Just to be here now 
 And it's so wonderful 
 Just to be here now 
 Praise Him under open skies 
 Everything breathing praising God 
 In the company 
 Of all who love the King 
 Praise Him under open skies 
 Everything breathing praising God 
 In the company 
 Of all who love the King 
 Lift your voice to heaven 
 Lift up your head and sing 
 To the One who gave His love 
 This is our offering 
 Lift your voice to heaven 
 Lift up your head and sing 
 To the One who gave His Son 
 Here our lives we bring 
 Praise Him under open skies

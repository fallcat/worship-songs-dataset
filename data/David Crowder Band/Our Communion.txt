Love, flawless unrelenting love we can know 
 Hope, sacred reverential hope starts to glow 
 In the recesses of your heart where love had flown 
 Sweet dreams of heaven changing our waking lives 
 Breath, taken in and bringing what was dead to life 
 In the recesses of your heart where love had died 
 Let it rise and lead you cross a great divide 
 Awake, looking for another way to get back home 
 Life, resurrected, swallowed death made us whole 
 In the recesses of your heart where love will grow 
 Heaven give us roots and wings and lead us home 
 Oh great God give us rest 
 No more fear from all of this 
 Oh great God give us rest 
 Let your light come down on us 
 Oh great God give us rest

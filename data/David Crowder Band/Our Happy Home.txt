Hallelujah, we are on our way. 
 Hallelujah, we are on our way to God. 
 From Egypt lately come, 
 Where death and darkness reign to seek our new, 
 Our better home where we our rest shall gain. 
 There sin and sorrow cease and every conflict's o'er. 
 There we shall dwell in endless peace and never hunger more. 
 Jerusalem, our happy home. 
 Would God I were in Thee. 
 Would God my woes were at an end. 
 Thy joy that I might see. 
 We soon shall join the throng. 
 Their pleasures we shall share. 
 And sing the everlasting song, 
 With all the ransomed there. 
 Jerusalem, our happy home. 
 Would God I were in Thee. 
 Would God my woes were at an end. 
 Thy joy that I might see. 
 There in celestial strains enraptured myriads sing. 
 There love in every bosom reigns for God Himself is King. 
 Jerusalem, our happy home. 
 Would God I were in Thee. 
 Would God my woes were at an end. 
 Thy joy that I might see. 
 Jerusalem, our happy home. 
 Would God we were in Thee. 
 Would God my woes were at an end. 
 Thy joy at last shall see.

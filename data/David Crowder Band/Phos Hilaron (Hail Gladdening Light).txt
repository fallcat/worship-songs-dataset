Hail gladdening light 
 Of your pure glory poured 
 Who is the immortal Father 
 Heavenly blessed 
 Oh holiest of holies 
 Jesus Christ our Lord 
 And now we have come 
 To the sun's hour of rest 
 The lights of evening round us shine 
 We hymn the Father, Son, Spirit divine 
 Worthiest art thou at all times to be sung 
 Oh with undefiled tongue 
 Son of our God, giver of life alone 
 Son of our God, giver of life alone 
 Son of our God, giver of life alone 
 Therefore in all the world thy glories Lord thy own

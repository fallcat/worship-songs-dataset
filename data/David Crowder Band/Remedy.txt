Here we are 
 Here we are 
 The broken and used 
 Mistreated, abused 
 Here we are 
 Here You are 
 Here You are 
 The beautiful one 
 Who came like a Son 
 Here You are 
 So we lift up our voices 
 We open our hands 
 To cling to the love 
 That we can't comprehend 
 Oh, lift up your voices 
 And lift up your heads 
 To sing of the love 
 That has freed us from sin 
 He is the one 
 Who has saved us 
 He is the one 
 Who embraced us 
 He is the one who has come 
 And is coming again 
 He's the remedy 
 Here we are 
 Here we are 
 Bandaged and bruised 
 Awaiting a cure 
 Here we are 
 Here You are 
 Here You are 
 Our beautiful King 
 Bringing relief 
 Here You are with us 
 So we lift up our voices 
 And open our hands 
 Let go of the things 
 That have kept us from Him 
 He is the one 
 Who has saved us 
 He is the one 
 Who forgave us 
 He is the one who has come 
 And is coming again 
 He's the remedy 
 Oh, I can't comprehend 
 I can't take it all in 
 Never understand 
 Such perfect love come 
 For the broken and beat 
 For the wounded and weak 
 Oh, come fall at His feet 
 He's the remedy 
 He's the remedy 
 So sing, sing 
 You are the one 
 Who has saved us 
 You are the one 
 Who forgave us 
 You are the one who has come 
 And is coming again 
 To make it alright 
 Oh, to make it alright 
 You're the remedy 
 Oh, in us 
 You're the remedy 
 Let us be the remedy 
 Let us bring the remedy

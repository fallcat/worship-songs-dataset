There's darkness in my skin. 
 My cover's wearing thin. 
 I believe. 
 I'd love to start again, go back to innocent, 
 And never leave. 
 Don't give up now. 
 A break in the clouds. 
 We could be found. 
 There's nothing wrong with me. 
 It's just that i believe things could get better. 
 And there's nothing wrong with love. 
 I think it's just enough to believe. 
 Don't give up now. 
 A break in the clouds. 
 We could be found. 
 Rescue is coming. 
 Rescue is coming. 
 Rescue is coming. 
 Rescue is coming. 
 And there's nothing wrong with you 
 And nothing left to do, 
 But believe something bigger. 
 And there's nothing wrong with love. 
 I know it's just enough to believe. 
 Don't give up now. 
 A break in the clouds. 
 We will be found. 
 Rescue is coming. 
 Rescue is coming. 
 Rescue is coming. 
 Rescue is coming now. 
 Now. 
 Come on now. 
 Come on. 
 Come now. 
 Come. 
 Oh, I want to go to heaven but I want to die

Send me a sign 
 A hint, a whisper 
 Throw me a line 
 'Cause I am listening 
 Come break the quiet 
 Breathe your awakening 
 Bring me to life 
 'Cause I am fading 
 Surround me, surround me with 
 The rush of angels' wings 
 Shine your light so I can see you 
 Pull me up I need to be near you 
 Hold me I need to feel love 
 Can you overcome this heart that's overcome 
 You sent a sign 
 A hint, a whisper 
 Human divine 
 Heaven is listening 
 Death laid love quiet 
 Yet in the night a stirring 
 All around 
 The rush of angels 
 Shine your light so I can see you 
 Pull me up I need to be near you 
 Hold me I need to feel love 
 Can you overcome this heart that's overcome 
 Oh the wonder of 
 The greatest love 
 Has come 
 Shine your light so all can see it 
 Lift it up cause the whole world needs it 
 Love has come what joy to hear it 
 He has overcome 
 He has overcome

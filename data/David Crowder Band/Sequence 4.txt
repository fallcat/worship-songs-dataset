The red of blood hit the dirt 
 And the whole earth mourned and the whole earth shook 
 As we watched the nail into a tree 
 Oh the wretched souls of sinners like me 
 God you came 
 God you came 
 My God you came down 
 God you came 
 God you came 
 My God you came down 
 Faint and weary you have sought me 
 Oh my Savior God through the cross you have bought me 
 What a love, your son for my salvation 
 What a cost, your wondrous incarnation 
 God you came 
 God you came 
 My God you came down 
 God you came 
 God you came 
 My God you came down

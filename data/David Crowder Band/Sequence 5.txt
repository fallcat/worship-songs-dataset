You left me in the dark 
 Not so much as a spark 
 Left me in the dark 
 You left me in the dark 
 You left me in the cold 
 Left me here on my own 
 Left me in the cold 
 Left me in the cold 
 You left me on my own 
 Left me all alone 
 You left me on my own 
 Left me on my own 
 You left me when I gave you all that I had 
 You left me when I gave you all that I had 
 Oh save a place for me 
 To your right hand upraise me 
 Oh save a place for me 
 To your right hand upraise me

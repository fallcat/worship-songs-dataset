Life is full of light and shadows 
 Oh the joy and oh the sorrow, oh the sorrow 
 And yet will He bring dark to light 
 And yet will He bring day from night 
 When shadows fall on us 
 We will not fear 
 We will remember 
 When darkness falls on us 
 We will not fear 
 We will remember 
 When all seems lost 
 When we're thrown and we're tossed 
 We'll remember the cost 
 We're resting in the shadow of the cross

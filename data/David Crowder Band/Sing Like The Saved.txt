 Spoken: 
 Okay, now this next part we have to have a little participation. 
 It goes like this - we're going to say, 
 "A joyful noise we will make," and then we're going to do that. 
 In the Psalms, in Psalms, the Scriptures, in Chapter 98, it says this in verse 4.  It says: 
 "Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth."  And then in the King James version, now I love this, there's a colon right after that, and then it says this: "Make a loud noise." 
 Spoken: 
 Not like a little ittie bitty, quiet, quiet noise.  A loud noise.   So, so we're going to do that right here right now.  So, one practice.  We can do it in one practice.  I'm talking like, like everything you got. 
 A joyful noise we will make, yeah 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 A joyful noise we will make 
 Sing la, la, la, la, lay 
 Sing la, la, la, la, lay 
 Sing la, la, la, la, lay 
 La, la, la, la, lay, yeah 
 Spoken: 
 All right, okay, now, this last part of the song, last part of the song 
 Right here, we're all fixing it, get yourself a little space, try it. 
 Oh, that's impossible; I see. 
 So, here's the deal, here's the deal.  Just turn to your neighbor, and say I'm sorry, I'm sorry for what's about to happen, okay.  I'm sorry. 
 But we're fixing to dance a little bit, all right. 
 When we get to the monosyllabic loud part of the song, the real loud part, everybody, everybody in this place, we're just fixing to express ourselves a little bit, okay. 
 We're all going to dance right there, all right, that's our part, that's our time.  You with me?  Yeah?  Well, up, up, up in the air, you with me?  All right.  I see that.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Fixing to dance. 
 We're gonna dance like the saved 
 If you've seen the cross - spoken 
 We're gonna dance like the saved 
 If you've seen mercy - spoken 
 We're gonna dance like the saved 
 We're gonna dance like the saved 
 Sing la, la, la, la, lay 
 La, la, la, la, lay 
 You put this joy in our hearts

Sometimes every one of us feels 
 Like we'll never be healed 
 Sometimes 
 Sometimes every one of us aches 
 Like we'll never be saved 
 Sometimes 
 When you've given up 
 Let your healing come 
 Till you're rising up 
 Let your healing come 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 We're lost in you, we're lost in you 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 We're lost in you, we're lost in you 
 Sometimes 
 Sometimes 
 It's like we'll never atone 
 For all the love we've known 
 Sometimes 
 Like in a smile or a song 
 When you feel love come 
 And that feeling's gone 
 It flies 
 When we've given up 
 Let your healing come 
 When there's nothing left 
 Let your healing come 
 Till we're rising up 
 Let your healing come 
 Where you go, we will follow 
 Where you go, we will follow 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 We're lost in you, we're lost in you 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 We're lost in your, we're lost in you 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 We're lost in you, we're lost in you 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 Don't be afraid 
 Don't be afraid 
 Just set your sail 
 And risk the ocean, there's only grace 
 Let's risk the ocean, there's only grace 
 Let's risk the ocean, there's only grace 
 Let's risk the ocean, there's only grace 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 We're lost in you, we're lost in you 
 It's your love that we adore 
 It's like a sea without a shore 
 We're lost in you, we're lost in you 
 Where you go we will follow 
 I'm on my knees 
 Where you go we will follow 
 Oh, God send me 
 Where you go we will follow 
 I'm on my knees 
 Where you go we will follow 
 Sometimes

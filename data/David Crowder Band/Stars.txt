Illuminate album version: 
 You should see the stars tonight 
 How they shimmer shine so bright 
 Against the black they look so white 
 Coming down from such a height 
 To reach me now 
 You reach me now 
 You should see the moon in flight 
 Cutting 'cross the misty night 
 Softly dancing in sunshine 
 Reflections of its light 
 Reach me now 
 You reach me now 
 And how could such a thing 
 Shine its light on me 
 And make everything 
 Beautiful again 
 You should feel the sun in spring 
 Coming out after a rain 
 Suddenly all is green 
 Sunshine on every thing 
 I can feel it now 
 I feel You now 
 And how could such a thing 
 Shine its light on me 
 And make everything 
 Beautiful 
 You should hear the angels sing 
 All gathered 'round their King 
 More beautiful than you could dream 
 I've been quietly listening 
 You can hear 'em now 
 I hear them now, oh, yeah 
 And how could such a King 
 Shine His light on me 
 And make everything 
 Beautiful 
 And I want to shine 
 I want to be light 
 I want to tell you 
 It'll be all right 
 And I want to shine 
 And I want to fly 
 Just tell You now 
 It'll be all right 
 It'll be all right, yeah 
 Oh, it'll be all right 
 'Cause I've got nothing of my own to give to you 
 But this light that shines one me 
 Shines on you 
 And makes everything 
 Beautiful, again 
 It'll be all right 
 It'll be all right

And the problem is this: 
 We were bought with a kiss 
 But the cheek still turned 
 Even when it wasn't hit. 
 And I don't know 
 What to do with a love like that 
 And I don't know 
 How to be a love like that. 
 And all the love in the world 
 Is right here among us 
 And hatred too 
 So we must choose 
 What our hands will do 
 Where there is pain 
 Let there be grace 
 Where there is suffering 
 Bring serenity 
 For those afraid 
 Help them be brave 
 Where there is misery 
 Bring expectancy 
 And surely we can change 
 Surely we can change 
 Something 
 And the problem it seems 
 Is with you and me 
 Not the Love who came 
 To repair everything 
 And I don't know 
 What to do with a Love like that 
 And I don't know 
 How to be a love like that 
 When all the love in the world 
 Is right here among us 
 And hatred too 
 And we must choose 
 What our hands will do 
 Where there is pain 
 Let us bring grace 
 Where there is suffering 
 Bring serenity 
 For those afraid 
 Let us be brave 
 Where there is misery 
 Let us bring them relief 
 And surely we can change 
 Surely we can change 
 Oh surely we can change 
 Something 
 Oh, the world's about to change 
 The whole world's about to change

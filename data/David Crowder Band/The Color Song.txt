From golden fields 
 To oceans blue 
 From green mountain meadows 
 I'll think of You 
 From rolling hills 
 With misty moon 
 From roaring rivers 
 I'll think of You 
 And everywhere you remind me 
 You are and 
 You were and 
 You will 
 Always be 
 And You are and 
 You were and 
 You will 
 Always be our God

The Sovereign Lord is my strength 
 He enables me to go on the heights 
 And I am not afraid 
 The Sovereign Lord is my strength 
 Where are the greener pastures 
 Where are the quiet waters 
 The Sovereign Lord is my strength 
 You are my green pastures 
 You are my quiet waters 
 The Sovereign Lord is my strength

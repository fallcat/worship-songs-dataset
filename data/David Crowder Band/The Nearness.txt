Brilliant bright, our salvation 
 Took the fall to hold us up 
 All the weight of our condition 
 Lifted away from us 
 Blessed love, falling under 
 Sacredness taking hold 
 Split the air, the sound of thunder 
 Heaven begins to unfold 
 And the nearness of there 
 Feels more near to here 
 We can feel the breath of the angels 
 See the walls bend and shake 
 The sky's in a tremble; let the dead wake 
 To sing the songs of the heavens 
 See the dawn start to break 
 The bond starts to loosen; feel the earth shake 
 Darkest night brought redemption 
 Innocence's divine embrace 
 In the light of all creation 
 Heaven and earth start to twist 
 And the nearness of there 
 Feels more near to here 
 We can feel the breath of the angels 
 See the walls bend and shake 
 The sky's in a tremble; feel the ground break 
 We can hear the songs of the heavens 
 See the world come awake 
 The bond starts to loosen; feel the earth shake 
 Blood of a Savior pushed back the fall 
 Love of a Healer, hell overcome 
 And the nearness of there 
 Feels so near to here 
 We can feel the breath of the angels 
 See the walls bend and shake 
 The sky's in a tremble; let the dead wake 
 To sing the songs of the heavens 
 See the dawn start to break 
 The bond starts to loosen; feel the earth shake

This is the glow 
 Deep in the soul 
 Oh when you love, oh when you love 
 The veil is torn 
 Mystery pours 
 Down from above, down from above 
 This is the glow 
 Deep in the soul 
 Oh when you love, oh when you love 
 The veil is torn 
 Mystery pours 
 Down from above, down from above 
 And yet we are all damaged it's sure 
 And so there is grace 
 Hallelujah, we rejoice 
 What a Savior, what a King 
 Hallelujah, lift your voice 
 To our Savior, to our King 
 Hallelujah, we rejoice 
 What a Savior, what a King 
 Hallelujah, lift your voice 
 To our Savior, to our King 
 Oh please tears stay 
 Where you are made 
 Do not fall, do not fall 
 Something greater 
 Is on the way 
 Just hang on, try to hang on 
 Try to hang on 
 The love of angels 
 Becomes the love of men 
 Oh heavenly light 
 Takes on earth and skin 
 Hallelujah, we rejoice 
 What a Savior, what a King 
 Hallelujah, lift your voice 
 To our Savior, to our King 
 Hallelujah, we rejoice 
 What a Savior, what a King 
 Hallelujah, lift your voice 
 To our Savior, to our King 
 What a Savior, what a King 
 What a Savior, what a King

There is a sound in the highest place 
 Of exaltation 
 Of unending praise 
 Here on the ground 
 On our brightest day in affectation 
 Of a coming reign 
 Peace on earth, let there be 
 Peace on earth, let there be 
 Peace on earth, let there be 
 Peace 
 Behold the lamb of God 
 Who takes away our sin 
 Behold the lamb of God 
 Who makes us whole again 
 Have mercy 
 He alone is holy 
 He alone most high 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Spirit, Father, Jesus Christ 
 He alone is holy 
 He alone most high 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Spirit, Father, Jesus Christ 
 There is a love, like the brightest day 
 When all is glowing 
 In unending praise 
 A beat in the chest like a hammer sound 
 Like something waking 
 To a coming reign 
 Peace on earth, let there be 
 Peace on earth, let there be 
 Peace 
 He alone is holy 
 He alone most high 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Spirit, Father, Jesus Christ 
 He alone is holy 
 He alone most high 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Spirit, Father, Jesus Christ 
 Behold the lamb of God 
 Who takes away our sin 
 Behold the lamb of God 
 Who makes us whole again 
 He alone is holy 
 He alone most high 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Spirit, Father, Jesus Christ 
 He alone is holy 
 He alone most high 
 To God be the glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Spirit, Father, Jesus Christ

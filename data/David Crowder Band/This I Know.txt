Up on the mountain 
 Where Your love captured me 
 Where finally I am free 
 This I know 
 Up on the mountain 
 Where You Taught my soul to sing 
 Amazing grace the sweetest thing 
 This I know 
 And then the storm rushing in 
 And here I am again 
 This I know 
 Take me up to where I was 
 When I never wanted more than You 
 Lift me up to feel your touch 
 It wouldn't be that much for You 
 This I know 
 This I know 
 This I know 
 This I know 
 Up on the mountain 
 Where You took me by the hand 
 Taught me to dance again 
 This I know 
 Up on the mountain 
 Where You took this heart of stone 
 Put life back in these bones 
 This I know 
 Take me up to where I was 
 When I never wanted more than You 
 Lift me up to feel your touch 
 It wouldn't be that much for You 
 This I know 
 This I know 
 This I know 
 This I know

Spoken: 
 All right, we're fixing to get a little bit uncivilized, all right? 
 So let's embrace these words, not just with our voices, but with our entire being, all right? 
 So here we go.  I will dance. 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 But I'll become even more undignified than this, oh yes 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 But I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Even now by my side 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 But I'll become even more undignified than this 
 La la la hey  la la la hey  la la la hey….. 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I will dance, I will sing to be mad for my King 
 Nothing more that's hindering, there's passion in my soul 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 But I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Even now by my side 
 I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 But I'll become even more undignified than this 
 La la la hey.  Sing la la la hey  la la la hey…. 
 It's all for You, my God 
 Amen - spoken

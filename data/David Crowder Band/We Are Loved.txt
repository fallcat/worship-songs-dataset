Velvet black night 
 Pierced with white 
 Stars waiting quiet 
 Wide listening sky 
 Stillest of air 
 Light hanging there 
 Out of despair 
 Rises a prayer 
 Can we take in Your light and shine like You with all this weariness? 
 Can we shine like You with this weariness? 
 So we are loved 
 We are loved 
 And it's quite enough that we are loved 
 We are loved 
 We are loved 
 And it's quite enough that we are loved 
 If the whole world could feel it 
 If the whole world could feel it 
 We could love 
 We could love 
 'Cause we are loved 
 Surrounded in white 
 Oh purest bride 
 No lovelier sight 
 The Church will rise 
 Take in Your light, 
 To shine like You 
 Take this weariness so we can shine like You 
 We are loved 
 We are loved 
 And it's quite enough that we are loved 
 We are loved 
 We are loved 
 And it's quite enough that we are loved 
 If the whole world could feel it 
 If the whole world could feel it 
 We could love 
 We could love 
 'Cause we are loved 
 Oh we are loved 
 We are loved 
 And it's quite enough that we are loved 
 We are loved 
 We are loved 
 And it's quite enough that we are loved 
 We are loved 
 We are loved 
 And it's quite enough that we are loved 
 If the whole world could feel it 
 If the whole world could feel it 
 We could love 
 We could love 
 'Cause we are loved

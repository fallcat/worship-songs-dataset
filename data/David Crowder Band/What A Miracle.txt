Heaven loud with glory ringing 
 Fill the air with angel's singing 
 Earth take up the heavenly cry 
 Lord of all reigns on high 
 Earth below and heav'n above 
 Resound your glory and Your love 
 Oh, King of Kings, our sacred joy 
 What a miracle You'd come for us 
 What a miracle You'd come for all 
 To save us all away 
 What a miracle You'd come for all 
 To lift us from the grave 
 Oh what a miracle so wonderful 
 You're a miracle 
 Heaven loud with glory ringing 
 Fill the air with angel's singing 
 Earth take up the heavenly cry 
 Lord of all reigns on high 
 Earth below and heav'n above 
 Resound your glory and your love 
 Oh, King of Kings, our sacred joy 
 What a miracle You'd come for us 
 What a miracle You'd come for all 
 To save us all away 
 What a miracle You'd come for all 
 To lift us from the grave 
 Oh what a miracle so wonderful 
 You're a miracle 
 Miracle, a miracle, a miracle

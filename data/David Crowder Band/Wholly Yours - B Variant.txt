I am full of earth. 
 You are heaven's worth. 
 I am stained with dirt, prone to depravity. 
 You are everything 
 That is bright and clean, 
 The antonym for me. 
 You are divinity. 
 But a certain sign of grace is this: 
 From the broken earth 
 Flowers come up 
 Pushing through the dirt. 
 And You are holy, holy, holy. 
 All heaven cries, "Holy, holy God." 
 Oh, You are holy, holy, holy. 
 I want to be holy like You are. 
 You are everything 
 That is bright and clean. 
 And You're covering me 
 With Your majesty. 
 And the truest sign of grace was this: 
 From wounded hands 
 Redemption fell down, 
 Liberating man. 
 You are holy, holy, holy. 
 All heaven cries, "Holy, holy God." 
 Oh, You are holy, holy, holy. 
 I want to be holy like You are. 
 But the harder I try 
 The more clearly can I 
 Feel the depth of our fall 
 And the weight of it all. 
 And so this might could be 
 The most impossible thing: 
 Your grandness in me making me clean. 
 Glory, hallelujah. 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah. 
 You are holy, holy, holy. 
 All heaven cries, "Holy, holy God." 
 You are holy, holy, holy. 
 I want to be holy like You are. 
 So here I am, all of me. 
 Finally everything. 
 Wholly, wholly, wholly - 
 I am wholly, wholly, wholly - yeah 
 I am wholly, wholly, whollyâ€¦Yours. 
 Here I am, everything 
 Finally, all of me 
 I am full of earth and dirt and You

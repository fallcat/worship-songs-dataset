I am full of earth. 
 You are heaven's worth. 
 I am stained with dirt, prone to depravity. 
 You are everything that is bright and clean, the antonym of me. 
 You are divinity. 
 But a certain sign of grace is this: 
 From the broken earth flowers come up pushing through the dirt. 
 You are holy, holy, holy. 
 All heaven cries, "Holy, holy God." 
 Oh, You are holy, holy, holy. 
 I want to be holy like You are. 
 You are everything that is bright and clean. 
 And You're covering me with Your majesty. 
 And the truest sign of grace was this: 
 From wounded hands redemption fell down, liberating man. 
 You are holy, holy, holy. 
 All heaven cries, "Holy, holy God." 
 Oh, You are holy, holy, holy. 
 I want to be holy like You are 
 But the harder I try the more clearly can I feel 
 The depth of our fall and the weight of it all. 
 And so this might could be the most impossible thing: 
 Your grandness in me making me clean. 
 Glory, hallelujah. 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah. 
 You are holy, holy, holy. 
 All heaven cries, "Holy, holy God." 
 Oh, You are holy, holy, holy. 
 I want to be holy, holy guys 
 So here I am, all of me. 
 Finally everything. 
 Wholly, wholly, wholly - I am wholly, wholly, wholly - 
 I am wholly, wholly, whollyâ€¦Yours. 
 I am wholly Yours 
 I am full of earth and dirt and You. 
 Here I am 
 Everything

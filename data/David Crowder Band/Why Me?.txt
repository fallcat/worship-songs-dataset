Why me Lord 
 What have I ever done to deserve even one 
 Of the pleasures I've known 
 Tell me Lord 
 What did I ever do that was worth love from you 
 Or the kindness you've shown 
 Lord help me Jesus I've wasted it so 
 Help me Jesus, you know what I am 
 Now that I know that I've needed you so 
 Help me Jesus my soul's in your hands 
 Try me Lord 
 If you think there's a way I can ever repay what I've taken from you 
 Maybe Lord 
 I can show someone else what I've learned myself 
 On my way back to you 
 Lord help me Jesus I've wasted it so 
 Help me Jesus, you know who I am 
 But now that I know that I've needed you so 
 Help me Jesus my soul's in your hands 
 Help me Jesus my soul's in your hands

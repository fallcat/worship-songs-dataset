You are the only one I need 
 I bow all of me at Your feet 
 I worship You alone 
 You have given me more than 
 I could ever have wanted 
 And I want to give You my heart and my soul 
 You are the only one I need 
 I bow all of me at Your feet 
 I worship You alone 
 You have given me more - spoken 
 You have given me more than 
 I could ever have wanted 
 And I want to give You my heart and my soul 
 For You alone are Father 
 And You alone are good 
 And You alone are Savior 
 And You alone are God 
 You are the only one I need 
 I bow all of me at Your feet 
 I worship You alone 
 Given me more 
 You have given me more than 
 I could ever have wanted 
 And I want to give You my heart and my soul 
 And You alone are Father 
 And You alone are good 
 And You alone are Savior 
 And You alone are God 
 You alone are Father 
 And You alone are good 
 And You alone are Savior 
 And You alone are God 
 'Cause I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm so alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 You alone are Father 
 And You alone are good 
 And You alone are Savior 
 And You alone are God

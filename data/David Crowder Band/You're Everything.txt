You're everything 
 I could want 
 That I could need 
 If I could see 
 You want me 
 Could I believe? 
 'Cause You're perfectly 
 All I want, all I need 
 If I could just feel You're touch 
 Could I be free? 
 Why do You shine so? 
 Can a blind man see? 
 Why do You call? 
 Do You beckon me? 
 Can the deaf hear the voice of love? 
 Would You have me come? 
 Can the cripple run? 
 Are You the one? 
 To raise me up 
 From this grave 
 Touch my tongue 
 And then I'll sing 
 Heal my limbs 
 Then joyfully I'll run to You 
 Then joyfully I'll run to You 
 You're everything 
 I could want 
 That I could need 
 I can just feel your touch 
 And I can't breathe 
 Look how you shine so 
 The blind can see 
 And how you call how 
 You beckon me 
 The deaf can hear the voice of love 
 You bid me come 
 And the cripple run 
 Are you the one? 
 To raise me up 
 From this grave 
 Touch my tongue 
 And then I'll sing 
 Heal my limbs 
 Then joyfully I'll run to You 
 Then joyfully I'll run to You 
 'Cause You're everything 
 'Cause You're everything 
 'Cause You're everything 
 'Cause You're everything 
 And I'm alive and I'll sing 
 And I'm alive and I'm free 
 And I'm alive and I'm free 
 And I'm alive and I'm free 
 And I'm alive and I'm free 
 And I'm alive and I'm free 
 And I'm alive and I'm free

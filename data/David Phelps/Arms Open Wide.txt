From another world 
 Out of the Heavens, into the earth 
 Came another love 
 A love that we've never seen or heard 
 You came and displayed Your love 
 By giving Your all for us 
 You are the High and Holy One 
 You left the glory of Your throne 
 And You gave Your life away 
 You are the Lord of everything 
 The reason for the song I sing 
 You're worthy to be praised 
 You lived and died with arms open wide 
 With arms open wide 
 From another time 
 Your will unfolded, just like You planned 
 Your spirit is alive 
 And living in the hearts of man 
 How deep Your unfailing love 
 That You would remain with us

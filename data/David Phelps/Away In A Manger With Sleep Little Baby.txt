Away in a manger, no crib for a bed 
 The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head 
 The stars in the bright sky look down where He lay 
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay 
 Sleep little baby 
 Sleep Holy Child 
 So meek and mild 
 Be near me Lord Jesus I ask You, please stay 
 Close by me forever and love me I pray 
 Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care 
 And keep us for heaven to live with You there

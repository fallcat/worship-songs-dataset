In the little village of Bethlehem 
 There lay a child one day 
 And the sky was bright with a Holy light 
 O'er the place where Jesus lay. 
 Halleluia, oh how the angels sang. 
 Halleluia, how it rang. 
 And the sky was bright with God's holy light. 
 It was the birthday of the king. 
 It was a humble birthplace but oh how much 
 God gave to us that day. 
 From the manger bed what a path was led 
 What a perfect, holy way. 
 Hark! The herald angels sing. 
 Glory to the newborn King. 
 Peace on earth and mercy mild. 
 God and sinners reconciled. 
 Joyful all ye nations rise. 
 Join the triumph of the skies 
 With angelic voice proclaim 
 Christ is born on Bethlehem. 
 Hark! The herald angels sing 
 Glory to the newborn King.

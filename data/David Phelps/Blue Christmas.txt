I'll have a blue Christmas without you 
 I'll be so blue just thinking about you 
 Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree 
 Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me 
 And when those blue snowflakes start falling 
 That's when those blue, blue, blue memories start calling 
 You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white 
 Oh, but I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas 
 I'll be so blue, baby 
 I'll be thinking about you 
 Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree 
 Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me 
 I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain 
 And when that blue heartache starts hurting 
 You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white 
 Oh, but I'll, I'll have a blue, blue, blue Christmas

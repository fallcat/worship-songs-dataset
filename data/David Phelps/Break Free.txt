Forget what you've heard about Jesus 
 If it doesn't begin and end with love 
 Did you know that you are the reason 
 He decided that He had to come? 
 He doesn't care about what's in your past 
 So whatever it is that's holding you back 
 Break free, break free 
 Loose the chains that have held you tight 
 Break free, break free 
 Cleanse all your shame in love's healing tide 
 Of mercy, sweet mercy, break free 
 There is no law that can save us 
 No way to find redemption on our own 
 Jesus stepped in and forgave us 
 So no one has the right to throw a stone 
 Release the guilt you've been holding inside 
 Step out of the darkness and into the light 
 There is a pardon when all hope is gone 
 And freedom from everything you've wrong 
 Break free from the chains that bind you 
 Break free, leave them all behind you 
 Break free, let the love of Jesus find you

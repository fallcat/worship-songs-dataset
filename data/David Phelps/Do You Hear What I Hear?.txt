Said the night wind to the little lamb, 
 "Do you see what I see?" 
 'Way up in the sky, little lamb, 
 "Do you see what I see?" 
 A star, a star dancing in the night 
 With a tail as big as a kite 
 With a tail as big as a kite. 
 Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, 
 "Do you hear what I hear?" 
 Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy, 
 "Do you hear what I hear?" 
 A song, a song high above the tree 
 With a voice as big as the sea 
 With a voice as big as the sea. 
 Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king, 
 "Do you know what I know?" 
 In your palace warm, mighty king 
 "Do you know what I know?" 
 A child, a child shivers in the cold, 
 Let us bring Him silver and gold 
 Let us bring Him silver and gold. 
 Said the king to the people everywhere, 
 "Listen to what I say!" 
 "Pray for peace, people everywhere." 
 "Listen to what I say!" 
 The Child, the Child sleeping in the night 
 He will bring us goodness and light 
 He will bring us goodness and light.

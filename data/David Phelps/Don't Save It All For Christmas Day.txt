Yeah 
 Don't get so busy that you miss 
 Giving just a little kiss to the ones you love 
 And don't even wait a little while 
 To give them a little smile, 'cause a little is enough, yeah 
 How many people are crying, people are dying? 
 How many people are asking for love, yeah? 
 Don't save it all for Christmas Day 
 Find a way to give a little love every day 
 Don't save it all for Christmas Day 
 You gotta find your way 
 'Cause holidays have come and gone 
 But love lives on, if you give on 
 But you gotta love, love 
 And how could you wait another minute? 
 A hug is warmer when you're in it, baby, that's a fact 
 And saying "I love you's" always better 
 Seasons, reasons, they don't matter, so don't hold back 
 How many people in this world, so needful in this world? 
 How many people are praying for love? 
 So don't save it all for Christmas Day 
 Find your way to give a little love every day 
 Don't save it all for Christmas Day 
 Find a way 
 'Cause holidays have come and gone 
 Oh, but love lives on, if you give on 
 Oh, you gotta, you gotta love, love 
 So let all the children know, yeah 
 Everywhere that they go 
 Their whole life long 
 Oh, let them know love, love 
 Don't save it all for Christmas Day 
 You gotta find your way to give a little love every day 
 Don't save it all for Christmas Day

Words and music by David Phelps 
 His trembling hands held the 
 Church pew that day, struggling 
 To stand when they asked him to 
 Pray. With wisdom and strength 
 His words were spoken. but his 
 Body grew weary for his wings 
 Were broken. 
 But he will fly once again. He 
 Will soar with his wings unfolded. 
 Hear the angels applaud as he 
 Rides on the wind to the arms of 
 God. And he will fly. He will fly 
 Again. 
 And on that day when he left for 
 The sky I saw him smile as he 
 Told me goodbye. No more 
 Would he weep for missed 
 Tomorrows. No more would he 
 Suffer in this land of sorrows. 
 But he will fly once again. He 
 Will soar with his wings unfolded. 
 Hear the angels applaud as he 
 Rides on the wind to the arms of 
 God. And he will fly. He will fly 
 Again. 
 I know that he's in a better 
 Place. I still dream of the day 
 When I'll see his face. Then we'll 
 Embrace, and... 
 We will fly once again. We will 
 Soar with our wings unfolded. 
 Hear the angels applaud as we 
 Ride on the wind to the arms of 
 God, and we will fly. We will fly 
 Again.

Words & music by Benjamin Gaither and

 Stop my brother there's a better road. 
 Why you wanna carry that heavy load? 
 Everybody oughta be singing freedom song. 
 You can't even move from all that's holding you down. 
 Chains you made yourself are keeping you bound. 
 And you've convinced yourself that peace can't be found, 
 So why'd you let the devil inside? 
 It's grace that gives you freedom in life. 
 Stop my brother there's a better road. 
 Why you wanna carry that heavy load? 
 Everbody oughta be singing freedom song. 
 You can change your world today. 
 Why would you want it any other way? 
 Everybody oughta be singing Freedom song. 
 Everybody oughta be singing Freedom song. 
 There was a time when I just couldn't win. 
 When my addictions made me a slave to my sin, 
 I tried to break away, but then I'd do it again, 
 Until helpless I fell down on my knees. 
 The love of the Lord made me free. 
 Stop my brother there's a better road. 
 Why you wanna carry that heavy load? 
 Everybody oughta be singing freedom song. 
 You can change your world today. 
 Why would you want it any other way? 
 Everybody oughta be singing Freedom song. 
 Everybody oughta be singing Freedom song. 
 Stop my brother there's a better road. 
 Why you wanna carry that heavy load? 
 Everybody oughta be singing freedom song. 
 You can change your world today. 
 Why would you want it any other way? 
 Everybody oughta be singing Freedom song. 
 Everybody oughta be singing Freedom song.

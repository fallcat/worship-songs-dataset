Where are the signs? Which way should I go? 
 I planned each step but now I don't know. 
 Tomorrow is a chasm of uncertainty 
 But, I will go there, if You'll go with me. 
 Gentle Savior, lead me on. 
 Let Your Spirit light the way. 
 Gentle Savior, lead me on. 
 Hold me close and keep me safe. 
 Lead me on, Gentle Savior. 
 Why can't I walk away from my regrets 
 And why is forgiveness so hard to accept. 
 My past surrounds me like a house I can't afford. 
 But You say, "Come with me; don't live there anymore." 
 And when I reach the valley every soul must journey through 
 I'll remember then how well You know the way, 
 I'll put my hand in Your hand like a trusting child would do 
 And say

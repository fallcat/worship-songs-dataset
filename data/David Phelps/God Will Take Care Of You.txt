You don't say a word, but I know you're so afraid 
 Trying hard to take a step of faith 
 You're so confused and you're so alone 
 Standing face to face with the unknown 
 Every need you have God already knows about it 
 Still He longs to hear from you 
 I believe if you put your trust in Him 
 That is where the road of faith begins 
 'Cause if His eye is on the sparrow when it comes to me and you 
 There is no place He won't go 
 And nothing He won't do 
 Like a mother cradles a child 
 His grace covers us somehow 
 So whatever you go through 
 God will take care of you 
 Change is never easy; it's just part of living 
 There's so much more that we can see 
 A higher place so far above it all 
 Is ours when we're faithful to His call 
 We don't know 
 We don't have to understand 
 The how's, the why's, the when's 
 Give it all to Him

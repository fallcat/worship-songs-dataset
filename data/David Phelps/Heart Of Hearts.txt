I used to think I could live without You 
 But I can't fool myself 
 And though temptation tells me to doubt You 
 I'd never be that cruel to myself 
 Lord, I need You to see me through 
 'Cause when all is said and done 
 What it really all comes down to 
 Is that You're the only one 
 In my heart of hearts You'll always be there 
 Always be there 
 In my heart of hearts You're my everything 
 My everywhere 
 I walk the grass that I think is greener 
 But the color fades to gray 
 Could an illusion be any meaner 
 Than the one that test Your faith 
 Lord, I need You to see me through 
 'Cause when every truth is told 
 There's a light that shines out from You 
 When the eyes of the night turn cold 
 Oh, I don't want to be the one that looks back with regret 
 I just want to be the one in faithful prayer 
 When love is waiting there 
 Lord, I need You to see me through 
 'Cause when all is said and done 
 What it really all comes down to 
 Is that You're the only one 
 In my heart of hearts

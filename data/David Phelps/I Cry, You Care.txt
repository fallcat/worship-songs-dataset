Lonely, lost and so afraid. 
 But you are only just a tear away from rushing in once again 
 To show me You're both God and Savior 
 In spite of my behavior 
 I cry, You care 
 I call, You're there 
 I fall, and You pick me up and set me on my way 
 I fear, You dare 
 I need, You share 
 I reach, and You hold me in Your arms forever 
 Glory, left behind, oh, what a wondrous story 
 Nevermind the sorrow and the care that I bear 
 When I try to live without You 
 Why do I ever doubt You? 
 I can't live without You 
 Why do I try to? 
 It's like I'm running from the air. 
 No matter where I go, You're there.

 You hold me in Your arms, 
 You hold me in Your arms forever

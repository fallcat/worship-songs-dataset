I heard the bells on Christmas Day. 
 Their old familiar carols play 
 And loud and sweet the words repeat 
 Of peace on earth, good will to men. 
 I thought how as the day had come 
 The belfries of a Christendom 
 Had rolled along the unbroken song 
 Of peace on earth, good will to men. 
 Then in despair I bowed my head 
 "There is no peace on earth," I said 
 "For hate is strong and it mocks the song 
 Of peace on earth, good will to men." 
 Then peeled the bells more loud and deep, 
 God is not dead nor does He sleep. 
 The wrong shall fail, the right prevail 
 With peace on earth, good will to men

It was 1983 
 On a snowy Christmas Eve 
 With my family 
 And the Christmas tree and lights 
 That was when it all went wrong 
 Someone turned the TV on 
 And the evening news 
 Broadcast the blues that night 
 But my dad saw my despair 
 He put his arm around me there 
 He said, "Let me tell you this 
 It's my lifelong Christmas wish" 
 He said 
 If everyone believed 
 Oh, what a happy place it would be 
 We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family 
 If everyone believed 
 Now the years have come and gone 
 But that Christmas wish lives on 
 It's the thing I pray 
 When the holidays draw near 
 You see the news is still real sad 
 And people, they're both good and bad 
 But you just might cope 
 If you spread some hope and cheer 
 So as we sing 'Joy To The Earth' 
 And celebrate the Savior's birth 
 I pull my family close to me 
 And tell them how the world could be 
 If everyone believed 
 Oh, what a happy place it would be 
 We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family 
 If everyone believed 
 And I know that it's easy to say 
 Oh, but I'm gonna dream it anyway 
 'Cause a dream becomes a song 
 And when we sing it we pass it on 
 If everyone believed 
 Oh, what a happy place it would be 
 We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family 
 If everyone believed, if everyone believed

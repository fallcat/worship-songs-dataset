When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, 
 When sorrows like a sea billows roll; 
 Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say, 
 It is well, it is well with my soul. 
 It is well (it is well) 
 With my soul, (with my soul,) 
 It is well, it is well with my soul. 
 My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! 
 My sin, not in part but the whole, 
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, 
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! 
 It is well (it is well) 
 With my soul, (with my soul,) 
 It is well, it is well with my soul. 
 And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, 
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll; 
 The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend, 
 Even so, it is well with my soul. 
 It is well (it is well) 
 With my soul, (with my soul,) 
 Oh it is well, it is well with my soul. 
 It is well (with my soul)

Someone said that in each life some rain is bound to fall 
 And each one sheds his share of tears 
 And trouble troubles us all 
 But the hurt can't hurt forever 
 And the tears are sure to dry 
 And it won't rain always 
 The clouds will soon be gone 
 The sun that they've been hiding has been there all along 
 And it won't rain always 
 God's promises are true 
 The sun's gonna shine in His own good time 
 And He will see you through

Jesus, Jesus, Oh what a wonderful Child. 
 Jesus, Jesus, so lowly meek and mild. 
 New life, new hope, new joy He brings. 
 Won't you listen to the angels sing! 
 Glory, glory, glory to the newborn King! 
 He was herald by an angel 
 Born in a lowly manger 
 The virgin Mary was His mother 
 And Joseph was His earthly father. 
 Oh three wise men came from afar 
 And they were guided by a shining star 
 To see King Jesus where He lay 
 In a manger filled with hay. 
 Jesus, Jesus, Mary's Baby 
 Jesus, God's only Son

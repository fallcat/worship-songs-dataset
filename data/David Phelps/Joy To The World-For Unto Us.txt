Joy to the world the Lord is come 
 Let earth receive her King. 
 Let every heart prepare Him room 
 And Heaven and Nature sing 
 And Heaven and Nature sing 
 And Heaven, and Heaven and nature sing. 
 Joy to the earth the Savior reigns. 
 Let men their songs employ 
 While fields and floods, rock, hills, and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy. 
 For unto us a child is born. 
 Unto us a son is given. 
 Unto us a son is given. 
 For unto us a child is born. 
 Unto us a son is given. 
 Unto us a son is given. 
 And the government shall be upon His shoulder 
 And His name shall be called 
 Wonderful, Counselor, the Might God 
 The Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. 
 The Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. 
 He rules the world with truth and grace 
 And makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders, wonders of His love.

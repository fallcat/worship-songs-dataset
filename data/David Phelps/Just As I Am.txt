Dear Lord, I'm on my knees again 
 I come to You because You understand 
 I've tried so hard, but I just can't change myself 
 That's why I know I need Your help 
 So here I am 
 This in my plea 
 My only hope is Your love for me 
 I'm reaching out 
 So desperately 
 Come take my hand; take all of me 
 Just as I am 
 Oh Lord, You make what's broken new 
 Why can't I just learn to follow You 
 I want to know You and feel You in my soul 
 I surrender all control 
 I am not afraid to follow You where You lead me 
 I can leave the past behind me 
 I'm forgiven and I'm free

The other day I passed the place 
 You always liked to go 
 And I picked up the phone because 
 I thought you'd want to know 
 But I forgot you weren't there 
 I miss you all these days 
 That I'm reminded of your smile 
 And the funny things you'd say 
 I miss you most at Christmas 
 You were like a little kid 
 You always loved a good surprise 
 And now I must admit 
 That I long more for heaven 
 Than I ever did before 
 You give me one more reason 
 And each day I want it more 
 Knowing we can spend a lifetime 
 Reminiscing on the past 
 Knowing I will see your face again 
 Where tender moment last 
 It makes me wanna be there 
 Knowing I won't be alone 
 Knowing you'll be there makes it easy to go home 
 You left a group of fishermen 
 Somehow you left me too 
 And though I've felt you many times 
 And know you saw me through 
 I've always long to feel your arms 
 And look into your eyes 
 And talk forever me and you 
 Somewhere in paradise

He was the kind of man that good men talk about 
 The way he showed his faith was how he lived it out. 
 His hands were rough and calloused and his shoes were old and torn 
 And the lines that framed his smile were lines so well and deep and worn. 
 So what will be remembered of what he left behind? 
 What will stand the test of time? 
 How to love your neighbor and how to love your wife 
 Wrap your arms around your children and pray with them each night. 
 Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough 
 The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love. 
 He worked a second job to make the ends all meet 
 But somehow managed to always be there for me. 
 Showed me how to listen and how to stand for what is right 
 And taught me all the things that really matter in this life. 
 As I look into the eyes of my daughters and my sons 
 I hope I've stood for something that they'll want to carry on 
 'Cause life is far too short not to finally realize 
 That its long enough to make a difference in someone's life. 
 So I'm gonna love my neighbor and I'm gonna love my wife 
 Wrap my arms around my children and pray with them each night. 
 Thank God for all the good things cause the good things are enough 
 The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

Here we stand with our hand up high 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Give us a reason to testify 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Oh, break the chains, tear down the walls 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 We wanna feel it when the spirit falls 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Oh, we sing glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Oh, glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 With a force that we can't explain 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Oh, let it fall like a holy rain 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Oh, bring it on, bring it strong, bring us to our knees 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Show us Your presence, Holy Spirit, please 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Oh, we sing glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Oh, glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Oh, we sing glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Oh, glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Now we're gonna praise His name 
 (Praise His holy name) 
 Let the glory come down 
 (Praise His holy name) 
 Let the glory come down, and down, and down 
 (Praise His holy name) 
 Let the glory come down 
 (Praise His holy name) 
 Praise Him, let the glory come down 
 There's a hunger down in our souls 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Glory, let us see where the glory rolls 
 (Let the glory come down) 
 Oh, we sing glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Oh, glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Oh, we sing glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Oh, glory, glory, let the glory come down 
 Break the chains - we want to testify 
 Bring it on, bring it strong 
 All the glory, let the glory come down

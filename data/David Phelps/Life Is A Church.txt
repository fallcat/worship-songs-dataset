Watching the surf cover up my toes 
 Breathing the salt air from the coast. 
 Ten years old with my eyes pressed closed. 
 Life is a church. 
 Remembering first love's tender kiss. 
 Mourning the loss of my innocence, 
 The bittersweet taste of it on my lips. 
 Life is a church. 
 These are the sacraments. 
 This is the altar. 
 Love is the spirit 
 Making the blue planet turn. 
 Life is a church. 
 Watching my baby being born 
 Written all over you, pain and joy 
 Holding your hand, it's a little boy. 
 Ashes to ashes, earth to earth. 
 The preacher throws in the first handful of dirt. 
 My little boy asks me, "Does goodbye always hurt?"

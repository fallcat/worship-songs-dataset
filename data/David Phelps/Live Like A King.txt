My thirst for the things of this earth 
 Isn't quenched by diamonds or pearls 
 One Man lived the life that I want 
 He's the One they said ruled the world 
 Though He only wore a crown of thorns 
 And He never owned a thing 
 I want to live like a King 
 I want to live like a King 
 And my decree it will ring 
 "Love will rule everything" 
 I want to live like a King 
 This King did the strangest of things 
 He befriended the sick and the poor 
 There was no one too wrong, too right, too black, too white for Him to 
 Love 
 He built no walls, left no unopened doors 
 Well, now I could croon a million other tunes 
 There is just one I want to sing 
 I want to be stronger, I want to be wiser 
 I just want to make every move be the one He'd want to see from me 
 There's just such power, such healing power 
 In every word that He said, in every deed that He did

Will somebody please tell me 
 How did I end up in this crazy place 
 There must be something wrong with this mirror 
 'Cause I don't recognize my own face 
 Well I guess I'm just a modern day prodigal son 
 But You're looking at me like I'm a chosen one 
 With Your arms open wide, now I've lost all my pride 
 And I'm yours, I'm yours 
 It's been a long time coming 
 Been a twelve round fight 
 Been a thousand nights of darkness 
 But I finally see the light 
 Seems my never ending search is coming to an end 
 It's been a long time coming 
 I'm coming home, home 
 Lord, now that You've pulled back the curtains 
 I can see You everywhere 
 And I wanna empty out all my pockets 
 Till there's only one thing that's there 
 'Cause I can't have nothing holding me down 
 When I'm on my way to You 
 You're my life, You're my love 
 And You're all I know that's true 
 Well now everybody says that you don't know what you've got till it's gone 
 Well now it's gone and I know 
 And I want it back, so here I go, here I go, here I go, go, go

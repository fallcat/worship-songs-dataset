Away in a manger no crib for a bed 
 The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head. 
 The stars in the bright sky look down where He lay 
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. 
 Silent night, holy night 
 All is calm, all is bright 
 Round yon virgin, mother and child 
 Holy infant so tender and mild. 
 Sleep in heavenly peace 
 Sleep in heavenly peace. 
 O little town of Bethlehem how still we thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by. 
 We hear the Christmas angels their great glad tidings tell 
 O come to us abide with us our Lord Emmanuel. 
 O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant 
 O come ye o come ye to Bethlehem. 
 Come and behold Him born the king of angels. 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord.

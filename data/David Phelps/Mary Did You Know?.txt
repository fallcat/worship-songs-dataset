Mary did you know that your baby boy 
 Will one day walk on water? 
 Mary did you know that your baby boy 
 Will save our sons and daughters? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Has come to make you new? 
 This child that you've delivered 
 Will soon deliver you. 
 Mary did you know that your baby boy 
 Will give sight to a blind man? 
 Mary did you know that your baby boy 
 Will calm a storm with His hand? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Has walked where angels trod? 
 When you kiss your little baby 
 You've kissed the face of God? 
 Mary did you know? 
 Mary did you know? 
 The blind will see 
 The deaf will hear 
 And the dead will live again. 
 The lame will leap 
 The dumb will speak 
 The praises of the Lamb. 
 Mary did you know that your baby boy 
 Is Lord of all creation? 
 Mary did you know that your baby boy 
 Will one day rule the nations? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Is Heavens perfect Lamb? 
 This sleeping child you're holding 
 Is the Great I AM!

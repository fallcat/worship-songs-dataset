You tired to run so that no one could desert you 
 Always looking for the perfect place to hide 
 You build up walls so that no one could ever hurt you 
 And yet the loneliness made you cry 
 Bridges all burned 
 No where to turn 
 But to Heaven 
 Miles and Miles away 
 Love saw you there 
 Stretched His hand to reach you 
 Across the lonely ocean of your tears 
 And He'll walk upon the waves 
 If that's what it takes to save you 
 Love doesn't have the heart to stay 
 Miles and miles away 
 He has the grace to cover any distance 
 Always looking for the lost and weary soul 
 But though he never stops offering forgiveness 
 And to the one to run, welcome home 
 Sorrow no more 
 Jesus is Lord! 
 Down from heaven 
 Miles and miles away 
 Love saw you there 
 Stretched His hand to reach you 
 Across the lonely ocean of your tears 
 And He'll walk upon the waves 
 If that's what it takes to save you 
 Love doesn't have the heart to stay 
 Miles and miles away 
 Through the day or night 
 Day or life 
 Could ever separate us 
 From the love the stands the ages 
 Miles and miles away 
 Love saw you there 
 Stretched His hand to reach you 
 Across the lonely ocean of your tears 
 And He'll walk upon the waves 
 If that's what it takes to save you 
 Love doesn't have the heart to stay 
 Miles and miles away

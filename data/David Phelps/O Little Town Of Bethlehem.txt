O little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting Light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in thee tonight 
 O Holy Child of Bethlehem 
 Descend to us, we pray 
 Cast out our sin and enter in 
 Be born in us today 
 We hear the Christmas angels 
 The great glad tidings tell 
 O come to us, abide with us 
 Our Lord Emmanuel 
 O come to us, abide with us 
 Our Lord Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel

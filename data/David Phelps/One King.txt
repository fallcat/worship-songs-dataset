In the beginning there was the Word 
 Pure love was spoken to reach every man 
 They stopped and listened but all that they heard 
 Was language that they could not understand 
 No joy, no peace, no hope in sight 
 So He came with starlight and love in His eyes 
 No regal welcome for His infant cries 
 There have been many babies to become a king 
 But only one King became a baby 
 He left behind His throne of pure light 
 Gave up His crown that we might be free 
 He chose a manger that Bethlehem night 
 And reaching through time and space He saw me 
 With no joy, no peace, no hope in sight 
 So He came with starlight and love in His eyes 
 No regal welcome for His infant cries 
 There have been many babies to become a king 
 But only one King became a baby 
 He could have chosen to break through the sky 
 With anthem and angel wing 
 But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry 
 And learn love from a servant King 
 So He came with starlight and love in His eyes 
 No regal welcome for His infant cries 
 There have been so many babies to become a king 
 Only one King, one King became a baby

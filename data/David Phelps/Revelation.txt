The last thing that I remember 
 I think it was mid-December 
 I rolled out of bed to take on another day 
 Of bills to pay 
 Oh, I should have noticed the signs 
 When reading the morning headlines 
 But all I could see is what mattered then and there 
 Like what to wear 
 Before I left for work I kissed my wife and kids goodbye 
 But fumbling for my keys my eyes were drawn up to the sky 
 Sky is blackened, could it be a thunderstorm, it looks like rain. 
 Wind is twirling, clouds are swirling, could it be a hurricane? 
 I pulled myself together 
 And said it was just the weather 
 'Cause I never dreamed it could be my final day 
 To live that way 
 Yeah, I went to church on Sundays 
 Believed there was only one way 
 But when it began I guess I was in denial 
 For just a while 
 So I turned on the radio to occupy my mind 
 But as I drove to work my thoughts were pulled back to the sky 
 Sky is blackened, could it be a thunderstorm, it looks like rain. 
 Wind is twirling, clouds are swirling, could it be a hurricane? 
 Then suddenly the sun eclipsed and tremors struck the ground 
 As brilliant light had split the sky I heard the trumpet sound! 
 Halleluia, Halle-Halleluia O the angels sang. 
 Halleluia, Halle-Halleluia finally redeemed. 
 Halleluia, Halle-Halleluia prophecy fulfilled 
 Jesus is revealed! 
 Revelation, Revelation, Revelation, Revelation! 
 Amen!

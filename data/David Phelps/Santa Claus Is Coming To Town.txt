I just came back from a trip along the Milky Way 
 I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday 
 I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see 
 He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me 
 Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time to play 
 He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas Day 
 You better write your letter now and mail it right away 
 Because he's getting ready his reindeers and his sleigh 
 You better watch out, you better not cry 
 You better not pout, I'm telling you why 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 He's making a list and checkin' it twice 
 He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 He sees when you're sleeping 
 He knows when you're awake 
 He knows if you've been bad or good 
 So be good for goodness sake 
 Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry 
 You better not pout, I'm telling you why 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 The kids in girl in boy land 
 Will have a jubilee 
 They're gonna build a Toyland 
 All around the Christmas tree 
 So you better watch out, you better not cry 
 You better not pout, I'm telling you why 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 Santa Claus is coming to town

Kings and shepherds make their way 
 Straight to where a baby lay 
 Rich and poor and lonely 
 Bow before this sight 
 A star has led them to this place 
 The word that's been echoing through space 
 Becomes a child tonight 
 Light to shine in the darkest night 
 Light to make all the wrong things right 
 Light to show everyone the way 
 Light to shine where a virgin lay 
 Tonight 
 Angel voices fill the air 
 Angel wings are everywhere 
 Light so bright it's blinding 
 Shepherds shake with fright 
 A warmth begins to flood the hill 
 Fear not, peace to you good will 
 Comes to earth tonight 
 Light to shine in the darkest night 
 Light to make all the wrong things right 
 Light to show everyone the way 
 Light to shine where a virgin lay 
 Tonight 
 Light will be so bright 
 It will shine through the darkest night 
 Send down Your holy light 
 Star of David, the Prophet's star 
 Yahweh, God come to where we are 
 Star to mark the Messiah's birth 
 Star of heaven now touches earth 
 Light to shine in the darkest night 
 Light to make all the wrong things right 
 Light to show everyone the way 
 Light to shine where a virgin lay 
 Tonight

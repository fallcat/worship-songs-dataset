I've been thinking 'bout this Christmas 
 And those gifts beneath the tree 
 Oh, I'm sure each one is special 
 But no present interests me 
 But there's just one thing on my list 
 That you can't buy at any store 
 It's wrapped in red and white 
 And it's all I'm asking for, oh, oh 
 I just wanna see Santa Clause tonight 
 To hear him pull out when his sleigh takes flight 
 Merry Christmas to all and to all goodnight 
 I just wanna see Santa Clause tonight, yeah, yeah 
 Don't you give me no story about no snowman 
 With his eyes made out of coal, no, no, no, no 
 I don't want a chilly Jack Frost 
 He ain't got that jolly soul 
 I've been waiting by the fireplace 
 Where I hear his sleigh outside 
 And I say, "Hello", he'll say, "Ho, ho, ho" 
 As he takes that chimney ride 
 I just wanna see Santa Clause tonight 
 To hear him pull out when his sleigh takes flight 
 Merry Christmas to all and to all goodnight 
 I just wanna see Santa Clause tonight, yeah, yeah 
 Then we'll go for a sleigh ride 
 And the reindeer'll lead us on 
 I'll be sitting right by his side 
 It'll last the whole night long 
 I just wanna see, I just wanna see Santa Clause tonight 
 To hear him pull out when his sleigh takes flight 
 Merry Christmas to all and to all goodnight 
 I just wanna see 
 I just wanna see Santa Clause tonight 
 Looking for a reindeer take flight 
 Merry Christmas to all and to all goodnight 
 I just wanna see a Santa Clause tonight 
 Santa Clause, Santa Clause, yeah 
 Santa Clause, tonight

You know it ain't about the money 
 Or the power 
 Or the fame. 
 It's not about a great position 
 It's not religion 
 It's not a game. 
 "Take up your cross and follow me" was not a guarantee 
 That the road would not be rough. 
 So you ask me, what's the big attraction? 
 Peace, love, hope, satisfaction 
 It's a complete chain reaction - 
 Peace, love, hope, satisfaction. 
 I've heard the stories of the narrow road 
 Some say it's a heavy load 
 And the way is steep. 
 I've been there I can testify 
 The vows of sacrifice are hard to keep 
 But still I choose to turn the other cheek 
 And to wash my brother's feet 
 And to give myself away. 
 When I'm trapped inside His freedom 
 And I'm lying on the altar 
 And the last part of myself has been crucified 
 When I'm wearing all His riches 
 In the ashes of my will 
 I am clean, I am whole, I am satisfied.

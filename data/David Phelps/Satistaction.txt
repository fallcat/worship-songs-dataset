God in Heaven hear my prayer 
 For the suffering here below 
 Of the innocent and pure 
 And the many without hope 
 I am just a simple man 
 Still believing in a dream 
 Of a world that's ruled by love 
 Only You can intervene 
 Perdoname Dios 
 Do You hear my cry? 
 Perdoname Dios 
 Can I ask You why 
 This world's cruel injustice never seems to cease? 
 With pity and mercy, heed this prayer for peace 
 Perdoname, Perdoname 
 Perdoname Dios 
 I see love in many things 
 In the mountains and the sky 
 In a flower as it blooms 
 In a newborn baby's cry 
 But there are also broken hearts 
 Warring nations, ruined lands 
 Desperate families torn apart 
 Lord, help me to understand

There is someone who cares 
 Oh there's someone who dares 
 To love you and His arms are open wide 
 Waiting there for you to run inside 
 There is someone who cares 
 And when you reach for Him He's there 
 I pray you'll learn somehow, somewhere 
 Jesus is that someone who cares 
 One mistake made in your past holds to you 
 Hard and fast and mocks what might have been 
 There's no place for you to hide 
 You know 'cause you have tried 
 Time and time again 
 I'm not 'gonna stand here and tell you 
 Everything's 'gonna be alright 
 There is no way that I could know 
 Just what you're going through tonight 
 Oh but there's someone who cares 
 There is someone who dares 
 To love you and His arms are open wide 
 Waiting there for you to run inside 
 There is someone who cares 
 And when you reach for Him He's there 
 I pray you'll learn somehow somewhere 
 That Jesus is that someone who cares 
 I can see it hurts you bad 
 I don't want to see you sad 
 Just open up your heart to find the Love like you've never ever had 
 There is someone who cares 
 Yeah, there's someone who dares 
 To love you and his arms are open wide 
 Waiting there for you to run inside 
 There is someone who cares 
 Oh, and when you reach for Him He's there 
 I pray you'll learn somehow, somewhere 
 That Jesus is that someone who cares 
 I pray that somehow, and somewhere 
 You'll learn that Jesus is that someone who cares 
 I know Jesus really really cares

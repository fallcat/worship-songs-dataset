I used to ride my bike down the street three miles 
 And no one ever thought about it twice 
 Cause everybody looked out for everybody else. 
 I was never ever, ever by myself. 
 Now it's slippin' away and 
 I need You to save me right now, right now. 
 Something's gotta change. 
 The beauty of the pain 
 Is that we do not stay the same 
 But we grow and we show 
 We are stronger than before. 
 When we reach for something more 
 And in the face of hate 
 Pour out love like rain. 
 Something's gotta change. 
 I don't wanna be just another put-on. 
 Yeah, tell me where has my heart gone. 
 I need to believe faith isn't just a word 
 That I stutter to the hurt inside 
 I need to see it and be it 
 The realness of Jesus right now, right now. 
 It could be beautiful and brand new 
 But only if it's me hand in hand with You.

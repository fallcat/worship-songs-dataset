It's the only thing worth life and death. 
 It's the first moment and the final breath. 
 It's a broken heart keeping a solemn vow 
 And a lost soul being found. 
 You pray for faith when it's hard to believe. 
 You choose to stay when it's easy to leave 
 And when hope is gone you're the one who keeps holding on. 
 That's what love is 
 When you give until there's nothing left 
 And it makes you give the very best. 
 That's what love is. 
 It can make you laugh and make you cry. 
 It can let you down and lift you up so high 
 When you find the only reason left to live. 
 That's what love is. 
 It's the dream you give up for someone else. 
 It's being strong when you're weak yourself. 
 Though it tears you up you trust again. 
 Hatred loses and forgiveness wins. 
 You turn your cheek when you want to fight. 
 Sell all you have and lay down your life 
 And when hope is gone you're the one who keeps holding on. 
 It's reaching out and holding on so someone else will know. 
 Love is in the not letting go.

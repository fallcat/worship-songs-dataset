It stands to reason that a name is just a word. 
 It can be easily forgotten just as soon as it is heard. 
 But one name was spoken before the world's first day 
 And it will be here when everything that is has passed away. 
 Delivered from the lips of God 
 To Mary's ears on angel wings 
 Jesus, Jesus. 
 The word that came to life for us. 
 The song that all creation sings. 
 Jesus, Jesus. 
 The proudest nations of the earth have come and gone 
 But Jesus, the name lives on. 
 When I'm awakened by a terrifying dream 
 And desperation reaches up and clutches me 
 When I am so afraid that I don't know what to pray 
 I simply speak it and feel it and it chases fear away. 
 Eternal hope and promise, the ever-breaking dawn 
 When time itself is over, the name lives on.

The music began at his command 
 And the singer drew his breath 
 The melody rose and dawned on the land 
 And pierced the emptiness 
 And from a barren and lonely place 
 Life began to spring 
 And on the stage of time and space 
 God threw back His head and began to sing 
 Let there be light 
 Invade the darkness 
 Fill up the void 
 Replace the noise with sweet harmony 
 And let there be joy 
 And echoes of laughter 
 And the singer sings on 
 And still writes the song of the redeemed 
 Now though beautifully sung, the song went unheard 
 And darkness returned again 
 But God had a plan in the second verse 
 To win back the hearts of men 
 A star rose up in the eastern sky 
 That night in Bethlehem 
 And as the Baby Jesus cried 
 God sang out His song and the angels joined in 
 Let there be light 
 Invade the darkness 
 Fill up the void 
 Replace the noise with sweet harmony 
 And let there be joy 
 And echoes of laughter 
 And the singer sings on 
 And still writes the song of the redeemed 
 And every time a soul receives 
 That joyful Christmas song 
 He rises from His throne 
 And all creation sings along

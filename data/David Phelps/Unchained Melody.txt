Oh my love, my darling 
 I've hungered for your touch 
 A long, lonely time 
 Oh, and time goes by so slowly 
 And time can do so much 
 Are you still mine? 
 I need your love 
 Oh, I need your love 
 God speed your love to me 
 Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea 
 To the open arms of the sea 
 Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me 
 I'll be coming home, wait for me 
 Oh my love, my darling 
 I've hungered, hungered for your touch 
 A long, lonely time, oh 
 And time goes by so slowly 
 And time can do so much 
 Are you, are you still mine? 
 Oh, I need your love, your love 
 Oh, I need, I need your love 
 God speed, God speed your love to me 
 Oh no, baby, God speed your love to me 
 Oh, are you, are you still mine? 
 I need your love 
 I need your love, oh

Virtuoso-David Phelps 
 A handful of dust a worthless piece of clay 
 And you breathed the breath of heaven 
 Then there was a soul 
 The heart, the hands, the voice that could sing of your perfection 
 Life is a symphony that only you can play 
 You know I can hear it through the madness everyday 
 Virtuoso, virtuoso 
 This heart is your instrument 
 This life is your song 
 Virtuoso 
 There isn't a note of mediocrity 
 In all of your creation and all the beauty 
 We create with human hands is only imitation 
 Thunder crashes, waves crescendo on the sand 
 The wind that's whispering can only be your hand 
 Virtuoso, virtuoso 
 This heart is your instrument 
 This life is your song 
 Virtuoso 
 A timeless melody of beauty and emotion 
 Perfect harmony inspiring true devotion 
 No one else can play its chords so graceful yet so strong 
 You made the instrument and wrote the song 
 Virtuoso 
 Virtuoso, virtuoso 
 This heart is your instrument 
 This life is your song 
 Virtuoso

She gently falls asleep 
 Her head is laid upon my lap. 
 The highway sings a soothing lullaby. 
 My daughter here beside me 
 My little boy is in the backseat 
 Outlined by the headlights from behind. 
 I ask the Lord to freeze us here in time 
 As my son reaches out his hand to mine. 
 Silhouettes sent from Heaven 
 Paint a portrait of eternal things. 
 A fleeting glimpse like a vapor 
 Brings remembrance of what is holy. 
 Clean and pure, unblemished and unflawed 
 Oh, come to me sweet visions of God. 
 I hear her whisper sweetly 
 "I made this for you, Daddy." 
 Her crayon masterpiece says, "I love you". 
 At last a bedtime story 
 They rush to get beneath the sheets (They gather underneath the sheets) 
 For Peter Pan, Pinocchio, and Pooh. 
 They cling to every word until the end 
 Then they close their eyes and drift to Neverland. 
 So often I have missed Him 
 Like a shadow in the night 
 A familiar face I fail to recognize 
 But He is there in pigtails, 
 Peek-a-boo and piggyback rides 
 A kiss, a gentle touch, a baby's cry.

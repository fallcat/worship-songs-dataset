Who am I that the song of God would shine on me 
 And bring His light into my dark 
 Even though I'm a runner and I like to hide 
 He found His way into my heart 
 So I sing, holy to the Lamb of God who made me good enough 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart 
 With His love, with His love 
 Now and then I forget that I belong to Him 
 And I strike out on my own 
 Faithful is the one who called me by my name 
 And gently leads me back home 
 So I sing, holy to the Lamb of God who made me good enough 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart 
 I sing, holy to the Lamb of God who makes me good enough 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart 
 With His love, with His love 
 No matter where I go 
 And no matter what I do I know 
 I will never be too far away from You 
 So I sing, holy to the Lamb of God who made me good enough 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart 
 I sing, holy to the Lamb of God who makes me good enough 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart 
 With His love, with His love 
 So I sing, so I sing holy 
 I sing holy, I sing holy

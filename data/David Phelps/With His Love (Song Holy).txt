Who am I that the Son of God would shine on me 
 And bring His light into my dark. 
 Even though I'm a runner and I like to hide 
 He found His way into my heart. 
 So I sing 
 Holy to the Lamb of God who made me good enough 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart with His love 
 With His love. 
 Now and then I forget that I belong to Him 
 And I strike out on my own 
 Faithful is the One who called me by my name 
 And gently leads me back home. 
 So I sing 
 Holy to the Lamb of God who makes me good enough. 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart. 
 Holy to the Lamb of God who makes me good enough. 
 Glory to the King who captured my heart 
 With His love, with His love. 
 No matter where I go I know 
 No matter what I do I know 
 I will never be too far away 
 From You, I sing.

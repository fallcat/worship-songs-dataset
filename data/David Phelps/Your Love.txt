Sometimes when I'm weary 
 All I have for strength is You 
 And sometimes when I am cold 
 All I have to keep me warm is You 
 So I close my eyes 
 And fold my hand 
 And You're right there 
 To be my friend 
 Your love 
 Is just a prayer away 
 And Your love is all I need 
 To face another day 
 Sometimes when I'm lonely 
 All I have for company is You 
 Sometimes when I cry 
 All I have to comfort me is You 
 So I close my eyes 
 And bend my knees 
 And call on You 
 To rescue me 
 Your love 
 Is just a prayer away 
 And Your love is all I need 
 To face another day 
 And when someone takes a moment 
 Just to show they care 
 Oh, I know You are reaching out 
 To help me from there 
 Your love 
 Is just a prayer away 
 Your love is all I need 
 To face another day 
 Oh, all I need 
 To face another day 
 Yeah

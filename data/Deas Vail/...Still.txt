The collapse of the world on the quietest day 
 This time it's the sun standing still 
 But holding on hope for something that's good 
 I've come now as far as I can go today 
 In this vast empty space 
 But don't give up now 
 Don't give up now, No 
 Don't throw your heart away 
 Don't give up now 
 Don't give up now, No 
 Don't throw your heart away 
 The collapse of the world on the quietest day 
 This time it's the sun standing still

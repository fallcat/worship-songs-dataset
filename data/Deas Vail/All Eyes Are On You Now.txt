You think you've covered all your bases, 
 You're hiding all the ugly places, 
 The ones you can't let others see 
 We can see you're more than able, 
 If you can find a place that's stable. 
 We're simply here to help you understand. 
 But the heart you have is good enough, 
 So focus on the ones you love. 
 If you pull yourself together, you'll be fine. 
 You were optimistic, 
 But then you couldn't fix it. 
 All eyes are on you now. 
 Show us what you're made of, 
 What you are afraid of. 
 All eyes are on you now. 
 You're doing the best you can, 
 Everyone is understanding. 
 But you can't take it all upon yourself. 
 And you were optimistic, 
 But then you couldn't fix it. 
 All eyes are on you now. 
 Show us what you're made of, 
 What you are afraid of. 
 All eyes are on you now. 
 'Cause when feelings move to words you say, 
 It's oh that self would fade away. 
 But it's always been and always will go on. 
 And You were optimistic, 
 But then they tried to fix it. 
 All eyes are on you now. 
 Show us what you're made of, 
 What you are afraid of. 
 All eyes are on you now. 
 If they could just admit it, 
 Your honesty would end this. 
 All eyes are on you now.

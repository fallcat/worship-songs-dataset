I'm only a seed in your hand 
 Ill never be big enough 
 But the smallest of parts in your plan 
 Is bigger than anything I know 
 So I give you all I am 
 And you poured out your heart over me and you'd do it again 
 And again 
 So I sigh with my burden 
 And you play me songs of nurture 
 And you say I'm the lucky one 
 And I don't see everything I'm should 
 So I give you all I am 
 And I won't be afraid of mistakes that I've made 
 'Cause I know you understand 
 And every time I come around to this place 
 I can see my self thinking of jumping the spaces 
 Between loving hearts but I never make it 
 So I fall to the bottom and reach up my hands 
 To the lord of forgiveness of this mortal man 
 I'm the king of confessions 
 But I promise that's not in my plan 
 Not in my plan 
 Oh but I'm trying to go on 
 In breaking through walls that don't belong, yeah 
 Putting this back on the shelf 
 And turning away for good this time

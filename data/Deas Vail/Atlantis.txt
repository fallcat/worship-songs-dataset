Stuck in a world of water and glass-- 
 Of recycled air and years that have passed. 
 No one's going to find us here. 
 They don't know to look. 
 No rescue is coming. 
 No one's going to find us here. 
 They don't know to look. 
 No rescue is coming. 
 We took away to make our homes. 
 Now nothing remains 
 From all of our hunger. 
 We gave into our need to own, 
 So the tide in its rage 
 Has taken us under. 
 We are waiting to be found 
 At the bottom of the earth, 
 And frequently we'll send a melody. 
 To the surface of the womb, 
 Where our hope of notice looms. 
 From the perfect place for all humanity-- 
 In the valley of the deep. 
 Death is a stranger 
 With tricks up his sleeves 
 That we'll always need 
 But we'll never receive. 
 No one's going to find us here. 
 They don't know to look. 
 No rescue is coming. 
 No one's going to find us here. 
 They don't know to look. 
 No rescue is coming. 
 We are waiting to be found 
 At the bottom of the earth, 
 And frequently we'll send a melody. 
 To the surface of the womb, 
 Where our hope of notice looms. 
 From the perfect place for all humanity-- 
 From the valley of the deep. 
 I wanna see those gardens where I used to pray. 
 Where I watched the sun come up 
 And evening turn to day. 
 Light never seems to find this place. 
 This black is a permanent reminder that... 
 We are waiting to be found 
 At the bottom of the earth. 
 And frequently we'll send a melody. 
 To the surface of the womb, 
 Where our hope of notice looms. 
 From the perfect place for all humanity-- 
 In the valley of the deep.

I am alone in a stranger's bad dream 
 I don't know what any of this means 
 I see the the signals, I feel the world bending 
 In any moment, it's breaking around me 
 Ooh, It's a matter of time 
 What ya gonna do if I step out of line? 
 I'm crossing fingers and hoping life works out 
 I'm crossing rivers, and hoping I don't drown. 
 I see the imitation, I feel the ending 
 Tell me what it means 
 Is my imagination the only meaning? 
 Everyone is over. Everyone is overcome.

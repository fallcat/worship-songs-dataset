When we all move on, we go back to the start. 
 To when there was no wrong, and we could love 
 Without a fear of change, with the courage of kings. 
 With a steady hand will place everything together again. 
 We'll be together again. 
 So let's begin to take this in. 
 You are the balance. 
 You are the fold. 
 You are the sails that bring me home. 
 I'm looking for that clearer water. 
 I'll never be thirsty again. 
 If I could just touch the robe, it could all be over. 
 All of my sorrows could end. 
 This is what I'm waiting for. 
 I know that there's something more on the way. 
 You are the balance. 
 You are the fold. 
 You are the sails that bring me home. 
 You are the balance. 
 You are the fold. 
 You are the sails that bring me home.

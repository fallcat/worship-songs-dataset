This is our true alarms. 
 This is reality. 
 We will do what we can. 
 We are just figurines 
 With a theology 
 That we don't understand. 
 And we can't forget the beginning, 
 When He set our broken wings. 
 Oh, God, how much does it take 
 For us to be loved? 
 For us to be saved? 
 We all are birds 
 Stuck inside our cage, 
 Covered up with praise. 
 And behind our saints 
 We hide our face. 
 Oh, the numbers come. 
 Yeah, they're dialing in. 
 And we can't help but to compare ourselves again. 
 I can't believe in this-- 
 This blue-lipped, lifeless kiss. 
 And we can't see past our thrones. 
 And we fight for life within, 
 But our walls are wearing thin. 
 Oh God, where have we gone? 
 When I'm just one fighting indifference, 
 Does it matter what I say? 
 Oh, God, how much does it take 
 For us to be loved? 
 For us to be saved? 
 We all are birds 
 Stuck inside our cage, 
 Covered up with praise. 
 And behind our saints 
 We hide our face. 
 Oh, the numbers come. 
 Yeah, they're dialing in. 
 And we can't help but to compare ourselves again. 
 It's not that there were ever bad intentions-- 
 It's more that we forgot where to call home. 
 From important things that we don't know to mention, 
 It's the uniform that we put on-- 
 The formula we have for love. 
 Beautiful intentions 
 Formula for love

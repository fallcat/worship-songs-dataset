I can't stand the mechanical breath, 
 And I'm scared I could slowly love you to death. 
 I can never let go. 
 On and on we are counting the formulas. 
 We've become the modern equation, 
 The numbers of hope. 
 And I won't feed us lies here, 
 They're not giving us much time. 
 I'd give anything to make it better, baby. 
 This is something I can't change. 
 Oh, this silence could go on forever. 
 Am I walking with you in your dreams? 
 These metaphors for conditions and phobias-- 
 We'll pretend that we can explain, but we know we don't know. 
 We can't be led by fear, dear. 
 I'd give anything to make it better, baby. 
 This is something I can't change. 
 Oh, this silence could go on forever. 
 Am I walking with you in your dreams tonight? 
 I'd give anything to make it better, baby. 
 This is something I can't change. 
 Oh, this silence could go on forever. 
 Am I walking with you in your dreams? 
 (I'd give anything to make it better, baby.) 
 Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? 
 (This is something I can't change.) 
 Can you show me that you understand? 
 (Oh, this silence could go on forever.) 
 Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? 
 (Am I walking with you in your dreams?) 
 Can you show me that you understand? 
 We thought we had it all figured out, 
 But we don't know the half of it. 
 And somebody will come and save us all. 
 And somebody will come and let us out, 
 Let us out of our cages.

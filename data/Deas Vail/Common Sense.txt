I'm drawing circles in the sand so I'll know where to land. 
 'Cause we're falling in a foreign aircraft and we can't get out in time. 
 I'm sorry dear, if only we had know the sensitivity. 
 The case is closed. Before we knew it we were out of time. 
 I'm reliving the moment when you said you're doing fine. 
 All the while I'm imagining the best days of my life gone by. 
 Ooh, ooh 
 And I'm burning inside, burning inside 
 I'm pouring out, you're filling up. 
 I'm senseless doubt and you're scared of love. 
 Just one more dance with you and I'll watch those minutes fly. 
 Say you wanted to take it further, please say you really tried. 
 Love is always a fiery dragon whose turned its head to take my life. 
 These roses bleed under my feet. But you placed these steps for me. 
 And our progress halts and fades away for common sense. 
 Yes it's all for common sense. 
 Oh it's awful common sense.

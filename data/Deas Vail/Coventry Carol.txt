Lullay, thou little tiny child, 
 By-bye lully, lullay. 
 Lullay, thou little tiny child, 
 By-bye lully, lullay. 
 O sisters too, how may we do 
 For to preserve this day, 
 This poor youngling for whom we sing 
 By-bye lully, lullay. 
 Herod the king, in his raging, 
 Charged he hath this day; 
 His men of might, in his own sight, 
 All children young, to slay. 
 Then woe is me, poor child, for thee, 
 And ever mourn and say; 
 For thy parting nor say nor sing, 
 By-bye lully, lullay

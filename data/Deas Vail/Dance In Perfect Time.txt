It's a comfortable sound, 
 The passing cars that calm our bodies down. 
 In this little town, 
 We'll fade into summer's new background. 
 So we'll take this cup tonight, 
 This chosen life, 
 We'll dance and dance in perfect time. 
 Our hiding dreams 
 Are silhouettes that take us in our sleep. 
 So if what we have is real, 
 How should this feel? 
 Just dance and dance. 
 Tell me, tell me, can you tell me 
 That the page will turn itself 
 And take us somewhere else? 
 Tell me, tell me, can you tell me 
 That the page will turn itself 
 And take us somewhere else? 
 Tell me, tell me, can you tell me 
 That the page will turn itself 
 And take us somewhere else? 
 Tell me, tell me, can you tell me 
 That the page will turn itself 
 And take us somewhere else? 
 It's a turning key. 
 When two are one, they set each other free.

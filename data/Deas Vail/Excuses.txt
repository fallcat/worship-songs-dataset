Bring yourself and no one else. 
 You come alone or don't come at all. 
 This is your chance to believe in 
 Something more than walls and ceilings. 
 You're saving face to be on your way, yeah. 
 Come on, come on, 
 Don't wait until the damage is done. 
 It's gone when it's gone-- 
 Don't you want to know what we could become? 
 On and on we run and we run from life. 
 It's time we chased the smoke of our guns 
 And we made this right. 
 Save yourself, now don't be scared. 
 I'll do my part and be right there. 
 I will probably come out running, 
 With exploding buildings right behind me. 
 Come on, come on, 
 Don't wait until the damage is done. 
 It's gone when it's gone-- 
 Don't you want to know what we could become? 
 On and on we run and we run from life. 
 It's time we chased the smoke of our guns 
 And we made this right. 
 Come on, come on, 
 Don't wait until the damage is done. 
 It's gone when it's gone-- 
 Don't you want to know what we could become? 
 Come on, come on, 
 Don't wait until the damage is done. 
 It's gone when it's gone-- 
 Don't you want to know what we could become? 
 On and on we run and we run from life. 
 It's time we chased the smoke of our guns 
 And we made this right.

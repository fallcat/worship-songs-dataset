Follow sound. 
 Highway travel underground to find your soul. 
 And you give a lot. 
 But they don't see you for the life you give alone. So go alone. 
 Are you searching cold? You're willing to be more than bold for open doors. 
 But do they pour this on? Well they are fooling no one, now is your chance to let this go. So let this go. 
 And I fell asleep. 
 But no one said anything to me. 
 So I never knew. 
 That you were lost, wondering this world without a chance of getting through. 
 Is this just a game we play together. 
 Do you think we'll ever know. 
 If the pro's and con's allow for us losing hope. 
 You move in slow and steady motion but you're evading none the less. 
 You know their lives are defined by portions of progress. 
 And I fell asleep. 
 But I could dream that I was anything. 
 And we brought ourselves to this place and turned and walked away to find a life that's so much more. 
 You can say anything to me (repeated) 
 Won't you open up your eyes. 
 Through your window you'll see. 
 The sun is shining bright and I promise there's a world out there

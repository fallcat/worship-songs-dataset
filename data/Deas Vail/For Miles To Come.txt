Taken from the deep 
 From the corners of our hollow memories 
 Bringing us to who we are 
 Coming endlessly, we are lost in imagery 
 You're teaching us to see all the places left behind 
 We're taking our time with this 
 While you're calling to sort out our weaknesses 
 We're putting in lives in this 
 Falling over ourselves till it all makes sense 
 Can you see our thought 
 Do you turn your head again? 
 We're so alone and lost 
 Reaching for our innocence 
 Have we always been going out or coming in? 
 And will we see this end? 
 Will you remember everyone? 
 We're taking our time with this 
 While you're calling to sort out our weaknesses 
 We're putting our lives in this 
 Falling over ourselves till it all makes sense 
 We're taking our time with this 
 While you're calling to sort out our weaknesses 
 We're putting our lives in this 
 Falling over ourselves till it all makes sense 
 We were so far gone from the place where we belong 
 But now we're going strong 
 Don't you know we had this all along?

So we'll settle our scores 
 And go our own ways 
 And we're changing our course 
 And playing it safe 
 So this is the end 
 And everything's been turned over 
 I guess we'll begin all over again 
 I'm not coming back 
 It's all your fault 
 We loved ourselves and lost it all 
 What have we done 
 What have we become 
 To open your eyes 
 And come back around 
 Or get on with your life 
 With your head in the clouds 
 It's all for the best 
 Is that just what we tell ourselves 
 We still have our days 
 When will they end 
 You're not coming back 
 It's all my fault 
 We loved ourselves and lost it all 
 What have we done 
 What have we become 
 We're not coming back 
 It's all our fault 
 We loved ourselves and lost it all 
 What have we done 
 What have we become 
 We become 
 We become

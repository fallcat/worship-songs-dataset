God rest ye merry, gentlemen 
 Let nothing you dismay 
 Remember, Christ, our saviour 
 Was born on christmas day 
 To save us all from Satan's power 
 When we were gone astray 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, 
 Comfort and joy 
 O tidings of comfort and joy 
 From god our heavenly father 
 A blessed angel came; 
 And unto certain shepherds 
 Brought tidings of the same: 
 How that in bethlehem was born 
 The son of god by name. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, 
 Comfort and joy 
 O tidings of comfort and joy 
 "Fear not," said the angel, 
 "Let nothing you affright, 
 This day is born a saviour 
 Of pure or virgin bright, 
 To free all those who trust in him 
 From Satan's power and might." 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, 
 Comfort and joy 
 O tidings of comfort and joy 
 Now to the lord sing praises, 
 All you within this place, 
 And with true love and brotherhood 
 Each other now embrace; 
 This holy tide of christmas 
 All other doth deface. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, 
 Comfort and joy 
 O tidings of comfort and joy

Pouring out the judgement from my eyes 
 I'm pulling all the pride from my mind 
 I'm finding all the pieces of my life 
 When I didn't do things even close to right 
 Digging out the deep thorns from my hands 
 And trying not to hide my wounds again 
 You don't ever let me let you down 
 Because this isn't all about me now 
 You keep sending letters 
 Trying to make it better 
 Gone gone gone gone 
 I'm the one who did you 
 Wrong wrong wrong wrong 
 And you couldn't help but love me 
 Even if I was that bad 
 I don't want to start all over again 
 I think it's time to see that this cycle ends 
 Looking from the point where I come from 
 I can finally understand what I've done 
 Gone gone gone gone 
 I'm the one who did you 
 Wrong wrong wrong wrong 
 And you couldn't help but love me 
 Even if I was that bad 
 Take take take take 
 I deserve to fall and 
 Break break break 
 Say anything that would destroy me 
 But you didn't give me that, 
 I fell off the tight rope and into the fires 
 I'm fortunate enough to be your desire again 
 Come easy, so easy 
 You followed me down in the darkness of me 
 And you brought me out of it 
 You taught me the love of a friend 
 So heavy, so heavy 
 Gone gone gone gone 
 I'm the one who did you 
 Wrong wrong wrong wrong 
 And you couldn't help but love me 
 Even if I was that bad 
 Take take take take 
 I deserve to fall and 
 Break break break 
 Say anything that would destroy me 
 But you didn't give me that, 
 You didn't give me

What's a name 
 When in the darkness we all look the same? 
 Holding candles looking for the flame, 
 For the fire to chase the night away 
 As we wait for daylight to break. 
 What is life kept to ourselves? 
 Careful words composed? 
 It's a book upon the shelf, 
 Its story never told. 
 We are frames, 
 Chasing photos of our happier days. 
 Clinging to the ones they can't erase. 
 Going on to find that perfect place, 
 Where we can love each other. 
 We can find each other, 
 We can shape the world again. 
 What is life kept to ourselves? 
 Careful words composed? 
 It's a book upon the shelf, 
 Its story never told. 
 Pages turn and then unfold 
 To show us where we've been. 
 As the signs along the road 
 To lead us home again. 
 I feel like I am turned inside out. 
 I've come so far I can't turn around, 
 But I don't know the next steps to take 
 'Cause all you left were me and the growing pains. 
 What is life kept to ourselves? 
 Careful words composed? 
 It's a book upon the shelf, 
 Its story never told. 
 Pages turn and then unfold 
 To show us where we've been. 
 As the signs along the road 
 To lead us home again.

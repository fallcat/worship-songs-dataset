Maybe it's time for that stage in our lives 
 Let's be honest 
 And more than our pride is our need to survive 
 So let's choose this 
 And the hardest part of letting go 
 Is letting go of our control 
 To fall into place 
 Help me fall into place 
 'Cause I'm just waiting 
 So go for the last place 
 Cause the last place will be the first 
 And let's change our stance 
 We'll stand taller now 
 The air in my lungs fills the voice of my heart 
 It sings of good things 
 So go for the last place 
 Cause the last place will be the first 
 And let's change our stance 
 We'll stand taller now 
 Go for the last place 
 Cause the last place will be the first 
 Let's change our stance 
 We'll stand taller now

We're swirling in and out lanes 
 With our coinciding pains 
 Would you calm down please? 
 And though you say it's not the case 
 We're full of irony and space 
 And you know it 
 But oh you've known it all along 
 You say this constant change in plans 
 Is tossed about in plastic hands 
 Don't you feel that? 
 And though we're out here on our own 
 We're a thousand miles from home 
 We could make it, and we could take this in our hands 
 We could fall between these lines if you would work with me 
 I could pull you from this cellar, we could break these chains together 
 And you'll become just what you were always meant to be 
 From this darkness we're escaping 
 As we're climbing from the belly of the sea 
 And all these battle lines were placed 
 Though their meaning's been erased 
 Into silence 
 And so we stayed and stood our ground 
 Though they were nowhere to be found 
 We were so afraid 
 But we just stood on anyway 
 And we could fall between these lines if you would work with me 
 I could pull you from this cellar, we could break these chains together 
 And you'll become just what you were always meant to be 
 From this darkness we're escaping 
 As we're climbing from the belly of the sea 
 Don't you wait 
 You know that you were made for this 
 Don't you wait 
 You know that you were made for this 
 We could fall between these lines if you would work with me 
 I could pull you from this cellar, we could break these chains together 
 And you'll become just what you were always meant to be 
 From this darkness we're escaping 
 As we're climbing from the belly of the sea

You're sinking in this and you don't know 
 Where to go as the darkness unfolds. 
 Nobody see its, when you're alone 
 And all you know is that you want to start again. 
 We're taking action, do you believe in what you need? 
 That we will find this story's end. 
 If you are burdened, I am as light as air. 
 Take flight. I can carry you there. 
 Broken and blinded, there is a plan, so take my hand. 
 You'll understand this in the end. 
 You can't believe in everything you're told. 
 Sometimes it's nobody that wins, 
 But you fall down for your heart 
 And fight it out until the bitter end. 
 The time is over for silent years of stored up fears 
 That are holding you down. 
 A taken lover that you'll begin to find again 
 It's a hold inside your heart 
 You're coming around now. 
 You want to get older, 
 But don't forget how to stay alive. 
 You're coming around now. 
 You want to get older, 
 But don't forget how to stay alive. 
 You're coming around now. 
 You want to get older, 
 But don't forget how to stay alive. 
 You're coming around now. 
 You want to get older, 
 But don't forget how to stay alive.

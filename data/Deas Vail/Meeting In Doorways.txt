Our time is almost lost 
 In any moment, when our fortunes are our costs, what will remain? 
 We will step into that fate and let it take us. 
 What if sorrow fades away if we can wait? 
 Ooh, letting you go... oh, oh, oh 
 Ooh, only to know... oh, oh, oh 
 Love's an unpredictable ghost... oh, oh, oh 
 Sometimes gone the day you need it the most... oh, oh, oh 
 Your leaves are falling dear. Our season's over. 
 I will wait for one more year when leaves will fall again. 
 Till then your memory comes and goes. That slow reminder, 
 That my eyes will finally close and not come back again. 
 I'm tossed about, I'll sail into the storm 
 If I've lost you now, these waves will carry me on.

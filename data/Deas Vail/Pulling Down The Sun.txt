I close my eyes and I'm pulling down the sun. 
 Into my head where it burns me from the inside out 
 I melt away I don't know what I've become 
 I'm so afraid that I will never find the open arms of love. 
 Why can't I forget the words you, seem to forget not to say. 
 Oh, oh, oh... how did I become the one that's fallen? 
 Now everything I know is a version of what was... 
 Covered underneath the snow. 
 You have forgotten me and left me hopeless 
 Becoming what I know. I don't want to be all alone. 
 Not this again, with your cumulus demands. 
 It never ends, are you failing me again? 
 I'm fading away in the dark. 
 Children on their knees 
 Stolen from their homes and mothers 
 Lost among the weeds 
 They will never sing again

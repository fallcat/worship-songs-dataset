Everyone's careful. 
 They're plotting their best escapes 
 For fear of this whole place burning down. 
 Puzzles and pieces. 
 We're tangled in cages, 
 And they rattle and shake their bones. 
 But they grew from the earth, I watched them bloom. 
 They came up and grabbed me. 
 So stand in a world that seems to be built 
 On pillars and numbers, 
 Or dance with the hopes of falling in love 
 Before we have learned to love ourselves. 
 Measures and objects. 
 They fall in our view of worth, 
 And we're whittled away by zeroes won. 
 Somebody save us. 
 And nobody asks this, 
 But where does our heart live on? 
 In dreaming of dangers, dream of God. 
 And maybe we've got it. 
 So stand in a world that seems to be built 
 On pillars and numbers, 
 Or dance with the hopes of falling in love 
 Before we have learned just to... 
 Stand in a world that seems to be built 
 On pillars and numbers, 
 Or dance with the hopes of falling in love. 
 But how can we love 
 If we can't love ourselves? 
 Can't love ourselves...

Focus on the background 
 Focus on the truth 
 Waiting for the signals 
 Wait, nobody move 
 Give it just a moment 
 Listen to the silence 
 There's a paralyzing quiet like sirens 
 You can forget, leave him here like this 
 I don't want to stand here 
 Don't you understand it's feeding on fear 
 Caught red-handed 
 Gotta get everybody out right now 
 Breathe until it's over 
 Maybe make it through 
 Like water through my fingers 
 There's nothing I can do 
 Give it just a moment 
 Listen to the silence 
 There's a paralyzing quiet like sirens 
 You can forget, leave him here like this 
 I don't want to stand here 
 Don't you understand it's feeding on fear 
 Caught red-handed 
 Gotta get everybody out right now 
 Give it just a moment 
 Listen to the silence 
 There's a paralyzing quiet like sirens 
 You can forget, leave him here like this 
 I don't want to stand here 
 Don't you understand it's feeding on fear 
 Caught red-handed 
 Gotta get everybody out right now

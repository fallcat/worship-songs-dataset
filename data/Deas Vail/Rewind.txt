I promise you we'll be fine now... 
 Just wait until the morning light. 
 Ghosts will come in these night hours, 
 But they're forgotten when the sun comes up. 
 I've watched my life through windows. 
 I've watched my life through windows. 
 This is how it feels 
 To break up sound waves and fall into a quiet place. 
 This is how it feels to stay the same and leave your side. 
 This is how it feels 
 To break up sound waves and fall into a quiet place. 
 This is how it feels to stay the same and leave your side. 
 This behaves like a bad dream, 
 Where we go walking in the dark, 
 And heavenly are these bright lights. 
 They're keeping me awake, and I can't close my eyes as daylight turns to night. 
 This is how it feels 
 To break up sound waves and fall into a quiet place. 
 This is how it feels to stay the same and leave your side. 
 This is how it feels 
 To break up sound waves and fall into a quiet place. 
 This is how it feels to stay the same, stay the same 
 To stay the same

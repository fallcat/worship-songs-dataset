Downwards we operate 
 And I go all to pieces. 
 For just once you imitate someone who is loving, 
 And I am scared of you. 
 Always you come around 
 Saying that you're sorry. 
 Take away this awful sound 
 That I cannot belong to. 
 So now I'm through with you. 
 And we owe this to ourselves 
 To say what we really mean. 
 Honestly, I can't see how this could end happily. 
 I can run to no one else, 
 And I can't stand the thought of this. 
 The ground beneath me breaking, 
 And I'm falling helpless. 
 Touching to make it work 
 When we know this is useless. 
 We're holding back for fear of hurt. 
 We were making no sense, 
 'Cause I'm no good for you. 
 All we need are wounds we can mend 
 For the chance that we can pretend again. 
 All you need is to see an end, 
 To tell me we can make the world turn again. 
 And we owe this to ourselves 
 To say what we really mean. 
 Honestly, I can't see how this could end happily. 
 I can run to no one else, 
 And I can't stand the thought of this. 
 The ground beneath me breaking, 
 And I'm falling helpless

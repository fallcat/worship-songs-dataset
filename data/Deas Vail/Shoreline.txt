So you say I'm better off here 
 As dry as the shoreline 
 In an ocean of fear 
 So you say I can't be alive 
 Until there is nothing 
 When we're meeting eyes again 
 Day by day, I wander these halls 
 And you're casting a shadow 
 Onto every wall 
 But all the way you ring in my ear 
 From the moment I knew you were leaving me here. 
 You're leaving me here. 
 This give and take, 
 This waiting on time 
 It's this twisted up memory that I can't unwind 
 These fragile words that fall from my mouth 
 I'm crumbling and crowded 
 But I've figured you out 
 I've figured you out 
 The shoreline calls the sea 
 For simple words and company 
 But words go on and on 
 Till they collide and all is gone. 
 I dive into the deep 
 Into the sea inside of me 
 To find another song 
 To find a place where I belong

Just twenty-one and it feels like sixteen 
 It's the moment of my life, I'm lost in a feeling 
 It's the season of discovering our best habits 
 I'm searching for a reason to share my secrets 
 And we're lost and we want to be found 
 We'll build it a kiss at a time and it might not fall down 
 Love is taking what we have, baby, don't let go now 
 Remember that it's hard because it's worthwhile 
 Loving isn't always an open doorway 
 It's giving up your heart in moments of faith 
 And we're lost and we want to be found 
 We'll build it a kiss at a time and it might not fall down 
 Love is in the hands that reach out 
 Baby, don't waste this chance, 'cause it might not come back, come back around 
 All this growing up 
 Lately I feel like I've had enough 
 Love is where we turn to get us through 
 I will always turn and follow you 
 Because we're lost and we want to be found 
 We'll build it a kiss at a time and it might not fall down 
 Love is in the hands that reach out 
 Baby, don't waste this chance, 'cause it might not come back, come back around

Better days are held in a photograph 
 Of summer escapes, daydreams and tourist traps 
 Take me back 
 I was never alone to carry the melody 
 It was never my own, it was always a part of me 
 Everything I need 
 You said the words and you didn't even speak 
 Baby let, let me down easy 
 I see the tide, it's coming to get me 
 I don't know who you wanted me to be 
 I gave a lot, but never what you need 
 Winter comes and summer forgets me 
 I know your face in millions of different ways 
 There's no escape from the memories of warmer days 
 Ones I won't erase 
 You said the words and you didn't even speak 
 Baby let, let me down easy 
 I see the tide, it's coming to get me 
 I don't know who you wanted me to be 
 I gave a lot, but never what you need 
 Winter comes and summer forgets me 
 Blind from the flash I'm frozen in time 
 Everything was perfect, everything was right 
 Now I'm lost in the world, all the colors seem wrong 
 Give it just a moment, just a moment 
 You said the words and you didn't even speak 
 Baby let, let me down easy 
 I see the tide, it's coming to get me 
 I don't know who you wanted me to be 
 I gave a lot, but never what you need 
 Winter comes and summer forgets me 
 Summer days are held in a photograph 
 It's never the same, we can't go back

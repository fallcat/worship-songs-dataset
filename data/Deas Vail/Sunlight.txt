Somedays come and somedays go, 
 Where do they get off running out on me? 
 They're running to their symbols. 
 We can't break up, can't break up 
 With ourselves. I wanna, I wanna break through. 
 I wish it were so simple. 
 And underneath the colors of our skins, 
 We are the same. We all began 
 When everything was little. 
 We want more than we can get. 
 Isn't that the way we all like to live-- 
 Without reservations? 
 Sunlight is falling again, 
 But it never touches us 
 Because we cover our eyes and cover our fragile skin, 
 And we are comfortable with this. 
 Elevate the product of our sins. 
 We are the soul of modern trends. 
 Or just the immitations? 
 Sunlight is falling again, 
 But it never touches us 
 Because we cover our eyes and cover our fragile skin, 
 And we are comfortable with this. 
 We can't forget what we came here with 
 And what we'll have left when we leave. 
 And here we stand, with our key in hand. 
 With the ones who stood the closest 
 Slowly falling out of focus. 
 We can't forget what we came here with 
 And what we'll have left when we leave. 
 So here we stand, with our key in hand. 
 And the ones who stood the closest 
 Slowly falling out of focus. 
 Sunlight is falling again, 
 But it never touches us 
 Because we cover our eyes and cover our fragile skin, 
 And we are comfortable with this. 
 How can we hide ourselves like this? 
 It doesn't seem like we all know where we belong. 
 Where we belong. 
 Where we belong...

Come away for evermore. 
 We could place everyone on the floor. 
 We could love them as our own, 
 But we watch from above all alone. 
 All our lives, 
 We put them out of sight and out of mind. 
 But it goes to the bone, 
 So put your shoes back on, We're going home. 
 We're going. 
 Put away our dirty face. 
 Smile away tired eyes we replace. 
 What have we done? 
 Can we see? 
 Everyone watching as we recede. 
 All our lives, 
 We put them out of sight and out of mind. 
 But it goes to the bone, 
 So put your shoes back on, We're going home. 
 We realize our faults and cover up our eyes. 
 Our moment's over. 
 To the sound of nervous glances, 
 We will chance these final dances. 
 We realize our faults and cover up our eyes. 
 Our moment's over. 
 To the sound of nervous glances, 
 We will chance these final dances.

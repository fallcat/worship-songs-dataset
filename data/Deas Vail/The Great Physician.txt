Hello, I have come from the fallen. 
 With colors running down 
 Through the outlines. 
 I've closed my eyes to see 
 What is hidden. 
 But now I play the fool 
 For the last time. 
 Take all of my pain, 
 Or is it just a premonition? 
 I can feel it take my breath away. 
 How can it be that we're saved 
 Just to live with such shame? 
 It's all in my head. 
 So follow 
 And hope will be there if you listen. 
 Take your place 
 Under the hands of the Great Physician. 
 The Great Physician. 
 Move on-- 
 Just move on. 
 Well, I wish it were that easy. 
 I let it go and take it back again. 
 The stones that fall out of my hands 
 Only prove my mistake. 
 Follow 
 And hope will be there if you listen. 
 So take your place 
 Under the hands of the Great Physician. 
 Blinded, 
 Pride is a permanent color. 
 So we're moving on 
 To grow from the stones of a surface lover. 
 We're going under!

I'm telling you, son, 
 It's been a long time coming. 
 I don't want to take 
 Anything away from you. 
 It'll just be a little while 
 If that's alright. 
 How can I place 
 Every piece together 
 When I don't want to face 
 All the things I put you through? 
 If you can't see me in this way, 
 Well, that's alright. 
 So I'll leap from the edge 
 Knowing nothing of the fall. 
 How much time do we have 
 Before the end? 
 As the world rushes in, 
 I'm compelled to look back home. 
 And I'm finally conscious of 
 How this began. 
 The beginning of a lifetime 
 In the chains of the leaper's end. 
 I cover my face, 
 And I swear I won't go 
 For another taste. 
 It's the poison in my mouth. 
 And I think if I don't go back, 
 I can't go wrong. 
 So I'll leap from the edge 
 Knowing nothing of the fall. 
 How much time do we have 
 Before the end? 
 As the world rushes in, 
 I'm compelled to look back home. 
 And I'm finally conscious of 
 How this began. 
 The beginning of a lifetime 
 In the chains of the leaper's end. 
 So I'll leap from the edge 
 Knowing nothing of the fall. 
 How much time do we have 
 Before the end? 
 As the world rushes in, 
 I'm compelled to look back home. 
 And I'm finally conscious of 
 How this began. 
 The beginning of a lifetime 
 In the chains of the leaper's end.

I wasn't afraid, until the day I saw you that way. 
 You're falling apart wondering how many second chances there are. 
 Grace, it doesn't work that way, and faith is not a step we take. 
 Here's our chance, we can fall in love again. 
 It won't have to be that way. 
 We can run from the lies we're living in. 
 And make all the right mistakes. 
 Come away. 
 Your choice is the same, but every time you make it you change. 
 If you give I will take, all the little failures away. 
 You're in the middle of a nightmare but you will never be alone there. 
 I just want you to know what healing is. 
 If you want we can start all over again.

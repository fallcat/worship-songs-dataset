It's making perfect sense 
 Why I'm putting this one off. 
 I'm going to take that second chance, 
 Before the day is done. 
 I think to myself: maybe this is love, 
 And maybe it's something else.

 Until you came and saved me. 
 This is not what it seems.

 And given me new life, yeah. 
 I turned every light on 
 But I still can't find my way. 
 And I forget this, what is love? 
 Well, today could remind me. 
 You were ordinary, oh 
 Until you came and saved me. 
 This is not what it seems. 
 No, you've taken me by surprise 
 And given me new life, yeah.

 It's something to live for... 
 It's something to live for... 
 It's something to live for... 
 It's something to live for... 
 You were ordinary, oh 
 Until you came and saved me. 
 This is not what it seems. 
 No, you've taken me by surprise 
 And given me new life, yeah. 
 Given me new life, yeah. 
 Given me new life...

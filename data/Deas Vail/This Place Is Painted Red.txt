I get up and I walk away. 
 I swear I won't get caught in this mold. 
 I live in sacred days. 
 What's the point if I'm reconciling past postitions. 
 I am so naïve. I am so naïve. 
 Put the pressure on. 
 I'm only human but I'll do this if you will speak through me. 
 Take me to that place. 
 I was a boy there. 
 I was so alive but now I am lost in life. 
 So my friend you tell me over and over. 
 And I said again. 
 Why won't you open up? 
 I want to be held again as the walls are falling down. 
 'Cause I forget what it was like before you were asleep there underground. 
 Give me back my life I am so weary. 
 I am barely breathing. 
 When can we sail away. 
 If you're the open skies then I am the ocean and horizons make the place we can meet again. 
 Why won't you open up? 
 I want to be held again as the walls are falling down. 
 'Cause I forget what it was like before you were asleep there underground. 
 We were so lost

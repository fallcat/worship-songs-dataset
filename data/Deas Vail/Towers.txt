Our towers are all tall 
 They reach out into the sunlight 
 Like the arms from far below 
 They appear from worlds of endless night 
 I may never see the sun 
 While I'm lost within the shadows 
 Because our towers have become 
 The divorce of any love we know 
 Our friends become our foes 
 We'll stand together, together 
 Tear our devils down 
 And they will fall like feathers 
 Like feathers slowly to the ground 
 I can only see the stars 
 In the reflections on the windows 
 Of the walls the tower far 
 In all directions like a curtain closed 
 With nowhere left to go

You've seen the stars 
 Here's your troubles ending 
 A million miles from here 
 Will they disappear 
 A galaxy of excuses far away 
 The frequencies of our little towers 
 A rusty sound reminding us to pray 
 Will you tell me if it really matters 
 So take your bags 
 But leave your things behind 
 Cause this is never over 
 Going undercover 
 Said you were another 
 Why don't you just let me down 
 When you're in your positions 
 I don't see inhibitions 
 The time has come to let your demons out 
 We broke down and we broke up running 
 Oh my God, our chance has passed away 
 It's boring down to the changes in our hearts 
 So take your bags 
 But leave your things behind 
 Cause this is never over 
 So tell me what were you really looking for 
 Going undercover 
 Said you were another 
 Why don't you just let me down 
 When you're in your positions 
 I don't see inhibitions 
 The time has come to let your demons out

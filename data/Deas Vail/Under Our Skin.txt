Running faster than light I can't forget why I'm trying 
 And asking questions that matter it's getting harder each time 
 I can see I wanted to forget what went wrong 
 We both know this is just under our skin, under our skin 
 We can make it if we just pretended, never listened 
 If we stand in the middle can we just take our time 
 Will you give me your best days, 'cause I'm giving you mine 
 And I'll become the one to repair you, wait and see 
 We both know this is just under our skin, under our skin 
 We can make it if we just pretended, never listened 
 We can make it matter, here is a terrible honest start 
 Working out all our problems, it doesn't make it disappear 
 Complicates it, and what more there is a blame apart 
 We both know this is just under our skin, under our skin 
 We can make it if we just pretended, never listened 
 We both know this is just under our skin, under our skin 
 We can make it if we just pretended, never listened

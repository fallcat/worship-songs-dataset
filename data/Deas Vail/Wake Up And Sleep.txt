Why don't you know what you want? 
 Or have you given it thought? 
 We're in a sad sad situation 
 You're looking for what you already got 
 All this waiting around 
 For you to figure this out 
 I am a world of good temptation 
 Looking for you to come back around 
 Are you waking up just to fall asleep again? 
 Have you had enough? Come and take my hand. Won't you tell me... 
 Is it really love? If I take what I can get, then I've given up 
 Baby hold my hand, hold my hand 
 I'm not playing your games 
 They only get in our way 
 I set a course for intervention 
 'Cause I have seen more than I can take 
 I'm not taking any chances

She's dropping breadcrumbs to show where she's been 
 To a house made of candy, of sorrow, of sin 
 And she hopes it's alright that she quietly let herself in 
 This is is her addition, this is her fame 
 This is the place where she deals with the pain 
 And sometimes the stars in her sky hold against the rain 
 Echoes coming back 
 (What's this?) 
 Hit or miss attack 
 (You missed it) 
 She's got white lights on her face 
 From the bad days that she just can't erase 
 Now she's forgiving the harms of her past 
 She'll take a message somewhere it will last 
 And she fails where she fails but she's trying, and growing up fast 
 Echoes coming back 
 (What's this?) 
 Hit or miss attack 
 (You missed it) 
 She's got white lights on her face 
 From the bad days that she just can't erase 
 And her sad eyes are replaced 
 With the new life in a beautiful place 
 And this is the pattern 
 And this is the stone 
 This is the past she knows she can't run from 
 This is the place she's been in since she was born 
 Echoes coming back 
 (What's this?) 
 Hit or miss attack 
 (You missed it) 
 She's got white lights on her face 
 From the bad days that she just can't erase 
 I can tell by the light in her eyes that she can see 
 (And walk away) 
 From the people and places and things she used to be 
 'Cause she's got white lights on her face 
 From the bad days that she just can't erase 
 And her sad eyes are replaced 
 With the new life in a beautiful place

Listen here 
 Now you made the world and all of its beauty, 
 Separated the land from the sea, yeah 
 And you set the sun and put the stars in place, 
 And you did it all in 7 days yeah, oh 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa ooh whoa, 
 U did it all in 7 Days [x2] 
 Listen and who turned up and, and made somethin' 
 Out of a dirty little wreach like me, woo 
 Oh it's your mercy and your grace, 
 That covers me 7 days 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa ooh whoa, 
 U did it all in 7 Days (Until song goes off)

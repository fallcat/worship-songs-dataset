Gotta tell ya I'm so in a daze 
 Floating with the clouds, the highest clouds 
 Feels like heaven when I think of you 
 I stand amazed, so mesmerized 
 Words can't describe what I'm trying to say 
 You're always on my mind, seven days of the week 
 Even when I'm asleep, I'm constantly dreaming of You 
 It happens every time I fall to my knees 
 Your sweet name makes me weak, I'm constantly dreaming of You 
 When I feel your love, I'm so alive 
 Get butterflies, feels good inside 
 I'm on cloud 9, no one else can do 
 Amazing you, I want to tell the whole world 
 Like a flower full in bloom from the sunshine 
 So beautiful, only you can make me feel the way 
 I'm feeling right now like an autumn leaf I'm falling 
 So in love, only you make me feel this way 
 You're always on my mind, seven days of the week 
 Even when I'm asleep, I'm constantly dreaming of you 
 It happens every time I fall to my knees 
 Your sweet name makes me weak, I'm constantly dreaming of You 
 You're always on my mind, seven days of the week 
 Even when I'm asleep, I'm constantly dreaming of you 
 It happens every time I fall to my knees 
 Your sweet name makes me weak, I'm constantly dreaming of You 
 You give me peace of mind 
 Without you I'm lost 
 And thank you for your sweet love 
 It feels so good, please don't ever leave me 
 Like a flower full in bloom from the sunshine 
 So beautiful, only you can make me feel the way 
 I'm feeling right now like an autumn leaf I'm falling 
 So in love, only you make me feel this way 
 You're always on my mind, seven days of the week 
 Even when I'm asleep, I'm constantly dreaming of you 
 It happens every time I fall to my knees 
 Your sweet name makes me weak, I'm constantly dreaming of You 
 You're always on my mind, seven days of the week 
 Even when I'm asleep, I'm constantly dreaming of you 
 It happens every time I fall to my knees 
 Your sweet name makes me weak, I'm constantly dreaming of You 
 You're always on my mind, it happens every time 
 I fall to my knees, Your sweet name makes me weak 
 I'm constantly dreaming of you

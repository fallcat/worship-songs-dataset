 I ain't change 
 'Cause I got folks singing my name 
 (Singing my name, yeah) 
 And as a matter fact I had to go through 
 A little more pain 
 (More pain) 
 And as I win one soul 
 I'm doing what God call me to do 
 Um, I do whatever it takes 
 To get the word straight to you

 When people tell me that 
 My music changed their life 
 (Change their life) 
 Said man your music made 
 Me go home to my wife 
 And there were two songs 
 That took me through my greatest test 
 And when I here those testimonies 
 They let me know that I've been blessed 
 (Ooh)

 Oho, oho, ooh 
 Man ain't nothin' changed with the live we save 
 From night to day we give Christ the praise 
 No matter the 'cause we'll carry the cross 
 Those lyrics insane 
 (Yeah) 
 You ready to tell em' how you feelin' 
 It's been a long time coming, I'm here now 
 From the streets to the church I'm all in ya ears now 
 With a whole revolution in gospel music, we've got gospel movin' 
 I'm just the vessel that god been using BJ, tell what god been doing 
 We've been changing up a storm, broken lies and rumors 
 Yeah I'm here to show em' that god really cares 
 That he's already there, I already told he's a sinners prayer 
 So give me a beat and I'll keep on rapping 
 And I'll keep on singing 
 And we'll keep on bringing 
 Like gospels like apostles 
 Just adding tracks so step back 
 I'm here to let you know that 
 Hadd is back come on

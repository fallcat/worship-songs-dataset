spoken: 
 I dedicate this song to all those 
 Who have lost loved ones 
 Along the way. If we hold on 
 We'll gonna see them again after while. 
 How can I forget the times you held my hand 
 And wipe the tears from my eyes 
 How can I forget oh yeah 
 That when I needed someone 
 You were right by my side 
 I know you had to be an angel in the skies 
 Sent from God to bring joy to my life 
 And now you are gone back home 
 And I want you to know 
 I still hear your voice 
 I still feel your touch 
 And when I close my eyes 
 I can see your smile 
 Though you're gone away to a better place 
 I can't wait to be with you 
 After while 
 Ooh after while. 
 Sometimes I break down 
 But I accept God's will 
 In spite of the way I feel 
 Sometimes I wish that I 
 I wish that I 
 I could take your place 
 You should not have gone that way 
 But I know you were an angel in the skies 
 Sent from God 
 To bring joy to my life

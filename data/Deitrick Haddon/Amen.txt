 Romans 8:18 says "For I reckon that the 
 Sufferings of this present time are not worthy to 
 Be compared with the glory which shall be 
 Revealed in us." I ask myself how did He do it, 
 Make such a sacrifice, and the one's that He 
 Loved wanted Him crucified, and He knew that 
 His friends would betray Him, and He knew that 
 His blood would be shed, He could have put 
 Someone else in His place but instead He said 
 "Amen" I surrender, Amen my will is yours, 
 "Amen" I lift my hands and say "Amen", so I 
 Looked at my test and trials they can't compare 
 To his pain, and if he can go through it, surley I 
 Can do the same. Oh Lord, I bless you for all 
 Of the bad, and I bless you for all of the good, 
 And the place where I stand You have already 
 Stood, "Amen" nevertheless "Amen", I don't 
 Understand but "Amen", Lord I surrender, 
 "Amen" my soul say "Amen," this is not about 
 Me Lord, but all about your will, "Amen" 
 'Amen', yeah yeah 
 Lord I trust you with all of my soul, my soul say 
 " Amen" Lord I surrender to your will, and I 
 Surrender to your way, there is nothing else to 
 Say but 'Amen" 
 You can mold me, You can make me, You can 
 Break me. 
 And when trouble comes say "Amen" and when 
 Trouble goes say "Amen" 
 Lord I trust you, with all of my heart and soul. 
 "Amen"

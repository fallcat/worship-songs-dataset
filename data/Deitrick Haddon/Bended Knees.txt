This is serious, oh 
 So serious man, oh 
 We never needed You before, we need You right now 
 Need You right now, oh 
 People are dying, losing the faith 
 Even the chosen have fallen from grace, oh 
 We got the blind leading the blind 
 Lord knows I'm tryin' what I've been assigned, Lord 
 I'll say it all, oh Lord 
 I'm down on my bended knee, yeah 
 (I'm on my bended knees, I'm on my bended knees 
 I'm on my bended knees asking You to help us please) 
 Down on my bended knees, yeah, whoo 
 (I'm on my bended knees, I'm on my bended knees 
 I'm on my bended knees asking You to help us please) 
 I'm praying on bended knees 
 Have mercy, Lord have mercy, oh 
 I said, Lord 
 I'm just tryin' to intercede, yeah 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm standing alone 
 But I know there are soldiers that's still holdin' on 
 Now what we really Lord, is help from up high 
 If You don't have mercy, so many souls will die 
 I'm sayin' oh, oh, yeah 
 I'm on my bended knees, yeah, hey, yeah 
 (I'm on my bended knees, I'm on my bended knees 
 I'm on my bended knees asking you to help us please) 
 I'm on bended knees 
 (I'm on my bended knees, I'm on my bended knees 
 I'm on my bended knees asking you to help us please) 
 Oh, lord, I'm prayin' 
 (I'm praying on bended knees) 
 Somebody's prayin' 
 (Have mercy, Lord have mercy) 
 Oh Lord, I'm just tryin' to intercede, yeah 
 I'm down on my bended knees 
 I'm asking You to have mercy 
 Somebody gotta intercede 
 We need Your help in a hurry 
 Got people in high places with their hands dirty 
 And the world can't get no help 
 Because they're taking all the money 
 I'm rocking in the wilderness 
 Only You can clean up the mess 
 Sin I know you refuse to bless 
 Got to get on my knees and confess 
 Oh Lord, I, I know You see 
 I'm on my, I'm on my bended knees 
 Oh, y'all let me preach 
 Yeah, lower than I've ever been, knees upon a concrete 
 Lord, I'm tryna fight this fight but ain't no one behind me 
 I just need a sound please Lord, it's getting dark here 
 Come just shine a Pentecost so I walk in no fear 
 And make me the hands, and You the only lifeline 
 Church comes in the morning but it's looking like it's May time 
 I'll never let him go, Celine Dion 
 He said, "I'm the light in the darkness", neon 
 And [Incomprehensible] bow way 
 And so bended knees, Lord I begin to pray 
 Yeah, Pray 
 Oh, Lord, I'm on bended knees 
 (I'm on my bended knees, I'm on my bended knees 
 I'm on my bended knees asking You to help us please) 
 Come teach me, for nobody but me 
 (I'm on my bended knees, I'm on my bended knees 
 I'm on my bended knees asking You to help us please) 
 I'm prayin' for a family 
 I'm prayin' for the children

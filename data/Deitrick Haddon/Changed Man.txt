The Things I Used To Do 
 I Don't Do No More 
 'Cause I've Been Changed 
 I'm A Changed Man 
 And The Places I Used To Go 
 I Don't Go No More 
 'Cause I've Been Changed 
 I'm A Changed Man 
 I Know Your Thinking It's Just A Faze 
 You Said I'll Go Back To My Own Ways 
 But I come To Find To Turn Around 
 And I Refuse To Be Bound, I Refuse To Be Bound 
 I've Been Waiting For This Long Time 
 Now I Have A peace Of Mind 
 And Everything Is Gonna Be All right 
 'Cause Jesus Is A Friend Of Mine, A Friend Of Mine 
 The Things I Used To Do 
 I Don't Do No More 
 'Cause I've Been Changed 
 I'm A Changed Man 
 And The Places I Used To Go 
 I Don't Go No More 
 'Cause I've Been Changed 
 I'm A Changed Man 
 No more do I have to search for love 
 Love came after me 
 Now I'm free as I wanna be 
 All I did was believe, All I did was receive 
 Why don't you give this love a try 
 It will open up your blinded eye 
 Come on and let the lord in your life 
 Don't care what people say 
 I'm livin' in a brand new day 
 I may not be what I wanna be 
 But thank God I'm not what I used to be 
 The Things I Used To Do 
 I Don't Do No More 
 I've been changed (till end of song)

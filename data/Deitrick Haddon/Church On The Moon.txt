Today is a celebration 
 When we live to see the church reach new heights 
 We dedicate this new territory 
 To God, we have, lift off 
 There's no gravity between you and me 
 Let's go to a place where there's no time or space 
 And the Holy Spirit has got me so high 
 Ooh, this must be what Heaven is like 
 This earthly atmosphere can't contain me 
 You might as well lift your praise and go with me 
 The only way to explain this to you 
 I'm havin' church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 We all can say we lived to see God do the impossible 
 The church is officially on the moon 
 Yeah, I'm out of this world, moving in the speed of light 
 New territories surrounded by His glory 
 Uplifting me to a place I've never been before 
 Got me flyin' higher than a eagle that ever soars 
 This earthly atmosphere won't restrain me 
 You might as well lift your praise and go with me 
 Only way I can explain it to you 
 I'm havin' church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 From way up here, my problems look so small 
 And I'm not worried, no, God ain't gonna let me fall 
 I got a flag in my hand, I'ma set it down right here 
 And the world will know me and you at church on the moon, yeah 
 We're havin' church, we havin' church on the moon 
 We're havin' church, we havin' church on the moon 
 We're havin' church, we havin' church on the moon 
 We're havin' church, we havin' church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 Church on the moon, Church on the moon 
 We're now all witnesses to the power of God 
 We are astounded of this phenomenon 
 They said that we couldn't do it 
 But our praise has taken us somewhere we've never been before 
 We're havin' church, we're havin' church on the moon 
 We're havin' church, we're havin' church on the moon 
 We're havin' church, we're havin' church on the moon 
 We're havin' church, we're havin' church on the moon

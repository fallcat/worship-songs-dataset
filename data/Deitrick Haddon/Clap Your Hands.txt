Yo, Tim, Yo, Bob 
 We had to do it, man 
 Yeah, we got to praise God 
 While we got the chance 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 When I think of You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 This one's for You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 Excuse me while I praise Him 
 I might look crazy to you 
 But this is the way that I express myself 
 He's the one that saved me 
 From this cruel world that's crazy 
 And now my mind is somewhere else in Him 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 When I think of You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 This one's for You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm a leader by example 
 Got love for all my people 
 And we got to give it up to Him 
 See, this whip that I am driving 
 These clothes that I am rocking and the ice 
 It all belongs to Him, not me 
 You've done so much, much for me 
 I'm gon' clap and move my feet 
 Let them talk about me, it's all good You set me free 
 I'm so blessed just to breathe, walk around and just believe 
 Just look what faith can do for you 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 When I think of You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 This one's for You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 When I think of You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 This one's for You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 Watch me, while I do my dance 
 I'm gonna praise Him while I can 
 I can't sit down on this jam 
 Got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 Thank You for the air I breathe 
 Simple things You set me free 
 Through faith I feel You moving me 
 Got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 Done so much, much for me 
 I'm gone clap and move my feet 
 Let them talk about me, it's all good You set me free 
 I'm so blessed just to breathe, walk around and just believe 
 Just look what faith can do for you 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 When I think of You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 This one's for You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 When I think of You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 This one's for You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 When I think of You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands 
 I'm gonna praise God while I got the chance 
 Watch me while I do my dance 
 This one's for You, got to clap my hands, clap my hands

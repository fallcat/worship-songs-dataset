You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 You gotta name them one by one 
 Baby you can't take the credit 
 For anything that GOD has done 
 I don't know how I made it over 
 I don't know how I made it through 
 You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 And say LORD its because of you 
 I know some folks so caught up in self 
 With their nose up looking down on everybody else 
 But as for me I gotta swallow my pride 
 When I think about my life tears flow from my eyes 
 I can't forget back in Detroit city 
 With my demo tape tryna get folks to her me 
 Tryna bring a new sound to this gospel game 
 Had people hatin' on me in JESUS name 
 And I could have gave up a long time ago 
 If I did you wouldn't hear me on this radio 
 Couldn't come to your city and rock the show 
 I just want the world to know 
 You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 You gotta name them one by one 
 Baby you can't take the credit 
 For anything that GOD has done 
 I don't know how I made it over 
 I don't know how I made it through 
 You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 And say LORD its because of you 
 See you gotta give praise to the most high 
 Its because of him that you can touch the sky 
 It's the little things we should never forget 
 While you're driving bentleys and flyin in jets 
 Who woke you up this morning started you on your way 
 Keeping your heart pumping each and every day 
 Who gave you power to do big things 
 I think we oughta stop and give praise to the King 
 Its okay to want your pockets fatter 
 But we gotta focus on what really matters 
 Like love, life and family 
 Want the world to sing with me 
 You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 You gotta name them one by one 
 Baby you can't take the credit 
 For anything that GOD has done 
 I don't know how I made it over 
 I don't know how I made it through 
 You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 And say LORD its because of you 
 He brought me from a mighty long way 
 He keeps on making a way 
 I gotta roof over my head 
 I'm still alive when I could have been dead 
 Over and over again 
 He keeps forgiving me of my sins 
 When I think about all he's done 
 I gotta testify that you're the one 
 You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 You gotta name them one by one 
 Baby you can't take the credit 
 For anything that GOD has done 
 I don't know how I made it over 
 I don't know how I made it through 
 You gotta sit back and count your blessings 
 And say LORD its because of you 
 He brought me from a mighty long way 
 He keeps on making a way 
 I gotta roof over my head 
 I'm still alive when I could have been dead 
 Over and over again 
 He keeps forgiving me of my sins 
 When I think about all he's done 
 I gotta testify that you're the one

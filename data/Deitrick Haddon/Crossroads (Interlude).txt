Staning at the crossroads of life 
 Somehow I went wrong when I shoulda went right 
 And I can't blame this one on nobody else 
 Come and rescue me from myself 
 I am standing at the crossroad of life 
 Somehow my days have turned into night 
 And if my decisions are the keys 
 To my destiny 
 Come rescue me 
 (Chorus: fade) 
 I'll be standind at the crossroad 
 Till you come and take my hand 
 Lord I need your love 
 To make me a better man 
 I'll be standing at the crossroad 
 Till you come and lead the way 
 I'll be waiting here 
 Till you help me leave and pray

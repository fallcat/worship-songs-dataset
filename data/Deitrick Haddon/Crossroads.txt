(Feat. lady life) 
 Lady life: 
 I'm putting you on the map right (yeah) 
 Yeah it's official 
 Pastor d lady life 
 We back at the crossroads 
 What you gon do 
 Which path are you gon choose 
 Where did you lose your faith 
 And why did you walk away 
 Gained the world 
 Now was it worth your soul? 
 Now you're standing at the crossroads 
 Be the things you gave the world 
 All the benjamins and girls 
 Thought you had everything in your hands 
 But what about the master's plan 
 For the fortune and fame 
 You gave up your faith 
 Now was it worth the sacrifice 
 For you to lose your life 
 Take my hand let me lead the way 
 Let me lead you to a brighter day 
 I know you think nobody knows 
 But you're standing at the crossroads 
 Where did you lose your faith 
 And why did you walk away 
 Gained the world 
 Now was it worth your soul? 
 Now you're standing at the crossroads 
 Walking 'round empty inside 
 From the pain you try to hide 
 Deep down it's misery 
 And you think that he can't see 
 But god understands 
 Won't you take my hand 
 You don't have to hurt no more 
 God is knocking at your door 
 Take my hand let me lead the way 
 Let me lead you to a brighter day 
 I know you think nobody knows 
 But you're standing at the crossroads 
 Rap: 
 Yeah... okay... at some point we all come to these crossroads 
 I'm at these crossroads man 
 Trying to make a decision 
 Contemplating my paths 
 Taking the way that I'm living 
 Steadily repenting 'cause I'm really just trying to stay sved 
 Change my ways 
 Haters wanna send me straight to the grave 
 But I ain't having it 
 I done made up my mind 
 I'm heading for the straight and narrow 
 Steady ready to grind 
 Ready to shine 
 Cause the life is back again 
 Ain't gonna be no sucker for sin 
 When you're down with him 
 Vamp: 
 Lost your faith 
 And you walked away 
 Was it worth your soul 
 Now you're standing at the crossroads

For those who don't know me, I'm 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 When you see hear me on the radio 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 When you see me on TV 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 On the cover of my CD, y'all 
 (Deitrick haddon) 
 But when I'm at home, I'm just D.D. 
 That is what they call me, D.D. 
 My wife need to call me, baby 
 Let me be real, let me be me 
 I'm just a normal guy from da hood 
 Tryin' to get my point across, be understood 
 I would never stop singin', if I could 
 'Cause the God I serve has been too good 
 I just wanna keep it, keep it real 
 'Cause I can't tell you nothin', I don't feel 
 Take this journey with me, for a while 
 We gon' laugh, we gon' cry, we gon' smile 
 Everybody call me, yeah 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 On the cover of a magazine, y'all 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 There's a name that my mama gave me 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 On the cover of my CD, y'all 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 And only all my brothers and sisters say 
 (D.d) 
 And those who know me back in the day 
 (D.d) 
 My Grandmother called me her baby 
 (D.d) 
 And I'm just a real one, let me be me 
 (D.d) 
 I was just a little boy, had a dream 
 That I would sing in the presence of Kings 
 And spread the love of Jesus Christ 
 And watch His power change peoples lives 
 And now that I'm older, nothing's changed 
 My goal is pretty much the same 
 Had to go through some heartaches and pain 
 But now, I'm doin' it in Jesus' name 
 Everybody call me, y'all 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 And when I'm in a concert, y'all 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 And when you see me on TV 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 On the cover of my CD 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 At the end of the chain 
 I'll always be, D.D 
 And my family and friends call me, D.D 
 My Mama still think I'm a baby 
 And I'm a real one, I want you to see 
 The only way I know how to be is myself 
 I don't try to be like somebody else 
 God created all of us to be one of a kind 
 I can't take what's yours and you can't take what's mine 
 Now, through the storm, I will be 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 Through the rain, I will be 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 And through the sickness, I will be 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 And through the pain, I will be 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 And you can't change me 
 (D.d) 
 'Cause I'm just plain old 
 (D.d) 
 My wife don't need to call me 
 (D.d) 
 I'ma real, what I want you to see 
 Everybody call me 
 (D.d) 
 And you can't make me be in 
 (D.d) 
 That's all I give y'all 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 I'm just a humble guy 
 (D.d) 
 Got the love of Jesus in my life 
 (D.d) 
 I'm still 
 (D.d) 
 And I'm the real one, I want you to see, oh 
 (Deitrick Haddon) 
 (D.d, d.d, d.d, d.d, d.d) 
 That's what they call me

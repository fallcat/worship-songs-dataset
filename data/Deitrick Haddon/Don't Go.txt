Don't go, don't go, I love you so 
 Don't go, don't go, I love you so 
 You said don't walk out the door 
 (Don't go, don't go) 
 Slammed that door in your face 
 (I love you so) 
 I took advantage of your love 
 (Don't go, don't go) 
 Now I'm man enough to pay 
 Yeah, won't you take me back? 
 I remember when you said 
 Don't go, don't go 
 And I wanna come home 'cause 
 I love you so 
 I remember when you said 
 Don't go, don't go 
 And I learned my lesson 
 I wanna come home 
 Now every time I think about you 
 (Don't go, don't go) 
 And where I'm at in my life 
 (I love you so) 
 I'm in this position 
 (Don't go, don't go) 
 All because of my pride 
 (Ooh, ooh, whew, hmm) 
 You told me never run away and what did I do, I ran away 
 I found out no one loves you out her in this cold world 
 But now I'm back and begging on bended knees and crying 
 I'm out of tears so I'll say talk me back 
 I remember when you said 
 Don't go, don't go 
 And I wanna come home 'cause 
 I love you so 
 I remember when you said 
 Don't go, don't go 
 And I learned my lesson 
 I wanna come home 
 You told me never run away and what did I do, I ran away 
 I found out no one loves you out her in this cold world 
 But now I'm back and begging on bended knees and crying 
 I'm out of tears so I'll say talk me back 
 I remember when you said 
 Don't go, don't go 
 And I wanna come home 'cause 
 I love you so 
 I remember when you said 
 Don't go, don't go 
 And I learned my lesson 
 I wanna come home 
 Now every time I think about you 
 (Don't go, don't go) 
 And where I'm at in my life

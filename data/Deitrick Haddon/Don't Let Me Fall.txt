When the enemy comes in like a flood, 
 God will lift a standard against him. 
 When my enemies encamp 
 Round about me 
 I will lift my voice unto the lord 
 Lord won't you hear my plea 
 (When I'm down on my knees) 
 Savior won't you hear my cry 
 I surrender all, lord I'm asking you 
 Please don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't left me fall, lord 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't let fall lord 
 As I walk through the valley of decision 
 I'm asking you to take me by the hand 
 Lord I know that I'm so unworthy 
 With your help I can be a better man 
 Lord won't you hear my plea 
 (When I'm down on my knees) 
 Savior won't you hear my cry 
 I surrender all, lord I'm asking you 
 Please don't let me fall 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't left me fall, lord 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't let fall lord 
 Don't let 
 Don't let me fall 
 Don't let 
 Please don't let me fall 
 Hold me up, 
 Don't let me fall 
 Hold me up, 
 Please don't let me fall 
 (Merci Ã  merry pour cettes paroles)

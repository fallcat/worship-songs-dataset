(Oh, oh) 
 I've been without a lot of things 
 And in my mind, I'm questioning 
 And if ever, He will leave my side 
 Don't know how I'll make it, how will I survive 
 (Ay) And in I heard 
 You in my ear, sayin' it's okay, don't worry I am here 
 Don't where I would be today, if you would ever take your love away 
 Don't take your spirit away, your spirit away 
 Your spirit away 
 Don't know how I can make it from day to day 
 Don't take it away. 
 I promise You that I will do it better. 
 I promise I will get myself together. 
 Don't take it. 
 Don't take it. 
 Your spirit away. 
 Now am a man with many dreams. 
 I'm dreaming more for You, so never leave 
 Please won't you stay 
 When me always? 
 There's no one that 
 Can take Your place 
 (Ay) And in I heard 
 You in my ear, sayin' it's okay don't worry I am here 
 Don't where I would be today, if you would ever take your love away 
 Don't take your spirit away, your spirit away 
 Your spirit away. 
 Don't know how I can make it from day to day 
 Don't take it away. 
 I promise You that I will do it better 
 I promise I will get myself together 
 Don't take it. 
 Don't take it. 
 Your spirit away.

 (Don't You leave me!) 
 (I'm couldn't make it!) 
 (Never leave me!) 
 (I couldn't take it!) 
 Don't take it (no!) 
 Don't take it (noho!) 
 Don't take it (no) 
 Your spirit away (Hear my cry!) 
 Don't take it (Ay) 
 Don't take it (don't take it) 
 Don't take it (AY) 
 Your spirit away 
 You can take my name, You can take my fame 
 But ooh, please don't take Your 
 (Your spirit away) 
 You can take my money, You can take it all 
 But please don't take Your 
 (Your spirit away)...

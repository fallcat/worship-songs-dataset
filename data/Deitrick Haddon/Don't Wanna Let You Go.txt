Yes, yes 
 There comes a point in your life 
 When you have to come to grips with yourself 
 And say just like Jacob 
 That 'I won't let go until you bless my soul' 
 N-now it took some time to get to place in your life 
 And I don't know about you but I refuse to allow God's presence to come in and leave without a blessing 
 My, my, my, my 
 And leave without a new anointing 
 You need to say this with me 
 Come on 
 Now that you're here 
 I don't wanna let you go 
 I don't wanna let you go, no 
 I don't wanna let you go 
 No-o Lord 
 Now that you're here 
 I don't wanna let you go-o-o 
 I just can't wanna let you go (Ooh, no) 
 No, no-o-o 
 Now that your presence is here 
 I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna) 
 I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna) 
 I don't wanna let you go (Oh-o-o-oh No) 
 Oh no 
 I'm in love with you Jesus, said I 
 I don't wanna let you go (I-I-I-I-I) 
 I don't wanna let you go (Can you just wait one minute) 
 I don't wanna let you go (Don't go please, no) 
 I'll just stay here 
 In your arms forever (Forever) 
 As the seasons and days go by (Let 'em go by) 
 I'll just stay right here 
 In your presence forever 
 As the seasons (The seasons) 
 And the days (The days) 
 Days go by (Ooh) 
 Hey 
 Now that you're here 
 I don't wanna let you go (I ain't gonna let you go) 
 I don't wanna let you go (It took a long time) 
 I don't wanna let you go (I'll pray all night long) 
 Oh no 
 Whatever it takes, Lord 
 I don't wanna let you go (I'll do it, I'll do it) 
 I don't wanna let you go (And just like Jacob, I won't let go) 
 I don't wanna let you go (Till you bless my soul, Jesus) 
 I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go 
 I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go (Hey, hey) 
 I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go 
 I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go (Whoo) 
 I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna 
 I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna (Hey) 
 I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna 
 I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna (Hey) 
 I don't wanna let you go, don't wanna let you go 
 I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go (No-o-o) 
 I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go-o (Hey) 
 I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go (Sing it with me) 
 I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna 
 I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna (Yeah, hee, oh yeah) 
 I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna 
 I'll just stay right here (Oh-o) 
 Oh-o-o-o-o 
 Right here 
 I ain't going nowhere (Hallelujah) 
 I ain't going nowhere 
 I will just stay right here 
 In your presence forever 
 As the seasons (Seasons) 
 And days (Days) 
 Go (Go By) 
 I don't wanna let you go 
 I don't wanna let you go 
 I don't wanna let you go 
 For in your presence 
 There is fullness of joy 
 In your presence 
 There is fullness of joy 
 In your presence (Come on, come on) 
 I feel so secure 
 In your presence 
 Ooh-ooh-oh-o-o-o-oh 
 All you need is God's presence 
 You've been trying to do it on your own 
 But, let his anointing cover you 
 And let his glory cover you 
 In your presence 
 I feel so much love 
 In your presence

Talking: We gon fight 2x 
 4x Chorus: I'm fighting temptations 2x I'm fighting fighting 2x 
 Verse 1: Ah, I'm trying to live a godly life 
 Be lying if I said it ain't hard 
 I can't even open my eyes 
 'Cause everything is Rated R 
 Can't believe what I'm seeing, I'm speechless 
 All I see is your booty and cleavage 
 You jus tryin' to find my weakness 
 I'm determined to pass your test 
 Verse 2: Ah, Tryin' to be spirit lit 
 I ain't gon let you in my head 
 And like a spider you are weaving your web 
 Tryin' to get a brotha in your bed 
 You don't like it, that I'm standing tall 
 Though the reason why faith didn't fall 
 So put away your seduced lips 
 I know the devil's all in your kiss 
 Verse 3: Ah, under pressure to make this money 
 This recession makin' things so hard 
 I don't wanna do nothing illegal 
 Then I gotta put my trust in god 
 Lord, I'm reaching out for help 
 I can't win the war by myself 
 Lord, I need a little more patience 
 And more strength so I can fight temptations 
 Vamp: Everytime I turn around, I can see you trying to take me down, trying to keep me bound. The anointing on my life just won't allowyou to trap me, zap me, stop me, block me. God's got me in his hands, somebody gotaa stand, I'll be the man. I refuse to run, yep, I'm the one, that's gonna get the job done, God's son. 
 Like David, I'm gonna slay the giant, you know god's wit me, you can't deny it. Tryin' yo best to keep me quiet, what you sellin I refuse to buy it. You might as well find someone else to lie with. Every disease, you probably got it, keep it to yourself, because I don't want it. No, I don't want it.

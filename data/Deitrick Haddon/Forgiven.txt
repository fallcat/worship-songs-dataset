Can you hear me 
 Yeap 
 Come on friends Can you lift your hands 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 3x 
 Can I have a moment of your time 
 I'm going to come from my heart 
 I know what I'm about to tell you 
 Is going to hit you where you are 
 See I was raised in the church but I 
 Found a way to do my dirt 
 See I was a preacher's son and you won't believe the things 
 I've done but I said to myself you got to do better 
 You Can't keep living this way you got to get it together 
 When I humble myself and pray I knew God would listen 
 Today I can hear him say my son you are 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 2x 
 My past is behind me 
 I'm moving ahead 
 God has forgiven me 
 That old man is dead 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 2x 
 That was yesterday 
 This is today 
 I don't care what people have to say 
 People always judging everybody else situation 
 But when the tables are turned suddenly they get the revelation 
 Nobody has the power to put you in a heaven or hell 
 I don't regret the things I've done 
 Cause now I got a story to tell 
 And there ain't no testimony 
 If you don't go through the test 
 And you ain't got no message 
 If you don't go through the mess 
 Just humble yourself and pray 
 And give God confessions 
 And you will hear him say my child you are 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 2x 
 My past is behind me 
 I'm moving ahead 
 God has forgiven me 
 That old man is dead 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 2x (Forgiven for the sins you committed?and even though you did it) 
 That was yesterday 
 This is today 
 I don't care what people have to say 
 No I'm not innocent no 
 God know I've did some things yeah 
 Somebody need to understand 
 That you can put your sins in the master hands 
 Now bow your head and repeat after me right now 
 Say father forgive me 
 I'm a sinner I need you 
 Come in to my heart and change my world around 
 Forgive me Oh Lord 
 Forgive me right now 
 I can't go another day 
 Living my life this way 
 You died for me 
 You rose and I confess you are Lord 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 2x 
 My past is behind me 
 I'm moving ahead 
 God has forgiven me 
 That old man is dead 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 2x 
 That was yesterday 
 This is today 
 I don't care what people have to say 
 Forgiven (4x) Oh repeat 2

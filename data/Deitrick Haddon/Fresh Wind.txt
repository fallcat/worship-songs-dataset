Send a fresh wind 
 Send a fresh wind 
 Let it flow, let it flow 
 Let it flow from heaven above 
 Flow from the east 
 Flow from the west 
 Send Your anointing 
 So I can be blessed 
 Flow from the north 
 Flow from the south 
 Send Your anointing 
 Straight from my mouth 
 Send a fresh wind 
 Send a fresh wind 
 Let it flow, let it flow 
 Let it flow from heaven above 
 Flow from the east 
 Flow from the west 
 Send Your anointing 
 So I can be blessed 
 Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow 
 Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow 
 Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow 
 Let it flow, let it flow 
 Send Your anointing, Lord

If you feel like you're stuck in a place 
 That you know that you ain't suppose to be in 
 And you wanna get out, but you're gonna lose out 
 And you don't know the first thing to do 
 But you know you gotta make a move before the bottom falls out 
 Let me help you out 
 You don't have to stay, you can get away 
 You can do it if you wanna, come on out of that corner 
 Don't you be afraid, come on where's your faith? 
 Put some work behind your faith and just believe it 
 Go with me 
 All you gotta do is put one foot in front of the other 
 Go with me 
 There's a place where we can go where everybody loving each other 
 Go with me 
 There's a lot of space 
 Go with me 
 Come and take your place 
 Go with me 
 Come on, come on, you won't regret it, come on 
 There's a lot people going through the same thing 
 That you are going through everyday 
 So you're not alone, no you're not alone 
 But you will never know it 'cause they ain't going to show it 
 People take away the funk their own 
 Like they got it under control 
 You don't have to stay, you can get away 
 You can do it if you wanna, come on out of that corner 
 Don't you be afraid, come on where's your faith? 
 Put some work behind your faith and just believe it

 Go with me 
 There's a place where we can go where everybody loving each other 
 Go with me 
 There's a lot of space 
 Go with me 
 Come and take your place 
 Go with me 
 Come on, come on, you won't regret it 
 You have a choice, you can do whatever you want 
 All it takes is making up your mind to move 
 So what you gonna do? 
 Go with me, go with me, go with me 
 Won't you go with me, go with me, go with me? 
 Go with me 
 One foot in front of the other 
 Go with me 
 There's a place we can go where we love one another 
 Go with me, go with me, go with me

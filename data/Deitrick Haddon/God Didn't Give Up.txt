Oh Oh Ok Mmmmmmmmm 
 God, didn't give up on me (didn't give up on me) 
 God, didn't give up on me (didn't give up on me) 
 When I gave up (well He didn't let me go) 
 And when I messed up (He restored my soul) 
 And Oh it was God, that didn't give up 
 Read in the paper the other day 
 About preacher fell from grace 
 He begged the church for forgiveness 
 He realized he made a mistake 
 And some folks left the church and said 
 Your supposed to be a man of the cloth 
 See they forgot he was the same man 
 That prayed for them when they were lost 
 So Glad God is not like man 
 He won't throw you away after you've done wrong 
 But, he will pick you up and, dust you off 
 And put you back where you belong 
 God, didn't give up on me (didn't give up on me) 
 God, didn't give up on me (didn't give up on me) 
 When I gave up (well He didn't let me go) 
 And when I messed up (He restored my soul) 
 Oh it was God, that didn't give up 
 Listen, now it's easy to point the finger 
 When the spotlights down on you 
 Well, and we would be surprised to see 
 If the truth come out on you 
 And you need to show a little mercy and grace 
 For somebody else 
 Oh, and take your foot off your brother 
 And consider yourself 
 So Glad God is not like man 
 He won't throw you away after you've done wrong 
 But, he will pick you up and, dust you off 
 And put you back where you belong 
 You'll never! (you'll never, never) No Never! 
 Never let me faaaall 
 When I need you, I can call you, call you 
 (Godddd Godddd Oh Oh] say [x7) 
 When I gave up 
 He didn't let me go 
 And when I messed up 
 You didn't give up on me

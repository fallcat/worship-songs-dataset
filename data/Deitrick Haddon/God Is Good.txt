Put your hands together 
 Well I said put your hands together now 
 (Vocalizing) 
 Listen Y'all 
 Let me take a minute and testify 
 Tell the word what God has done in my life 
 Let me tell you that he took away the hurt and the pain 
 And now I gotta give him praise 
 I'm sayin' 
 (Oh) God is good (God is good all the time yeah) 
 All the time (And I wonder can I get a witness I'm sayin') 
 All the time 
 God is good 
 (He's a good God) 
 He's a good God (good God) 
 Now if the Lord ever came through for you 
 Let me see you lift your hands and praise him too (Yeah) 
 And when I was weak You made me strong 
 Gave me strength to carry on

 All the time

 Can I say it like this y'all

Tryna' make it to heaven, stuck on the moon 
 How beautiful earth is from this point of view 
 So much evil back on the ground 
 Gravity keeps on bringing me down (down down down) 
 Yeah... Whooh ah (Bringing me down) 
 Yeah... ah ... Yeah 
 ? Just have to let my light shine 
 Like the sun that aluminates the sky so bright 
 Like the stars that chase away the dawn this night 
 Church by it would be whoa like the moon that flow, let's go 
 Lord, I want to be where you are 
 But in my flesh Lord, I can only go so far 
 It's like a test, every time I try to raise the bar 
 I want to worship, really, but it's too much gravity 
 Tryna' make it to heaven, stuck on the moon 
 How beautiful earth is from this point of view 
 So much evil back on the ground 
 Gravity keeps on bringing me down 
 So much hatred, famine and wars 
 I don't want to go back anymore 
 Wanna share with the world the peace that I found 
 But gravity keeps on bring me down 
 Gravity... Keeps bringing me down 
 Gravity... Keeps bringing me down 
 Gravity... Keeps bringing me down 
 Gravity... Keeps bringing me down 
 If I can just fly away 
 From the negative energy that's strongest my faith 
 Get on a space ship, take a trip through space 
 Go with me sight seeing through the milky way 
 How did you make Pluto, Jupiter and Mars 
 Only you can make Venus, Neptune and Stars 
 And ? makes me feel like I can just surf in gravity 
 Brings me way back down to Earth 
 Yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah eh

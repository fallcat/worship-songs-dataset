Mirror, mirror on the wall 
 Who's the greatest of us all 
 The greatest, the greatest, the greatest, Jesus the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus the greatest (x4) 
 What make you think that God didn't count the date 
 All the mistakes that you would ever make 
 Even though he knew that you would take the bait 
 He finds a way to love us anyway 
 What make you think that God don't have a plan 
 And if you fall he's there to help you stand 
 You made of flesh and blood but just a man 
 All I'm saying, 
 Is HE is the greatest, 
 Greatest (love) love of all; He is the greatest (greatest) love of all (love of all) 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus the greatest (x4) 
 People say with their lips that they love HIM 
 But in their heart they know that they don't mean it 
 Their placing everything else above YOU 
 Their love don't ever come through, believe that 
 Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Jesus is the greatest love of all 
 HE is the greatest love of all 
 Greatest (love) love of all; He is the greatest (greatest) love of all (love of all) 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus the greatest (x4) 
 You will never find a love like this and 
 Oh, all the others they be hittin and missin' 
 All you gotta do is give HIM permission 
 That's love with no condition 
 Are you tired of being abused, (yeah) 
 Are you tired of being misused, (yeah) 
 Give HIM all the love you have, (yeah) 
 And HIS love is given it back to you 
 Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Jesus is the greatest love of all 
 What you know about love, I'm talking bout love 
 What you know about love, I'm talking bout love 
 The kind of love you can't get enough 
 It come from above, man (x2) 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus the greatest (x4) 
 Greatest (love) love of all; He is the greatest (greatest) love of all (love of all) (x3) 
 Jesus, the greatest, the greatest love of all

Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Dear God I give You all the Honor 
 I give You all the praise 
 And I will give You the Glory 
 For the rest of my days 
 I lift up my hands 
 And I lift up my voice 
 And I'll shout it on the mountain 
 I'll make Jesus my choice 
 Lord we invite Your presence, have your way 
 And let Your glory fill this place 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Baptize me with your fire 
 All over my body 
 I'm walking in Your glory 
 So I can reach somebody 
 Had fortune and fame 
 But that couldn't fix me 
 I was walking in chains 
 Till You holy ghost hit me 
 These are the last days 
 Our days on earth are numbered 
 Church, we got to keep moving 
 No sleep, no slumber 
 We got to keep fighting until the last breath 
 Got to let the world know there's life after death 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Can you see it, can you see it 
 Can you feel Him 
 It's His Glory, standing before thee 
 Got to tell the story 
 Like I'm standing up on Maury, Povich 
 Not gonna sugar coat it 
 Jesus made me Holy, I'm hittin' the streets boldly 
 I'm telling them what They told me 
 Hold it, getting thick 
 Are you listenin' 
 People dreaming dreams, prophesying, having visions 
 Revival breaking out, have them crying in repentance 
 Thousands on foot, doing hood street missions 
 So listen 
 Glory, Halleluj 
 How it do, what's the deal ah 
 Cooking up another 
 With my brother on the real ah 
 Comin' in the presence and the Glory 
 Bout to fill ah 
 Actin' like you're hard 
 But you're softer than chinchilla 
 When the Holy Ghost 
 Takes control of your body 
 Jeremiah fire got ya feelin' lodi dodi 
 Couldn't keep it to myself 
 I had to tell somebody 
 Now I'm reppin' my Jehovah 
 And I'll never say I'm sorry 
 When I step up in the gates 
 I got to give Him thanks 
 When I enter in His courts 
 I got to give Him praise 
 I ain't worried 'bout a thang 
 'Cause I'm walking in faith 
 Move mountains with my mouth 
 I believe what I say, hey 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 When I think about His goodness 
 It's just doin' something to ya 
 So excuse me miss 
 I'm about to get my show up 
 And do my Holy dance 
 Off of praise in advance, Hallelujah

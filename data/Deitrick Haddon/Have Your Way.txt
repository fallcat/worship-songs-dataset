Have Your way 
 You can have Your way in me yeah 
 Can I be transparent for a minute? 
 Some of those rumors that you heard I probably did it 
 I'm not a perfect man I admit it 
 But it's covered by the blood I've been forgiven 
 When I think of things I've done I shake my head 
 If it wasn't for your mercy I'd be dead 
 God you sure know how to break a brother down 
 My humility I'm saying now Lord 
 Just have your way, 
 You can have your way Lord 
 Just have Your way in me 
 In me 
 Just have your way in me 
 (And Lord you can have your way in me) 
 Just have your way in me 
 (Will you, can you bring that for me?) 
 Yeah, I'm tired of trying to be a superstar 
 You can have the money, the clothes and the cars 
 I just want to be your man after your heart 
 I don't know how I drifted so far 
 Lord I'm asking you to take the pride away 
 I'm a sinner and I'm askin' for your grace 
 I got nowhere else to go that's why I'm prayin' 
 All I'm tryin' to say is 
 Just have your way, 
 Lord I surrender 
 Just have Your way in me... in me 
 Just have your way in me 
 (And Lord you can have your way) 
 Just have your way in me 
 I've come humble as I know how to be 
 Spend a long time since I've been down on my knees 
 And it's only you that can set me free 
 I'll be waiting here until you rescue me 
 And I don't care what people think Lord I need help, I need help 
 They can't put me in a heaven or a hell 
 Somebody ought to lift your hands and follow me 
 It's time for us to be what God wants us to be 
 Just have your way, 
 Lord I surrender 
 Just have Your way in me... in me 
 Just have your way in me 
 (And Lord you can have your way) 
 Just have your way in me 
 All to Jesus I surrender 
 All to Him I freely give

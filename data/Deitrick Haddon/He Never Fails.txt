This is my story 
 This is my song 
 I'll be praising my savior 
 All the day long 
 I'll never worry 
 I'll never fret 
 Because he never failed me yet 
 He never failed me yet 
 He never fails 
 He never failed me yet 
 He never fails 
 He never failed me yet 
 This is my story 
 This is my song 
 I'll be praising my savior 
 All the day long 
 (Solo: lift your voice and sing 
 All: oh uh oh) 
 How long must you carry this burden 
 On your mind 
 The lord is with you 
 All the time 
 (Modulate) Chorus 
 Piano interlude 
 (Be) With you always (4ce) 
 All: 
 Always uh always 
 <End>

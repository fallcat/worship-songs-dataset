 Leader: 
 Exceedingly 
 Abundantly 
 Above all, all you can ask from him 
 According to, the power 
 That worketh in you 
 God is able to do just what he said he would do 
 He's gonna fulfill every promise to you 
 Don't give up on God, 'cause he won't give up on you 
 He's able 
 God is able to do just what he said he would do 
 He's gonna fulfill every promise to you 
 Don't give up on God, 'cause he won't give up on you 
 He's able [x2]

 Vamp:

 Leader: 
 Don't give up on God [x2] 
 Anybody ever wanted to give up 
 Has anybody ever wanted to throw in the tile 
 Anybody know God to be able 
 Don't give up on God, 'cause he won't give up on you 
 He's able 
 Ending: 
 Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, he's able 
 He's able [till fade]

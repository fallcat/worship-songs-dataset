The homeless is still homeless, the poor is still poor 
 Yet we find billions of dollars to fund senseless wars 
 And yes, we're fighting terrorism, what about the quiet racism? 
 Divided among ourselves, somebody's crying for help 
 Heaven is listening

 Heaven is watching 
 (Watching) 
 Heaven knows

 And they may not play this on the radio 
 'Cause the devil don't want you to know 
 If we don't stop the hypocrisy 
 The nation will lose it's soul 
 They'd rather play music about money and sex 
 Like we don't have no intellect 
 Somebody need to show some respect 
 'Cause God ain't through with us yet 
 Heaven is listening

 Heaven knows, heaven knows the preachers that's not preachin' 
 (Heaven knows) 
 And heaven knows the teachers that's not teachin' 
 (Knows) 
 Heaven knows the politicians that's stealing 
 Heaven knows, heaven knows the ones that are out there killing 
 Oh, heaven knows that the world needs a revival 
 (Heaven knows) 
 That we've walked away from the Bible 
 (Knows) 
 Heaven knows that the world needs healing 
 (Heaven knows) 
 That somewhere we've lost our feelin' 
 Heaven is listening

 Heaven is watching

Heavenly Father, I stand before You with a broken spirit on bended knees 
 And Lord, I'm tired of doing things my way and I surrender my all to Thee 
 (Ooh) 
 Heavenly Father this is my prayer, 
 Draw me nearer 
 I feel Your spirit 
 I know You are there 
 Draw me nearer 
 Heavenly Father 
 Guide me on this road of life with your sweet grace 
 Light my pathway every single day as I try to seek Your face 
 (Ooh) 
 Heavenly Father this is my prayer, 
 Draw me nearer 
 I feel Your spirit 
 I know You are there 
 Draw me nearer

Your day is someone's night, your smile is someone's cry 
 Even when you're happy, there is someone somewhere hurting 
 And though the sun fill your sky, tears fill someone else's eyes 
 Even though you're all right, there is someone lonely tonight, so 
 Help me Lord, please to touch somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Touch me Lord, please to help somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Someone's full of sorrow, with no hope for tomorrow 
 Searchin' for the answer 'cause they have no one to follow 
 Make me an example, so I can lead them to You 
 Let me be the pathway, with Your help I know they'll feel brand new 
 Help me Lord, please to touch somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Touch me Lord please to help somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Somebody's losin' faith, fallin' away from grace 
 Ooh, Lord, take us to another place 
 They're on the verge of lettin' go, you're about to lose a soul 
 Please hear my cry, touch me help me please 
 Help me Lord, please to touch somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Touch me Lord, please to help somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Help me Lord, please to touch somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Touch me Lord, please to help somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Help me Lord, please to touch somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved 
 Touch me Lord, please to help somebody 
 'Cause everybody needs to know they're loved

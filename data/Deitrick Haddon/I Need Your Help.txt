In Your presence by myself, it's You and me Lord and no one else, and I don't have to say a whole lot of things. 
 You already know I need Your help, my enemies want to see me fall, so they can say I told you so. 
 Mmmm, Lord I don't mean to bother You with my small problems, but there is no where else I can go. 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
 Lord, I need your help (x2) 
 Lord at thy feet I fall, and Lord I surrender all, and if You can forgive me of my sins, I know that I can start all over again, hey, 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 You got it now sing it with me... 
 Lord (Say I) I (I really do) need (yeah) Your help 
 (I tried to do it on my own but I found out) 
 Lord (I need) I (I need ya) need Your help 
 I traveled long on every side, there's no where to run or hide, won't You hear my humble cry (yeah!) 
 Lord I need your help (x4)

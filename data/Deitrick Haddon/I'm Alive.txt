Hey hey hey I'm alive 
 Look in the mirror tell me (tell me what you see) 
 All the expressions of the (life that should'nt be) 
 Are you in a place you fell far from grace 
 It's not over till it's over 
 I can relate 'cause I've been there before (I've been there before) 
 The battles not yours so you don't have to fight no more (no more) 
 Your still here so let go of your fears and say 
 I'm alive 
 Don't just sit there get up and tell the world that 
 I'm alive 
 It belongs to you 
 So go and get your life back and say 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Use the next breath that you take to say 
 Hey hey hey I'm alive 
 I know you got a lot of questions (questions on your mind) 
 Searching for the truth and (will we ever find) 
 What's my purpose and help me understand 
 I just really need to know 
 Once again I've been right where you are (I been there where you are) 
 All you got to do is look deep inside your heart (in your heart) 
 Your heart is still beating so as long as your still breathing say 
 I'm alive 
 Don't just sit there get up and tell the world that 
 I'm alive 
 It belongs to you 
 So go and get your life back 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Use the next breath that you take to say 
 Hey hey hey 
 Just realize (that you have a job to do) 
 How you live this life is totally up to you 
 (You can sit back and watch your life just pass you by) 
 Make your dreams come true (or you can just let them die) 
 We all gotta go through things 
 But your gonna come out on the other side 
 So just proclaim that 
 I'm alive 
 Don't just sit there get up and tell the world 
 I'm alive 
 It belongs to you 
 So go and get your life back 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Use the next breath that you take to say 
 Hey 
 I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Ey ey I'm alive 
 Hey hey

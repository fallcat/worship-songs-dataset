There comes a time, for every man 
 When he must, take a stance 
 And confess, to where he's been 
 And ask god, to forgive his sins 
 To forgive his sins 
 Whoa, whoa... 
 It's me 
 And I'm standing in the need 
 It's me lord 
 Standing in the need 
 Oh it's me, oh it's me 
 And I'm standing in the need 
 Standing in the need of forgiveness 
 I can hear my spirit mend, telling me to make a stand 
 Turn away, turn away from my evil ways 
 So god can bring me brighter days 
 Bring me brighter days 
 Whoa... 
 It's me lord 
 Standing in the need 
 Oh it's me lord yeah 
 Standing in the need 
 Oh it's me, it's me, wow wow 
 And I'm standing in the need 
 Standing in the need of forgiveness 
 You know the preacher, 
 The preacher told me I would burn in hell if I don't confess 
 (Told me I would burn in hell if I don't confess) 
 That's what he told me (confess)

It's over now 
 It's over now 
 So it's over now 
 It's over now 
 I cannot expailn the way I feel 
 I must be dreamin', this can't be real 
 And I now I know that there's a God somewhere 
 'Cause when I called you answered my prayer 
 Sunshine after the rain 
 You have takin' away my pain 
 Someway and some how 
 It's over now, the storm is over now 
 It's over now 
 Um... no more tossing and turning in the middle of the night y'all 
 It's over now 
 No more fillin that something ain't right y'all 
 So it's over now 
 And I don't have to walk wit my head hanging down... no 
 It's over now 
 Cause my feet is on solid ground... oh 
 You took my fear and gave me faith and took away my shame and gave me grace 
 Then you lifted my burden off my shoulder and you didn't walk away when you came closer. 
 Sunshine after the rain 
 You have takin' away my pain 
 Someway and somehow 
 It's over now, the storm is over now 
 It's over now 
 No more smiling and cryin inside y'all 
 It's over now 
 And I don't have to worry cause God's on my side 
 SO it's over nowG 
 And now I can love again, I can breathe again 
 It's over now 
 Oh it's over... it's over

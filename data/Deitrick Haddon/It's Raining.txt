So incredible 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Tossing and turning sleepless nights 
 I know I got to get it right 
 Searching for something 
 I know I need substance 
 But I ain't got no appetite 
 And it's so cloudy, can't get clear 
 Man, I need to change my atmosphere 
 I guess it's time for me to face my fears 
 Lord, tell me where do I go from here 
 Tears flowing down my face 
 Still won't wash the pain 
 And I just want to get away 
 Can somebody stop the rain? 
 You said if I called Your name 
 You would come and save the day 
 I'm just trying to find my way 
 Can somebody stop the rain? 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 I got a whole lot of questions with no conclusions 
 You making me search out 
 And I'm going through the motions 
 Regaining my focus, seein' what you're all about 
 And on this journey through my soul 
 Things about you I've come to know 
 I relinquish all control 
 Lord, I'm soaking wet and I'm way too cold 
 Tears flowing down my face 
 Still won't wash the pain 
 And I just wanna get away 
 Can somebody stop the rain? 
 You said if I called Your name 
 You would come and save the day 
 I'm just trying to find my way 
 Can somebody stop the rain? 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, raining 
 When it rains, it pours 
 Don't wanna hurt no more 
 Will you comfort me 
 From my enemies? 
 And it's cold outside 
 I can no longer hide 
 Will you rescue me? 
 Come and set me free 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, it's raining, oh 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, it's raining 
 Oh, it's raining

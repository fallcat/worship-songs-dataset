Band! 
 Let me hear y'all say... 
 I vote JESUS! 
 Can I nominate, the canidate, who's actions speak louder than His words? Who else would lay down His life for His people, But Jesus Christ? And I know you've heard... 
 How He healed the sick, and raised the dead. 
 Thousands of hungry folks He fed. All in favor of Jesus say "I". 
 "I"... 
 He's the only man for the job. He's number one in my eyes. 
 I vote Jesus, Jesus for president. 
 He will fight for His people, until the end. 
 All of His promises are true. 
 Every word He says, He will do. 
 I vote Jesus! 
 Now, every election. We look to man, and they always let us down. 
 We thought change was coming, with the last pesident. 
 We were better off back then, than we are right now. 
 And poverty, in our country. Is at an all time high. 
 When we're supposed to be "The land of the free, and the home of the brave". When we're still treating our people like fugitives and slaves. 
 I vote Jesus, Jesus for president. 
 He will fight for His people, until the end. 
 All of his promises are true. Every word He says He will do.

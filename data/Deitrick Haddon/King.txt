Oh, whoa, whoa 
 Ooh 
 (I'm a, I'm a) 
 You can call me, you can call me king 
 (I'm a king) 
 You can call me, you can call me king 
 (I'm a, I'm a) 
 You can call me, you can call me king 
 (I'm a, I'm a) 
 You can call me, you can call me king 
 (I'm a, I'm a) 
 I'ma 
 I am a king, I was born on the Eastside of Detroit city 
 It's like a jungle but I survived 
 I used to dream that I had a pair of wings 
 And I would fly with the angels, I would hear melodies 
 Then I wake up, um, and I would tell my revelation 
 But they say, "You're just a boy with a big imagination" 
 (I'm a) 
 I am a king 
 Call me king, call me king 
 Call me king, call me king, king, oh 
 Call me king, call me king 
 Call me king, call me king, king, oh 
 (I know who I am) 
 I am in the air 
 Had to move to the Westside, didn't have no money 
 I was raised to have some pride 
 I used to sing, oh, sing to ease the pain 
 And I knew one day that my voice would bring change 
 I am a king 
 Call me king, call me king 
 Call me king, call me king, king, oh 
 (I know who I am and who I am) 
 Call me king, call me king 
 Call me king, call me king, king, oh 
 (I know who and who) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 You can call me, you can call me king 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 You can call me, you can call me king 
 You are the winner, you may have come from the slums 
 But you're the one, you were made in His image and glory 
 You're supposed to be, um, the leader of your home 
 Please understand my brother, I believe that you can 
 Leave the pain, eh, reach down in your soul 
 And you will reach every goal 
 And the whole would know 
 Ah, you are a king 
 Call me king, call me king 
 Call me king, call me king, king, oh 
 Call me king, call me king 
 Call me king, call me king, king, oh 
 How many nights I cried get here 
 So many others give up on the try to get here 
 You don't remember nothing else I said 
 Gotta get this in your head 
 You are a king 
 Call me king

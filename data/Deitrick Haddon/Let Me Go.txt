I realized the other day. 
 How much I strayed away from my first love. 
 I've fallen far from grace. 
 But now I'm gonna tell the enemy: 
 Let me go, In His name. 
 Don't have power over me. 
 I'm breaking out, Let me go. 
 Let me go. 
 Let me go in His name, won't delay my destiny. 
 I'm breaking out, let me go. 
 EEoooh, oh, oh, eeeoh. 
 I've been clubing doin' foul play. 
 Things I'm not to proud to say. 
 But today's a brand new day. 
 I've gotta fight to save my soul. 
 It's like I'm spinnin' round and round and round. 
 Like my feet cain't touch the ground. 
 And Father wants me back. 
 So, I'll fight you back. 
 I think I'm ready, ready. 
 Let me go in His name 
 Let me go, In His name. 
 Don't have power over me. 
 I'm breaking out, Let me go. 
 Let me go. 
 Let me go in His name, won't delay my destiny. 
 I'm breaking out, let me go. 
 EEoooh, oh, oh, eeeoh. 
 It's like I'm spinnin' round and round and round. 
 Like my feet cain't touch the ground. 
 And Father wants me back. 
 So, I'll fight you back. 
 I think I'm ready, ready. 
 Let me go, In His name. 
 Don't have power over me. 
 I'm breaking out, Let me go. 
 Let me go in His name, won't delay my destiny. 
 I'm breaking out, let me go. 
 Let me go, In His name. 
 Don't have power over me. 
 I'm breaking out, Let me go. 
 Let me go in His name, won't delay my destiny. 
 I'm breaking out, let me go. 
 EEoooh, oh, oh, eeeoh.

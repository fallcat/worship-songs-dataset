(Feat. Perfect Peace) 
 As his mercy endurance to all 
 Generation oh lord 
 And his race is suffiencent to all 
 All his people 
 Oh my lord 
 I don't know what I do without him 
 I don't want to think about it 
 If you took your mercy away 
 So I cry 
 Out for mercy 
 Out for mercy 
 I cry 
 Out for grace 
 Out for grace 
 Oh lord 
 Oh lord 
 Oh lord 
 I cry 
 Lord have mercy 
 Even when I am not in his will 
 Yet you still your love keeps moving on 
 Even If I have done something wrong 
 I'm glad your love keeps going strong 
 And I don't know what I would do about it 
 I don't want to think about it 
 If you took your mercy away 
 I cry 
 I cry Lord 
 Out for mercy 
 I cry 
 Out for the race 
 Oh lord oh lord oh lord 
 I cry lord have mercy 
 Oh I cry out for mercy 
 I cry out for the race 
 Oh lord oh lord 
 I cry oh lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Have mercy 
 For your people lord have mercy

Let our children live 
 And not die in the streets 
 Like the ones before them 
 Give them opportunity 
 That these walls would be broken 
 And that these doors will open 
 That these lies will be exposed 
 And that the truth will be spoken that these souls will be saved 
 From these last and evil days 
 Yeah 
 That all of Gods children 
 Will turn from their wicked ways 
 That we love one another 
 Like sisters and brothers brothers brothers 
 No matter the color 
 That we pray for one another 
 Yeah 
 No more hatred no more 
 No more deceit 
 That we get rid of jealousy jealousy 
 And we stand together 
 And the bound will be free oh free 
 And that we stop our selfish livin' 
 And that we learn to start givin' start given that the lost will be found 
 And that we go to higher ground 
 Oh oh ooh

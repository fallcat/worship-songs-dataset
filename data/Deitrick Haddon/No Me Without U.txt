There would be no me without you 
 Without you where would I be oh lord 
 If you hadn't brought me 
 Out of the darkness 
 There would be no me without you 
 Help me sing 
 Chrous: 
 There would be no me without you 
 Without you lord 
 I don't know what I'll would do oh oh 
 You have brought me out of the darkness 
 There would there would be no me without you 
 There would be no love without you 
 I don't know what I'll do 
 If you hadn't sent me your love from above 
 There would be no love without you 
 Can you help me sing 
 There would be no me without you 
 Ooh no love I don't know what I'll do 
 You have brought me out of the darkness 
 There would be no me without you 
 When everyone turn me away 
 Turn you away 
 You said it's all right its okay 
 Even though I know that I'm nothing but clay 
 You made me and shaped me your way 
 Ooh without you 
 There will be no morning sun 
 Without you 
 There would be no moon above 
 Without you 
 I wouldn't be able to see 
 Oh lord 
 There would be no me without you 
 Without you 
 My life would be torn down 
 Without you 
 I'll have no love in my heart 
 Without you 
 I'll have no reason to smile 
 There would be no me without you 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
 Help me sing 
 Sing this song hey 
 All right all right all right 
 There would be no me without you 
 There will be no sunny days 
 The rain won't go away 
 There will be no me wiithout you 
 There would be no church in site 
 There will be tears all in my eyes 
 There will be no me without you 
 Never have no peace inside 
 No way I can survive 
 There will be no me without you 
 Wouldn't want to be 
 Wouldn't want to be without you love 
 There would be no me without you

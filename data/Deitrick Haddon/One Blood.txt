Yep, all over the world 
 One blood, oh, come on love, listen 
 I'm sitting here thinking to myself 
 People all over the world are in need of help 
 From the shores of India back to the hood 
 People everywhere are misunderstood 
 But I 
 (I still believe) 
 That love is the answer 
 (I believe) 
 That we still can come together 
 (Holding on) 
 Keep holding on to what I know is true 
 I'm pouring my heart, my heart out to you 
 You and I 
 (You and I) 
 One 
 (Are one and the same) 
 Red Blood 
 (Red blood) 
 Flowing through one 
 (Flowing through one vain) 
 Hear you crying 
 (I hear you crying for change) 
 I feel your pain 
 One blood, one blood 
 One blood, one blood 
 Maybe someone will listen 
 To what I have to say 
 And we're killing each other 
 And it's not okay 
 Somebody tell me why 
 We're tearing each other down 
 And the blood from the innocent 
 Is crying from the ground 
 (I still believe) 
 That love is the answer 
 (I believe) 
 That we still can come together 
 (Holding on) 
 To what I know is true, oh 
 I'm singing this song 
 Pouring my heart out to you 
 You and I 
 (You and I) 
 Are one the same 
 (Are one and the same) 
 Red blood 
 (Red blood) 
 Flowing through one 
 (Flowing through one vein) 
 I hear you crying 
 (I hear you crying) 
 For a change 
 (For change) 
 I can feel 
 (I feel) 
 Your pain 
 (Your pain) 
 You and I 
 (You and I) 
 Are one 
 (Are one and the same) 
 Red blood 
 (Red blood) 
 Flowing through one vein 
 (Flowing through one vein) 
 I hear you crying 
 (I hear you crying) 
 For a change 
 (For a change) 
 I can feel 
 (I feel) 
 Your pain 
 (Your pain) 
 I feel your pain 
 (You're not by yourself I can) 
 Feel your pain 
 (You're my brother I can) 
 Feel your pain 
 (You're my sister I can) 
 Feel your pain 
 One blood, one blood 
 One blood, one blood 
 Feel your pain 
 Feel your pain 
 Feel your pain 
 Feel your pain 
 One blood, one blood 
 One blood, one blood

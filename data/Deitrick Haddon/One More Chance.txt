Yeah, Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Oh 
 Can you give me just one more chance? 
 Can you give me just one more chance? 
 All I'm asking for is one more chance. 
 I'm just a dead man walking 
 I got nothing to lose 
 Tomorrow is not promised 
 Might is well tell the truth 
 Truth is I always loved ya' 
 My pride got in the way 
 Gottta get this off my chest 
 I pray it's not too late. 
 You gave me everything 
 Everything I needed and more 
 I saw you reaching for me 
 That's when I slammed the door 
 But look at me now (Look at me now) 
 I'm just a mess (I'm just a mess) 
 And I must confess (And I must confess) 
 I cried all day (I cried) 
 Prayed all night (I prayed) 
 I'm willing to make all my wrongs right 
 One more chance 
 Can you give me just one more chance? 
 Can you give me just one more chance? 
 I refuse to go to my grave 
 Knowing that I treated you this way 
 One more chance 
 Can you give me just one more chance? 
 Can you give me just one more chance? 
 I'm just a dead man walking 
 Just hear me out 
 I'm asking for forgiveness 
 That I can't live without 
 Truth is I don't deserve it 
 I should be locked away 
 Throw away the key 
 Never see the light of day 
 Oh but they can't judge me 
 'Cause I judge myself 
 And I surrender 
 I'm in need of help 
 I need you to save me 
 I have learned my lesson 
 Here it is Lord 
 This is my confession. 
 I lied (I lied) 
 I cheated (I cheated) 
 When I should have fought for love 
 I retreated 
 Then I placed the blame on you 
 Walked away, said I was threw 
 Looking out for me 
 Without responsibility 
 You tried, and I knew it 
 All along I knew what I was doing 
 The life I thought I had I lost it 
 I'm cleaning out my closet 
 How could I be so 
 Mercy on my soul 
 One more chance 
 One more chance 
 Just one (Just one) 
 Just one (Just one) 
 Just one (Just one) 
 Just one (Just one) 
 One more chance 
 One more chance 
 Just one (That's all I'm asking for) 
 Just one (That's all I'm asking for) 
 Just one (That's all I'm asking for) 
 Just one 
 I cried all day 
 Prayed all night 
 I'm willing to make all my wrongs right I refuse to go to my grave 
 Knowing that I treated you this way 
 Give me one more chance.

I pain it all red, all red 
 With the blood of Jesus 
 I paint it all red 
 All red, all red 
 With the blood of Jesus 
 Everything in my life I paint it all red 
 I've got so much to say 
 But not enough space to say it all 
 Hope you learn my mistakes 
 I hope you stand, and never fall 
 But that's not realistic 
 A good man fails, at least seven times 
 If you can never messed up 
 You can never be qualified 
 I dip my life in the blood of Jesus 
 I paint it all red 
 All red, all red 
 With the blood of Jesus 
 Everything in my life I paint it all red 
 What's a gift with no power 
 What's power with no passion 
 What's passion with no vision 
 Wh'ts vision with no fashion 
 There's a new world open to me 
 With favor cannot imagine 
 God had to knock me down, to get off the band wagon 
 To blaze a new trail, with new testimonies to tell 
 And to make it to heaven, sometimes you gotta go through hell 
 Memories of past failures, don't let them linger in you head 
 Just dip your mind in the blood of Jesus 
 Paint it all red 
 I pain it all red, all red 
 With the blood of Jesus 
 I paint it all red 
 All red, all red 
 With the blood of Jesus 
 Everything in my life I paint it all red 
 Mmmm God's working on a masterpiece 
 God ain't through with me 
 I feel like donatello, with paintbrush everywere I go 
 And the picture will be beautiful 
 Just like painting from michaelangelo 
 I feel like leonardo davinci, when he made the monalisa 
 Painted by the nail scared hand of God 
 I will be a new creature... Creature... creature

Oh yeah (guess who's back x2) 
 Oh yeah (uncle freddy deitrick come on) 
 Pow- ow-ow-ow-ow-Power x4 
 Say you wanna be star, you wanna rock hard 
 So you wanna be fly like me 
 Say you wanna go far, don't like where you are 
 So you wanna have the victory 
 Don't look at my whip and look at my grip and start thinking this life's easy 
 Had to walk by faith, had to struggle everyday just get to the point you see 
 This life I'm living is a battlefield, and when it comes against me I got my shield 
 Don't get it twisted the enemies real and he don't want to see us win 
 There's someone greater, living within (yeah) that is fighting this battle for me 
 Can't worry about the enemy, Holy Ghost in me is giving me what I need and that's POWER 
 Stand up if you've got that Holy Ghost's power x8 
 See you need a new car, gotta have a new job 
 You need to go down on your knees, you need to seek His face 
 Take a break from the race, make Him the priority 
 Don't look at the way that the Lord blessed me, and start thinking I got it for free 
 Had to walk by faith, had to struggle everyday just get to the point you see 
 This life I'm living is a battlefield, and when it comes against me I got my shield 
 Don't get it twisted the enemies real and he don't want to see us win 
 There's someone greater, living within (yeah) that is fighting this battle for me 
 Can't worry about the enemy, Holy Ghost in me is giving me what I need and that's POWER 
 Stand up if you've got that Holy Ghost's power x8 
 Holy Ghost moving all up and down your spine, working miracles, giving sight to the blind 
 Can't you feel the glory, I feel it all on me, I'm gonna make the winning shot like Kobe 
 Hands up in the air everywhere, can't you feel His presence in the atmosphere 
 And if you're not ashamed, if you're not a coward, Stand up if you got that power 
 Stand up if you've got that Holy Ghost's power x24

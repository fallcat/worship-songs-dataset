Prayer, oh, prayer 
 Prayer, it changes things 
 I know that prayer, oh, prayer 
 It changes things 
 There was a mother crying all night long because of her daughter 
 That ran away from home, she said why should I be cryin when I know 
 How to pray, surely my god will make a way 
 When she got down on her knees and began to talk to the lord, 
 She heard a knock in, a knock in at her door, and when she answered 
 She said "who could it be?", it was her daughter sayin' momma please 
 Forgive me... 
 Prayer, oh prayer 
 Prayer, it changes things, I know that prayer 
 Oh prayer, it changes things 
 Yes, it changes things 
 Well the doctor said, that he wouldn't make it through, so he called 
 The family in to give them the bad news, but the family said we 
 Ain't goona let him go, 'cause we believe in god, he believe in miracles 
 So the family joined hands and they began to pray, and called on 
 The name that's above every name, just a few minutes later the 
 Doctor came runnin' in, he said" I got good news, your brotha is 
 Gonna live..." 
 Prayer, oh prayer 
 Prayer, it changes things 
 I know that prayer, oh, prayer 
 It chnges things, yes it chnges things 
 Brigde: 
 Much prayer 
 Much power 
 No prayer 
 No power 
 Get in a hurry 
 Take it home, you need some pray, god will deliever

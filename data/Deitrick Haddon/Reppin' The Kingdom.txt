 (Deitrick Haddon)

 Gotta get this party started right 
 Everybody scream to the top of your lungs 
 Holy Ghost gonna have you speaking in tongues 
 I'm a part of a dynasty 
 A family that's been set free like me 
 They call me D Haddy 
 Everywhere I go all eyes on me 
 'Cause when I lead 'em to the cross 
 God the Father is the boss 
 My job is to win the lost 
 Save a soul at any cost 
 We gonna go from the east coast to the west coast 
 Find out who's reppin' the most

 A south mile hood rep good on the joint 
 Get your hands up, rep your city 
 If you love him go and tell everybody you know 
 (Now jam) It's me from the D you gonna see with D Haddy 
 But enough about me 
 Rep that, for the lost 
 Rep that, for the broken 
 Rep that, you feel defeated 
 Rep that, you haven't lost

 Rep that, stay in His face 
 Rep that, blessed in this freedom

 The kingdom is my business 
 So you can call me a business man 
 I follow the scriptures 
 So you can call that my business plan 
 Do what He tell me to do 
 That is how my business is ran 
 Can't y'all beat my business brand 
 See me in my business stance 
 There's still fish in the air for the kingdom 
 It don't matter where they come from bring 'em 
 International or bilingual 
 We gonna let the Holy Ghost power sting 'em 
 Drug deals, pimps, thugs, kids, teens, or older 
 Bow your head to Jehovah

 And we gotta rep the kingdom everywhere we go (sang 'cause)

 Greetings earthlings 
 I know I sound kinda weird 
 Might as well get used to it 
 Accept it 'cause I'm not from here 
 We represent the kingdom of God 
 With all my flaws, my mistakes and all 
 When you talking Kingdom, man 
 You're saying God is Lord 
 And whatever else you're saying 
 Man, I get kinda bored 
 Cause all that really matter 
 Is who you're living for 
 And if you're reppin' Christ 
 Let me see you hit the floor 
 We represent the kingdom of God, man 
 We represent the kingdom of God, man

Heavenly Father, here I am. 
 It is me once again. 
 Lord, it don't feel good in the cold. 
 Outside looking in. 
 I need shelter from the rain, 
 'Cause it's bringing too much pain. 
 Won't you please take my hand. 
 Lord, I know you will understand 
 If you show me the way, I will be okay. 
 Yes, I will. 
 Lord, you're my resting place. 
 Lord, you are my resting place. 
 My rock. 
 My sword. 
 All fears erased. 
 I find in you security. 
 I seek your face, my resting place. 
 Lord, I been searchin' high and low for some rest for my weary soul. 
 Traveled far across this land. 
 Even gone through desert sands. 
 Trying to find some relief, searchin' for inner peace. 
 Oh, gotta find it. 
 If you show me the way, I will be okay. 
 Yes, I will. 
 Lord, you're my resting place. 
 Oh, Lord, I'll be right here waiting for your love. 
 Show me the way. 
 You're my resting place.

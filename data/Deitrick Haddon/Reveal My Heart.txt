Would you still love me 
 Unconditional 
 Would you still hold me 
 When I need you even though 
 I've done some things that I'm so ashamed of 
 Now I'm standing here looking out my window 
 Calling your name 
 I've got nowhere to go 
 I've got nowhere to run 
 'Gain I Reveal My Heart to You 
 I ran out of options 
 I've got nowhere to go 
 'Gain I Reveal My Heart to You 
 Would you still be there? 
 If I confessed to you the truth 
 I am only human 
 I'm trying to stop some things I do 
 Oh Lord, grant me your mercy?.Yeah 
 Oh Lord, I need your mercy?.Yeah 
 I wanna tell?.You everything 
 'Cause I?.I been here?.Much too long?.Too long 
 Save me?.From myself 
 My mind?s?.Been gone?.For too long 
 I'm open wide?.Like the sea?.To you 
 Can you be?.My best friend? 
 Hold me?.Console me?.Lord Please Hear Me?I 
 I've got nowhere to go 
 I've got nowhere to run 
 'Gain I Reveal My Heart to You 
 I ran out of options 
 I've got nowhere to go 
 'Gain I Reveal My Heart to You 
 I'm pouring my heart out to you 
 I don't know what else to do 
 Now I'm down on my knees 
 And I'm beggin? you please 
 Oh Lord I need a friend 
 I wanna tell?.You everything 
 'Cause I?.I been here?.Much too long 
 Save me?.From myself

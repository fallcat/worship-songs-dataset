 I could have been dead sleeping in my grave 
 But god blessed me to see another day 
 Even when I did wrong he was still there

 Verse One: 
 I walked in the church lord on a Sunday morning 
 Stood out side contemplating wether I should walk through the door 
 Ya see, a lot of folks knew me from way back when 
 People holding me to all those past sins 
 But I know all have sinned and come short of his glory 
 I'm just glad I'm still here to tell the story 
 I could have been dead sleeping in my grave 
 But god blessed me to see another day 
 Even when I did wrong he was still there 
 I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer 
 I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer 
 Verse Two: 
 Ye that's without sin, wont you cast the first stone 
 'Cause ain't nobody perfect but the man sitting on the throne 
 But it's about time for us to stop judging one another 
 Stop acting holier than thou and start lifting up your brother 
 But I know all have sinned and come short of it's glory 
 I'm just glad I'm still here to tell the story 
 I could have been dead sleeping in my grave 
 But god blessed me to see another day 
 Even when I did wrong he was still there 
 I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer 
 I'm so glad that god still hears a sinners prayer 
 Verse Three: 
 Now let me pray let me pray 
 Our father which art in heaven hollowed would be thy name 
 Thy kingdom come thy will be done 
 On earth as it is in heaven 
 Give us this day our daily bread 
 And forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors 
 And lead us not into temptation 
 But deliver us deliver us from evil 
 Hey hey hey hey hey he 
 For thine is the kingdom and the powere and the glory forever 
 Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever 
 I'm so glad I'm so glad god still here a sinners prayer

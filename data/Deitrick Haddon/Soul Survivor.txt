Yh! 
 Ladies and gentlemen, 
 This is a tray over dal exclusive, 
 Featuring deitrick haddon 
 Turn me up 
 I'm not one of those gospel singers that's foney might as well tell the truth, 
 You see I got a testimony can I share it with you?, 
 See my daddy was crazy, 
 And left my mother with three babies, 
 But she did what she could to stand, 
 Till god gave her a real man. 
 You see I'm so grateful I'm still alive, 
 In a drive-by was supposed to die, 
 When the streets was callin' callin' my name 
 Glad somebody prayed. 
 You don't know what I've been through to get this music out to you, 
 'Cause through the flood and through the fire, 
 I'm a soul survivor 
 Could've been six feet under but god is good, 
 He's a wonder and I'm going higher, 
 I'm a soul survivor 
 I'm a soul survivor, 
 I'm a soul survivor, 
 I'm a soul survivor, 
 Soul, soul 
 Said I came in this game with a new sign, 
 He said, 
 Give him a few years he won't be around, 
 Now its more than a few years and I'm still down, 
 All my haters what you sayin' now, 
 So much drama in the industry, 
 There's so much hatin' that you don't see, 
 People carry you down to stay on top, 
 I don't think that its ever gonna stop. 
 And I gotta tell myself just ignore them, 
 Just think about their souls that you must win, 
 It's your annoynting that they're scared of, 
 Just keep showin' them love. 
 You don't know what I've been through to get this music out to you, 
 'Cause through the flood and through the fire, 
 I'm a soul survivor. 
 Could've been six feet under but god is good, 
 He's a wonder and I'm going higher, 
 I'm a soul survivor. 
 Now let it breath 
 I've been talk about and critisised, 
 I've been persicuted and scandalised, 
 There was some that was truth but most were lies, 
 Because of god I'm still alive, 
 So much gossip up in the church, 
 People don't care if it hurts, 
 They will smile in your face like a friend, 
 How do we expect sinners to come on in. 
 You see you don't know 
 You don't know what I've been through to get this music out to you, 
 'Cause through the flood and through the fire, 
 I'm a soul survivor. 
 Could've been six feet under but god is good, 
 He's a wonder and I'm going higher, 
 I'm a soul survivor. 
 I'm a soul survivor, 
 I'm a soul survivor, 
 I'm a soul survivor, 
 Soul, soul x4 
 Wooh! 
 Let it breath

Oh' 
 I just wanna tell u a story 
 Oh... 
 The record company got me on the phone 
 This morning 
 They said, 'Boy, u betta get that record done.' 
 Felt under pressure 
 So I flew back home to Detriot City 
 I asked the Lord to give me 
 One more song to sing 
 Just one more song, one more 
 So I went to church with my mother and father 
 That Sunday morning 
 And momma preached one message 
 She said, 'Prayer is the solution.' 
 When she got through preaching that message 
 God gave her a song 
 This is what she said [x2] 
 Oh' 
 There's a power resting in you 
 There's a power resting in me 
 Stir the gift [x4] 
 That the Lord has placed in you 
 Yeah Yeah' 
 Good God Almighty 
 When she got through singing that song 
 It stirred up something on the inside of me, yeah 
 The anointing fell from the crown of my head 
 To the soles of my feet 
 And I just didn't sit there [x2] 
 I had to get up on my feet, 
 And I had to sing'. 
 There's a power resting in me 
 There's a power resting in you 
 Stir the gift [x4] 
 That's all you gotta do, yeah 
 Greater is He that is in thee 
 Than he that is the world 
 There's a power resting in me 
 There's a power resting in you 
 (God is going to give you everything you need) 
 Stir the gift [x4] 
 God has not given thee a spirit of fear 
 But of power and love 
 You gotta stir it up [repeat] 
 Stir up the gift, stir up your faith 
 Oh... I wish I had somebody out there

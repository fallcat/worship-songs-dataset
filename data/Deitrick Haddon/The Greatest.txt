Mirror, mirror on the wall 
 Who's the greatest of us all? 
 The greatest, the greatest 
 The greatest, Jesus the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus, the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus, the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus, the greatest 
 Whatever make you think that God didn't calculate 
 All the mistakes that you will ever make mistakes 
 Even though He knew that you will take the bait 
 He finds a way to love us anyway 
 What make you think that God don't have a plan 
 And if you fall be there to help you stand 
 You're made of flesh and blood, you're just a man 
 All I'm sayin' is He's the greatest 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 People say with their lips that they love you 
 But in their heart they know that they don't mean it 
 They're placin' everythin' else above You 
 The love that never come through when you need it 
 Oh, oh, oh, Jesus is the greatest love of all 
 He is the greatest 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 We'll never find a love like this and 
 All the others will be hidden and missin' 
 All you gotta do is give Him permission 
 Cause love comes with no condition 
 Are you gonna be an abuse 
 Are you gonna be misused 
 Givin' all the love you had 
 And it's never given back to you 
 Oh, oh, oh, Jesus is the greatest love of all 
 He is the greatest 
 Don't you know about love I'm talkin' 'bout love 
 Don't you know about love I'm talkin' 'bout love 
 The kind of love that you can't get enough 
 It comes from above, eh 
 Don't you know about love I'm talkin' 'bout love 
 Don't you know about love I'm talkin' 'bout love 
 The kind of love that you can't get enough 
 It comes from above, eh 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus, the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus, the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, the greatest 
 Greatest, the greatest, Jesus, Jesus, the greatest 
 Greatest love of all 
 Greatest love of all 
 Jesus the greatest 
 The greatest love of all

(L) 
 When you woke up, you should have rose 
 With... a praise, no complaining, appreciating 
 Another day, you are still alive 
 Someone didn't survive 
 He deserve so much more 
 Than what we give 
 All I'm trying to say is 
 Let life His word, I need the word 
 Got to have the word, He is the word 
 And His word, keeps us from day to day 
 The word is more than, just letters 
 On... the page, but it's a compass 
 And directions, when we lose... our way 
 And if we hide the word, within our hearts 
 We will never be the same, and then we will grow 
 After we have heard, we really need the word 
 I need the word, got to have His word 
 Christ is the word and His word 
 Keeps me from day... to day... oh yeah... oh... 
 The word, I can't live without it 
 I can't move without it 
 I can't breathe without it 
 Your word keeps me from day... oh... to day 
 Oh... 
 Your word is sun, wavering, on it we can depend 
 That word have I hidden in my heart 
 I need your word, I want your word... 
 I need the word yeah 
 I got to have it y'all 
 I can't live without Your word... 
 Your word keeps me from day... to day... 
 The word I can't live without it 
 Hey... I can't breathe without it 
 Your word ah... keeps us from day to day... 
 I need the word 
 Got to have His word 
 I want your word ow... 
 Your word... keeps us from day to day... 
 Word... 
 That the word of God renew you 
 That the word of God consume you 
 The word... 
 Let the word of God restore you 
 Let it break you, let it make you 
 Yeah... ah...

Give me a old school beat 
 This is what we gon' do with it 
 I gotta be feel with the Holy Ghost 
 Knot that ties me from my head to my toes 
 You said if I pray You would deliver me 
 Break those chains, Lord, that were bindin' me 
 Hey, only You can make me right 
 Lord, I'm askin' You to change my life 
 I need You 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 I wanna be free with Your Holy Spirit 
 And there are days when I just can't feel it 
 But I know You're there, You said You'd never leave me 
 And I must say, Lord You've been good to me 
 Lord, I'm askin' You for help 
 You've been better to me that I've been to myself 
 I need You to touch me 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 Touch me one more time 
 One more time 
 One more time 
 One more time 
 I need You to touch me 
 One more time 
 One more time 
 One more time 
 I need You to touch me 
 People right there clap your hands 
 I've just got a question 
 Anybody need a touch? 
 Anybody need a touch, a touch 
 Need a touch, hey, one more time 
 Anybody need a touch, a touch 
 Need a touch, hey, one more time 
 Anybody need a touch, a touch 
 Need a touch, hey, one more time 
 Anybody need a touch, a touch 
 Need a touch, hey, one more time 
 I need it, I need it, I need it 
 I need it, I need it, I need it 
 I need it, I need it, I need it 
 I need it, I need it, I need it 
 I need it, I need it, I need it

What do you do 
 When you just don't understand 
 And what do you do 
 When you just cannot explain 
 And what do you do say 
 When you just don't have the answers 
 Through it all, keep on trusting God 
 What do you do 
 When words can't ease the pain 
 And what do you do when you wake up 
 And things are just the same 
 Seems like it just won't get any better 
 Through it all, keep on trusting God 
 Yet will, yet will, 
 Yet will I trust Him 
 Yet will, yet will, 
 Yet will I trust' 
 What do you do 
 When life questions your faith 
 And all the dreams you had 
 Seems like they're drifting away 
 It takes all of your strength 
 Just to make it through the day 
 But through it all, keep on trusting God 
 What do you do 
 When you cried all you can cry 
 When you have to wear a smile 
 When you hurt deep inside 
 And what do you do 
 When there's no one you can call 
 Through it all, keep on trusting God 
 Yet will, yet will, 
 Yet will I trust Him 
 Yet will, yet will, 
 Yet will I trust' 
 Oh... keep on trusting God 
 Oh'oh'oh'oh-oh-oh 
 Through it all I will trust You 
 Through it all I, I will trust 
 I'll trust Him 
 No matter what I go through 
 I'm gonna keep holding on, holding on 
 Holding on, yeah 
 Through it all,(through it all) 
 I will keep, keep on trusting God 
 Though it's hard, (though it's hard) 
 Though it's hard, keep on trusting God 
 Through it all keep on trusting God 
 Trusting Him 
 I know it's hard (and I may have to cry sometimes) 
 Keep on trusting God 
 Gotta keep on Trusting God

spoken: 
 Yo, It's Haddy 
 All over the world 
 We gon do it like this y'all 
 This is for all God's people 
 (Vocalizing) 
 All of God's children when we U.N.I.T.Y 
 We can just get together, U.N.I.T.Y 
 (Oh) All of God's children when we U.N.I.T.Y 
 We can just get together, U.N.I.T.Y 
 It's time that we all understand 
 We can't live without each other's helping hands 
 Set our differences aside and became one 
 And love would overcome what hate had done 
 Bridge A: 
 We can stop this world from going under 
 We fought against our own but we never stand 
 Just like a house that was built upon sand 
 And there's a voice that's crying in the wilderness 
 If we come together we can stand the test 
 Bridge B: 
 There's no love 
 There's no hope 
 There's no peace 
 Without Unity 
 spoken: 
 Yeah, Celebration! 
 For All Nations! 
 Worldwide! 
 Everybody! Hands Up! UNITY! 
 spoken: 
 Yeah 
 All over the World 
 You and You and You 
 Whooooo! 
 Come On! 
 We got UNITY! 
 Hands Up! 
 Unity!

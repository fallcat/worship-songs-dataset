I feel so ashamed 
 To be asking You again 
 You have proven yourself 
 To be more than a friend 
 And You've offered me 
 The perfect sacrifice 
 You paid it all 
 When You hung, bled, and died. 
 After all You did 
 How could I not be satisfied 
 It's nothing but greed 
 I should go somewhere and hide 
 Lord please don't strike me down 
 Have mercy on me! 
 And I'm so unworthy 
 How could I be 
 So ungrateful! 
 So unthankful! 
 After all that You've done 
 I'm so ungrateful 
 So ungrateful 
 Ooh... 
 Lord, I look around and I shake my head. 
 It's as if You're not alive, they act like You're still dead 
 You've given the gift of life, oh that's a fact. 
 What would we do, if You took it all back? 
 After all You did, how could I not be satisfied? 
 It's my selfish-ness. 
 I should go somewhere and hide. 
 Lord, please forgive us for being so unfaithful 
 Lord, how could we be so ungrateful? 
 So unthankful? 
 After all that You've done. 
 So ungrateful 
 Oh, So ungrateful 
 So unthankful 
 After all that He's done. 
 So unthankful... 
 So ungrateful... 
 I admit I get beside myself sometimes. 
 I don't deserve to be called Your son. 
 And I'm, always asking You for something else. 
 When there are children that's in need of help. 
 Lord, forgive meeeee! 
 I'm Sorry! 
 So ungrateful! 
 When I should be thankful! 
 Please forgive meee! 
 Lord, I'm sorry! 
 I should be thankful! 
 But look at me, I'm so ungrateful! 
 So unthankful. 
 After all that You've done. 
 So ungrateful! 
 Oh, So ungrateful! 
 So unthankful!

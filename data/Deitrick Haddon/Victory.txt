Devil thought he had me but I got away 
 But I wanna say that I'm here to stay, hey 
 Look at me I'm standing in victory 
 I just wanna sing and shout 
 I don't have no doubt, that it was you Jesus 
 You're the one that brought me through 
 Get out of my way let me testify 
 Let me tell you how god changed my life 
 He changed all my wrongs to right 
 Got victory 
 I felt like throwing in the towel 
 You help me go that extra mile 
 If I hold my peace, let the lord fight my battles 
 He'll be with me to give me victory 
 If I just stand still, let the lord fight my battles 
 He'll be with me to give me victory 
 God said it, & I believe it 
 I got the victory 
 He said I got it, & I believe, I got the victory

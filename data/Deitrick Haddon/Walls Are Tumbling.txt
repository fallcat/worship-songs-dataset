(Feat. pastor paula white) 
 When I make a decision, god can so 
 Transform me with his truth, that no matter if 
 I look to the right, left, behind me, in front 
 Of me; how destructive everything looks, if i 
 Stay still and hear the salvation of the lord, 
 God is on my side, I'm making a decision by 
 The blood of Jesus. 
 See what the lord has done for us, see what 
 A mighty god he is. [x2] 
 See what the lord has done for us, see what a 
 Mighty god he his. 
 The walls are tumbling, the walls are tumbling 
 The walls are tumblng down, so let's praise 
 His holy name. 
 God's gonna disassociate you from the pain, 
 God's gonna disassociate you from the 
 Problem, god's gonna disassociate you from 
 Your past, help somebody. 
 See what the lord has done for us, see what 
 A mighty god he is. [x2] 
 See what the lord has done for us, see what a 
 Mighty god he his.

 The devil is a liar, that things gonna be 
 Uprooted today by the blood of Jesus, that 
 Things gonna be conquered today, 
 That things gonna be defeated today.

 It will not grow, it will not have manifestation, 
 It's over, decisions from my flesh are over, 
 Decisions from my past are over. you better 
 Put your hands together and praise him. 
 Better get you a dance in your feet, dance. 
 The walls are coming down.

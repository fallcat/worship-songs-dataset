Uh, uh, uh, uh it's d haddy 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 I'm glad you could make it 
 To The praise party of the year. 
 There's only one rule 
 You just can't sit there 
 Get up! 
 On your feet now 
 Dance wit me, praise wit me 
 Now it's about time for me to testify 
 Ima change my wrong to right. 
 And if it wasn't for the lord workin in my life, I could never survive. 
 Now with eveybody in got a right to praise, you know its got to be me. 
 Now move, back it up give me some space, 'cause I'm about to raise up in this place. 
 I can feel him all in my hands 
 Feel him all in my feet. 
 When the spirit comes over me 
 My praise comes *not sure wut they say* 
 Where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty. I just can't sit down on the lord after all he's done for me. 
 You make me wanna dance 
 You make me wanna dance all night. 
 You make me wanna dance 
 You make me wanna praise all night 
 (2x) 
 Look at what he brought you from 
 Look at what the lord has done. 
 Ever since he came into your life 
 He's been number one. 
 He brought me out of the darkness 
 Into his marvelous light. 
 That's why you gotta breathe him 
 Every day, and every night. (chorus) 
 Lift your hands up to the sky 
 And wave from side to side. 
 And if you wanna rock with us 
 Party with us 
 You gotta lift his name on high. 
 It don't matter what coast you from 
 Lets praise and have fun 
 Make Christ number one 
 From the early mornin 
 To the middle of the night 
 Let's get crunk for Christ. 
 Uh huh (uh huh), yeah yeah (yeah yeah), uh huh (uh huh), all right (all right), 
 Uh huh (uh huh), yeah (yeah yeah), uh huh (uh huh) all right (all right) 
 You make me want to dance, 
 Make me clap my hands lord. 
 You make me want to dance, 
 Make me clap my hands. (4x) 
 Lets Dance!

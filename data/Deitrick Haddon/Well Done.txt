Just wanna make it to heaven 
 I just wanna make it in 
 I just wanna cross that river 
 I wanna be free from sin 
 Ooh, I just want my name written (Oh Lord) 
 Written in the lambs Book of Life 
 When this life is over 
 I just wanna have eternal life 
 O wanna hear Him say 
 Well done, well done, well done 
 You can come on in. 
 Anybody wanna hear Him say? Yeah X 2 
 Wave your hands where I can see 'em... 
 Anybody wanna see your loved ones 
 That you've lost along the way 
 I just wanna walk those streets of gold, yeah 
 They say the half has never, never been told 
 I don't want my singing Lord 
 I don't want it, to be in vain 
 I just wanna cross that river of God 
 That's why I'm living, day to day, just to hear him say 
 I wanna hear 'em say, stand up on your feet, church 
 Anybody wanna hear Him say, anybody out there? 
 I wanna hear Him say 
 Wave your hands right there ... of the Lord 
 I want you to close your eyes, don't lose your focus 
 Your purpose for living in this life is to serve Jesus Christ 
 And on the Day of Judgment, when it's all over 
 He'll say, come on in my good and faithful servant 
 Come on in, come on, lift your hands and worship 
 Yeah, 
 I feel the anointing of God right now, I feel the presence of the Lord right now 
 If you wanna hear the Lord say well done, 
 I want you to scream 
 Anybody wanna hear Him say ? x2 
 Hear Him say, I wanna hear Him say 
 I wanna hear Him say 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You can come on in, my son 
 You can come on in, my daughter 
 You can come on in, you can come in

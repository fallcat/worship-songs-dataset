Hmmm 
 I just have one question 
 That's all I have today 
 Can someone tell me what love 
 I just want to know what love 
 Whoa 
 Lord have mercy 
 Hmmm 
 Let me take my time with this one y'all 
 (What Love?) 
 That won't give up on you when you going through 
 (What Love?) 
 Tell me what love 
 That won't live for you and die for you 
 (What Love?) 
 Oh 
 That won't change after time goes by 
 (What Love?) 
 That will wipe the tears from your eyes 
 (Nothing but the love of Jesus Christ) 
 Listen 
 Oh 
 I don't want to sound like I'm preaching but 
 Somebody's got to tell yeah 
 You have tried all the other loves 
 But they all have failed you 
 (Hey) 
 Are tired of being sick and tired 
 (Oh) 
 Going through the same ol' stuff 
 (Hey) 
 There's a voice inside you crying 
 Saying I've had enough 
 (What Love?) 
 What love 
 That won't throw your past up in your face 
 (What Love?) 
 And when your going through your test 
 You can trust that they won't walk away 
 (What Love?) 
 Oh what love 
 That won't pick you up just to tear you down 
 (What Love?) 
 What love 
 Nothing but the love of Jesus Christ 
 Now Is that what you call love 
 Got you pacing the floor all night 
 You're all messed 
 How can something so wrong be right 
 Tell me 
 (Hey) 
 Why you going around in circles 
 (Oh) 
 When you answer is so clear 
 (Hey) 
 Just let Jesus in your life 
 He will take away all your fear 
 God so loved the world 
 That he gave his only begotten son 
 That whosoever believe on him 
 Shall not perish 
 But they shall have everlasting life 
 Well, Well, Well, Well

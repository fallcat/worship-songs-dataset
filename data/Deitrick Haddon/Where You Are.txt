Glad you can make it 
 Now that I got you here 
 I got to tell you how I feel yep 
 Come on 
 Come on, love 
 You already know my feelings 
 Do I have to tell you again? 
 And I ain't going nowhere 
 I need you to know you can 
 Call my name whenever you need me 
 I'll be there if you just believe in me 
 Wanna be your bread when your hungry 
 Wanna be your water when your thirsty 
 A shoulder you can cry on 
 I'll never leave you alone 
 I wanna be, I, I wanna be right there where you are 
 Yeah, I wanna, I, I wanna be right there right there right there 
 Trust in me and I will be, I wanna be right there where you are 
 I wanna, I, I wanna be right there right there right there 
 I been watching you go in circles 
 And I been patiently waiting here 
 And loving you through it all 
 But I don't think you hear my clear 
 Call my name whenever you need me 
 I'll be there if you just believe in me 
 Wanna be your bread when your hungry 
 Wanna be your water when your thirsty 
 A shoulder you can cry on 
 I'll never leave you alone 
 I wanna be, I, I wanna be right there where you are 
 I wanna, I, I wanna be right there right there right there 
 Trust in me and I will be right there where you are 
 I wanna, I, I wanna be right there right there right there 
 Sing 
 I can't hear you 
 Where you are 
 I wanna be, I, I wanna be right there where you are 
 I've been waiting 
 I wanna, I, I wanna be right there right there right there 
 Trust in me and I will be right there where you are 
 I wanna, I, I wanna be right there right there right there

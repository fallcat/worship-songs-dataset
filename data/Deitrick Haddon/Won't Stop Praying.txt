You know it seems like forever 
 When you're waiting on your blessing 
 And trusting in God's word 
 Sometimes comes when testing 
 I refuse to lose my faith along the way 
 So I'll encourage myself and say 
 And I won't stop praying 
 Until you come through 
 Ooh I won't stop praying 
 Until you come through 
 He that waiteth on the Lord 
 Said their strength shall be renewed 
 God ain't gonna let you down no oh 
 He will do just what he said he'll do 
 And your labor is not vain no 
 Things are gonna change 
 I believe it oh yeah 
 And I won't stop praying 
 God is not a man that he should lie 
 His word is gonna come to pass 
 Even though days gone by 
 You've gotta keep holding on 
 Even if you have to cry sometimes 
 The night is almost over 
 I can see the mornin light 
 And I won't stop praying 
 Until you come through 
 I won't and I won't and I won't 
 And I won't stop 
 Won't stop praying 
 Won't stop praying 
 Won't stop praying 
 Won't stop praying 
 I won't stop praying 
 Until you come through

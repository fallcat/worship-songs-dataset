It seemed like I had to lose 
 In order to win 
 And when they walked out on me 
 Its when your love came in 
 And when I felt like dying 
 You made me feel better 
 Took me by the hand 
 You told me we could make it through this together 
 You were my strength x2 
 When I was exhausted 
 You were my strength x3 
 Helped me climb the mountain 
 You were my, my God, my sword, my shield, my joy, my life 
 Your love so real 
 You were my strength x2 
 You were, you were my 
 It's amazing to me 
 When I lean back and see 
 How I made it over 
 Men I thought it was over 
 And when my heart was shattered 
 Into a million pieces 
 Your love put me back together again 
 You knew just what I needed 
 You were my strength x2 
 When I was exhausted 
 You were my strength x3 
 You helped me climb the mountain 
 You were my, my God, my sword, my shield, my joy, my life 
 Your love so real 
 You were my strength x2 
 You were my 
 That is why I love you x2 
 Say with me 
 That is why I love you x2 
 You were my strength x2 
 When I was exhausted 
 You were my strength x3 
 Helped me climb the mountain 
 You were my, my God, my sword, my shield, my joy, my life 
 Your love so real 
 You were my strength x2 
 You were my 
 You were my strength x2 
 When I was exhausted 
 You were my strength x2 
 Helped me climb the mountain 
 That is why I love you x2 
 You were my strength x2 
 I will never forget how, you were 
 You were my strength x3 you were my 
 You were my, my God, my sword, my shield, my joy, my life 
 Your love so real 
 You were my strength x2 
 You were my

You have a friend, that will be there, until the 
 End, and all you have to do is just open your 
 Heart and let Him in, you have a friend. Some- 
 Body didn't have a father to lead them along 
 The way, and somebody didn't have a mother, 
 For whatever reason you shouldn't have to go 
 Through that pain. If you look back over 
 Your life you will realize that God has always 
 Been there. He's been holding your hand to let 
 You know that somebody truly cares. You have 
 A friend, that will always be there, until the end, 
 All you have to do is just open up your heart 
 And let Him in, you have a friend. If you find 
 One friend in the world, you should love them 
 Like you love yourself. 'Cause it's hard to find 
 Someone you can believe in and someone 
 You can depend on when you're in need of help. 
 What a friend we have in Jesus, all of our sins 
 And griefs to bear, what a privilege it is to carry 
 Everything to God in prayer. You have a friend 
 That will be there until the end, and all you have 
 To do is just open your heart and let Him in, 
 You have a friend. 
 This is for the girl that feels alone, and this is 
 For the boy who have no home, and this is for 
 The lady that's been misused, let me 
 Encourage you, you're gonna make it through. 
 You gotta a friend who will be there for you, no 
 Matter what you going through you know it's 
 True, you gotta a friend that will be down for 
 You, you've got a friend, you've have a friend. 
 You've got a friend until the end, all you have 
 To do is just open your heart and let Hm in, 
 You've got a friend

The promise which I made, to myself 
 Is becoming a lie, a concrete soul 
 When I look up in the sky, I see it's turning grey 
 The clouds are falling down, just because of their weight 
 When I look up in my eyes, they are reflecting burning flames caused by the heat inside, boiled blood flows through my veins once I believed in the spirit in me 
 Now the weakness is all I can see the devils thought flying away from my mind turmoil, trying to find it's way 
 Will I ever come back, can I carry the guilt now I'm falling into the depths of hate 
 Am I liar

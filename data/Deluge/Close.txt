Our destiny, felt from grace, a second chance, we may praise close to an empty hole that can't be filled. I glorify the man that wasn't killed I pray for every single day, the moment delays. cause it conscious me the love I feel and the fear I've got supported by a karma, holding our destiny in its hands. but prepares the way that slowly ends I've never been there, this world of shadows which are not yourself. well this world comes close. I cannot stand this deception, that he is gone, that she is gone, that you are gone but the fallen angel has risen. now I never forget what you mean to me it was not your fault, it was meant to be. well this was close and shall probably never ever happen again but never say never...

A prove of innocence, appropriate ourselves 
 Hiding behind a wall of glass behind a theory, an excuse, a symbol to fortify 
 The spirit we all share murder, persecution, genocide will never rise again 
 Until the day you recognize a breath of hatred, the same 
 As where it started it all before standard opinions cause a vague moral 
 Forgot the past? a search for deeper founded thought ends 
 And is based on nothing not only the symbol is wrong 
 It's a strategy to find a cause for boundless human stupidity a reprisal and cause of might 
 Remind a story told, that is lost in civilisation

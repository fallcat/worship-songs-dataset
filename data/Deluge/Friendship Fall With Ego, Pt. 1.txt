A shade of salt in an open wound 
 Maybe healed the injury but caused inflammation 
 My actions remain as oppositions 
 A helping hand pushed away 
 Will shivers run through your body 
 Will tears reflect the real you 
 Does this last strike mean eight years of friendship 
 'Cause when passion fades and roads divorce 
 There must be more than three empty words 
 And if there's one person I could say sorry to it would be you 
 But I could speak to walls 
 Old frictions still unspoken new songs stay unheard 
 And yet another part of me dies 
 Will shivers run through your body 
 Will tears reflect the real you 
 Does this last strike mean eight years of friendship 
 'Cause when passion fades and roads divorce 
 There must be more than three empty words 
 Empty words I hung weight on an unraveled rope 
 Removed the center of gravity until it broke I never walked away from my mistakes 
 My mistake - by self-compassion something precious dented 
 And if there's one person I could say sorry to it would be you - I know how you feel a shade of salt in an open wound 
 Maybe healed the injury but caused inflammation 
 My actions remain as oppositions 
 A helping hand pushed away 
 Will shivers run through your body 
 Will tears reflect the real you 
 Does this last strike mean eight years of friendship 
 'Cause when passion fades and roads divorce 
 There's more reason to heal broken words heal broken words

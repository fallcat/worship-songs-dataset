What if I didn't fear my temper I'd tie the largest brick around your neck 
 And dump your hands up in concrete 
 The threats equal with your sins 
 An attitude for the weak 
 But I could kill to watch you fear 
 So until now I dwell in obsession 
 Beyond the contents of words 
 And above the intellect 
 We're influenced by our reflections 
 So I had you high 
 No one can resist the beauty of compliments 
 Strikes the heart, feeds the head 
 But now it's called manipulation 
 For those who might not know - maybe myself I stood with both feet on the ground and looked rational on his ways 
 But objectivity is still a matter of world view I'd tie the largest brick around your neck 
 And dump your hands up in concrete 
 But I could kill to watch you fear 
 You threw the door 
 Right in my face 
 Strikes the heart, put me in place 
 Possession given away 
 Feeds the head again I stood above this world - again 
 And now the time passed by I accepted this endless fight 
 And now the time passed by I lay my head in feathers

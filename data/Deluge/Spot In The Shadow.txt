Hiding for what to come 
 In rain searching for sun a passion they'll never find 
 Fade away from values inside a flight to eternity, a flight in many ways 
 To a community, covered in suede heartless, we're members so cold 
 Today's in ruin, tomorrow's destroyed a spot in the shadow 
 A spot to free them from heat 
 A spot to turn in themselves our freedom, our wisdom letting them down 
 Cruelty, divineless, we're letting them drown in a world where only darkness survives 
 In a world where even the moon doesn't shine

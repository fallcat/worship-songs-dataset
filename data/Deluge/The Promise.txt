My inspiration's gone, creativity overcome 
 By an obsession for striving higher 
 Meanwhile time is passing me by 
 Inferiority is closing the circle 
 In which I still run 
 And that's what bothers me most 
 To walk a mounted road 
 But I hold on to the promise 
 To never give in 
 My inspiration's gone, creativity overcome 
 By an obsession for striving higher 
 Meanwhile time is passing me by 
 Inferiority is closing the circle 
 In which I still run 
 While the spirit completely disappeared 
 I lay my head in my hands to cover my tears 
 While the spirit completely disappeared 
 I lay my head in my hands to cover my tears 
 But hold on to the promise 
 To never give in

For every mountain that is high He is higher 
 For every burden that is great He is greater 
 For every valley that is deep He is deeper still 
 More than we can know 
 Our promise is Jesus 
 Our answer is Jesus 
 All to Him we owe everything 
 Our savior is Jesus 
 Our future is Jesus 
 All to Him we owe everything 
 For every fear that closes in He is closer 
 For every doubt that comes on strong He is stronger 
 For every battle that we face He has conquered all 
 More than we can know 
 We know the great God 
 We serve the great God 
 We owe the great God 
 Everything all to Him

You dance over me 
 While I am unaware 
 You sing all around 
 But I never hear the sound 
 Lord I'm amazed by You 
 Lord I'm amazed by You 
 Lord I'm amazed by You 
 How You love me 
 How wide 
 How deep 
 How great 
 Is Your love for me 
 How wide, O how wide Lord 
 How deep, O how deep Lord 
 How great, O how great 
 Is Your love for me 
 Lord I'm amazed, amazed by You 
 Lord I'm amazed, amazed by You 
 Lord I'm amazed, amazed by You 
 How You love me

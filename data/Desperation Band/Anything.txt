I bow my heart to the King that's above every king 
 For You, O Lord, can satisfy 
 I yield my life to the Maker of Heaven and Earth 
 For You, O Lord, can satisfy 
 And I love You more than anything 
 And I need You more than anything 
 You can move me more than anything 
 Oh, anything at all 
 I raise my hands to the friend that sticks close till the end 
 For You, O Lord, can satisfy 
 I wrap myself in the arms of my Father again 
 For You, O Lord, can satisfy 
 And I love You more than anything 
 And I need You more than anything 
 You can move me more than anything 
 Oh, anything at all 
 And I love You more than anything 
 And I need You more than anything 
 You can move me more than anything 
 Oh, anything at all, yeah 
 Only You, Jesus, only You, God 
 You can move me, Lord 
 You can move me 
 You can move me, You can move me 
 You can move me, yeah 
 You can move me, You can move me

 And I love, and I love You more than anything 
 And I need You more than anything

Look around, hear the sound of sinners found 
 We will see the walls come down, the walls come crashing down 
 Freedom reigns, people singing 
 Join the praise 
 We will see the walls come down, the walls come crashing down 
 And the blind will see and the broken man will walk again and the captive will go free 
 Look out, look out across the world, nothing can stop the Savior's work 
 We'll be the change upon this earth, we'll be the change, we'll be the change 
 Look out, look out, let all men see, we'll be His hands and be His feet 
 From now until eternity, we'll be the change, we'll be the change 
 Look again, saints are gathering 
 Hand in hand 
 We will see the walls come down, the walls come crashing down 
 And the blind will see and the broken man will walk again and the captive will go free 
 Look out, look out across the world, nothing can stop the Savior's work 
 We'll be the change upon this earth, we'll be the change, we'll be the change 
 Look out, look out, let all men see, we'll be His hands and be His feet 
 From now until eternity, we'll be the change, we'll be the change

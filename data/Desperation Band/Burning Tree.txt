I'll take my shoes and lay them down, 'cause I stand on holy ground 
 I'll take my will and make it bow, 'cause I stand on holy ground 
 Can I come closer? Yeah 
 Take my fear and all my doubt, I leave them at holy ground 
 All these things I'll do without, 'cause I stand on holy ground 
 Can I come closer? 
 And voice in the burning tree, come and burn in me 
 Set my heart a light with Your holy fire 
 God of the parted waves, be part of it all, I pray 
 Come like a raging flood and above all come 
 Now I stand, O Great I Am, surrendered to what I've found 
 Love that takes the sinner's hand and leads them to holy ground 
 Can I come closer? 
 Set your people free for freedom's sake, Your people free in Jesus name 
 The chains will break, the walls will shake and we will pray 
 Set your people free for freedom's sake, Your people free in Jesus name 
 The chains will break, the walls will shake and we will pray

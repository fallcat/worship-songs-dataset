If I have You and nothing else 
 I have everything 
 If I have everything but You 
 I have nothing 
 I'm letting go 
 I'm letting go of me 
 I'm taking hold of You 
 I'm losing myself and finding You 
 All I ever need 
 You are my life every breath 
 You satisfy me 
 You are the center of it all 
 You are the savior of my soul 
 You are the source of life how could I not cry Lord 
 You are the hope of greatest price 
 Jesus alone be lifted high 
 You are the source of life 
 You're the center of it all 
 You are the first and You're the last 
 You are everything 
 I count it all loss for without You 
 I am nothing 
 My heart thirst for You alone 
 My heart thirst for You alone 
 My heart thirst for You alone 
 My eyes look to You and only You 
 My soul longs for You and only You 
 My heart thirst for You alone

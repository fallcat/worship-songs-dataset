Never Stop 
 Never Stop 
 Never Stop 
 Never Stop 
 Never Stop 
 Chasing, chasing... 
 Every time I walk away 
 You are here a waitin' 
 And even when I turn my back 
 You are still sayin' You love me 
 Every time I look at You 
 The world starts fadin' 
 And when I hear You call my name 
 I can't help sayin' I love You 
 I love you! 
 I will never stop chasing You 
 I will never stop running after You... 
 Are all I want forever 
 Every time I walk away 
 You are here a waitin' 
 And even when I turn my back 
 You are still sayin' You love me 
 Every time I look at You 
 The world starts fadin' 
 And when I hear You call my name 
 I can't help sayin' I love You 
 I love you! 
 I will never stop chasing You 
 I will never stop running after You... 
 Are all I want forever 
 You are all I want!

I was far away but You found me and You 
 Made me want to stay 
 I was falling down but You lifted me and 
 Turned my life around 
 Now I'll follow recklessly 
 And I'll love You with all that is in me 
 I am coming back 'cause 
 You are coming after me 
 And I surrender now 
 When I lost myself 
 I came alive and You came into me 
 When I let it go 
 I realized You are all I need 
 Now I'll follow recklessly 
 And I'll love You with all that is in me 
 I am coming back 'cause 
 You are coming after me 
 And I surrender now 
 (Come on, Come On) 
 Now I'll follow recklessly 
 Yeah, I'll follow recklessly 
 Now I'll follow recklessly 
 And I'll love you with all that is in me 
 I am coming back 'cause 
 You are coming after me 
 And I surrender now 
 (Yeah, Yeah) 
 I am coming back 'cause 
 You are coming after me 
 And I surrender now 
 Yeah I surrender now 
 Yeah I surrender now 
 Surrender Now [x3]

Holy holy are You Lord 
 Great in glory great in grace 
 To You we run humbly now 
 Come make us clean again 
 In Your mercy quickly come 
 For we're in need 
 Here we are in desperation 
 Calling on Your name 
 Crying for our generation 
 Come to us again 
 Holy holy are You Lord 
 Great in glory great in grace 
 To You we run humbly now 
 Come make us clean again 
 In Your mercy quickly come 
 For we're in need 
 Here we are in desperation 
 Calling on Your name 
 Crying for our generation 
 Come to us again 
 You are God 
 And we love 
 Your holy presence 
 You are God 
 Fill the earth 
 And shake the heavens

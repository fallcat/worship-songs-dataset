Saviour of my soul, 
 Lover of my life, 
 I love You endlessly, 
 Passion of my heart, 
 Everything You are, 
 I love You endlessly. 
 You love me, 
 Before I knew of You, 
 You love me, 
 Now I give it back to You. 
 With Your Majesty here, 
 I fall to my knees, 
 I love You endlessly, 
 With the beaty of Your Son, 
 I find myself undone. 
 I love You endlessly.

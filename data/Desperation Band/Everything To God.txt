What kind of joy can make me dance? 
 What kind of love can make me sing? 
 What kind of grace is all I need? 
 Jesus is everything 
 I'm givin' everything to God 
 I'm givin' everything to God 
 I'm givin' everything to God 
 Hes givin' everything to me 
 Everything to God 
 I'm givin' everythin' to God 
 I'm givin' everythin' to God 
 Hes givin' everything to me 
 There's so much joy 
 There's som much love 
 There's so much grace 
 Hallelujah

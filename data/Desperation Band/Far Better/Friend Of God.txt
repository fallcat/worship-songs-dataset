Far better is to be with You 
 Even for a day 
 Than to live a thousand years 
 And to never see 
 One glimpse of Your face 
 As for me I want to be 
 Close to You 
 All my days I want to live 
 In Your house 
 So take me 
 Make Your home in my heart 
 Wash away these guilty stains 
 Make me like You are 
 Surround me 
 Closer than the air that I breathe 
 Because You have loved me 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 Far better is to be with You 
 Even for a day 
 Than to live a thousand years 
 And to never see 
 One glimpse of Your face 
 As for me I want to be 
 Close to You 
 All my days I want to live 
 In Your house 
 So take me 
 Make Your home in my heart 
 Wash away these guilty stains 
 Make me like You are 
 Surround me 
 Closer than the air that I breathe 
 Because You have loved me 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 So take me 
 Make Your home in my heart 
 Wash away these guilty stains 
 Make me like You are 
 Surround me 
 Closer than the air that I breathe 
 Because You have loved me 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 Because You have loved me 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 'Cause You have loved me 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 Say I want to be a friend of God 
 No, I want to be a friend of God 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 No, I want to be a friend of God 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 I want to be a friend of God 
 No, I want to be a friend of God

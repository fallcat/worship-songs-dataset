All of my life is just to be Yours 
 All of my days there's one thing it's for 
 All that I've gained, I count it as loss 
 'Cause there's only one that I want the most 
 O just to be Your friend 
 And just to lean upon You 
 I want to know the secrets of Your heart 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 All of my life is just to be Yours 
 All of my days there's one thing it's for 
 All that I've gained, I count it as loss 
 There's only one that I want the most 
 O just to be Your friend 
 And just to lean upon You 
 I want to know the secrets of Your heart 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 O just to be Your friend 
 And just to lean upon You 
 I want to know the secrets of Your heart 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 I wanna be, I wanna be Your friend 
 I wanna be 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 O just to be Your friend 
 And just to lean upon You 
 I want to know the secrets of Your heart 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 Jesus make me Your friend 
 To bear the mark of my Savior 
 To share the wounds of my King 
 To know the glory of my Jesus 
 To have the heart of my friend 
 To have the heart of my friend

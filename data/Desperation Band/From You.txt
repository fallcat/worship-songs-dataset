I will not make my bows in the rushes of gold 
 All the wisdom and strength of my own 
 I will not place my trust in the things of this life 
 For the one that I love is more 
 From You is everything 
 Through You I can live again 
 To You be the glory forevermore 
 In the cross of the [Incomprehensible] and my glory will be 
 And the one who left heaven for me 
 All my trust is secure, all my hope overflows 
 For the one that I love is more 
 From You is everything 
 Through You I can live again 
 To You be the glory forevermore 
 And from You is everything 
 Through You I can live again 
 To You be the glory forevermore 
 From You, through You, to You, Jesus 
 From You, through You, to You, Jesus 
 From You is everything 
 Through You I can live again 
 To You be the glory, forevermore 
 Yeah, yeah 
 From You is everything 
 Through You I can live again 
 To You be all glory, forevermore 
 Glory, glory, all the glory 
 Glory to your name 
 Glory, glory, all the glory 
 Glory to your name 
 From You, through You, to You, Jesus 
 From You, through You, to You, Jesus 
 From You, through You, to You, Jesus

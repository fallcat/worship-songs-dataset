Across the earth we see, worshippers believe 
 Hear our song 
 Praise to our God, praise to our God 
 From dawn to dusk we'll be, lifting up our King 
 Hear our song 
 Praise to our God, praise to our God 
 Bringing honor to Your majesty 
 There's no other like the King of all Kings 
 God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome name 
 All creation rising up to say we know 
 Our God reigns 
 Our broken lives were changed, when You broke the night with day 
 Hear our song 
 Praise to our God, praise to our God 
 Bringing honor to Your majesty 
 There's no other like the King of all Kings 
 God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome name 
 All creation rising up to say we know 
 Our God reigns 
 God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome name 
 Though the earth will shake and battles rage we know 
 Our God reigns 
 Out of ashes You, lifted us 
 To the table You came and filled our cups 
 Every heart and soul 
 All we are and more 
 Praise the Lord 
 Out of ashes You, lifted us 
 To the table You came and filled our cups 
 Every heart and soul 
 All we are and more 
 Praise the Lord 
 God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome name 
 All creation rising up to say we know 
 Our God reigns 
 To our God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome name 
 Though the earth will shake and battles rage we know 
 Our God reigns

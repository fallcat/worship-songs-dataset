No praise can define You 
 No thought can contain You God 
 No other one is holy 
 No other one is robed in righteousness 
 Glorious Glorious 
 Victorious Victorious 
 No light can outshine You 
 No other one is holy 
 No other one is high and lifted up 
 From the dawn of time You reign 
 To the end of days You're the God who saves 
 Sing! 
 All the earth will shout Your praise 
 You will never change You're the God who saves 
 Sing!

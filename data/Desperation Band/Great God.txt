Who is this God of heaven 
 The wind and the waves obey Him 
 Oceans of fear overtaken by Love 
 Who is this God eternal 
 Naming the stars in the galaxy 
 Wide open skies overwhelm me with love 
 You are a great God 
 Your love is so good 
 You send the broken heart rejoicing 
 You are a great God 
 Your love is so strong 
 You tore the vial conquered hell and You reign 
 You are the King of glory 
 With fire in Your eyes 
 You're coming into the sky 
 We're ready for You 
 You are a great God 
 Your love is so good 
 You send the broken heart rejoicing 
 You are a great God 
 Your love is so strong 
 You tore the vial conquered hell and You reign 
 You are a great God 
 Your love is so good 
 You send the broken heart rejoicing 
 You are a great God 
 Your love is so strong 
 You tore the vial conquered hell and You reign 
 I will give You glory I will bring You praise 
 I will shout Your victory for all of my days 
 I will give You glory I will bring You praise 
 I will give You all I am for all of my days

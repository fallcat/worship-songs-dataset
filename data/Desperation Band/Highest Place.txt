Lord You search me 
 And You know me 
 You hear all of my thoughts 
 No point in hiding 
 Lord You've found me 
 So completely in need of You 
 I cannot run from You 
 If I go to the heavens or down below 
 You are right there waiting 
 If I rise on the wings of the dawn 
 You are there, I will find you waiting 
 You are in the highest place 
 You are in the falling rain 
 You are in the mountain peaks 
 And valleys speak the wonders of Your Name 
 You are in the perfect sky 
 You're in every breath I breathe 
 You're in every moment life seems to pass me by 
 You're my Prince of Peace 
 In the glory 
 Of your glory 
 I become like You are 
 Its overwhelming 
 In the presence 
 Of Your presence 
 I finally see 
 All Your love for me 
 If I go to the heavens or down below 
 You are right there waiting 
 If I rise on the wings of the dawn 
 You are there, I will find you waiting 
 You are in the highest place 
 You are in the falling rain 
 You are in the mountain peaks 
 And valleys speak the wonders of Your Name 
 You are in the perfect sky 
 You're in every breath I breathe 
 You're in every moment life seems to pass me by 
 You're my Prince of Peace 
 You're everything 
 You're in everything 
 You're in every cry 
 It all ends and starts 
 With You my King

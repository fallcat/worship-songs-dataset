Through You the blind will see 
 Through You the mute will sing 
 Through You the dead will rise 
 Through You all hearts will praise 
 Through You the darkness flees 
 Through You my heart screams 
 You are free 
 I am free to run 
 (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance 
 (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You 
 (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free 
 (I am free) 
 I am free to run 
 (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance 
 (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You 
 (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free 
 (I am free) 
 Through You the blind will see 
 Through You the mute will sing 
 Through You the dead will rise 
 Through You all hearts will praise 
 Through You the darkness flees 
 Through You my heart screams 
 You are free 
 I am free to run 
 (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance 
 (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You 
 (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free 
 (I am free) 
 I am free to run 
 (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance 
 (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You 
 (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free 
 (I am free) 
 I am free to run 
 (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance 
 (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You 
 (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free 
 (I am free)

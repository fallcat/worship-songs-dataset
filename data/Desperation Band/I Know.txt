Whatever occurs I know 
 You carried the cross for my soul 
 You bled for my sin 
 Beginning life for all hope for all joy 
 For all unspeakable 
 Whatever the day we know 
 You conquered the grave 
 Saved the world 
 Now that we're free believing 
 What we know who we know 
 Is the truth so here we go 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 You turned the world around 
 Now I have found the way 
 That can't be shaken 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 You turned it upside down 
 Now I have found the life 
 That can't be shaken 
 And I stand on what I know 
 Whatever the day we know 
 You conquered the grave 
 Saved the world 
 Now that we're free believing 
 What we know who we know 
 Is the truth so here we go 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 You turned the world around 
 Now I have found the way 
 That can't be shaken 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 You turned it upside down 
 Now I have found the life 
 That can't be shaken 
 And I stand on what I know 
 It's true so I believe it 
 It's true so I believe in You 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 You turned the world around 
 Now I have found the way 
 That can't be shaken 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 You turned it upside down 
 Now I have found the life 
 That can't be shaken 
 And I stand on what I know

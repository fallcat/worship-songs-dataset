I Will Go 
 Desperation Band from Everyone Overcome Â© 2007. 
 Let Your kingdom come on earth. Let Your will be done 
 Let every kingdom of this earth bow. 
 Let the sinners sing for joy, we are saved by grace 
 Let every saint break through these doors and shout 
 You're calling out, "who will go?" 
 I will go. I will live the life. I'll give it all for Jesus Christ. 
 I'll tell the world that You are God. 
 I will go. Hear my battle cry. Give me wings so I can fly 
 And tell the world that You are God. 
 Here am I, here am I, I will give all that is mine. 
 Here am I, here am I, Jesus come and spend my life. 
 I will go. I will live the life. 
 I'll give it all for Jesus Christ. I'll tell the world that You are God. 
 I will go. Hear my battle cry. 
 Give me wings so I can fly and tell the world that You are God

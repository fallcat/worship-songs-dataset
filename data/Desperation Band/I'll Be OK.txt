I will throw myself down at Your feet 
 I will live out my life on my knees 
 You alone I run too 
 No one helps me like You 
 I'll be okay when I'm safe in Your arms 
 And the thoughts of this world fade away 
 I'll be okay with You 
 I'll be okay when it's You by my side 
 And the tears of this life wipe away 
 I'll be okay with You 
 I will lay down my pride for Your grace 
 I will give anything for one look, one look at Your face 
 You alone I run to 
 No one helps me like You 
 I'll be okay when I'm safe in Your arms 
 And the thoughts of this world fade away 
 I'll be okay with You 
 I'll be okay when it's You by my side 
 And the tears of this life wipe away 
 I'll be okay with You 
 I'll be, I'll be, I'll be okay with You 
 I'll be, I'll be, I'll be okay 
 I'll be okay when I'm safe in Your arms 
 And the thoughts of this world fade away 
 I'll be okay with You 
 I'll be okay when it's You by my side 
 And the tears of this life wipe away 
 I'll be okay with You

If all we have is love 
 Then all I have is You 
 If life is what we choose 
 My choice is You 
 I'm coming Your way 
 I'm coming Your way 
 I'm coming Your way 
 If all we do is try 
 I'm giving You all mine 
 If faith helps us to decide 
 I have decided 
 With all of my breath 
 With this heart in my chest 
 Every look in my eye 
 You know why 
 I'm coming Your way 
 I'm coming Your way 
 I'm coming Your way

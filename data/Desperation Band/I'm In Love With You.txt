All my heart with all I am 
 All I have I give to You 
 Your love has won my heart 
 And Your joy makes me draw near 
 So we dance and we sing 
 And we give our hearts again 
 And we shout to You 
 And we lift our voices now 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 All my heart with all I am 
 All I have I give to You 
 'Cause Your love has won my heart 
 And Your joy makes me draw near 
 So we dance and we sing 
 And we give our hearts again 
 And we shout to You 
 And we lift our voices now 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 So we dance and we sing 
 And we give our hearts again 
 And we shout to You 
 And we lift our voices now 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 Look how we love You Lord

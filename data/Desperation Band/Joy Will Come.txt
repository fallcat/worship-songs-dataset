Joy will come in the morning 
 Riding on the wings of the dawn 
 I know 
 Joy will come after mourning 
 As surely as You are God 
 Joy will come believe 
 Joy will come joy will come 
 Joy will come like the harvest 
 Reaping for tears that we sow 
 I know 
 Joy will run to the farthest place 
 Surely as You are God 
 What is this hope I feel 
 It's helping 
 What is this peace beyond 
 Understanding 
 You fix the broken heart 
 There's healing in Your wings 
 What is this whisper small 
 I'm hearing 
 So far above it all 
 It's speaking 
 You're still the sovereign Lord 
 There's healing in Your wings

All around the world 
 You hear now's the time 
 Break the chains and hold them high 
 Hold them high 
 We were made for such a time as this 
 To make a difference 
 In the world we live 
 Now we live 
 Who's dancing who's singing 
 Who's living a life worth living 
 We are we are we're shining 
 The light of salvation 
 Who's running who's loving 
 Who's breaking the doors wide open 
 We are we are we're shining 
 The light of salvation 
 Old has turned to something new and beautiful 
 Broken dreams are coming true 
 They're coming true 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 We're shining the light of salvation 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 We're shining the light of salvation 
 We have made our choice we are 
 We are a generation with one voice to shout 
 Of Your salvation

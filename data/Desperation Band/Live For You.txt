There was a time I was far from You 
 You came and rescued me 
 You came and rescued me 
 Now I sing of all you've done for me 
 Jesus, now I sing 
 Jesus, now I sing 
 You came and sought me out 
 And now I'm all about 
 The way you took my life 
 And turned it upside down 
 You are all I want 
 Your all I'm living for 
 You came and saved my soul 
 You are all I want 
 I live for You alone 
 Have come to break my fall 
 I live for You alone 
 There was a time when 
 I could not see truth 
 You opened up my eyes 
 You opened up my eyes 
 Now I see the beauty that is You 
 Jesus, now I see 
 Jesus, now I see

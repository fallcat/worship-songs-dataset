We stand in awe 
 Of Your unfailing love 
 That has covered us 
 We stand amazed 
 Of Your unending grace 
 We cannot repay 
 Jesus, wonder of the world 
 How we love You 
 Savior son of God 
 Be magnified, magnified 
 Our hearts bowed low 
 In your presence, Lord 
 We are overcome 
 Our hands held high 
 To declare Your worth 
 Your magnificence 
 The heavens can't contain 
 Your great love, your great love 
 All the earth will rise to say 
 You're the one, You're the one 
 Every heart and every soul 
 Will declare, will declare 
 Jesus magnified

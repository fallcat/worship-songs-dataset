Keep my heart amazed 
 Let me see Your wonders every day 
 Teach me in Your ways so that I may fear 
 You are walking on water 
 You are calling me after 
 You are standing beside me now 
 You are the Maker of Heaven 
 You turn my world around 
 You're making all things new again 
 Through it all I know, You are God alone 
 Set my heart on fire 
 Let me burn with passion for Your name 
 Take over my life, I surrender now 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 You are God alone

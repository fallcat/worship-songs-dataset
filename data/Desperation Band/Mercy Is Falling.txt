Mercy is falling, is falling, is falling 
 Mercy it falls like the sweet spring rain 
 Mercy is falling, is falling all over me 
 Mercy is falling, is falling, is falling 
 Mercy it falls like the sweet spring rain 
 Mercy is falling, is falling all over me 
 Hey, oh, I receive Your mercy 
 Hey, oh, I receive Your grace 
 Hey, oh, I will dance forevermore 
 Mercy is falling, is falling, is falling 
 Mercy it falls like the sweet spring rain 
 Mercy is falling, is falling all over me 
 Mercy is falling, is falling, is falling 
 Mercy it falls like the sweet spring rain 
 Mercy is falling, is falling all over me 
 Hey, oh, I receive Your mercy 
 Hey, oh, I receive Your grace 
 Hey, oh, I will dance forevermore 
 Hey, oh, I receive Your mercy 
 Hey, oh, I receive Your grace 
 Hey, oh, I will dance forevermore

Beautiful is for the broken 
 All the earth is for the meek 
 Living water for the thirsty 
 Strength and power for the weak 
 This is my God, holy and pure 
 Sovereign and sure 
 Only my God, bled for my soul 
 Now I surrender all 
 Comfort is for all the hurting 
 And the kingdom for the poor 
 Mercy for the ones who show it 
 The pure in heart will see Him more 
 Holy is my God 
 Who's making all things new 
 Devoted and undone 
 I worship You

Our God will reign forever 
 And all the world will know His name 
 Everyone together sing the song of the redeemed 
 I know that my Redeemer lives 
 And now I stand on what He did 
 My Savior, my Savior lives 
 Every day a brand new chance to say 
 Jesus, You are the only way 
 My Savior, my Savior lives 
 The King has come from Heaven 
 And darkness trembles at His name 
 Victory forever is the song of the redeemed 
 I know that my Redeemer lives 
 And now I stand on what He did 
 My Savior, my Savior lives 
 Every day a brand new chance to say 
 Jesus, You are the only way 
 My Savior, my Savior lives 
 My Savior lives, my Savior lives 
 My Savior lives, my Savior lives 
 My Savior lives, my Savior lives

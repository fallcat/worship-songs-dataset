I see you hanging there 
 Blood stained and freedom in your hands 
 I see amazing grace 
 Agony and passion on your face 
 Now that I see you I know 
 Your love commands my soul 
 Now that I know you I see 
 There's no one else for me 
 I see you standing here 
 Scarred hands of hope have been revealed 
 I see you took my place 
 What was meant for me has been erased 
 Now that I see you I know 
 Your love commands my soul 
 Now that I know you I see 
 There's no one else for me 
 Open your eyes, look to the skies 
 The King of love, the King of heaven 
 Tell everyone, your daughters and sons 
 The King of love, the King of heaven

Hear the freedom sound 
 Broken chains, hit the ground 
 Now the time has come 
 Beyond ourselves to live as one 
 We worship our God 
 Only, only the one living God 
 Holy, holy, Jesus we give You our lives 
 Oh Jesus, we give You our lives 
 Raise the banner high 
 The flood of love has changed our lives 
 All the earth resound 
 Singing songs of God's renown 
 Our God is coming 
 Look to the skies, oh 
 Heaven is wide open 
 You are the Christ 
 Our God is coming

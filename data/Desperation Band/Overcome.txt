Seated above, enthroned in the Father's love 
 Destined to die, poured out for all mankind 
 God's only son perfect and spotless one 
 He never sinned, but suffered as if he did 
 All authority, every victory is Yours 
 All authority, every victory is Yours 
 Savior, worthy of honor and glory, worthy of all our praise, You overcame 
 Jesus, awesome in power forever, awesome and great is Your name, You overcame 
 Power in hand speaking the Father's plan 
 You're sending us out, light in this broken land 
 We will overcome by the blood of the Lamb 
 And the word of our testimony, everyone overcome

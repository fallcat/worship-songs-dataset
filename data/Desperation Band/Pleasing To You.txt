Sanctify me 
 Clean out my closet 
 Take away anything 
 That is not pleasing to You 
 Purify me 
 Destroy all my anger 
 Wash away everything 
 That is not pleasing to You 
 I will be white as snow 
 I will be pure as gold 
 Jesus my heart must know 
 I'm pleasing to You 
 I give my life my all 
 Taking the cross I will follow 
 Jesus my heart must know 
 I'm pleasing to You 
 Sanctify me 
 You are the light to guide me 
 To the place where I am 
 Only pleasing to You 
 Oh, come and purify me, Lord 
 I need your light inside me 
 So the darkness flees 
 And I can be pleasing to You

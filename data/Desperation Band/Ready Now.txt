You come like you promised you would 
 I want to surrender for good 
 I know that I need you 
 And I don't want to keep living life alone 
 So take my heart 
 And make it new 
 Make it true 
 And make it like you 
 Take my hands 
 I lift them high 
 They're yours not mine to do 
 Do what you will 
 Do what you will 
 Do what you will 
 I feel like a blind man in you sight 
 I know that I'm wicked in your eyes 
 So wash me and make me shine like your Son 
 I want to tell everyone 
 That you're the only one 
 So take my heart 
 And make it new 
 Make it true 
 And make it like you 
 Take my hands 
 I lift them high 
 They're yours not mine to do 
 Do what you will 
 Do what you will 
 Do what you will 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 Do what you will 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 Do what you will 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 So take my heart 
 And make it new 
 Make it true 
 And make it like you 
 Take my hands 
 I lift them high 
 They're yours not mine to do 
 Do what you will 
 Do what you will 
 Do what you will 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 Do what you will 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 Do what you will 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 Do what you will 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now 
 I'm ready now

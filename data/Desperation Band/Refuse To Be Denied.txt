I am Yours, you are mine 
 I refuse to be denied 
 All of You is my heart's cry 
 I refuse to be denied 
 I'm coming after you 
 I'm coming after you 
 I'm coming after you 
 Though I'm weak, though I'm dry 
 I refuse to be denied 
 All my life, a sacrifice 
 I refuse to be denied 
 I'm coming after you 
 I'm coming after you 
 I'm coming after you

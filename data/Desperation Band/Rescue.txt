You are the source of life 
 And I can't be left behind 
 No one else will do 
 And I will take hold of You 
 I need You Jesus to come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go? 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace, I will follow You 
 You are the source 
 You are the source of life 
 And I can't be left behind 
 No one else will do 
 And I will take hold of You 
 'Cause I need You Jesus to come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go? 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Oh, capture me with grace 
 And I need You Jesus to come to my rescue 
 Tell me, where else can I go? 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Oh, capture me with grace, I will follow You 
 I will follow You, I will follow You 
 This world has nothing for me 
 I will follow You 
 This world has nothing for me 
 I will follow You 
 This world has nothing for me 
 I'm gonna follow You 
 This world has nothing for me 
 And I need You Jesus to come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go? 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Won't You capture me with grace? 
 Lord, come and capture me with grace 
 Capture me with grace 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow You

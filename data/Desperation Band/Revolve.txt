I was lost but now I'm found 
 And my world revolves around You 
 I was far away and now 
 My world revolves around You 
 Jesus, my world without and end 
 No mind can comprehend 
 Though I keep trying 
 Jesus, my faith has found Your love 
 My hope has found its trust 
 My heart will beat the sound 
 My world revovlves around 
 Though the sky should touch the ground My world revolves around You 
 I surrender, You sourround 
 When my world revovles around You 
 Now my eyes are fixed on You 
 And I can't look away 
 Cause all this heart was made to do 
 Ias to offer highest praise 
 My praise, praise, my praise

And I was lost 
 And I was afraid until You found me 
 And You took me by the hand 
 And I was bound 
 And I was in chains 
 Until You came and set me free to dance again 
 Now, I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, oh, oh 
 You are good, I know 
 I will shout it from the rooftops 
 You are good, I know 
 That Your love will go forever 
 You are good, yeah 
 You know I was lost 
 I was lost 
 And I was afraid until You found me 
 And You took me by the hand 
 And I was bound 
 And I was in chains 
 Until You came and set me free to dance again 
 Now, I'm screaming 
 Now, I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, oh, oh 
 You are good, I know 
 I will shout it from the rooftops 
 You are good, I know 
 That Your love will go forever 
 You are good, I know 
 I will shout it from the rooftops 
 You are good, I know 
 That Your love will go forever 
 You are good, yeah 
 Yes, You are, yes, You are 
 You are good, oh, God 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I was blind 
 I was blind but now I see 
 From the rooftops I will sing 
 I was bound but now I'm free 
 I was blind 
 I was blind but now I see 
 From the rooftops I will sing 
 I was bound but now I'm free 
 I was blind, I was blind, yeah 
 I was blind but now I see 
 From the rooftops I will sing 
 I was bound but now I'm free, yeah 
 You are good, I know 
 I will shout it from the rooftops 
 You are good, I know 
 That Your love will go forever

 Forever, yeah, forever 
 Yeah, forever, and ever, and ever, forever

All of my shame You erased 
 You gave me Your beauty in its place 
 All of my sorrows You exchanged 
 For a joy that never fades 
 You are my everything 
 Everything You are is everything to me 
 You satisfy me, You satisfy me 
 With the riches of Your hand 
 Everything I am is all because of You 
 You satisfy 
 All of the things that hold my heart 
 All of the pleasures of this life 
 Cannot compare to who You are 
 And the treasures of Your love 
 You are my everything 
 Everything You are is everything to me 
 You satisfy me, You satisfy me 
 With the riches of Your hand 
 Everything I am is all because of You 
 You satisfy me, You satisfy me 
 And I lay my life down 
 My trophies and my crowns 
 All because of You 
 You satisfy

 Hidden in Jesus 
 Hope of glory 
 Living inside my life 
 In my Life 
 Hold on to your mercy 
 Seeing what you see 
 Hope of Glory

 In my Life 
 I will stand on the Solid Rock 
 I believe if I feel it or not 
 Word of God come and fill my thoughts 
 I am Yours take control 
 The enemy defeated 
 Living in freedom 
 Hope of glory 
 Living inside my life 
 In my life 
 I will stand on the Solid Rock 
 I believe if I feel it or not 
 Word of God come and fill my thoughts 
 I am Yours take control 
 Oh 
 I am standing up 
 Oh 
 On the Solid Rock 
 Oh 
 I am standing up 
 Oh 
 On the Solid Rock 
 On Christ the Solid Rock I stand 
 All other ground is sinking sand 
 On Christ the Solid Rock I stand 
 All other ground is sinking sand

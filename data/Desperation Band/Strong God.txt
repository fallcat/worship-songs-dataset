Father to the fatherless 
 Defender of the weak 
 Freedom for the prisoner 
 We sing 
 This is god in his holy place 
 This is god clothed in love and strength 
 Sing out, lift your voice and cry out 
 Awesome is our strong god, mighty is our god 
 With us in the wilderness 
 Faithful to provide 
 Every breath and every step 
 We see 
 This is god in his holy place 
 This is god clothed in love and strength 
 Sing out, lift your voice and cry out 
 Awesome is our strong god, mighty is our god 
 Sing out, raise your hands and shout out 
 Awesome is our strong god, mighty is our god 
 There is no higher, no 
 There is no greater, no 
 There is none stronger than our god 
 There is none stronger than our god 
 There is none stronger than our god 
 Sing out, lift your voice and cry out 
 Awesome is our strong god, mighty is our god 
 Sing out, raise your hands and shout out 
 Awesome is our strong god, mighty is our god 
 Mighty is our god 
 Mighty is our god

There's a place rich with life 
 Where every wave will purify 
 Take me there to be with You 
 Take me to the river 
 There's a place deep with hope 
 To saturate the weary soul 
 Take me there to be with You 
 Take me to the river 
 Lead my soul 
 To quietness and trust 
 All I know is 
 You will be enough 
 Take me to the river 
 Pull me off the shore 
 Here within Your freedom 
 I have found my reason 
 I am Yours 
 Let the water rise 
 Far above my head 
 Baptize me in wonder 
 Spirit take me under 
 Once again 
 As I wait within the swell 
 You sweep away what's of myself 
 Take me there to be with You 
 Take me to the river 
 Let the river flow 
 Let the water awaken my soul 
 From the dead come life 
 Arise, arise 
 Let it flow 
 Let it flow 
 River flow 
 River flow

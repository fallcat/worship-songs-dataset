Every morning I wake up just to find 
 Never ending mercies, You made mine 
 I can't deny the joy inside 
 You set my world in motion, God 
 And I can't stop spinning 
 Jesus, You lift me up so high 
 Above all the things that 
 I could not ever seem to leave behind 
 Now with You I cannot be stopped 
 You are living in my heart 
 Your life is taking over all of me now 
 You're taking over now 
 All around the world, let people sing 
 Of a God who set the captives free 
 Salvation is forever Yours 
 I won't stay silent anymore 
 And I can't stop singing

Who has stretched out the skies like a canvas? 
 Who has scooped up the oceans with his hands? 
 Who has measured the hills from the mountains? 
 You have 
 Who has given us beauty for ashes? 
 Who has broken the chains of the captives? 
 Who has rescued our lives with compassion? 
 You have 
 This I know, You are a great God 
 This I know, You are a great God 
 This I know, You are the one true God 
 You are a great God 
 Who is breaking the curse of injustice? 
 Who is calling the nations to Jesus? 
 Who is King of the world, let us shout it? 
 You are 
 Everlasting all consuming, burning fire 
 Glorious One, risen savior, king forever 
 Love unending, beautiful one

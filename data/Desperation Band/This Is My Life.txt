Jesus You have bought me 
 And life was the price that You paid 
 Jesus I will live for the glory of Your name 
 I will live abandoned to You 
 I will lay my life down for You 
 This is my life 
 I'm giving it to You 
 All my days every way I will praise You 
 This is my life 
 I'm living it for You 
 Oh the world will see 
 This is my life 
 Jesus You have bought me 
 And life was the price that You paid 
 Jesus I will live for the glory of Your name 
 I will live abandoned to You 
 I will lay my life down for You 
 This is my life 
 I'm giving it to You 
 All my days every way I will praise You 
 This is my life 
 I'm living it for You 
 Oh the world will see 
 This is my life 
 I will live abandon to You 
 I will lay my life down for You 
 Jesus You are the only One 
 I want to live my life for 
 Jesus I will show the world 
 How I've been sold

Until my breath runs dry, I will sing to You 
 Until the end of time, I will praise You, Lord 
 Until we finally meet and I live down at Your feet 
 You'll find me seeking You, You'll find me seeking You 
 All of my life, all of my days 
 I will worship You the same 
 I give You my heart, I give You my life 
 As a pleasing sacrifice 
 I worship You, I worship You 
 Until my breath runs dry, I will sing to You 
 Until the end of time, I will praise You, Lord 
 Until we finally meet and I live down at Your feet 
 You'll find me seeking You, You'll find me seeking You 
 All of my life, all of my days 
 I will worship You the same 
 I give You my heart, I give You my life 
 As a pleasing sacrifice 
 I worship You, I worship You 
 Until my breath runs dry, I will sing to You 
 Until the end of time, I will praise You, Lord 
 Until we finally meet and I live down at Your feet 
 You'll find me seeking You, You'll find me seeking You 
 I worship You, I worship You 
 I worship You for all my days 
 I worship You, I worship You 
 I worship You, I worship You 
 Until the end of time and I worship You 
 Until my breath runs dry, I will sing to You 
 Until the end of time, I will praise You, Lord 
 Until we finally meet and I live down at Your feet 
 You'll find me seeking You, You'll find me seeking You 
 Until my breath runs dry, I will sing to You 
 Until the end of time, I will praise You, Lord 
 Until we finally meet and I live down at Your feet 
 You'll find me seeking You, You'll find me seeking You 
 I'll seek you, Lord

Who is like You O Lord 
 God of heaven God of earth 
 There is none who compares 
 To Your majesty and love 
 From the days of my youth 
 You have led me in Your way 
 Now I'll shout out Your truth today 
 We lift You up we lift You up 
 For all to see Your glory 
 Arise O Lord and shine on us 
 Until our generation 
 Sees Your glory fall 
 You are awesome in praise 
 Doing miracles today 
 I will come and proclaim 
 All Your mighty deeds of old 
 From the days of my youth 
 You have led me in Your way 
 Now I'll shout out Your truth today 
 We lift You up we lift You up 
 For all to see Your glory 
 Arise O Lord and shine on us 
 Until our generation 
 Sees Your glory fall 
 Let Your glory fall 
 Let Your glory fall 
 We want to see You once again 
 We want to see You once again

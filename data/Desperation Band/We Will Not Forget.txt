In the valley in the shadows 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 In the quiet in the darkness 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 You have never failed us God 
 And You will never fail 
 We will not forget all Your benefits 
 We will not forget all You've done for us 
 You are for us, ever for us, God 
 We will not forget what You've brought us through 
 We're not letting go all our hope is You 
 You are mighty, ever mighty God 
 We've silenced lions, we've slayed our giants 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 We've shouted victory, we've found our liberty 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us

I won't be satisfied 
 I won't be found all right till I find 
 Who You are 
 I'd climb every mountain 
 I'd travel the deepest valley 
 To find who You are 
 You, You cause the lame to walk 
 You open lips to talk 
 You're everything and that 
 Is who You are 
 You, You calm the storms at night 
 You turn the dark to light 
 You're everything and that 
 Is who You are 
 I won't be satisfied 
 I won't be found all right till I find 
 Who You are 
 I'd climb every mountain 
 I'd travel the deepest valley 
 To find who You are 
 You, You cause the lame to walk 
 You open lips to talk 
 You're everything and that 
 Is who You are 
 You, You calm the storms at night 
 You turn the dark to light 
 You're everything and that 
 Is who You are 
 You, You cause the lame to walk 
 You open lips to talk 
 You're everything and that 
 Is who You are 
 You, You calm the storms at night 
 You turn the dark to light 
 You're everything and that 
 Is who You are 
 That is who You are 
 My savior 
 My healer 
 Redeemer 
 That is who You are 
 Creator 
 My maker 
 My father 
 That is who You are [x6] 
 That is who You are

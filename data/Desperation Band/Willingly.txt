Like the dew comes to the morning 
 We will come to You 
 Captivate us with Your beauty 
 'Til all we want is You 
 This is what we're living for 
 This is our reward 
 To see the nations worship You 
 We will give our all 
 We say yes Lord 
 We say yes Lord 
 We say yes Lord 
 We willingly come 
 From every tribe they come to You 
 And gather at Your throne 
 This is the great multitude 
 The ones You made Your own 
 This is what we're living for 
 This is Your reward 
 To see the nations worship You 
 We will give our all 
 We say yes Lord 
 We say yes Lord 
 We say yes Lord 
 We willingly come 
 I want to go where You're going, Jesus 
 I want to say what You're saying, Lord 
 I want to do what You're doing, Jesus 
 I am Yours

We will look to 
 The horizon 
 Hope is rising 
 Light has come 
 Generations 
 Joined together 
 By Your spirit 
 We are one 
 Every chain must fall 
 And every fear must bow down 
 Your freedom reigns 
 Your justice roars 
 Your people sing 
 You're the risen Lord 
 Our hearts alive 
 Our hope endures 
 In all the earth 
 There is no one so wonderful 
 Our redeemer 
 Our sure foundation 
 We're embracing 
 All You are 
 You are perfect 
 Like no other 
 Faithful Jesus 
 You are God 
 Every chain must fall 
 Every fear must bow down 
 Your freedom reigns 
 Your justice roars 
 Your people sing 
 You're the risen Lord 
 Our hearts alive 
 Our hope endures 
 In all the earth 
 There is no one so wonderful 
 Oh we're living in the light of love 
 We're living in the light of truth 
 We're living in the light of You 
 Your freedom reigns 
 Your justice roars 
 Your people sing 
 You're the risen Lord 
 Our hearts alive 
 Our hope endures 
 In all the earth 
 There is no one so wonderful

More than the air I breathe 
 You are the life I need 
 You are my King 
 You are my Lord 
 More than the praise of man 
 You are the source of all that I am 
 You are my King 
 You are my Lord 
 Salvation belongs to our God 
 Salvation belongs to our God 
 You are the glory 
 The lifter of my head 
 Your name is holy, holy 
 You are the Savior 
 My shield and righteousness 
 You are the glory, glory 
 More than security 
 You are the hope I seek 
 You are my King 
 You are my Lord 
 You heard my cry 
 And delivered me 
 So here I am 
 At Your feet 
 At Your feet

I will lay my life down to lift You up 
 Throwing down my crowns 
 To see Your face 
 I will lose myself to be found in You 
 Taking up my cross I will live again 
 You are the reason I breathe 
 And You are the one I'm living for 
 Jesus my Savior and friend 
 I'm giving all I am to follow You 
 Lord I will follow You 
 Lord I will follow You 
 Lord I will follow You 
 Lord I will follow You 
 I will lay my life down to lift You up 
 Throwing down my crowns 
 To see Your face 
 I will lose myself to be found in You 
 Taking up my cross I will live again 
 You are the reason I breathe 
 And You are the one I'm living for 
 Jesus my Savior and friend 
 I'm giving all I am to follow You 
 Lord I will follow You 
 Lord I will follow You 
 Lord I will follow You 
 Lord I will follow You

You breathed and the stars arrived 
 Matching in perfect time into the night 
 You spoke and the light appeared 
 Marking the days and years of our lives 
 You hold it all together 
 You hold it all forever 
 You hold it all, You started it all, You are my all in all 
 You loved in the greatest way 
 Giving Your life away for all that was lost 
 You conquered the enemy 
 Darkness is trembling, You are alive 
 You hold it all together 
 You hold it all forever 
 You hold it all, You started it all, You are my all in all 
 The Lord is my Light, my Salvation in life 
 I will not fear, no, I will not fear 
 The Lord is my Light, my Salvation in life 
 I will not fear, no, I will not fear 
 I will not fear, I will not fear,

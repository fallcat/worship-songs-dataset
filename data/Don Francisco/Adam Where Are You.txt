Unashamed and naked in a garden that has never seen the rain 
 Rulers of a kingdom, full of joy, never marred by any pain 
 The morning all around them seems to celebrate the life they've just begun 
 And in the majesty of innocence, the king and queen come walking in the sun 
 But the master of deception now begins with his dissection of the Word 
 And with all of his craft and subtlety, the serpent twists the simple truth they've heard 
 While hanging in the balance is a world that has been placed at their command 
 And all their unborn children die as both of them bow down to Satan's hand 
 And just before the evening, in the cool of the day 
 They hear the voice of God as He is walkin' 
 But they can't abide His presence now, so they try to hide away; 
 But still they hear the sound as He is calling: 
 "Adam, Adam, where are you? 
 Adam, Adam, where are you? 
 Adam, Adam, where are you?" 
 In the stifling heat of summer now, the gard'ner and his wife are in the field 
 And it seems that thorns and thistles are the only crops their struggles ever yield 
 He eats his meals in sorrow 'til he sinks into the dust whence he came 
 But all down through the ages, he can hear his Maker calling out his name 
 "Adam, Adam, where are you? 
 Adam, Adam, where are you?" 
 And though the curse has long be broken 
 Adam's sons are still the prisoners of their fears 
 Rushing helter skelter to destruction with their fingers in their ears 
 While the Father's voice is calling with an urgency I've never heard before 
 "Won't you come in from the darkness now, before it's time to finally close the door!" 
 "Adam, Adam, where are you? 
 Adam, Adam, where are you? 
 Adam, Adam, I love you!"

In beginning was the Word 
 And He spoke and made the world 
 Then He filled the sky with light 
 And He saw that it was good 
 Land and sea then living things 
 Teemed and swarmed and multiplied 
 And all of life lived as it should 
 And God said that it was good 
 Yes He said that it was good 
 Bird and beast and rock and wood 
 Let this truth be understood 
 All the world He made is good 
 Man and women stood serene 
 Walked with God in gardens green 
 God blessed all His hands had made 
 And called it beautiful and good 
 Sit very still and look around 
 See the colors, hear the sound 
 Let all His love come shining through 
 'Cause your Father made it all for you

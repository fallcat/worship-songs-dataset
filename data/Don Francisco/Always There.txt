Closin' the door, I leave the world behind me 
 Liftin' my hands to you 
 You’re always there 
 you’re always there 
 All of the joy that this world denies me 
 Flows from your heart every time 
 I come to you 
 Your loves shines through 
 Every time I come to you 
 You call me by name, and at the sound my soul rejoices 
 Heaven descends and your glory fills the air 
 Every prayer, every heart's desire has found its answer 
 As you tell me once again that your love will never end 
 You're my saviour; my friend that's always there 
 All through the day as your Spirit leads me 
 No matter where I go, I'm still with you 
 Though I may walk through the valley's shadow 
 I will not be afraid, 'cause you'll lead me through 
 I know that your word is true 
 And I put my trust in you 
 You call me by name, and at the sound my soul rejoices 
 Heaven descends and your glory fills the air 
 Every prayer, every heart's desire has found its answer 
 With your arms around me there, you tell me again you care 
 You're my father; my friend that's always there 
 You call me by name, and at the sound my soul rejoices 
 Heaven descends and your glory fills the air 
 Every prayer, every heart's desire has found its answer 
 With your arms around me there, you tell me again you care 
 You're my father; my friend that's always there 
 You're always there

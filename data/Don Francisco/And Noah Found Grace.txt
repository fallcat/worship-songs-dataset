From Adam and Eve, and to Lamech from Cain 
 Sin spread through the earth like a fire and a stain 
 From temptation to sin, then to death it gave birth 
 As has man wholly corrupted his way on the earth 
 But Noah was righteous in the sight of the Lord 
 Only Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord 
 The earth filled with wicked and violent men 
 Their thoughts only evil again and again 
 Till the Lord God regretted that they'd ever been made 
 And He grieved in His heart, and in anguish He said 
 "I will wipe out all life from the face of the land 
 From the fox in the forest to the snake in the sand 
 From man in his pride to the insects that creep 
 All flesh will be buried in a grave in the deep." 
 But Noah was righteous in the sight of the Lord 
 Only Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord 
 The Lord sealed the door when they all were inside 
 The floodgates were opened all over the skies 
 From deep in the earth, hidden seas joined the flood 
 Till the mountains were covered, and all flesh and blood 
 The ark floated high on the deluge alone 
 Till at last the dove left and remained where she'd flown 
 And Noah walked out with his sons and their wives 
 And there burned an offering to God for their lives 
 And so it will be when the Master returns 
 The earth and the heavens will melt and will burn 
 And it's too late to pray when it ends with a roar 
 Those who find grace will have found it before 
 And when all of it ends with a fire and a roar 
 Those who find grace will have found it before 
 Those who find grace will have found it before 
 Only Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord

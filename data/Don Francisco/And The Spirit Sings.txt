Familiar and comfortable 
 Religious tradition descends 
 No closer to God at the first 
 Than they are at the end 
 Expected experiences 
 Just as the bulletin said 
 Doctrinally pure 
 But the words were all empty and dead 
 And the Spirit grieves 
 And the Spirit grieves 
 You can tell it's professional 
 As soon as the service begins 
 Really is somethin' to see 
 An' they're packin' 'em in 
 Exciting performances in music 
 And gesture and words 
 Emotions are high 
 But beneath it all, nothing is stirred 
 And the Spirit grieves 
 And the Spirit grieves 
 You feel like you're home 
 When you walk through the living room door 
 Surrounded by friends 
 That you love, that you've been waitin' for 
 No leader is seen 
 But still people give voice as they're shown 
 All bringing the gifts 
 That the Spirit has given His own 
 Then led by the Master Himself 
 Into worship and praise 
 The Shekinah descends 
 And enfolds every heart that is raised 
 And the Spirit sings! 
 And the love of Jesus heals and flows 
 New life is born 
 And truth is preached and heard and known 
 And the Spirit sings! 
 And joy explodes around the throne 
 And the Spirit sings! 
 And the Spirit sings! 
 And the Spirit sings! 
 And the Spirit sings! 
 And the Spirit sings!

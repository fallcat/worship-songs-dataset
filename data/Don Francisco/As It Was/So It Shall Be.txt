In beginning God created 
 The heavens and the earth 
 Tho' at first they lay in formlessness 
 He knew their final worth 
 Clothed in power and majesty 
 In garments made of light 
 As darkness fled before Him, 
 He divided day from night 
 He fastened earth's foundations, 
 Laid its cornerstone 
 He shut the sea behind its doors 
 And made its bound'ries known 
 He spoke of grass and herbs and trees 
 And seeds that fall and fly 
 And roots thrust deep into the earth 
 And branches to the sky 
 The chorus of the morning stars 
 And the shouts of heaven's sons 
 Resound throughout the skyfields 
 While the work of God is done 
 And as He sows His words like jewels 
 In a rainbow falling down 
 The garden is perfection 
 And awaits creation's crown 
 Then in glory unimaginable, 
 The Lord Himself is here 
 He kneels, and there beneath His hands, 
 A man from dust appears 
 He lifts him gently in His arms, 
 And breaths into his soul 
 And raises Him to stand upright, 
 Complete and free and whole 
 The man looks round in wonder 
 At the world that's now his own 
 And everything that's touched 
 And seen is beauty yet unknown 
 With a joy that has no bounds 
 And knows no fear of end 
 Every evening in its coolness 
 He walks there with his Friend 
 The pow'r that formed the universe 
 Was but a token of His might 
 It was love that gave us ears to hear 
 And eyes to see the light 
 It's love that gave us breath 
 And it is love that gave us birth 
 It's love that flung the stars 
 And it is love that spins the earth 
 And when at last this vastness 
 Like a worn-out robe is rolled 
 And the new creation's children 
 Watch their heart's desires unfold 
 Then love will reign forever 
 Through our God and King and Friend 
 And as it was in the beginning, 
 It shall be without end 
 And as it was in the beginning 
 It shall be without end 
 And as it was in the beginning 
 It shall be without end

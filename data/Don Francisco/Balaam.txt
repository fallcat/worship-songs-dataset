Balaam was a prophet about the time that Moses was coming through 
 And every now and again God'd speak to him and tell him what to say and do 
 He had a reputation in all those parts for bein' on the line of power 
 And when Moab's king heard Moses was comin' he called him in his needy hour 
 He said, "Balaam come and curse these Israelites 
 If you do I believe I could beat 'em in a fight!" 
 But when Balaam asked the Lord, the Lord said, "Balaam don't you go 
 Israel is blessed by Me, don't you go mess up My show" 
 But Balaam's head was turned by the money he could earn 
 So he saddled up his donkey anyway 
 Balaam and his servants hurried off for the King of Moab's castle 
 But they hadn't gone very far down the road when the whole trip became a hassle 
 Because the donkey ran off across a field, then she nearly broke Balaam's ankle 
 But when she lay right down and wouldn't get up Balaam got a little more than rankled 
 For the third time Balaam beat her with his cane 
 But that donkey just refused to move again 
 It was the thing that happened next though, that made Balaam's knees get weak 
 Well, that donkey still would not get up but she began to speak 
 She said, "Balaam you're to blame, the way you beat me is a shame 
 'Cause all I've done is tried to save your life!" 
 Then the Angel of the Lord appeared with a flamin' sword in his hand 
 Balaam fell down on his face, a very frightened man 
 The Angel said, "Balaam, you'd be dead if your donkey hadn't detected 
 That I was waitin' there to part your hair when you and my sword connected" 
 Balaam then repented for his sin 
 And he promised not to act like that again 
 And I hope he learned his lesson about God's reward for greed 
 But you know it's that talkin' donkey that's really strange indeed 
 Now that donkey's just a donkey but she's still the thing God used 
 And that's the point I want you all to see 
 The Lord's the one who makes the choice of the instrument He's usin' 
 We don't know the reasons and the plans behind His choosin' 
 So when the Lord starts usin' you don't you pay it any mind 
 He 'could have used the dog next door if He'd been so inclined

Crowds were in the streets that day 
 When Jesus came to town 
 All the synagogue was there 
 And more from miles around 
 So I asked Him home to dinner 
 So I could see what I could see 
 Of this famous local Prophet 
 From here in Galilee 
 And I don't know just how that woman 
 Got into the room 
 But you couldn't miss her gaudy clothes 
 And her strong and sweet perfume 
 She went straight to Jesus' feet 
 And stopped and stood right there 
 And then cried and wet His feet with tears 
 And dried them with her hair 
 Now of all the women in my town 
 None was more well known 
 For the flagrant scent she'd left them 
 And the wickedness she'd sown 
 But He didn't move to stop her 
 It seemed this Prophet couldn't tell 
 That the woman who was touching Him 
 Was the kind they buy and sell 
 And I had no idea just what this Jesus planned to do 
 When He said Simon, there's somethin' I need to say to you 
 So I said, Teacher, if it's on Your mind then tell me what you will 
 But as He began to speak to me, the room grew quickly still 
 He said, take a good look at this woman now 
 In spite of all her fears, 
 She's kissed me, and anointed me 
 And washed my feet with tears 
 She's honored me 
 And you've been only rude to me instead 
 You gave no kiss of greeting 
 And no anointing for my head 
 And her sins were red as scarlet 
 But now they're washed away 
 The love and faith she'd shown 
 Is the price she has to pay 
 For the depth of God's forgiveness 
 It's more than you can see 
 And in spite of what you think of her 
 She's beautiful to me 
 Well my anger flamed to hatred 
 I wanted nothing more 
 Than to take this Prophet by the throat 
 And throw Him out the door 
 To act like God, forgiving sins 
 And then speak so to me 
 As itinerant from Nazareth 
 And backwards Galilee 
 But instead I sat and trembled 
 Shaken to the core, 
 The woman still was weeping 
 As she knelt there on the floor 
 Jesus turned to her 
 Said your chains have been released 
 Your faith has saved you from your sins 
 Rise and walk in peace 
 Your sins were red as scarlet 
 But now they're washed away 
 The love and faith you've shown 
 Is all the price you have to pay 
 For the depth of God's forgiveness 
 It's deeper than the sea 
 And no matter what the world may think 
 You're beautiful to me 
 Your sins were red as scarlet 
 But now they're washed away 
 The love and faith you've shown 
 Is all the price you have to pay 
 For the depth of God's forgiveness 
 It's deeper than the sea 
 And no matter what the world may think 
 You're beautiful to me 
 Your sins were red as scarlet 
 But now they're washed away 
 The love and faith you've shown 
 Is all the price you have to pay 
 For the depth of God's forgiveness 
 It's deeper than the sea 
 And no matter what the world may think 
 You're beautiful to me

I walked alone 
 Before the crowd 
 Made my stand 
 I've cried aloud 
 I'm just a slave 
 Unworthy hire 
 I've only washed off 
 Earthly mire 
 I'm not the one 
 The world awaits 
 But now he's here 
 He's at the gates 
 He will baptise 
 Your soul entire 
 With heavenly power 
 With holy fire 
 The sun arose 
 The morning clear 
 I watched him walk 
 His steps drew near 
 I whispered, "Lo 
 This cannot be 
 You are the one 
 To baptise me." 
 He smiled and said 
 "Relax, my friend 
 It's been ordained 
 To thus begin." 
 The Spirit's voice 
 Confirmed inside 
 So to all around I cried 
 Behold the Lamb 
 Of God 
 Behold the Lamb 
 Of God 
 Behold the Lamb 
 Of God 
 Who takes away the sin 
 Of all the world 
 This is the truth 
 I testify 
 I've seen not only 
 With my eyes 
 The Spirit came 
 A shining dove 
 On silver wings 
 From high above 
 And settled down 
 Upon him there 
 The Father's voice 
 Filled all the air 
 "You're my delight 
 Since times begun 
 My beloved 
 My only Son." 
 Behold the Lamb 
 Of God 
 Behold the Lamb 
 Of God 
 Behold the Lamb 
 Of God 
 Who takes away the sin 
 Of all the world 
 Who takes away the sin 
 Who takes away the sin 
 Who takes away the sin

Bird with broken wing 
 Locked up inside 
 A tiny cage 
 Till the day I heard your cry 
 And set you free 
 But as I reached in 
 To heal the hurt 
 You fled in wild dismay 
 Now your pain 
 Has made you blind as you can be 
 Echoes in the distance 
 Are almost all you hear from me 
 Each time I speak your name 
 You flee away 
 While the agonies of mindless flight 
 Grow more than you can bare 
 Still you think it's because of me 
 That you feel this way 
 Soarin' far above the storm 
 On wings spread strong and wide 
 Is the vision that you've buried 
 In despair 
 You dash yourself against the stones 
 And flutter terrified 
 When my love will heal your wounds 
 And lift you there 
 Like a frightened child 
 Who starts away with every move 
 You want to trust 
 But watch so fearfully 
 Everything you're longing for 
 Is here within my hands 
 I'm waiting now for you 
 To come to me 
 Soarin' far above the storm 
 On wings spread strong and wide 
 Is the vision that you've buried 
 In despair 
 You dash yourself against the stones 
 And flutter terrified 
 When my love will heal your wounds 
 And lift you there 
 Like a frightened child 
 Who starts away with every move 
 You want to trust 
 But watch so fearfully 
 Everything you're longing for 
 Is here within my hands 
 I'm waiting now for you 
 To come to me 
 I'm waiting now for you 
 To come to me 
 I'm waiting now for you 
 To come to me

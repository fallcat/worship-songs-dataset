Pride filled my heart 
 And I turned from your mercy 
 And then, crushed by the burden 
 I admitted my sin 
 Then you forgave me 
 Erased all my sorrows 
 And gave me the joy 
 Of your salvation again 
 Blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are forgiven 
 Oh, Blessed is the man 
 Where God sees no wrong 
 Blessed is the man 
 Who cries out to Jesus 
 Blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are all gone 
 Some men are like horses 
 That lack understanding 
 Without bit and bridle 
 They run to and fro 
 Blessed is the man 
 Who's confessed his transgression 
 I lead him and guide him 
 In the way he should go 
 So blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are forgiven 
 Oh, blessed is the man 
 Where God sees no wrong 
 Blessed is the man 
 Cries out to Jesus 
 Blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are all gone 
 Blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are forgiven 
 Oh, blessed is the man 
 God sees no wrong 
 Blessed is the man 
 Cries out to Jesus 
 Blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are all gone 
 Oh, blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are forgiven 
 Oh, blessed is the man 
 Where God sees no wrong 
 Blessed is the man 
 Cries out to Jesus 
 Blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are all gone 
 Oh, blessed is the man 
 Whose sins are all gone

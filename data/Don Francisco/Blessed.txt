You're blessed to able to see 
 The depths of your poverty 
 You're blessed when you sorrow and mourn 
 For a life that's been stilled 
 You're blessed when you're gentle and kind 
 When you love with no guile in your mind 
 And when you hunger and thirst after righteousness 
 'Til you've been filled 
 You're blessed showing mercy to all 
 Whoever have stumbled to fall 
 You're blessed to be pure in your heart 
 Though surrounded by crime 
 You're blessed bringing peace to both sides 
 Pouring oil on the waters of pride 
 You're blessed when they hate you 
 Simply because you are mine 
 For the word that I've spoken endures 
 The kingdom of heaven is yours 
 The world of your visions and dreams 
 You will finally see 
 You'll look at me then face-to-face 
 Fearless and robed in my grace 
 Forever my sons and my daughters, joyful and free 
 You're the salt that keeps evil at bay 
 The light that sends darkness away 
 You're the witness that stands at my stead 
 In the presence of men 
 So let the Spirit I've given you flow 
 Let the light that's inside of you show 
 So you'll glorify God in your deeds 
 'Til I come back again 
 Let them see me in your life 
 'Til I come back again

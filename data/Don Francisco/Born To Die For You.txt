Jesus was born to die for you 
 Jesus was born to die for you 
 Left his glory, left his throne 
 To buy you back and to bring you home 
 Jesus – he was born to die for you 
 Now, Jesus was crucified for you 
 Jesus was crucified for you 
 Took your sin, took your shame 
 Died your death to clear your name 
 Jesus – he was crucified for you 
 Jesus, he rose up from the dead 
 Jesus, he rose up from the dead 
 He rose to bring your soul release 
 To give you righteousness and peace 
 Jesus – he rose up from the dead 
 No power in this whole world could hold him down 
 No devil, and no soldiers standing round 
 And the victory he won, you know 
 He won it just for you 
 All it takes is asking, believing that it's true 
 Good God! 
 Jesus, he's Lord of heaven and earth 
 Jesus, he's Lord of heaven and earth 
 He's the only man who beat the grave 
 He's got power to heal, set free and save 
 Jesus – he's Lord of heaven and earth 
 No power in this round world could him down 
 No devil, and no soldiers standing round 
 And the victory he won, you know 
 He won it just for you 
 All it takes is asking, believing that it's true 
 Jesus was born to die for you 
 Jesus was born to die for you 
 Left his glory, left his throne 
 To buy you back and to bring you home 
 Jesus – he was born to die for you

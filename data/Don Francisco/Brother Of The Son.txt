Jesus, all I want to do is follow 
 Give away the love You give to me 
 To shine a light in someone else's darkness 
 To say the words they need to hear to set them free 
 Take this heart of stone and make it over 
 For all my life it's all I have to give 
 Fill it with your love and understanding 
 Show me how to feel and how to live 
 Father, let your Spirit flow inside me 
 'Til all that will not praise You is undone 
 Help me keep my feet upon the highway 
 And grow to be a brother of the Son 
 When at last the Book of Life is opened 
 And accounts of all Your servants have been shown 
 Lord, let me bring somebody with me 
 And stand with all my friends before the throne 
 Father, let your Spirit flow inside me 
 'Til all that will not praise You is undone 
 Help me keep my feet upon the highway 
 And grow to be a brother of the Son

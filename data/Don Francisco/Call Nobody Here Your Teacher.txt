Call nobody here your teacher, child 
 My anointing shouldn't be defiled. 
 Let the heart I gave be free and wild 
 You come follow Me 
 Woven words that make a lie 
 Webs to capture and control 
 Like a net that's thrown on high 
 Settles down upon the soul 
 So when you see them set the snare 
 Spread your wings and fly away 
 A cage awaits you there 
 Freedom's in the words I say 
 Call nobody here your leader, child 
 Flesh and spirit can't be reconciled 
 Let the heart I gave be free and wild 
 You come follow Me 
 (instrumental) 
 Twisted systems that devour 
 Pyramids without a friend 
 Crushing hearts for pride and power 
 Words with nothing to defend 
 Leave it all and rise above 
 Where my grace shines bright and fair 
 Far beyond the strife of tongues 
 I will always meet you there 
 Call nobody here your father, child 
 My anointing mustn't be defiled 
 Let the heart I gave be free and wild 
 You come follow Me 
 Call nobody here your teacher, child 
 My anointing shouldn't be defiled. 
 Let the heart I gave be free and wild 
 You come follow Me 
 Let the heart I gave be free and wild 
 You come follow Me.

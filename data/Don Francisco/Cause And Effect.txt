The old man shook his head and said 
 Now, just a minute son 
 Are you sayin' that this risin' from the dead 
 Is really done? 
 Now I'm all for love and peace 
 But you just pushed this thing too far 
 I've been around enough to know 
 It's not the way things are 
 It defies the laws of nature 
 It confounds the mind of man 
 It draws everything I know 
 Up in the air 
 If your Jesus really conquered death 
 Well, I'm not sure where I'd stand 
 Does it mean there is a God who really cares? 
 And for all these years I've lived like He's not there 
 I said, our Father's love for us 
 Is so great that He shed 
 The priceless blood of His eternal Son 
 The power of our Creator raised Christ Jesus from the dead 
 The evidence is there to inspect 
 It's just supernatural cause and effect 
 The old man shot a glance 
 Like somethin' long asleep was stirred 
 He stared into the sunset 
 Long before he said a word 
 Could it be that I have made my heart so hard 
 My eyes can't see? 
 The simple truth before me 
 Is that God just may love me 
 It defies the laws of nature 
 It confounds the mind of man 
 It drew all I thought I knew 
 Up in the air 
 But if Jesus really conquered death 
 I know where I want to stand 
 It means there is a God who really cares 
 And I'd give Him all I am if He was there 
 I said, our Father's love for us 
 Is so great that He shed 
 The priceless blood of His eternal son 
 The power of our Creator raised Christ Jesus from the dead 
 The evidence is there to inspect 
 It's just supernatural cause and effect 
 It's just supernatural cause and effect

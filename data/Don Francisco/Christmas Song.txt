At the center of the ages, 
 The Lord talks with a girl, 
 And by the words He speaks, 
 He gives a Savior to the world. 
 The time grows to its fullness, 
 And Mary's Son is born – 
 The promise's fullfilment 
 Lies asleep now in her arms 
 He didn't come to terrify, 
 To judge or condescend; 
 To call us all His servants, 
 But to lift us as His friends; 
 To save us all from Satan's power, 
 To reign at his right hand – 
 When, once for all eternity, 
 God became a man. 
 Today the God of majesty 
 Has given to the earth 
 A gift of such magnificence 
 We could never plumb its worth; 
 And the rudeness of the setting 
 Just ignites the jewel's fire: 
 A pearl beyond the greatest price 
 The joy of man's desire.

 To reign at his right hand – 
 When, once for all eternity, 
 God became a man. 
 Once for all eternity, 
 God became a man.

Well, a woman with a burden of sickness twelve years 
 Heard that Jesus was coming her way; 
 She didn't stop to worry 'bout her doubts and her fears 
 She had to fight for every step of the way 
 Through the crowds that were pressing around Him 
 Through the heat and the dust of the road, 
 And when she touched his cloak, God healed her body 
 He lifted her heavy load 
 If I can get a little closer to Jesus 
 Just a little bit closer to Jesus 
 Just a little bit closer to Jesus 
 Everything's gonna be all right 
 Now a man asked Jesus' disciples 
 If they could deliver his only son 
 From a spirit that threw him into water and fire 
 But with them it just could not be done 
 So he called out to Jesus saying "Lord I believe 
 Help me in my unbelief!" 
 Jesus had mercy, He healed his son 
 He took away all of his grief 
 If I can get a little closer to Jesus 
 Just a little bit closer to Jesus 
 Just a little bit closer to Jesus 
 Everything's gonna be all right 
 Now the story 'bout touching the hem of His garment 
 Nearly everybody knows 
 But that woman was healed by her faith in God 
 And not by Jesus's clothes 
 And the boy with the unclean spirit was delivered 
 When everybody's faith was gone 
 When his father cried out, saying "Lord I'm weak!" 
 And Jesus made his weakness strong! 
 If I can get a little closer to Jesus 
 Just a little bit closer to Jesus 
 Just a little bit closer to Jesus 
 Everything's gonna be all right 
 Now if you want to get a little closer to Jesus 
 There's nobody to stand in your way 
 You don't have to wait for another disciple 
 To find the right words to say 
 'Cause He is the same, today and forever 
 No matter what the Devil may do 
 And if you need a little faith or some more of God's Spirit 
 Just ask Him and He'll give it to you 
 And you can get a little closer to Jesus 
 Just as close as you want to to Jesus 
 Get a whole lot closer to Jesus 
 Everything's gonna be all right 
 And you can get a little closer to Jesus 
 Just as close as you want to to Jesus 
 Get a whole lot closer to Jesus 
 Everything's gonna be all right

We all got together when we heard the bad news 
 Came all this way just to help with your blues 
 We're wise and we're righteous, we know what to say 
 And it's obvious you're someone who's been losing his way 
 Now we've heard you complain, and it's clear you don't know 
 There's a spiritual law that says you reap what you sow 
 Now grief is your harvest and there's nowhere to run 
 So why don't you confess to all the evil you've done? 
 We'll give you cold comfort tho' we say we're your friends 
 We don't know what you've done but still we're sure that you've sinned 
 We'll give you cold comfort 'cause we've made up our minds 
 And when you know that you're right there ain't no need to be kind 
 Even if you're ignorant of what you did wrong 
 We can pile on some guilt - yes, we can help you along 
 If death, loss, and sickness still have not made a dent 
 We'll beat you with our words until you fin'lly repent 
 We'll give you cold comfort tho' we say we're your friends 
 You've been tried and convicted and we know that you've sinned 
 We'll give you cold comfort 'cause we've made up our minds 
 And when you know that you're right there ain't no need to be kind 
 We all got together when we heard the bad news 
 Came all of this way just to help with your blues 
 We're wise and we're righteous and we know what to say 
 It's obvious you're someone who's been losin' his way.

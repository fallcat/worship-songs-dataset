Me and Andrew 
 We'd been fishin' 
 The best part 
 Of last night 
 We caught nothin' 
 For all our tryin' 
 Come the mornin' 
 And the light 
 And I saw Him 
 And He asked me 
 To take Him out 
 A little ways from the land 
 He was teachin' 
 All the people 
 They listened there 
 In silence on the sand 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me 
 When He'd ended 
 All His teachin' 
 He turned around 
 And spoke again to me 
 He said Simon, 
 Go out farther 
 Drop your nets, once again 
 Into the sea 
 And I said, Master 
 We've been workin' 
 Since the sundown 
 Yesterday 
 But one more time 
 I'll throw them over 
 Just because 
 It's You who say 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me 
 Follow me, follow me 
 James and John 
 They're both my witnesses 
 To the truth 
 In what I've told 
 And how our nets 
 Were filled to bursting 
 More than both 
 Our boats could ever hold 
 And I fell down 
 There before me 
 Cryin', leave me Lord 
 I'm full o' sin 
 He said, Simon, 
 Don't be frightened 
 Follow me, 
 You will learn to fish for men 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow 
 Come and follow me

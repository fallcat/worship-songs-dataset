Come away, come away 
 Into quiet and trust, come away 
 Come away, come away 
 In repentance and rest, come away 
 For the heavens are telling the glory of God 
 The works of His hands teach His ways 
 The night reveals knowledge, we must understand 
 His invisible nature, is explained through the days 
 Come away, come away, 
 Into quiet and trust, come away 
 Come away, come away, 
 In repentance and rest, come away 
 For the Lord of creation is calling you now 
 To a place where the thief has no key 
 Where the Father has treasure that cannot be lost 
 And the love of the Spirit of grace sets you free 
 Come away, come away, 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Come away, come away, 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Come away, come away, 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Come away, come away 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 Come away, come away 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Come away, come away 
 Into quiet and trust, come away 
 Come away, come away 
 In repentance and rest, come away 
 For heaven's are telling the glory of God 
 The works of His hands teach His way 
 The night reveals knowledge, we must understand 
 His invisible nature is explained through the day 
 Come away, come away 
 ----Come away, come away 
 ------------------------ 
 The rhythm of the city 
 An emotionless machine 
 Manufactured in reality 
 Shining but unclean 
 Built on sand and fantasy 
 Mirror of mirage 
 Reflected by the silver screen 
 Of chrome in the garage 
 Vision blocked by concrete 
 Callused hearts encased 
 Deafened by the drum beat 
 Tongues too seared to taste 
 Masked by thrum of engines 
 And the chatter of the screen 
 The still small voice is buried 
 The footpath isn't seen 
 Images and idols 
 Technologically divised 
 Words of cotton candy 
 That dissolve before your eyes 
 Intellect and science 
 Worshipped by decree 
 Giving credit to illusion 
 So the chains believe they're free 
 Fundamental skeletons 
 In self appointed roles 
 Clothed in robes of office 
 But carnivorous of souls 
 Speaking words that come from knowledge 
 But do not come from light 
 Letter lacking spirit 
 Adding darkness to the night

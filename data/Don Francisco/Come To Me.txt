Come to me 
 All you who labour 
 Come to me 
 If too hard is your road 
 Come to me 
 If your burden is heavy 
 I'll give you rest from the load 
 In the days when I walked there among you 
 Like today, there were few who could see 
 They buried their noses in Moses' words 
 Though I called, they would not come to me 
 Now religion still muffles my Spirit 
 Tradition has vetoed my Word 
 The devices of men have descended again 
 Like a net that's thrown over a bird 
 Come to me 
 All you who labour 
 Come to me 
 If too hard is your road 
 Come to me 
 If your burden is heavy 
 I'll give you rest from the load 
 My words are dismissed and distorted 
 Rearranged to bind and control 
 My sheep are enslaved and indebted 
 Left hanging, in doubt for their souls 
 But you'll hear if you'll step out and listen 
 You'll see when your heart takes a look 
 For my life's not contained in commandments 
 My word's so much more than a book 
 So, come to me 
 All you who labour 
 Come to me 
 If too hard is your road 
 Come to me 
 If your burden is heavy 
 I'll give you rest from the load 
 Come, let me walk here beside you 
 Learn how to live just for me 
 My heart is gentle and lowly 
 And the life that I offer is free 
 If the weight of religion's too heavy 
 If you're weary and tired of the fight 
 It's all just manmade, so make me a trade 
 For my load is easy and light 
 Come to me 
 All you who labour 
 Come to me 
 If too hard is your road 
 Come to me 
 If your burden is heavy 
 I'll give you rest from the load 
 Come to me 
 All you who labour 
 Come to me 
 If too hard is your road 
 Come to me 
 If your burden is heavy 
 I'll give you rest from the load 
 I'll give you rest from the load

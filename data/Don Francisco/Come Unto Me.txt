You that have heard my voice 
 You know the sound 
 You have not lost the way 
 You have been found 
 The door's standing open wide 
 It's warm in the light 
 Life beyond dreams inside 
 Shining so bright 
 Come unto me, come unto me, 
 I'll be your shelter, come unto me. 
 The world still is grinding on 
 But faith has not failed 
 Hirelings have come and gone 
 But love has prevailed 
 I'm still you're father, you are my own. 
 Your shield and your shepherd 
 You're never alone. 
 Come unto me, come unto me, 
 I'll be your shelter, come unto me. 
 No one can steal the life 
 Placed in my care 
 Sometimes the hardest part's 
 Just remembering I'm there 
 But through light and through darkness 
 There's a cloud and a flame 
 The still small and quiet voice 
 Calling your name. 
 Come unto me, come unto me, 
 I'll be your shelter, come unto me. 
 Come unto me, come unto me, 
 I'll be your shelter, come unto me. 
 I'll be your shelter, come unto me.

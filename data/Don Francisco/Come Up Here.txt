As Paul foretold, the wolves have come and scattered us away 
 And rising up among us, others stole and led astray 
 Now counterfeits of godliness broadcast and televise 
 And drive away the hungry from the only bread that really satisfies 
 "We're followers of 'that one'; we belong to 'this'," we say 
 While any of ten thousand other names divide the way 
 So we stay distracted in our small religious games 
 Partitioned from the one whose name is far beyond all other names 
 Still in every heart that's ever known the Father's Son 
 The Spirit of the living Christ abisdes to make us one 
 And as the day approaches, all who've tried to interfere 
 Are left behind as Jesus calls, a voice we've always known and long to hear 
 Come up here, when you have learned there is no other voice to heed 
 Come up here, where you'll discover what I mean by 'free indeed' 
 Come up here and sit beside me; come up here and share my throne 
 Come up here where there is no-one between me and my own 
 Today in every heart that's ever known the Father's Son 
 The Spirit of the living Christ abides and makes us one 
 And as the day approaches, love awakens in his bride 
 As she hears him gently calling, "Come away, now;come aside 
 Come away, now; come aside; come away, now; come aside." 
 Come up here, when you have learned there is no other voice to heed 
 Come up here, where you'll discover what I mean by 'free indeed' 
 Come up here and sit beside me; come up here and share my throne 
 Come up here where there is no-one in between me and my own 
 Come up here, when you have learned there is no other voice to heed 
 Come up here, where you'll discover what I mean by 'free indeed' 
 Come up here and sit beside me; come up here and share my throne 
 Come up here where there is no-one in between me and my own 
 Come up here where there is no-one in between me and my own

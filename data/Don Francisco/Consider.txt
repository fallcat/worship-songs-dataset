Consider the flowers in the field 
 Turn your thoughts to the birds in the air 
 Your Father loves you more than all of these 
 So do not let your heart be filled with care 
 Now, a mountain meadow's flowers in the sunshine 
 Can fill the senses full and flood the soul 
 The best designer fashions on the planet 
 Are rags to what a single rose unfolds 
 If God will give such glory to the grasses 
 That in hours will just dry up and fade away 
 Don't you think he'll clothe his own beloved children 
 In what they need for every changing day? 
 So consider the flowers in the field 
 Turn your thoughts to the birds in the air 
 Your Father loves you more than all of these 
 So do not let your heart be filled with care 
 The freedom of the birds is stuff we dream of 
 To soar among the clouds and ride the wind 
 They never sow or reap or store for Winter 
 And yet your Father feeds and cares for them 
 Pocket change will buy them in the market 
 While the blood of God's own Son was paid for you 
 How is it that you worry for tomorrow 
 And doubt that what he said is what he'll do 
 So consider the flowers in the field 
 Turn your thoughts to the birds in the air 
 Your Father loves you more than all of these 
 So do not let your heart be filled with care 
 Moths and rust and man steal earthly riches 
 But kingdom treasure these can't touch at all 
 Where your treasure is, your heart will follow 
 To heaven, or to Mammon's empty halls 
 For the eye that's fixed on money stares at darkness 
 'Til darkness fills the mind and body whole 
 You can only serve one Lord and Master 
 Either God or Mammon owns your soul 
 So consider the flowers in the field 
 Turn your thoughts to the birds in the air 
 Your Father loves you more than all of these 
 So do not let your heart 
 Never let your heart 
 Do not let your heart be filled with care

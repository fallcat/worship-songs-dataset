Times just grains of sand 
 Blown out of sight by winds of change 
 Was it done by a man alone? 
 Destined to remain 
 Our own desires deceive us 
 And pervert the best made plans 
 Wickedness and desperation 
 Meets the heart of man 
 Boats without an anchor 
 Ships without a sail 
 Alone by doubt and circumstance 
 Too far gone to bail 
 Why go past the harbor? 
 Why ignore the light? 
 Sailing on an endless sea 
 To vanish in the night 
 If ya build with the crooked cornerstone 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 If a ship goes down in heavy seas 
 How're we gonna get to land? 
 What're ya gonna do when the river rises? 
 And your house is on the sand 
 If ya build with the crooked cornerstone 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 Sit and watch the river 
 While the flood is risin' high 
 The refuge of the race upstream 
 The flotsam of the light 
 Mansions on the riverside 
 Shanties on the pier 
 All the ones who told themselves 
 It'll never happen here 
 If ya build with the crooked cornerstone 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 If a ship goes down in heavy seas 
 How're we gonna get to land? 
 And what're ya gonna do when the river rises? 
 And your house is on the sand 
 If ya build with the crooked cornerstone 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 If ya build with the crooked cornerstone 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 If a ship goes down in heavy seas 
 How're we gonna get to land? 
 And what're ya gonna do when the river rises? 
 And your house is on the sand 
 If ya build with the crooked cornerstone 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 How're you gonna make it stand? 
 How're you gonna make it stand?

And as I turned to see 
 The voice that spoke to me 
 Before me I see seven golden lampstands 
 And the Lord, the Son of Man 
 In the midst of them he stands 
 His head and hair were white as snow 
 And from his eyes, a searing fire 
 His voice is like the torrents 
 As they roar 
 His right hand holds seven stars 
 The words his speaks are razor swords 
 And his face is shining like the sun 
 And when I beheld him, I fell like a dead man 
 At this feet 
 But then he knelt 
 And I felt his hand upon me 
 And he said to me 
 "Do not be afraid 
 I am the first, I am the last 
 I was dead, but now behold and see 
 I am alive and forever I will be 
 These things are true, as ever true shall be 
 The keys of Hades and of death belong to me 
 I am alive and forever I will be 
 Do not be afraid 
 Do not be afraid 
 I am the first, I am the last 
 I was dead, but now behold and see 
 I am alive and forever I will be 
 These things are true, as ever true shall be 
 The keys of Hades and of death belong to me 
 I am alive and forever I will be 
 Do not be afraid 
 Do not be afraid 
 Do not be afraid

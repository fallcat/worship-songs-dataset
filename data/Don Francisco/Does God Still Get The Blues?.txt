Way back in the beginning 
 Long before God gave the law 
 He looked down on us from heaven 
 Sin was all He saw 
 Cause everyone was evil 
 The whole race had gone insane 
 The Bible says it grieved Him 
 And His heart was filled with pain 
 Before Jesus raised up Lazarus 
 When all his friends were standin' 'round 
 Jesus hurt inside so badly 
 When all the tears were comin' down 
 Lookin' out over Jerusalem 
 Was just days before He died 
 The pain kept gettin' deeper 
 Until He broke down and cried 
 And sometimes I wonder 
 When I think of all the sin we choose 
 He looks down on all this twisted world 
 Does God still get the blues? 
 Even when we break His heart 
 I believe He keeps it to Himself 
 He knows most of us are so full o' guilt 
 He won't add on somethin' else 
 He just keeps on, keeps on givin' 
 All His blessings from above 
 Waiting for the moment 
 We'll return some of His love 
 And sometimes I wonder 
 (Ooh, sometimes I wonder) 
 Think of all the gifts we refuse 
 (Ooh, sometimes I wonder) 
 When He looked down on us from heaven 
 Does God still get the blues? 
 (Does God still get the blues?) 
 Jesus gave His life, His word and His name 
 To me and you 
 Restin' in the Holy Spirit 
 Is really that we need to do 
 But instead we prefer our traditions 
 And we all tell Him that He lied 
 And we claim Him for our misery 
 Our blindness and our pride 
 And sometimes I wonder 
 (Ooh, sometimes I wonder) 
 When I see, I see the God-less lives we choose 
 Just how much we grieve the Spirit 
 Does God still get the blues? 
 (Does God still get the blues?) 
 And sometimes I wonder 
 (Ooh, don't ya wonder?) 
 When I see the lives of the abused 
 (Ooh, don't ya wonder?) 
 Just how much we grieved His Holy Spirit 
 Does God still get the blues? 
 (Does God still get the blues?)

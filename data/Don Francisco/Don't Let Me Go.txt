Lord you know there seems to be 
 The good and bad, the two of me 
 One man knows eternity 
 The other knows the dust 
 And in the war between the two 
 The old man rails against the new 
 My flesh says not to look to you 
 My Spirit knows I must 
 Lord, I'm glad you are a man 
 Who knows the pain, who understands 
 The struggle in my soul demands 
 More strength than I possess 
 Don't let me go, you know I'll wander if I can 
 Without your love, temptation's more than I can stand 
 Lord, hear my cry, I'm tired of trying on my own 
 I'm standing face to face with truth I should have known 
 A cross is more than I can carry all alone 
 Lord you know that in my mind 
 I've tried to see, but still I'm blind 
 To living life as you've defined 
 Please help me understand 
 This place that you have brought me to 
 To die in order to renew 
 The fires that forge my ties to you 
 My heart is in your hands 
 So now I lift a prayer to you 
 Lord, help this wandering heart be true 
 To all that you have called me to 
 Until my race is run 
 Don't let me go, you know I'll wander if I can 
 Without your love, temptation's more than I can stand 
 Lord, hear my cry, I'm tired of trying on my own 
 I'm standing face to face with truth I should have known 
 A cross is more than I can carry all alone

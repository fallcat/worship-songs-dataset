So you've heard the good news 
 But you're takin' it easy and slow 
 So many pleasures and a life full of leisure 
 That ya really don't wanna let go 
 You're thinkin' that later 
 You'll get your life straighter 
 And then you'll let Jesus come in 
 But if you're dodgin' the light 
 And you're takin' the night 
 You're gonna die in your guilt and your sin 
 I don't wanna be late 
 When it's time to go 
 I don't wanna be hidin' 
 When it's time to show 
 I don't wanna be sleepin' 
 When the trumpets blow 
 And if you miss that train 
 Well, there ain't but one place to go 
 Well, you've been foolin' 
 And coolin' it 
 And seekin' you a separate peace 
 Closin' your eyes and your ears 
 To the cries of the people Jesus died to release 
 You think you got your salvation 
 So your situation is all that you have on your mind 
 But if you're still sleepin' when the angels start reapin' 
 We're all gonna leave you behind 
 I don't wanna be late 
 When it's time to go 
 I don't wanna be hidin' 
 When it's time to show 
 I don't wanna be sleepin' 
 When the trumpets blow 
 And if you miss that train 
 Well, there ain't but one place to go 
 I don't wanna be late 
 When it's time to go 
 I don't wanna be hidin' 
 When it's time to show 
 I don't wanna be sleepin' 
 When the trumpets blow 
 And if you miss that train 
 Don't say I didn't tell ya so

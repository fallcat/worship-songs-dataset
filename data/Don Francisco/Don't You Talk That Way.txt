Now, once a man who'd lived his life in blindness 
 Was healed as Jesus Christ was passing by 
 He sent him to the waters of Siloam 
 To wash the clay he'd placed upon his eyes 
 When the Pharisees demanded how it happened 
 He told them, Jesus made this clay, and now I see 
 When they call the Lord a filthy, evil sinner 
 The man stood up and said this cannot be 
 And don't you talk that way about my healer 
 The things you say, you just cannot defend 
 Don't you talk that way about my saviour 
 Don't you talk that way about my friend 
 Now, once I did not have the things I needed 
 And I asked someone to join with me and pray 
 But instead of going with me to the Father 
 He told me words that darkened down the day 
 He said, God is far above the things you long for 
 So just put to death those things you think you need 
 For there will be no answer to your calling 
 Only greater men than you will heaven heed 
 And I said, Don't you talk that way about my Father 
 He cares for every little bird that flies 
 Don't you talk that way about my saviour 
 Even I am Jesus' brother in his eyes 
 Now the news is full of terror and destruction 
 And I hear people on their platforms all around 
 Sayin' it's God who's judged the evils of the nations 
 With tsunamis and those towers crashin' down 
 When I think of Jesus' love and his compassion 
 And his death that paid for all our sin and shame 
 Somethin' deep inside rsepons in anger 
 'Cause I know they're tellin' lies in Jesus' name 
 And I say, Don't you talk that way about my Father 
 Evil one's the only one to blame 
 Don't you talk that way about my saviour 
 Don't try to put that stuff on Jesus' name 
 Don't you talk that way about my Father 
 There's things you say, you just cannot defend 
 Don't you talk that way about my saviour 
 Don't you talk that way about my friend 
 No, don't you talk that way about my friend

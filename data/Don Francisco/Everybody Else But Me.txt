Now way back there, in Jesus' time, the Pharisees walked so proud 
 They thought that they had the way to God; they prayed their prayers out loud 
 But Jesus said they had hell to pay for the pretense and the games they'd play 
 I'm glad that's not like us today; we wouldn't act like that 
 Everybody else but me 
 Everybody else but me 
 He was talking to the hypocrite and pharisee 
 Everybody else but me 
 I went to church one day last month; the preacher he preached real good 
 He talked about 'true commitment'; 'New Testament brotherhood' 
 He talked about watching the things we say: the gossip that can wound and slay 
 I sure wish Joe had been there that day, 'cause he really needed to hear it 
 Everybody else but me 
 Everybody else but me 
 He was talking to the hypocrite and pharisee 
 Everybody else but me 
 Jesus made disciples; he told them what they had to do 
 Turn their backs on everything, except what he'd called them to 
 He said, "Take up your cross; follow me; deny yourself and you'll be free" 
 Ah, but he meant those guys back in Galilee; that was just for them back then 
 Everybody else but me 
 Everybody else but me 
 He was talking to those people back in Galilee 
 Everybody else but me 
 Everybody else but me 
 Everybody else but me 
 He was talking to the hypocrite and pharisee 
 Everybody else but me

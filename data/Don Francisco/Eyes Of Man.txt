Just as Eve desired the fruit denied her 
 The eyes of man are fooled by what they see 
 Dazzled by this world and all its splendour 
 We reach for what it promises, but never brings to be 
 But the eyes of man have seen the Lord's salvation 
 And the hands of man have touched his only son 
 He gives us eyes to see the truth that sets us free 
 And the blood to wash us clean from all we've done 
 Blinded by the ruler of the darkness 
 Like eyeless men, we grope along the wall 
 Were it not for Jesus and his mercy 
 The only questions left us would be how and when we'd fall 
 The eyes of man have seen the Lord's salvation 
 And the hands of man have touched his only son 
 He gives us eyes to see the truth that sets us free 
 And the blood to wash us clean from all we've done 
 Now with eyes of faith I see the highway 
 His word lights all the path before my feet 
 Like the dawn that slowly brigthens to the noonday 
 Is the road I walk beside him 'til my journey is complete 
 With these eyes, I would see the face of Jesus 
 And with these hands I'll touch the wounds that made me whole 
 'Til forever has an end, and then begins again 
 Won't be long enough to gaze upon 
 The wonder of the saviour of my soul 
 And with these eyes, I will see the face of Jesus 
 With these hands I'll touch the wounds that made me whole 
 'Til forever has an end, and then begins again 
 Won't be long enough to gaze upon 
 The wonder of the saviour of my soul 
 Won't be long enough to gaze upon 
 The wonder of the saviour of my soul

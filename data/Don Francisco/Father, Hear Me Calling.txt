Deep within the silence, 
 Father, hear me calling 
 Open to Your son 
 And lift me to Your throne above 
 Lord, I need to hear You, 
 Feel Your Spirit near me 
 Feel Your arms around me, 
 Rest inside Your love. 
 Nothing on this earth 
 Can fill this thirst and longing 
 No one else can satisfy 
 The need within my soul 
 Come and fill my heart again 
 With all the love that's in You 
 Let me see Your glory, 
 Let it cleanse and make me whole. 
 There beside the river, 
 Let my spirit wander 
 With my Friend and Savior, 
 To hear the voice I love 
 Drinking sweet still waters, 
 Lying in green pastures 
 While Your gentle Spirit 
 Rests upon me like a dove.

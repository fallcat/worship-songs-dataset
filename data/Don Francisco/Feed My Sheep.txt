Just as the day was breakin' 
 Jesus stood there by the sea 
 None of us aboard that boat 
 Could tell that it was He 
 Suddenly our net was full 
 As full as it could be 
 And John said it's the Lord 
 And I rushed to Him by the sea 
 On the shore, we ate with Him 
 Just like in days gone by 
 The words that passed between us 
 I'll remember till I die 
 He said, Simon, do you love me more 
 Than all these others do? 
 I said, Lord, you have no closer friend 
 My love for you is true 
 Then He told me, feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 As if He disbelieved me 
 He asked me twice again 
 Till I said, Lord, You know everything 
 You know I am Your friend 
 If you're my friend, He said 
 You'll do the things I say 
 To love my sheep as I do 
 Till I come for them that day 
 Then He told me, feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Just feed my sheep 
 Words of love are easy 
 Actions make it real 
 Promises are worthless 
 It depends on how ya feel 
 A hireling just earns wages 
 And he runs when wolves come near 
 The shepherd guards his charges 
 And never yields to fear 
 All He said was, feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 If you love Me, feed my sheep 
 If you really love Me, feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Feed my sheep 
 Just feed my sheep

Like everyone else I tried to fly through my life 
 Using only my feelings and instincts 
 By trial and error from the day I was born 
 I'd always heard that was the way it was done 
 So, I took the throttle and I made my own course 
 I headed out somewhere that way 
 But I hit some heavy weather and crashed and burned 
 Now listen to the lesson that I had to learn 
 If you're not living by the Word of God 
 You're flying by the seat of your pants 
 If you're not living in Jesus I wouldn't give you a snowball's chance 
 Your automatic pilot isn't doing too well 
 There's been a major malfunction and you're headed for hell 
 If you're not living by the Word of God you're flying by the seat of your pants 
 Now life may bring me some spins and some dives 
 And zero visibility too 
 But by His direction and by His word 
 I know I can make it through 
 With his Spirit as co-pilot here inside 
 Using His flight manual for my guide 
 I'll make a three point landing on the other side 
 And brother He'll do the same for you 
 But if you're not living by the Word of God 
 You're flying by the seat of your pants 
 If you're not living in Jesus I wouldn't give you a snowball's chance 
 Your automatic pilot isn't doing too well 
 There's been a major malfunction and you're headed for hell 
 You'd better stop flyin' by the seat of your pants and start livin' by the Word of God 
 Start livin' by the Word, livin' by the Word, livin' by the Word of God

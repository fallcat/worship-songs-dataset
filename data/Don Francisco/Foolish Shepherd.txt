I've seen the beads upon your brow 
 Beneath the noonday sun 
 Strainin' at your buried plough 
 And the work that's never done 
 You're proud of all the things you've seen 
 And the strength of your arm and hand 
 But instead of a shepherd's crook and staff 
 Now you wield a whip and brand 
 Your Father's heart is broken 
 Still you are his son 
 But you yourself have turned your back 
 On the victory Jesus won 
 I can feel his Spirit cryin' 
 For your blindness and your pain 
 He's drawin' you with cords of love 
 To find his rest again 
 The flock of God are children still 
 They're his body and his bride 
 Now I see you beating them 
 In your anger and your pride 
 He gave his word for freedom 
 You use it to enslave 
 But when God's become your enemy 
 Tell me, who'll be there to save? 
 Standin' in the darkness 
 A sound comes on the wind 
 Music, joy and laughter 
 And it's callin' you again 
 Your brothers, they're rejoicing 
 Your father and his friends 
 Now it's up to you 
 Turn around, go back in! 
 In the end, it's up to you 
 To turn around; go back in

From the dust of the earth God formed a man 
 And He gave the breath of life and made him stand. 
 A garden by the river was his home. 
 But God said it is not good that he's alone. 
 So the Lord put birds and beasts upon the man 
 And He called them all to pass before the man 
 And Adam gave them names, to each it's own 
 But in the end he stood among them all alone. 
 So the Lord God put a sleep upon the man 
 And took a rib from Adam in His hands. 
 Then He built a living woman from the bone 
 Because it was not good for the man to be alone. 
 It's not good for a man to be alone 
 So much to share, too much that's never known. 
 She'll be closer than a friend, his flesh and bone. 
 It's not good for a man to be alone. 
 When God brought her to the man, he took her hand 
 And Adam said: since you were taken out of man 
 Woman is your name, my flesh and bone 
 And it's so good that I don't have to be alone. 
 So a man shall leave his mother and his home 
 And all he is, and all he has becomes their own. 
 For she's flesh made of his flesh, and bone of bone. 
 It's not good for a man to be alone. 
 It's not good for a man to be alone 
 So much to share, too much that's never known. 
 She'll be closer than a friend, his flesh and bone. 
 It's not good for a man to be alone.

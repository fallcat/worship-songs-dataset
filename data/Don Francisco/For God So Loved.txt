The lord of life 
 Was born a babe 
 A tender flower 
 From earth so dry 
 Just who he was 
 We could not see 
 His glory dimmed 
 By sinful lies 
 We all like sheep 
 Had gone astray 
 Each one had turned 
 To his own way 
 So on his Son 
 God made to fall 
 Cost of sin 
 For one and all 
 For God so loved 
 This fallen world 
 He sent his Son 
 From heavâ€™n on high 
 So that anyone 
 Who believes in him 
 Receives his life 
 And will never die 
 So that anyone 
 Who believes in him 
 Receives his life 
 And will never die

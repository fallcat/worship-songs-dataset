You're forever loved 
 Now and forever, My love surrounds you 
 Forever loved 
 Forever you will be My own 
 You're forever loved 
 I give you my word, that I never will leave you 
 Forever loved 
 You'll never have to be alone 
 Long before you were created 
 I knew you, I loved you 
 And called you by name 
 And all through the years 
 I've patiently waited 
 For you to grow to feel the same 
 Through all of your sins and your sorrow 
 I've loved you and stayed by your side 
 Reaching to comfort and strengthen and heal you 
 And dry every tear that you've cried 
 'Cause you're forever loved 
 Now and forever, My love surrounds you 
 Forever loved 
 Forever you will be My own 
 You're forever loved 
 I give you my word, that I never will leave you 
 Forever loved 
 You'll never have to be alone 
 There'll never come a day 
 When I fail you, 
 Or tell you that My love has ended 
 You mean even more than My life to Me 
 Forever you have been befriended 
 You're forever loved 
 I'll tell you again, that I never will leave you 
 Forever loved 
 You'll never have to be alone 
 You're forever loved 
 Now and forever, My love surrounds you 
 Forever loved 
 Forever you will be My own

It had been several years, and Jerusalem tugged at my heart 
 We saved through the Fall; the next year was the plan for the start 
 We found a ship in the Spring and the wind from the West blew up fair 
 Carried us eastward to Joppa, and set us down there 
 After four days of walking, the city at last came to view 
 But the scene we were greeted with; well, we'd have run if we knew 
 There were soldiers and a crowd screamin' loud as they burst through the gate 
 By then there was nowhere to hide, so we just had to wait 
 My sons stood there with me watching the horror unfold 
 Three men carried crossbeams, their own crucifixions the goal 
 Then in spite of the whips, one fell from the weight of his load 
 Too weak to get up, on his knees in the dust of the road 
 Then a soldier yelled out, "Hey, you," and he was lookin' my way 
 "Get over here, carry this cross!" and I had to obey 
 They unbound the prisoner's arms and the wood came up free 
 I got down on me knees there beside him and they laid it on me 
 That instant was burned on my brain when he looked in my eyes 
 "Thankyou," was all that he said, and he started to rise 
 But deep in my soul, like a shore-breaking wave of the sea 
 I knew then that something from him had flowed into me 
 I walked close behind him for a few hudnred yards, but no more 
 To a place stained with blood  from the hundreds of victims before 
 "Just drop it right here," I heard the centurion say 
 "Go on now, get out of here, just get out of the way." 
 I hadn't gone far when my feet just refused to go on 
 I wanted to flee, But instead I turned round and looked on 
 The other two screamed from the nails, loud as anyone could 
 But the man that I'd followed stayed silent as they drove through the wood 
 I wandered out loud who this strange, silent sufferer could be 
 When a man said, "That's Jesus, the prophet from Galilee 
 He was mighty in God; he was my teacher and friend 
 We called him Messiah, But now things have come to an end." 
 Then my sons came beside us and soon a small crowd stood apart 
 His family and those who had followed this man from the start 
 Through their grief and their tears they told of the wonders he'd done 
 How envy and hatred were murdering this innocent one 
 I lost track of time as darkness closed over us there 
 The sun disappeared, though there wasn't a cloud in the air 
 I heard his last words, though 'til now I did not understand 
 "It is finished; now, Father, my Spirit I place in your hands." 
 Only God can explain the connection that happened that day 
 The feast was in ruins, but still we decided to stay 
 Just doing whatever we could for the ones left behind 
 Feeding them, running their messages, easing their minds 
 It began Sunday morning when their women ran back in the room 
 Exclaiming that angels had rolled back the stone from the tomb 
 That Jesus was risen, that Mary had seen him alive 
 And Peter came too, and the man from Emmaus arrived 
 The excitement kept rising when suddenly Jesus appeared 
 But the power of his presence made everyone draw back in fear 
 He calmed us all down, and he showed us his hands and his side 
 Then he called me by name, gently he led me beside 
 He said, "Simon, you think that a soldier just picked you that day 
 But my Father has loved you and drawn you each step of the way 
 You carried that burden for me, though we'd never met 
 That bond is forever, my friend, I will never forget 
 Soon, I will leave you, but I will not leave you alone 
 My Spirit, the comforter, always will be with my own 
 I'll be making a place for the day when our joy knows no end 
 And forever, I will remember you are my friend 
 Both I and my Father call you forever 'my friend'."

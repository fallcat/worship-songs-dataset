I believe a believer has a freedom to move 
 Now, tell me mister what you're tryin' to do? 
 The things you said, man they just ain't true 
 The way the Bible, you scream and you shout 
 But you don't have a clue what you're talkin' about 
 Now you been goin' through the churches 
 Like a nazi for truth 
 Sayin' Christian rock music is destroyin' the youth 
 Slanderin' your brothers that you don't even know 
 Ruinin' reputations everywhere that you go 
 Now you call it devil music, you say it's right from the pit 
 Scarin' parents everywhere right outta their wits 
 Goin' through your meetin's buyin' books and buyin' tapes 
 But all you sell is legalism, guilt and sour grapes 
 I know you wouldn't use it for your Sunday mornin' service 
 But that ain't no excuse to get so spiritually nervous 
 I know you don't like it, but now listen my friend 
 Just cause you don't like it doesn't mean it's a sin 
 I know it isn't heavy metal, street lyrics a light 
 (I believe a believer, believe a believer) 
 But it's got a funky rhythm and the band is pretty tight 
 (I believe a believer ooh) 
 There's alot more to life then bein' down in the groove 
 But I believe a believer has the freedom to move 
 So won't you get off the soap box and take off your shoes 
 You know it ain't the rhythm it's the words that you use 
 It's not the drums or the electric guitar 
 It's all in the motives it's in who you really are 
 So won't you crank me up some country or some rhythm 'n' blues 
 I really don't care what kind o' flavor you choose 
 Just let the lyrics stay clean, let the people all groove 
 And say thank you Jesus for the freedom to move 
 Thank you Jesus for the freedom to move 
 Thank you Jesus for the freedom to move 
 Thank you Jesus for the freedom to move

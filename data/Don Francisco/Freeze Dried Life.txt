I just can't go back no more 
 'Cause every time I open up that door 
 I remember where I've been before 
 And I just can't settle 
 No, I just can't settle 
 I just can't settle for that freeze-dried life no more. 
 Now we all grow up loose or formal 
 Strange or straight, 
 An' we think it's normal, 
 But when those blinders get knocked from your eyes 
 Your preconceptions get a big surprise 
 'Cause once you stumble in to somethin' that's real 
 No one can tell you what to see and to feel 
 You just can't go back and try to fake that old game 
 Even if you do it just won't feel the same 
 The blind keep leadin' the blind 
 The sheep keep stumblin', fallin' down behind 
 Chewin' the crud that they're all bein' fed, 
 Starin' at the backsides of each others' heads 
 Like a cheatin' lover who's deceived you and lied 
 Then calls you names 'cause you ain't satisfied, 
 If you stay and deny what you know to be true 
 Man, you deserve whatever happens to you 
 So I just have to walk away 
 No pleas or threats could ever tempt me to stay, 
 'Cause I know where I've been and I know what I see, 
 You just can't choose prison when you know how it feels to be free.

Father, Creator and Savior 
 You are the friend of my soul 
 From this world and its fear and alarm 
 From all that would bring me to harm 
 I run to the shelter of your arms 
 Father, here in Your presence 
 Is mercy and the grace that I need 
 You forgive me for all of my sin 
 When I'm empty You fill me again 
 And You give me the strength 
 To go back to the battle and win 
 Forever I'll worship and sing 
 My heart is the gift that I bring 
 To my God and Redeemer and Father and King 
 Father, Your children adore You 
 There is no other like You 
 No other so holy and true, 
 So loving in all that You do 
 All glory and honor forever 
 And ever belongs to You 
 Forever we'll praise You and sing 
 Our lives are the gifts that we bring 
 To our God and Redeemer and Father and King 
 Forever we'll worship and sing 
 Our hearts are the gifts that we bring 
 To our God and Redeemer and Father and King

I was beat up by the blues so bad, morning looked like midnight come too soon 
 Even on a starry night, all I could see was just the dark side of the moon 
 I was holding tight to my illusions, on the edge of the abyss 
 Acting like I had directions to the life that I had missed 
 When your touch lit up my soul, I didn't think such love and power could exist 
 And from out of the blue, you shone into my life 
 From out of the blue, you woke up my heart 
 From out of the blue, you opened my eyes 
 From out of the blue 
 Like a lifer in a dungeon, I'd accepted my existence underground 
 Even hope was just a memory from a page some withered sage had scribbled down 
 I was so bound up in the blues that I was almost deaf and blind 
 If I heard the hinges turn, I didn't pay it any mind 
 Then you turned on all the light, and everything I knew of life was instantaneously, completely redefined 
 From out of the blue, you shone into my life 
 From out of the blue, you woke up my heart 
 From out of the blue, you opened my eyes 
 From out of the blue 
 With the power of your resurrection 
 And a gentleness I'd never known 
 At my need and your love's intercession 
 You reached out and touched me and made me forever your own 
 From out of the blue, you shone into my life 
 From out of the blue, you woke up my heart 
 From out of the blue, you took all of my fear 
 From out of the blue 
 From out of the blue 
 From out of the blue 
 From out of the blue, you opened my eyes 
 From out of the blue, you woke up my heart 
 From out of the blue, you shone into my life 
 From out of the blue 
 From out of the blue 
 From out of the blue

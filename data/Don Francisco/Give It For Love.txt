Give it for love 
 Don't do it for show 
 Give it in secret 
 When no-one will know 
 For all that you have 
 Is a gift from above 
 Like your Father in heaven 
 Give it for love 
 Do it for love 
 Don't do it for show 
 Smile when you're fasting 
 So no-one will know 
 Yielding to God 
 Is what you're thinkin' of 
 Like your Father in heaven 
 Give it for love 
 Worship in truth 
 Don't do it for show 
 Pray all alone 
 Where no-one will know 
 Let your words be few 
 For I know what you need 
 And take time to listen 
 Take time to heed 
 Worship in truth 
 Don't do it for show 
 Pray all alone 
 Where no-one will know 
 Let your words be few 
 For I know what you need 
 And take time to listen 
 Take time to heed 
 Give it for love 
 Don't do it for show 
 Give it in secret 
 When no-one will know 
 For all that you have 
 Is a gift from above 
 Like your Father in heaven 
 Give it for love

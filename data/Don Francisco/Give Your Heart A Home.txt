I hear your hollow laughter 
 Your sighs of secret pain 
 Pretending and inventing 
 Just to hide your shame 
 Plastic smiles and faces 
 Blinkin' back the tears 
 Empty friends and places 
 All magnify your fears 
 If you're tired and weary 
 Weak and heavy laden 
 I can understand how 
 It feels to be alone 
 I will take your burden 
 If you'll let Me love you 
 Wrap My arms around you 
 Give your heart a home 
 It hurts to watch you struggle 
 And try so hard to win 
 But trade your precious birth rite 
 For candy coated sin 
 Wasting priceless moments 
 Restless and confused 
 Building up defenses 
 For fear that you'll be used 
 If you're tired and weary 
 Weak and heavy laden 
 I can understand how 
 It feels to be alone 
 I will take your burden 
 If you'll let Me love you 
 Wrap My arms around you 
 Give your heart a home 
 Take My yolk upon you 
 And walk here by My side 
 Let Me heal your heartaches 
 And dry the tears you've cried 
 Never will I leave you 
 Never turn away 
 Keep you through the darkness 
 Lead you through the day 
 If you're tired and weary 
 Weak and heavy laden 
 I can understand how 
 It feels to be alone 
 I will take your burden 
 If you'll let Me love you 
 Wrap My arms around you 
 Give your heart a home 
 Wrap My arms around you 
 Give your heart a home

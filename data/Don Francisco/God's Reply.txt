Spoken: 
 Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the whirlwind. 
 Come, gird up your loins like a man 
 Answer Me now if you can 
 Where were you when I made all you see? 
 If you know, then come tell it to Me 
 Has the morning been at your command? 
 Have you made the dawn come when you planned? 
 Which way to the dwelling of light? 
 And just where is the home of the night? 
 Will you try to tell God what should be? 
 Speak up if you know more than Me! 
 Will the creature now rise to My height 
 And tell Me what I do is not right? 
 Now stand up in majestic array 
 In glory more bright than the day 
 Send all who have sinned to their graves 
 Then perhaps your own life you could save 
 So, come, gird up your loins like a man 
 And answer Me now if you can 
 Exalt yourself now in My sight 
 Condemn Me so you can be right 
 Exalt yourself now in My sight 
 And condemn Me so you can be right 
 Lord, behold, I am nothing but dust 
 In Your presence, no man can be just 
 Proud words came before You were here 
 Now I tremble in terror and fear 
 As a fool I have raged on alone 
 But no more, as I kneel at Your throne 
 I had heard just a whisper, a trace 
 All is changed when we meet face to face 
 Such things I did not understand 
 Theyâ€™re too great for the mind of a man 
 All my words have been foolish and rash 
 I repent in the dust and the ash 
 All my words have been foolish and rash 
 And I repent in the dust and the ash 
 Spoken: 
 And it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has." And the Lord restored Job's fortunes when he prayed for his friends; also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons' sons, even four generations. So Job died, being old and full of days.

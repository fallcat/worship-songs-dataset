Now a long time ago lived a man named Job 
 Who was reverent and righteous, turnin' from sin 
 He had many children, cattle, and servants 
 Indeed he was richer than all other men 
 Now there came a time when the angels of God 
 Went to present themselves there at His throne 
 The devil was also among them that day 
 And he stood before God just like one of His own 
 "Have you consider Job?"  said the Lord 
 "A man who is blameless in word and in deed 
 None on the earth can be likened to him 
 Whatever is righteous, he’s anxious to heed" 
 "Well, of course the man's faithful and obedient to You 
 He’s just playin' the game because You do what You do 
 You’ve put up a hedge ‘round his house and his lands 
 You’ve been blessin' his blocks and every work of his hands 
 He's like all the rest of this rabble today 
 He gives loyal service to the one who will pay 
 But take away all of those things that You gave 
 And he'll curse You ‘til the day that he goes to his grave!" 
 Then the devil went out, took all of Job's riches 
 And he killed all his children in an instant of time 
 And Job tore his robes, but he worshipped the Lord 
 And Job did not sin or curse God for this crime 
 Now again came a time when the angels of God 
 Went to present themselves there at His throne 
 The devil was also among them that day 
 And he stood before God just like one of His own 
 "Have you considered Job?" said the Lord 
 "Even though without reason you've brought him so low 
 Still he is faithful, he's righteous and blameless 
 For all of your evil there’s nothin' to show" 
 "Well, of course he's been quiet and he's holdin' his tongue 
 A man'd give all he owns to escape bein' hung! 
 But if You'll just let me lay his body to waste 
 The veneer will come off and he’ll spit in Your face!" 
 So Satan went out and he struck Job with sores 
 From his head to his feet, he had boils on his skin 
 Until even his wife shrieked at Job and said 
 "Why don’t you just give it up; go on, curse God and die!" 
 But Job sat in ashes alone with his pain 
 And wished for the day when he'd go to the dead 
 And though covered in misery, he still held his peace 
 And committed no sin in the words that he said

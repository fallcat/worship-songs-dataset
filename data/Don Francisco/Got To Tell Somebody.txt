She kept on getting weaker 
 As day dragged into day 
 The doctors gave no hope for her 
 She seemed to fade away 
 My hours were filled with constant dread 
 Time became a knife 
 Slowly and relentlessly 
 Cut the cord of life 
 There was a Teacher in the region then 
 Some of us had heard 
 He'd healed the paralytic 
 By the power of just His word 
 So if the hope became rekindled 
 I went at once to see 
 If I could find a man named Jesus 
 From a town called Galilee 
 I began to search the city 
 And soon I saw the crowd 
 They were pressing in to touch Him 
 And they called His name out loud 
 But with the strength of desperation 
 I pushed them all aside 
 I threw myself before Him 
 And from my knees I cried 
 Lord, come and heal my daughter 
 Even now she's close to death 
 Her fever's uncontrolable 
 She fights for every breath 
 But God's given you the power 
 Life is yours to give 
 If You'll just lay Your hands on her 
 I know that she will live, she will live, she will live 
 Well, He just began to walk with me 
 When a face I saw with fear 
 Came towards me with the news 
 I knew I didn't wanna hear 
 And although I tried still myself 
 I trembled when he said 
 Don't bother the teacher anymore 
 Your little girl is dead 
 And then Jesus touched my shoulder 
 And told me not to grieve 
 The trembling stopped when He looked at me 
 And said only believe 
 And then He sent the crowds away 
 Except His closest men 
 And they followed right behind us 
 As we started off again 
 We were still a long ways down the road 
 When I heard the sounds and cries 
 Of the mourners and musicians 
 As they strove to dramatize 
 My grief, they had no business with 
 Beneath their loud disguise 
 My wife just sat there silently 
 And stared through empty eyes 
 Then Jesus asked the mourners 
 Why is it that you weep? 
 She isn't dead as you suppose 
 The child is just asleep 
 It only took a moment 
 For their wails to turn to jeers 
 Who does this Man think He is? 
 Get Him outta here 
 With authority I've never heard 
 In the lips of any man 
 He spoke and every sound rolled out 
 With a thunder of command 
 And in the sudden silence 
 They all hurried for the door 
 Wondering what the reasons were 
 They'd ever come there for 
 Then He called His three disciples 
 That were with Him on the way 
 He led them and my wife and me 
 To where our daughter lay 
 He took her by the hand 
 He told her, child arise 
 And the words were barely spoken 
 When she opened up her eyes 
 She rose and walked across the room 
 And stood there at our sides 
 My wife knelt down and held her close 
 And at last she really cried 
 Then Jesus told us both to see 
 Our daughter had some food 
 And as to how her life was saved 
 Not to speak a word, not to speak a word 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody, got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did for me 
 I got to tell somebody 
 Got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did for me 
 I got to tell somebdoy 
 Got to tell somebdoy 
 What Jesus did for me 
 I got to tell somebody 
 Got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did for me 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did, What Jesus did for me 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did, What Jesus did for me 
 Ya know He gave me life 
 When my hope was dead 
 When there was grief 
 He brought joy instead 
 Got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did for me 
 I got to tell somebody 
 Got to tell somebody 
 I got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did for me 
 I got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did 
 I got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did 
 Got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did for me 
 I've got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did 
 I got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did 
 I got to tell somebody 
 What Jesus did for me

Saul left for Damascus breathing murder and hate 
 With a handful of warrants I suspected his fate 
 He met the Lord on the highway, turned his life all around 
 He spent the rest of his days telling everyone all about the Saviour he'd found 
 He had to tell the story 
 Jesus set him free 
 Give God the glory 
 For the victory 
 Shouting hallelujah 
 The whole day long 
 Singing over and over 
 Salvation's song 
 Now a man named Cornelius was a soldier of Rome 
 He sent a message to Peter to come and preach at his home 
 The Holy Spirit descended on everyone in the crowd 
 Everybody was speakin' in tongues and praying and shoutin' out loud. 
 He had to tell the story 
 Jesus set him free 
 Give God the glory 
 For the victory 
 Shouting hallelujah 
 The whole day long 
 Singing over and over 
 Salvation's song 
 I was bound by Satan but Jesus set me free 
 Filled me up with His Spirit for all eternity 
 Gave me decent direction, took the weight of my load 
 Gave me so much joy in my heart 
 I feel like I'm going to explode. 
 He had to tell the story 
 Jesus set him free 
 Give God the glory 
 For the victory 
 Shouting hallelujah 
 The whole day long 
 Singing over and over 
 Salvation's song

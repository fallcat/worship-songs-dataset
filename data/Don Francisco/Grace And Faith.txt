We are saved by grace and faith 
 No room for a man to boast 
 Because it all is a gift from God 
 Father, Son and the Holy Ghost 
 We are saved by grace and faith 
 No room for a man to boast 
 Because it all is a gift from God 
 Father, Son and the Holy Ghost 
 Jesus died upon the cross 
 For every sin that you will ever do 
 When you reach out to him in faith 
 Eternal life comes in to you 
 And the faith that saves your soul 
 Is not a thing you have to make or find 
 It is a gift to you from God 
 Not a product of your mind 
 We are saved by grace and faith 
 No room for a man to boast 
 Because it all is a gift from God 
 Father, Son and the Holy Ghost 
 Now the door, it is Jesus Christ 
 Faith, it is the only key 
 Every promise ever made by God 
 Is ‘yes and amen’ now to you and me 
 And because it is all by grace 
 There is nothing you can earn or do 
 All you say is, “Thank you, Lord,” 
 Because it’s already there for you 
 Thank you 
 We are saved by grace and faith 
 No room for a man to boast 
 Because it all is a gift from God 
 Father, Son and the Holy Ghost 
 We are saved by grace and faith (saved by grace and faith) 
 No room for a man to boast (no room to boast, no) 
 Because it all is a gift from God (everything is from God) 
 Father, Son and the Holy Ghost

When God came and lived among us 
 We could see His glory shine 
 A glory like no one before Him 
 Nor will be through endless time 
 Far beyond the power of angels 
 Wholy God, and wholly man 
 So full of grace and truth and mercy 
 With a Shepherdâ€™s gentle hands 
 Moses gave the Law to bind us 
 The prophets spoke just as they had heard 
 But Jesus came and lived among us 
 And we touched the living word 
 Seeing Jesus, we saw the Father 
 The great Physician, the sinner's friend 
 Loving all who would receive Him 
 And He loved us to the end 
 Virgin born, the son of David 
 By jealous hatred was crucified 
 Oh, but the grave just could not hold Him 
 And He arose, no more to die 
 Rising Son of life unbounded 
 The light of all, whoever see 
 And from His overflowing bounty 
 Grace on grace He gave to you and me 
 When Jesus came and lived among us 
 We could see His glory shine 
 When He ascended unto the Father 
 He made that glory yours and mine 
 The promised power, His Holy Spirit 
 Has come to make our hearts His home 
 To shine the righteous light of Jesus 
 Until He comes back to claim His own 
 'Til He comes back to claim His own

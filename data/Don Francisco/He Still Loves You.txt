When the world outside’s been closing in around you 
 And the way from here is more than you can see, 
 When the day’s been more than you’ve had strength to handle, 
 When a man is more than you know how to be; 
 When the ones you love are trapped in lies and sorrow, 
 And you just can’t lift the weight that holds them there; 
 When your friends have gone and left you empty-handed, 
 Your loneliness is just too much to bear. 
 He still loves you; he’s just waiting 
 For your struggles and your strategies to end; 
 He’s been beside you every long and weary mile 
 If you just let him lead the way, he’ll be your friend. 
 When at least you’re tired of trying to be a Christian 
 And you’ve seen the end of all that you can do; 
 When you realise how little you’re worth without him 
 He’ll still be reaching out with love to you 
 He still loves you; he’s just waiting 
 For your struggles and your strategies to end; 
 He’s been beside you every long and weary mile 
 If you just let him lead the way, he’ll be your friend. 
 He still loves you; he’s just waiting 
 For your struggles and your strategies to end; 
 He’s been beside you every long and weary mile 
 If you just let him lead the way, he’ll be your friend. 
 His love never ends.

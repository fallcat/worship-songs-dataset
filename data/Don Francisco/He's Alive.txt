The gates and doors were barred 
 And all the windows fastened down 
 I spent the night in sleeplessness 
 And rose at every sound 
 Half in hopeless sorrow 
 And half in fear the day 
 Would find the soldiers breakin' through 
 To drag us all away 
 Just before the sunrise 
 I heard something at the wall 
 The gate began to rattle 
 And a voice began to call 
 I hurried to the window 
 And looked down into the street 
 Expecting swords and torches 
 And the sound of soldiers' feet 
 There was no one there but Mary 
 So I went down to let her in 
 John stood there beside me 
 As she told us where she'd been 
 She said they've moved Him in the night 
 None of us knows where 
 The stone's been rolled away 
 Now His body isn't there 
 We both ran toward the garden 
 Then John ran on ahead 
 We found the stone and the empty tomb 
 Just the way that Mary said 
 But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in 
 Was just an empty shell 
 How or where they'd taken Him 
 Was more than I could tell 
 Somethin' strange had happened there 
 But just what, I did not know 
 John believed a miracle 
 But I just turned to go 
 Circumstance and speculation 
 Couldn't lift me very high 
 'Cause I'd seen them crucify him 
 Then I saw him die 
 Back inside the house again 
 The guilt and anguish came 
 Everything I'd promised Him 
 Just added to my shame 
 'Cause when at last it came to choices 
 I'd denied I knew His name 
 Even if He was alive 
 It wouldn't be the same 
 But suddenly the air was filled 
 With a strange and sweet perfume 
 Light that came from everywhere 
 Drove shadows from the room 
 And Jesus stood before me 
 With his arms held open wide 
 I fell down on my knees 
 And just clung to Him and cried 
 He raised me to my feet 
 As I looked into His eyes 
 Love was shining out from Him 
 Like sunlight from the skies 
 Guilt and my confusion 
 Disappeared in sweet release 
 And every fear I'd ever had 
 Just melted into peace 
 He's alive; He's alive 
 He's alive, and I'm forgiven 
 Heaven's gates are open wide 
 He's alive; He's alive 
 He's alive, and I'm forgiven 
 Heaven's gates are open wide 
 He's alive; He's alive 
 He's alive, and I'm forgiven 
 Heaven's gates are open wide 
 He's alive; He's alive 
 He's alive

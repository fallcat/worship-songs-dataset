Help me, Lord Jesus, to worship you 
 Lord, my flesh seems so strong 
 Help me, Lord Jesus, to worship you 
 Holy Spirit, inhabit my song 
 By your blood, you have cleansed me from all of my sin 
 By your grace, you've made heaven my home 
 So, Lord, in your mercy, take hold of my heart 
 Lift me in praise to your throne 
 Help me, Lord Jesus, to worship you 
 Lord, my flesh seems so strong 
 Help me, Lord Jesus, to worship you 
 Holy Spirit, inhabit my song 
 By your blood, you have cleansed me from all of my sin 
 By your grace, you've made heaven my home 
 So, Lord, in your mercy, take hold of my heart 
 Lift me in praise to your throne 
 By your blood, you have cleansed me from all of my sin 
 By your grace, you've made heaven my home 
 So, Lord, in your mercy, take hold of my heart 
 Lift me in praise to your throne 
 Help me, Lord Jesus, to worship you 
 Lord, my flesh seems so strong 
 Help me, Lord Jesus, to worship you 
 Holy Spirit, inhabit my song

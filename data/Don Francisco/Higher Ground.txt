I’m pressing on the upward way 
 His light grows brighter every day 
 Still prayin’ as I onward bound 
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground 
 My heart has no desire to stay 
 Where doubts arise and fears dismay 
 Though some may dwell where these abound 
 My prayer, my aim, is higher ground 
 Lord, lift me up and let me stand 
 By faith on heaven’s table land 
 A higher plain than I have found 
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground 
 I choose to live above this world 
 I’ve made my stand, my flag’s unfurled 
 For faith has caught the joyful sound 
 The song of saints on higher ground 
 Lord, lift me up and let me stand 
 By faith on heaven’s table land 
 A higher plain than I have found 
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground 
 Now by His grace I’ll walk the heights 
 And live my life by glory’s light 
 Still pressin’ on ‘til heav’n I’ve found 
 And set my feet on higher ground 
 Lord, lift me up and let me stand 
 By faith on heaven’s table land 
 A higher plain than I have found 
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground

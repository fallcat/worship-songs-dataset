The temple tax people were workin' the streets 
 And Peter was outside that day 
 They said, "Where is the tax for your teacher? 
 The law says we all have to pay." 
 So Peter went in to see Jesus 
 But before he had spoken a word 
 Jesus asked Peter a question 
 'Cause he knew what Peter just heard 
 How do the kings of this earth get their money 
 For all of the things they want done 
 Do they levy a tax on their subjects 
 Or collect from their daughters and sons? 
 Peter said, "Lord, you know it's the subjects 
 That get taxed by the loyalty." 
 Jesus told him, "You've seen it correctly 
 So their sons and their daughters are free." 
 A king only taxes his subjects 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 Free of religion's demands and decrees 
 Heirs to a throne beyond rank or degree 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 So the next time you hear someone tell you 
 When the plate starts comin' around 
 That a tithe must come out of your paycheque 
 Or the judgement of God will come down 
 Remember what Jesus told Peter 
 'Cause it's still just as true as can be 
 A king doesn't tax his own family 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 Free of religion's demands and decrees 
 Heirs to a throne beyond rank or degree 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 So where does this leave a believer? 
 How does Godly royalty behave? 
 Will you give with a spirit's compassion 
 Not living in fear like a slave? 
 Bow down to no mask of religion 
 Stand up where he's made you to be 
 You're a child of the king of creation 
 And his sons and his daughters are free 
 Free of religion's demands and decrees 
 Far beyond hierarchy, rank or degree 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 Free of religion's demands and decrees 
 Heirs to a throne beyond rank or degree 
 His sons and his daughters are free 
 His sons and his daughters are free

We all had been prayin' that God would arise 
 Still nothing would move, all except for my eyes 
 Then someone said Jesus was in the next town 
 And if we went there and looked, he could surely be found 
 At the place he was staying, there were crowds at the door 
 But we'd made up our minds what we'd all come there for 
 So I closed my eyes tight as they hauled me upstairs 
 To the flat of the roof, and they laid me down there 
 And my friends tore a hole to the room down below 
 Through mud and the tiles and the thatching, and so 
 They lowered me down in the midst of the crowd 
 There was coughing and yelling and laughing out loud 
 And fear rose inside me as they stared at me there 
 That God or this teacher wouldn't answer our prayers 
 But I heard softly spoken, "Take courage, my son 
 Your sins are forgiven;" the fear came undone 
 Then the same gentle voice asked the ones there inside 
 "Why do such evil thoughts fill your hearts and your minds? 
 Do ya think I've no right to my words here today 
 That I bluff and blaspheme by these things that I say? 
 What's easier to say, 'Your sins are washed clean' 
 Or 'Stand up and walk' since the proof will be seen? 
 So to show you that God's in these words I've just said 
 I say, 'Stand up and walk; go home with your bed.'" 
 And at once then a power, alive and so strong 
 Shot through me, and all was made right that was wrong 
 I got quick to my feet, and I picked up that bed 
 And pushed up through the throng with his words in my head 
 And the crowd came alive as I walked to the street 
 Much shouting and clapping and stamping of feet 
 My friends and I danced like we'd just won a war 
 And we laughed 'til we cried, and praised God some more 
 When we came back next morning, he was down by the sea 
 So we patched up the roof they'd torn open for me 
 Then we listened to him, 'til the people had gone 
 Then I went up to thank him for all he had done 
 He just smiled as I tried to match words to my heart 
 Then he said, "It's a pleasure for me on my part 
 But it was your faith that let me come in 
 Because you believed, now you're free of your sin 
 Your faith was the door that let me come in 
 And because you believed, you've been healed 
 Set free of your sin."

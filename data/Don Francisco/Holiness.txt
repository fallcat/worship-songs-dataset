When God took His people 
 To the promised land 
 He gave them their freedom 
 He gave a command 
 He said, West of the Jordan 
 You can have all you see 
 But the ware of their idols 
 Won't be holy to Me 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's the only life 
 That the Lord can bless 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's the Lord's command 
 Not the Lord's request 
 They heard the commandment 
 But did not obey 
 They hardened their hearts 
 And wandered away 
 From the goodness of God 
 And the blessings He gave 
 Through traditions of men 
 And the yolk of a slave 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's the only life 
 That the Lord can bless 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's the Lord's command 
 Not the Lord's request 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's a life apart 
 From the world's excess 
 For the people of God 
 The remains of rest 
 Holiness, holiness 
 Jesus is calling you 
 Come take My hand 
 I'll lead you away 
 From the wilderness land 
 To a place full of goodness 
 As far as the sea 
 But remember Who brought you 
 And be holy to Me 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's not your food or drink 
 It's not the way to dress 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's to hear the Lord 
 And answer yes 
 Holiness, holiness 
 It's the only life 
 That the Lord can bless 
 For the people of God 
 The remains of rest 
 For the people of God 
 The remains of rest 
 Holiness, holiness

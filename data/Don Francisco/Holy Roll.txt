Well, I was lost in the wilderness o' shiftin' sand 
 And the devil, he was takin' his toll 
 When Jesus came through me, He held out His hand 
 I said I had it all under control 
 Now, I don't know why 
 I let the chance go by 
 It took me so long to see 
 Everywhere that I turned 
 I just kept gettin' burned 
 Until I let Him set me free 
 I did all that I could 
 Tryin' to prove I was good 
 I was set as anybody could be 
 I sunk about as low 
 As a man could go 
 Even demons were inhabiting me 
 Now I can't really say 
 Why I wanted to pay 
 Those dues to the devil so long 
 But you can take it from me 
 It feels good to be free 
 That's my reason for singin' a song 
 Cause there's not enough reasons 
 In this world to be down 
 If you'll just open up your ears and your eyes 
 Cause He's faithful and true 
 He's just waitin' for you 
 To give in and take off your disguise 
 It feels so good to do 
 You just tell Him you're through 
 You want Him to be in control 
 And God'll write your name 
 On that holy roll 
 And hallelujah, He'll save your soul! 
 Cause there's not enough reasons 
 In this world to be down 
 If you'll just open up your ears and your eyes 
 Cause He's faithful and true 
 He's just waitin' for you 
 To give in and take off your disguise 
 It feels so good to do 
 You just tell Him you're through 
 You want Him to be in control 
 And God'll write your name 
 On that holy roll 
 And hallelujah, He'll save your soul! 
 Hallelujah, He'll save your soul!

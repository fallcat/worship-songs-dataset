How firm a foundation 
 You saints of the Lord 
 Has been laid for your faith 
 In his excellent word 
 What more can he say 
 Than to you he said 
 Unto you, who for refuge 
 To Jesus have fled? 
 And when through fiery trials 
 Your pathway shall lie 
 My grace all-sufficient shall be your supply 
 I'll strengthen you, help you 
 And cause you to stand 
 Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand 
 The soul that on Jesus 
 Has leaned for repose 
 I will not, I will not 
 Desert to his foes 
 That soul, though all hell 
 Shall endeavour to shake 
 I will never, no never 
 No never forsake 
 How firm a foundation 
 You saints of the Lord 
 Has been laid for your faith 
 In his excellent word 
 A promise of God 
 To his children below 
 'Do not fear, I am with you 
 Wherever you go'

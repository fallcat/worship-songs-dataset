I hope you'll forgive me 
 For the thoughts that I had 
 When I heard the news 
 And I knew that I wasn't the dad 
 I thought you'd betrayed me; I never imagined 
 What now I know to be true 
 And I feel so ashamed 
 That I had those doubts about you 
 It was yesterday mornin' 
 That I heard it from a cousin of mine 
 I didn't know what to do 
 I spent the whole day cryin' 
 But late last night, I had a wonderful dream 
 An angel told me all about you 
 That the baby inside you is something a man didn't do 
 I want you to know that I feel just the same 
 I'm so proud that you're mine and you'll carry my name 
 And I don't know exactly what we're gonna do 
 But I believe in Him 
 And I believe in you 
 Now our families and the people we know 
 And the rest of this town 
 They're already talkin' 
 You know it's goin' around 
 But together we'll stand for the truth that we know 
 Until heaven shows us some more 
 'Cause God's doing something that never has happened before 
 I want you to know that I feel just the same 
 I'm so proud that you're mine and you'll carry my name 
 And I don't know exactly what we're gonna do 
 But I believe in Him 
 And I believe in you 
 I want you to know that I feel just the same 
 I'm so proud that you're mine and you'll carry my name 
 And I don't know exactly what we're gonna do 
 But I believe in Him 
 And I believe in you 
 I believe in Him 
 And I believe in you

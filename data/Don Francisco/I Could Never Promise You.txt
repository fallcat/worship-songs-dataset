I could never promise you 
 On just my strength alone 
 That all my life I'd care for you 
 And love you as my own 
 I've never known the future 
 I only see today 
 Words that last a lifetime 
 Would be more than I could say 
 But the love inside my heart today 
 Is more than mine alone 
 It never changes, never fails 
 And never seeks its own 
 And by the God who gives it 
 And who lives in me and you 
 I know the words I speak today 
 Are words I'm going to do 
 And so I stand before you now 
 For all to hear and see 
 And promise you in Jesus' name 
 The love He's given me 
 And through the years on earth 
 And as eternity goes by 
 The life and love He's given us 
 Are never going to die 
 So I stand before you now 
 For all to hear and see 
 And promise you in Jesus' name 
 The love He's given me 
 And through the years on earth 
 And as eternity goes by 
 The life and love He's given us 
 Are never going to die 
 The life and love He's given us 
 Are never going to die

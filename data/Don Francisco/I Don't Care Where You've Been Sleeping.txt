I loved you long before the time 
 Your eyes first saw the day 
 And everything I've done has been 
 To help you on the way 
 But you took all that you wanted 
 And at last you took your leave 
 And traded off a kingdom 
 For the lies that you've believed 
 And although you've chosen darkness 
 With its miseries and fears 
 Although you've gone so far from me 
 And wasted all these years 
 Even though my name's been spattered 
 By the mire in which you lie 
 I'd take you back this instant 
 If you turn to me and cry 
 I don't care where you've been sleepin' 
 I don't care who's made your bed 
 I already gave My life to set you free 
 There's no sin you could imagine 
 That is stronger than My love 
 And it's all yours if you'll come home again to Me 
 When you've come back to your senses 
 And you see who's been to blame 
 Remember all the good things 
 That were yours with just My name 
 And then don't waste another thought 
 Before you change the way you're bound 
 I'll be runnin' out to meet you 
 If you'll only turn around, just turn around 
 I don't care where you've been sleepin' 
 I don't care who's made your bed 
 I already gave My life to set you free 
 There's no sin you could imagine 
 That is stronger than My love 
 It's all yours if you'll come home again to Me 
 I don't care where you've been sleepin' 
 I don't care who's made your bed 
 I already gave My life to set you free 
 There's no sin you could imagine 
 That is stronger than My love 
 It's all yours if you'll come home again to Me

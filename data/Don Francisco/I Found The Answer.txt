When you feel that aching emptiness 
 The hunger in your soul 
 When all your satisfactions leave behind an empty hole 
 Be aware of what is happening 
 Don't cover it with pride 
 Just let hour heart cry out for all the love it's been denied 
 Because you're tied up in your pleasures 
 You're blind and think you see 
 The world around you lies and say that's how it's got to be 
 But there's a stirring in your spirit now 
 That echoes what I say 
 That love and truth are real if you could only find the way 
 I found the answer to all of my pain 
 I found a way to start living again 
 I'll sing it out loud, "Jesus is who He says, 
 I believe in my heart that He rose from the dead" 
 Jesus is the truth, He is life, He is the say 
 The ruler of the universe is calling you today 
 To leave behind the foolish pride that's kept you so alone 
 To reach out through the Son of God and let Him take you home 
 I found the answer to all of my pain 
 I found a way to start living again 
 I'll sing it out loud, "Jesus is who He says, 
 I believe in my heart that He rose from the dead" 
 I found the answer to all of my pain 
 I found a way to start living again 
 I'll sing it out loud, "Jesus is who He says 
 I believe in my heart that He rose from the dead" 
 I found the answer to all of my pain 
 I found a way to start living again 
 I'll sing it out loud, "Jesus is who He says 
 I believe in my heart that He rose from the dead" 
 I found the answer to all of my pain 
 I found a way to start living again 
 I'll sing it out loud, "Jesus is who He says 
 I believe in my heart that He rose from the dead"

I Have Chosen You 
 Like a king who hides in shadows while a thief usurps his throne 
 You stumbled down through all your days without direction. 
 While the soldiers and the servants who should be at your command 
 Are all abandoned to surrender and defection. 
 As the kingdom groans beneath the load, 
 Your feet go running down the road 
 In panic you've forgotten all I've told you. 
 If you'll just call you'd see Me there 
 At the very instant of your prayer 
 But you've bought a bill of goods the liar's sold you. 
 I have chosen you 
 There's no need to run away. 
 I have chosen you 
 Why do you doubt the words I say. 
 Through it all I've been right by your side. 
 Ask me and you will not be denied. 
 Like a slave who wears the collar of a hard and cruel man 
 And is convinced that he deserves the treetment given. 
 Tortured to believing nothing's ever going to change 
 Till you've forgotten there was ever more to living. 
 But as you struggle with your load 
 The messengers come down the road 
 And the slaver flees in fear as he beholds them. 
 They break your chains and set you free 
 To stand amazed in liberty 
 And at last they give the word that God has told them. 
 I have chosen you 
 And I will not turn you down, 
 I have chosen you 
 You were born to wear a crown. 
 I'll give you what you need to carry on 
 Till all that stands opposed to you is gone. 
 I have chosen you 
 And I will not turn you down, 
 I have chosen you 
 You were born to wear a crown. 
 Through it all I've been right by your side. 
 Ask me now, you will not be denied. 
 Ask me now, you will not be denied. 
 Ask me now, you will not be denied.

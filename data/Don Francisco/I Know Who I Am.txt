I know who I am. 
 I know where I'm going. 
 I know why I'm here, why I'm here with you. 
 I know wht the earth goes around. 
 I know where the answers found. 
 I know loves forever. 
 I know that it's true. 
 I know who to trust. 
 I know where to find him. 
 I know that he listens when I call his name. 
 My souls safe with-in his care. 
 I know I can leave it there. 
 I know in the end I won't be ashamed. 
 It's not how hard you work. 
 It's not how much you pay. 
 Or if you've towed the line. 
 Or why you went astray. 
 There's no place left for crying. 
 It isn't what you do but a gift he's given me; 
 That's there for you. 
 I know who I am. 
 I know where I'm going. 
 I know why I'm here, why I'm here with you. 
 I know why the earth goes around. 
 I know where the answers found. 
 I know love's forever. 
 I know that it's true. 
 I know love's forever. 
 I know that it's true. 
 I know love's forever. 
 I know that it's true.

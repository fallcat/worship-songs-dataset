I love your presence Lord, 
 No more do I desire 
 Immersed in holy love 
 Baptized in holy fire 
 Set free to worship you 
 So soar upon your wings 
 To open wide the door 
 And let my spirit sing 
 I love your presence Lord, 
 No more do I desire 
 Immersed in holy love 
 Baptized in holy fire 
 The world falls far below 
 Your glory comes so near 
 My heart just overflows 
 Whenever you are here 
 I love your presence Lord, 
 No more do I desire 
 Immersed in holy love 
 Baptized in holy fire 
 The old is overcome 
 By life that has no end 
 And so you fill my soul 
 With grace and peace again 
 I love your presence Lord, 
 No more do I desire 
 Immersed in holy love 
 Baptized in holy fire

So many things I've meant to say, 
 So much I've meant to show 
 It's easy letting time go by, 
 And to think somehow you'll know 
 So I wrote this song to just make sure 
 You never doubt it's true 
 That I thank God for you 
 I thank God for you. 
 You spend yourself so freely 
 In the things you do for me 
 You're always there to lift me up 
 When I'm less than I should be 
 To earn the kind of love you give 
 There's nothing I could do 
 And I thank God for you 
 I thank God for you. 
 I thank God because He's given me 
 A lover and a friend 
 With a heart that I can trust in 
 Through it all until the end 
 I thank God because you're more 
 Than I had ever hoped to find 
 No one else this side of heaven 
 Gives me so much peace of mind. 
 The years have gone so quickly 
 Since we changed to one from two 
 But time has just intensified 
 The bond I share with you 
 And, yes, I'd do it all again to love you as I do 
 I thank God for you 
 I thank God for you.

I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 That you still love me 
 When I fall 
 You come and help me 
 When I call 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 One day, I looked around me 
 Everything in my life was wrong 
 I tried to say that I could make it okay 
 But my strength was not that strong 
 I had no-one but myself to blame 
 And there was nothing I could do 
 But I held on tight to your love for me 
 And you made my dreams come true 
 But I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 That you still love me 
 When I fall 
 You come and help me 
 When I call 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 Now, even if the whole world comes down on me 
 I know you will take me up 
 'Cause you pour every thing that's good 
 To my overflowing cup 
 And now I can hold my head up high 
 Even when it all looks wrong 
 And offer a sacrifice of joy 
 To the Lord in a brand new song 
 But I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 That you still love me 
 When I fall 
 You come and help me 
 When I call 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 Don't you go thinkin' that I'm blowin' my horn 
 Sayin' that it's somethin' in me 
 'Cause all we've got is a gift from God 
 Believe it and it'll make you see 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 That you still love me 
 When I fall 
 You come and help me 
 When I call 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it (I wouldn't have made it) 
 If I had not believed 
 That you still love me 
 When I fall 
 You come and help me 
 When I call 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 But I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 That you still love me 
 When I fall 
 You come and help me 
 When I call 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 But I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed 
 That you still love me 
 When I fall 
 You come and help me 
 When I call 
 I wouldn't have made it 
 If I had not believed

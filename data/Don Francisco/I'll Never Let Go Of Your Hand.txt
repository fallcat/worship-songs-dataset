I know what you've been hearing 
 I've seen you hide your fear 
 Embarrased by your weaknesses 
 Afraid to let Me near 
 I wish you knew how much I long 
 For you to understand 
 No matter what may happen, child 
 I'll never let go of your hand 
 I know you've been forsaken 
 By all you've known before 
 When you've failed their expectations 
 They frown and close the door 
 But even though your heart itself 
 Should lose the will to stand 
 No matter what may happen, child 
 I'll never let go of your hand 
 The life that I have given you 
 No one can take away 
 I've sealed it with My Spirit, blood and word 
 The everlasting Father has made His covenant with you 
 And He's stronger than the world you've seen and heard 
 So don't you fear to show them 
 All the love I have for you 
 I'll be with you everywhere 
 In everything you do 
 And even if you do it wrong 
 And miss the joy I planned 
 I'll never, never let go of your hand 
 The life that I have given you 
 No one can take away 
 I've sealed it with My Spirit, blood and word 
 The everlasting Father has made His covenant with you 
 And He's stronher than the world you've seen and heard 
 So don't you fear to show them 
 All the love I have for you 
 I'll be with you everywhere 
 In everything you do 
 And even if you do it wrong 
 And miss the joy I planned 
 I'll never, never let go of your hand 
 I'll never let go of your hand

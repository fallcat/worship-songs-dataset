Gonna walk a little closer with my Lord 
 When he talks to me, I'm gonna be obedient to his word 
 Gonna live as he commands; gonna pray with holy hands 
 Today, I'm gonna walk just a little bit closer with my Lord 
 My brother Paul, he gave his all: a living sacrifice 
 He just kept on walking; every day he paid the price 
 He never claimed he'd made the grade, but this one thing he'd do 
 He pressed on to be like Jesus 'til this time on this earth is through 
 And me, I'm gonna walk with my Lord 
 When he talks to me, I'm gonna be obedient to his word 
 Gonna live as he commands; gonna pray with holy hands 
 Today, I'm gonna walk just a little bit closer with my Lord 
 I don't make no promises about great and mighty changes 
 Through this day, I'm gonna play what the Holy Ghost arranges 
 I don't make no promises about great and mighty changes 
 Through this day, I'm gonna play what the Holy Ghost arranges 
 Gonna walk a little closer with my Lord 
 When he talks to me, I'm gonna be obedient to his word 
 Gonna live as he commands; gonna pray with holy hands 
 Today, I'm gonna walk just a little bit closer 
 Gonna listen just a little bit closer 
 Gonna follow just a little bit closer with my Lord

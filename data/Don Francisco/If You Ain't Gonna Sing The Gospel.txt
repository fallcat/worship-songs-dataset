Well, you can live for the lifes on the stage, my friend 
 Play your music, while everyone's high 
 Dazzle the fans, with your fantastic hands 
 Leave 'em screamin' when you say goodbye 
 But the song in the night 
 When you're rollin' on 
 That's the one you just can't refuse 
 If you ain't gonna sing the gospel 
 Then you're gonna sing the blues 
 Well, you can paint with your words 
 You can sing like a bird 
 You can try to convince yourself 
 You can outright lie 
 Just to get yourself by 
 With your cold soul on the shelf 
 But if the song comes from some place that's real, my friend 
 You know there's only two ways to choose 
 If you ain't gonna sing the gospel 
 Then you're gonna sing the blues 
 If you ain't gonna sing the gospel 
 You're gonna sing the blues 
 No matter what rhythm 
 No matter what rhyme you choose 
 You might feel good up front my friend 
 But in the end, you'll lose 
 If you ain't gonna sing the gospel 
 Then you're gonna sing the blues 
 Well, if you grab a-hold of salvation 
 And let go of that foolin' around 
 Let the Lord Jesus show ya 
 What you've been missin' 
 Let your feet down on the rock solid ground 
 Then you'll find out the answers 
 To all your questions 
 There's a whole lot of good good news 
 And you'll be so filled up with the Spirit 
 You won't have room for blues 
 But if you ain't gonna sing the gospel 
 You're gonna sing the blues 
 No matter what rhythm 
 No matter what rhyme you choose 
 It might feel good up front my friend 
 But in the end, you'll lose 
 If you ain't gonna sing the gospel 
 If you ain't gonna sing the gospel 
 Then you're gonna sing the blues

Oh, if you're thirsty 
 Come to the water 
 You that have no money 
 Come, buy and eat! 
 Wine, milk and honey 
 Come now and feed 
 Your soul and your spirit 
 With all that you need 
 His ways are the ways of the truth and perfection 
 They're not like the ways of a man 
 His thoughts are the thoughts of a stranger to you 
 But listen, and you’ll understand 
 You'll fill up your belly with goodness 
 If you'll live by his word every day 
 And your soul will rejoice in its fatness 
 Every step of the way 
 Oh, if you're thirsty 
 Come to the water 
 You that have no money 
 Come, buy and eat! 
 Wine, milk and honey 
 Come now and feed 
 Your soul and your spirit 
 With all that you need 
 Now, why do you spend all your money 
 Still you’re hungry deep inside? 
 Why will you work your long life away 
 And you're still not satisfied? 
 Why not change the life you've been livin' 
 Just forget it and leave it behind 
 Return to the Lord; in his mercy, he’ll give you 
 The pardon you’re needin' to find 
 Oh, if you’re thirsty 
 Come to the water 
 You that have no money 
 Come, buy and eat! 
 Wine, milk and honey 
 Come now and feed 
 Your soul and your spirit 
 With all that you need 
 Oh, if you’re thirsty 
 Come to the water 
 You that have no money 
 Come, buy and eat! 
 Wine, milk and honey 
 Come now and feed 
 Your soul and your spirit 
 With all that you need

Now some people 
 When you walk up and talk to 'em 
 They wear this manufactured smile 
 You can't tell if they're really happy 
 Or just tryin' to be in style 
 Ya know it's like somebody told 'em 
 Only sinners have a frown 
 Hey, but when you're really hurtin' 
 It ain't no crime for bein' down 
 Now, obedience 
 That means sufferin' 
 And to some, that maybe news 
 Jesus paid our lifetime membership 
 But ya still gotta pay some dues 
 So when all Job's comforters 
 Are standin' round you 
 And your prayers just seem refused 
 Don't ya lie about your troubles 
 It ain't no sin, to get the blues 
 Now, some folks they really dig self pity 
 But others make it clear 
 That if it were possible 
 They'd rewrite the epistles and the apostles 
 So that, nobody, nobody, nobody ever had to shed a tear 
 But everybody gotta suffer sometimes 
 We all gotta work out our salvation on our own 
 Jesus never told ya, 
 He'd a-never got a hold o' you 
 He said, I'll never leave ya, never leave you all alone 
 So when you feel those tears start rollin' 
 Don't you go and get yourself all confused 
 Cause He'll dry those tears if you just go ahead and cry 'em 
 It ain't no sin, to get the blues 
 Now, you can say you're doin' fine 
 Say there's nothin' on your mind 
 Denounce it and deny it 
 Stick your hand out into sin 
 Try to make out like you're some kind o' superman 
 But ain't nobody, nobody, nobody really gonna buy it 
 Cause everybody gotta suffer sometimes 
 We all got to work out, to work out, to work out our salvation on our own 
 Jesus never told ya, 
 He'd a-never got a hold o' you 
 He said, I'l never, never leave you all alone 
 So when you feel those tears start rollin' 
 Don't you go and get yourself all confused 
 Cause He'll dry those tears if you just go ahead and cry 'em 
 It ain't no sin, to get the blues 
 Dry those tears, if you just go ahead and cry 'em 
 It ain't no sin, to get the blues

Now Jesus fasted forty days and when it was done 
 The devil came and said, "So you think that you're the one? 
 Well, if you're God's son, turn these stones to bread." 
 But Jesus was ready, and this is what he said 
 It is 
 You shall not live by bread alone 
 It is 
 You shall not live by bread alone 
 It is written 
 You shall not live by bread alone 
 It is written 
 But by every word of God's heavenly throne 
 It is written 
 So don't you try those lies on me 
 Then the devil took Jesus to the temple's height 
 Said, "If you're the one, go on and prove you're right 
 Jump and the angels gonna stop your fall." 
 Jesus said, "Yeah, they would now, but that's not all." 
 It is 
 You shall not test the Lord your God 
 It is 
 You shall not test the Lord your God 
 It is written 
 You shall not test the Lord your God 
 It is written 
 You shall not test the Lord your God 
 It is written 
 So don't you try those lies on me 
 When the devil took Jesus to a mountain high 
 Made all of the kingdoms of the world pass by 
 Said, "This can all be yours if you'll worship me." 
 Jesus said, "No way that that'll ever be." 
 'Cause it is written 
 You shall serve and worship God alone 
 It is written 
 You shall serve and worship God alone 
 It is written 
 You shall serve and worship God alone 
 It is written 
 You shall serve and worship God alone 
 It is written 
 So don't you try those lies on me 
 Now, forgive me for repeatin' what you know is right 
 But if there's words in you, well that's most of the fight 
 And when the enemy comes with a hook and a line 
 Speak the word that you've planted in your heart and your mind 
 It is written 
 I've been forgiven and given his righteousness 
 It is written 
 Every promise in the Word to me is 'yes' 
 It is written 
 All of his plans for me are for good 
 It is written 
 My Father loves me, it's understood 
 It is written 
 So don't you try those lies on me 
 It is written 
 There is no temptation but what's common to man 
 It is written 
 I can do all things through Christ, I can 
 It is written 
 By the power and love and the sound mind too 
 It is written 
 With my eyes on the cross, I'll turn my back on you 
 It is written 
 So don't you try those lies on me 
 Said, I know that it's written 
 So don't try those lies on me

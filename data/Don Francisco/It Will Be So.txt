When He says, "Come here," 
 Then you come 
 When He says, "Come quick," 
 Then you run 
 When He says, "Go there," 
 Then you go 
 And when He speaks His word 
 You know it will be so 
 Now, the captain of a hundred men 
 Had a servant who was just like a friend 
 But he was hurtin', lying' paralysed 
 In pain, just about to die 
 Now this captain heard about Jesus' fame 
 And he believed in the Messiah's name 
 He sent some men to him without delay 
 And he told them all the words to say 
 Say, "I'm not worthy, Lord, to see your face 
 Or even less to ask you to my place 
 And there's no need to travel all this way 
 For my servant to be healed today 
 Because I am a man beaneath authority 
 I know it was the same for you and me 
 I obey from above every plan 
 And so does everyone at my command 
 When I say, "Come here," 
 Then he comes 
 When I say, "Come quick," 
 Then he runs 
 When I say, "Go there," 
 Then he goes 
 And when you speak the word 
 I know it will be so 
 When Jesus heard what this man had to say 
 He just stopped stock still in the way 
 He said, "Nobody's had faith this great 
 And this is something I appreciate 
 So take a word to your captain from me 
 As you believe now so it's gonna be." 
 When they got back to the house it was true 
 God had done just what he said he Would do 
 Now the point of the story at hand 
 Even Jesus was impressed by a man 
 Who really understood that when you obey 
 There's power in what you do and say 
 You shouldn't need my help to see 
 That God's the ultimate authority 
 And today there is no chain of command 
 We're taking orders right straight from the man 
 When He says, "Come here," 
 Then you come 
 When He says, "Come quick," 
 Then you run 
 When He says, "Go there," 
 Then you go 
 And when you speak His word 
 You know it will be so 
 When He says, "Come here," 
 Then you come 
 When He says, "Come quick," 
 Then you run 
 When He says, "Go there," 
 Then you go 
 And when you speak His word 
 You know it will be so

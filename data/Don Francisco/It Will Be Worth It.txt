Get your hand off that doorbell I've bolted the door 
 I don't want what you're sellin' I've seen it before 
 I've had enough of your blind men and their sermons in stone 
 I don't play co-dependent, I'd just as soon be alone 
 Don't try to get in my pockets Or tell me how much I owe 
 Don't wanna hear that I'm guilty I already know 
 I won't answer your survey I sure won't give you my phone 
 I can't take more religion I'd just as soon be alone 
 I swear that I've heard every con game that's come down the line 
 I've been fooled by a few, but I learned how to read all the signs 
 Now these cards are my own, and my only stake left is my soul 
 And I won't show my hand till I know what you've got in the hole 
 So stay out of my pockets I don't need your money 
 There's so much that I owe Full payment's been made 
 This guilt is so heavy You're already forgiven 
 I'm in shackles, I know Your release has been paid 
 I've had enough of these jokers There's no one between us 
 But it's so hard alone You don't have to be 
 I can't take more religion There's no hidden agenda 
 I just want to go home If you'll come home to Me 
 There are armies of angels awaiting my every command 
 What can you give me that's not already here in My hand? 
 Don't you see that it's not what you've got or the things you can do? 
 I just want to spend all of eternity living with you 
 I don't need your money I don't care what you've done 
 I just want you to know Me 
 I don't carry a badge or a club or a gun 
 It's you I've been longing for 
 It's you I'm waitin' to see 
 All I've done will be worth it 
 If you'll come home to me 
 It's you I've been longing for 
 It's you I'm waitin' to see 
 And the Cross will be worth it 
 When you come home to me.

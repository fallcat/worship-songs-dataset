It's your own fault - you went ahead and did it 
 It's your own fault - can't blame no one but y'self 
 It's your own fault - you went ahead and did it 
 No matter how you wanna you can't blame nobody else. 
 Everyone's an expert at passin' the buck 
 Blamin' society, parents and luck 
 We're pointin' our fingers, blamin' our tools 
 Somebody else is gonna look like a fool. 
 "The devil made me do it," I heard somebody said 
 "Or maybe it was God himself, instead." 
 Even John Calvin's turnin' over in his grave 
 Hearin' all our excuses for the way we behave 
 Now I hear you been wond'rin' 
 Why the heaven's turned to brass - 
 Well, there ain't no point in lookin' 
 For the snake in the grass 
 Don't yell at your wife, and don't kick the cat 
 Just tell God the truth - 
 You know He'll listen to that 
 Say, "It's my own fault. I went ahead and did it 
 It's my own fault - can't blame no one but myself 
 It's my own fault, I went ahead and did it 
 No matter how I wanna I can't blame nobody else."

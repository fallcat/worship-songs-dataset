Now, Jehoshaphat was king in Jerusalem 
 A long, long time ago 
 When the children o' Judah 
 All worshipped the Lord 
 From the high on down to the low 
 Judah was a wealthy kingdom 
 Everybody's children were fed 
 Because Jehoshaphat studied the word of the Lord 
 And did everything He said 
 But out of the east came an army one day 
 After Jehoshaphat's gold 
 They were marchin' right straight to Jerusalem 
 And Jehoshaphat soon was told 
 So he called all the people together 
 And everybody fasted and prayed 
 The Lord God answered the people and He said 
 "There's no need for you to be afraid" 
 'Cause the battle is Mine tomorrow 
 It's not yours and it's not the king's 
 And all you gotta do is just stand and watch 
 To see the salvation I bring 
 Just believe that what I've told ya 
 Is exactly what I'm gonna do 
 And go out tomorrow against them 
 Because the Lord's gonna fight for you 
 Great jumpin' Jehoshaphat! 
 The army rose early next mornin' 
 They marched on out with the king 
 Jehoshaphat chose some singers 
 He told those singers to sing 
 And they praised the beauty of holiness 
 Instead of shoutin' out a battle cry 
 And all the way down to the enemy's camp 
 They sang to the Lord on high 
 They were singin 
 "Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord our God 
 His mercy will never end" 
 The Lord God set up an ambush 
 He got the enemy all turned around 
 And they started into killin' each other ya know 
 'Til they all lay dead on the ground 
 And the riches and the jewels that they left behind 
 It took 'em three whole days to haul 
 The children o' Judah all praised the Lord 
 'Cause He'd saved them one and all 
 And they were singin... 
 "Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord our God 
 His mercy will never end" 
 If the parallel's not real obvious now 
 I'll spell it right out for you 
 When you see trouble comin' to rip you off 
 Here's all that you need to do 
 Pray to your Heavenly Father 
 And believe that His word is true 
 And then step out and shout the salvation of God 
 'Cause He'll win that battle for you 
 And praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord our God 
 His mercy will never end 
 It'll never end 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 For His mercy endures forever and ever 
 Praise ye the Lord our God 
 His mercy will never end

Praise the Lord, hallelu! 
 I don't care what the devil's gonna do 
 The word and faith is my sword and shield 
 Jesus is Lord of the way I feel 
 Praise the Lord, hallelu! 
 I don't care what the devil's gonna do 
 The word and faith is my sword and shield 
 Jesus is Lord of the way I feel 
 Though the fig tree shall not blossom 
 Though there be no grapes upon the vine 
 Though the olive tree shall cast its fruit 
 And the field shall yield no grain to grind 
 Though the flock shall all be scattered 
 And there be no cattle in the stall 
 The Lord is still my joy and strength 
 By His word, He'll change it all 
 Praise the Lord, hallelu! 
 I don't care what the devil's gonna do 
 The word and faith is my sword and shield 
 Jesus is Lord of the way I feel 
 The Spirit of the Lord is here 
 And He has anointed me 
 To tell the news to everyone 
 He's here to set the captive free 
 So if you're brokenhearted 
 Tired of all the chains you wear 
 The Lord is here to heal you now 
 And break the power that holds you there 
 Praise the Lord, hallelu! 
 I don't care what the devil's gonna do 
 The word and faith is my sword and shield 
 Jesus is Lord of the way I feel 
 Praise the Lord, hallelu! 
 I don't care what the devil's gonna do 
 The word and faith is my sword and shield 
 Jesus is Lord of the way I feel 
 Praise the Lord, hallelu! 
 I really don't care what the devil's gonna do 
 The word and faith is my sword and shield 
 Jesus is Lord of the way I feel 
 Praise the Lord, hallelu! 
 I couldn't care less what the devil's gonna do 
 The word and faith is my sword and shield 
 Jesus is Lord of the way I feel

You, my friends, are all my scorners 
 And it seems your words of wind will have no end 
 While my adversary charges 
 Like a monster with its teeth he tear and rends 
 My face is streaked with weeping 
 And the darkness of my death is on my eyes 
 Like a prey I've fled and fallen 
 In the dust I crawl and have no strength to rise 
 If I've turned my steps to vanity 
 Or spoken in deceit the words of sin 
 I would be the first to tell you 
 And agree that I deserve this pain I'm in 
 But of sin I am not guilty 
 And the prayer from deep within my heart is pure 
 And for as long as life is in me 
 I will hold that my integrity is sure 
 I have sensed His sound and shadow 
 But I turn and look and He's no longer there 
 In futility I have sought Him 
 If you know the place He's hiding, tell me where 
 For if I could only find Him 
 I would bring my case for justice to His throne 
 I would lay it all before Him 
 And my righteousness would once for all be known 
 I'd demand the whole indictment 
 I would wear it like a crown before His face 
 Like a prince I would approach Him 
 And declare that my accuser has no case 
 And I call the earth to witness 
 Cover not by blood until God hears my cry 
 Let this wrong be still remembered 
 Till at last there is an answer from on high 
 Let this wrong be still remembered 
 Till at last there is an answer from on high

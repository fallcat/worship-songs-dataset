Man who is born of a woman 
 Flowers and then fades away 
 He flees like a shadow at sunset 
 In a lifetime as short as the day 
 And there is hope for a stump that is severed 
 Though its root grows old in the earth 
 At the first scent of water it wakens 
 And branches come out in new birth 
 But man, he lies down, and where is he? 
 The mourners, they grieve and they weep 
 But from then till the end of the ages 
 He will not awake from his sleep 
 But oh! That my pain would be written 
 With lead and a steel-pointed pen 
 Forever engraved into granite 
 That my words would endure to the end 
 And though the cry of my heart goes unanswered 
 When the breath flees away from these bones 
 In my grave I will wait in this knowledge 
 In my flesh I will see You alone 
 You, I know I shall see God my Savior 
 I will look on Him just as He is 
 And at last we will stand here together 
 For I know my Redeemer lives 
 Now my days they go by like a runner 
 Like ships driven hard by the wind 
 Like an eagle that swoops on its quarry 
 They rush to my death at the end 
 Though I wash me in crystal clear water 
 Though I cleanse all my fingers with lye 
 In the fierce holy light of Your presence 
 My uncleanness will stink to the sky 
 Turn away, then Your gaze and Your terror 
 Till I go to the darkness unseen 
 For You're not like a man I can answer 
 And there's no one to stand in between 
 There's no one, no one to stand in between 
 Man who is born of a woman 
 Flowers and then fades away 
 He flees like a shadow at sunset 
 In a lifetime as short as the day.

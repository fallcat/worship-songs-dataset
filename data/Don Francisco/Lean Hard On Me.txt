Lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 I'll stand the strain 
 I'll break the chains 
 And set your soul free 
 Lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 Don't be afraid 
 I am the rock 
 Lean hard on me 
 There's a rock that has never been shaken 
 A rock that's so mighty and high 
 Unmoved since the days of the prophets 
 And ages gone by 
 The cornerstone and the foundation 
 Who was and who is and will be 
 That rock is your friend and your brother 
 So lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 I'll break the chains 
 I'll take the pain 
 And set your soul free 
 Lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 Don't be afraid 
 I am the rock 
 Lean hard on me 
 When you stand on the words I command you 
 Sometimes you'll stand on your own 
 Friends who were there in fair weather 
 Will leave you alone 
 No matter the depth of the darkness 
 Wherever you are, I will be 
 So don't let your heart be troubled 
 Lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 I'll stand the strain 
 I'll take the pain 
 And set your soul free 
 Lean hard on me 
 Lean hard on me 
 Don't be afraid 
 I am the rock 
 Lean hard on me 
 Don't be afraid 
 I am the rock 
 Lean hard on me

Carried that burden 'bout long enough 
 It's time to let it ride 
 Carried that burden 'bout long enough 
 It's time to let it ride 
 Carried that burden 'bout long enough 
 It's time to let it ride Ooh-hoo let it ride 
 Worryin' 'bout tomorrow' 
 Cause the money's way too small 
 Worryin' 'bout the future 
 This ol' world's just bound to fall 
 Now, if you're anxious enough about it 
 Can you make yourself grow tall? 
 Well, that's just about the same 
 So let it ride 
 Let it ride on the promise 
 Of the One Who's always true 
 Let it ride on believin' that 
 He's goin' to see you through 
 Let it ride on the shoulders 
 Of the Man Who died for you 
 Just roll it all on Him and then let it ride 
 Now if you heed the Holy Spirit 
 There'll be peace down in your soul 
 When you put His business first 
 He'll never leave you in a hole 
 And He knows before you tell Him 
 About the stuff you can't control- 
 But just tell Him anyway 
 And then let it ride 
 Carried that burden 'bout long enough 
 [Lord Jesus, You know 
 I'm tired of haulin' this thing around] 
 Carried that burden 'bout long enough 
 (I know You've got a better way) 
 Carried that burden 'bout long enough 
 (I believe You know what to do with it) 
 Ooh-hoo let it ride.

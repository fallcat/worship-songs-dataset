When I heard you call me I could not say no 
 And the joy that you've given I can't help but show 
 And I feel it grow stronger each time I obey 
 To fulfill to your commandment, I stand here today 
 My brothers and my sisters are here by my side 
 As I show all who watch me that old things have died 
 I'm buried with Jesus like a seed that's been sown 
 And I'm raised up with him to his heavenly throne 
 Let the waters roll over my sin and desire 
 Baptise me in Spirit, baptise me in fire 
 In the name of the Father, the Spirit, the Son 
 My old life has ended, the new has begun 
 So baptise me now, 'cause I'm ready to die 
 And I'm ready to live for my master on high 
 'Til spirit and soul from this body divide 
 Or until he returns like a thief for his bride 
 Let the waters roll over my sin and desire 
 Baptise me in Spirit, baptise me in fire 
 In the name of the Father, the Spirit, the Son 
 My old life has ended, the new has begun 
 So baptise me now, 'cause I'm ready to die 
 And I'm ready to live for my master on high 
 'Til spirit and soul from this body divide 
 Or until he returns like a thief for his bride 
 Let the waters roll over my sin and desire 
 Baptise me in Spirit, baptise me in fire 
 In the name of the Father, the Spirit, the Son 
 My old life has ended: the new has begun 
 My old life has ended: the new has begun

Let your light shine 
 So the world will know 
 That God's in you 
 Everywhere you go 
 Let your light shine 
 So the world can see 
 I'm alive in you 
 You're alive in me 
 Like a lamp that fills 
 A room with light 
 Or a town on top 
 Of a hill at night 
 So my life in you 
 Makes darkness flee 
 And it draws the lost 
 And alone to me 
 Let your light shine 
 So the world will know 
 That God's in you 
 Everywhere you go 
 Let your light shine 
 So the world can see 
 I'm alive in you 
 You're alive in me 
 Like a lamp that fills 
 A room with light 
 Or a town on top 
 Of a hill at night 
 So my life in you 
 Makes darkness flee 
 And it draws the lost 
 And alone to me 
 It's the Word of God 
 We declare to you 
 That God is love 
 And his love is true 
 And when we walk in love 
 And in unity 
 Then the light of God 
 Shines from you 
 It shines from you and me 
 Like a lamp that fills 
 A room with light 
 Or a town on top 
 Of a hill at night 
 So my life in you 
 Makes darkness flee 
 And it draws the lost 
 And alone to me 
 Let your light shine 
 So the world will know 
 That God's in you 
 Everywhere you go 
 Let your light shine 
 So the world can see 
 I'm alive in you 
 You're alive in me

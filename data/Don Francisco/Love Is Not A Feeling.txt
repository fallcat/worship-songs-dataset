So you say you can't take it 
 The price is too high 
 Your feelings have gone 
 It seems your river's run dry 
 You never imagined 
 It could turn out so rough 
 You give and give and give 
 And still it's never enough 
 Your emotions have vanished 
 It once held a thrill 
 The wonder of love 
 Could be alive in you still 
 The ring on your finger 
 Is put there to stay 
 You'll never forget 
 The words you promised that day 
 Jesus didn't die for you 
 Because it was fun 
 He hung there for love 
 Because it had to be done 
 And in spite of the anguish 
 His work was fulfilled 
 Cause love is not a feelin' 
 It's an act of your will 
 Love is not a feelin' 
 It's an act of your will 
 Now I wouldn't try to tell you 
 That it's easy to stand 
 Satan's throwin' everything 
 That's at his command 
 But Jesus is faithful 
 His promise is true 
 And the things that He asks 
 He gives the power to do 
 You know He didn't die for you 
 Because it was fun 
 He hung there for love 
 Because it had to be done 
 And in spite of the anguish 
 His work was fulfilled 
 Cause love is not a feelin' 
 It's an act of your will 
 Love is not a feelin' 
 It's an act of your will 
 Love is not a feelin' 
 It's an act of your will

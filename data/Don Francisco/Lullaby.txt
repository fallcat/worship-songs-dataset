Darkness covers all the land 
 Sounds of day are gone 
 But love is all around you now 
 And will be 'til the dawn 
 So there's no need to be afraid 
 All the whole night through 
 'Cause God has made a promise, child 
 That He'll take care of you 
 Stars shine on the window sill 
 The moon shines through the trees 
 Angels by your bed tonight 
 Shine where no one sees 
 And all that you've been dreamin' of 
 Awaits you when you rise 
 So with the peace that Jesus brings 
 Close your sleepy eyes 
 Stars shine on the window sill 
 The moon shines through the trees 
 Angels by your bed tonight 
 Shine where no one sees 
 And all that you've been dreamin' of 
 Awaits you when you rise 
 So with the peace that Jesus brings 
 Close your sleepy eyes

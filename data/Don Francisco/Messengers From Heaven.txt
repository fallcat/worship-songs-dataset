I brought your fathers out of bondage to the richness of this land, 
 And they knew and praised the One who gave them everything they had; 
 But now their children`s children`s children take their lives into their hands; 
 They put their faith in flesh and blood, and hope in wind and sand. 
 But the messengers of heaven now are moving through the land, 
 And everything that´s said and done they see and understand. 
 And if one man in a thousand can be found to follow Me, 
 Then, for the sake of only one, I`ll let the others be. 
 You worship what your hands have made in gold and steel and stone 
 As if your souls could be contained by all the things you own; 
 And you praise Me with your lips alone – and bury love inside 
 Your hardened hearts that beat for lust and cannot feel for pride. 
 But the messengers of heaven now are moving through the land, 
 And everything that´s said and done they see and understand. 
 And if one man in a thousand can be found to follow Me, 
 Then, for the sake of only one, I`ll let the others be. 
 The prophet in the marketplace speaks strange and different tongues 
 And he cries aloud to every man:  ‘The judgement has begun!’ 
 But if you’ll just believe his word and turn from all your sin, 
 I`ll heal your land of all its hurts and bless you once again. 
 And the messengers of heaven now are moving through the land…” 
 Everything that´s said and done they see and understand. 
 And if one man in a thousand can be found to follow Me, 
 Then, for the sake of only one, I`ll let the others be. 
 The messengers of heaven now are moving through the land; 
 Everything that´s said and done they see and understand. 
 And if one man in a thousand can be found to follow Me, 
 Then, for the sake of only one, I`ll let the others be.

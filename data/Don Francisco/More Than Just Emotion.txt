You've made me yours forever 
 You've given me your Word 
 Your Spirit lives inside me 
 But sometimes the picture's blurred 
 I remember things you've done for me 
 So much love and grace 
 It's like reading old love letters 
 When I long to see your face. 
 And it's more than just emotion 
 When your power and love come down 
 It's why everyone around your throne 
 Keeps casting down their crowns. 
 Crying 'Holy!' all of heaven stands amazed 
 They cry 'Holy!' singing out eternal praise 
 And we sing 'Holy!' in the earth and heaven above 
 We sing 'Holy!': fill our hearts with your love. 
 As we worship in your presence 
 You set every heart aflame 
 Igniting every voice and tongue 
 To exult your holy name. 
 And it's more than just emotion 
 When your power and love come down; 
 It's why everyone around your throne 
 Keeps casting down their crowns. 
 We all sing 'Holy!' in the earth and heaven above 
 We sing 'Holy!', and our hearts are filled with love. 
 We sing 'Holy!', and our hands and voices raise; 
 We sing 'Holy!' as you descend upon our praise. 
 We sing 'Holy!' in the earth and heaven above 
 We sing 'Holy!', and our hearts are filled with love. 
 We sing 'Holy!', and our hands and voices raise; 
 We sing 'Holy!' as you rest upon our praise. 
 As we worship in your presence 
 You set every heart aflame 
 Igniting every voice and tongue 
 To exult your holy name.

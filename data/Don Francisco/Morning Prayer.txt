As I sit down before you this mornin' 
 With the Bible in front of me here 
 I pray that You'll help me to listen 
 And to understand all that I hear 
 To remember that You are my Father 
 And the love Jesus gave when He died 
 Let the power that You showed when You raised Him 
 Remove any doubt that's inside 
 Wash me with Your livin' water 
 Feed me with Your livin' word 
 Fill me with Your Holy Spirit 
 And then help me to do what I've heard 
 Protect me from words of the liar 
 Deceptions that seem they're from You 
 Meanings You never intended 
 Give me wisdom to see what is true 
 And equip me today for the Bible 
 With strength and the armor of light 
 With the joy of the victor inside me 
 To shine through the day and the night 
 Wash me with Your livin' water 
 Feed me with Your livin' word 
 Fill me with Your Holy Spirit 
 And help me to do what I've heard 
 Wash me with Your livin' water 
 Feed me with Your livin' water 
 Fill me with Your Holy Spirit 
 And then help me to do what I've heard 
 Wash me with Your livin' water 
 Feed me with Your livin' water 
 Fill me with Your Holy Spirit 
 And then help me to do what I've heard

I was born in the city, with all that that means - 
 Uprooted people, concrete and machines 
 But I never fit in, and I never knew why 
 "Till I stood on these mountains and under this sky 
 I rode out this mornin', wood-smoke on the breeze 
 Through white aspen forests 'n' shimmerin' leaves 
 On a horse that I've known since the day of his birth 
 My head in the clouds, as his hooves pound the earth 
 The air in the Rockies right after the rain 
 Gives peace to my soul and erases my pain 
 The herd out before me and the reins in my hand 
 I'm in my blood's country and my heart's pastureland 
 The world that I left, now, the mem'ries remain 
 But these forests and canyons are the life in my veins, my heart 
 Knows no regrets, in the day or my dreams - 
 It sins in the meadows, and it laughs in the streams 
 The afternoon sun's turned the granite to gold 
 Shinin' under the stormclouds as eastward they roll 
 With raindrops like diamonds on the sage and the trees 
 If I weren't in the saddle, I'd give thanks on my knees 
 The air in the Rockies right after the rain 
 Gives peace to my soul and erases my pain 
 The herd out before me and the reins in my hand 
 I'm in my blood's country and my heart's pastureland 
 We're a vanishing breed, it's a cowboy clich√© 
 'A job done for love -- it sure ain't for the pay 
 The pastures keep shrinkin', the fences grow long 
 All that's left are the movies ... and this cowboy's song 
 But I'll follow this herd while the night follows day 
 Till my body lies down and my soul flies away 
 In these hard rocky mountains I'll make my last stand 
 Somewhere in the sunset southwest of the Cheyenne 
 The air in the Rockies right after the rain 
 Gives peace to my soul and erases my pain 
 The herd out before me and the reins in my hand 
 I'm in my blood's country and my heart's pastureland 
 With the mountains before me and the reins in my hand 
 I'm in my blood's country and my heart's pastureland 
 I'm in my blood's country and my heart's pastureland.

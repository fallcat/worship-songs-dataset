My Jesus, I love you, I know you are mine. 
 For you all the follies of sin I’ve resigned 
 My gracious redeemer, my saviour art thou 
 If ever I loved you, my Jesus, it’s now. 
 I love you because you have first loved me 
 And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree. 
 I love you for wearing the thorns on your brow 
 If ever I loved you, my Jesus, it’s now. 
 I love you in life, and I will love you through deaf; 
 I’ll praise you as long as you lend me my breath. 
 And say, when I see you, through cheers as I bow, 
 If ever I loved you, my Jesus, it’s now. 
 In mansions of glory and endless delight 
 I’ll ever adore thee, in heaven so bright. 
 I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow 
 If ever I loved you, my Jesus, it’s now. 
 I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow 
 If ever I loved you, my Jesus, it’s now.

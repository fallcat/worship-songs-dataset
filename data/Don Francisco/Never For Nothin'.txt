In a bare little room 
 Down the hallway 
 He types out the words all alone 
 Manuscript grows on the harddrive 
 Vision the world's never known 
 Travelin' with only a compass 
 Drawing a map with his words 
 'Til his head meets his arm on the table 
 And sleep takes the eyes that had blurred 
 She's old and a little unsteady 
 As she makes her way down to the town 
 But the peace in her soul is the feeling 
 She leaves with the people around 
 Words of compassion and kindness 
 Really listening to hear what they say 
 'Til she walks slowly home in the evening 
 Alone at the end of the day 
 But it's never for nothin' 
 When it comes from the heart 
 Love's the end of the matter 
 When it's there at the start 
 To the hardened, it's hopeless 
 To the world, it's not smart 
 But it's never for nothin' 
 When it comes from the heart 
 Everyone's marching in rhythm 
 With crowds growing larger each day 
 His friends have all warned him to silence 
 "You'll be hurt if you get in the way." 
 Slowly, he gathers his courage 
 And stands to his feet on the floor 
 And his truth shows up all their deceptions 
 He's soon shouted down with a roar 
 But it's never for nothin' 
 When it comes from the heart 
 Love's the end of the matter 
 When it's there at the start 
 To the hardened, it's hopeless 
 To the world, it's not smart 
 But it's never for nothin' 
 When it comes from the heart 
 Deep in the earth in the darkness 
 Unnoticed by all on the ground 
 The life that was planted is growing 
 For the stones that cannot hold it down 
 Few may remember your sowing 
 When it's time for the harvest at last 
 The seed that holds the power of heaven 
 Is a promise that will come to pass 
 It's never for nothin' 
 When it comes from the heart 
 Love's the end of the matter 
 When it's there at the start 
 To the hardened, it's hopeless 
 To the world, it's not smart 
 But it's never for nothin' 
 When it comes from the heart 
 It's never for nothin' 
 When it comes from the heart

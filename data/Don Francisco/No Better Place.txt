There is no better place 
 Than to be here and to look upon your face 
 In your church or all alone 
 No better place than to be before your throne 
 God of comfort, Lord of mercy 
 Love that knows no bounds 
 I adore you, worship and bow down 
 Worship and bow down 
 There is no better place 
 Than to be here and to look upon your face 
 In your church or all alone 
 No better place than to be before your throne 
 God of comfort, Lord of mercy 
 Love that knows no bounds 
 I adore you, worship and bow down 
 Worship and bow down

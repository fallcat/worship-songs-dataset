I go back to old Jerusalem, and the man who ran that store 
 He was cheating all non-Arabs who would come inside his door 
 I felt the malice and the hatred, the sick joy in what he did 
 And in disgust I turned and quickly walked away 
 I'd seen it in his eyes; I'd heard it in his voice 
 A hatred that would wreak itself on me 
 But today I cannot turn and walk away 
 He's here to stay 
 I go back to old Jerusalem, and another Arab man 
 Who spoke with keen intelligence of history and the land 
 With wisdom in his words and ways, and kindness in his hands 
 And I wished that I had more time to stay 
 I saw it in his eyes, I heard it in his voice 
 A gentleness that started from the soul 
 And now I wish that I could hear what he would say 
 To me today 
 Maybe he'd explain the rage that drives the hearts and minds 
 Of the ones who've charred their consciences to enjoy some fratricide 
 Maybe he'd explain just what could make so many choose 
 To take their brothers with them screaming into hell 
 And believe that they were really doing well 
 Now back in old Jerusalem, there's just an empty store 
 And the blindness of jihad now runs red rivers out the door 
 So I cried at God for wisdom that would stop this flow of blood 
 And for courage and compassion that stand high against the flood 
 I've seen it in Jerusalem 
 You've seen it on the screen 
 So many filled with hatred, lies and fear 
 And today we can't forget and walk away 
 We've got to pray 
 No time left to walk or even look away 
 We've got to pray 
 I said, no time left to walk or even look away 
 We've got to pray

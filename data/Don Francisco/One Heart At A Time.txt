Everybody's lookin' for a hero 
 Everybody's waitin' on a big noise 
 Everybody's hopin' for a hot shot 
 Everybody's bettin' on the big boys 
 But they don't know 
 They don't see 
 It all comes down 
 To you and me 
 One heart at a time 
 One light to another 
 One heart at a time 
 Brother to brother 
 Everybody's hangin' on the healer 
 Everybody's pullin' at the preacher man 
 Everybody's lookin' for a leader 
 To save the world, they think it's only he who can 
 Why don't they know? 
 Why don't they see? 
 God gave His power 
 To you and me 
 One heart at a time 
 One light to another 
 One heart at a time 
 Brother to brother 
 To fields are right to harvest 
 They're ready don't ya know 
 But if everybody's just sittin' 'round waitin' 
 Tell me, who is gonna go? 
 The other man of God you've ever heard 
 Everyone began 
 Just holdin' on to Jesus 
 Reachin' out to just one Man 
 One heart at a time 
 One light to another 
 Just one heart at a time 
 Brother to brother 
 One heart at a time 
 One light to another 
 One heart at a time 
 Brother to brother 
 One heart at a time 
 One light to another 
 One heart at a time 
 Brother to brother

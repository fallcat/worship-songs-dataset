One thing I ask of the Lord 
 Just one thing will I seek 
 That I may dwell in the presence of the Lord 
 All the days of my life 
 Better is a day in your courts, O Lord 
 Than a thousand spent any other place 
 I'd rather be a doorman in the presence of the Lord 
 Than a king from whom you turn and hide your face 
 One thing I ask of the Lord 
 Just one thing will I seek 
 That I may dwell in the presence of the Lord 
 All the days of my life 
 You alone are my fortress and my strength 
 There's shelter in the safety of your wings 
 When trouble comes against me, you will hide me in your arms 
 And show the world the reason that I sing 
 One thing I ask of the Lord 
 Just one thing will I seek 
 That I may dwell in the presence of the Lord 
 All the days of my life 
 That I may dwell in the presence of the Lord 
 All the days of my life

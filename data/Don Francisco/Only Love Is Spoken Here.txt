There is a temple without walls 
 Marble columns or polished halls 
 Built upon the living stone 
 Made for you, and you alone 
 It isn't far from where you stand 
 Distracted by this world's demands 
 Just inside, and up the stair 
 A friend is sitting, waiting there 
 You can leave your cares behind 
 Empty chatter of your mind 
 Come and rest; no need to fear 
 Only love is spoken here 
 Only love is spoken here 
 Words, like arrows, take their toll 
 The enemy attempts control 
 Dark clouds blow across the soul 
 But through each storm, the anchor holds 
 So you can leave the past behind 
 The anxious turning of your mind 
 Come and rest; no need to fear 
 Only love is spoken here 
 Only love is spoken here 
 Now nothing shakes the peace within 
 A place that can't be touched by sin 
 For through it all, both day and night 
 The Spirit shines his holy light 
 Here in me, you stand complete 
 Except to let me wash your feet 
 So come and rest, no need to fear 
 Only love is spoken here 
 Only love is spoken here 
 Come and rest, no need to fear 
 Only love is spoken here

I am not the one who is to come 
 Nor am I Elijah, for that day is yet undone 
 But after me comes the man that every prophet spoke to see 
 And he has always been, before I ever came to be 
 I'm just a cry in the wilderness 
 A plea in the wilderness 
 Just a voice alone in the wilderness 
 Prepare the way for the Lord 
 All my life is meant for just this end 
 To tell the nation of the man on whom God's Spirit will descend 
 This is the one, God's holy and anointed only son 
 This will be the message 'til it has been done 
 I'm just a cry in the wilderness 
 A plea in the wilderness 
 Just a voice alone in the wilderness 
 Prepare the way for the Lord 
 Let every hill and mountain be brought down 
 Make the valleys and the canyons level ground 
 Let every crooked life be turned around 
 Prepare the way for the Lord 
 To baptise you with water is all I know 
 There stands one among you, and it's he I came to show 
 I'm just the crier 
 But he will end the kingdom of the liar 
 He will baptise you into his Spirit and his fire 
 I'm just a cry in the wilderness 
 A plea in the wilderness 
 Just a voice alone in the wilderness 
 Prepare the way for the Lord 
 I'm just a cry in the wilderness 
 A plea in the wilderness 
 Just a voice alone in the wilderness 
 Prepare the way for the Lord 
 Prepare the way for the Lord 
 Prepare the way for the Lord

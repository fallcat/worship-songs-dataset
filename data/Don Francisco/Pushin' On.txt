Nothin’ is slowin’ the way that I’m goin’ 
 I ain’t gonna pay it no mind 
 Whatever’s waitin’ and whatever’s comin’ 
 It’s all getting left behind 
 Forgetting the things that go by in the mirror 
 And reachin’ for heaven above 
 Not in the strength of the will of the flesh 
 But in faith that works by love 
 I’m pushing on, I’m pushing on 
 Pushin’ on, I’m pushin’ on 
 Now people are talking, I’m constantly hearing 
 That somebody else is going down 
 Turning aside, they’ve stumbled and lied 
 And everyone’s wearing a frown 
 Why are you watching what anyone’s doin’ 
 They’re all gonna fail in the end 
 There’s only one place worth fixin’ your eyes 
 It’s not on the world of men 
 I’m pushin’ on, I’m pushin’ on 
 I’m pushin’ on, pushin’ on 
 Now I’m gonna run with endurance the path in front of me 
 Leaving the burdens and cares 
 Casting aside every hindrance and weight 
 And all that would try to ensnare 
 Rememberin’ the one who endured the cross 
 Despising the shame and the sin 
 I haven’t resisted to blood 
 But I’m gonna make it through to the end 
 I’m pushin’ on, I’m pushin’ on 
 I’m pushin’ on, I’m pushin’ on 
 Now you can walk here beside me 
 Or wonder what’s happenin’ 
 But don’t try to get in the way 
 Because too many dying to spend my time tryin’ 
 To work through the games you play 
 There’s many who see what he’s called us to be 
 Keep his goal in front of your mind 
 Because no other call really matters at all 
 I hope you don’t think I’m unkind 
 But I’m pushin’ on, I’m pushin’ on 
 Pushin’ on, pushin’ on

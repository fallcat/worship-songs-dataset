I'm restin' in Jesus 
 Leanin' on the Lord 
 With the wind beneath the wings 
 Of Your Spirit, I will soar 
 The chains that held me once are gone 
 Lifted my love and I've been reborn 
 I'm restin' in Jesus 
 Leanin' on the Lord 
 Restin' in Jesus 
 Leanin' on the Lord 
 With the wind beneath the wings 
 Of Your Spirit, I will soar 
 All the chains that held me once are gone 
 Lifted by Your love, I've been reborn 
 I'm restin' in Jesus 
 Leanin' on the Lord 
 It really doesn't matter what the people say 
 'Cause I'm restin' in Jesus 
 Come whatever, come what may 
 'Cause I'm leanin' on the Lord 
 He won't let me fall away 
 'Cause I'm restin' in Jesus 
 Till He takes me home to stay 
 I'll be leanin' on the Lord 
 Restin' in Jesus 
 Leanin' on the Lord 
 With the wind beneath the wings 
 Of Your Spirit, I will soar 
 All the chains that held me once are gone 
 Lifted by Your love, I've been reborn 
 I'm restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Leanin' on the Lord (leaning on the Lord) 
 Fully persuaded, I have no doubt 
 When my time down here's run out 
 I've got a reservation on that heavenly plain 
 And it's all paid up in my Savior's Name 
 Restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Leanin' on the Lord (leaning on the Lord) 
 Risin' with the wind beneath the wings 
 Of Your Spirit, I will soar 
 All the chains that held me once are gone 
 Lifted by Your love, I've been reborn 
 Restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Leanin' on the Lord (leaning on the Lord) 
 Restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Worshipin' the Lord (leaning on the Lord) 
 Risin' with the wind beneath the wings 
 Of Your Spirit, I will soar 
 All the chains that held me once are gone 
 Lifted by Your love, I have been reborn 
 Restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Leanin' on the Lord (leaning on the Lord) 
 Restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Worshipin' the Lord (leaning on the Lord) 
 Risin' with the wind beneath the wings 
 Of Your Spirit, I will soar 
 All the chains that held me once are gone 
 Lifted by Your love, I've been reborn 
 Restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Leanin' on the Lord (leaning on the Lord) 
 Restin' in Jesus (resting in Jesus) 
 Leanin' on the Lord!

Lord, You and I know that 
 I gave 'em everything I had 
 Now I'm headin' for home 
 but again I'm feelin' angry and sad 
 I did my best to preach Your Word and sing 
 But they ripped off part of the offering 
 When you're dealin' with your brothers 
 You shouldn't have to feel so bad 
 Lord, I'm gonna keep tryin' 
 'Cause Your Body's in desperate need 
 But I get so tired of the abuse 
 the deceit, and the greed 
 it's what I expect from the world outside 
 But not from the men 
 Who're preparing Your Bride 
 And they keep gettin' fatter 
 While the sheep are just left to bleed 
 It's a righteous disgrace, it's a sin and a shame 
 All of this garbage in Jesus' name 
 I know we have to wait for You 
 To burn up the chaff 
 But what can we do for the sheep 
 When the wolves are on full-time staff? 
 O Lord, I wanna thank you 
 For every godly woman and man 
 For every pastor with a shepherd's heart 
 And clean, lovin' hands 
 Give 'em the strength that they need today 
 Answer every single prayer they pray 
 But come like a fire, Lord, burn the rest away 
 It's a righteous disgrace, it's a sin and a shame 
 All of this garbage in Jesus' name 
 I know we have to wait for You 
 To burn up the chaff 
 But what can we do for the sheep 
 When the wolves are on full-time staff? 
 Lord, You and I know that 
 I gave 'em everything I had 
 Now I'm headin' for home 
 But again I'm feelin' angry and sad 
 Angry for lies that were told in Your Name 
 Sad for the lack of repentance and shame 
 When you're dealin' with your brothers 
 You shouldn't have to feel so bad 
 When you're dealin' with your brothers 
 You shouldn't have to feel so bad

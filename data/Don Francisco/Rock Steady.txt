Like a house on a firm foundation 
 Rock steady, come what may 
 Is the one who trusts in Jesus 
 And follows what he says each day 
 Like a house on a firm foundation 
 Rock steady, come what may 
 Is the one who trusts in Jesus 
 And follows what he says each day 
 Follows what he says each day, that's right 
 If you're blind with the sense to know it 
 Don't follow somebody like you 
 You'll fall into a ditch and hurt yourself 
 And be blind and stupid, too 
 Because whoever you choose to follow 
 That's who you're gonna grow to be 
 So don't follow some earthly leader 
 If you really wanna learn to see 
 Like a house on a firm foundation 
 Rock steady, come what may 
 Is the one who trusts in Jesus 
 And follows what he says each day 
 Follows what he says each day, that's right 
 Why do you tell your neighbour 
 "You've got a speck there in your eye?" 
 When a two-by-four's stickin' out of your own 
 And you're as blind as a bat in the sky? 
 The law and the prophets, they all boil down 
 To just one simple fact 
 How you want others to deal with you 
 Is the way you ought to act 
 Like a house on a firm foundation 
 Rock steady, come what may 
 Is the one who trusts in Jesus 
 And follows what he says each day 
 Now you can't get figs from thistles 
 Or an apple from a Joshua tree 
 So don't ask somebody on the road to hell 
 What the way to heaven might be 
 Gotta take care who you listen to 
 Truth comes from the Holy Spirit 
 Keep your radio on and tune-in right 
 When he speaks, you can clearly hear it 
 Like a house on a firm foundation 
 Rock steady, come what may 
 Is the one who trusts in Jesus 
 And follows what he says each day 
 Follows what he says each day 
 Follows what he says each day 
 Follows what he says each day 
 It's the one who trusts and follows what he says 
 It's the one who trusts and follows what he says 
 It's the one who trusts and follows what he says 
 It's the one who trusts and follows what he says 
 Like a house on a firm foundation 
 Rock steady, come what may 
 Is the one who trusts in Jesus 
 And follows what he says each day 
 That's right

I wanna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 I wanna roll 
 My burdens on the Lord 
 I wanna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 Cause He knows 
 What to do, with my heavy load 
 When I'm down 
 And it feels like my friends have left me 
 There's someone there 
 He wants me to succeed 
 Gonna cast my cares on Him 
 Cause He loves me 
 His love flows like a river 
 Just like a river to my knees 
 That's why I wanna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 Don't ya know, I wanna roll 
 My burdens on the Lord 
 I wanna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 Cause He knows 
 What to do, with my heavy load 
 Just as far from the east is from the west, now 
 All my sins and failures they've been led away 
 My worried mind, I know I can't change a thing 
 Never change a thing 
 So I just hand it over, cause my Father is still the King 
 That's why I'm gonna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 I'm gonna roll 
 My burdens on the Lord 
 I'm gonna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 Cause He knows 
 What to do, with my heavy load 
 I'm gonna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 I'm gonna roll 
 My burdens on the Lord 
 Ya know, I'm gonna roll 
 My burdens on to Jesus 
 Cause He knows 
 What to do, yes, He knows what to do 
 Yeah, He knows what to do 
 With my heavy load

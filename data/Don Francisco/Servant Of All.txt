Zebedee's sons both came bowin' down low 
 They tried to tell Jesus how they thought it should go 
 "When you reign in your kingdom in power and might 
 Command that we'll sit on your left and your right." 
 But Jesus replied, "You just don't understand 
 What are you asking; oh, what a demand 
 And it isn't for me to decide or declare 
 Who'll take these places my Father's prepared." 
 And the other disciples got a little irate 
 At the two who'd finagled to be someone great 
 So Jesus explained to make sure it was clear 
 The Kingdom of God isn't like it is here 
 The Kingdom of God isn't like it is here 
 This world has its rulers that they dare not defy 
 When their leaders say 'Jump', people ask them 'How high?' 
 But that ambition to lead, put it out of your head 
 The way's not to climb; it's by kneeling instead 
 The way's not to climb; it's by kneeling instead 
 For I came from a throne that you cannot conceive 
 To live as a servant to all who believe 
 How is it you think you can follow me, then 
 And aim for a life as a leader of men? 
 That ambition to lead isn't something from God 
 It's a dream of the world; it's a cheat and a fraud 
 It will harden your heart 'til you're deaf to the call 
 That the greatest in heaven is the servant of all 
 The greatest in heaven is the servant of all 
 So don't be called 'teacher'; there's only the one 
 Don't be called 'father'; he's on the Throne 
 Don't be called 'leader'; it's my place alone 
 I am your Shepherd, and you are my own 
 The ambition to lead isn't something from God 
 It's a dream of the world; it's a cheat and a fraud 
 It will harden your heart 'til you're deaf to the call 
 That the greatest in heaven is the servant of all 
 The greatest in heaven is the servant of all 
 The greatest in heaven is the servant of all

I will wait for God alone 
 All my hope is in the Holy one. 
 You alone are my deliverer 
 And the refuge for my soul 
 And I will lay my heart before you 
 I will lift my hands and sing 
 And my soul will rest in confidence 
 In the shelter of your wings. 
 I will seek you in the morning 
 In this dry and weary land 
 From your throne comes living water 
 Loving kindness from your hand. 
 So I will lay my heart before you 
 I will lift my hands and sing 
 And my soul will rest in confidence 
 In the shelter of your wings 
 Blessed be the Lord almighty 
 Daily all our burdens bears 
 Our deliverer and saviour 
 Unto you I cast my cares 
 I will lay my heart before you 
 I will lift my hands and sing 
 And my soul will rest in confidence 
 In the shelter of your wings

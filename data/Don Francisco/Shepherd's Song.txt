It was frosty and clear as we huddled that night 'round the fire 
 We poked at the embers, watched as the sparks flew up higher 
 Then the fire seemed to dim as the air all around filled with light 
 We all stared in fear at the angel who dazzled our sight 
 He said, "Don't be afraid; I have not come to destroy 
 I've come with good news to announce indescribable joy 
 The Messiah is born: the saviour of all on the earth 
 And you are the ones God has chosen to witness his birth 
 Now, go to the city of David, just inside the wall 
 There's an inn, and behind in the barn by the animal stalls 
 There's a baby wrapped up in a feedpen they've used for his bed 
 When you find him, you'll know of the truth in all that I've said." 
 Then the sky just exploded with thousands of angels and light 
 And the sight and the sound of their music set fire to the night 
 Praise, honour, and glory to God in the highest 
 And mercy and peace and blessing to all of mankind 
 Praise, honour, and glory to God in the highest 
 And mercy and peace and blessing to all of mankind 
 So we went and we found the new baby as the angel had said 
 With Mary and Joseph from Nazareth there by his bed 
 Such peace and a sense of a presence gave warmth to the air 
 We fell to our knees in wonder to worship him there 
 Praise, honour, and glory to God in the highest 
 And mercy and peace and blessing to all of mankind 
 Praise, honour, and glory to God in the highest 
 And mercy and peace and blessing to all of mankind 
 Praise, honour, and glory to God in the highest 
 And mercy and peace and blessing to all of mankind 
 Praise, honour, and glory to God in the highest 
 And mercy and peace and blessing 
 Mercy and peace and blessing 
 Mercy and peace and blessing to all of mankind

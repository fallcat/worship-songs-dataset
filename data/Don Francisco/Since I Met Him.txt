Now it's hard to describe what my life used to be 
 To someone who's always been able to see. 
 You know I wasn't unhappy or bitter that way, 
 But everything's changed since I met Him that day. 
 I was down at the corner just passing the time, 
 Sitting in the sunlight and feeling it shine, 
 When the sound of a crowd began to grow in my ear, 
 So I waited and I listened as I heard them draw near. 
 Then a man stepped up to me and He spat on the ground. 
 He put the mud on my eyes and then He smeared it around. 
 Sent me off to Siloam to wash off the clay, 
 And I opened my eyes and I looked at the day. 
 And I have no idea how He did it, I just know what happened to me. 
 Yesterday I was in darkness, but since I met Him I can see. 
 When the Pharisees heard it they put me on trial, 
 Even called in my parents and grilled them awhile, 
 And when, at the end, I defended the man, 
 Who had opened my eyes, the troubles began. 
 I said "Ever since the beginning of time 
 No one's opened the eyes of someone born blind. 
 This man's sent from God, it just can't be denied" 
 And they cursed me and grabbed me and threw me outside. 
 I really don't know how He found me. I just know He was talking to me. 
 It was easy to tell by the sound of His voice He was the reason I see. 
 And as soon as He spoke to me I couldn't hide 
 The emotion that welled up from deep down inside 
 And combined in the dreams that He made to come true, to kneel there and worship was all I could do 
 And I called Him my Lord and Messiah 
 For everything He'd done for me. 
 Yesterday I was in darkness, 
 But since I met Him I can see. 
 And I call Him my Lord and my savior 
 For everything He's done for me. 
 Yesterday I was in darkness, 
 But since I met Him, 
 Since I met Him, 
 Since I met Him I can see. 
 Since I met Him, Messiah 
 Since I met Him, Messiah 
 Since I met Him I can see

Somebody been sneakin' round my back door 
 Bringin' back a bunch o' trash that I've thrown out before 
 They were stashin' it in the cellar, in the bedroom, too 
 And I was feelin' confused about what I oughta do 
 ‘Cause there was pride in the pantry, shame was under the stair 
 It seemed like lies were lurkin' everywhere 
 The harder I cleaned, the more filth I'd find 
 Just like there was some funky factory inside my mind 
 Then a good friend asked me, Man, are you still here? 
 There's no reason to live in this bondage and fear 
 Jesus paid for your freedom: it's so easy to find 
 You just walk in the Spirit, leave the law behind 
 But your push-broom down, get outta the door 
 There ain't nothin' here that you need anymore 
 Leave that big bag o' pride, and your carry-on, too 
 Hand the house-keys over to Jesus, they don't belong to you 
 Now some folks say you gotta wade right in 
 Grab a-hold o' that carcass, try to strangle the sin 
 But that's like goin' to Las Vegas tryin' to pay your debts 
 The harder you work, the deeper in you get 
 Because it's the Law that gives power to the sin in us 
 God's already forgiven every rotten sin that you will ever do 
 He left the Law in the grave when He rasied up His Son 
 So why you tryin' to redo what He's already done? 
 So now if somebody comes sneakin' round my back door 
 Tryin' to bring back all that garbage just like he did before 
 It ain't gonna work this time, ‘cause, try as hard as he can 
 He's gonna be dealin' with Jesus – ‘stead of a dead old man 
 Spoken 
 Say what? You got some sin that belongs to me? No, it don't to me. It belongs to Jesus. You go talk to Him, sees what He says. Say what? You say it's got my name on it? Let me see that. No, that's not me. That guy died way back in 1974. Everything he owned belongs to Jesus. You go talk to him, I got no business with you. Go on. No, no, uhuh, I don't believe that; go on.

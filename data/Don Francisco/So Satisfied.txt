You say there's more important things to do 
 And this stuff about followin' Jesus just ain't for you 
 But the Lord can change your mind 
 Make you glad you left it all behind 
 And open up your eyes to what's really real 
 Cause there ain't nothin' more important than to do the Father's will 
 Life ain't in a lady or a dollar or a pill 
 You won't get no satisfaction and I know because I've tried 
 But He's everything I'll ever need and I'm so satisfied 
 You say you just can't turn your life around 
 Some things you need you'd just rather not put down 
 But that's the horse behind the cart you know believin's the most important part 
 He can change your heart to want what's really real 
 The things I thought I had to have are things I've left behind 
 If you look for freedom other places chains are all you'll find 
 You won't get no satisfaction and I know because I've tried 
 But He's everything I'll ever need and I'm so satisfied 
 So satisfied 
 So satisfied 
 I ain't never, ever been so satisfied 
 Way down deep inside my soul 
 Oh, His love has made me whole 
 And I ain't never, ever been so satisfied 
 My family may forsake me 
 My friends may put me down 
 I might lose everything I have 
 But my God sticks around 
 No matter what's come down the road, He's never left my side 
 He's got everything I need and I'm so satisfied

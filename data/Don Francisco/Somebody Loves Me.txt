Puttin' on the stand 
 While my life turned out so wrong 
 She knew how much I loved her 
 But she told me to be movin' on 
 She said she just wanted me to go away 
 The lawyer found the papers yesterday 
 And I was rollin' down the road 
 'Cause she told me, she just didn't love me 
 I could not remember when I'd ever felt so down 
 At least when my folks split up, I'd had some friends around 
 But this mornin' I was all alone 
 All I had in life was this truck I owned 
 When I was rollin' down the road 
 Feelin' like nobody loved me 
 Bought myself a six pack 
 In some little Utah town 
 And I went lookin' for a place 
 Just to end it all six feet down 
 I found me a curve with a cliff outside 
 Turned around and headed for the one last ride 
 'Cause I was sick and tired o' livin' in a world 
 Where nobody loved me 
 But when I heard the music from a tent by the road 
 And I stopped just to listen awhile 
 They were singin' 'bout Jesus and freedom and love 
 Every face that I saw was a smile 
 Then a preacher stood up and what he had to say 
 I don't know how he knew, but he blew me away 
 He was tellin' my life in the smallest detail 
 Just like somebody somewhere, had been readin' my mail 
 I didn't know just what to do 
 I was feelin' so strange 
 Somethin' deep down inside me 
 Was startin' to change 
 When he said to step out 
 I came and I prayed 
 Suddenly I was no longer afraid 
 'Cause I knew in my heart and my soul, that Jesus, He loved me 
 Peace like a river was floodin' my soul 
 I gave Him the pieces, 
 He made it a whole 
 Now I'm livin' because I know 
 That somebody loves me 
 Now I'm livin' because I know 
 That somebody loves me, yeah 
 I'm livin' because I know 
 That Jesus, He loves me

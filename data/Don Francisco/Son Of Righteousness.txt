Let the Son of righteousness arise 
 With healing in His wings 
 Shine upon the people, Lord 
 Let Your Holy Spirit bring 
 The light that sets us free 
 To fix our eyes on things above 
 The glory of Your presence 
 The healing of Your love 
 Melt the clouds of darkness, now and 
 Set Your people free 
 Let the Son of righteousness 
 Rise and shine on me 
 Let the Son of righteousness arise 
 With healing in His wings 
 Shine upon the people, Lord 
 Let Your Holy Spirit bring 
 The light that sets us free 
 To fix our eyes on things above 
 The glory of Your presence 
 The healing of Your love 
 Melt the clouds of darkness, now and 
 Set Your people free 
 Let the Son of righteousness 
 Rise and shine on me 
 Shine in every corner 
 Soften every heart 
 Strengthen all your body 
 Glorify each part 
 Let the Son of righteousness arise 
 With healing in His wings 
 Shine upon the people, Lord 
 Let Your Holy Spirit bring 
 The light that sets us free 
 To fix our eyes on things above 
 The glory of Your presence 
 The healing of Your love 
 Melt the clouds of darkness, now and 
 Set Your people free 
 Let the Son of righteousness 
 Rise and shine on me 
 Banish condemnation 
 With Your love and grace 
 Let the joy of Jesus 
 Shine on every face 
 Let the Son of righteousness arise 
 With healing in His wings 
 Shine upon the people, Lord 
 Let Your Holy Spirit bring 
 The light that sets us free 
 To fix our eyes on things above 
 The glory of Your presence 
 The healing of your love 
 Melt the clouds of darkness, now and 
 Set Your people free 
 Let the Son of righteousness 
 Rise and shine on me 
 Let the Son of righteousness 
 Rise and shine on me!

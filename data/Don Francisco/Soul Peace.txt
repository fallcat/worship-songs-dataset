Soul peace 
 I'll give ya soul peace 
 Soul peace 
 I'll give ya soul peace 
 If you just come to Me 
 The troubled times that 
 This world is filled with 
 Can overflow 
 Lonely soul 
 All of the evil 
 And the suff'rin' 
 They take a heavy 
 Deadly toll 
 There's no tempest 
 That can touch you 
 Here in My tower 
 So strong and high 
 Here by My side there's 
 There's sweet joy and comfort 
 Yes, there is 
 'Til the storm 
 Has passed you by 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 In the shelter of My wings 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 In the rest My Spirit brings 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 In a place your heart can sing 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 Underneath My wings 
 Going your own way 
 All is frustration 
 With one small candle 
 You cannot see 
 The soul's in darkness 
 Without My Spirit 
 The limb is lifeless 
 Without the tree 
 But through My blood flows 
 The peace of Heaven 
 And in My grace 
 You're free indeed 
 Here in My love's light 
 You'll see forever 
 And safe in My arms 
 You'll find the rest you need 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 All your heart's been cryin for 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 There's no need to worry any more 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 If you'll just open up that door 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 That you've been longin' for 
 And when your feet have found the path 
 Where I have called you 
 And you learn to walk beside Me 
 In the way 
 You'll wake up in the mornin' 
 In My Presence (yes, you will) 
 And ease down in My peace 
 At end of day 
 You'll live in soul peace 
 Every night and every day 
 You'll live in soul peace 
 Doubt and fear just cannot stay 
 You'll live in soul peace 
 That no one here can steal away 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 Every night and day 
 Soul peace 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 Soul peace 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 I'll give you soul peace 
 If you just come to Me

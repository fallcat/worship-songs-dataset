Speak peace to my heart, Lord Jesus 
 This world has taken its toll 
 Its strife and confusion 
 Its doubt and its fear 
 Have troubled and wearied my soul 
 Speak peace to my heart, Lord Jesus 
 Let your Spirit take full control 
 Just like you spoke to the waves and the storm 
 Lord Jesus, speak peace to my soul 
 Speak peace to my heart, Lord Jesus 
 These worries and fears aren't from you 
 Help me remember my life's in your hands 
 And your promises all will come true 
 Speak peace to my heart, Lord Jesus 
 Let your Spirit take full control 
 Just like you spoke to the waves and the storm 
 Lord Jesus, speak peace to my soul 
 Speak peace to my heart, Lord Jesus 
 Let your Spirit take full control 
 Just like you spoke to the waves and the storm 
 Lord Jesus, speak peace to my soul 
 Just like you spoke to the waves and the storm 
 Lord Jesus, speak peace to my soul

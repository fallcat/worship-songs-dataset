Come on, get up on your feet 
 What's it gonna be: letter or spirit? 
 What's it gonna be: prison or free? 
 What's it gonna be: the heart of the Father, or the slavery of a second Sinai 
 And the black and white religion of the salesman of captivity 
 No, stand up for the truth of the gospel 
 Stand up, don't live in slavery again 
 Stand up in the freedom of Jesus 
 Don't give in for a moment 
 To the traditions of men 
 Nobody's ever got right with God 
 By keeping a religion of rules 
 If a Christian gets twisted into believing a religion like that 
 You know, the Bible even calls him a fool 
 Because it's only grace and faith in Jesus 
 That got us into the kingdom at all 
 And if someone says it's different now you're born again 
 Then they're heading for a nasty fall 
 So, stand up for the truth of the gospel 
 Stand up, don't wear those shackles again 
 Stand up, stand up in the freedom of Jesus 
 Don't give in for a moment 
 To the traditions of men 
 When you really get a hold of the gospel 
 It's almost too good to be true 
 Everything's bought and paid for 
 And your spirit's made righteous and new 
 Because God's judgement fell on Jesus 
 Now there's none of it left for you 
 Your life's been hidden with Christ in God 
 There's nothing left for you to do 
 Stand up for the truth of the gospel 
 Stand up, don't get entangled again 
 Stand up, stand up in the freedom of Jesus 
 Don't give in for a moment 
 To the traditions of men 
 Stand up for the truth of the gospel 
 Stand up, don't live in slavery again 
 Stand up! Stand up! 
 In the freedom of Jesus 
 Don't give in for a moment 
 To the traditions of men 
 No, don't give in for a moment 
 To the traditions of men

I don't care how many buses you own 
 Or the size of your sanctuary 
 Doesn't matter how steep 
 Your steeple is, if it's sittin' on a cemetery 
 I don't care if you pave your parking lot 
 Or put pads upon your pews 
 What good is a picture perfect stage 
 If you're missin' all the cues 
 I don't care if your pastor is super powered 
 And your program's always new 
 What you need is love and truth 
 And men are gonna come to you 
 It doesn't matter if you know the Bible 
 If it's all just in your head 
 But the thing I need to ask you 
 Is have you done the things I said? 
 Do you love your wife? 
 For her and for and for your children 
 Are you layin' down your life? 
 What about the others? 
 Are you livin' as a servant 
 To your sisters and your brothers? 
 Do you make the poor man beg you for a bone? 
 Do the widow and the orphan cry alone? 
 I don't care if you pray for miracles 
 I don't care if you speak with tongues 
 I don't care if you've said you love Me 
 In every song you've sung 
 It doesn't matter if your sacrifice of praise 
 Is loud enough to raise the dead 
 The thing I need to ask you 
 Is have you done the things I said? 
 Do you love your wife? 
 With all you've got inside you 
 Are you layin' down your life? 
 What about the others? 
 Are you livin' as a servant 
 To your sisters and your brothers? 
 Do you make the poor man beg you for a bone? 
 Do the widow and the orphan cry alone? 
 Lord, when were you a prisoner 
 But we did not come to you 
 When was it that we saw you sick 
 That we didn't follow through 
 Every time you turned your head 
 And pretended not to see 
 When you did it not to the least of these 
 You did it not to Me

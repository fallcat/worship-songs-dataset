If you gave me half a reason 
 I would tell you what is true 
 But no matter how you listen 
 There's nothin' I could do 
 To make you see with more than just your mind 
 Until the day you step across the line 
 No explanation could tell you what I've seen 
 There's no way to paint a picture 
 That could show you what I mean 
 When I say I left the man I was behind 
 And found another world across the line 
 You gotta take a step across the line 
 Let Jesus fill your heart and mind 
 I can show you where to look 
 But you've gotta seek to find 
 You gotta take a step across the line 
 An invitation is the best that I can do 
 To change your future 'til forever 
 And the rest is up to you 
 You can take his hand, or keep on goin' blind 
 He waits for you to step across the line 
 You gotta take a step across the line 
 Let Jesus fill your heart and mind 
 I can show you where to look 
 But you've gotta seek to find 
 You gotta take a step across the line 
 You gotta take a step across the line 
 Let Jesus fill your heart and mind 
 I can show you where to look 
 But you've gotta seek to find 
 You gotta take a step across the line 
 You gotta take a step across the line 
 Let Jesus fill your heart and mind 
 I can show you where to look 
 But you've gotta seek

In the lives of those that follow there is going to come a time 
 When rhythm starts to stumble and singsong swallows rhyme 
 When imaginations crumble, false foundations turn to dust 
 Towers fall to piles of stones and girders into rust 
 Till you let the blood of Jesus wash the rubble from your mind 
 And your eyes again can see the one you almost left behind 
 When theology's in tatters and reason is absurd 
 Still your soul in silence and listen for His word 
 So many turns, so many ways, so many voices cry 
 Standing at the crossroads watching time go flashing by 
 Indecision paralyzes, it's the fear of choosing wrong 
 But waiting is a step itself, and your wondering too long 
 So again you search the scripture, and again you ask your friends 
 But last of all the One who knows the beginning from the end 
 In the clamor and confusion and the blindness of your choice 
 Still your soul in silence, and listen for His voice 
 Rome is full of ruins, Babylon is gone 
 The temple's just a memory that some still dwell upon 
 But deep within a place that sword and veil had once denied 
 A tree of life is growing, living waters flow beside 
 Far beyond all human reason and words upon a page 
 His glory lightens all who fret their hour upon this stage 
 To know Him is our freedom, to hear Him is release 
 To fix your heart and soul on Him is rest and perfect peace

Eve had two children by Adam her husband 
 They grew into man as the years went on by 
 Cain was a farmer but Abel a shepherd 
 When the time for their offering to God had drawn nigh. 
 Now Abel he heeded the voice of the spirit 
 And his offering in faith was the life of a lamb 
 But Cain offered grain and his gift was rejected 
 For it came from the will and the pride of a man. 
 Cain, said the Lord, now why are you angry 
 When no one has hurt you or done you a wrong 
 If you change and do right you'll still be accepted 
 Sin wants to snare you and you must be strong 
 Sin wants to have you and you must be strong. 
 Spurning the chance to repent and find favor 
 Preferring his pride and refusing to yield 
 Cain gave his heart up to rage and to envy 
 Till he murdered his brother one day in the field. 
 Cain, said the Lord, now where is your brother 
 Did you think you could murder and never be found 
 You're cursed by the earth for this crime you've committed 
 For the voice of his blood is crying out from the ground. 
 So Cain wandered far from his home and his people 
 Eastward from Eden to the country of Nod, 
 Spend all his years as an exile and stranger 
 Away from the presence and the blessing of God. 
 So learn now a lesson from Cain and his folly, 
 Through pride hate and jealousy only comes wrong 
 Envy and anger will end in disaster 
 They are waiting to snare you so watch and be strong 
 Sin wants to have you so watch and be strong.

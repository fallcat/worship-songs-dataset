People wear a vested interest in covering up the lies 
 Will tell you it's the same since the world's foundation 
 Morning and noon and night 
 But the Lord is not slack in His promises 
 Each day is by His command 
 He's just giving everybody a chance for salvation 
 Before He lowers His hand 
 The day of the Lord is comin' like a thief in the deep of the night 
 To strike fear in the heart of darkness and joy in the children of light 
 As it was in the time of Noah so shall His coming be 
 No one's going to know the hour or the minute 
 But the signs are getting plainer to see 
 The gospel is preached to the nations 
 The victories leaves are green 
 Young men are prophesying 
 Old men are dreaming dreams 
 Sinew is knitted to sinew 
 Bones being fastened to bone 
 And every day nearer to the day of the Lord 
 Is like a thousand years closer to home 
 Jesus is coming in power to sit on a throne of light 
 Calling every nation before His face 
 Judging man left and right 
 And He'll give the keys of the Kingdom 
 To everyone worthy to stand 
 To those found walking in righteousness in the day of the Son of Man 
 And every day nearer to the day of the Lord 
 Is like a thousand years closer to home

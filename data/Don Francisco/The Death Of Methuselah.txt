I was born just east of Eden, many centuries ago 
 And with Adam down to Jared I have watched this river flow 
 The name my father gave me, soon its message will be done 
 Methuselah he called me: 'when he dies, then it shall come' 
 In the first three hundred years, I saw him almost every day 
 Though Enoch is my father, still it's true these words I say 
 That there never lived a man like him who walked with God above 
 So merciful and righteous, and so full of faith and love 
 An otherworldly wisdom was in all he'd do and say 
 And I'd feel God's holy power every time that he would pray 
 So often I would see him, sittin' quiet by the tree 
 But I could hear the heavenly voices 
 And the light was strange to see 
 I followed when he climbed upon the mountain top that day 
 For I knew somehow the time had come for him to go away 
 And I say the Lord descending 
 And the glory of His throne 
 When He took him from the earth 
 And left me kneeling there alone 
 I could see the darkness deepening now 
 My race is almost run 
 There's a rumbling in the distance 
 And at last your ark is done 
 And Noah, now you've come to me 
 It's time for me to die 
 Enoch's voice is calling me 
 And I must say 'goodbye' 
 My father's voice is calling me 
 It's time to say 'goodbye' 
 Goodbye

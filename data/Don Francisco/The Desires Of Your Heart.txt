At the hard-knock school of livin', seems you always get there late 
 Even if you pass the tests, you never graduate 
 There's a graveyard out in back that's filled with dreams that crashed and burned 
 With epitaphs to tragedy and lessons never learned 
 There is another way besides that school that never ends 
 But not too many find it - it's a narrow road, my friend 
 It's the way to trade your old heart in for one that never dies 
 Where fadin' hopes can live again and dreams can fin'lly fly 
 Delight yourself in the Lord 
 And He will give you the desires of your heart 
 Delight yourself in the Lord 
 And He will give you the desires of your heart 
 The heart you'll get from Jesus is spotless and brand new 
 With the good stuff that was buried by the old one shinin' through 
 Forgotten seeds'll flourish where those livin' waters flow 
 In the gentle hands of Jesus all your life will start to grow 
 It's not that I'm religious, or because I'm rich or smart 
 But God has more than satisfied the longings of my heart 
 And I am living proof this simple verse is really true 
 And what the Lord has done for me, He'd love to do for you.

Soft-soled slippers in silence 
 On tiptoes telling no tales 
 Footfalls that follow like moonlight 
 Quietly keep on your trail 
 Someone's been walking behind you 
 You turn, but there's nothing to see 
 Lingering sense of a presence 
 Wondering, what can it be? 
 Slowly, you start to remember 
 A comforting voice in the night 
 A song in the glory at sunrise 
 A call in the soft, evening light 
 Strange, and yet somehow familiar 
 The sound of your name on the wind 
 A sense that the searching is ended 
 And the change is about to begin 
 Warmth like a hand on your shoulder 
 A whisper that this term you hear 
 Glow like a lamp in the window 
 The Spirit of Jesus is here 
 The star of the morning is rising 
 The dayspring that scatters the dark 
 As heaven's awaiting your answer 
 Touches the door to your heart

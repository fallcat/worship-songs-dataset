Not to win 
 Not to fight 
 Not for profit 
 Or to prove that I'm right 
 Not for show 
 Nor facade 
 Sackcloth and ashes alone 
 Aren't accepted by God 
 But to give 
 And to unlock the doors 
 To take from my hand 
 And to place it in Yours 
 To break every yolk 
 And to cut loose the chains 
 To give clothes to the naked 
 And a roof from the rain 
 Not to steal 
 Or demand what is due 
 Not to lie 
 And pretend that it's true 
 Not to do 
 Nor to speak as I please 
 Not to harden my heart to the dying 
 And to live at my ease 
 But to give You my life 
 Without keeping a part 
 To return to my God 
 And repent with my heart 
 Throw open the door 
 To the one lock outside 
 And to worship the King 
 Without falseness or pride 
 And your light will arise 
 And break through like the sun 
 And your righteousness shine 
 When obedience is done 
 Guarded by God 
 And led forth by the Lamb 
 When you cry with your voice 
 He will say, here I am! 
 Not to win 
 Not to fight 
 Not for profit 
 Or to prove that I'm right 
 Not for show 
 Nor facade 
 Sackcloth and ashes alone 
 Aren't accepted by God

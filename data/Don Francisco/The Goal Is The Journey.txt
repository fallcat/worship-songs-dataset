Stay away from the highway 
 From the crowds on the road 
 From the engines of labour 
 From the strain of the load 
 Leave your burden behind you 
 With no cost or a toll 
 In the footsteps of freedom 
 Find rest for your soul 
 Look around at the crossroads 
 And then ask for the way 
 For the path of the ancients 
 That leads on to the day 
 Then turn aside to the footpath 
 To the way of the wise 
 Where the goal is the journey 
 Peace is the prize 
 And the years that were ravaged 
 And wasted in chains 
 I'll restore them completely 
 In a slow gentle rain 
 Because of My vindication 
 You'll forget all the shame 
 And when I turn round your fortunes 
 You'll worship My name 
 Stay away from the highway 
 From the crowds on the road 
 From the engines of labor 
 From the strain of the load 
 Turn aside to the footpath 
 To the way of the wise 
 Where the goal is the journey 
 Peace is the prize 
 The goal is the journey 
 Peace is the prize

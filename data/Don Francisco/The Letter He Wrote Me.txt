The letter he wrote me was seething with hatred and rage 
 It's a wonder the handwriting didn't set fire to the page 
 Threatening slander, then ending by calling me names 
 If the devil himself sent that letter, 
 It'd have been much the same 
 But I'm sorry to say that a minister put down those words 
 Reacting to hearing the Gospel that he'd never heard 
 I'm sure glad no religious police could be set on my trail 
 Or just like Saul of Tarsus, I know he's have thrown me in jail 
 It's amazing that people will fight for the right to wear chains 
 Dragging their guilt and their pride, their addictions and pain 
 The whole time believing that God's in those curses they pray 
 And charging like rhinos at those who would show them the way 
 I know Jesus warned us, but still I get caught by surprise 
 When someone who's using His name does it just for disguise 
 All you can do is commit them to God and to prayer 
 That one day they'll find their way out to the light and the air 
 All I can do is commit him to God and to prayer 
 That one day he'll find his way out to the light and the air.

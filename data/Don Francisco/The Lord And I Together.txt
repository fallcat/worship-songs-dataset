When I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor, 
 I set my heart in the right direction; 
 Let the world be driven by its worries and fears: 
 My faith is in the resurrection. 
 To the power of the spirit who lives in me, 
 Ya know the devil cannot hold a candle. 
 There ain’t nothing gonna happen today 
 The Lord and I together can’t handle. 
 You know I love to start the morning on the truth in his Word, 
 Because his promises beat anything that I’ve ever heard. 
 When I walk in his commandments and his promises too, 
 I know his blessings gonna follow me whatever I do. 
 When I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor, 
 I set my heart in the right direction; 
 Let the world be driven by its worries and fears: 
 My faith is in the resurrection. 
 To the power of the spirit who lives in me, 
 Ya know the devil cannot hold a candle. 
 There ain’t nothing gonna happen today 
 That the Lord and I together can’t handle 
 But you know sometimes later in the heat of the day, 
 I get a little anxious, start losin’ my way. 
 Then he gently reminds me deep down in my soul 
 He’s still the King and he’s still in control. 
 And later in the evenin’ at the settin’ of the sun, 
 I lift my heart and thank him for the things that he’s done; 
 I open my bible and just listen to him, 
 He takes my empty cup and fills it up to the brim. 
 So when I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor, 
 I got my heart in the right direction; 
 Let the world be driven by its worries and fears: 
 My faith is in the resurrection. 
 To the power of the spirit who lives in me, 
 Ya know the devil can’t hold a candle. 
 There ain’t nothing gonna happen today 
 That the Lord and I together can’t handle

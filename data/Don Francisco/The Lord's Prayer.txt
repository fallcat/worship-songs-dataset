Our Father 
 Who is in Heaven 
 Hallowed and worshipped 
 Be Your name 
 May Your kingdom come 
 And Your will be done 
 Here on this earth 
 As it is in heaven 
 Give us this day 
 Our daily bread 
 And forgive us all our debts 
 As we forgive our debtors 
 Lead us not into temptation 
 But deliver us from every evil 
 For the kingdom and the power 
 Are Yours forever 
 The kingdom and the power 
 Are Yours forever 
 The kingdom, the power, and the glory 
 Are Yours forever

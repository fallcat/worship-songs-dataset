I was wakened in the morning' by a knockin' on the door 
 So I got up and went to see what all the knockin' was for 
 There stood the Devil with a box addressed to me 
 He said "Boy, I've got something here I think you oughta see 
 I said, I know that I don't want it if it's anything from you 
 'Cause I hate everything you say and don't like anything you do 
 But then he pointed with his finger and he smiled kinda sly 
 'Cause the package said "from God" there in the corner, way up high 
 So I said, "if it's from God, then why'd He send it here by you" 
 He said, "He always sends me when there's dirty work to do" 
 And this box is full of misery, poverty and shame 
 To perfect you through your suffering till you're worthy of His name 
 Well, I'd been pretty patient, but that last line took the cake 
 I just couldn't take no more, I'd taken all that I could take 
 So I told him what I thought of him and all his filthy lies 
 Then I fired a shot that got him right between the eyes 
 I told him "Jesus took my sickness and my poverty away 
 You nailed Him to the cross yourself when you murdered Him that day 
 The suf'ring that I do will be for love and not for shame 
 I'm already worthy by His blood, to wear His name 
 And I know my Father loves me and has only good in store 
 So you just take that jive and get away from my front door 
 You can write my name on packages until I'm ninety two 
 But every single one I'm sending back to Hell with you" 
 Go on get out of here

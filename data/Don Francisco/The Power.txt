It was a crowd of mixed emotions 
 That walked back to the room 
 Steadfastly we set all our minds to prayer 
 Waiting together with his relatives and friends 
 Well above a hundred of us there 
 Some of us he'd healed; some he'd raised up from the dead 
 Some he'd called as he went walking past 
 We recounted all the stories, with no detail left unturned 
 Determined with a will to make it last 
 Outside in the street, the feast's cacophany began 
 As crowds from all around the world convened 
 Flowing upwards to the temple, with their firstfruits in their hands 
 Unaware of all that we had seen 
 Dawn turned into daylight, just like all the days before 
 And again we lifted hands to God in prayer 
 And though no-one had imagined what the morning held in store 
 Still all of us felt something in the air 
 Then faint at first, we heard a sound that slowly grew to more 
 Like a tempest far away upon the sea 
 Building higher 'til it filled the house with a thunder and a roar 
 Like an army's final shout of victory 
 And right there in the midst of us 
 From nothing burst a flame 
 And tongues of fire rose high into the air 
 Then separating, settled down on each of us the same 
 And at once the sounds of praise were everywhere 
 And the flood of joy inside me then was more than I could bear 
 Like peace and laughter joined into a whole 
 'Cause the power that came from Jesus that we'd felt for all these years 
 Was flowing deep and wide within my soul 
 Praise you, Jesus, for your Holy Spirit 
 Praise you, Jesus, reigning on the throne 
 Praise you, Jesus, for the power you've given 
 Praise and glory unto you alone 
 Praise you, Jesus, for your Holy Spirit 
 Praise you, Jesus, reigning on the throne 
 Praise you, Jesus, for the power you've given 
 Praise and glory unto you alone 
 Praise you, Jesus, for your Holy Spirit 
 Praise you, Jesus, reigning on the throne 
 Praise you, Jesus, for the power you've given 
 Praise and glory unto you alone

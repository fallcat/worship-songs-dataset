Here I am: just a poor man 
 Made poorer still by the knowledge of the riches I have squandered 
 Oh, I've wandered; I stand convicted 
 Even knowing that the deepest of my wounds were mostly self-inflicted 
 Where did my heart go? 
 Where have I been? 
 You opened my eyes to the darkness and lies 
 And I shut them again 
 And I wanna go home to my Father 
 I wanna be part of where my heart says I belong 
 I wanna wash my weary soul in living water 
 I've been away way too long; I wanna go home 
 Out on the bound'ries of my freedom 
 I was lookin' for fences that would keep me in, and I found there were none 
 Only your sweet love, Lord 
 Fool that I've been 
 You broke the chains to my heartache and pain 
 And I forged them again 
 And I wanna go home to my Father 
 I wanna be part of where my heart says I belong 
 I wanna wash my weary soul in living water 
 I've been away way too long; I wanna go home 
 Oh, Jesus, Lord, please help me, I'm so full of regret 
 So hard to forgive myself; it's harder to forget 
 I need you to hold me and heal me 
 To mold me and steel me 
 By the power of your Word to be the son 
 You've called me to be 
 I wanna go home to my Father 
 I wanna be part of where my heart says I belong 
 I wanna wash my weary soul in living water 
 I've been away way too long; I wanna go home 
 I've been away way too long; I wanna go home

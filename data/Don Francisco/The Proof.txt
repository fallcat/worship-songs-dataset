The offering's down, the crowds have gone 
 Hustled by hucksters, ripped off by the cons 
 It's one more show, so flip the dial 
 Give up on the real and settle for style 
 Just open your ears to the people you meet 
 Even the name is a joke on the street 
 A cynic's laugh, they turn away 
 Why should they believe 
 What you're trying to say? 
 We don't need another talkin' head 
 We don't need another pro 
 So what if we do it as well as the world 
 If they just see another show? 
 We light the candle, we ring the bell 
 Playing the roles that we've learned so well 
 Hungry, but blind to why and how 
 Still we keep feeding that sacred cow 
 We don't need another driven man 
 We don't need a clanging gong 
 So what if we do it as well as the world 
 When they've done it that way all along? 
 Where is the life that is real to the touch 
 When somebody needs a hand? 
 Maybe after you've stopped the bleeding 
 You can show them the promised land 
 Just like the unbelieving brothers of Jesus 
 Those voices are whisperin' to you 
 "If you're really filled with the Spirit 
 Go show the world what you can do!" 
 The public prayers, the TV show 
 They're all well and good, as far as they go 
 But those outside will hide their pain 
 'Til you show them your love 
 When there's nothing to gain 
 We don't need a star of the stage or the screen 
 We don't need another pro 
 So what if we do it as well as the world 
 If they just see another show? 
 Where is the heart of compassion 
 That answers the cry of despair? 
 In the hand that is moved by the Spirit 
 Is the proof of the God who is there 
 In the hand that is moved by the Spirit 
 Is the proof of the God who is there.

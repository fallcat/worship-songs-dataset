The sound of your voice 
 When you're calling my name 
 Is the voice of a friend 
 Without anger or blame 
 The sound of your voice 
 Is a sound full of love 
 From the heart of a father 
 On the wings of a dove 
 The sound of your voice 
 Is a fire in the cold 
 Awakens my spirit 
 Gives peace to my soul 
 The sound of your voice 
 Speaks faith to my fears 
 Brings grace and forgiveness 
 Takes the pain from my tears 
 The sound of your voice 
 Is a fire in the cold 
 Awakens my spirit 
 Gives peace to my soul 
 The sound of your voice 
 Is a fire in the cold 
 Awakens my spirit 
 Gives peace to my soul 
 The sound of your voice 
 When you're calling my name 
 Is the voice of a friend 
 Without anger or blame 
 The sound of your voice 
 Is a sound full of love 
 From the heart of a father 
 On the wings of a dove 
 From the heart of a father 
 On the wings of a dove

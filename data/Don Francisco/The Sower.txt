O the sower sows the word 
 But who is the one who is heard 
 And from faith to deed 
 Brings a crop from the seed 
 When the sower sows the word? 
 Like seed scattered wide on a sidewalk 
 With no place for the roots to dig in 
 That's the gospel to those who've been hardened 
 By the world and its doubt and its sin 
 To the sound of the truth of the kingdom 
 They are deaf and just don't understand 
 And the enemy comes and he steals away 
 The abundance the Father had planned 
 O the sower sows the word 
 But who is the one who is heard 
 And from faith to deed 
 Brings a crop from the seed 
 When the sower sows the word? 
 Like seed in thin soil over bedrock 
 With no depth for the roots to go down 
 The shoots appear green in the morning 
 But they're scorched when the sun heats the ground 
 So some hear the gospel with gladness 
 When trouble and testing arise 
 In the heat of the battle they wither 
 And retreat to a refuge of lies 
 O the sower sows the word 
 But who is the one who is heard 
 And from faith to deed 
 Brings a crop from the seed 
 When the sower sows the word? 
 When the seed falls in weeds, thorns and thistles 
 Struggles for water and light 
 Weeds grow up faster and larger 
 And the harvest gets lost in the fight 
 That's the word in a heart that's distracted 
 By the world and its worries and prides 
 By money and thrills of the senses 
 While the real life just shrivels and dies 
 But the one who brings sowing to reaping 
 In this one, the Father delights 
 When the word's understood and accepted 
 Watered and kept in the light 
 When the plough has dug deep down the furroughs 
 And the stones have been thrown from the field 
 Producing some thirty, some sixty, sometimes a hundredfold yield 
 For the sower sows the word 
 Who is the one who is heard 
 And from faith to deed 
 Brings a crop from the seed 
 When the sower sows the word 
 When the sower sows the word 
 When the sower sows the word 
 When the sower sows the word?

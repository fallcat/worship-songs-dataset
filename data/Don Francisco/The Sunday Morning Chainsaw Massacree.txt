They were goin' to church: all the regulars and a few more 
 Nobody had a clue what was comin' when they walked through the door 
 They were sayin' hello, they were takin' their seats 
 And everyone was ready for the basic repeat 
 Some songs then an offering and a sermon like the Sundays before 
 Nobody noticed what was sittin' underneath the front pew 
 No-one had imagined what the pastor was intendin' to do 
 When he got to his feet, they were settlin' in 
 Waitin' for the preacher man to begin 
 But that expectation was never again to come true 
 'Cause the sanctuary suddenly filled with a deafening roar 
 When the chainsaw started that the pastor picked up from the floor 
 He laid into the pulpit and he cut it right through 
 Only pieces were left after a second or two 
 And when he turned the thing off, you know he had their attention for sure 
 It was the Sunday Morning Chainsaw Massacree 
 Nobody died except religious co-dependency 
 The heavens were opened when that pulpit went down 
 And God's Holy Spirit started movin' around 
 And those half-baked pew potatoes got really set free 
 At the Sunday Morning Chainsaw Massacree 
 And the minister asked, "Do you all understand what I did? 
 Everyone's a minister here; you know you're not little kids 
 The Holy One's in each one of you, and it's time I let you see that it's true 
 My name isn't 'pastor'; from now on, call me 'Uncle Sid' 
 Don't you dare call me pastor; my first name's really just 'Sid'." 
 It was the Sunday Morning Chainsaw Massacree 
 Nobody died except some habits and formality 
 The heavens were opened when that pulpit went down 
 And God's Holy Spirit started movin' around 
 And that pastor and the congregation got really set free 
 At the Sunday Morning Chainsaw Massacree 
 Now the reason I know is 'cause I happened to visit that place 
 By then, the pews were gone and we worshipped and danced in the space 
 Some had a teaching; some had revelation; some had a psalm; some interpretation 
 Jesus was Lord, and he was shining on every face 
 By the time we were done, I'd been filled by his power and grace 
 It was the Sunday Morning Chainsaw Massacree 
 Nobody died except religious co-dependency 
 The heavens were opened when that pulpit went down 
 And God's Holy Spirit started movin' around 
 And the pastor and the congregation got really set free 
 At the Sunday Morning Chainsaw Massacree

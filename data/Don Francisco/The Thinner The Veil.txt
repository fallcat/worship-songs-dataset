Come September, the streams have receded 
 The colors of spring fade away 
 But the light shining out from the spirit 
 Grows brighter with each passing day 
 For the temple that one day will crumble 
 It carries a fire that won't fail 
 And the flame I set burning forever 
 Shines brighter the thinner the veil 
 Because you have known Me and loved Me 
 I'll honor you all of your days 
 The angels are charged with your guarding 
 To keep you in all of your ways 
 Come September, the streams have receded 
 The colors of spring fin'lly fail 
 But the flame I set burning forever 
 Shines brighter the thinner the veil 
 The flame I set burning forever 
 Shines brighter the thinner the veil.

The day dawned in confusion 
 Like a nightmare with no end 
 Tired and dreary colors 
 Ragged hopes that wouldn't mend 
 The grief and fear of death 
 Just seemed to hang across the sky 
 And the pain just kept on burnin' 
 Though the tears had all been cried 
 We were talkin' as we journeyed 
 Toward a quiet country town 
 When another traveler asked us 
 Why we seemed so sad and down 
 It was like a dam had burst inside 
 As I spoke my grief and woe 
 Amazed that someone leavin' there 
 Could somehow still not know 
 But the traveler called us foolish men 
 And gall and slow of heart 
 And he showed us from the Scriptures 
 God had planned it from the start 
 But it wasn't till the evening 
 That our eyes were opened there 
 And we knew that it was Jesus 
 But He vanished in the air 
 We rushed back to Jerusalem 
 To tell the others there 
 They said "we have seen Him too" 
 There was excitement everywhere 
 Nearly shouting to each other 
 As the realization grew 
 When all at once He spoke to us 
 "Peace be unto you" 
 We started back in terror 
 For His radiance filled the place 
 The light was all around Him 
 And was shining from His face 
 But then He smiled a smile of love 
 That left no cause for doubt 
 And then because He knew our hearts 
 He spoke our feelings out 
 "Why are you so troubled? 
 Why are you in fear? 
 See My hands and see My feet 
 I Myself am here 
 Reach out now and handle Me 
 Until you've all been shown 
 My life is more than spirit 
 For I'm here in flesh and bone" 
 Some lifted hands toward heaven 
 And then knelt without a sound 
 Some just stood and stared at Him 
 As if rooted to the ground 
 But I could not contain the joy 
 That flooded heart and soul 
 It came rushing out in praises 
 I had no wish to control! 
 Joy, joy, joy, joy 
 Joy, joy, joy, joy 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 We have been redeemed 
 Joy, joy, joy, joy! 
 Joy, joy, 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 We have been redeemed 
 Joy, joy, joy, joy! 
 Joy, joy, joy, joy! 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all! 
 We have been redeemed! 
 Joy, joy, joy---

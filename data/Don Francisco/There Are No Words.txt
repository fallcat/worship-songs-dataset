There are no words to tell You how I love You 
 There are no words to even make a start 
 There are no words worthy of your sacrifice 
 There are no words, so Lord, I give my heart 
 There are no words to tell You how I love You 
 There are no words to even make a start 
 There are no words worthy of your love for me 
 There are no words, so Lord, I give my heart 
 There are no words, so Lord, I give my heart

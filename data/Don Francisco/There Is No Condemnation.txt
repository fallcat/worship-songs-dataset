Sittin' by my window 
 On a rainy afternoon 
 Everything inside my head 
 Was playin' outta tune 
 I was thinkin' of the fool I'd made 
 Of me the night before 
 In front of God and everyone 
 I'd sinned and sinned some more 
 Well, I thought of all the things I'd done 
 I winced at things I'd said 
 I wallowed in self pity 
 I hung my worried head 
 Right when I was so far down 
 That even up looked wrong 
 That's when Jesus gave to me 
 The chorus of this song 
 He said, Satan, the accuser 
 Has been whisperin' in your ear 
 You just tell him you're forgiven 
 He's got no business here 
 Cause it doesn't matter what you've done 
 It matters what you'll be 
 There is no condemnation 
 When the Son has set you free 
 Now I could say that right away 
 The sun bursts through the clouds 
 And I just started singin' on 
 That chorus right out loud 
 But actually I moped around 
 And blew another day 
 Before I let myself accept the words 
 I'd heard Him say 
 He said, Satan, the accuser 
 Has been whisperin' in your ear 
 You just tell him you're forgiven 
 He's got no business here 
 Cause it doesn't matter what you've done 
 It matters what you'll be 
 There is no condemnation 
 When the Son has set you free 
 So I can't critisize you now 
 If you wanna take your time 
 Cling to all your problems 
 Just the way I'd clung to mine 
 But now you got the answer 
 Jesus wanted you to know 
 He'll take your sin and guilt away 
 If you'll just let them go 
 And if Satan the accuser 
 Has been whisperin' in your ear 
 You just tell him you're forgiven 
 He's got no business here 
 Cause it doesn't matter what you've done 
 It matters what you'll be 
 There is no condemnation 
 When the Son has set you free 
 There is no condemnation 
 When the Son has set you free

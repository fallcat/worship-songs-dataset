There's more that stand on our side 
 No matter what you see 
 A king who hated Israel 
 Was tryin' to win a war 
 But every move he made 
 It seemed that Israel knew before 
 "No, it's not a spy inside our camp," 
 His men explained one day 
 "There's a prophet named Elisha 
 Hears every word you say." 
 They found out where Elisha lived 
 And the army marched that night 
 They surrounded all the city 
 By the morning's early light 
 When Elisha's servant rose 
 He saw that army all around 
 And he said, "What are we gonna do? 
 They're gonna cut us down." 
 But Elisha told his servant 
 "Now, don't give in to your fear 
 Those that are with us 
 Are more than all this army here." 
 And Elisha prayed that his servant's eyes 
 Would have the sight required 
 And he saw God's mighty army 
 With its chariots of fire 
 There's more that stand on our side 
 No matter what you see 
 Doesn't matter how it seems 
 How strong the enemy 
 Don't believe your eyes 
 Believe your Father's guarantee 
 They're more that stand on our side 
 No matter what you see 
 The enemy moved towards the town 
 And Elisha prayed a prayer 
 "Lord, strike 'em all with blindness 
 Let confusion be a snare." 
 God struck that whole army blind 
 And he brought them to defeat 
 The victory that he gave that day 
 Was total and complete 
 There's more that stand on our side 
 No matter what you see 
 It doesn't matter how it seems 
 How strong the enemy 
 Don't believe your eyes 
 Believe your Father's guarantee 
 They're more that stand on our side 
 No matter what you see 
 The eyes of God search all the earth 
 To find each blameless heart 
 To show his power and faithfulness 
 To take his children's part 
 And though fear is all around you 
 Don't you dare give in 
 Because the battle is the Lord's 
 And he's the one who's gonna win 
 There's more that stand on our side 
 No matter what you see 
 It doesn't matter how it seems 
 How strong the enemy 
 Don't believe your eyes 
 Believe your Father's guarantee 
 They're more that stand on our side 
 No matter what you see

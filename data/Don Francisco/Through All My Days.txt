I'll worship through all my days 
 I'll raise my hands; I'll sing your praise 
 I'll bless your name and lift it high 
 With heart and soul and voice I cry 
 Jesus, I worship you 
 Jesus, I worship you 
 Jesus, I worship you 
 My God and my King 
 I'll worship through all my days 
 I'll raise my hands; I'll sing your praise 
 I'll bless your name and lift it high 
 With heart and soul and voice I cry 
 Jesus, I worship you 
 Jesus, I worship you 
 Jesus, I worship you 
 My God and my King 
 I'll worship through all my days (through all my days) 
 I'll raise my hands; I'll sing your praise (I'll sing your praise)

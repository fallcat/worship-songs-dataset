Now as the world is unwinding 
 And the time of my coming draws near 
 Let this be a gentle reminding 
 For those who can listen and hear 
 My life is new life neverending 
 But the old and the new cannot blend 
 I will not prop up a religion 
 But sinners are always my friends 
 And I've always got time for my friends 
 Yes, I've always got time for my friends 
 And you know that it's true by my Spirit in you 
 I've always got time for my friends 
 Yes, I've always got time for my friends 
 Today, there's religion abounding 
 Old casks of water-down wine 
 The wolves wear such dapper disguises 
 Only I know the hearts that are mine 
 But I still heal the sick and the broken 
 And I stand with those no-one defends 
 I still want no part of religioun 
 But sinners are always my friends 
 And I've always got time for my friends 
 Yes, I've always got time for my friends 
 And you know that it's true by my Spirit in you 
 I've always got time for my friends 
 Do you think we're made blind by tradition? 
 The problem is you think you can see 
 We know the Bible in eleven renditions 
 But why don't you just come to me? 
 I've always got time for my friends 
 I've always got time for my friends 
 And you know that it's true by my Spirit in you 
 I've always got time for my friends 
 Yes, I've always got time for my friends 
 Yes, I've always got time for my friends 
 You know that it's true by my Spirit in you 
 I've always got time for my friends 
 Yes, I've always got time for my friends 
 Yes, I've always got time for my friends

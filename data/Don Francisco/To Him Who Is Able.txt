Of Him who is able to keep you from falling 
 And present you unstained at His glorious throne 
 To Jesus our Savior 
 Be glory and majesty, power and honor 
 To Jesus alone. 
 He's mercy and truth and His love everlasting 
 Tomorrow and yesterday, ever the same 
 Throughout all the ages, today and forever 
 Let earth and the heavens sing praise to the name. 
 Repeat all above three and a half times.

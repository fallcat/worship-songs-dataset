I awoke to hear the jailer 
 Turn the key and push the door 
 Get out here, he shouted 
 But I stayed there on the floor 
 Frozen in the terror 
 That rose and filled my brain 
 For I knew what they intended 
 I could not face the pain 
 Then soldiers came into the cell 
 And they dragged me to the yard 
 They threw me down before a cross 
 And brought the whip down hard 
 Carry it, they shouted 
 As I struggled to my feet 
 I put my shoulder under it 
 And dragged it to the street 
 I stumbled through a wall of screams 
 As they drove me through the gate 
 I could see the thousands lined the street 
 Their voices filled with hate 
 Like a wolf pack in the night 
 That moves in for the kill 
 They closed the gap in front of us 
 As we started up the hill 
 And it seemed I'd barely reached the top 
 As they grabbed me from behind 
 They threw the cross under me 
 And tied the ropes that bind 
 The arms close to the beams 
 As they nailed the feet and hands 
 And they raised the cross up in the air 
 And dropped it in it's stand 
 Through a blur of pain 
 I saw the cross there next to mine 
 There were people all around it 
 So I looked to read the sign 
 It was nailed there up above His head 
 So the world could see the news 
 The man who seemed so helpless there 
 Was the King of all the Jews 
 And the crowd that stood around his cross 
 Made jokes about his name 
 They shouted, laughed, and spat on him 
 So I joined in the game 
 I said, Hey! If you're the King 
 Why don't You get us down from here 
 But the taunt just sounded hollow 
 It echoed in my ears 
 As He looked at me with eyes 
 That seemed to reach into my heart 
 They shone a light on all my lies 
 And tore my life apart 
 There was more that lay behind that gaze 
 Then simply mud and clay 
 But knowing was too much for me 
 I had to look away 
 But I chanced another look at Him 
 While He was lookin' down 
 Where the soldiers who just crucified us 
 Drank there on the ground 
 And although He spoke there quietly 
 Somehow his words came through 
 He said, Father, please forgive them 
 They don't know what they do 
 And then as if they heard Him speakin' 
 The crowd began to roar 
 With the frenzy by the priests 
 Who herds them on to more 
 But the worse the accusations 
 The plainer I could see 
 The guilt of the accusers 
 Not the One there next to me 
 But the one on the other cross 
 Began to curse and swear 
 And his voice was filled with venom 
 As he hurled it through the air 
 All the horror that was in him 
 It laid his life to waste 
 Came out of every syllable 
 He flung in Jesus' face 
 Jesus only looked at him 
 But somethin' rolls inside o' me 
 In spite of all that watched us there 
 It couldn't be denied 
 Because his righteousness and innocence 
 Were shining bright and strong 
 I just couldn't keep my silence 
 As that cursing still went on 
 I said, don't you fear the wrath of God? 
 Even at the end? 
 You'll curse us both into the pit 
 Is that what you intend? 
 We're only getting what we're due 
 Send our whole lives long 
 But don't you talk to Him that way 
 Cause He's done nothin' wrong 
 Then with all my courage 
 In a voice not my own 
 I asked him, Lord remember me 
 When You come into your throne 
 He answered me and even then 
 His love was undisguised 
 He said, before the sun will set today 
 You'll be with Me in paradise 
 The shouts and curses did not stop 
 Even when the sunlight ceased 
 But somehow in the midst of it 
 My soul had been released 
 Though the agony continued 
 It's still too small a price 
 To be allowed to hear those words 
 To die beside the Christ 
 Then darkness changed to dawning 
 And I heard the sound of voices 
 The air was warm around me 
 I stood beside a stream 
 And Abraham was speaking 
 To the multitudes before him 
 The unfolding of the Answer 
 To our prayers and hopes and dreams 
 Then far across the chasm 
 Came a rumbling like the thunder 
 And the Prince Of Peace came shining 
 From His mouth the power screamed 
 And the walls and towers crumbled 
 And the gates of hell went under 
 A thousand sang the victory 
 We have been redeemed 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 We have been redeemed 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 We have been redeemed 
 Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 We have been redeemed

We've been bakin' these bricks in the blazin' sun 
 Gonna build a mighty tower when we're fin'lly done 
 Yes, we're buildin' us a city, man, you know that's the goal 
 We're gonna be the people, gonna take control 
 All of the power and the money, too 
 Will be right in our hands when this work is all through 
 We say who's gonna sell, who's gonna buy 
 Who's gonna live, who's gonna die 
 Organization - that's the plan in this game 
 Centralization - gonna make us a name 
 We're really takin' over, so don't ya get in our way 
 Soon the whole world will have to do what we say 
 Whatever we decide, that's just what we're gonna do 
 There ain't nothin' gonna stop it - not me and not you 
 We know how to deal with those who stand in our way 
 So let me warn you, buddy - better watch what you say

There is strength for your weakness 
 Freedom for your chains 
 Healin' for your bruises 
 Peace for your pain 
 There's reward for your labor 
 Release when you're bound 
 Give it all to Jesus, let Him 
 Turn it around 
 Heart like a stone, all your fears locked deep inside 
 So all alone, never show the tears you've cried 
 You can't admit your weakness in a world so full of pride 
 But the emptiness you feel can't be denied 
 There is strength for your weakness 
 Freedom for your chains 
 Healin' for your bruises 
 Peace for your pain 
 There's reward for your labor 
 Release when you're bound 
 Give it all to Jesus, let Him 
 Turn it around 
 Why do you stay when it only brings you down 
 There is a way if you'll only turn around 
 You can trade all of your failures for a love that never ends 
 You can give up all your heartaches for a friend (He's got)

The vision came unbidden, at an unexpected pass 
 Where the winds of change blew colder 
 Whippin' snow that cut like glass 
 But like an old man in regret 
 For foolish sins and wasted youth 
 The scene that lay before me 
 Had no beauty save its truth 
 For the wind came down the mountains 
 Never slowing, never still 
 And the sheep were scattered shepherdless, 
 Alone across the hills 
 They were prey to every beast that roamed, 
 And entrapped by every curse 
 And they stumbled in their sickness, 
 In their weakness and their thirst 
 Below them in the valley, 
 The polluted waters flowed 
 Where the shepherds that were hirelings 
 Sat and argued what was owed 
 And the ambitious and abusive bragged 
 And they boasted on their might 
 And their profits from the slaughter 
 Of the ones who could not fight 
 And the wind just kept on howling, 
 As I cried, "Oh Lord, how long 
 Will your people be the victims 
 Of the ruthless, proud and strong?" 
 And at once there came an answer 
 In the quiet of my soul 
 "The time has come for judgement 
 And to make the wounded whole" 
 "For my heart is still a shepherd's heart 
 I know each one by name 
 The ragged and the beautiful, 
 The healthy and the lame 
 And I myself will lead them out, 
 And I'll feed them on the best 
 In pastures by still waters 
 In a place of peace and rest 
 O, but woe unto the shepherds 
 Who abuse my sheep and kill 
 With harshness and severity 
 You've bent them to your will 
 And today I am against you 
 As I take them from your hand- 
 When the fire of judgement comes 
 The stubble will not stand!" 
 Then darkness filled the valley 
 And I saw it take up form 
 Screaming winds and fire and lightning 
 More than any earthly storm 
 Where it passed were no survivors 
 For the land was cleansed and bare 
 But the streams flowed clear and purified 
 And the grass grew green and fair 
 I saw a man come walking 
 And his heart glowed like a flame 
 All the sheep began to run to him, 
 And he called each one by name 
 He spoke to them in gentle words 
 And he soothed their fearful minds 
 And he healed the brokenhearted 
 And the crippled, sick and blind 
 Then many others like him, 
 All with hearts that glowed the same 
 That before I hadn't noticed, 
 From the farms and fields they came 
 They weren't famous wise or noble 
 But they spoke a common word 
 A word the flock could recognize 
 And follow when they heard 
 They led them in green pastures, 
 By still waters in the light 
 Standing guard against the wolves 
 And other creatures of the night 
 Going out into the mountains 
 In the darkness and the cold 
 Bringing back the lost and wounded 
 To the safety of the fold 
 And the news went out around the world 
 In every street and town 
 That something wonderful was here, 
 That heaven had come down 
 And millions gave their hearts in trust 
 That long had been betrayed 
 And the bride at last was ready, 
 And the trumpet call was made 
 And the news went out around the world 
 In every street and town 
 That something wonderful was here, 
 That heaven had come down 
 And millions gave their hearts in trust 
 That long had been betrayed 
 And the bride at last was ready, 
 And the trumpet call was made

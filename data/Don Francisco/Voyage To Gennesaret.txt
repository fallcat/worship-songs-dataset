Eleven men besides myself in a boat both small and light 
 Pushed off for Gennesaret in the first watch of the night 
 But a storm came up at midnight blowing hard down on the prow 
 We started losing headway shipping water stern and bow 
 When someone shouted loud, "Hey, look to starboard on the sea!" 
 The men screamed out in terror at the form we all could see 
 Someone was walking on the water, and we trembled, cried and prayed 
 But He stopped and turned and He spoke to us, "It is I, don't be afraid." 
 I shouted out to Jesus, "If it's You, then call to me 
 And tell me now to come to You and walk across the sea." 
 And without a second's thought He looked at me and answered, "Come!" 
 My insides turned to water my mind went blank and numb 
 I climbed across the gunnel looking straight into His eyes 
 But long before I reached His side, the wind began to rise 
 But I forgot Him in an instant and I sank just like a stone 
 I cried out, "Jesus save me!" and His hand was on my own 
 "Oh man of little faith," He said, "what made you doubt My word 
 Have you been this long with Me without knowing what you've heard?" 
 We climbed into the boat and all at once the wind was gone 
 The sea turned calm and gentle the day began to dawn 
 We knelt amazed and worshiped Him for the power He displayed 
 For all that we had seen had left us wondering and dismayed 
 It was not till after Pentecost I began to understand 
 But even when I doubted Him, He did not let go my hand

She's one of the walking wounded 
 But the bleeding doesn't show 
 Behind the wall around her heart 
 Where none's allowed to go 
 It's been this way for so long now 
 She can't remember when 
 She could still hope for tomorrow 
 So instead, she just pretends 
 When she thinks no one can see her 
 Sometimes she'll crack the door 
 Until she feels the fear again 
 And locks it like before 
 Alone behind the windows 
 Curtained with her pride 
 She'll once again, embrace her pain 
 And turn away inside 
 To give away her heart before 
 Had been her first mistake 
 She knows she shouldn't doubt Him now 
 But there's just too much at stake 
 And still He keeps on calling 
 But she pretends she doesn't hear 
 He longs to touch and heal her 
 But she never lets Him near 
 She's one of the walking wounded 
 She's been searching for so long 
 Deep inside, she's hoping 
 All the fear she feels is wrong 
 Maybe He can give her 
 All the love she's been denied 
 Maybe it will be alright 
 If she lets Him come inside 
 To give away her heart before 
 Had been her first mistake 
 She knows she shouldn't doubt Him now 
 But there's just too much at stake 
 And still He keeps on calling 
 But she pretends she doesn't hear 
 He longs to touch and heal her 
 But she never lets Him near 
 She's one of the walking wounded 
 She's been searching for so long 
 Deep inside, she's hoping 
 All the fears she feels are wrong 
 Maybe He can give her 
 All the love she's been denied 
 Maybe it will be alright 
 If she lets Him come inside 
 To give away her heart before 
 Had been her first mistake 
 She knows she shouldn't doubt Him now 
 But there's just too much at stake 
 And still He keeps on calling 
 But she pretends she doesn't hear 
 He longs to touch and heal her 
 But she never lets Him near 
 She's one of the walking wounded 
 She's been searching for so long 
 Deep inside, she's hoping 
 All the fears she feels are wrong 
 Maybe He can give her 
 All the love she's been denied 
 Maybe it will be alright 
 If she lets Him come inside 
 And she thinks it might just be alright 
 If she lets Him come inside

Now the serpent was craftier than any of the animals the Lord had made. 
 He began to ask questions of Eve in the cool of the afternoon shade. 
 And she said, "God has told us not to eat of the tree in the midst of the garden, 
 For if we eat it or touch it, we'll forfeit our lives in the bargain." 
 "Oh but this is a lie, you will not surely die," Satan told her. 
 "He's saying these things just to give you a chance to be bolder. 
 If you will eat, you'll be just like God in your knowledge and glory, 
 Your eyes will be opened and this is the reason He's told you this story." 
 Now her husband was with her, and he listened to all that was spoken 
 He knew it was wrong and that the truth had somehow been broken. 
 But as she reached out her hand, and then ate, still believing the liar, 
 He ate of it too, and death rushed through their hearts like a fire. 
 "Oh, what have you done?," comes the voice of the Lord as He calls them, 
 "Oh, what have you done?," is the cry of the heart of their Father. 
 "Oh, what have you done?," as each passes the blame to the other, 
 And the curse like a stain slowly spreads and covers the ground. 
 "Ah, but you, said the Lord," as He speaks to the liar incarnate; 
 "From this day, I promise destruction to you by their hand. 
 Strike as you will with the venom of death and temptation, 
 There'll come a day when your head will be crushed by a man."

 "Oh, what have you done?," as each passes the blame to the other, 
 And the curse like a stain slowly spreads and covers the ground. 
 And to you, said the Lord, as He speaks to the liar incarnate 
 From this day, I promise destruction to you by their hand. 
 Strike as you will with the venom of death and temptation, 
 There'll come a day when your head will be crushed by a man. 
 There'll come a day when your head will be crushed by a man. 
 There'll come a day when your head will be crushed by a man.

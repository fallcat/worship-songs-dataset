What if the truth is much larger than what you've been told? 
 What if those facts are all counterfeit bills you've been sold? 
 When the interests you've vested and banked on turn out to be wrong 
 Can you let it all go, like the paper it's been all along? 
 What if the things you've believed are constructions of men? 
 What if the wood, hay and stubble collapses again? 
 When the flood water rises, don't rage at the wind and the rain 
 If the Lord built the house, it will stand up no matter the strain 
 What if through centuries of errors the meaning's been lost? 
 What if behind 'free indeed' someone's tacked on a cost? 
 Whenever people who worship a book use its words to control 
 It should be easy to see they were never the friends of your soul 
 In the power of his resurrection, we all be free 
 Free of religion and all it would shame us to be 
 There's no barrier left when you're seated above everything 
 No-one to bow down to when your brother is the king of all kings 
 The kingdom of God isn't high up some stair you must climb 
 But the treasure you've searched for has been in your heart all this time 
 When you hear the small voice deep inside, and you answer his call 
 You may leave quite a lot, but you really leave nothing at all 
 When you hear the small voice deep inside, and you follow his call 
 It may seem like a lot, but you've really left nothing at all

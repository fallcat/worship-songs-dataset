There was a wedding one warm Summer evening 
 A happy and festive affair 
 And Jesus and his five disciples attended 
 And even his mother was there 
 Oh, the singing and the dancing were merry 
 The eatin' and the drinkin' were fine 
 But then the unthinkable happened 
 And they ran out of wine 
 Mary told Jesus the problem 
 He said to her "Why involve me? 
 You should know just like I know 
 My time's not yet come to be." 
 But his mother just called all the servants 
 Pointed him out to the crew 
 She says,"That's the one who can fix it 
 Whatever he says to you, do." 
 There were six pots of stone there for washing 
 And when the servants came over to him 
 Jesus said, "Fill those pots up with water," 
 So they filled them right up to the brim 
 Then he said, "See the wedding director 
 The man with the scowl on his face? 
 Take a cup of that stuff in the pots now 
 Walk over, and give him a taste." 
 When the director had tasted 
 That miraculous, heavenly brew 
 Didn't know where it had come from 
 But the servants they all knew 
 So he called to the bridgegroom and told him 
 "This is the first-rule of party know-how 
 You serve the good stuff first, then bring out the worst 
 But you kept the best 'til now 
 You serve the good stuff first, then bring out the worst 
 But you kept the best 'til now." 
 So no matter the size of the problem 
 Or who made the biggest mistake 
 If it's just a personal matter 
 Or if the whole planet's at stake 
 Remember those words that were spoken 
 A mother's words ever so true 
 "Whatever he says to you, listen 
 Whatever he says to you, do 
 Whatever he says to you, listen 
 Whatever he says, whatever he says 
 Whatever he says you just do."

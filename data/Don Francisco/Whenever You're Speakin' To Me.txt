There's nothing I've heard that compares with Your word 
 To strengthen me and set me free 
 The joy deep inside that can't be denied 
 Whenever You're speakin' to me 
 Like a babbling brooke on its way down a hill 
 Now it's the natural thing to be doin' Your will 
 Everywhere that I go I just got to show 
 All the love that you've given to me 
 Way back at the start 
 When I gave you my heart 
 And You showed me the things I should do 
 Well I'm still on the track 
 And I not turnin' back 
 'Cause I know what You told me is true 
 Like the rain from the sky 
 On a thirsty land 
 Your word brought life to a dyin' man 
 From desert to garden 
 Condemnation to pardon 
 And all of the praise goes to you 
 Out on my own I couldn't find my home 
 I didn't know the right from the wrong 
 But with Your spirit inside and YOur word as my guide 
 I got a sense of direction so strong 
 Out on my own I couldn't find my home 
 I didn't know the right from the wrong 
 But with Your spirit inside and YOur word as my guide 
 I got a sense of direction so strong 
 There's nothing I've heard that compares with Your word 
 To strengthen me and set me free 
 The joy deep inside that can't be denied 
 Whenever You're speakin' to me 
 Like a babbling brooke on its way down a hill 
 Now it's the natural thing to be doin' Your will 
 Everywhere that I go I just got to show 
 All the love that you've given by the life I'm livin' to me 
 The love that you've given to me

Comes the time for lights to dim 
 Prayers and pillows, evening hymns 
 Cares and worries, joys and plans - 
 Time to leave them in His hands 
 Trust in Him upon your bed 
 On His promise rest your head 
 In His peace lie down and sleep 
 Through the night His watch He'll keep 
 Painful labor, sleepless eyes - 
 These won't make you rich or wise 
 But even now, and all night through 
 While you sleep God gives to you 
 So, in His peace lie down and sleep 
 Through the night His watch He'll keep 
 Cares and worries, joys and plans - 
 Leave them all now in His hands 
 Cares and worries, joys and plans - 
 Leave them all now in His hands.

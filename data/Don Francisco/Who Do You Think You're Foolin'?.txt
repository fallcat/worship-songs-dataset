You're acting like nobody knows it, 
 Thinkin' that you've hidden your sin, 
 Tellin' everybody everything's fine 
 But you're lyin' about the trouble you're in. 
 'Cos I've heard about all you've been doin' – 
 You know there's people talkin' all over town, 
 Dragging the name of the Saviour down to the ground? 
 Who do you think you're foolin' 
 When you gonna realise? 
 That all of your plans and your schemin' 
 They're layin' right before his eyes? 
 Your cheatin' and your dirty dealin', 
 Your sellin' your soul for a feelin' – 
 Who do you think you're foolin' 
 With those lies? 
 Satan he's watchin', laughin' at you 
 And the change you've let him put on your hands, 
 But there's people that you've never imagined, my friend, 
 Who are praying that you'll learn how to stand. 
 Because everything is naked and open 
 To the God with whom we have to do 
 So if there's anybody who's blind, I've got a feelin' it's you 
 Who do you think you're foolin' – 
 You're heading for a big surprise 
 That all of your plans and your schemin', 
 They're layin' right before his eyes. 
 Your cheatin' and your dirty dealin', 
 Your sellin' your soul for a feelin' – 
 Who do you think you're foolin' 
 With those lies? 
 Deep down inside you, you fear it; 
 You know you're gonna reap what you sow, 
 But as long as you're grieving the Spirit, 
 There ain't no decent place you can go. 
 Just keeps getting' harder and harder, 
 Harder to go down the line; 
 Oh, why won't you turn it around while you still got the time? 
 Who do you think you're foolin', 
 When you gonna realise? 
 That all of your plans, all your schemes, 
 Layin' right before his eyes. 
 Your cheatin' and your dirty dealin' 
 Your sellin' your soul for a feelin' 
 Who do you think you're foolin' 
 Think that the King isn't rulin'? 
 Who do you think you're foolin' 
 With those lies?

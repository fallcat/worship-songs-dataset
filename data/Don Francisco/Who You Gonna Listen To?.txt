Everybody's talkin' all day long 
 Everybody's singing a different song 
 Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong 
 And who you gonna listen to? 
 And you're needing an answer that gets down deep 
 Advice is nice but talk is cheap 
 And people's opinions don't help you sleep 
 Who you gonna listen to? 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to? 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to? 
 When you hear the truth and you let it through 
 Have you heard what the Lord's been saying to you 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to? 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to? 
 Up on a mountain or down in a hole 
 Sometimes hot, sometimes cold 
 Feelings and emotions won't save your soul 
 Who you gonna listen to? 
 People like the grass all whither away 
 Even this world will be gone some day 
 But the Word of the Lord never passes away 
 Who you gonna listen to? 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to? 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to? 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to? 
 When you hear the truth and you let it through 
 Have your heard what the Lord's been saying to you 
 Who? Who you gonna listen to?

Turned from my family, turned from my home 
 I lived like a beggar, I wandered and roamed 
 My life was just hopeless, till I heard His name 
 A prophet, they said, healed the sick and the lame 
 Well to find Him was easy, I followed the crowd 
 But I kept to the edges, crying out loud 
 "Unclean, unclean, stay out of my path 
 I'm an object of scorn, I'm a vessel of wrath" 
 There on the hillside, He taught us that day 
 I'd never heard anyone say what He'd say 
 And then He was done and His sermon complete 
 And, I ran and threw myself down at His feet 
 I said "Lord if You're willing, I know that You can 
 Make me as clean as a natural man 
 I know You can do it, deep down in my soul 
 Oh Lord, if You're willing, Lord, please make me whole" 
 With a voice of compassion, He told me to stand 
 "I'm willing," He said, and He reached out His hand 
 "Be cleaned," were the words that He spoke with a smile 
 And in an instant my skin was like that of a child 
 Now as time passes by, there is much we forget 
 But I'll always remember the day that I met 
 Jesus the Lord and His first words to me 
 "I'm willing," He said, and He healed even me 
 I'm willing to help you, I'm willing to heal 
 I've borne all your sufferings, I know how you feel 
 Your pain can be ended, my power is real 
 I'm willing to help you, I'm willing to heal 
 I will not deny you, I'm willing to heal

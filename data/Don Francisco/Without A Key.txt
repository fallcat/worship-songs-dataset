I call your name to come and see 
 I stand outside, without a key 
 Holding all you long to be 
 Until you open up to Me 
 The Holy Spirit, Father, Son, 
 Are waiting for you-all as One 
 To come and join you as you dine 
 We've brought it all - the food, the wine 
 So forget that picture in your head - 
 The tiny cup, the bite of bread 
 We've come to feast - our child is found! 
 We're here to pass the joy around 
 And when each meal is done and through 
 We'll even clean the mess with you 
 Then dance with you and all your friends 
 Until it's time to dine again 
 So don't pretend that you're not there 
 Or tied to duty Spartan spare 
 Or clothed in rags all stained with sin 
 Just let the One Who loves you in 
 I call your name to come and see 
 I'm still outside, without a Key 
 Holding all you long to be 
 Until you open up to Me.

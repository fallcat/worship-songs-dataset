I'm workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 I'm workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 It's got a firm foundation 
 Got a firm foundation 
 It's got a firm foundation 
 Not made by hands 
 (Not made by hands) 
 The cornerstone is Jesus 
 Cornerstone is Jesus 
 The cornerstone is Jesus 
 And it will stand 
 Now, if I worked down in the city 
 Tell just what I'd do 
 I'd do that job for Jesus 
 And I'd work on a buildin' too 
 If I was a trucker 
 Tell you 'bout what I'd do 
 I'd drive that rig just for my Lord 
 And work on a buildin' too 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 If I was a preacher 
 I'd preach that gospel true 
 And I'd walk that talk on Monday 
 And work on the buildin' too 
 And if I was a singer 
 I tell you just what I'd do 
 I'd sing about the love of Jesus 
 And work on the buildin' too 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 I'm workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 I'm workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 For my Lord 
 Workin' on a buildin' 
 I'm workin on a buildin' 
 For my Lord

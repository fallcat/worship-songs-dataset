There are songs of the struggles 
 Of death and of life 
 From deep in our longings 
 Passions and strife 
 But the songs of the Spirit 
 Are the ones that will last 
 For your fears for the future 
 And regrets for the past 
 From the cycles of seasons 
 To the hymns of the trees 
 From the laughter of children 
 To the prayers on our knees 
 Sweet choruses rise 
 Upon chords without ends 
 To the heart of our Saviour 
 Our brother and friend 
 You are in me 
 I am in you 
 You open the door 
 And new life is shown through 
 Now the dream of the ages 
 At last will come true 
 For you are in me 
 And I am in you 
 Your Spirits like fountains 
 Like rivers of rain 
 Flowing down from the mountains 
 To fill us again 
 Rising up like the wind 
 Back to heaven once more 
 Carries all of our worship 
 To the one we adore 
 And when two or more gather 
 In Jesus our King 
 The Spirit descends 
 Like a dove on the wing 
 And in a melody soft 
 Yet too great for a choir 
 You sing to your Bride 
 In your joy and desire 
 You are in me 
 I am in you 
 You've opened the door 
 New life is shown through 
 Now the dream of the ages 
 At last will come true 
 For you are in me 
 And I am in you 
 Now on horses uncountable 
 Thundering out 
 Come armies of angels 
 With a deafening shout 
 As the victor mounts out 
 On his stallion of white 
 And the trumpet-blast signals 
 The end of our night 
 The earth holds its breath 
 As the Son of God's love 
 Breaks through all the darkness 
 From heav'n above 
 And as faith becomes sight 
 And melts all of our fears 
 You lead out in the anthem 
 We've known through the years 
 You are in me 
 I am in you 
 Now the door is open wide 
 And new life is come through 
 The dream of the ages 
 At last has come true 
 For you are in me 
 And I am in you 
 You are in me 
 I am in you 
 Now the door's open wide 
 And new life is come through 
 The dream of the ages 
 At last has come true 
 For you are in me 
 And I am in you 
 You are in me 
 I am in you 
 Now the door is open wide 
 And new life is come through 
 The dream of the ages 
 At last has come true 
 For you are in me 
 And I am in you 
 You are in me 
 I am in you 
 Now the door's open wide 
 And new life is come through 
 The dream of the ages 
 At last has come true 
 For you are in me 
 And I am in you 
 You are in me 
 I am in you 
 Now the door's open wide 
 And new life is come through 
 The dream of the ages 
 At last has come true 
 For you are in me 
 And I am in you

Before you existed 
 I called you by name 
 Like my only Son 
 I've loved you the same 
 And now I've lifted you up 
 As my eternal friend 
 To share in my life 
 And my joy without end 
 But now in some dark corner 
 In guilt and in fear 
 You've been told you're unworthy 
 And you dare not come near 
 But even in your confusion 
 Your spirit shines through 
 And all I can see 
 Is my glory in you 
 You are the reason 
 That all this was done 
 You are the reason 
 I sent down my Son 
 You are the reason 
 I dance and I sing 
 You're my joy 
 Above everything 
 No-one comes before you 
 In all that I do 
 I dance with abandon 
 When I think of you 
 All of my heaven resounds 
 With the roar of my voice 
 As in triumph I sing 
 And I shout and rejoice 
 You are the reason 
 That all this was done 
 You are the reason 
 I sent down my Son 
 You are the reason 
 I dance and I sing 
 You're my joy 
 Above everything 
 From the instant the stars 
 All exploded in light 
 I've waited through time 
 For the wonderful sight 
 Of you standing in front of me 
 Forever free 
 And the love in your eyes 
 As they shine back at me 
 'Cause you are the reason 
 That all this was done 
 You are the reason 
 I sent down my Son 
 You are the reason 
 I dance and I sing 
 You're my joy 
 Above everything 
 'Cause you are the reason 
 That all this was done 
 You are the reason 
 I sent down my Son 
 You are the reason 
 I dance and I sing 
 You're my joy 
 Above everything 
 You're my joy 
 Above everything

Once there was a rich man 
 Who hoarded all his goods 
 Spent his money on himself 
 Didn't do the things he should 
 But one night Death knocked on his door 
 And called him on his bet 
 And all that money stayed behind 
 He'd worked so hard to get 
 And when Jesus met a rich young man 
 Who asked him what to do 
 So he could have eternal life 
 Jesus told him true 
 He said give the poor all that you have 
 And come and follow me 
 And you'll have a heavenly bank account 
 And live eternally 
 You can't take it with ya 
 You can't take it with ya 
 You can't take it with ya 
 Take it with ya when you're dead 
 You can't take it with ya 
 You can't take it with ya 
 You can't take it with ya 
 You gotta send it on ahead 
 There's no one whose left his house 
 His money or his lands 
 For the sake of Jesus 
 And the cross that he demands 
 And there's no one for Jesus sake 
 Who's left family or wife 
 Who won't receive a hundred-fold 
 And joy through all his life 
 You can take that with you 
 You can take that with you 
 You can take your joy on with you 
 Take it with you when you're dead 
 You can take it with ya 
 Your joy can sure go with ya 
 You can take it right on with ya 
 Take it with you when you're dead 
 You can take it with ya 
 Yeah, you can take it with ya 
 If you live like Jesus said...

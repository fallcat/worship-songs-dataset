A King is born this day in Bethlehem 
 Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!) 
 No crown is worn but angels worship Him 
 Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!) 
 Almighty God, He was meek and mild 
 Salvation comes through this holy Child 
 A King is born, (He is in the manger now) 
 A King is born,(humbly come and humbly bow) 
 A tiny Lord, (He's reaching out His tiny hand) 
 A King is born on this day, in Bethlehem 
 His palace is lowly, His throne is made of hay 
 Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!) 
 Shepherds bow down to see His holy face 
 Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!) 
 Heaven is singing of peace on earth 
 Filled with the wonder of this birth 
 A King is born, (He is in the manger now) 
 A King is born,(humbly come and humbly bow) 
 A tiny Lord, (He's reaching out His tiny hand) 
 A King is born on this day, in Bethlehem

 He's in the manger now 
 Come humbly and humbly bow 
 He's in the manger now 
 Come humbly and humbly bow 
 He's in the manger now

Lord You give me a voice for worship 
 A heart that seek Ye to honour You 
 Draw me closer in adoration 
 And lead this nation to worship You 
 Lord I thank You for every moment 
 Every day I can bless your name 
 Lord I give You my voice for worship 
 Songs of praise to Your holy Name 
 He put a new song in my mouth 
 A song of praise to my God 
 Many will see and feel 
 And put their trust in Him 
 Let the song begin 
 Let it rise from deep within 
 My heart unto Him 
 I will sing to the Lord forever 
 I will boldly proclaim His word 
 There is no higher name in heaven 
 There is no greater name on earth 
 He put a new song in your mouth 
 A song of praise to our God 
 Many will see and feel 
 And put their trust in Him 
 Let the song begin 
 Let it rise from deep within 
 Your heart unto Him 
 Jesus is Lord! 
 Jesus is Lord!

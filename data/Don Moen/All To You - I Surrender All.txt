All to you, All to You, 
 I give it all to You. 
 All to you, All to You, 
 I give it all to You. 
 I lay my life before You 
 Lord I surrender all 
 All that I have been through 
 I give it to You now 
 And though I have some questions, 
 Things I'll never understand 
 I come into Your presence 
 And I place them in Your hands. 
 All to you, All to You, 
 I give it all to You. 
 All to you, All to You, 
 I give it all to You. 
 I know that You are faithful 
 That Your promises are true 
 Your mercy will sustain me 
 And Your grace will see me through 
 So I lift my hands before You 
 As a sacrifice and praise 
 I cast my cares upon You 
 And I come to You in faith 
 All to you, All to You, 
 I give it all to You. 
 All to you, All to You, 
 I give it all to You. 
 I give it all to 
 I give it all to You

 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 All to him I freely give; 
 I will ever love and trust him, 
 I surrender all, I surrender all, 
 All to thee, my blessed Savior, 
 I surrender all. 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Humbly at his feet I bow, 
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken; 
 Take me, Jesus, take me now. 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Make me, Savior, wholly thine 
 Fill me with thy love and power; 
 Truly know that thou art mine. 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Lord, I give myself to thee; 
 Fill me with thy love and power; 
 Let thy blessing fall on me. 
 All to Jesus I surrender; 
 Now I feel the sacred flame. 
 O the joy of full salvation! 
 Glory, glory, to his name!

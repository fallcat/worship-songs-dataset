All we like sheep have gone astray, 
 Each of us turning our own separate way. 
 We all have sinned and fallen short of Your glory, 
 But Your glory is what we desire to see, 
 And in Your presence is where we long to be. 
 O Lord, show us Your mercy and grace, 
 Take us to Your holy place. 
 Forgive us our sins and heal our land, 
 We long to live in Your presence once again. 
 Taking our sickness and taking our pain, 
 Jesus, the sacrifice, the Lamb has been slain. 
 He was despised, rejected by men. He took our sin. 
 Draw us near to You, Father, through Jesus, Your Son, 
 Let us worship before You, cleansed by Your blood.

As we worship you 
 Key of D ascended to Key of F 
 As we worship You, let all the world come and see 
 How the mercy we received from You can set them free 
 As we worship You, let all this joy that fills our hearts 
 Bring a hunger and a hope to those who strayed so far 
 As we bow in adoration and stand in reverent awe 
 Show Your majesty and glory, let Your anointing fall 
 As we declare Your name Lord Jesus as the only name who saves 
 May the power of Your salvation fill each heart we pray 
 As we worship You, let all the nations hear our song 
 Song of Jesus and His blood that proved His love for all 
 As we worship You, may all the lost and broken come 
 May they hear Your still small voice call out their names each one 
 (Then ascend to Key of F for Verse I and Chorus) 
 Verse 1 (ascended) 
 As we worship You, let all the world come and see 
 How the mercy we received from You can set them free 
 As we worship You, let all this joy that fills our hearts 
 Bring a hunger and a hope to those who strayed so far 
 Chorus (ascended) 
 As we bow in adoration and stand in reverent awe 
 Show Your majesty and glory, let Your anointing fall 
 As we declare Your name Lord Jesus as the only Name who saves 
 May the power of Your salvation fill each heart we pray 
 As we worship You, as we worship You 
 As we worship You, as we worship You 
 As we worship You

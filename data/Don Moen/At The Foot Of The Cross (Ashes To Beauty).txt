At the foot of the cross 
 Where grace and suffering meet 
 You have shown me your love 
 Through the judgment you received 
 And you've won my heart 
 And you've won my heart, now I can 
 Trade these ashes in for beauty 
 And wear forgiveness like a crown 
 Coming to kiss the feet of mercy 
 I lay every burden down at the foot of the cross 
 At the foot of the cross 
 Where I am made complete 
 You have given me life 
 Through the death you bore for me 
 And you've won my heart 
 And you've won my heart, now I can 
 Trade these ashes in for beauty 
 And wear forgiveness like a crown 
 Coming to kiss the feet of mercy 
 I lay every burden down at the foot of the cross 
 And wear forgiveness like a crown 
 Coming to kiss the feet of mercy 
 I lay every burden down at the foot of the cross 
 And you've won my heart 
 And you've won my heart, now I can 
 Trade these ashes in for beauty 
 And wear forgiveness like a crown 
 Coming to kiss the feet of mercy 
 I lay every burden down 
 I trade these ashes in for beauty 
 And wear forgiveness like a crown 
 Coming to kiss the feet of mercy 
 I lay every burden down 
 I lay every burden down, every burden 
 I lay every burden down 
 At the foot of the cross 
 At the foot of the cross 
 At the foot of the cross 
 At the foot of the cross

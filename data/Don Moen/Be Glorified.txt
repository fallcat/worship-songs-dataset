With every beat of my heart 
 Every song that I sing 
 Every prayer that I pray 
 Every offering I bring 
 In every thought that I have 
 Every word that I say 
 Oh, be glorified (yeah, yeah) 
 From the start of each day 
 Till the end of the night 
 Let me bring praise 
 Let me bring light 
 Lord, I offer my life 
 As a sacrifice 
 Be glorified (yeah, yeah) 
 This is my prayer 
 It's the cry of my heart 
 Lord, I want my life 
 To reflect who You are 
 Oh Lord, please stir up the fire 
 And burn everything 
 Till all I desire is You 
 With every breath that I take 
 In everything that I do 
 Let me lift up Your name 
 And bring honor to You 
 Let the words of my mouth 
 Only speak truth 
 Oh, be glorified (yeah, yeah) 
 With every beat of my heart 
 Every song that I sing 
 Every prayer that I pray 
 Every offering I bring 
 In every thought that I have 
 Every word that I say 
 Be glorified oh Lord) 
 Be glorified (oh yes) 
 Be glorified (oh Lord) 
 Be glorified 
 In everything I say 
 Everything I do 
 (Be glorified) 
 In every situation 
 Every conversation 
 (Be glorified) 
 Oh God 
 It's my prayer 
 Be glorified

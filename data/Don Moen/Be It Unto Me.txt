Chorus:Be it unto me 
 According to your Word 
 According to your promises 
 I can stand secure 
 Carve upon my heart 
 The truth that sets me free 
 According to your Word O Lord 
 Be it unto me 
 You promised your word will deliver 
 Lord, we believe it's true 
 You promised us joy like a river 
 Lord we receive it from you 
 These things you have spoken 
 And you're bringing to pass 
 This world's disappearing 
 But your word will last 
 You promised to carry our sorrows 
 Lord, we believe it's true 
 You promised unending tomorrows 
 Lord we receive them from you 
 You'll be our Provider 
 In Your word it's revealed 
 By the strifes that You bore 
 Lord We have been healed

Let the broken-hearted sing 
 And the captives say, "I'm free" 
 In the praise we bring, oh God 
 Be lifted up 
 Be lifted up 
 Let the widow find new joy 
 And the weary man rejoice 
 In the praise we bring, oh God 
 Be lifted up 
 Be lifted up 
 In majesty, authority 
 In power, God, You reign 
 In everything over all that is 
 You are greater 
 You are greater 
 Let the song of every saint 
 Join the Heavens in high praise 
 As we worship You, oh God 
 Be lifted up 
 Be lifted up 
 Let Your glory fill the earth 
 Let Your glory fill the earth 
 Let Your glory fill the earth 
 Let the power of Your word 
 See the crippled man arise 
 And the lost become Your bride

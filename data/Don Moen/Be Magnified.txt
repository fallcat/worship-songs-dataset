I have made You too small in my eyes 
 O Lord, forgive me; 
 I have believed in a lie 
 That You were unable to help me. 
 But now, O Lord, I see my wrong 
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong; 
 And in my eyes and with my song 
 O Lord, be magnified 
 O Lord, be magnified. 
 Be magnified, O Lord 
 You are highly exalted; 
 And there is nothing You can't do 
 O Lord, my eyes are on You. 
 Be magnified, 
 O Lord, be magnified. 
 Be magnified, O Lord 
 You are highly exalted; 
 And there is nothing You can't do 
 O Lord, my eyes are on You. 
 Be magnified, 
 O Lord, be magnified. 
 I have leaned on the wisdom of men 
 O Lord, forgive me; 
 And I have responded to them 
 Instead of Your light and Your mercy. 
 But now, O Lord, I see my wrong 
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong; 
 And in my eyes with my song 
 O Lord, be magnified 
 O Lord, be magnified.

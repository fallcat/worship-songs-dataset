 From whom it all began

 And who gave life to man

 Created sky and ocean

 To save sinful men 
 You scorned the shame on the Cross 
 My sin, my blame is now gone 
 And here I stand 
 Beloved and called by name 
 Be praised

 Listen to your people 
 Lifting up Your name

 All praises to the One 
 From whom it all began 
 The One who conquered death 
 And who will come again 
 The nations will behold You 
 As everything becomes new 
 And here I'll stand 
 Beloved and called by name

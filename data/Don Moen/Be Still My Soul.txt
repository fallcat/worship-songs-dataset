 Lyrics - Be Still My Soul 
 Be still my soul 
 Be still my soul 
 Cease from the labor and the toil 
 Refreshing springs of peace await 
 The troubled minds and hearts that ache 
 Be still my soul 
 God knows your way 
 And He will guide 
 For His name's sake 
 Plunge in the rivers of His grace 
 Rest in the arms of His embrace 
 Be still my soul 
 Be still my soul 
 Though battles round you rage and roar 
 One thing you need and nothing more 
 To hear the whisper of your Lord 
 Be still My child 
 I know your way 
 And I will guide 
 For My name's sake 
 Plunge in the rivers of My grace 
 Rest in the arms of My embrace 
 Be still, be still my soul

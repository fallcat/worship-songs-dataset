We believe in God the Father 
 We believe in Christ the Son 
 We believe in the Holy Spirit 
 We are the Church 
 And we stand as one 
 We believe in the Holy Bible 
 We believe in the virgin birth 
 We believe in the resurrection 
 That Christ one day 
 Will return to earth 
 Holy holy 
 Holy is our God 
 Worthy worthy 
 Worthy is our King 
 All glory and honor 
 Are His to receive 
 To Jesus we sing 
 Because we believe 
 We believe in the blood of Jesus 
 We believe in eternal life 
 We believe in His love that frees us 
 To become the bride of Christ

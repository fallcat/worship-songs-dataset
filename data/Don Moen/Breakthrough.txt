Break through 
 Break through all my doubts 
 Break through 
 Break through all my fears 
 Break through 
 That I may worship You 
 Break through 
 Break through all my pain 
 Break through all my guilt and my shame 
 Break through like only You can do 
 You are brighter than my darkest night 
 Stronger than my toughest fight 
 Just one touch from You my King my Friend 
 And I'll never be the same again 
 O break through all my pain 
 Break through all my guilt and my shame 
 Break through like only You can do 
 O break through like only You can do 
 O break through like only You can do

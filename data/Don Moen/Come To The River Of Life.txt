Come to the river of life 
 You will find healing there 
 Come to the river of life 
 Come and drink freely here 
 Come if your heart is searching 
 O, come if your soul is thirsty 
 Draw near and drink of 
 The mercy of Jesus Christ, oh yes 
 And the river of life. 
 There is a river 
 Whose strems make glad 
 The city of God, the city of God 
 So come if you're wounded or sad 
 There is a river, there is a river 
 Come to the river of life 
 You will find healing there 
 Come to the river of life 
 Come and drink freely here 
 Come if your heart is searching 
 O, come if your soul is thirsty 
 Draw near and drink of 
 The mercy of Jesus Christ, oh yes 
 And the river of life. 
 It flows from the land of eternal life 
 Where there's no more sorrow 
 And no more night into the hearts 
 That are lifted to Him 
 Filling his children again and again and again 
 Come to the river of life 
 You will find healing there 
 Come to the river of life 
 Come and drink freely here 
 Come if your heart is searching 
 O, come if your soul is thirsty 
 Draw near and drink of 
 The mercy of Jesus Christ, oh yes 
 And the river of life. 
 Draw near and drink of 
 The mercy of Jesus CHrist 
 At the river of life.

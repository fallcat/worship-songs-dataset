You who made the mountains and the sea 
 Measured out the universe and You made me 
 Echoes of the voice that called the worlds to be 
 Reach throughout the ages and now speak to me 
 You're my Creator King 
 You who made the valleys and the skies 
 Displayed Your love on far horizons and before my eyes 
 You who lit the stars and set the dawn in time 
 Called them all by name and now You whisper mine 
 You're my Creator King 
 Who am I that You are mindful of me? Yeah 
 Who am I that You sent Your love on me? 
 You're my Creator King 
 You who made the darkness and the light 
 Sun and moon to watch the day and guard the night 
 The hand that stretched the Heavens like a canopy 
 Reaches down to cover and watch over me 
 You're my Creator King 
 Who am I? Who am I that You are mindful of me? 
 Who am I that You sent Your love on me? 
 Who am I that You are mindful of me? 
 Who am I that You sent Your love on me? Yeah 
 You're my Creator King, You're my Creator King 
 You're my Creator King, You're my Creator King

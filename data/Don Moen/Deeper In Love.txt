There is a longing 
 Only You can fill 
 A raging tempest 
 Only You can still 
 My soul is thirsty Lord 
 To know You as I'm known 
 Drink from the river 
 That flows before Your throne 
 Take me deeper 
 Deeper in love with You 
 Jesus hold me close in Your embrace 
 Take me deeper 
 Deeper than I've ever been before 
 I just want to love You more and more 
 How I long to be deeper in love 
 Sunrise to sunrise 
 I will seek Your face 
 Drawn by the Spirit 
 To the promise of Your grace 
 My heart has found in You 
 A hope that will abide 
 Here in Your presence 
 Forever satisfied 
 (Repeat Chorus 2 times) 
 How I long to be deeper in love

O see the man of sorrow 
 See the Son of God 
 Stripped of Heaven's glory 
 In the name of relentlesslove 
 Pure and undeserved 
 Sure as Calvary 
 Weighed upon His shoulders 
 All our grief 
 Our iniquity 
 Alleluia Alleluia 
 Praise be to God 
 Alleluia 
 O hear the scoffer mocking 
 See the Savior's tears 
 Wounded and forsaken 
 Son of Man 
 Oh behold Himhere 
 In the stead of failing 
 Burdened by despair 
 It was more than nails 
 Love alone 
 Is what kept Him there 
 Alleluia Alleluia 
 Praise be to God 
 Alleluia 
 O for the joy before Him 
 He was crucified 
 And the grave defeated 
 Through His death 
 He has ransomed 
 Life for the crippled sinner 
 And His stripes for pain 
 Every curse now broken 
 We receive this Divine Exchange 
 Alleluia Alleluia 
 Praise be to God 
 Alleluia Alleluia 
 Praise be to God 
 Alleluia

Oh God of Abraham 
 You are the great I am 
 And You can do anything 
 Oh, anything 
 Oh God of sovereign words 
 You spoke the universe 
 And You can do anything 
 You can do anything 
 Oh God of Israel 
 You are Emmanuel 
 And You are in everything 
 In everything 
 Oh God of deity 
 You reign in majesty 
 And You can do anything 
 You can do anything 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 Oh, there's none like You 
 Oh God of grace divine 
 Your love has made me Thine 
 And You are my everything 
 My everything 
 Oh God of ancient praise 
 Be glorified today 
 As we give You everything 
 We give Your everything 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 Oh, there's none like You 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 Oh, there's none like You 
 Oh God of all my prayers 
 I know You're always there 
 And You can do anything 
 You can do anything

For all You've done 
 For all You're going to do 
 We give You thanks 
 And lift our praise to You 
 We give thanks 
 We give praise 
 For we know 
 That all things work together 
 For our good 
 We give thanks 
 We give praise 
 For by faith 
 We know Your grace 
 Will see us through 
 For all those things 
 That we don't understand 
 We come by faith 
 And place them in Your hands 
 Even if we stumble 
 Even if we fall 
 You will not forsake us 
 You are King and Lord of all 
 Lord of all

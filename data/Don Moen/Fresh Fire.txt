Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 We are hungry we are thirsty 
 Crying our for more of You 
 Lord we are desperate for Your mercy 
 Let us burn to know Your Truth 
 Light a flame in us now 
 Send Your holy fire down 
 Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 We have left our hearts unguarded 
 We confess we've walked away 
 Lord take us back to where we started 
 Where we first found love and grace 
 Light a flame in us now 
 Send Your holy fire down 
 Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 More of Your love 
 More of Your power 
 Send a revival 
 We need it now 
 Stir up a fire 
 Let it burn brighter 
 Let the flame burn higher higher higher 
 Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 Fresh fire let it fall 
 O God hear our call 
 Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind 
 We need fresh fire 
 Revive us again

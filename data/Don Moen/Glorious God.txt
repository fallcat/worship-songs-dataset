O, what a glorious God 
 O, what a powerful savior 
 All creation cries out around you 
 Holy is the Lord. 
 O what a glorious God 
 O what a powerful savior 
 Mercy grace and goodness 
 Surround you 
 O-oh what a glorious God 
 O-oh what a glorious God 
 You speak with a voice 
 Like a crashing cymbal 
 O-Oh what a glorious God 
 You stretch forth your hand 
 And the whole world trembles 
 O-Oh what a glorious God. 
 You rose from the dead 
 To redeem your people 
 O-Oh what a glorious God. 
 You give us your strength 
 And we soar like eagles 
 O-Oh what a glorious God. 
 The Lord has made 
 Known his salvation 
 His righteousness is shown 
 To every na-tion. 
 O-oh what a glorious God.

Who holds the heavens in his hands 
 Who made the stars by the word of his power 
 Who put the spirit in man 
 And causes all the earth to cry out glory 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Worship him 
 The God of our salvation 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Honor him, He reigns 
 He rules the nations 
 He is righteous and worthy 
 To be woshiped and adored 
 Lift your voices and give 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Who holds the righteous by the hand 
 Who is the way in this marvelous hour 
 Who stirs the heart of man 
 And causes all his saints to cry out glory 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Worship him 
 The God of our salvation 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Honor him, He reigns 
 He rules the nations 
 He is righteous and worthy 
 To be woshiped and adored 
 Lift your voices and give 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Worship him 
 The God of our salvation 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Honor him, He reigns 
 He rules the nations 
 He is righteous and worthy 
 To be woshiped and adored 
 Lift your voices and give 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Glory to the Lord 
 Glory to the Lord

 All the time. 
 Through the Darkest night, His Light will shine

 God is Good all the time 
 That's right, listen 
 - spoken 
 If You're walking through the valleys 
 And there are shadows all around 
 Do not fear, He will guide you 
 He will keep you safe and sound 
 He has promised to never leave you 
 Nor forsake you, and his word is true.

 All the time, 
 He put a song of Praise in this heart of mine 
 God is Good, 
 All the time. 
 Through the Darkest night, His Light will shine 
 God is Good, God is Good all the time 
 Yes He is spoken 
 - spoken 
 We are Sinners and so unworthy 
 Still for us he chose to die 
 Filled us with his Holy Spirit 
 Now we can stand and testify 
 That His love is everlasting 
 And his mercies, 
 They will never end. 
 God is Good, 
 All the time, 
 He put a song of Praise in this heart of mine 
 God is Good, 
 All the time. 
 Through the Darkest night, His Light will shine 
 God is Good, God is Good all the time 
 Yes, He is 
 - spoken 
 Though I may not understand 
 All the plans you have for me 
 My life is in Your hands 
 And through the eyes of faint 
 I can clearly see that... 
 God is Good, 
 All the time, 
 He put a song of Praise in the heart of mine 
 God is Good, 
 All the time. 
 Through the Darkest night, His Light will shine 
 God is Good, God is Good all the time 
 God is Good, 
 All the time, 
 He put a song of Praise in this heart of mine 
 God is Good, 
 All the time. 
 Through the Darkest night, His Light will shine 
 God is Good, God is Good 
 God is Good, He's so Good 
 God is Good, He's so Good 
 Yeah 
 All the time

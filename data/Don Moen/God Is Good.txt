God is good 
 We sing and shout it 
 God is good 
 We celebrate 
 God is good 
 No more we doubt it 
 Gos is good 
 We know it's true 
 And when I think 
 Of his love for me 
 My heart fills with praise 
 And I feel like dancing 
 For in his heart 
 There is no room for me 
 And I run with arms 
 Opened wide

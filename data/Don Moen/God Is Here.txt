God is here 
 Dwelling in the praise of His people 
 God is near 
 Healing broken hearts with His touch 
 As we gather to worship His name 
 He is riding on the wings of our praise 
 I believe I believe that God is here 
 Are you weary heavy laden 
 Come and He will give you rest 
 It is written 
 It's a promise 
 That is what our Savior said 
 And He's promised 
 To be right here with us 
 As we come together in His name 
 Wounded soldier from the battle 
 Feeling like you're losing ground 
 Just surrender to His Spirit 
 The victory will be safe and sound 
 If you're hungry come and feast at His table 
 If you're thirsty come and you will be filled 
 As we gather to worship His name 
 He is riding on the wings of our praise 
 I believe I believe that God is here 
 I believe I believe that God is here 
 I believe I believe that God is here

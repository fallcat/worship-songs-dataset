Whom have I in heaven but You 
 There is nothing on earth I desire beside You 
 My heart and my strength many times they fail 
 But there is one truth that always will prevail 
 God is the strength of my heart 
 God is the strength of my heart 
 God is the strength of my heart 
 And my portion forever, forever 
 (Repeat Chorus twice) 
 Forever, forever, forever... 
 Forever

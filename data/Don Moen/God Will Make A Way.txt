God will make a way 
 Where there seems to be no way 
 He works in ways we cannot see 
 He will make a way for me 
 He will be my guide 
 Hold me closely to His side 
 With love and strength for each new day 
 He will make a way 
 He will make a way 
 Oh, God will make a way 
 Where there seems to be no way 
 He works in ways we cannot see 
 He will make a way for me 
 He will be my guide 
 Hold me closely to His side 
 With love and strength for each new day 
 He will make a way 
 He will make a way 
 By a roadway in the wilderness 
 He'll lead me 
 Rivers in the desert will I see 
 Heaven and earth will fade 
 But His Word will still remain 
 And He will do something new today 
 Oh, God will make a way 
 Where there seems to be no way 
 He works in ways we cannot see 
 He will make a way for me 
 He will be my guide 
 Hold me closely to His side 
 With love and strength for each new day 
 He will make a way 
 He will make a way 
 By a roadway in the wilderness 
 He'll lead me 
 Rivers in the desert will I see 
 Heaven and earth will fade 
 But His Word will still remain 
 And He will do something new today 
 Oh, God will make a way 
 Where there seems to be no way 
 He works in ways we cannot see 
 He will make a way for me 
 He will be my guide 
 Hold me closely to His side 
 With love and strength for each new day 
 He will make a way 
 He will make a way 
 With love and strength for each new day 
 He will make a way 
 He will make a way

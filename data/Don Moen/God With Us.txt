He walked where I walked 
 He stood where I stand 
 He felt what I feel 
 He understands 
 He knows my frailty 
 Shared my humanity 
 Tempted in every way 
 Yet without sin 
 God with us! 
 So close to us 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel 
 God with us! 
 So close to us 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel 
 One of a hated race 
 Stung by the prejudice 
 Suffering injustice 
 Yet He forgives! 
 Wept for my wasted years 
 He paid for my wickedness 
 He died in my place 
 That I might live 
 God with us! 
 So close to us 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel...

 God is good 
 God is good 
 We sing and shout it 
 God is good 
 We celebrate 
 God is good 
 No more we doubt it 
 God is good 
 We know it's true 
 And when I think of His love for me 
 My heart fills with praise and I feel like dancing 
 For in His heart there is no room for me 
 And I run with arms open wide 
 Now unto the king eternal 
 Now unto the King eternal 
 Unto the reigning King 
 Unto the Lord Almighty 
 Praises I will sing 
 To the King eternal 
 Sing to the King of kings 
 Sing to declare His glory 
 Let His praises ring 
 So I will lift my hands 
 In joy before the King 
 I lift my hands in praise 
 I lift my heart in joyful jubilation 
 I lift my voice in praise 
 And I will shout "blessing" to the King 
 And I will shout "glory" to the King 
 And I will shout "honor" to the King 
 And I will shout "power" to the King 
 Declaring blessing and glory 
 And honor and power 
 Belong to Jesus the King of kings

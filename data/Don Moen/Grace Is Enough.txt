I can boast to many works 
 Done out of insecurity 
 And credit many conversations 
 To my immaturity 
 And while I'm misunderstood 
 You are understanding me 
 And showing me 
 How grace is enough 
 For everything that I've done right 
 Seems like a thousand I've done wrong 
 And I keep on losing count 
 Of all the times my flesh has won 
 And when the light of Christ that's in me 
 Is overshadowed by the fall 
 You're showing me 
 How grace is enough 
 When I feel unworthy 
 And so undeserving 
 Still I can come, just as I am 
 For I find Your love 
 Is free of condition 
 So I will run to Your wide open arms 
 Where I am accepted 
 And I am forgiven 
 Grace is enough for me 
 Your grace is enough for me 
 I've been quick at passing judgment 
 When I'm worthy of conviction 
 And the times I've measured virtue 
 Only based on my religion 
 But theology it seems 
 It's not the things that's saving me 
 Your are showing me 
 A grace that's enough 
 When I feel unworthy 
 And so undeserving 
 Though I was blind, now I see 
 Sweet is the sound 
 Of Your grace over me 
 You said it all on the Cross 
 Your grace goes beyond 
 All that I've done 
 When I feel unworthy 
 And so undeserving 
 You love me beyond 
 All my failing and hurting 
 It's not who I am 
 But who I can be 
 And I know You are working 
 Your purpose in me 
 Your grace is enough 
 More than enough 
 Your grace is enough for me

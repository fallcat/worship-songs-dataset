 Thank You for Your Blood 
 That's made a way 
 To come into Your presence 
 And glorify Your Name 
 Lord, I stand amazed at what I see 
 Great is Your mercy toward me

 Day after day 
 Forever faithful to me 
 Always providing for me 
 Great is Your mercy toward me 
 Great is Your grace 
 Your promises are ageless 
 Your Love will never end 
 To a thousand generations 
 Your covenant will stand 
 Showing grace and mercy 
 To those who fear Your name 
 Establishing Your righteousness and praise

Bright morning star 
 King of all days 
 Reign in our hearts 
 And ride on our praise 
 You are crowned in majesty 
 Awaken us now 
 Set us ablaze 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Let Your name be raised 
 Hear the song of the redeemed 
 Be exalted as we sing 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the living Word 
 Let praise arise 
 Heaven and earth 
 Sing praise to the Lamb 
 Seated on the throne 
 Power and strength 
 Are Yours alone 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the King 
 (Repeat from Verse 1) 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the living Word 
 Let praise arise 
 Heaven and earth 
 Sing praise to the Lamb 
 Seated on the throne 
 Power and strength 
 Are Yours alone 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the King (oh yeah, Emanuel) 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the King 
 Hear the song of the redeemed 
 Be exalted as we sing 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the living Word 
 Let praise arise 
 Heaven and earth 
 Sing praise to the Lamb 
 Seated on the throne 
 Power and strength 
 Are Yours alone 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the King (yeah yeah yeah, Emanuel) 
 Hail to the King 
 Hail to the King

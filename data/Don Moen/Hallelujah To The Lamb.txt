Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude 
 Of those from every tribe and tongue 
 We are Your people redeemed by Your blood 
 Rescued from death by Your love 
 There are no words 
 Good enough to thank You 
 There are no words to express my praise 
 But I will lift up my voice 
 And sing from my heart 
 With all of my strength 
 Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 
 To the Lamb 
 Hallelujah hallelujah 
 By the blood of Christ we stand 
 Every tongue every tribe 
 Every people every land 
 Giving glory giving honor 
 Giving praise unto the Lamb of God 
 Lord we stand by grace in Your presence 
 Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb 
 We are Your children called by Your name 
 Humbly we bow and we pray 
 Release Your power 
 To work in us and through us 
 Till we are changed 
 To be more like You 
 Then all the nations will see 
 Your glory revealed 
 And worship You 
 Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 
 To the Lamb 
 Hallelujah hallelujah 
 By the blood of Christ we stand 
 Every tongue every tribe 
 Every people every land 
 Giving glory giving honor 
 Giving praise unto the Lamb of God 
 Every knee shall bow 
 Every tongue confess 
 That You are Lord of all 
 Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 
 To the Lamb 
 Hallelujah hallelujah 
 By the blood of Christ we stand 
 Every tongue every tribe 
 Every people every land 
 Giving glory giving honor 
 Giving praise unto the Lamb of God 
 Giving praise unto the Lamb of God 
 Giving praise unto the Lamb of God 
 Jesus Christ Lamb of God

He set you free 
 So you could see 
 How much He loves you 
 Just take a look 
 It's in His book 
 How much He loves you 
 His Word reveals 
 All that He feels 
 He spelled it out 
 Never a doubt 
 He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 There's nothing you can do to make Him love you more 
 There's nothing you can do to make Him love you less 
 He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 Once we were lost 
 Needing the cross 
 Needing a Savior 
 He came to earth 
 A humble birth 
 Born in a manger 
 His words were truth 
 His life was proof 
 He was God's Son 
 Sent for each one 
 He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 There's nothing you can do to make Him love you more 
 There's nothing you can do to make Him love you less 
 He loves you 
 Just because He loves you 
 Just because He loves you

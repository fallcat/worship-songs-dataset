Here we are lifting our hands to you 
 Here we are, giving you thanks for all you do 
 As we praise, and worship your holy name 
 You are here, dwelling within our praise 
 For every answer prayer 
 For always being there 
 For love that hears us when we call 
 For arms that lift us when we fall 
 Oh you have always been, right beside us 
 Leading us all along the way 
 And we made it through (we made it through) 
 Because of you 
 And here we are 
 For days we cannot see (for days we cannot see) 
 For all that yet to be (so much is yet to be) 
 The trials we may have to face 
 When we'll be leaning on your grace 
 It will be your strength, that safe's us 
 Your love that makes us strong 
 And through it all (through it all) 
 We'll sing this song

You have been good to me 
 You have been good to me 
 You have been gracious 
 You have been faithful 
 Meeting my needs 
 Lord, it's so plain to see 
 You have been good to me 
 I have been given so much I can't even 
 Begin to thank You 
 And still I believe there is more 
 I believe there is more 
 I believe 
 So open my hands to receive 
 All that Your love has in store 
 Lord, I believe 
 Everything I have done 
 All that I've said and sung 
 Lifting Your story giving You glory 
 That's just the beginning 
 Father, I know there is more 
 Power to heal and restore 
 Miracles wonders blessings unnumbered 
 Love never-ending 
 Exceeding abundantly 
 More than our minds can imagine 
 Love overflowing 
 You are bestowing 
 Day after day after day 
 Lord, I believe 
 Lord, I believe 
 Lord, I believe

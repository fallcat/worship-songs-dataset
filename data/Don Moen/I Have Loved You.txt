I have loved You 
 With an everlasting love 
 I have drawn you 
 With My loving kindness (x3) 
 Because God loved you and to keep His own 
 He brought you out with a mighty hand 
 He redeemed you from the Devil's Yoke 
 Oh the Lord He is the God 
 And faithful is HE 
 He'll Keep His word and His covenant 
 Giving mercy and propserity 
 I have loved You 
 With an everlasting love 
 I have drawn you 
 With My loving kindness (x3)

I just want to be where you are 
 Dwelling daily in your presence 
 I don't want to worship from afar 
 Draw me near to where you are 
 I just want to be where you are 
 In your dwlling place forever 
 Take me to the place where you are 
 'Cause I just want to be with you 
 I want to be where you are 
 Dwelling in your presence 
 Feasting at your table 
 Surrounded by your glory 
 In your presence 
 That's where I always want to be 
 I just want to be, 
 I just want to be with you 
 I just want to be where you are 
 To enter boldly in you presence 
 I don't want to worship from afar 
 Draw me near to where you are 
 O my God, you are my strength and my song 
 And when I'm in your presence 
 Though I'm weak You're always strong 
 I just want to be where you are 
 In your dwlling place forever 
 Take me to the place where you are 
 'Cause I just want to be 
 I just want to be with you 
 I just want to be 
 I just want to be with you 
 I just want to be 
 I just want to be with you

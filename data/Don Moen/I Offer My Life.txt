All that I am, all that I have 
 I lay them down before you, oh Lord 
 All my regrets, all my acclaims 
 The joy and the pain, I'm making them yours 
 Lord, I offer my life to you 
 Everything I've been through 
 Use it for your glory 
 Lord I offer my days to you 
 Lifting my praise to you 
 As a pleasing sacrifice 
 Lord I offer you my life 
 Things in the past, things yet unseen 
 Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true 
 All of my heart, alll of my praise 
 My heart and my hands are lifted to you 
 Lord, I offer my life to you 
 Everything I've been through 
 Use it for your glory 
 Lord I offer my days to you 
 Lifting my praise to you 
 As a pleasing sacrifice 
 Lord I offer you my life 
 What can we give 
 That you have not given? 
 And what do we have 
 That is not already yours? 
 All we possess 
 Are these lives we're living 
 That's what we give to you, Lord 
 Lord, I offer my life to you 
 Everything I've been through 
 Use it for your glory 
 Lord I offer my days to you 
 Lifting my praise to you 
 As a pleasing sacrifice 
 Lord I offer you my life 
 Lord, I offer my life to you 
 Everything I've been through 
 Use it for your glory 
 Lord I offer my days to you 
 Lifting my praise to you 
 As a pleasing sacrifice 
 Lord I offer you my life 
 Lord I offer you my life

I just want to be where You are 
 Dwelling daily in Your presence 
 I don't want to worship from afar 
 Draw me near to where You are 
 I just want to be where You are 
 In Your dwelling place - spoken 
 In Your dwelling place forever 
 Take me to the place where You are 
 I just want to be with You 
 I want to be where You are 
 Dwelling in Your presence 
 Feasting at Your table 
 And surrounded by Your glory 
 In Your presence 
 That's where I always want to be 
 I just want to be 
 I just want to be with You 
 I just want to be where You are 
 Dwelling daily in Your presence - spoken 
 Dwelling daily in Your presence 
 I don't want to worship from afar 
 Draw me - spoken 
 Draw me near to where You are 
 O my God You are my strength and my song 
 And when I'm in Your presence 
 Though I'm weak, You're always strong 
 I just want to be where You are 
 In Your dwelling place forever - spoken 
 In Your dwelling place forever 
 Take me to the place - spoken 
 Take me to the place where You are 
 'Cause I just want to be 
 I just want to be with You 
 I just want to be 
 I just want to be with You

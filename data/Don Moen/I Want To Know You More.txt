One thing have I desired 
 Forever will I see 
 To behold the beauty of His holy name 
 And to dwell within the presence of the King 
 How could I ask for more 
 He's done so much for me 
 For I have tasted of the goodness of the Lord 
 And I've feasted at the table of the King 
 I just want to know Him more 
 I just want to know Him more 
 I just want to know Him more 
 I just want to know Him more 
 You've called me by Your name 
 And You've filled me with your love 
 You have covered with mercy and with grace 
 And have showered me with blessings from above 
 And yet I know there's more 
 I hear You calling me 
 To a place where I have never been before 
 Where Your love is flowing 
 Deeper than the sea 
 I just want to know Him more 
 I just want to know Him more 
 I just want to know You more 
 I just want to know You more 
 Open my eyes 
 Lord I want to see 
 All you have promised and given to me 
 I want to know the secrets that are hidden in your word 
 I want to know You 
 I want to know You 
 One day I'll see your face 
 And I'll look into Your eyes 
 And to all eternity I'll sing your praise 
 And forevermore fulfil my heart's desire 
 I just want to know You more 
 I just want to know You more 
 I just want to know You more 
 I just want to know You more

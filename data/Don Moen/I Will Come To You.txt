I Will Come To You 
 I will come to You 
 You have the words of life 
 I will come to You 
 You are the door 
 I will come to You 
 You are the Light of Life 
 I will come to You 
 For You are Lord 
 You have laid down Your life 
 To forgive my sins 
 And You've made a way for me 
 To be born again 
 By Your stripes I am healed 
 In Your presence I'm filled 
 I hear You calling and now I come 
 I Will Come To You 
 I will come to You 
 You have the words of life 
 I will come to You 
 You are the door 
 I will come to You 
 You are the Light of Life 
 I will come to You 
 For You are Lord

I will rejoice 
 I'm gonna lift my voice 
 And worship you. 
 And glorify your name 
 Among the nations 
 I will rejoice 
 In everything I will give thanks 
 To you, for you have been 
 My help and my salvation 
 Every step I take 
 I feel your love around me 
 I can not escape your grace 
 I can not explain the 
 Blessings that surround me 
 I can only sing your praise 
 I have made a choice 
 To offer up thanksgiving 
 Lifting up your holy name 
 I will lift my voice 
 And come before you singing 
 With this sacrifice of praise.

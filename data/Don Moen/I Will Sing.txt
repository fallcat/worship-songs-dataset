Lord You seem so far away. A million miles or more it feels today. 
 And though I haven 
 t lost my faith, I must confess right now that it 
 s hard for me to pray. 
 But I don 
 t know what to say and I don 
 t know where to start. 
 But as you give the grace with all that 
 s in my heart. 
 I will sing. 
 I will praise even in my darkest time through the sorrow and the pain. 
 I will sing. I will praise. 
 Lift my hands to honor You because Your word is true. I will sing. 
 Lord it's hard for me to see all the thoughts and plans You have for me. 
 But I will put my trust in You. Knowing that you died to set me free. 
 But I don 
 t know what to say and I don 
 t know where to start. 
 But as you give the grace with all that 
 s in my heart. 
 I will sing. 
 I will praise even in my darkest time through the sorrow and the pain. 
 I will sing. I will praise. 
 Lift my hands to honor You because Your word is true. I will sing. (2 times)

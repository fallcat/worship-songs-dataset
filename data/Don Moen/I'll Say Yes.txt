My heart is humbled 
 I've heard You speak 
 There's no denying 
 You're calling me 
 To follow You, Lord 
 As You lead me to life 
 And casting aside any fear, any pride 
 I'll say yes, Lord 
 I'll say yes 
 I surrender to Your Word 
 To the truth that I have heard 
 I'll say yes, Lord 
 I'll say yes 
 I will follow You in faith 
 And I walk in all Your ways 
 I'll obey 
 I'll say yes 
 Here in Your presence 
 I am complete 
 Your spirit is stirring 
 You're calling me 
 So I give You my heart 
 I offer my life 
 And casting aside any fear, any pride 
 I'll say yes 
 I'll say yes 
 I'll say yes 
 I'll say yes 
 Background: 
 To Your will

 To Your purpose, Lord 
 Everyday of my life 
 Lord, I'm living for You 
 Whatever You need 
 Whatever You say 
 Wherever You lead 
 I will obey 
 Yes to Your will 
 Yes to Your ways 
 I'm gonna serve You 
 All of my days

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, 
 When sorrows like sea billows roll; 
 Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say, 
 It is well, it is well, with my soul. 
 It is well, it is well, 
 With my soul, with my soul, 
 It is well, it is well, with my soul. 
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, 
 Let this blest assurance control, 
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate, 
 And hath shed His own blood for my soul. 
 It is well, It is well, 
 With my soul, with my soul 
 It is well, it is well, with my soul. 
 My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought! 
 My sin, not in part but the whole, 
 It was nailed trough his cross, and I bear it no more, 
 Bless the Lord, bless the Lord, O my soul! 
 It is well, It is well 
 With my soul, with my soul 
 It is well, it is well, with my soul

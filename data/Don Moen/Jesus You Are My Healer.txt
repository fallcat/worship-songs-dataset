Jesus, Son of God 
 Only You can save me 
 Suffering on the cross 
 You gave Your all 
 Willingly paid the cost for me 
 Now I am free to worship 
 Jesus, You are my healer 
 O Jesus, touch me and I will be free 
 Lord by Your stripes I am healed 
 O Jesus, You are my savior 
 O Jesus, You are my strength and my shield 
 I put my trust in Your name 
 In Your name, Jesus 
 Lord Your name is great 
 A refuge I can run to 
 A shelter from the storm 
 A faithful friend 
 And I can depend on You 
 My God, my King 
 I lift my voice and worship 
 Jesus, You are my healer 
 O Jesus, touch me and I will be free 
 Lord by Your stripes I am healed 
 O Jesus, You are my savior 
 O Jesus, You are my strength and my shield 
 I put my trust in Your name 
 In Your name, Jesus 
 O Jesus, Jesus 
 O Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...

Jesus, you are so good 
 Jesus, you are so good 
 There's nothing to fear 
 'Cause I'm here in Your presence 
 Jesus, you are so good 
 Jesus, you are so good 
 And I just want to thank you 
 With every beat of my heart 
 You've given me eternal life 
 And Your Word to light my way 
 You've given me Your Spirit 
 With new mercies every day 
 You've given me a confidence 
 And my soul is filled with peace 
 For You are a provider 
 You supply my every need

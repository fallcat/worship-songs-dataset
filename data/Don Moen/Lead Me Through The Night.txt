Lord You are 
 My refuge and my shelter 
 In Your presence I will hide 
 I Will wait for the God of my salvation 
 He will hear me when I cry 
 Though I fall 
 I will rise 
 High above the storm 
 Like an eagle I will fly 
 In the dark 
 You are my light 
 Bright and morning star 
 Come and lead me through the night 
 O lead me through the night 
 Lord You are my help in times of trouble 
 When others leave You will abide (yes, You will) 
 You're a friend that's closer than a brother 
 You will never leave my side 
 Lead me through the night 
 Lead me through the night

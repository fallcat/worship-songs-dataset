Lift up your heads, oh you gates 
 Swing open wide, you ancient doors 
 Let the King of kings take his rightful place 
 Make room, make way for the King of grace 
 Lift up your hands, open up your hearts 
 His victory over sin and death is ours 
 Let the King of kings take his rightful place 
 Make room, make way for our King of grace 
 Who is this King of glory, Lord of power? 
 His name is Jesus, our risen King 
 Who is this King so mighty, Lord of strength? 
 His name is Jesus, our risen King 
 Lift up your hands, open up your hearts 
 His victory over sin and death is ours 
 Let the King of kings take his rightful place 
 Make room, make way for our King of grace 
 Who is this King of glory, Lord of power? 
 His name is Jesus our risen King 
 Who is this King so mighty, Lord of strength? 
 His name is Jesus our risen King 
 Who is this King of glory, Lord of power? 
 His name is Jesus our risen King 
 Who is this King so mighty, Lord of strength? 
 His name is Jesus our risen King 
 King of glory, Lord of power 
 King of glory, Lord of power 
 King of glory, Lord of power 
 King of glory, Lord of power

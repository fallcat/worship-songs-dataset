Like a father feedsHis childrenLike a shepherdLeads his flockThe Lord willAlways guide usShow us where to walkAnd in times whenWe have plentyIn times whenWe have notHe is our ProviderAnd His mercyNever stops 
 Like a shepherdHe leads usLike a fatherHe feeds usFrom the morningTo the eveningTill the sunrise againLike a shepherdHe leads usLike a fatherHe feeds usHe is the great I AM 
 As we comeInto His presenceConfessing Him as LordHis Holy Spirit leads usAnd He feeds usBy His wordWe're seated at His tablePartaking of His loveChildren of His kingdomPurchased by His blood

O my soul, do you not know? 
 Have you not heard? 
 It's been told from the beginning 
 The Lord your God is on your side 
 O my soul, don't be afraid 
 Hope in the Lord 
 By His righteousness and power 
 He will strengthen, He will guide 
 And I will soar on wings like eagles 
 Held by the hand of God 
 I will run and not grow tired 
 When on His name I call 
 For the Lord is never weary 
 His ways are beyond my thoughts 
 I will trust in Him 
 With all my heart

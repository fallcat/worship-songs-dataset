For the heart (that's) bruised and broken 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 For the prayer (that's) left unspoken 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 For the shame (that's) separating 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 In our fear and all our failing 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 We lift a song in the light of our need 
 For You are able always in all things 
 And in this moment we fall at Your feet 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 For our hurt (that's) held so deeply 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 For the dream (that's) lost completely 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 We lift a song in the light of our need 
 For You are able always in all things 
 And in this moment we fall at Your feet 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 We lift a song in the light of our need 
 For You are able always in all things 
 And in this moment we fall at Your feet 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy 
 Lord have mercy

We want to see Your glory, 
 We want to know Your grace; 
 We want to feel Your presence, 
 We want to see Your face; 
 We humbly bow before You, 
 We listen for Your voice 
 And Lord, we welcome You into this place, (Echo) 
 Lord, we welcome You into this place, (Echo) 
 Lord, we welcome You into this place, (Echo) 
 Lord, we welcome You into this place (Echo) 
 (Repeat All) 
 And Lord, we welcome You into this place, (Echo) 
 Lord, we welcome You into this place, (Echo) 
 Lord, we welcome You into this place, (Echo) 
 Lord, we welcome You into this place (Echo)

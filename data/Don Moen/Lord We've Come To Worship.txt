Lord, we've come to worship 
 And we have come to pray 
 Lord, we've come to listen 
 And hear what you would say 
 Lord, our hearts are longing 
 To meet with you today 
 For we have come to seek you 
 And we have come to say 
 Worthy, you are worthy 
 King of kings, Lord of lords 
 You are worthy 
 All blessing and power 
 All riches and wisdom 
 All glory and honor and praise 
 To the Lamb 
 Lord, we need forgiveness 
 We're wandered far away 
 Look down in tender mercy 
 Forgive our sins we pray 
 O Lord, we need revival 
 All across this land 
 Come move among your people 
 With your mighty hand 
 Worthy, you are worthy 
 King of kings, Lord of lords 
 You are worthy 
 All blessing and power 
 All riches and wisdom 
 All glory and honor and praise 
 To the Lamb 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 To redeem us back to God again 
 To the Lamb 
 Who will reign 
 Forever and ever, amen 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 To redeem us back to God again 
 To the Lamb 
 Who will reign 
 Forever and ever, amen 
 Forever and ever 
 Forever and ever 
 Forever and ever 
 Forever and ever 
 Amen, amen, amen

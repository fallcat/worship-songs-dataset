Where would I be 
 If you had not been by my side 
 How could I rise to meet 
 The morning of the day 
 You tender mercy 
 Always calling from behind 
 At times I could not see you 
 Even though you were close by 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 Where would I be 
 If you had not been by my side 
 How could I rise to meet 
 The morning of the day 
 You tender mercy 
 Always calling from behind 
 At times I could not see you 
 Even though you were close by 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 Help me to see your lovingkindness 
 Help me to see you as you are 
 Help me to see your lovingkindness 
 Help me to see you as you are 
 As you really, really are 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 Lord You are good 
 You are good 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 And your mercy forever endures 
 And your mercy forever endures

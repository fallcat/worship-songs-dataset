Hear these praises from a grateful heart 
 Each time I think of You, the praises start 
 Love You so much, Jesus 
 Love You so much 
 Lord I love You, my soul sings 
 In Your presence, carried on Your wings 
 Love You so much, Jesus 
 Love You so much 
 How my soul longs for You 
 Longs to worship You forever 
 In Your power and majesty 
 Lift my hands, lift my heart 
 Lift my voice towards the heavens 
 For You are my sun and shield

If Your presence doesn't go with us 
 Lord we don't want to leave this place 
 Lord we need You near 
 As we go from here 
 To lead us by Your love and grace 
 May Your presence fill us every day 
 May Your Spirit lead the way 
 Lord to You we call 
 Let Your glory fall 
 And may Your presence go with us 
 If we have found favor in Your sight 
 Show us Your ways O Lord 
 'Cause we want to know You 
 And live in Your light 
 For all of our days 
 Show us Your ways 
 We have our hopes 
 And we have our dreams 
 But we cannot go 
 Where You will not lead 
 Lord to You we call 
 Let Your glory fall 
 And may Your presence go with us

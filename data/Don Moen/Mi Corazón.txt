My heart is filled with songs of praise 
 You gave me hope, You made a way 
 Now I long to live in your presence 
 For all of my days 
 My soul sings, my spirit shouts 
 With every breath I'm crying out 
 I want to live for You alone 
 You have captured my heart, Mi coraz√≥n 
 Amazing grace has rescued me 
 You paid the price, You set me free 
 I will sing Your praises forever 
 My Savior and King 
 I will give You glory 
 Tell the wondrous story 
 How You rescued me 
 I'm the guilty one 
 But You sacrificed Your Son 
 Your One and Only 
 Now I stand before You blameless and Holy

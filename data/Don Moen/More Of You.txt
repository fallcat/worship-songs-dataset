More Of You 
 More of You, and less of me; 
 Lord, I pray that there might be 
 More of You and less of me. 
 More of You, and less of me; 
 Lord, I pray that there might be 
 More of You and less of me. 
 Like a grain of wheat that falls to the earth, 
 And dies to live anew; 
 All my plans and earthly desires, 
 I lay them down to follow You.

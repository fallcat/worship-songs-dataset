More than anything 
 More than anything 
 I love You Jesus more than anything 
 More than worldly wealth 
 More than life itself 
 I love You Jesus more than anything. 
 Nothing in this world can take Your place 
 Nothing take Your love away 
 Someday I will see You face to face 
 Look into Your eyes and say 
 More than anything 
 More than anything 
 I love You Jesus more than anything 
 More than earthly friends 
 More than family 
 I love You Jesus more than anything.

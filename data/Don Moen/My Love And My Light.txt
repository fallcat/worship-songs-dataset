You are my love and my light 
 You are my purpose for living 
 You are my hope in the night 
 My reason for singing 
 You bring the joy to my life 
 (And You're) Making it better and better 
 And I will give thanks forever and ever 2x

 What we have been given 
 He has chosen us and called us His own 
 Flowing from His throne 
 There is a river 
 Bringing life and health wherever it goes 
 You are my love and my light 
 You are my purpose for living 
 You are my hope in the night 
 My reason for singing 
 You bring the joy to my life 
 (And You're) Making it better and better 
 And I will give thanks forever and ever

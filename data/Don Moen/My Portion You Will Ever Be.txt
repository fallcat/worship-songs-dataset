As long as the sun blazes and burns 
 Your mercies will never fail 
 As long as the seed time and harvest endure 
 Your mercies will never fail 
 And when my soul is downcast within 
 Your compassions have no end 
 Though the arrows pierce me 
 Though the darkness rages fiercely 
 You will be my strength 
 Though the earth gives way 
 My portion You will ever be 
 In fear or in faith 
 I'll say to my soul 
 Your mercies will never fail 
 A promise for ages 
 An anchor that holds 
 Your mercies will never fail 
 And when my soul is downcast within 
 Your compassions have no end 
 Though the arrows pierce me 
 Though the darkness rages fiercely 
 You will be my strength 
 Though the earth gives way 
 My portion You will ever be 
 It's all because of the Lord's great love 
 All because of the Lord's great love 
 It's all because of the Lord's great love 
 We are not consumed 
 It's all because of the Lord's great love 
 All because of the Lord's great love 
 It's all because of the Lord's great love 
 His mercies are ever new 
 Though the arrows pierce me 
 Though the darkness rages fiercely 
 You will be my strength 
 Though the earth gives way 
 My portion You will ever be 
 Though the arrows pierce me 
 Though the darkness rages fiercely 
 You will be my strength 
 Though the earth gives way 
 My portion You will ever be 
 My portion You will ever be

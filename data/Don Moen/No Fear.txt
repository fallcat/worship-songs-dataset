A thousand may fall even more at my side 
 There are rumors of war on the earth 
 The world may be shaking and flood waters rising 
 But I'll be standing firm on Your Word 
 When I am afraid I will put my hope in God 
 When I am dismayed 
 Even then I won't give up 
 You are my Strength 
 You are my Portion 
 When I go through the waters 
 I will have no fear 
 I will have no fear 
 You are my Shield 
 You are my Saving Light 
 When I go through the blazing fire 
 I will have no fear 
 In the midst of night when I can't see the light 
 And the shadows of the valley surround 
 I will walk on in faith 
 Holding onto Your Name 
 And letting go of all of my doubt 
 When I am afraid I will put my hope in God 
 When I am dismayed 
 Even then I won't give up 
 You are my Strength 
 You are my Portion 
 When I go through the waters 
 I will have no fear 
 I will have no fear 
 You are my Shield 
 You are my Saving Light 
 When I go through the blazing fire 
 I will have no fear 
 Oh I am not afraid no 
 Oh What can they do to me 
 Oh I am not afraid no 
 Why should I be 
 Why should I be 
 Oh I am not afraid no 
 Oh What can they do to me 
 Oh I am not afraid no 
 Why should I be 
 You are my Strength 
 You are my Portion 
 When I go through the waters 
 I will have no fear 
 I will have no fear 
 You are my Shield 
 You are my Saving Light 
 When I go through the blazing fire 
 I will have no fear

Now unto the king eternal 
 Unto the reigning King 
 Unto the Lord Almighty 
 Praises I will sing 
 To the King eternal 
 Sing to the King of kings 
 Sing to declare His glory 
 Let His praises ring 
 I will lift my hands 
 In joy before the King 
 I lift my hands in praise 
 I lif tmy heart in joyful jubilation 
 I lift my voice in praise 
 And I will shout "blessing" to the King 
 And I will shout "glory" to the King 
 And I will shout "honor" to the King 
 And I will shout "power" to the King 
 Declaring blessing and glory 
 And honor and power 
 Belong to Jesus the King of kings

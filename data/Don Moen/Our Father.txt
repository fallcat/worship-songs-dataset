Hear our prayer 
 We are your children and we're gathered here today 
 We're gathered here to pray 
 Hear our cry 
 Lord we need your mercy and we need you peace today 
 Hear us as we pray 
 Our Father, who art in heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name 
 Our Father hear us from heaven 
 Forgive our sins we pray 
 Hear our song, as it rises to heaven 
 May your glory fill the earth like waters in the seas 
 Clean our hearts and remove anything 
 That is standing in your way 
 Of loving us today! 
 And though we are few 
 We're sorrounded by many who have crossed that river before 
 And this is the song we'll be singing forever 
 Holy is the Lord x2 
 Repeat first verse and chorus

And when the sky was starless in the void of the night 
 (Our God is an awesome God) 
 He spoke into the darkness and created the light 
 (Our God is an awesome God) 
 The Judgment and wrath he poured out on Sodom 
 The Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross 
 I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 Our God (our God) is an awesome God 
 He reigns (He reigns) from heaven above 
 With wisdom (with wisdom) power and love 
 Our God is an awesome God

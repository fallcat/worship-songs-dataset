Our Heart our desire 
 Is to see the nations worship 
 Our cry our prayer 
 Is to sing your praise 
 To the ends of the earth 
 That with one mighty voice 
 Every tribe and toungue rejoices 
 Our Heart our disire 
 Is to see the nations worship You 
 Heavenly Father 
 Your mercy showers 
 Down upon all people 
 Every race upon this earth 
 May Your Spirit pierce the darkness 
 Break the chains of death upon us 
 Let us rise in honest worship 
 To declare Your matchless worth

There is no other name in heaven 
 There is no other name on the earth 
 By which we can be saved 
 There is no other way 
 So we worship, You, our king 
 And give You everything 
 There is none like You 
 Painter of the sky 
 Bright and morning star 
 Shine into our lives 
 There is none like You 
 Beginning and the end 
 All-consuming fire 
 Ignite our hearts again 
 There is no other love like Jesus 
 There is no other friend so true 
 No other hand of grace 
 No other hiding place 
 You're the Lamb of sacrifice 
 The glory of our lives 
 Rock of refuge, holy One 
 Your love has made us new 
 Through the ages kingdom come 
 We will worship You 
 We will worship You 
 All-consuming fire 
 Ignite our hearts again

When you lift your hands up high 
 And you sing a song of praise to me 
 It brings me great delight 
 Such a lovely sight 
 And yes it is true 
 Praise looks good on you 
 Morning night and noon 
 Your praise ascends to heaven like 
 The smell of sweet perfume 
 Filling every room 
 And yes it is true 
 Praise looks good on you 
 You bring your sacrifices 
 And you offer up your praise 
 You lift your voice with singing 
 But your heart seems far away 
 More than a sacrifice 
 I am looking for your life 
 Holy and acceptable 
 And pleasing in my sight 
 So offer up your lifes 
 Holy and acceptable 
 A willing sacrifice 
 Precious in my sight 
 But in all that you do 
 Remember all I want is you 
 So lift your hands up high 
 And worship him before the altar 
 Consecrate your life 
 A willing sacrifice 
 But in all that you do 
 Remeber all he want is you 
 And yes it is true 
 Praise looks good on you

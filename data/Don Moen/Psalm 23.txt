Jesus my shepherd and only provider 
 He makes me lie down in green pastures 
 He leads me beside the still water 
 He restores my soul 
 Surely goodness and mercy will follow me 
 All the days of my life 
 And I will dwell in His house forever 
 Until the end of time 
 Jesus my Shepherd and only provider 
 You make me lie down in green pastures 
 You lead me beside the still water 
 You restore my soul 
 Though I walk through the valley of shadows 
 I will not be afraid 
 Your rod and staff are my only comfort 
 And You'll be with me always 
 You prepare a table before me 
 In the presence of my enemies 
 And You anoint my head with oil 
 And my cup overflows 
 My cup overflows with Your love 
 With Your love 
 Jesus my shepherd and only provider 
 You make me lie down in green pastures 
 You lead me beside the still water 
 You restore my soul

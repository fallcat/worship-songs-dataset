So I gladly bow my knees before my King 
 Offering all I have to give is what I bring 
 Jesus You are greater than this world of sin 
 You have made a way for me to enter in 
 All honor 
 All glory 
 To the Lamb of God Jesus 
 We live for You Savior 
 You come to ransom us 
 You ransom us 
 When I pass through waters deep I will not fear 
 When I'm walking through the fire You will be near 
 Jesus You deliver with Your mighty hand 
 I will give You praise in every circumstance 
 All honor 
 All glory 
 To the Lamb of God Jesus 
 We live for You Savior 
 You come to ransom us 
 All honor 
 All glory 
 To the Lamb of God Jesus 
 We live for You Savior 
 You come to ransom us 
 You ransomed us 
 You ransomed us 
 You ransomed us 
 You ransomed us 
 All honor 
 All glory 
 To the Lamb of God

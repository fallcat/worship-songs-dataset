You are the source of life 
 I can't be left behind 
 No one else will do 
 I will take hold of you 
 'Cause I need you Jesus 
 To come to me rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name 
 By which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 I will follow you 
 I will follow you 
 My heart is your for life 
 I need your hand in mine 
 No one else will do 
 I put my trust in you 
 'Cause I need you Jesus 
 To come to me rescue 
 Tell me Where else can I go 
 There's no other name 
 By which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 I will follow you 
 I will follow you 
 I will fallow you 
 This world has nothing for me 
 This world has nothing for me 
 This world has nothing for me 
 This world has nothing for me 
 'Cause I need you Jesus 
 To come to me rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name 
 By which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 I will fallow you 
 I will trust in you 
 This world has nothing for me 
 I will trust in you 
 This world has nothing for me 
 I will fallow you

Thirsty for more you 
 More of your Spirit and truth 
 Wash me from all my sin 
 Fill me with your Spirit again 
 You're the river of love 
 Flowing with the grace and mercy 
 Flooding my soul 
 Filling my heart with peace 
 O river of love 
 Like streams in the desert 
 Giver of life 
 Giving your life and love 
 To set me free 
 Heal me and I'll be healed 
 Save me and I will be saved 
 You've filled me with songs of praise 
 Forever I will sing of your grace 
 You're the river of love 
 Flowing with the grace and mercy 
 Flooding my soul 
 Filling my heart with peace 
 O river of love 
 Like streams in the desert 
 Giver of life 
 Giving your life and love 
 To set me free 
 If anyone is thirsty let him come on in 
 When you drink the living water 
 You will never thirst again 
 You're the river of love 
 Flowing with the grace and mercy 
 Flooding my soul 
 Filling my heart with peace 
 O river of love 
 Like streams in the desert 
 Giver of life 
 Giving your life and love 
 You're the river of love 
 Flowing with the grace and mercy 
 Flooding my soul 
 Filling my heart with peace 
 O river of love 
 Like streams in the desert 
 Giver of life 
 Giving your life and love 
 To set me free 
 Giving your life and love 
 To set me free 
 Giving your life and love 
 To set me free

How can I say thanks 
 For everything You've done 
 And how can I give praise 
 Lord You've given me so much 
 You gave it all 
 You paid the price 
 Now I want to give You my life 
 As a sacrifice of praise 
 O lift it up to You 
 Lord I give my heart away 
 O I give it all to you 
 Lord make my life an offering 
 Let me worship You in everything I do 
 A sacrifice of praise I give to You 
 In sunshine and in rain 
 In sorrow and in pain 
 Lord I will give You praise 
 And choose to bless Your name 
 You gave it all 
 And You paid the price 
 Now I want to give You my life 
 As a sacrifice of praise 
 O lift it up to You 
 Lord I give my heart away 
 O I give it all to you 
 Lord make my life an offering 
 Let me worship You in everything I do 
 A sacrifice of praise I give to You 
 Lord I want to lift You up (X3) 
 As a sacrifice of praise 
 O lift it up to You 
 Lord I give my heart away 
 O I give it all to you 
 Lord make my life an offering 
 Let me worship You in everything I do 
 A sacrifice of praise I give to You (X3) 
 Lord I want to lift You up (X2)

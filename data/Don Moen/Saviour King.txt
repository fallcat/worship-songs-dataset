Let now the weak say I have strength 
 By the Spirit of pow'r 
 That raised Christ from the dead 
 Let now the poor stand and confess 
 That my portion in Him 
 And I'm more then blessed 
 Let now our hearts burn with a flame 
 A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name 
 And with the heavens we declare 
 You are our King 
 We love You, Lord 
 We Worship You 
 You are our God 
 You alone are good 
 Let now Your church shine as your bride 
 That You saw in Your heart 
 As You offered up Your life 
 Let now the lost be welcome home 
 By the saved and redeemed 
 Those adopted as Your own 
 Let now our hearts burn with a flame 
 A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name 
 And with the heavens we declare 
 You are our King 
 You asked Your Son to carry this 
 The heavy cross 
 Our weight of sin 
 I love You, Lord 
 I Wwrship You 
 Hope which was lost, now stands renewed 
 I give my life to honor this 
 The love of Christ 
 The Saviour King 
 You asked Your Son to carry this 
 The heavy cross 
 Our weight of sin 
 I love You, Lord 
 I worship You 
 Hope which was lost now stands renewed 
 I give my life to honor this 
 The love of Christ 
 The Saviour King

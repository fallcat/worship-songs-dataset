Sing for joy to God our strength 
 Sing for joy to God our strength, our strength 
 If we call to Him, He will answer us 
 If we run to Him, He will run to us 
 If we lift our hands, He will lift us up 
 Come now praise his name, all you saints of God. 
 Draw near to Him, he is here with us 
 Give Him your love, He's in love with us 
 He will heal our hearts, He will cleanse our hands 
 If we rend our hearts He will heal our land.

I was lost in a desert land 
 So dry and thirsty 
 But God was there where He'd always been 
 Giving grace and mercy 
 So hard to sing and hard to pray 
 Yet I knew His Word was true 
 And then one day my faith returned 
 And suddenly I knew 
 Somebody's praying for me 
 Somebody's knocking on Heaven's door 
 Somebody's praying for me 
 Somebody's lifting me up to the Lord 
 I knew it had to be 
 Somebody down on their knees 
 Somebody praying for me 
 I've been spared by so many prayers 
 How many times I could not say 
 What a difference a prayer can make 
 When it's offered up in faith 
 God has always made a way 
 When I didn't know what to do 
 Just when I needed a miracle 
 That's when your prayers broke through 
 Somebody's praying for me 
 Somebody's knocking on Heaven's door 
 Somebody's praying for me 
 Somebody's lifting me up to the Lord 
 Well I knew it had to be 
 Somebody down on their knees 
 Somebody praying for me 
 Now I know that friend was you 
 You were the gift God gave me 
 'Cause when you prayed His love broke through 
 It was your prayer that saved me 
 Thank you for praying for me 
 Thank you for knocking on Heaven's door 
 Thank you for praying for me 
 Thank you for lifting me up to the Lord 
 Now I can clearly see 
 That you were the one on your knees 
 So thank you for praying for me 
 Somebody's praying for me 
 Somebody's knocking on Heaven's door 
 Somebody's praying for me 
 Somebody's lifting me up to the Lord 
 Well I knew it had to be 
 Somebody down on their knees 
 Somebody praying for me

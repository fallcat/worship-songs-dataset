Hide me now, under Your wings 
 Cover me, within Your mighty hand 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with You, above the storm 
 Father, You are King over the flood 
 I will be still, know You are God 
 Find rest my soul, in Christ alone 
 Know His power, in quietness and trust 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with You, above the storm 
 Father, You are King over the flood 
 I will be still, know You are God 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with You, above the storm 
 Father, You are King over the flood 
 I will be still, know You are God 
 Find rest my soul, in Christ alone 
 Know His power, in quietness and trust 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with You, above the storm 
 Father, You are King over the flood 
 I will be still, know You are God 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with You, above the storm 
 Father, You are King over the flood 
 I will be still, know You are God 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with You, above the storm 
 Father, You are King over the flood 
 I will be still, know You are God

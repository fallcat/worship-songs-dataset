I was walking down a dead-end road 
 Carrying such a heavy load 
 But You lifted me with a mighty hand 
 And You taught feet just how to dance 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Hey, I'm free to run again 
 Free to throw away these chains 
 Thank God I'm free 
 I'm free to live again 
 Never holding back again 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Every sorrow You replace with joy 
 I have every reason to rejoice 
 You broke the walls that held me in 
 Now I can shout and I can sing 
 I just can't go back to where I've been 
 Living captive to the fear of men 
 I will not give up, I won't give in 
 I'm holding nothing back 
 I'm holding on to You 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Hey I'm free to run again 
 Free to throw away these chains 
 Thank God I'm free 
 I'm free to live again 
 Never holding back again 
 Thank God I'm free 
 I'm free to run again 
 Free to throw away these chains 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Hey, I'm free to live again 
 Never holding back again 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Thank God I'm free 
 I'm free

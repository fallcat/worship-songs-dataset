In the darkest night 
 When I couldn't see 
 I was sinkin' fast 
 When You rescued me 
 I felt a hand 
 And there You were 
 Nowhere else to turn 
 I was all alone 
 Kinda' lost my way 
 All my dreams were gone 
 Then I heard a voice 
 And there You were 
 I needed a touch from the Savior's hand 
 And that's just how the miracle began 
 I know I'll never be the same again 
 All I can say is 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Lord 
 When I think about 
 All You've done for me 
 Took away my fear 
 Filled my heart with peace 
 I'm grateful Lord 
 There You were 
 From this moment on 
 Till my final breath 
 Lord I'll worship You 
 And remember this 
 Through every storm 
 There You were 
 I needed a touch from the Savior's hand 
 And that's just how the miracle began 
 I know I'll never be the same again 
 All I can say is 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Lord 
 I believe that Jesus knows all about our struggles 
 He will guide till the day is done 
 Jesus knows all about our struggles 
 He will guide till the day is done 
 There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus 
 No not one 
 No not one 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Lord 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Lord 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Thank You Lord

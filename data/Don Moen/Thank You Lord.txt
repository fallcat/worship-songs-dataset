I come before you today, 
 And there's just one thing that I want to say; 
 Thank you, Lord 
 For all You've given to me, for all the blessing that 
 I cannot see 
 Thank you, Lord; 
 Bridge/Pre-Chorus 
 With a grateful heart, with a song of praise, 
 With an outstretched arm, I will bless your name. 
 Thank you, Lord, I just want to thank you Lord, 
 Thank you, Lord, I just want to thank you Lord; Thank 
 You, Lord. 
 For all you've done in my life, 
 You took my darkness and gave me your light 
 Thank you, Lord 
 You took my sin and my shame, 
 You took my sickness and healed all my pain 
 Thank you, Lord 
 Bridge/Pre-Chorus

The Earth shakes at the sound of His voice 
 The nations tremble before Him 
 The idols of men are all falling 
 At the feet of the LORD our God 
 At the feet of the LORD our God 
 The Lord is warrior; fearless is He 
 The Lord is mighty in battle 
 His armies outnumber His enemies 
 When they shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down! 
 And Babylon is falling, falling down! 
 The Lord is a Saviour; gracious is He 
 The Lord is full of compassion 
 His army is also His family 
 When they shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down! 
 And Babylon is falling, falling down! 
 The Lord has a kingdom; Jesus is King 
 He reigns forever and ever! 
 He's given us power and authority 
 When we shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down! 
 And Babylon is falling, falling down! 
 The Earth shakes at the sound of His voice 
 The nations tremble before Him 
 The idols of men are all falling 
 At the feet of the LORD our God 
 At the feet of the LORD our God

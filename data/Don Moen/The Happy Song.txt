Well I could sing unending songs 
 Of how you saved my soul 
 And I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of your great love 
 Well I could sing unending songs 
 Of how you saved my soul 
 And I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of your great love 
 My heart is bursting Lord 
 To tell of all you've done 
 Of how've you changed my life 
 And wiped away the past 
 I want to shout it out 
 From every roof top sing 
 For now I know 
 My God is for me, not against me 
 I could sing unending songs 
 Of how you saved my soul 
 Well, I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of your great love 
 My heart is bursting Lord 
 To tell of all you've done 
 Of how've you changed my life 
 And wiped away the past 
 Well I'll always shout it out 
 From every roof top sing 
 For now I know 
 My God is for me, not against me 
 I could sing unending songs 
 Of how you saved my soul 
 Well, I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of your great love 
 Everybody's singin' now 
 'Cause we're so happy 
 Yeah, 
 Everybody's dancin' now 
 'Cause we're so free 
 If only we could see His face, 
 See you smiling over us 
 And unseen angels celebrate 
 'Cause joy is in this place 
 'Cause joy is in this place 
 I could sing unending songs 
 Of how you've saved my soul 
 And I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of your great love 
 And I could sing unending songs 
 Of how you've saved my soul 
 And I could dance a thousand miles 
 Because of your great love

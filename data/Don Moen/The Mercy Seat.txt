In the darkness, where ev'rything is unknown, 
 I faced the power of sin on my own. 
 I did not know of the place I could go, 
 Where I could find a way to heal my wounded soul. 
 He said that I could come into His presence without fear, 
 Into the holy place where His mercy hovers near. 
 I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the mercy seat 
 Where Jesus is calling. 
 His grace will be my covering, 
 His blood will flow freely, it will provide my healing. 
 I'm running to the mercy seat. 
 Are you living where hope has not been? 
 Lost in the curse of a lifetime of sin? 
 Lovely illusions, they never come true, 
 But I know where there's a place of mercy for you. 
 He said that you could come into His presence without fear, 
 Into the holy place where His mercy hovers near. 
 Come running, come running, come running to the mercy seat 
 Where Jesus is calling, 
 His grace will be your covering. 
 His blood will flow freely, 
 It will provide your healing. 
 Come running to the mercy seat. 
 He said that I could come into His presence without fear, 
 Into the holy place where His mercy hovers near. 
 I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the mercy seat 
 Where Jesus is calling, 
 His grace will be my covering. 
 His blood will flow freely, 
 It will provide my healing. 
 I'm running to the mercy seat. 
 I'm running to the mercy seat. 
 Come running to the mercy seat. 
 I'm running to the mercy seat.

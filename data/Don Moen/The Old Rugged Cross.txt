On a hill far away, stood an old rugged Cross 
 The emblem of suff'ring and shame 
 And I love that old Cross where the dearest and best 
 For a world of lost sinners was slain 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged Cross 
 Till my trophies at last I lay down 
 I will cling to the old rugged Cross 
 And exchange it some day for a crown 
 Oh, that old rugged Cross so despised by the world 
 Has a wondrous attraction for me 
 For the dear Lamb of God, left his Glory above 
 To bear it to dark Calvary 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged Cross 
 Till my trophies at last I lay down 
 I will cling to the old rugged Cross 
 And exchange it some day for a crown 
 In the old rugged Cross, stain'd with blood so divine 
 A wondrous beauty I see 
 For the dear Lamb of God, left his Glory above 
 To pardon and sanctify me 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged Cross 
 Till my trophies at last I lay down 
 I will cling to the old rugged Cross 
 And exchange it some day for a crown 
 To the old rugged Cross, I will ever be true 
 Its shame and reproach gladly bear 
 Then He'll call me some day to my home far away 
 Where his glory forever I'll share 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged Cross 
 Till my trophies at last I lay down 
 I will cling to the old rugged Cross 
 And exchange it some day for a crown

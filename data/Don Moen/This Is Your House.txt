As we gather in this place today 
 Holy Spirit come and have Your way, have Your way 
 As we lay aside our own desires 
 Sweep across our hearts with holy fire, have Your way 
 This is Your house, Your home 
 We welcome You, Lord, we welcome You 
 This is Your house, Your home 
 We welcome You today 
 As we offer up our hearts and lives 
 Let them be a living sacrifice, have Your way 
 Be glorified in everything we do 
 Be glorified in everything we say, have Your way 
 Coda: 
 As we praise, o Lord draw near 
 It's Your voice, we long to hear 
 (Repeat Chorus twice) 
 Ending: 
 We welcome You today 
 We welcome You today

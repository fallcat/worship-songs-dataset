Jesus, we lift you on our praises 
 So every eye can see your face your power and grace 
 Behold you as you really are 
 Brighter than all the stars of heaven 
 Our worship is for you alone 
 We build you this throne of praise 
 As long as I have breath 
 I'll find a way to say that I love you 
 Every thing may change and the world may pass away 
 I'll still Love you 
 With every song we sing 
 Every prayer we pray 
 We'll build you a throne 
 Made from the sound of praise 
 Jesus, we lift you on our praises 
 So every eye can see Your face Your power and grace 
 Behold You as You really are 
 Brighter than all the stars of heaven 
 Our worship is for You alone 
 We build You this throne of praise 
 You O Lord deserve the praise of all earth 
 And we worship You 
 A Sacrifice you died now great and glorified 
 And we worship You 
 With every song we sing 
 Every prayer we pray 
 We'll build you a throne 
 Made from the sound of praise 
 Jesus, we lift you on our praises 
 So every eye can see Your face Your power and grace 
 Behold You as You really are 
 Brighter than all the stars of heaven 
 Our worship is for You alone 
 We build You this throne of praise

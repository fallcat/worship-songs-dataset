What can I give 
 What can I bring 
 That would be pleasing to my King 
 I'll give my heart not just a part 
 I'm lifting up my everything 
 Well it's all I have to offer 
 And it's all I have to give 
 Two hands one heart 
 One life to offer You 
 Two hands one heart 
 That's what I give to You 
 Use me today I know You can 
 Lord I surrender to You plan 
 Well You made this heart 
 You made these hands 
 Take me and use me as I am 
 Well it's all I have to offer 
 And it's all I have to give 
 Little becomes a lot 
 When it's in Your hands 
 Take me and make me more like You 
 Well it may not seem like much 
 But with the Master's touch 
 I know that I'll be more like You 
 That's what I give to You

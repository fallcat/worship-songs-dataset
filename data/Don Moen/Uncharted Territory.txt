I find myself in uncharted territory 
 Never felt so lost 
 Never felt so lonely 
 Where are You Lord 
 I'm so afraid 
 I can feel the fear inside me 
 Can't control the chaos all around me 
 Where are You Lord 
 How can I sing the Lord's song in a foreign land? 
 (But) How can I forget 
 All You've done for me 
 Everything You've done Lord 
 Just to set me free 
 Teach me how to pray 
 Teach me how to praise 
 Even in the darkness 
 Teach me how to sing Your song 
 How can I sing 
 When my heart is broken 
 When every prayer is just a token 
 Where are You Lord 
 Sometimes our pain can tell a tragic story 
 Still I will praise You 
 And give You glory 
 Where are You Lord 
 Help me to sing the Lord's song in this foreign land 
 (But) How can I forget 
 All You've done for me 
 Everything You've done Lord 
 Just to set me free 
 Teach me how to pray 
 Teach me how to praise 
 Even in the darkness 
 Teach me how to sing Your song 
 Your song 
 Gonna sing Your song 
 (But) How can I forget 
 All You've done for me 
 You have been so faithful 
 Meeting every need 
 Teach me how to pray 
 Teach me how to praise 
 Even in the darkness 
 Teach me how to sing Your song 
 Your song 
 Gonna sing Your song

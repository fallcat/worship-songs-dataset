Unto the King 
 Eternal Immortal 
 Invisible 
 The only wise God 
 Be honour and glory forever and ever 
 Be honour and glory forevermore 
 Honour and glory and power and might 
 Be unto Jesus the King 
 Honour and glory and power and might 
 Be unto Jesus the King 
 Be all the honour (Forever and ever) 
 Be all the glory (Forever and ever) 
 All adoration (Forever and ever) 
 And all of the praises (Forever and evermore)

Talking 
 Lord, we are here for one purpose tonight 
 To bless Your name, to give glory 
 Honor and praises 
 To give You everything we are, Hallelujah 
 We're here to bless Your name 
 Gathered as Your family 
 To praise You and proclaim 
 Your faithfulness and mercy 
 We give You glory, we give You honor 
 We give you everything we are 
 Lifting our hearts and hands before You 
 We give You glory, we give You honor 
 We give you everything we are 
 Lifting our hearts and hands before You 
 Oh yes, we do 
 We're here to seek Your face 
 Together in Your presence 
 To celebrate Your grace 
 To praise You for Your mercies 
 We give You glory, we give You honor 
 We give you everything we are 
 Lifting our hearts and hands before You 
 We give You glory, we give You honor 
 We give you everything we are 
 Lifting our hearts and hands before You 
 Yes, we do 
 (Come one) 
 There is no other reason why we came 
 Than to glorify Your name 
 For You are worthy to be praise 
 Now we offer up our lives 
 As a willing sacrifice 
 Holy, acceptable to You 
 We give You glory, we give You honor 
 We give you everything we are 
 Lifting our hearts and hands before You 
 We give You glory, we give You honor 
 We give you everything we are 
 Lifting our hearts and hands before You

We wait 
 We're not in a hurry 
 O we need you, Lord 
 We wait 
 All our cares and worries 
 We lay aside for you 
 O how we long to see your face 
 O how we long for your embrace 
 We wait 
 We're not afraid to tarry 
 We yearn for you, Lord 
 We wait 
 For your mighty wind to carry us 
 Into your presence, Lord 
 And as we fill this house with praise 
 May your holy fire fill this place 
 As we wait... 
 We wait... we wait... we wait... 
 And as we fill this house with praise 
 Let your holy fire fill this place 
 As we wait... as we wait... as we wait... 
 We wait... as we wait... we wait... 
 As we wait... we wait... as we wait

When it's all been said and done 
 There is just one thing that matters 
 Did I do my best to live for truth? 
 Did I live my life for you? 
 When it's all been said and done 
 All my treasures will mean nothing 
 Only what I have done 
 For love's rewards 
 Will stand the test of time 
 Lord, your mercy is so great 
 That you look beyond our weakness 
 And find purest gold in miry clay 
 Turning sinners into saints 
 I will always sing your praise 
 Here on earth and heaven after 
 For you've joined me at my true home 
 When it's all been said and done 
 You're my life when life is gone...

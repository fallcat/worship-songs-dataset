With a thankful heart 
 And a song of praise 
 We've come to You 
 Gathered in this place 
 For the things You've done 
 And for who You are 
 We worship You 
 With a thankful heart 
 So we lift up our praise 
 And we lift up out sacrifice to You 
 Lord we offer our prayers 
 And we offer our lives in gratitude 
 For all You do 
 We worship You 
 With a thankful heart 
 With a thankful heart 
 We will give You praise 
 You've been so good 
 Covered us with grace 
 You have been our strength 
 In a time so dark 
 So we worship You 
 With a thankful heart

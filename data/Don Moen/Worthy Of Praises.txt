Lift up your hands O ye gates 
 Be lifted up ancient doors 
 People of God open your hearts 
 Bow down and worship the Lord 
 He is the Lord strong and mighty 
 He is the head over all 
 Holy, Almighty God He is holy, holy 
 Worthy, He is exalted and worthy 
 Worthy of praises 
 All nations come, worship the Lamb 
 Join in the heavenly song 
 For He was slain and with His blood 
 He has redeemed us to God 
 He is the Lord strong and mighty 
 He is the head over all 
 Holy, Almighty God He is holy, holy 
 Worthy, He is exalted and worthy 
 Worthy of praises 
 Worthy the Lamb who was slain 
 Worthy of power and riches 
 And honor and praise 
 Holy, Almighty God He is holy, holy 
 Worthy, He is exalted and worthy 
 Worthy of praises 
 Holy, Almighty God He is holy, holy 
 Worthy, He is exalted and worthy 
 Worthy of praises 
 Holy, worthy, holy, worthy, holy...

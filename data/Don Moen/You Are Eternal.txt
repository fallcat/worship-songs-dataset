You are Eternal unchanging 
 Your love forever 
 Will be unfailing 
 I can see 
 You have a covenant with me 
 You are eternal 
 Forever You will be my God 
 You are eternal unchanging 
 Your thoughts 
 And marvelous ways 
 Amazing to me 
 You will provide 
 For every need 
 You are eternal 
 Forever you will be my God 
 You will ever be the same 
 You are a God 
 Who cannot change 
 And You have promissed 
 You'll never forsake us 
 You have called us 
 By Your name 
 You are eternal unchanging 
 And there is no shadow 
 Of turning with You 
 O it's true 
 I have a covenant with You 
 You are eternal 
 Forever You will be my God

You are here in our midst. 
 How we've waited for moments like this. 
 Have Your way in this place. 
 Holy Spirit come do as you wish. 
 We are changed as You move in our midst. 
 You are here among us for we have gathered in Your Name. 
 We can feel Your presence in this place. 
 You are here among us. 
 You are enthroned upon Your praise. 
 You are here, here to heal and here to save. 
 You are here in our midst. 
 How we've waited for moments like this. 
 Have Your way in this place. 
 Holy Spirit come do as you wish. 
 We are changed as You move in our midst.

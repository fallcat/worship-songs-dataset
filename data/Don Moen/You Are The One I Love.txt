Nobody else could change my heart 
 Nobody else could save me 
 Picked up the pieces when I fell apart 
 I'm so glad you're unchanging 
 Yes You are the one that I love 
 Light of the world descend from above 
 Sing hallelujah 
 Shout to the Lord 
 You are the one 
 You are the one 
 I love 
 If I knew this song that the angels sang 
 We will be singing together 
 'Cause I can't wait for eternity 
 Praising Your name forever

You Make Me Lie Down In Green Pastures 
 Don Moen 
 You make me lie down 
 In green pastures 
 You make me wanting for nothing 
 You fill my hunger 
 With honey from your sweet sweet word 
 You let me worship before you 
 So I will love you and adore you 
 You are my Shepherd 
 You are my Jesus 
 You are my Lord

You said "Ask and you will receive" 
 Whatever you need 
 You Said "Pray and I'll hear from heaven and I'll heal your land" 
 You said, Your glory will fill the earth like water to seas 
 You said "Lift up your eyes the harvest is here the kingdom is near" 
 You said ask and I'll give the nations to you 
 Oh Lord, that's the cry of my heart 
 Distant shores and the islands will see your light 
 As it rises on us

 Oh Lord, that's the cry of my heart 
 Distant shores and the islands will see your light

 Ask and I'll give the nations to you 
 Oh Lord, that's the cry of my heart 
 Distant shores and the islands will see your light 
 As it rises on earth

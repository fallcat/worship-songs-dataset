You know my needs 
 All that's unspoken 
 You hold the pieces 
 Of all that's been broken 
 Even when a melody won't come 
 Even when my words are not enough 
 You will be my song 
 You will be my praise 
 You will be my voice 
 When I'm lost for words to say 
 You will be my strength 
 You will lift me up 
 You will be my portion 
 And my everlasting love 
 You will be my song 
 Before I call 
 I know You'll hear me 
 When hope is gone 
 Still You are near me 
 Even when the answer is delayed 
 Even through the darkness I will say 
 You will be my song 
 You will be my praise 
 You will be my voice 
 When I'm lost for words to say 
 You will be my strength 
 You will lift me up 
 You will be my portion 
 And my everlasting love 
 You will be my song 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Even when I feel like I'm alone 
 I know You'll never leave me on my own 
 You will be my song 
 You will be my praise 
 You will be my voice 
 When I'm lost for words to say 
 You will be my strength 
 You will lift me up 
 You will be my portion 
 And my everlasting love 
 You will be my song 
 You will be my praise 
 You will be my voice 
 When I'm lost for words to say 
 You will be my strength 
 You will lift me up 
 You will be my portion 
 And my everlasting love 
 You will be my song

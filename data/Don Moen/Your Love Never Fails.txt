Nothing can separate 
 Even if I ran away 
 Your love never fails 
 I know I still make mistakes 
 But You have new mercies for me everyday 
 Your love never fails 
 You stay the same through the ages 
 Your love never changes 
 There may be pain in the night 
 But joy comes in the morning 
 And when the oceans rage 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 Because I know that You love me 
 Your love never fails 
 The wind is strong and the water's deep 
 But I'm not alone here in these open seas 
 Your love never fails 
 The chasm is far too wide 
 I never thought I'd reach the other side 
 Your love never fails 
 You stay the same through the ages 
 Your love never changes 
 There may be pain in the night 
 But joy comes in the morning 
 And when the oceans rage 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 Because I know that You love me 
 Your love never fails 
 You make all things work together for my good 
 You make all things work together for my good 
 You make all things work together for my good 
 You make all things work together for my good 
 You make all things work together for my good 
 You make all things work together for my good 
 You stay the same through the ages 
 Your love never changes 
 There may be pain in the night 
 But joy comes in the morning 
 And when the oceans rage 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 Because I know that You love me 
 Your love never fails 
 Because I know that You love me 
 Your love never fails

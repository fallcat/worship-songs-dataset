Your steadfast love extends to the heavens 
 Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds 
 Your righteousness is like majestic mountains 
 And your wisdom like the depths of the sea 
 And you come to me 
 Filling my heat with your loving kindness 
 I find my peace in the shadow of your wings 
 I eat my fill from the abundance of your household 
 And I drink from the streams of rejoicing 
 You are my king 
 You are my king 
 You are my king 
 You are my king

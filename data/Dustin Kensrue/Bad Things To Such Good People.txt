My jail shoes on 
 The well kept cemetery lawn 
 Both of them weeping 
 Their one good son now was gone 
 The irony to see my dad down on his knees 
 Crying out to Jesus 
 But lord I've always done what's right 
 And all the while 
 The good lord smiled 
 And looked the other way 
 (And looked the other way) 
 When we were kids 
 I did my best to make them proud 
 It just wasn't in me 
 I could not fly straight to save my life 
 And all the while 
 The good lord smiled 
 And looked the other way 
 (And looked the other way) 
 Their big success is now their biggest failure 
 Their golden child has been dethroned 
 Their reputation is now in ruins 
 Their tower to heaven has come tumbling down 
 And all the while 
 The good lord smiles 
 And looks the other way 
 (And looks the other way)

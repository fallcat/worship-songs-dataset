Once upon a time, I had a little money. 
 Government burglars took it long 
 Before I could mail it to you, but 
 You are the only one. 
 Now I can't let it slip away. 
 So if the man with the ticker tape, 
 Tries to take it, 
 This is what I'm gonna say. 
 Blame it on Cain. 
 Don't blame it on me. 
 Oh, oh, it's nobody's fault, 
 But we need somebody to burn 
 Well, if I was a saint with 
 A silver cup 
 And the money got low 
 We could always heat it up 
 Or trade it in 
 But then the radio to heaven will be wired to your purse 
 Then you can run down the wave band, 
 Coast to coast, hand in hand 
 Better or worse, curse for curse, 
 Don't be dissatisfied 
 So you're not satisfied 
 I think I've lived a little too long 
 On the outskirts of town 
 I think I'm going insane 
 From talking to myself for so long 
 Oh but I've never been accused 
 But when they step up on your face, 
 They wear that good look grin 
 I gotta break out one weekend 
 Try to do somebody in 
 But every single time 
 I feel a little stronger, 
 They tell me it's a crime 
 Well how much longer? 
 Blame it on Cain 
 Please don't blame it on me 
 It's nobodies fault 
 But it just seems to be his turn

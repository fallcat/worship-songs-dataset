I've got a feeling, it's hard to explain. 
 Feels like the devil rents a room in my brain. 
 Did things I'm ashamed of, feel like dear old St. Paul. 
 The things that I wanna do, I don't do at all. 
 So bury me deep, 
 Cover me with snow. 
 Wrap me in sleep, 
 The blanket of ghosts. 
 The spirit is willing, but the flesh is so weak. 
 I wanna kiss your lips, but I kiss your cheek. 
 Hear my request, in this one unfair way: 
 Please take me home, before it's too late. 
 Bury me deep, 
 And cover me with snow. 
 Wrap me in sleep, 
 The blanket of ghosts. 
 Wake me when it's spring time in Heaven, 
 The tears are all wiped from my face. 
 Wake me when it's spring time in Heaven, 
 When I'm strong enough to walk in that Place. 
 So bury me deep, 
 And cover me with snow. 
 And wrap me in sleep, 
 The blanket of ghosts. 
 Wake me when it's spring time in Heaven, 
 When the tears are all wiped from my face. 
 Wake me when it's spring time in Heaven, 
 When I'm strong enough to walk in that Place.

I've been with Sally and I've been with Sue 
 I've been with Cindy and her sister too 
 Now I'm trying to settle down 
 Start a family with that cute little Kim 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood 
 Now this wine seems too thin 
 I've got a needle, don't be alarmed 
 It shoots streams of lovely things into my arm 
 Well, I'd sell my own mother for that sweet heroin 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood 
 Now this wine seems too thin 
 Sometimes the white coats, they hide black hearts 
 We've learned to sugarcoat the same blackguards 
 Well, I turn lead into gold 
 I cure original sin 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood 
 Now this wine seems too thin 
 Oh, well, I walked in the bank 
 And I pulled out my gun 
 You should've seen those people scream and run 
 I used to make an honest buck 
 How can I go back to that again? 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood 
 Now this wine seems too thin 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood 
 Now this wine seems too thin 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood 
 Now this wine seems too thin

I've been with Sally 
 I've been with Sue 
 I've been with Cindy and her sister too. 
 Now I'm tryin' to settle down, 
 Start a family wiith that cute little Kim. 
 But now that I've tasted blood, 
 Now this wine tastes too thin. 
 I've got a needle, don't be alarmed. 
 It shoots streams of lovely things into my arm. 
 Well I'd sell my own mother for that sweet heroin. 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood, 
 Now this wine seems too thin. 
 Sometimes the white coats; They hide black hearts. 
 We've learned to sugar coat the same black guards. 
 Well, I turn lead into gold 
 I'll cure original sin. 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood, 
 Now this wine seems too thin. 
 Oh, well I walked in the bank 
 And I pulled out my gun. 
 You should've seen those people scream and run. 
 I used to make an honest buck; 
 How can I go back to that again? 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood, 
 Now this wine seems too thin. 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood, 
 Now this wine seems too thin. 
 Oh, now that I've tasted blood, 
 Now this weein seems too thin

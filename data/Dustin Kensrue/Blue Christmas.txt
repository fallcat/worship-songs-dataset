I'll have a blue Christmas without you. 
 I'll be so blue just thinking about you. 
 Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree 
 Won't mean a thing, Dear, if you're not here with me. 
 When those blue snowflakes start falling, 
 That's when those blue memories start calling. 
 You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white, 
 But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas. 
 You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white, 
 But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas. 
 Yes, I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

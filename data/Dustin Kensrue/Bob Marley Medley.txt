Baby, I really wanna know 
 I think you should stop your cryin' 
 Here my kerchief to dry your eyes 
 You know that I love you, 
 Groovy; here I am: 
 Come rub it 'pon me belly 
 Like some guava jelly. 
 Damsel, here I am: 
 Come rub upon my belly 
 Like some guava jelly. 
 This train is bound for glory - this train; 
 Yeah I'm Talkin' 'bout this train is bound for glory - this train: 
 This train is bound for glory, 
 This train will carry no un'oly; 
 Cause the stone that the builder refuse 
 Should always be the head cornerstone-a; 
 The stone that the builder refuse 
 Should always be the head cornerstone. 
 You're a builder, baby; 
 Here I am, a stone. 
 To confuse you girl 
 The things we refuse 
 Are the things we should choose 
 Can you hear me? 
 Oh, hear what I say 
 And this train is bound for glory - this train; 
 Yeah I'm Talkin' 'bout this train is bound for glory - this train: 
 This train is bound for glory, 
 Oh, this train will carry no un'oly; 
 'Cause I, just can't be sad

When all we have are rags and bones 
 Just hold my hand and don't let go 
 'Cause though the night is cold, we'll carry the fire 
 And though there's no way home, we'll carry the fire 
 When the husks of men haunt the roads 
 Just hold your breath, and hold fast hope 
 'Cause though the night is cold, we'll carry the fire 
 And though there's no way home, we'll carry the fire 
 We'll carry the fire 
 Where shadows hang like shrouds of lead 
 A light is shining 
 No wolven fangs, no walking dead 
 Shall quench it's flame 
 In shuttered tombs and shaking starts 
 A light is shining 
 The barren wombs, the broken hearts 
 Shall know it's name 
 And though the night is cold, we'll carry the fire 
 And though there's no way home, we'll carry the fire 
 And when my body's cold, you'll carry the fire 
 And when I'm finally home, you'll carry the fire.

Snow's coming down 
 Watching it fall 
 Watching the people around 
 Baby, please come home 
 The church bells in town 
 They're ringing a song 
 What a happy sound 
 Baby, please come home 
 They're singing 'Deck The Halls' 
 But it's not like Christmas at all 
 I remember when you were here 
 And all the fun we had last year 
 Pretty lights on the tree 
 I'm watching them shine 
 You should be here with me 
 Baby, please come home 
 They're singing 'Deck The Halls' 
 But it's not like Christmas at all 
 I remember when you were here 
 All the fun we had last year 
 If there was a way 
 I'd hold back these tears 
 But it's Christmas day 
 Baby, please, please come home 
 Baby, please come home 
 Baby, please come home 
 Baby, please, please, please 
 Please come home

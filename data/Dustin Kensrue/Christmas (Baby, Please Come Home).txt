The snow's coming down, 
 I'm watching it fall. 
 Lots of people around. 
 Baby, please come home. 
 The church bells in town. 
 Oh, They're ringing a song. 
 What a happy sound. 
 Baby, please come home. 
 They're singing Deck the Halls 
 But it's not like Christmas at all. 
 I remember when you were here, 
 All the fun we had last year. 
 Pretty lights on the tree, 
 I'm watching them shine. 
 You should be here with me. 
 Baby, please come home. 
 Baby, please come home. 
 They're singing Deck the Halls 
 But it's not like Christmas at all. 
 I remember when you were here, 
 All the fun we had last year. 
 If there was a way 
 I'd hold back these tears, 
 But it's Christmas day. 
 Baby, please, please come home. 
 Baby, please come home. 
 Baby please come home. 
 Baby, please, please, please, please come home.

Well, it's Christmas time everybody, 
 But it's raining in my heart. 
 Well, it's Christmas time everybody, 
 But it's raining in my heart. 
 And you know that I love you, baby. 
 Tell me, why must we be apart? 
 Well, you told me New Year's Eve, 
 We'd be together Christmas time. 
 Well, you told me New Year's Eve, 
 We'd be together Christmas time. 
 Well, it's Christmas Eve, my Darling, 
 Will you be here when the bells begin to chime? 
 What is a ship without a crew? 
 What is the morning without the dew? 
 What is a ship without a crew? 
 What is the morning without the dew? 
 What is my life, Little Darling? 
 A lonely Christmas without you.

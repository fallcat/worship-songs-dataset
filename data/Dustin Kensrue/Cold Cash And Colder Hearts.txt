They are sick, they are poor 
 And they die by the thousands and we look away 
 They are wolves at the door 
 And they're not gonna move us or get in our way 
 'Cause we don't have the time 
 Here at the top of the world 
 Feeling alright 
 Here at the top of the world 
 We hold our own by keeping our hearts cold 
 Different god, darker skin 
 They are just not a burden that we'd like to bear 
 They are living in "sin" 
 There are so many reasons for us not to care 
 But I'm feeling alright 
 Here at the top of the world 
 Doing just fine 
 Here at the top of the world 
 We've learned money matters most 
 So we keep our cards held close 
 Here at the top of the world 
 We hold our own by keeping our hearts cold 
 And we've learned what matters most 
 So we keep our hearts cold 
 They are no one 
 They are nowhere 
 They are not our problem 
 Not worth saving 
 Nonexistent if we keep our hearts cold 
 They are no one 
 They are nowhere

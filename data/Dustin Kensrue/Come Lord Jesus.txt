Come Lord Jesus, come 
 Come Lord Jesus, come 
 Come again to claim your own 
 Come to reap what you have sown 
 All creation weeps and groans for you 
 It's to you that we belong 
 It's to you we lift our song 
 How our spirits look and long for you 
 Like a thief in dead of night 
 Come, our everlasting light 
 Let your brilliance shame the brightest day 
 With your voice like endless seas 
 Wielding swords and stars and keys 
 Bring the nations to their knees, we pray 
 For though fitful is our flame 
 You're from age to age the same 
 Jesus, faithful is your name and true 
 So until the sun does rise 
 Till your trumpets rend the skies 
 Help us keep our restless eyes on you

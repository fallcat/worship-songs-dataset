I've got bills to pay, tax man on my tail 
 Just keep prayin' that the check's in the mail 
 There are times it seems everything's lost 
 And I'm moanin', I'm tossed and I see 
 Between the river and the ravens I'm fit 
 Between oblivion and the blazes I'm there 
 So, Father give me faith, providence and grace 
 Between the river and the ravens I'm fit 
 Sweet deliverer, You lift up my head 
 And lead me in Your way 
 I've grown sick and tired of trying to stand still 
 I've learned to let the wind pull me where it will 
 Throw myself into the will of the way 
 I can never be great 'til we're free 
 Between the river and the ravens I'm fit 
 Between oblivion and the blazes I'm there 
 So, Father give me faith, providence and grace 
 Between the river and the ravens I'm fit 
 Sweet deliverer, You lift up my head 
 And lead me in Your way 
 Although I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death 
 Evil's all around, it's comin' from the right and the left 
 Trust that I will see the glory above 
 Oh, Your banner of love flies over me 
 Between the river and the ravens I'm fit 
 Between oblivion and the blazes I'm there 
 So, Father give me faith, providence and grace 
 Between the river and the ravens I'm fit 
 Sweet deliverer, You lift up my head 
 And lead me in Your way 
 Between the river and the ravens I'm fit 
 Sweet deliverer, You lift up my head 
 And lead me in Your way

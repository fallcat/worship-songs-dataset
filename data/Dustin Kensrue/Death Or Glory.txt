An old bearded oak of a man in the street yells, 
 "A storm is coming soon". 
 The weather man says it will never rain again. 
 By their own perspective philosophies one of them's just a body. 
 Reading teleprompts in two-piece suits, 
 One of them is too strange and splendid for any to comprehend. 
 I feel somethin's coming for me. 
 Is this death or glory that hangs like lightning in the air? 
 It's been years of barren skies, 
 But I see dark horizons draped like night beyond this glare 
 Out there at the edge of town, 
 Where the wind whips up, whispering my name. 
 I walk the streets of this withered and wicked land. 
 My shadow darkens the door of a place I ain't been before, 
 But I shamble off in shame. 
 Throwing rocks at the rooks with these brittle and broken hands. 
 I feel somethin's coming for me. 
 Is this death or glory that hangs like lightning in the air? 
 It's been years of barren skies, 
 But I see dark horizons draped like night beyond this glare 
 I swear I feel the rain in my bones, 
 And I imagine thunder shattering stones, playing crack the sky. 
 I was scared I might be lost in the floor but now, 
 I see more than that I'm just longing for love and this land's so dry. 
 In the dark of the night I woke with a start, 
 And I stared across the room, 
 But all I saw was this dream burned across my brain. 
 From here to the ocean there was a field of roses, 
 I watched them burst and bloom. 
 I saw them wither and fade but revive, 
 When they felt the rain start to fall. 
 I feel somethin's coming for me. 
 Is this death or glory that hangs like lightning in the air? 
 It's been years of barren skies, 
 But I see dark horizons draped like night beyond this glare.

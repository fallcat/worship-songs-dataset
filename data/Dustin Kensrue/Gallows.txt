You work like every nail sunk, every floorboard laid 
 Is another deed erased, another debt that's paid 
 Like every story you've erected's gonna raise you up 
 So you keep slaving but it never seems to be enough 
 And now you're scared that it's all gonna crash to the ground 
 So you tied a knot and started climbing your way down 
 When you find that you've come to the end of your rope 
 Take a look and see where you were putting all your hope 
 Cause you built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 You've been holding to a noose 
 So just let go, just let go 
 You built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 And you've got nothing to lose 
 So just let go, just let go 
 I love the wood's already rotting, though you made it gleam 
 You've hidden every short cut, concealed each crooked seam 
 But every flaw will be revealed, each imperfection shown 
 Oh, I can hear the wind howl and the timber groan 
 And now you're scared that it's all gonna crash to the ground 
 So you tied a knot and started climbing your way down 
 When you find that you've come to the end of your rope 
 Take a look and see where you were putting all your hope 
 Cause you built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 You've been holding to a noose 
 So just let go, just let go 
 You built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 And you've got nothing to lose 
 So just let go, just let go 
 Cause you built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 You've been holding to a noose 
 So just let go, just let go 
 You built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 And you've got nothing to lose 
 So just let go, just let go 
 Cause you built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 You've been holding to a noose 
 So just let go, just let go 
 You built these gallows you've been hanging from 
 And you've got nothing to lose 
 So just let go, just let go

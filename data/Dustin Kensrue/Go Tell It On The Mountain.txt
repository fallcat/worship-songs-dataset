Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 Shepherds kept their watching 
 Over silent flocks by night 
 Behold throughout the Heavens 
 Shone a holy light 
 Shepherds feared and trembled 
 Low above the earth 
 Rang out the Angels chorus 
 That hailed the Savior's birth 
 Got tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 Down in a lowly manger 
 The humble Christ was born 
 God sent us salvation 
 Blessed Christmas morn 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 When I was a seeker, I sought both night and day 
 I asked the Lord to help me and He showed me the way 
 He made me a watchman upon the city walls 
 And if I am a Christian, I am the least of all 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born

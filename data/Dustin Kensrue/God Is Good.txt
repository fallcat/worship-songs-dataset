Even when it seems the answer's no 
 The promises of God all find their Yes 
 In Christ who worked the Father's will below 
 That all who run to him would find their rest 
 And even when it seems he hides his face 
 And darkness seems to be our only friend 
 We look to Christ who suffered in our place 
 That one day all our suffering would end 
 God is good, all of the time 
 All of the time, God is good 
 God is good, all of the time 
 All of the time, God is good 
 And even when it seems he pays no mind 
 We have a guarantee of his great love 
 In Christ who came and left his crown behind 
 That one day we would reign with him above 
 Lord, we believe 
 But help our unbelief 
 Lord, we believe 
 But help our hearts to sing 
 That you are good, all of the time 
 All of the time, you are good 
 You are good all, of the time 
 Your are good 
 Lord, you are good

God rest you merry, Gentlemen, let nothing you dismay. 
 Remember Christ our Savior was born upon this day; 
 To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy. 
 From God, our heavenly Father, a blessèd angel came 
 And, unto certain shepherds, brought tidings of the same; 
 How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy. 
 The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind 
 And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind, 
 And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessèd Babe to find. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy. 
 But when to Bethlehem they came, where at this Infant lay, 
 They found Him in a manger, where oxen feed on hay; 
 His mother Mary, kneeling, unto the Lord did pray. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy. 
 Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place, 
 And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace; 
 And no more walking shadow, your sins have been erased, 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy.

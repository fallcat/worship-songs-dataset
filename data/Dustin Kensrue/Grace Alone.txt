I was an orphan lost at the fall 
 Running away when I'd hear your call 
 But Father, you worked your will 
 I had no righteousness of my own 
 I had no right to draw near your throne 
 But Father, you loved me still 
 And in love before you laid the world's foundation 
 You predestined to adopt me as your own 
 You have raised me up so high above my station 
 I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone 
 You left your home to seek out the lost 
 You knew the great and terrible cost 
 But Jesus, your face was set 
 I worked my fingers down to the bone 
 Nothing I did could ever atone 
 But Jesus, you paid my debt 
 By your blood I have redemption and salvation 
 Lord, you died that I might reap what you have sown 
 And you rose that I might be a new creation 
 I am born again by grace and grace alone 
 I was in darkness all of my life 
 I never knew the day from the night 
 But Spirit, you made me see 
 I swore I knew the way on my own 
 Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone 
 But Spirit, you moved in me 
 At your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened 
 On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone 
 Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken 
 Heaven's citizen by grace and grace alone 
 So I'll stand in faith by grace and grace alone 
 I will run the race by grace and grace alone 
 I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone 
 I will reach the end by grace and grace alone

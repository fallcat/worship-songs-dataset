Seen your face in every child that smiles 
 But I can't help but rejoice 
 And I have heard what some call thunder 
 But I knew it was your voice 
 Touched the holes in your calloused hands 
 Stuck my fingers in your side 
 Oh, I was six feet deep in doubt, but 
 Now I'm sure that you're alive 
 And it's safe to say we'll never know everything 
 Still blessings we receive 
 And it's safe to say I really don't know a thing 
 Still I choose to believe 
 Smell the scent of angels sweet 
 Floatin' in the summer air 
 And I have breathed in deep the incense 
 While the saints send up their prayers 
 I have tasted and now I see, oh 
 I see that you are good 
 And I have ate your perfect body 
 I have drank your blessed blood 
 And it's safe to say we'll never know everything 
 Still blessings we receive 
 And it's safe to say I really don't know a thing 
 Still I choose to believe 
 And all the answers that I find 
 Only take me so far down the line 
 The tracks always give out 
 Yeah, it's a leap from the lion's mouth 
 And it's safe to say I really don't know a thing 
 Still blessings we receive 
 Yeah, it's safe to say I really don't know a thing 
 Still I choose to believe

You were once a sweet little girl 
 So innocent and pure 
 Your eyes were open and sure 
 Anyone could look right in 
 And I followed closely your gaze 
 You looked up towards the sky 
 And I watched your face drift away 
 Other things had caught your eye 
 Oh, the magazines and media supplied you with their plastic protocol 
 Oh, and maybe music television really is the devil after all 
 But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then 
 Before you grew up, before you gave in 
 You dream of sharin' your heart 
 Instead you share your bed 
 And your heart beats empty and cold 
 With all the tears that you have shed 
 And you dream of bearin' your soul 
 Instead you bare more skin 
 And you wear dark glasses to keep 
 Anyone from looking in 
 Oh, the magazines and media supplied you with their plastic protocol 
 Oh, and maybe music television really is the devil after all 
 But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then 
 Before you grew up, before you gave in 
 All you want is to hear is the words 
 "Dear Baby, I love you." 
 So you hike your skirt higher still 
 'Til their eyes are all on you 
 And you drive in fast foreign cars 
 The color of your sin 
 And you tint your windows to keep 
 Anyone from lookin' in 
 But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then 
 Before you grew up, before you gave in 
 And all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then 
 You could be beautiful again

Image marred by self-infliction 
 Private wars on my soul waged 
 Heart is scarred by dual volitions 
 Juxtaposed and both engaged 
 Kindle flame, a test of faith 
 Pray help me see it through 
 I put all my trust in you 
 Refine hate and love 
 Fall afresh on me 
 End this crisis of 
 Identity 
 Draw this darkness out like poison 
 Stab, retrieve, again decline 
 Help me drive the dagger deeper 
 Trace with me explicit line 
 Take this blade, a test of faith, 
 And strike me deep and true 
 I put all my trust in you 
 Refine hate and love 
 Fall afresh on me 
 End this crisis of 
 Identity 
 This is my voice, all shadows stayed this is my heart, upon the altar laid 
 Please take all else away, hear my cry, I beg, I plead, I pray 
 I'll walk into the flame, a calculated risk to further bless your name 
 So strike me deep and true, and in your strength I will live and die both unto you.

I'm always running scared through and endless night. 
 The moon is just a memory, her and her fabled light. 
 But when I close my eyes sometimes I dare to dream, 
 But I'm sure nobody cares for me, 
 No one's there with me in the darkness. 
 Sometimes I'll howl a tune to hear it echo back, 
 Then clutch it like some ancient rune to ward off the black. 
 But when the wolves join in I hold my breath and shake, 
 'Cause I'm sure nobody cares for me, 
 No one's there with me in the darkness. 
 But now I'm standing here beneath that great abyss, 
 Staring up I feel my legs give way, I feel a ghostly kiss. 
 I hear the hidden stars sing out the one true myth, 
 Their singing that you care for me, 
 And you're there with me in the darkness. 
 But I'm always running scared in the darkness 
 Could it be you're really there in the darkness? 
 It's more than I could ever dare to dream, 
 That you would care for me, 
 That you're there with me in the darkness. 
 Do you care for me? 
 Are you there in the darkness?

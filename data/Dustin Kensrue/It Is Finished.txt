There's no deed that can redeem us 
 There's no rite, no magic word 
 Only by the work of Jesus 
 Can salvation be secured 
 It is finished! He has done it! 
 Let your weary heart rejoice 
 Our redemption is accomplished 
 Raise a shout with ragged voice 
 And go bravely into battle 
 Knowing he has won the war 
 It is finished, lift your head 
 And weep no more 
 There's no sacrifice to offer 
 There's no penance to complete 
 Freely drink of living water 
 Without money come and feast 
 Let every sinner rejoice 
 Hear the dying victor's cry 
 Raise up your voice 
 Sing it out through earth and sky

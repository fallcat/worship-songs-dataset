Though all the wealth of men was mine to squander 
 And towers of ivory rose beneath my feet 
 Were palaces of pleasure mine to wander 
 The sum of it would leave me incomplete 
 Though every soul would hold my name in honor 
 And truest love was always by my side 
 My praises sung by grateful sons and daughters 
 My soul would never still be satisfied 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 I could walk the world forever 
 Till my shoes were filled with blood 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 Though I could live for all to lift them higher 
 Or spend the centuries seeking light within 
 Though I indulged my every dark desire 
 Exhausting every avenue of sin 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 I could walk the world forever 
 Till my shoes were filled with blood 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 I could right all wrongs, or ravage 
 Everything beneath the sun 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 To make me whole 
 It's not enough, it never was 
 Awake my soul 
 It's not enough, it never was 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 I could walk the world forever 
 Till my shoes were filled with blood 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 I could right all wrongs, or ravage 
 Everything beneath the sun 
 It's not enough, it's not enough 
 Though all would bow to me 
 Till I could drink my fill of fear and love 
 It's not enough, it's not enough

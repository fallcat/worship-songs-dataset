Tell them other girls "don't bother." 
 'Cause come hell or high water, 
 You're the only one for me. 
 If they can't see I'm faithfully devoted to you, 
 Well then they don't have a clue. 
 'Cause girl I'm a juggernaut, and I'll never stop loving you. 
 Baby when we get to fightin' 
 You can take your love and hide it. 
 You can rage into the night, 
 When you're ready I'll be right here waiting for you. 
 Baby my love is true, 
 I'll be your juggernaut, yeah I'll never stop loving you. 
 When you're weak nearly broken, 
 When it's hard to keep on hoping, 
 Baby I won't break or bend. 
 Yeah the only way this ends is with you in my arms. 
 With you in my arms. 
 And I'm not saying maybe, I'm telling you baby, 
 I'll never leave your side. 
 You're my once and always bride, 
 The love of my life, my beautiful wife. 
 And I'm just a juggernaut, but I'll never stop loving you.

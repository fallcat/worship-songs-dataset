Our course is coarsely plotted 
 On a map of shoddy dreams, 
 But hindsight will reveal 
 Time's moving faster than it seems. 
 Maybe I'm just selfish, 
 I've got nothing left to give. 
 I'm still a foolish boy, 
 I've got a lifetime left to live, 
 And I was swinging like a madman, 
 Not quite sure of what I felt, 
 And I might never understand 
 Exactly what it was I'd held, 
 And now I watch the sun descending 
 From the weathered gravel roof, 
 And I recall the sky once told me 
 That all lies lead to the truth. 
 So I'll look the other way, 
 And I'll turn a deafened ear, 
 And I'll talk of distant lands, 
 Pretend I was never here. 
 Reality beads on my skin 
 Like a slicker in the rain, 
 But now I feel it soaking in 
 And I begin to feel the pain. 
 I fight the urge to run to you, 
 This is how it has to be. 
 We've gotta step away right now, 
 We're just too close to see, 
 And I was swinging like a madman, 
 Not quite sure of what I felt, 
 And I might never understand 
 Exactly what it was I'd held, 
 And now I watch the sun descending 
 From the weathered gravel roof, 
 And I recall the sky once told me 
 That all lies lead to the truth. 
 So I'll look the other way, 
 And I'll turn a deafened ear, 
 And I'll talk of distant lands, 
 Pretend I was never here, 
 And I'll look the other way, 
 And I'll turn a deafened ear, 
 And I'll talk distant lands, 
 Pretend I was never here

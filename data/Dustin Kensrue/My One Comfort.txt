My one comfort both in life and death 
 Is that I am not my own 
 I was bought with blood and I confess 
 I belong to you alone 
 By the Father's good decree 
 Jesus, you've delivered me 
 By your Spirit set me free 
 To follow you 
 Jesus, you have taken hold of me 
 And in your grip of grace I'm finally free

O come, O come, Emmanuel. 
 And ransom captive Israel 
 That mourns in lonely exile here, 
 Until the Son of God appear. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel. 
 O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by Thine advent here; 
 And drive away the shades of night, 
 And pierce the clouds and bring us Light. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! 
 Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

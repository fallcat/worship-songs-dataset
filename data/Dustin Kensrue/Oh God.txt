In the valley, O God, you're near 
 In the quiet, O God, you're near 
 In the shadow, O God, you're near 
 At my breaking, O God, you're near 
 You're near 
 O God, you never leave my side 
 Your love stands firm through all my life 
 In my searching, O God, you're near 
 In my wandering, O God, you're near 
 When I feel alone, O God, you're near 
 At my lowest, O God you're near 
 You're near 
 Height nor depth 
 Nor anything else can pull us apart 
 We are joined as one by your blood 
 Hope will rise 
 As we become more than conquerors 
 Through the one who loved the world

Oh! Darling, please believe me 
 That I'll never do you no harm. 
 Believe me when I tell you: 
 I'll never do you no harm 
 Oh! Darling, if you leave me, 
 I'll never make it alone. 
 Believe me when I beg you: 
 Don't ever leave me alone. 
 When you told me you didn't need me anymore, 
 Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried. 
 When you told me you didn't need me anymore, 
 Well, you know I nearly fell down and died. 
 Oh! Darling, please believe me: 
 I'll never make you cry. 
 Believe me when I tell you: 
 I'll never do you no wrong. 
 When you told me you didn't need me anymore, 
 Well, you know I nearly fell down and cried. 
 When you told me you didn't need me anymore, 
 Well, you know I nearly fell down and died. 
 Oh! Darling, if you leave me, 
 I'll never make it alone. 
 Believe me when I tell you: 
 I'll never make it alone!

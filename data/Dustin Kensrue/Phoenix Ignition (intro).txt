Like a phoenix ignition 
 Like a crematorium 
 Like a swelling volition 
 From the barrel of a gun 
 From the ashes and the embers 
 Like a rocket I'll ascend 
 Like a cry gone up for a fallen friend 
 Like a cry gone up for a fallen... 
 Like a phoenix ignition 
 Like a crematorium 
 Like a swelling volition 
 From the barrel of a gun 
 From the ashes and the embers 
 Like a rocket I'll ascend 
 Like a cry gone up for a fallen friend 
 I'll ascend 
 Everyday tear down the walls 
 Till cornerstones remain 
 Coming ONE STEP CLOSER ALL THE TIME 
 And although we'll never reach perfection ALWAYS PERSIST TO TRY 
 No regrets, just rebirth 
 Move forward, and ignite. 
 Incandescent Reinvention 
 A new renaissance 
 A new fire each day 
 A new fire each day... day... day... day!

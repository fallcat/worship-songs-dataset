I love how you curse when I wake you up 
 And sweetly demand that I fill your cup 
 With the smile of your cool gunpowder glare 
 Honey, you lay me bare 
 You're the girl of my dreams 
 And a pistol it seems 
 But you shoot me straight and true 
 Time to lay down my bets 
 Oh, I put all my money on you 
 When I'm in the dark, girl, you bring me light 
 It seems like you're almost always right 
 So keep boxin' my ears when I sew them shut 
 Baby, you sure are tough 
 You're the girl of my dreams 
 And a pistol it seems 
 But you shoot me straight and true 
 Time to lay down my fears 
 Honey, I feel so safe around you 
 If the tiller man taught me anything 
 It's that a hard-headed woman is what I need 
 To help me to always do my best 
 Baby, my life is blessed 
 You're the girl of my dreams 
 Darlin', please wear this ring 
 You're an angel through and through 
 Time to lay down my life 
 Honey, I'd do it gladly for you 
 Time to lay down my life 
 Honey, I'd do it gladly for you

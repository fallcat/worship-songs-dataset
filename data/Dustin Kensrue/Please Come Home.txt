Well I woke one morning, 
 Found you staring down at me. 
 You said, "I'll take my share now, father, please" 
 And you took your money, 
 And you took your leave. 
 You drilled my heart and turned your back on me. 
 And you hit the town, 
 And you hit the bottle hard. 
 You race 'round 
 In your fancy cars 
 And you blow all your money, 
 On brothels, beds, and bars, 
 Before you know your broken times get hard. 
 I still stand here waiting, 
 With my eyes fixed on the road. 
 And I fight back tears and I wonder 
 If you're ever coming home. 
 Don't you know, son, that I love you 
 And I don't care where you've been? 
 So please come home. 
 And now you've hit bottom. 
 All those open doors have shut 
 And your hungry stomach's tied in knots, 
 But I know what you're thinking: 
 That you troubled me enough. 
 Nothing could ever separate you from my love. 
 I still stand here waiting, 
 With my eyes fixed on the road. 
 And I fight back tears and I wonder 
 If you're ever coming home. 
 Don't you know, son, that I love you 
 And I don't care where you've been? 
 Yes, and I'll be right here waiting, 
 Till you come around the bend. 
 And I run to you and hold you close, 
 Won't let go again. 
 So please come home. 
 Please come home. 
 Don't you know, son, that I love you 
 And I don't care where you've been? 
 So please come home.

I will bless You all of my days, Lord 
 I will praise You always, my God and King 
 I will bless and honor Your name, Lord 
 Always and forever, my soul will sing 
 Such a vast, unsearchable greatness 
 Great is Yahweh, worthy of all our praise 
 Let Your people sound through the ages 
 All Your awesome works till the end of days 
 We have seen Your splendor and glory 
 We have seen Your wonders and stand amazed 
 Every tongue will echo Your story 
 Everyone will sing of Your righteous ways 
 O let all that lives ever bless His name! 
 All that You have made, Lord, will praise You 
 All Your saints will worship in joyful strains 
 Praise the Lord, who ransoms and rescues 
 Praise the God of glory, who ever reigns 
 He is holy, judging the wicked 
 Guarding those that love Him and fear His name 
 All that call out, Yahweh is with them 
 He will hear their cries, He is strong to save 
 He upholds the one who is stumbling, 
 Lifting up those burdened with heavy loads; 
 Opening His hand to the hungry, 
 Blessing all that look to their Lord and hope! 
 He is tender toward His creation; 
 He is faithful, gracious in all He does! 
 Great is Yahweh, full of compassion, 
 Slow to anger, filled with unfailing love! 
 O let all that lives ever bless His name! 
 O let all that lives ever bless His name!

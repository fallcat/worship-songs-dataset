I was tuned into the light of the late night dial 
 Doing anything my radio advised 
 With everyone of those late night stations 
 Playing songs bringing tears to my eyes 
 I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver 
 When the switch broke 'cause it's old 
 Saying things that I can hardly believe 
 They really think we're gettin' out of control 
 Radio is the sound salvation 
 Radio is cleaning up the nation 
 Say you better listen to the Voice of Reason 
 But they don't give you any choice 
 'Cause they think that it's treason 
 You had better do as you were told 
 Better listen to the radio 
 I wanna bite the hand that feeds me 
 I wanna bite that hand so badly 
 I wanna make them wish they'd never seen me 
 Some of my freinds sit around every evening 
 And they worry about the times ahead 
 Everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference 
 And the promise of an early bed 
 You either shut up or get cut out 
 They don't wanna hear about it 
 It's only inches on the reel to reel 
 The radio is in the hands 
 Of such a bunch of fools 
 Tryin' to anesthetize they way that you feel 
 Radio is the sound salvation 
 Radio is cleaning up the nation 
 Say you better listen to the Voice Of Reason 
 But they don't give any choice 
 'Cause they think that its treason 
 So you had better do as you were told 
 Better listen to the radio 
 Radio 
 Radio

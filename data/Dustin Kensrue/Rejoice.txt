Come and stand before your Maker 
 Full of wonder, full of fear 
 Come behold His power and glory 
 Yet with confidence draw near 
 For the one who holds the heavens 
 And commands the stars above 
 Is the God who bends to bless us 
 With an unrelenting love 
 Rejoice, come and lift your hands and 
 Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise 
 Rejoice, sing of mercies of your King 
 And with trembling, rejoice 
 We are children of the promise 
 The beloved of the Lord 
 Won with everlasting kindness 
 Bought with sacrificial blood 
 Bringing reconciliation 
 To a world that longs to know 
 The affections of a Father 
 Who will never let them go 
 Rejoice, come and lift your hands and 
 Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise 
 Rejoice, sing of mercies of your King 
 And with trembling, rejoice 
 All our sickness, all our sorrows 
 Jesus carried up the hill 
 He has walked this path before us 
 He is walking with us still 
 Turning tragedy to triumph 
 Turning agony to praise 
 There is blessing in the battle 
 So take heart and stand amazed 
 Rejoice, when you cry to Him He hears 
 Your voice, He will wipe away your tears 
 Rejoice, in the midst of suffering 
 He will help you sing 
 Rejoice, come and lift your hands and 
 Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise 
 Rejoice, sing of mercies of your King 
 And with trembling rejoice

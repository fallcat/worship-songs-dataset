Rock of Ages, cleft for me 
 Let me hide myself in thee 
 Let the water and the blood 
 From thy wounded side which flowed 
 Be of sin the double cure 
 Save from wrath and make me pure 
 Not the labors of my hands 
 Can fulfill the law's commands 
 Should my passion never fade 
 And my efforts all be weighed 
 All for sin could not atone 
 You must save and you alone 
 Rock of Ages 
 No one takes your life 
 Yet you died that I might live 
 Costly grace you freely give 
 Rock of Ages 
 You have paid the price 
 You were cleft to cover me 
 Let my hide myself in thee 
 Nothing in my hand I bring 
 Simply to the cross I cling 
 Naked come to thee for dress 
 Helpless look to thee for grace 
 Wretched to the fount I fly 
 Wash me, Savior, or I die 
 And while I draw my final breath 
 I'll rest upon your grace 
 And when I close my eyes in death 
 I'll wake to see your face

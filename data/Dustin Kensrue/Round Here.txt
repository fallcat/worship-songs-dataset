Step out the front door like a ghost 
 Into the fog where no one notices 
 The contrast of white on white. 
 And in between the moon and you 
 The angels get a better view 
 Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right. 
 I walk in the air between the rain 
 Through myself and back again 
 Where? I don't know 
 Maria says she's dying 
 Through the door I hear her crying 
 Why? I don't know 
 Round here we always stand up straight 
 Round here something radiates 
 Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand 
 She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis 
 And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land 
 Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus 
 She parks her car outside of my house 
 And, you know 
 Says she's close to understanding Jesus 
 She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood 
 Yes, she has trouble acting normal when she's nervous 
 Round here we're carving out our names 
 Round here we all look the same 
 Round here we talk, talk just like lions 
 Oh, but we sacrifice like lambs 
 Round here she's slipping through my hands 
 She says "It's only in my head" 
 She says "I know it's only in my head" 
 But the girl on the car in the parking lot 
 Says "Man you should try to take a shot 
 Can't you see my walls are crumbling?" 
 Then she looks up at the building 
 And sge says "I'm thinking of jumping" 
 She says "I'm sick and tired of life" 
 Everybody's tired of something 
 Round here she's always on my mind 
 Round here we've got lots of time 
 We never go to bed early 
 And nobody makes us wait 
 Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late 
 I can't see nothing... nothing round here 
 Would you catch if I'm falling 
 Would you kiss me 'cause I'm leaving 
 Would you hold me 'cause I'm lonely without you 
 I said I'm under the gun around here 
 I said I'm under the gun around here 
 I said I'm lonely lonely lonely round here

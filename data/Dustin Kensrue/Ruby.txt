I've been foolish and blind, 
 Time after time, girl, I've let you down. 
 And I'm losing my mind, 
 Tryin' to find a way to show you now, 
 That you are all I want. 
 You are all I want. 
 Girl, I'm down on my knees, 
 Begging you please, I need another chance. 
 But you're not looking at me, 
 Are you hearing my plea? 
 Won't you take my hand? 
 'Cause Ruby, you're all that I want, 
 My heart and my treasure. 
 Ruby, you're all that I need, 
 For now and forever. 
 You are all I want. 
 You are all I want. 
 I know that talk is cheap, 
 And words seem weak, 
 Coming from this broken man. 
 Still, I will speak, 'cause I can't sleep, 
 Until you truly understand. 
 'Cause Ruby, you're all that I want, 
 My heart and my treasure. 
 Ruby, you're all that I need, 
 For now and forever. 
 Don't want diamonds or gold, 
 When I've got my ruby to hold. 
 You know I'm in ecstasy, 
 I can't ever get enough. 
 Don't want platinum or pearls, 
 I'd trade all the jewels in the world, 
 Just to have you next to me. 
 I can't live Without your love, no... 
 'Cause Ruby, you're all that I want, 
 My heart and my treasure. 
 Ruby, you're all that I need, 
 For now and forever. 
 Ruby, you're all that I want, 
 My heart and my treasure. 
 Ruby, you're all that I need, 
 For now and forever. 
 Ruby, you're all that I want, 
 My heart and my treasure. 
 Ruby, you're all that I need, 
 For now and forever. 
 You are all I want.

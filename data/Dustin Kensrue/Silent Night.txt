Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright 
 Round yon Virgin Mother and Child 
 Holy Infant so tender and mild 
 Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace 
 Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight 
 Glories stream from heaven afar 
 Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia 
 Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born 
 Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure light 
 Radiant beams from Thy holy face 
 With the dawn of redeeming grace 
 Jesus, Lord at Thy birth, Jesus, Lord at Thy birth

I sit here clutching useless lists, 
 Keys for doors that don't exist 
 I crack my teeth on pearls 
 I tear into the history 
 Show me what it means to me in this world 
 Yeah, in this world 
 'Cause I am due for a miracle 
 I'm waiting for a sign 
 I'll stare straight into the sun 
 And I won't close my eyes 
 Till I understand or go blind 
 I see the parts but not the whole 
 I study saints and scholars both 
 No perfect plan unfurls 
 Do I trust my heart or just my mind 
 Why is truth so hard to find in this world 
 Yeah in this world 
 'Cause I am due for a miracle 
 I'm waiting for a sign 
 I'll stare straight into the sun 
 And I won't close my eyes 
 Till I understand or go blind (till I understand or go blind) 
 I know that there's a point I've missed 
 A shrine or stone I haven't kissed 
 A scar that never graced my wrist 
 A mirror that hasn't met my fist 
 But I can't help feeling like I'm 
 Due for a miracle 
 I'm waiting for a sign (waiting for a sign) 
 I'll stare straight into the sun 
 And I won't close my eyes (and I won't close my eyes) 
 Due for a miracle 
 I'm waiting for a sign 
 I'll stare straight into the sun 
 And I won't close my eyes

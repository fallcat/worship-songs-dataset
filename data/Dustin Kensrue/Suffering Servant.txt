His appearance was so badly marred 
 He could not have been recognized 
 So disfigured, so beyond all human likeness 
 That we hid our eyes 
 Though he carried all our griefs and bore our sorrows 
 We esteemed him not 
 But despised him and considered him afflicted 
 And as one reviled by God 
 Though all of us have gone astray 
 Though all have turned to their own ways 
 The Lord has laid our wickedness on him 
 His punishment has brought us peace 
 And crushed for our iniquities 
 He died to save his people from their sin 
 He was stricken, and though pierced for our transgressions 
 He did not lash out 
 But was silent, like a lamb led to the slaughter 
 So he opened not his mouth 
 The might of Yahweh stands revealed 
 And by his wounds we are all healed 
 He offered up his soul to death 
 He poured it out till none was left 
 He died but now shall rise and surely see 
 The many he has righteous made 
 And satisfied, his work surveyed 
 The man of sorrows evermore shall be 
 On high, exalted, lifted up 
 The righteous servant raised above 
 His mighty hand shall work the will of God 
 The nations all shall hear and see 
 Astonished at his victory 
 The kings of men shall shut their mouths in awe

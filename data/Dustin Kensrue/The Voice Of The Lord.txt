The voice of the Lord is over the waters 
 In splendor and power, igniting the air 
 The voice of the Lord shatters the cedars 
 It flashes like fire till forests are bare 
 And we cry glory, glory 
 We hear his voice and we cry glory 
 The voice of the Lord in torrents of thunder 
 The deserts will flood, the mountains will shake 
 The voice of the Lord, destroying all idols 
 The high places fall, the wilderness quakes 
 The Lord, he alone sits enthroned forever 
 The one Sovereign King 
 He will rain down strength and peace 
 He alone, sits enthroned forever 
 The one Sovereign King 
 He will reign with grace and glory

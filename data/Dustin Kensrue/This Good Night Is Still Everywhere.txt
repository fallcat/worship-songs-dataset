I know somewhere the sun is up and it's 95 degrees, 
 But here the stars are shining and there's frost on all the trees. 
 And everything looks beautiful, as far as I can see. 
 This Good Night is still everywhere to me. 
 Gospel's on the radio, like Jesus come to town. 
 Right outside my window, I see snowflakes falling down. 
 And everything looks beautiful, as far as I can see, 
 This Good Night is still everywhere to me. 
 The children in bed dreaming, the fire's blazing bright. 
 My True Love nestles near me in the sweet and silent night. 
 And everything looks beautiful, as far as I can see, 
 And this Good Night is still everywhere to me. 
 And this Good Night is still everywhere to me.

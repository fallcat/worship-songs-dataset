This is war, like you ain't seen. 
 This winter's long, it's cold and mean. 
 With hangdog hearts we stood condemned, 
 But the tide turns now at Bethlehem. 
 This is war, and born tonight 
 The Word as flesh, the Lord of Light. 
 The Son of God, the low-born King; 
 Who demons fear, of Whom angels sing. 
 This is war on sin and death; 
 The dark will take it's final breath. 
 It shakes the earth, confounds all plans; 
 The mystery of God as man.

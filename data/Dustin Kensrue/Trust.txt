 Mix the chemicals right dear

 Any speed you drive can be dangerous 
 Mix the chemicals right dear, mix the chemicals right 
 Yeah you know there's a fine line between 
 Mix the chemicals right dear, mix the chemicals right 
 'Cause I know what betrayal can mean 
 When this frame fails me

 But I know what a promise can do. 
 Will I trust you, will I trust you to carry me through? 
 I will trust you, 'cause I know what a promise can do

For years we fought the night, 
 Pale and ghostly plains, 
 But some still dream of light. 
 Say the sun will rise again. 
 And cure our need for wrongs 
 And cool and measured crime. 
 We learn to drift in palm, 
 From our hearts and from our minds. 
 Let us not be faithless, 
 For You will meet our needs. 
 That good and gracious Word is 
 A lamp unto our feet. 
 For years we've closed our eyes, 
 While rust on reason grows. 
 We feed and clothe our lies, 
 But in our hearts we know. Yeah, we know 
 That wisdom lends us all 
 A cool and steady hand. 
 The steel pressed to my palm, 
 Doesn't make me more of a man. 
 So courage, Father, give us 
 To do what must be done: 
 To deal out truth and justice 
 With swift and sobered guns. 
 For years You met our thirst, 
 Still deserts we have roamed. 
 We'll be done with dust and dirt, 
 When the ocean calls us home. 
 We fall into the arms 
 Of a cool and sweet embrace; 
 And under stars and waving palms, 
 We'll shed our sin like snakes. 
 And time will cease to stalk us. 
 Death will be undone. 
 We'll shine with the light of 
 A thousand blazing suns. 
 Time will cease to stalk us. 
 Death will be undone. 
 We'll shine with the light of 
 A thousand blazing suns.

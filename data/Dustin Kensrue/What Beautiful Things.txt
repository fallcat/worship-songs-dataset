Leaves are falling, the wolves are calling 
 And death goes with them. 
 The light is waning the night will reign o'er me 
 But in the heart of the deepest dark, the light is shining 
 I lift my head from my dying bed and sing 
 Oh what beautiful things I see 
 The lunatics with the fire-sticks and the deadly rhythm, 
 They reprimand us with reckless savagery. 
 But in the midst of apocalypse, the dove brings tidings 
 I lift my eyes to the the azure skies and sing. 
 Oh what beautiful things I see 
 We're so surprised when we realize that we're deftly skilled in 
 The very vices we swear off violently 
 Still at the crux of the worst in us, the hope is hiding. 
 I lift my gaze from my wicked ways and sing 
 Oh what beautiful things I see

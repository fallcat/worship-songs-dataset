Your church sings in chorus 
 To tell how great and glorious You are God 
 Our hearts respond to greatness, God 
 There is no other name that is higher 
 All around the world we sing your praises out 
 Your name is great, we celebrate 
 Jesus, your fame is what we're living for 
 A life of praise, we celebrate 
 Your people gather to proclaim 
 The rising anthem of your name, God 
 Our hearts respond to greatness, God 
 There is no other name that is higher 
 All around the world we sing your praises out 
 Your name is great, we celebrate 
 Jesus, your fame is what we're living for 
 A life of praise, we celebrate 
 We listen and we move, our hearts respond to you 
 We listen and we move, our hearts respond to you

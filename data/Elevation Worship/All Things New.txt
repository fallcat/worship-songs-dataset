Hear the sound of our chains 
 They come crashing down 
 There's freedom in your name 
 The cross erased our guilt and shame 
 The past can't condemn the ones 
 Who bear your name 
 We found our hope in you 
 We found our hope in you 
 You make all things new, new life found in you 
 You restore the years that we have wasted 
 You make all things new, your love breaking through 
 There's healing in your wake and we are changed 
 Hear the shout of your church 
 The rescued and redeemed Lord we are yours 
 Saved by grace by grace we live 
 Nothing separates the love you give 
 We found our hope in you 
 We found our hope in you 
 You make all things new, new life found in you 
 You restore the years that we have wasted 
 You make all things new, your love breaking through 
 There's healing in your wake and we are changed 
 We found our hope in you 
 We found our hope in you 
 We found our hope in you 
 We found our hope in you 
 We found our hope in you 
 We found our hope in you 
 You make all things new, new life found in you 
 You restore the years that we have wasted 
 You make all things new, your love breaking through 
 There's healing in your wake and we are changed 
 You leave healing in your wake and we are changed 
 There is healing in your name for us to change

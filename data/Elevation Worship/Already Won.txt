Welcome to a place 
 Where rejoicing reigns 
 Cause our God is great 
 And greatly to be praised 
 Tell it all around 
 That it's going down 
 Cause our God is great 
 And greatly to be praised 
 Turn it up 
 Till the walls are shaking 
 We're ready now 
 Come alive in the name of Jesus 
 Now the party has begun 
 Come and celebrate this love 
 Cause our God already won 
 Now we're dancing to the sound of freedom 
 Lift your voice and sing 
 If you've been redeemed 
 Cause our God is great 
 And greatly to be praised 
 If He brought you out 
 Lift your voice and shout 
 Cause our God is great 
 And greatly to be praised 
 Turn it up 
 Till the walls are shaking 
 We're ready now 
 Come alive in the name of Jesus 
 Now the party has begun 
 Come and celebrate this love 
 Cause our God already won 
 Now we're dancing to the sound of freedom 
 Turn it up 
 Till the walls are shaking 
 We're ready now 
 Come alive in the name of Jesus 
 Now the party has begun 
 Come and celebrate this love 
 Cause our God already won 
 Now we're dancing to the sound of freedom 
 The party has begun 
 Come and celebrate this love 
 Cause our God already won 
 Now we're dancing to the sound of freedom

The evening stars and the morning sky 
 They were made by your hands for the joy and your pleasure 
 You laid your riches and glory aside 
 And you came to the earth just to make me Your treasure 
 How great you are, How great you are 
 I am amazed by You 
 I am amazed by You 
 By the cross where you died, you raised me to life 
 And your grace is making me new 
 I am amazed by You 
 You filled my heart with your glorious light 
 By the touch of your hand I was gently awakened 
 You took my sickness and gave me Your life 
 And you healed every hurt of a heart that was breaking 
 I am amazed... 
 I am amazed by You 
 I am amazed by You 
 By the cross where you died, you raised me to life 
 And your grace is making me new 
 I am amazed by You

Awaken my heart, awaken my soul 
 To tell of all you've done 
 Awaken my heart, awaken my soul 
 To sing of your great love 
 I lift my cry to you oh God 
 Only you can save 
 I will not fear the darkness here 
 Where the lions wait 
 You send from heaven and you rescue me 
 I will take refuge in the shadow of your wing 
 I will run hard into your arms 
 Lord you carry me 
 Despite my pain your plan remains 
 You will deliver me 
 God you lifted me out 
 God you lifted me out 
 And I'll tell all the world

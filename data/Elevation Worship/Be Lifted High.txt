Lay down my rights 
 Lay down my life 
 I will abandon 
 All of my pride 
 Focus my eyes 
 Away from myself 
 You become greater 
 I become less 
 You be lifted high 
 You be lifted higher 
 I belong to you 
 I am nothing without you 
 Jesus be all 
 Consume every part 
 My greatest desire 
 I give You my heart 
 Focus my eyes 
 Away from myself 
 You become greater 
 I become less 
 In every victory 
 In every trial 
 My soul will sing 
 Be lifted high 
 With every heartbeat 
 All of my life 
 You will forever be lifted high

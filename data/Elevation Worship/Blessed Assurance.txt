Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine 
 O what a foretaste of glory divine 
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God 
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood 
 Perfect submission, all is at rest 
 I in my Savior am happy and blessed 
 Watching and waiting, looking above 
 Filled with His goodness, lost in His love 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 Oh what a Savior, wonderful Jesus 
 Oh what a Savior, wonderful Jesus 
 Oh what a Savior, wonderful Jesus 
 Oh what a Savior, wonderful Jesus 
 Death could not hold You, You are victorious 
 Praise to the risen King 
 Death could not hold You, You are victorious 
 Praise to the risen King 
 Oh what a Savior, wonderful Jesus 
 Oh what a Savior, wonderful Jesus 
 Oh what a Savior, wonderful Jesus 
 Oh what a Savior 
 Wonderful Savior

We need no other hiding place 
 Our hope is safe within your name 
 This we know, this we know 
 You promise never to forsake 
 What you began you will sustain 
 This we know, this we know 
 I will call upon the Lord 
 For he alone is strong enough to save 
 Rise your shackles are no more 
 For Jesus Christ 
 Has broken every chain 
 All of the heavens and the earth 
 Announce the fullness of your worth 
 This we know, this we know 
 The enemy will have to flee 
 As we declare your victory 
 This we know, this we know 
 I will call upon the Lord 
 For he alone is strong enough to save 
 Rise your shackles are no more 
 For Jesus Christ 
 Has broken every chain 
 Jesus' name will break every stronghold 
 Freedom is ours when we call his name 
 Jesus' name above every other 
 All hale the power of Jesus' name 
 I will call upon the Lord 
 For he alone is strong enough to save 
 Rise your shackles are no more 
 For Jesus Christ 
 Has broken every chain

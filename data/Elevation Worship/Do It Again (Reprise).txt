We never will forget 
 We won't forget Your mercy, God 
 We won't forget Your grace 
 'Cause You move and You didn't have to move 
 And You made a way 
 (Yes, You made a way) 
 So we rest in You 
 We rest in You 
 (You're faithful) 
 Oh, oh 
 'Cause I've seen You move 
 You move the mountains 
 And I believe I'll see You do it again 
 You made a way where there was no way 
 And I believe I'll see You do it again 
 I've seen You move 
 You move the mountains 
 And I believe I'll see You do it again 
 You made a way 
 Where there was no way 
 And I believe I'll see You do it again 
 I'll see You do it again

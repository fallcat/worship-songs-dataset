Walking around these walls 
 I thought by now they'd fall 
 But You have never failed me yet 
 Waiting for change to come 
 Knowing the battle's won 
 For You have never failed me yet 
 Your promise still stands 
 Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness 
 I'm still in Your hands 
 This is my confidence 
 You've never failed me yet 
 I know the night won't last 
 Your word will come to pass 
 My heart will sing Your praise again 
 Jesus, You're still enough 
 Keep me within Your love 
 My heart will sing Your praise again 
 Your promise still stands 
 Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness 
 I'm still in Your hands 
 This is my confidence 
 You've never failed 
 Your promise still stands 
 Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness 
 I'm still in Your hands 
 This is my confidence 
 You've never failed me yet 
 I've seen You move 
 You move the mountains 
 And I believe 
 I'll see You do it again 
 You made a way 
 Where there was no way 
 And I believe 
 I'll see You do it again 
 I've seen You move 
 You move the mountains 
 And I believe 
 I'll see You do it again 
 You made a way 
 Where there was no way 
 And I believe 
 I'll see You do it again 
 I've seen You move 
 You move the mountains 
 And I believe 
 I'll see You do it again 
 You made a way 
 Where there was no way 
 And I believe 
 I'll see You do it again 
 I'll see You do it again 
 Your promise still stands 
 Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness 
 I'm still in Your hands 
 This is my confidence 
 You've never failed 
 Your promise still stands 
 Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness 
 I'm still in Your hands 
 This is my confidence 
 You've never failed me yet 
 And You've never failed me yet 
 I never will forget 
 You've never failed me yet 
 I never will forget

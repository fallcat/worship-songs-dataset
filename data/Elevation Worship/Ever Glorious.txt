You are gracious in majesty 
 You're the mighty and humble King 
 You have always been 
 You will always be 
 You were crowned with my sin and shame 
 You're enthroned in the highest praise 
 You have always been 
 You will always be 
 So we lift the cross 
 His banner over us 
 For the Lord our God 
 Is ever glorious 
 And the heavens shout 
 Declaring over us 
 That the Lord our God 
 Is ever glorious 
 You are constant forevermore 
 You're exalted and still adored 
 You have always been 
 You will always be 
 You surrendered in victory 
 You are risen to life in me 
 You have always been 
 You will always be 
 Ever glorious 
 Is the name of Christ 
 And his love endures 
 Ever glorious

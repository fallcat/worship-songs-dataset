Turn my heart to You, O God 
 Remind me of Your promise 
 You restore what I have lost 
 Draw me near 
 Never-failing comforter 
 My present help in trouble 
 Though the earth gives way beneath 
 You are here 
 Everlasting Father 
 Enduring love forever 
 Your kindness makes me stronger 
 You run to me 
 You run to me 
 Even when I wander far 
 Your presence never leaves me 
 Your voice of mercy calls me home 
 Draws me close 
 I am loved, I am loved 
 By my Father, I'm forever Yours

In the midst of the darkness 
 Your light, it guides me through 
 Our eyes are on You 
 You are near to the broken 
 Though we find the strength in You 
 Our eyes are on You 
 When I'm lost in the madness 
 Your peace, it calms my soul 
 Our eyes are on You 
 You bring hope to the hopeless 
 Your love, it won't let go 
 Our eyes are on You 
 We lift our eyes to You 
 Where our help comes from 
 Our love is found in You 
 Jesus, Lord of all, we lift our eyes to You 
 Exalted One, exalted One 
 In the midst of the darkness 
 Your light, it guides me through 
 Our eyes are on You 
 You are near to the broken 
 Though we find the strength in You 
 Our eyes are on You 
 We lift our eyes to You 
 Where our help comes from 
 Our love is found in You 
 Jesus, Lord of all, we lift our eyes to You 
 Exalted One, exalted One 
 Your promises, your love Endures 
 Nothing can shake the standing of yours 
 We're not afraid, we're full of love 
 We'll never leave; You'll never let us go 
 We lift our eyes to You 
 Where our help comes from 
 Our love is found in You 
 Jesus, Lord of all, we lift our eyes to You 
 Exalted One, exalted One

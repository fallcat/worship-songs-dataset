Draw me again 
 Into the center of your love 
 Where I began 
 I know that you are still enough 
 Lord you restore 
 All the desires of my heart 
 Just like before 
 When I discovered who you are 
 I need you more 
 I need you more than ever 
 I need you more 
 Jesus I need you more 
 I will abide 
 Be still and know that you are God 
 For you are mine 
 And in your presence I'm alive 
 Here in this place 
 Within your shadow I am safe 
 Every mistake 
 Fading into the light of grace 
 I need you more 
 I need you more than ever 
 I need you more 
 Jesus I need you more 
 (x2) 
 Be my heart's obsession 
 First and only in my life 
 In your love alone 
 My soul is satisfied 
 (x4) 
 I need you more 
 I need you more than ever 
 I need you more 
 Jesus I need you more 
 (x2)

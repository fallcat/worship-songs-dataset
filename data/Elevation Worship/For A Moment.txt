Peace be still you are with me 
 In this hope I abide 
 Jesus be my sustainer 
 Strengthen me in this trial 
 And I know, it's only for a moment 
 And everything is working for your glory 
 But I need, your perfect love to hold me 
 Safe within your promise 
 Till the storm has passed 
 When this burden is lifted 
 I'll give praise to your name 
 But until it is finished 
 I'll give thanks just the same 
 For we have this hope 
 As an anchor for our soul 
 You are with us 
 We will never be alone

For the honor of the Father 
 Who reaches out to us 
 That we might live inside His love 
 He gave His only Son 
 For the honor of the Savior 
 Let the cross be lifted high 
 The great exchange of love and grace 
 Came down to give us life 
 For the honor of the Spirit 
 Whose power lives in us 
 That we might see much greater things 
 As we embrace Your love 
 For the honor of Your kingdom 
 Whose reign will never end 
 We'll give our lives in sacrifice 
 Until You come again 
 Forever, forever 
 We'll honor You forever

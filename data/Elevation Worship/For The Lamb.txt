On a shameful day He died 
 In the sorrow of defeat 
 But forgiveness was His cry 
 As His blood ran down for me 
 How the Father's heart was torn 
 As His only Son was slain 
 But the earth would soon rejoice 
 From the place where hope was lain 
 For the Lamb has overcome 
 Everlasting love has won 
 In eternal praise we will lift Him up 
 For the Lamb has overcome the world 
 By His Spirit we are raised 
 To the fullness of new life 
 In a moment we'll be changed 
 And forever glorified 
 Most high and lifted up 
 Be glorified forever 
 Jesus has overcome 
 Declare it now together

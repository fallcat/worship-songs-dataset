Here I lay my life down 
 To be found, found in You 
 Here I empty myself 
 To be filled, again with You 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over again 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever I'll run, again to Your love 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever my God, Your love is enough 
 There's no treasure on earth 
 That compares to who You are 
 I surrender it all 
 Just to know, know You more 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over again 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever I'll run, again to Your love 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever my God, Your love is enough 
 Where You are, there I'll be 
 What You speak, I will see 
 I will see Your glory 
 I will see Your glory 
 Where You are, there I'll be 
 What You speak, I will see 
 I will see Your glory 
 I will see Your glory 
 Where You are, there I'll be 
 What You speak, I will see 
 I will see Your glory 
 I will see Your glory 
 Where You are, there I'll be 
 What You speak, I will see 
 I will see Your glory 
 I will see Your glory 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever I'll run, again to Your love 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever my God, Your love is enough 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever I'll run, again to Your love 
 You are, the strength of my heart 
 Forever my God, Your love is enough 
 Where You are, there I'll be 
 What You speak, I'll see 
 I will see Your glory 
 I will see Your glory 
 Where You are, there I'll be 
 What You speak, I'll see 
 I will see Your glory 
 I will see Your glory 
 I will see Your glory

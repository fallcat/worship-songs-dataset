When my fear is overwhelming 
 On Your promise I will stand 
 You are faithful to the end 
 When my enemies surround me 
 I am safe within Your hand 
 You are faithful to the end 
 And when the battle comes 
 I know You're my defender 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 And when the victory's won 
 I know I'll still be standing 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 Let Your presence go before me 
 Into places I can't see 
 You are everything I need 
 Let my weakness show Your glory 
 And my scars declare Your strength 
 You are everything I need 
 And when the battle comes 
 I know You're my defender 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 And when the victory's won 
 I know I'll still be standing 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 Our hands are lifted up 
 The King of Glory fights for us 
 One Word will rise above 
 In Jesus' Name we overcome 
 Our hands are lifted up 
 The King of Glory fights for us 
 One Word will rise above 
 In Jesus' Name we overcome 
 And when the battle comes 
 I know You're my defender 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 And when the victory's won 
 I know I'll still be standing 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 A mighty fortress is our God 
 A mighty fortress is our God

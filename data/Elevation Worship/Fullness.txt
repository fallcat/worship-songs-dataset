Fullness of eternal promise 
 Stirring in Your sons and daughters 
 Earth revealing heaven's wonders 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 What You spoke is now unfolding 
 All Your children shall behold it 
 Dreams awaken in this moment 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Pour it out 
 Let Your love run over 
 Here and now 
 Let Your glory fill this house 
 Pour it out 
 Let Your love run over 
 Here and now 
 Let Your glory fill this house 
 Now the world awaits Your presence 
 And this power is within us 
 We will rise to be Your witness 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Pour it out 
 Let Your love run over 
 Here and now 
 Let Your glory fill this house 
 Pour it out 
 Let Your love run over 
 Here and now 
 Let Your glory fill this house 
 Tongues of fire 
 Testifying of the Son 
 One desire 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Speak revival 
 Prophesy like it is done 
 One desire 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Tongues of fire 
 Testifying of the Son 
 One desire 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Speak revival 
 Prophesy like it is done 
 One desire 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Spirit come 
 Let our hearts continue burning 
 For our King is soon returning 
 As we hold to this assurance 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Pour it out 
 Let Your love run over 
 Here and now 
 Let Your glory fill this house 
 Pour it out 
 Let Your love run over 
 Here and now 
 Let Your glory fill this house, oh 
 Tongues of fire 
 Testifying of the Son 
 One desire 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Speak revival 
 Prophesy like it is done 
 One desire 
 Spirit come, Spirit come 
 Holy Spirit come

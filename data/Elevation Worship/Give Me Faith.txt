I need you to soften my heart 
 To break me apart 
 I need you to open my eyes 
 To see that You're shaping my life 
 All I am 
 I surrender 
 Give me faith to trust what you say 
 That you're good and your love is great 
 I'm broken inside, I give you my life 
 I need you to soften my heart 
 To break me apart 
 I need you to pierce through the dark 
 And cleanse every part of me 
 I may be weak 
 Your Spirit's strong in me 
 My flesh may fail 
 My God you never will

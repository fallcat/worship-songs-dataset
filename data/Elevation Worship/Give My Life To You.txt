I can hear you 
 You're calling my name 
 The ocean between us erased 
 And salvation 
 Pours down like rain 
 Flooding my walls till I break 
 Till I break 
 I give my life to you 
 My heart to you 
 You're all I need 
 Come and make me new 
 I abandon 
 The weight of my sin 
 The weight of my loss and my pain 
 Relief swells 
 Like air in my lungs 
 And freedom releases my shame 
 My shame 
 Jesus Christ, take our lives 
 We won't waste another day 
 Holy god, fill our hearts 
 We won't ever be the same

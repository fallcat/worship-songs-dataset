Blessing, honor, strength, and power 
 Yours alone now and yours forever 
 Love this world could never stop 
 There is no one like our God 
 Reaching down to touch the broken 
 Mercy breaking through this moment 
 Faithful is the one who saves 
 Worthy is your name 
 Oh God, the Glory is yours 
 The Kingdom has come 
 And the battle is over 
 Jesus in your name we rise 
 And the glory is yours 
 The glory is yours 
 Throngs and angels watch in wonder 
 On that day when time is over 
 Every heart at last proclaim 
 "Worthy is your name!" 
 Nobody beside you 
 There has never be anyone or anything like you 
 Nobody beside you 
 There will never be anyone or anything like you

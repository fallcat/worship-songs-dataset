You left Your throne for our salvation 
 Jesus Christ, the hope of our nation 
 Battered by the weight of our nature 
 For our crimes You came to save 
 God of the world, You walked among us 
 Covered in flesh, in all of our weakness 
 You were despised, embarrassed, and lonely 
 Through Your shame we came alive 
 God be praised 
 Forever we will shout Your Name 
 Lord over all 
 You left heaven for earth 
 Your glory for us 
 Risen King be lifted high 
 Out of the dark, and into Your likeness 
 Caught in hope, a love so relentless 
 Called by name, Your sons and Your daughters 
 Bought with a price, we are alive 
 Because I'm alive, I'll give You my life 
 Because I am free, I'll bow at Your feet 
 Because I am loved, I'm able to love 
 Because I am Yours, my worth is secure

God who answers prayer 
 Sees me in my need 
 Runs to my despair 
 Your promise I believe 
 That You Are, You Are, You Are God 
 Bless the Lord with all that's within o my soul 
 I cry out with all that I am make me whole 
 Here I stand I place all my hope in you 
 My Healer will see me through 
 God who answers prayer 
 Faithful you will be 
 In my darkest hour 
 Your promise I believe 
 My Savior, my God on High 
 The One who has brought me life 
 I surrender all that I am 
 Into your hands, I'm in your hands

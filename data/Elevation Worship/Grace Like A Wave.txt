You have brought me to the water 
 Where my past can be swept away 
 In the current of your mercy 
 And I know I'll never be the same 
 There's no limit to your promise 
 Jesus you have done it all for me 
 Jesus you have done it all for me 
 Grace comes like a wave 
 Crashing over me 
 Grace comes like a wave 
 Crashing over and over and over 
 I will jump into the water 
 Where my soul can be satisfied 
 And your love is overflowing 
 From within me and it won't run dry 
 There's no limit to your promise 
 Jesus you have done it all for me 
 Jesus you have done it all for me 
 Grace comes like a wave 
 Crashing over me 
 Grace comes like a wave 
 Crashing over and over and over 
 There's healing in the water 
 With a love that flows so deep 
 Wash over me 
 Wash over me 
 Forgiveness in the water 
 With a love that flows so deep 
 Wash over me 
 Wash over me 
 Salvation in the water 
 With a love that flows so deep 
 Wash over me 
 Wash over me 
 Grace comes like a wave 
 Crashing over me 
 Grace comes like a wave 
 Crashing over and over and over

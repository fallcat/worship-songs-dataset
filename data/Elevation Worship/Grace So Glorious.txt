Beneath the cross of Jesus Christ 
 No shadow remains for shame to hide 
 Redemption shone for all to see 
 Perfection bore our penalty 
 With a grace so glorious 
 Immortal day the veil was torn 
 When mercy donned a crown of thorns 
 As law gave way to liberty 
 And freedom for humanity 
 With a grace so glorious 
 Oh the glory of the Savior's love 
 Surrounding our surrender 
 To know forever we are welcomed home 
 Crowned in glory to glory 
 Worthy is the Lord of all 
 The glory forever 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Triumphant praises without end 
 All hailing the King of righteousness 
 And every eye beholds the One 
 Our hearts were undeserving of 
 With a grace so glorious 
 O wondrous day when I will see 
 The face of Him who ransomed me 
 I'll fall in worship at His feet 
 And rise to reign eternally 
 In a grace so glorious 
 In a grace so glorious

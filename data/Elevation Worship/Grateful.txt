This is the day that You have made 
 Whatever comes, I won't complain 
 For all my hope is in Your name 
 And now Your joy awaits my praise 
 I give thanks for all You have done 
 And I will sing of Your mercy and Your love 
 Your love is unfailing 
 Lord, I am grateful 
 When I was down, You brought me out 
 You set my feet on higher ground 
 So here I stand, You are my God 
 His faithfulness, my Solid Rock 
 I give thanks for all You have done 
 And I will sing of Your mercy and Your love 
 Your love is unfailing 
 Lord, I am grateful 
 I give thanks for all You have done 
 I won't forget all the battles You have won 
 Your love is unfailing 
 Lord, I am grateful 
 And as we lift our hands 
 The heavens open, heavens open 
 So let our lives declare the love 
 Our God has spoken over us 
 And as we lift our hands 
 The heavens open, heavens open 
 So let our lives declare the love 
 Our God has spoken over us 
 I give thanks for all You have done 
 And I will sing of Your mercy and Your love 
 Your love is unfailing 
 Lord, I am grateful 
 I give thanks for all You have done 
 I won't forget all the battles You have won 
 Your love is unfailing 
 Lord, I am grateful

Your love has rescued us 
 The cross delivered all our hearts from fear 
 Our hope is here 
 You came to make a way 
 Jesus you came to raise the dead to life 
 Our song will rise 
 Oh great and mighty King 
 You reign in majesty 
 Before Your throne we sing 
 Holy holy 
 Oh great and mighty King 
 For all eternity 
 We bow with heaven and sing 
 Holy holy 
 What do we have to bring 
 This is our offering, our hearts before 
 The risen Lord 
 All power in Your Name 
 Jesus the one who saves, be lifted high 
 Our song will rise 
 Oh great and mighty King 
 You reign in majesty 
 Before Your throne we sing 
 Holy holy 
 Oh great and mighty King 
 For all eternity 
 We bow with heaven and sing 
 Holy holy 
 Your glory fills this place 
 We shout unending praise 
 Forever hallelujah 
 Forever hallelujah 
 Oh great and mighty King 
 You reign in majesty 
 Before Your throne we sing 
 Holy holy 
 Oh great and mighty King 
 For all eternity 
 We bow with heaven and sing 
 Holy holy

A Savior arises 
 Courage in the distance 
 Our hearts can feel You rising 
 A stirring hope within us 
 You're calling out for us 
 We hear Your voice cut through the darkness 
 You're calling out for us as we cry out for love 
 Greater than our sin 
 A greater love begins 
 Through the power of Your cross 
 Your love is great in us 
 You've taken all our shame 
 You've washed it all away 
 Through the power of Your cross 
 Your love is great in us 
 Your love spends the distance 
 All our sin forgotten 
 You're calling us to follow 
 You're stirring hope within us 
 You're calling out for us 
 We hear Your voice cut through the darkness 
 You're calling out for us as we cry out for love 
 Greater than our sin 
 A greater love begins 
 Through the power of Your cross 
 Your love is great in us 
 You've taken all our shame 
 You've washed it all away 
 Through the power of Your cross 
 Your love is great in us 
 Greater than my hurt 
 Greater than my pain 
 Greater than my hopes 
 And all my dreams 
 Greater than my past 
 Greater than my doubt 
 Greater than my life 
 Your love for me 
 (x2) 
 Greater than our sin 
 A greater love begins 
 Through the power of Your cross 
 Your love is great in us 
 You've taken all our shame 
 You've washed it all away 
 Through the power of Your cross 
 Your love is great in us 
 A greater love in us 
 A greater love in us 
 A greater love in us 
 (x2)

Great is the lord and greatly to be praised 
 Great are your works in all the earth 
 The skies declare the glory of your name 
 The heavens tell of your great worth 
 And now we join and sing 
 Father, we bless your name 
 You are holy 
 We cry with everything that's in us 
 Singing the praises of our glorious 
 Our hearts are bowed before your majesty 
 We worship you our king

Thank You for the wilderness 
 Where I learned to thirst for Your presence 
 If I'd never known that place 
 How could I have known You are better? 
 Thank You for the lonely times 
 When I learned to live in the silence 
 As the other voices fade 
 I can hear You calling me, Jesus 
 And it's worth it all just to know You more 
 You've done great things 
 Jesus, Your love never fails me 
 My soul will sing you have done great things 
 Thank You for the scars I bear 
 They declare that You are my healer 
 How could I have seen your strength 
 If You never showed me my weakness? 
 And it's worth it all, just to know You more 
 You've done great things 
 Jesus, Your love never fails me 
 My soul will sing You have done great things 
 You've done great things 
 In weakness, You are my victory 
 My soul will sing You have done great things 
 Through the fire and the flood You have never let me go 
 And my soul sing You have done great things 
 I am weak, You are strong 
 You will always be my hope 
 And my soul will sing You have done great things 
 Through the fire and the flood You have never let me go 
 And my soul will sing You have done great things 
 I am weak, You are strong 
 You will always be my hope 
 And my soul will sing You have done great things 
 You've done great things 
 Jesus, Your love never fails me 
 My soul will sing You have done great things 
 You've done great things 
 In weakness, You are my victory 
 My soul will sing You have done great things

Give thanks to the Lord for he is good 
 Come and see what he has done 
 Can you feel this move of God 
 Breaking on our shores 
 Who is like our God 
 Whose kindness never ends 
 Who is like our King 
 Whose fame and glory reign 
 There is victory in our hearts today 
 Everyone has seen the Lord has done great things 
 God is on the move, kingdom come to earth 
 Everyone has seen the Lord has done great things 
 Our hearts rejoice for we have won 
 Nothing can withstand 
 The mighty power of the cross 
 The One who conquered death 
 Who is like our God 
 Whose kindness never ends 
 Who is like our King 
 Whose fame and glory reign 
 Come and see what he has done

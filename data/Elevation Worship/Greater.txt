God, our strength, God, our savior 
 God, our hope 
 Yours forever is the glory, the honor 
 God, our shield, God, our shelter, God, our rock 
 Yours forever is the glory, the honor 
 The victory and power 
 You're greater, greater 
 There's no one like our God 
 You alone are worthy 
 God, you are greater, greater 
 There's no one like our king 
 All the earth is singing 
 "God you are greater" 
 You are, you are 
 God, you are greater 
 You are, you are 
 God, our peace, God, our father, God, our rest 
 Yours forever is the glory, the honor 
 The victory and power 
 You're greater, greater 
 There's no one like our god 
 You alone are worthy 
 God, you are greater, greater 
 There's no one like our king 
 All the earth is singing 
 "God, you are greater" 
 You are, you are 
 God you are greater 
 You are, you are 
 You have overcome the world 
 Took the keys from death and hell 
 Joining heaven we declare 
 You're greater, greater 
 You're greater, greater 
 There's no one like our god 
 You alone are worthy 
 God, you are greater, greater 
 There's no one like our king 
 All the earth is singing 
 God, you are greater, greater 
 There's no one like our god 
 You alone are worthy 
 God, you are greater, greater 
 There's no one like our king 
 All the earth is singing 
 "God, you are greater" 
 You are, you are 
 God, you are greater 
 You are, you are

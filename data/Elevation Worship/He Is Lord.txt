Again the wind is raging 
 But I will not be shaken 
 For I know who's in control 
 The greater One within me 
 Is more than what's against me 
 He's in control, for I know 
 He'll see me through like before 
 He is Lord, He is Lord 
 I'm not afraid anymore 
 He is Lord, He is Lord 
 The One who holds tomorrow 
 Is calling me to follow 
 Heart and soul, I will go 
 The Maker of the promise 
 Will finish what He started 
 Heart and soul, I will go 
 He'll see me through like before 
 He is Lord, He is Lord 
 I'm not afraid anymore 
 He is Lord, He is Lord 
 And at His name the mountains bow 
 Lift every voice declare it now 
 Jesus Christ is Lord 
 And with a shout the walls come down 
 Lift every voice declare it now 
 Jesus Christ is Lord 
 And at His name the mountains bow 
 Lift every voice declare it now 
 Jesus Christ is Lord 
 And with a shout the walls come down 
 Lift every voice declare it now 
 Jesus Christ is Lord 
 He'll see me through like before 
 He is Lord, He is Lord 
 I'm not afraid anymore 
 He is Lord, He is Lord 
 He'll see me through like before 
 He is Lord, He is Lord 
 I'm not afraid anymore 
 He is Lord, He is Lord

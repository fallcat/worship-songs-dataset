Here I lay my burdens down 
 Lose my worries in Your love 
 Casting every care on You 
 I have carried them enough 
 We're not alone 
 Here within His love 
 Emmanuel 
 He is still with us 
 When the world becomes too much 
 Near the cross I will remain 
 Until every fear is stilled 
 At the mention of Your name 
 We're not alone 
 Here within His love 
 Emmanuel 
 He is still with us 
 We're not alone 
 Here within His love 
 Emmanuel 
 He is still with us 
 Mercy is falling falling 
 Lift up your hands receive it now 
 Here in the presence of the Lord 
 Mercy is falling, falling 
 Lift up your hands, receive it now 
 Here in the presence of the Lord 
 I know your past is broken 
 You can move on, it's over now 
 Here in the presence of the Lord 
 I know your past is broken 
 You can move on, it's over now 
 Here in the presence of the Lord 
 Tired of running, running 
 Be still and know He's in control 
 Here in the presence of the Lord 
 Pour out your heart before Him 
 Open your arms, He'll hold you now 
 Here in the presence of the Lord 
 Pour out your heart before Him 
 Open your arms, He'll hold you now 
 Here in the presence of the Lord 
 Mercy is falling, falling 
 Lift up your hands, receive it now 
 You're in the presence of the Lord

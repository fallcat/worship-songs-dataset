Hold on to me 
 I am weak without you 
 I can't breathe without you 
 But I can make it through 
 If you hold on to me 
 When my heart is broken 
 Still your arms are open 
 Your love can make me new 
 You are my everything 
 I run into your name 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 I know my world is safe 
 Forever in your name 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 My God is stronger 
 He won't let go of me 
 Christ my savior 
 Faithful through eternity

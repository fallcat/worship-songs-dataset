You left your glory 
 To join in our story 
 You came to redeem us 
 'Cause we were in need of you 
 To bring your salvation 
 You took up our cross and we cry 
 Holy is the one 
 Who gave his only son for us 
 We were dead in sin 
 You gave us life and made us whole again 
 We are the redeemed 
 The ones who are free 
 Freed in your name, God 
 We lift up a shout 
 Our praise is loud 
 Our praise is loud

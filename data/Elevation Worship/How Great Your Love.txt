Oh the cross of Christ 
 Where love came for us 
 You pursued our hearts, you pursued us 
 In the Son of God 
 The perfect sacrifice 
 There's rescue for our hearts, rescue for us 
 We will lift our voice for all you've done 
 All you've done for us 
 Whoa, how great your love for us 
 Glory to our God 
 You have brought us home 
 You forgave our hearts 
 You forgave us 
 We will lift our voice for all you've done 
 All you've done for us 
 Whoa, how great your love for us 
 We are loved, we are loved 
 Hallelujah our shame is gone 
 We are loved, we are loved 
 Hallelujah, love has won 
 Whoa, how great your love for us

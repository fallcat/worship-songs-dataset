In the fall you were there 
 Grace began before I was aware 
 The shame to great for me to hide 
 Covered now because of Jesus Christ 
 I can't believe 
 The price you paid for me 
 What you did not owe so that I could know you 
 How can it be 
 You chose someone like me 
 To declare your praise for the glory of your name 
 To the one who gave it all 
 I belong with all my heart and soul 
 And every gain I count as loss 
 When I survey the wonder of the cross 
 You gave your life upon the cross 
 To make your home within my heart 
 Oh what a faithful God you are 
 Your praise forever in my heart

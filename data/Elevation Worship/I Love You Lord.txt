Your Patience was amazing waiting while my heart was wondering 
 Your kindness is surprising as I stumble home you run to me 
 I'm welcomed with rejoicing wrapped in the embrace of royalty 
 And now I'm overflowing, singing of the love I have received 
 I love you lord 
 I lo-ove you lord 
 Jesus I adore you 
 I love you lord 
 I lo-ove you lord 
 Teach me how to love you more 
 You crown me with compassion, lifting up my hands to see your smile 
 I know you are for me, as us fill my heart with your desire 
 It goes beyond my feelings, flooding to the places I can't see 
 And now I'm overflowing singing of the love I have received 
 I love you lord 
 I lo-ove you lord 
 Jesus I adore you 
 I love you lord 
 I lo-ove you lord 
 Teach me how to love you more 
 A love that will not let me go, my soul will rest in you alone 
 I give you back this life I owe, to know you Jesus more and more 
 I love you lord 
 I lo-ove you lord 
 Jesus I adore you 
 I love you lord 
 I lo-ove you lord 
 Teach me how to love you more

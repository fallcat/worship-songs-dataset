 Surrender every anxious thought for perfect peace, your perfect peace 
 All the loved one's I hold dear 
 All my hopes and dreams and all my fears

 I will bow down to tell you that I need You 
 Jesus Lord of all 
 Jesus Lord of all

 You are my strength, you are my strength 
 I will look up for there is none above you 
 I will bow down to tell you that I need You 
 Jesus Lord of all 
 Jesus Lord of all 
 I will look back and see that you are faithful 
 I look ahead believing you are able 
 Jesus Lord of all 
 Jesus Lord of all

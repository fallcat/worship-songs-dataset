When I wander in my doubt 
 I'm held within your mystery 
 You reveal a love so faithful 
 Hope unending 
 I believe 
 You're the risen Son of God 
 You're the light that breaks the dark 
 Your love has rescued me 
 Forever I will sing 
 You're the Savior of my soul 
 You're the name above it all 
 Your grace alive in me 
 Forever I will sing 
 Oh the wonder of the cross 
 The Father's heart revealed to me 
 Unrelenting, never changing 
 All consuming, I am free 
 I am not ashamed of the cross that made a way 
 The only name that saves is Jesus

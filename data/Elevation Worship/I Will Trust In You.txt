Lord, I come 
 Draw me closer 
 Hear my prayer 
 I surrender to you 
 Every day 
 You sustain me 
 Make a way 
 I surrender to you 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 'Cause you're all I need 
 You are all I need 
 All I have 
 Is all you need God 
 Everything 
 Is what I'm bringing to you 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 'Cause you're all I need 
 You are all I need 
 All I have for your glory Jesus 
 All I am for your kingdom, your name 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 'Cause you're all I need 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 I will trust in you 
 'Cause you're all I need 
 You are all I need 
 You are all I need, Jesus

Wake up the wonder, our redemption's glory 
 Now is the time for strength to rise 
 Shake off the failure we are moving forward 
 Now is the time for strength to rise 
 We shall proclaim, unto the one who saves 
 Jesus forever we crown you with praise 
 We shout the name, that will break every chain 
 Jesus forever we crown you with praise 
 Raise up your banner, we are marching onward 
 Now is the time for strength to rise 
 Lift up the Savior, He is fighting for us 
 Now is the time for strength to rise 
 Our God alone is deserving our praise 
 He's the one who is seated forever to reign 
 Our hands are lifted and our voices raised 
 To the one who is seated forever to reign 
 Glory and honor and power and strength 
 To the One who is seated forever to reign 
 Sing hallelujah and lift up the name 
 Of the One who is seated forever to reign 
 Forever we crown you with praise 
 Forever we crown you with praise

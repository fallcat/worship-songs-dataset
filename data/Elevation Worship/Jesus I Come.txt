Oh how I need your grace 
 More than my words can say 
 Jesus I come 
 Jesus I come 
 In all my weaknesses 
 You are my confidence 
 Jesus I come 
 Jesus I come 
 I will rise and stand redeemed 
 Heaven open over me 
 To your name eternally 
 Endless glory I will bring 
 Oh what amazing love 
 Beneath your cleansing flood 
 Jesus I come 
 Jesus I come 
 In every broken place 
 You are my righteousness 
 Jesus I come 
 Jesus I come 
 Thank you Jesus 
 Just as I am I come 
 Hallelujah 
 Oh what amazing love

May your kingdom come 
 Your will be done 
 On earth as it is in heaven 
 For yours is the kingdom 
 The power and glory 
 Forever you reign, forever you reign 
 Let hope swell in our lives 
 And we will be the Church 
 To live out your heart 
 Oh God arise up in us 
 We'll show the world how you love 
 Jesus, take our heart and make it yours 
 Salvation reign over us 
 The fight was won on the cross 
 We take heart, for you have overcome the world 
 Raise your hopeful voices 
 Make a joyful noise and 
 Sing unto the King of Glory

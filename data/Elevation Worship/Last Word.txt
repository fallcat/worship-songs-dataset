The storm rises from the deep 
 And rages around me 
 But I will remember 
 When doubt wars within my heart 
 The battle almost lost 
 I will remember 
 You have the last word 
 It is finished 
 You have the last word 
 It is finished 
 My fear is silenced in your love 
 My hope is endless 
 Your voice that calmed the violent sea 
 Speaks courage over me 
 So I will remember 
 The words that wake the sun to rise 
 Are breaking through my night 
 I will remember 
 Your word stands through the ages 
 Your voice shatters the darkness 
 In you we are more than conquerors 
 You speak and strongholds surrender 
 Your name overcomes the enemy 
 In you we are more than conquerors

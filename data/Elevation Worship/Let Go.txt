Search me, oh God 
 Know every part 
 Let nothing I have 
 Keep me from Your heart 
 Surrendered I come 
 With open hands 
 I give You my life 
 And all that I am 
 'Cause Your love is better 
 Than anything this world has to offer 
 Than anything this world has to give 
 So I let go, I leave it all behind 
 Let go, I'm taking up Your life 
 All for Your name 
 Even if it costs me everything 
 Show me Your way 
 Guide me in truth 
 The life that I found 
 In You is better 
 Than anything this world has to offer 
 Than anything this world has to give 
 So I let go, I leave it all behind 
 Let go, I'm taking up Your life 
 All for Your name 
 Even if it costs me everything 
 I surrender all 
 I surrender all to Jesus 
 (x4) 
 Lord I surrender (x3) 
 So I let go, I leave it all behind 
 Let go, I'm taking up Your life 
 All for Your name 
 Even if it costs me everything 
 (x2) 
 I will let go of the world I know (x4)

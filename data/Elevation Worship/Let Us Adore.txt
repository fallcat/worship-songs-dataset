For the unclean, the unholy 
 For the broken, the unworthy 
 You came, Jesus you came 
 For the wounded, for the hurting 
 For the lost, and for the lonely 
 You came, Jesus you came 
 O come all ye faithful 
 Bow before our savior 
 Come let us adore 
 The one who came for us 
 Glory in the highest 
 Praise the name of Jesus 
 Our king has come 
 For the outcast, the defeated 
 For the weary, for the weakest 
 You came, oh Jesus you came 
 O come all ye faithful 
 Bow before our savior 
 Come let us adore 
 The one who came for us 
 Glory in the highest 
 Praise the name of Jesus 
 Our king has come 
 O come let us adore him 
 For he alone is worthy 
 Our king has come 
 Our king has come 
 O give him all the glory 
 For he alone is worthy 
 Our king has come 
 Our king has come 
 O come all ye faithful 
 Bow before our savior 
 Come let us adore 
 The one who came for us 
 Glory in the highest 
 Praise the name of Jesus 
 Our king has come 
 O come all ye faithful 
 Bow before our savior 
 Come let us adore 
 The one who came for us 
 Glory in the highest 
 Praise the name of Jesus 
 Our king has come

We cry and You hear us 
 Your hand lifts us out 
 Your love never fails us 
 We're desperate for You, Lord 
 Desperate for You, Lord 
 You call us out of the darkness 
 You are the lifter of our hands 
 We look to You, we look to You 
 You raise us out of the ashes 
 You are the God who never fails 
 We look to You, we look to You 
 Our fears will not drown us 
 Your hand pulls us out 
 We fall but You're with us 
 We can't escape Your love 
 Can't escape Your love 
 You call us out of the darkness 
 You are the lifter of our hands 
 We look to You, we look to You 
 You raise us out of the ashes 
 You are the God who never fails 
 We look to You, we look to You 
 We'll fall into You 
 We'll hold on to You 
 You won't let us go 
 You call us out of the darkness 
 You are the lifter of our hands 
 We look to You, we look to You 
 You call us out of the darkness 
 You are the lifter of our hands 
 We look to You, we look to You 
 You raise us out of the ashes 
 You are the God who never fails 
 We look to You, we look to You

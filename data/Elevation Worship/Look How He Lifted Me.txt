My world was shaking 
 My heart was broken 
 My hope was fading 
 The walls were closing in 
 But now I'm singing 
 Look how He lifted me 
 My life was sinking 
 My days were numbered 
 The waves were crashing 
 The flood was coming in 
 Oh hallelujah 
 Look how He lifted me 
 Look how He lifted me 
 His grace and mercy is my testimony 
 For every victory 
 I've got a song to sing 
 Look how He lifted me 
 He turned my mourning 
 Back into dancing 
 He turned my weeping 
 Into a shout again 
 And now I'm singing 
 Look how He lifted me 
 He rolled my sorrows 
 Away at Calvary 
 He rose in triumph 
 Over the enemy 
 Oh hallelujah 
 Look how He lifted me 
 When nothing else could help 
 Your love came down 
 Your love came down 
 When nothing else could help 
 Your love came down 
 And lifted me

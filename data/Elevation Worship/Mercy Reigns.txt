My God is strong enough to raise me from the grave 
 Your love is great enough to take away my shame 
 Your mercy reigns 
 My God is making new the wreckage of my heart 
 Your hand is reaching down to pull me from the dark 
 Your mercy reigns 
 Your mercy covers me 
 Your grace sustains 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Your spirit is my strength to overcome the past 
 I set my eyes on you and find a grace that lasts 
 I'm forgiven, washed inside a love that never lets go 
 You never let go

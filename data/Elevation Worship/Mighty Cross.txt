On the day that death surrendered 
 To the mighty cross of Jesus Christ 
 The earth would shake beneath the weight 
 Of darkened skies 
 On His brow, a crown of sorrow 
 For a King whose weakness was our strength 
 No word He spoke, His love was shown 
 For all to see 
 Oh the cross of Jesus Christ 
 He's the reason I'm alive 
 For His blood has set me free 
 It will never lose its power for me 
 Now the dawn of resurrection 
 Floods the night as hope prevails to shine 
 Salvation wakes, our chains to break 
 And we arise 
 Oh the cross of Jesus Christ 
 He's the reason I'm alive 
 For His blood has set me free 
 It will never lose its power for me 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ my victory 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 He has won for me 
 On the day, He comes in glory 
 To reveal the fullness of His reign 
 Our hearts will bow, before the sound 
 Of Jesus name 
 Oh the cross of Jesus Christ 
 He's the reason I'm alive 
 For His blood has set me free 
 It will never lose its power for me 
 Oh the cross of Jesus Christ 
 He's the reason I'm alive 
 For His blood has set me free 
 It will never lose its power for me 
 It will never lose its power for me 
 It will never lose its power for me

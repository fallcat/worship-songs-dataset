You call us out from the depths 
 Into your freedom 
 Our chains are gone 
 No weapon formed shall prevail 
 Your word is stronger 
 We overcome 
 Your glory resounds through the age 
 All saints declaring 
 Your great renown 
 Your kingdom forever will stand 
 We won't be shaken 
 We will not fear 
 Our God a mighty warrior 
 You're a consuming fire 
 In victory you reign 
 We triumph in your name 
 Jesus the great commander 
 You conquered death forever 
 In victory you reign 
 We triumph in your name 
 And we declare your name is power 
 Exalted one no name is higher 
 You stand alone our strong defender 
 Above you there's no other, above you there's no other

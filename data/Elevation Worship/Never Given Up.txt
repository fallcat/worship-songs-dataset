You're love is unending 
 No matter where I've been 
 And the depths of Your grace 
 Covers all my mistakes 
 It wipes away my sin 
 You gave yourself for me 
 To show you adore me 
 And how precious Your love 
 Covers all that I've done 
 And still Your pursuing 
 You have never given up 
 Never given up 
 You run to me 
 You have never given up 
 Never given up 
 You catch me 
 We know, You will never let us go 
 Our hope, we will never be alone

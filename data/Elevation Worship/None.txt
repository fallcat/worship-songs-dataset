You are the One who knows my need 
 Before I call 
 You tell the storm when it will cease 
 Before it starts 
 The God of all who searches deep 
 Within my heart 
 The highest praise cannot proclaim 
 How great You are 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus 
 No sacrifice can now repay 
 The debt I owe 
 Or earn this gift of righteousness 
 That was Your own 
 Still I will give myself away 
 To make You known 
 The Name above all other names 
 Is Yours alone 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus 
 Everlasting, everlasting 
 Name above all 
 Jesus You are the 
 Everlasting, everlasting 
 Name above all 
 Jesus You are the 
 Everlasting, everlasting 
 Name above all 
 Jesus You are the 
 Everlasting, everlasting 
 Name above all! 
 Jesus You are 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus 
 There is none like You, none like You 
 The faithful One, Jesus

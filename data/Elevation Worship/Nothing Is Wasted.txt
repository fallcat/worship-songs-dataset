You know my every need 
 You see my poverty 
 You are enough for me, Jesus 
 You gave the blind man sight 
 You raised the dead to life 
 You've done the same for me, Jesus 
 You are loving, You are wise 
 There is nothing in my life You cannot revive 
 You are loving, You are wise 
 There is nothing too hard for our God 
 Your word inside of me 
 My strength, my everything 
 My hope will always be Jesus 
 Your breath inside my lungs 
 You're worthy of my trust 
 You will forever be Jesus 
 You are loving, You are wise 
 There is nothing in my life You cannot revive 
 You are loving, You are wise 
 There is nothing too hard for our God 
 Nothing is wasted 
 You work all things for good 
 Nothing is wasted 
 Your promise remains 
 Forever You reign 
 Nothing is wasted 
 You work all things for good 
 Nothing is wasted 
 Your promise remains 
 Forever You reign 
 Your promise remains 
 Forever You reign 
 You are loving, You are wise 
 There is nothing in my life You cannot revive 
 You are loving, You are wise 
 There is nothing too hard for our God 
 Nothing is wasted 
 You work all things for good 
 Nothing is wasted 
 Your promise remains 
 Forever You reign 
 Your promise remains 
 Forever You reign 
 Your promise remains 
 Forever You reign

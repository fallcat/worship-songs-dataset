Our God, a firm foundation 
 Our rock, the only solid ground 
 As nations rise and fall 
 Kingdoms once strong now shaken 
 But we trust forever in your name 
 The name of Jesus 
 We trust the name of Jesus 
 You are the only King forever 
 Almighty God we lift you higher 
 You are the only King forever 
 Forevermore, you are victorious 
 Unmatched in all your wisdom 
 In love and justice you will reign 
 Every knee will bow 
 We bring our expectations 
 Our hope is anchored in your name 
 The name of Jesus 
 We trust the name of Jesus 
 We lift our banner high 
 We lift the name of Jesus 
 From age to age you reign 
 Your kingdom has no end

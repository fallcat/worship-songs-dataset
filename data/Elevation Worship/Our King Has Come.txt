Image of God 
 Who walked with us 
 Took our sorrows 
 Carried our cross 
 You were broken 
 Death for life 
 Love has spoken 
 Opened our eyes 
 Now we can see 
 Now we believe 
 Your love has made a way 
 Our King has come 
 So let us sing 
 Salvation's song 
 Of victory 
 He is alive and we are free 
 He is alive and we have found our peace 
 Our King has come 
 Risen Savior 
 Son of God 
 Brought redemption 
 Covered our lives 
 Christ reigns 
 Christ reigns 
 Our God has conquered the grave

Now the darkness fades 
 Into new beginnings 
 As we lift our eyes to a hope beyond 
 All creation waits 
 With an expectation 
 To declare the reign of the Lord our God 
 We will not be moved 
 When the earth gives way 
 For the risen One has overcome 
 And for every fear 
 There's an empty grave 
 For the risen One has overcome 
 Now the silence breaks 
 In the name of Jesus 
 As the heavens cry let the earth respond 
 All creation shouts 
 With a voice of triumph 
 To declare the reign of the Lord our God 
 We will not be moved 
 When the earth gives way 
 For the risen One has overcome 
 And for every fear 
 There's an empty grave 
 For the risen One has overcome 
 He shall reign forever 
 Strongholds now surrender 
 For the Lord our God has overcome 
 Who can be against us? 
 Jesus our Defender 
 He is Lord and He has overcome 
 He shall reign forever 
 Strongholds now surrender 
 For the Lord our God has overcome 
 Who can be against us? 
 Jesus our Defender 
 He is Lord and He has overcome 
 We will not be moved 
 When the earth gives way 
 For the risen One has overcome 
 And for every fear 
 There's an empty grave 
 For the risen One has overcome 
 We will not be moved 
 When the earth gives way 
 For the risen One has overcome 
 And for every fear 
 There's an empty grave 
 For the risen One has overcome

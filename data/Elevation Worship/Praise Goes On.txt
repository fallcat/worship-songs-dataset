Here in your light we find 
 What makes us come alive 
 A sacrifice of praise 
 A city on a hill 
 Surrendered to your will 
 Your glory on display 
 Awesome in this place 
 Jesus you are awesome in this place 
 Worthy to praise, Jesus you will be praised 
 You will be praised 
 Your love a force of grace 
 Consuming every spare 
 It's uncontainable 
 You're coming like a flood 
 Our hearts are filling up 
 All things are possible, all things are possible 
 Your praise goes on and on forever more 
 We lift the name of Jesus 
 Your kingdom come 
 Is what we're living for 
 We lift the name of Jesus

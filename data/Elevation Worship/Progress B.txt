spoken: 
 You serve a God 
 You were made by a God 
 No matter how far you've drifted 
 No matter how hard you've run 
 No matter how many bad alliances you've made 
 No matter how hopeless it seems 
 No matter how enslaved you are 
 You serve a God, a good God 
 Who can turn your mistake into a miracle 
 Hallelujah 
 You serve a God who can turn your mistake into a miracle 
 Who can make the sun to stand still in your life

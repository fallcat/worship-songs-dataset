Precious compassion that pours 
 From the wounds that have won our salvation 
 Sin was strong but the savior is stronger 
 Come let us worship him 
 Great was the debt that we owed 
 And how high was the price of our healing 
 Paid in full by the one who is worthy 
 Come let us worship him 
 Raised to life with Christ the savior 
 In his name a new creation 
 Now our song will rise 
 Adoring Christ the lord 
 Death overcome by the word 
 That was spoken before it was finished 
 Jesus saves is our song everlasting 
 Come let us worship him 
 Raised to life with Christ the savior 
 In his name a new creation 
 Now our song will rise 
 Adoring Christ the lord 
 Sin was strong 
 But Jesus is stronger 
 Our shame was great 
 But Jesus you're greater 
 Jesus you're greater 
 Raised to life with Christ the savior 
 In his name a new creation 
 Now our song will rise 
 Adoring Christ the lord 
 Sin was strong 
 But Jesus is stronger 
 Our shame was great 
 But Jesus you're greater

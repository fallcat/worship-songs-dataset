The head that once was crowned with thorns 
 Is crowned with glory now 
 The Savior knelt to wash our feet 
 Now at his feet we bow 
 The one who wore our sin and shame 
 Now robed in majesty 
 The radiance of perfect love 
 Now shines for all to see 
 Your name 
 Your name 
 Is victory 
 All praise 
 Will rise 
 To Christ our king 
 The fear that held us now gives way 
 To him who is our peace 
 His final breath upon the cross 
 Is now alive in me 
 Your name 
 Your name 
 Is victory 
 All praise 
 Will rise 
 To Christ our king 
 By Your spirit I will rise 
 From the ashes of defeat 
 The resurrected king 
 Is resurrecting me 
 In Your name I come alive 
 To declare your victory 
 The resurrected king 
 Is resurrecting me 
 The tomb where soldiers watched in vain 
 Was borrowed for three days 
 His body there would not remain 
 Our God has robbed the grave 
 Our God has robbed the grave 
 Your name 
 Your name 
 Is victory 
 All praise 
 Will rise 
 To Christ our king 
 By Your spirit I will rise 
 From the ashes of defeat 
 The resurrected king 
 Is resurrecting me 
 In your name I come alive 
 To declare Your victory 
 The resurrected king 
 Is resurrecting me 
 The resurrected king 
 Is resurrecting me

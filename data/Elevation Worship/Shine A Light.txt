Waking up to another life 
 No more sorrow and no more night 
 You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now 
 Burning bright 'cause we're not ashamed 
 Got a world to illuminate 
 You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now 
 Nothing can stand against us 
 Our praise will break the darkness 
 We declare, Your kingdom's here 
 Because our God is for us 
 We're living in the promise 
 We declare, Your kingdom's here 
 Nothing can stand against us 
 Our praise will break the darkness 
 We declare, Your kingdom's here 
 Because our God is for us 
 We're living in the promise 
 We declare, Your kingdom's here 
 Shadows fade as you now arise 
 Hope is here with no end in sight 
 You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now 
 You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now 
 Nothing can stand against us 
 Our praise will break the darkness 
 We declare, Your kingdom's here 
 Because our God is for us 
 We're living in the promise 
 We declare, Your kingdom's here 
 Shine a light, shine a light 
 Shine a light, shine a light 
 We've got a light and we're gonna shine 
 Jesus let your name be glorified 
 We've got a light and we're gonna shine 
 Forever let your name be glorified

We were lost but then you rescued us 
 Through your son, on earth you came 
 You took our guilt, you took our shame away 
 With our hands raised high 
 We shout your praise 
 Because it's by your blood, by your blood we have been saved 
 We will sing forever to you God 
 Because of your great love 
 We'll lift our lives 
 On the ground we bow before our king 
 Lifting up our hearts to you 
 The one who saved the one who took our blame 
 With our hands raised high we sacrifice 
 Because it's by your blood, by your blood we are alive 
 Our God is an awesome God he reigns 
 From heaven above with wisdom 
 Wisdom, power and love 
 Our God is an awesome, awesome God

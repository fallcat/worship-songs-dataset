We confess, you're limitless 
 Our greatest dreams could never hold 
 The measure of your power 
 We cry out, we need you now 
 God of restoration bring 
 A miracle this hour 
 You make the sun stand still 
 The oceans part, You're powerful 
 It's who you are 
 God most high, stir a fire in us 
 With your power inside 
 We won't waste our lives 
 God most high, strong and mighty in us 
 Be our passion, our prize 
 We won't waste our lives 
 Our lives ablaze, our hearts won't faint 
 For you, our God, will be our strength 
 We're living for your name 
 All things are possible 
 With our God, our God 
 Nothing is too great 
 Our God, our God (repeat)

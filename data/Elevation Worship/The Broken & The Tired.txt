When I was blind 
 You gave me sight 
 You gave me eyes to see the colors of Your sky 
 When I was deaf 
 Without a sound 
 You gave me ears to hear the sounds of Your love 
 Your love is kind 
 Your love's the only thing that's perfect in this life 
 You sent Your son to die 
 For the broken and the tired 
 And You healed my life 
 With my hands raised high 
 And my heart a burning fire 
 I'll give my life 
 To dwell in Your love 
 When I was weak 
 With tired feet 
 You gave me strength to run the race you'd given me 
 When I was numb 
 My heart grown cold 
 You gave me nerves to feel the warmth of Your love 
 Your love is kind 
 Your love's the only thing that's perfect in this life 
 Healer, we confess 
 We were lost in brokenness 
 Till You came and conquered death 
 For love 
 You sent Your son to die 
 For the broken and the tired 
 And You healed our lives 
 With our hands raised high 
 And our hearts a burning fire 
 We'll give our lives 
 To dwell in Your love

We are the church the world is waiting for 
 We've got a love the world is desperate for 
 We will lead and take to your streets 
 Now's the time for us to rise 
 And carry hope and let love shine 
 And show this world that mercy is alive 
 Now's the time for us to rise 
 And carry hope to hopeless eyes 
 And show this world that mercy is alive 
 We're not afraid. we will abandon all 
 To hear your name on lips across the world 
 We will run in the wake of your love 
 Fill our hearts with your compassion 
 Let our love be active here

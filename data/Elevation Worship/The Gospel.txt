As we were singing that song... 
 There's someone listening or watching this 
 That needs a brand new start in Jesus Christ 
 Right now, wherever you are 
 If God is drawing you to himself 
 And you felt as we were singing 
 "You are making all things new" 
 That this moment is meant to be the beginning 
 Of your new life in Christ 
 2nd Corinthians 5: 17 says 
 "That if anyone is in Christ, is a new creation 
 The old is gone and the new has come 
 Right now, whether you're in this place tonight 
 Driving down the road, watching this 
 On television, online or by DVD 
 I want to give you the opportunity to say 
 "This moment, is the moment, 
 Where Jesus Christ made all things new in my life" 
 And for the person that is tired 
 Of the same old attempts to clean up your life 
 The same old dead paths to find joy 
 Your past has haunted you 
 Your future has imparalized 
 No matter how you try, 
 You can't get it together 
 And the beauty of the Gospel is this: 
 That Jesus came so that You 
 Would not have to get it together 
 But so that you could offer him 
 The broken pieces of your fragmented life 
 Your uncertain future 
 And so that all things could be made new 
 Church let's pray together and for all of you 
 Who want to receive Jesus Christ 
 As the Lord and Savior of your life, 
 You pray this in your heart with me 
 And God will make all things new 
 This will be the beginning 
 Of the best days of your life 
 And the beginning of an eternal relationship 
 With the God who sent His Son 
 To make all things new 
 Let's pray together church and say this: 
 Heavenly Father, I need a new start 
 I need your grace, I need your mercy 
 I give my life and all of my sins 
 I turn from my own ways... To trust in you 
 Thank you Jesus, for dying for me 
 I believe you rose again, to give new life 
 I place my hope in you 
 Make me a brand new person 
 Give me a brand new start 
 And I will live for you 
 All the days of my life 
 Grace 
 Mercy 
 Salvation 
 Forgiveness 
 Hope 
 Restoration 
 This is a brand new day 
 You're a brand new person 
 You have a brand new home, in Jesus name

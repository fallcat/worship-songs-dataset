Glory to God, the Highest 
 No other name but Jesus 
 All of creation cries out 
 Glory to God, the Highest 
 Hallelujah to the King 
 Hallelujah to the King 
 Hallelujah to the King 
 Who reigns alone 
 Jesus, You're high and lifted up 
 Messiah, You're high and lifted up 
 Hosanna, Savior 
 High and lifted up

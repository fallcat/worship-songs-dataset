All our fathers saw 
 In the days of old 
 Would you do it again 
 Do it again 
 All the stories told 
 All the miracles 
 Would you do it again 
 Do it again 
 You said "Consecrate yourselves to me 
 And you will see amazing things" 
 We need Your revival 
 Holy Spirit fire 
 Burning ever brighter 
 In our souls 
 Kings and kingdoms falling 
 Hear your people calling 
 King of Kings we need a miracle 
 There's a time to sow 
 And a time to reap 
 Would you do it again 
 Do it again 
 There's a time to heal 
 And a time to build 
 Would you do it again 
 Do it again 
 The King is among us 
 And His glory surrounds us 
 And His fire is falling as we sing 
 The Savior is for us 
 And His love is victorious 
 And revival is rising in His name

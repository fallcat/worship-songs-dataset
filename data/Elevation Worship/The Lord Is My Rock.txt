When the waters rise 
 My hope is sure 
 When my world falls apart 
 I stand secure 
 When my way is dark 
 Your light breaks through 
 When I don't feel you near 
 Your word is true 
 Jesus your love surrounds me 
 You're holding my life 
 Holding my life 
 The Lord is my rock 
 And I won't be afraid 
 I won't be afraid 
 You're with me 
 When the waters rise 
 My hope is sure 
 When my world falls apart 
 I stand secure 
 Oh God you carry us 
 You rise above 
 You lift us up

By his wounds we are healed 
 By his stripes we're made whole 
 Body broken for us 
 For our sin to atone 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Perfect lamb that was slain 
 Once for all to redeem 
 Perfect love took our place 
 Now forever we'll sing 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Oh the love of Jesus 
 Oh the love of Jesus 
 Oh the love of Jesus 
 Is enough for me 
 Author of all my hope 
 Keeper of all my days 
 Jesus you go before 
 Your grace has made a way 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Your strength in my weakness 
 Your word lights my darkness 
 Your peace everlasting 
 Singing holy, holy is our God

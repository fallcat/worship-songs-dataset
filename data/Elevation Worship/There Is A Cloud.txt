Hear the word roaring as thunder 
 With a new future to tell 
 For the dry season is over 
 There is a cloud beginning to swell 
 To the skies, heavy with blessing 
 Lift your eyes, offer your heart 
 Jesus Christ opened the heavens 
 Now we receive the Spirit of God 
 We receive Your rain 
 We receive Your rain 
 Every seed buried in sorrow 
 You will call forth in its time 
 You are Lord, Lord of the harvest 
 Calling our hope now to arise 
 We receive Your rain 
 We receive Your rain 
 We receive Your rain 
 We receive Your rain 
 Like a flood, like a flood 
 We receive Your love 
 When You come 
 Like a flood, like a flood 
 We receive Your love 
 When You come 
 Like a flood, like a flood 
 We receive Your love 
 When You come 
 Like a flood, like a flood 
 We receive Your love 
 And with great anticipation 
 We await the promise to come 
 Everything that You have spoken 
 Will come to pass, let it be done 
 We receive Your rain 
 We receive Your rain 
 We receive Your rain 
 We receive Your rain

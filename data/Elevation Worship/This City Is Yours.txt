This city, Lord, it is yours 
 So break our hearts, break our hearts 
 For the people who are far from you 
 Break our hearts 
 Teach us to love, the way you loved us 
 Send us out, send us out 
 Pour out your fire, and flow through our lives 
 Send us out, send us out 
 The heart in my chest, it is beating so fast 
 I can hardly contain all the hope in my veins 
 As I see you alive in this city arise 
 Like the sun shining bright 
 We see darkness and night run from our lives 
 This city, Lord, it is yours 
 Teach us to love, the way you loved us 
 Send us out, send us out 
 Pour out your fire, and flow through our lives 
 Send us out, send us out 
 We'll take to the streets with fire in our hearts 
 Send us out, send us out

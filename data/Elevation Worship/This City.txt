We come together and we stand as one 
 With You forever 
 You tell us that You'll keep Your promise 
 And finish what You started 
 This revolution now it's starting 
 And running through the streets 
 And pouring through the city 
 Redemption's calling 
 Calling us to come alive 
 Our hearts on fire 
 For the people in our lives 
 We won't burn out, we won't stop till 
 This city knows who you are I 
 And we'll be Your love in this city 
 We will live for Your love in this city 
 We will be Your heart in this city 
 We will live for Your heart in this city x2

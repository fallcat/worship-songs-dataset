Faithful in the waiting You are 
 Always faithful in the valley You are 
 Faithful in the midst of hurt and pain 
 You are faithful 
 Your promises remain 
 Forever and ever 
 You won't fade away 
 You never, You never change 
 You're unchanging God 
 You will never change 
 You're unchanging God 
 Mighty in the battle You are 
 Always with me, You're the God who overcomes 
 Mighty You will raise me from the grave 
 You are mighty 
 Your promises remain 
 Forever and ever 
 You won't fade away 
 You never, You never change 
 You're unchanging God 
 You will never change 
 You're unchanging God 
 Oceans will rise, 
 Kingdoms will fall 
 But the word of the Lord stands forever 
 The sun will start to fade, 
 The world will pass away 
 But the word of the Lord stands forever 
 And the death will try to come 
 The perfect love is won 
 Cause the word of the Lord stands forever 
 The word of the Lord stands forever 
 Forever 
 Your promises remain 
 Forever and ever 
 You won't fade away 
 You never, You never change 
 You're unchanging God 
 You will never change 
 You're unchanging God 
 You will never change 
 You're unchanging God 
 Your kingdom is forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 All glory, all honor 
 Unto our God forever

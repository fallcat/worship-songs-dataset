I was going down, thought it was for the count 
 But then I found Your love 
 I'd wandered off, thought I ain't gone too far 
 There I found Your love 
 The fear I used to know, can't tie me anymore 
 'Cause I found Your love 
 When I feel alone, I have a place to go 
 'Cause I found Your love 
 Great, was the debt of sin 
 Grace, bought me back again 
 Now, I am rising up 
 Won, by the Saviour's love 
 Your love, is higher than the stars 
 Declaring who You are 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love, is deep enough to reach 
 The deepest part of me 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love 
 The fear I used to know, can't tie me anymore 
 'Cause I found Your love 
 When I feel alone, I have a place to go 
 'Cause I found Your love 
 Great, was the debt of sin 
 Grace, bought me back again 
 Now, I am rising up 
 Won, by the Saviour's love 
 Your love, is higher than the stars 
 Declaring who You are 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love, is deep enough to reach 
 The deepest part of me 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing contains Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing can change Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing contains Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing can change Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing contains Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing can change Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing can contains Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing can change 
 Your love, is higher than the stars 
 Declaring who You are 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love, is deep enough to reach 
 The deepest part of me 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love, is higher than the stars 
 Declaring who You are 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love, is deep enough to reach 
 The deepest part of me 
 Your love, uncontainable 
 Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing contains Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing can change Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing contains Your love 
 Nothing, no nothing can change Your love

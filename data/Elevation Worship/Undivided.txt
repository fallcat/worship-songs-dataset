This is the time 
 This is the hour 
 When I make my stand 
 There's no turning back 
 For Your kingdom is all that I want 
 Illuminate my heart 
 Pierce the dark 
 Until all is laid bare 
 Every hidden part 
 For Jesus You're all that I want 
 All that hinders I cast aside 
 Undivided 
 Here's my heart 
 It is Yours, It is Yours 
 Undivided 
 Take my life 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 This is the time 
 This is the hour 
 When I make my stand 
 There's no turning back 
 For Your kingdom is all that I want 
 All that hinders I cast aside 
 Undivided 
 Here's my heart 
 It is Yours, It is Yours 
 Undivided 
 Take my life 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 With open hands I come 
 With an open heart I come 
 Everything is Yours 
 I'm ready, I'm ready to let go 
 Take all of me, take all of me

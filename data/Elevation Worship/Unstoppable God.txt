Heaven thundered and the world was born 
 Life begins and ends in the dust you formed 
 Faith commanded and the mountains moved 
 Fear is losing ground to our hope in you 
 Unstoppable God 
 Let your glory go on and on 
 Impossible things 
 In your name they shall be done 
 Freedom conquered, all our chains undone 
 Sin defeated, Jesus has overcome 
 Mercy triumphed when the third day dawned 
 Darkness was denied when the stone was gone 
 Nothing shall be impossible 
 Your kingdom reigns unstoppable 
 We'll shout your praise forevermore 
 Jesus, our God unstoppable

Love undeserved and unheard of 
 As majesty left heaven's throne 
 Your riches exchanged for a cross 
 You carried for us 
 Matchless in gracious compassion 
 Mighty in power to save 
 Clothed in the sorrows of sin 
 For the glory of our God 
 For the glory of our God 
 Unto your name 
 Jesus on high 
 Be glorified 
 No other name 
 Jesus alone 
 Savior of all

 Together declare your grace so amazing 
 You alone are good

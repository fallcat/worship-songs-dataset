Your grace came for us 
 Your hope secured us 
 We'll never lose the love that You gave 
 The blood of Jesus, the blood that freed us 
 Has conquered death and made away 
 There is no condemnation of those in You 
 There's only freedom in Your name 
 You've overcome 
 Love has won 
 Our God reigns victorious 
 No other name has power to save 
 Jesus Christ alive in us 
 The power of Jesus 
 Your spirit in us 
 Is strong enough to overcome 
 There is no condemnation of those in You 
 There's only freedom in Your name 
 You've overcome 
 Love has won 
 And our God reigns victorious 
 No other name has power to save 
 Jesus Christ alive in us 
 My shame is gone 
 My heart set free 
 Through Christ alone you rescued me x4 
 You've overcome 
 Love has won 
 And our God reigns victorious 
 No other name Has power to save 
 Jesus Christ alive in us 
 Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh x2 
 We will overcome we will overcome 'cause 
 You have overcome the world x4

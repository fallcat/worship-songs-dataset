Light broke through 
 It was you 
 It began to rise inside of me 
 As you breathed in peace 
 Hallelujah 
 We were bought we were bought with love 
 So we walk we walk in love 
 You're calling us out of ourselves 
 To love a world that's broken down 
 So we walk in love 
 Wake up soul 
 You've been made whole 
 It's Christ in you who's shining through 
 When you give love away 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah hallelujah 
 We will love we will love we will be your love 
 You will shine you will shine you will shine in us 
 We will love we will love we will walk in love

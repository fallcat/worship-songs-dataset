You came to change the world 
 You came, it was the only way for us to be restored 
 You came to make us new 
 You came to warm our dying hearts and bring us back to You 
 And when You came, You broke our chains 
 And You lifted us out of our graves 
 We are alive because You died 
 You buried our shame, when you rose from the grave 
 You became man, and You conquered our sin 
 So we'll live this life to celebrate, celebrate Your name 
 Verse: You came to save the world 
 You came because You loved enough to fix what we destroyed 
 You came into our hearts 
 We were falling down until You came and rescued us 
 We are alive because You died 
 You buried our shame, when you rose from the grave 
 You became man, and You conquered our sin 
 So we'll live this life to celebrate, celebrate Your name

After we had fallen 
 You opened up our hearts 
 And spoke in truth 
 The bags we had to carry 
 They were getting heavy 
 But not for you 
 You took up our crosses 
 And you cut all our losses 
 And paid for our freedom in you 
 We are forgiven, covered by the blood 
 Of a son who was given up for us 
 We are your children, adopted in a love 
 That could take all our mess and make us clean 
 The darkness now behind us 
 Our hope inside a promise 
 You never leave 
 You brought us to the light God 
 And told us "It's alright child 
 Rest in me" 
 Hallelujah, we are free, we are free

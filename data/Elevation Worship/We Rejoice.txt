Our God is with us 
 And we will not forget 
 That You're fighting for us 
 Who can stop the work of your hand 
 We've seen redemption 
 At the heartbeat of our church 
 We've seen addictions 
 Broken in the hope of your love 
 Broken in the hope of your love 
 We rejoice, we rejoice for You have come 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel, our king has come 
 You saw us running 
 But You wouldn't let us go 
 Cause You saw our story 
 Ending in the arms of Your son 
 We'll run into the arms of Your son 
 We Sing, we shout 
 Cause in our city You have moved 
 Our God, You came to us

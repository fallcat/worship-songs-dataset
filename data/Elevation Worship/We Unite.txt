You are rising up 
 Your heart burns in us 
 Let justice fall, let justice fall 
 Setting captives free 
 Calling us to be 
 Your hands and feet 
 We unite for your kingdom's cause 
 So that hope will fall 
 Over all... 
 We unite for your kingdom's sake 
 So that love will reign 
 Above all... you reign above all 
 You're the God of hope 
 Calling us to go 
 And be your love 
 We need your love 
 Justice for the weak 
 For the least of these 
 Break our hearts 
 Hear the heart of Christ for us 
 A call to love, a call to love 
 Hear the Son of God rejoice 
 As people (we all) love, we all love

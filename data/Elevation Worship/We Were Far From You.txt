Before time began 
 The world was never meant 
 To carry all our sin 
 Before we ran away 
 And lost what you had made 
 You planned to take our place 
 On the cross 
 You died so we could be alive 
 And you sought to bring us home 
 We were far from you 
 And nothing in this world could fill us up 
 But you brought us back 
 Before we could come 
 And kneel before your throne 
 You had to send your son 
 You saw us in our need 
 You came to make us clean 
 You bled to set us free 
 On the cross 
 You died so we could be alive 
 And you fought to bring us home 
 Filled with your love 
 It's Christ in us 
 Freed by the blood of your son

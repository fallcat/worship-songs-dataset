Though our hands are tired 
 Our eyes they look to You 
 Even in the dark 
 We will follow after You 
 Our hearts are hopeful 
 Our faith believing 
 We're not alone 
 You are here 
 Your promise tells us 
 You're always with us 
 We're not alone 
 You are here 
 When the ground is dry 
 Our hope remains in You 
 Even in our pain 
 We believe that You will move 
 Our hearts are hopeful 
 Our faith believing 
 We're not alone 
 You are here 
 Your promise tells us 
 You're always with us 
 We're not alone 
 You are here 
 You hear our prayer 
 You see our need 
 Nothing is too hard for our God 
 So we will move 
 Our faith in You 
 Nothing is too hard for our God 
 Nothing is too hard for our God 
 Our hearts are hopeful 
 Our faith believing 
 We're not alone 
 You are here 
 Your promise tells us 
 You're always with us 
 We're not alone 
 You are here 
 We're not alone 
 We're not alone 
 Nothing is too hard for our God

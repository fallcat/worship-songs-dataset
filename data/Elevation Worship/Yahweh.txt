Spirit of Jesus 
 Living within us 
 Never to fail or forsake 
 Unending promise 
 Heaven inside us 
 Whispers the sound of Your name 
 Holy 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Worthy to be praised 
 Yahweh 
 Fire rising in my soul 
 All consuming flame 
 Yahweh 
 Filled with Your wonder 
 Here I surrender 
 Held in Your mystery of grace 
 Calling me closer 
 Waking desire 
 Coming alive in Your name 
 Holy 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Worthy to be praised 
 Yahweh 
 Fire rising in my soul 
 All consuming flame 
 Yahweh 
 He who was and is to come 
 Is the One who lives in us 
 The great I am 
 Yahweh 
 Holy 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Worthy to be praised 
 Yahweh 
 Fire rising in my soul 
 All consuming flame 
 Yahweh

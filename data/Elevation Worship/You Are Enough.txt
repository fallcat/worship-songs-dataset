My highest joy 
 Love of my heart 
 You are 
 All that's good 
 Flows from your mercy 
 To us 
 Here's my heart 
 Make it yours 
 I will sing 
 If I lose it all 
 You're enough 
 If I gain the world 
 You're enough 
 My joy is complete 
 Jesus you are enough for me 
 Jesus you are enough for me 
 Empty we came 
 You gave your grace 
 To us 
 When riches fade 
 Still you remain 
 Our God 
 You can take my life 
 And all I have 
 I will sing your worth 
 With all I am 
 (The hope I've found) 
 You're all I need 
 You're everything 
 Jesus you are enough for me

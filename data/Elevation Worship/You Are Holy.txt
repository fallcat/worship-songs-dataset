Grow our faith Lord 
 When our eyes can't see 
 That you don't change Lord 
 You will ever be 
 All glory and honor and praise 
 To the king who forever reigns 
 Holy, You are Holy 
 Worthy, You are Worthy 
 Without an end, You are the same 
 Without an end, God you remain 
 Above all thrones, Above every name 
 Without an end, God you remain

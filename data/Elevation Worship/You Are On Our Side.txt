You promised salvation 
 To bring your children home 
 You promised redemption 
 That your love would restore 
 We can see you all around 
 This is the day 
 This is the time 
 When all you spoke 
 Has come alive 
 We've seen you move 
 We've seen you fight 
 We've seen it all cause you are on our side 
 You promised our city 
 Would be shaken with your love 
 You promised Your Spirit 
 Would change the world through us 
 For your glory, your fame Lord 
 We surrender our lives

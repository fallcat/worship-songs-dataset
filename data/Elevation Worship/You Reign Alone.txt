There is no one greater than You 
 All our praise belongs to You 
 Holy in power, faithful and true 
 There is none like You 
 There is no one stronger than You 
 Sin forever conquered by You 
 Fearless in life, faithful in death 
 There is none like You 
 Lord You reign, You reign alone 
 Exalted over all the earth enthroned 
 The majesty and greatness of Your Name 
 Let all creation sing, Lord You reign 
 There is none more loving than You 
 Near to all who call out to you 
 Your mercies are new, you're faithful and true 
 There is none like You 
 No one is higher than the King above all nations 
 No one is like You God 
 The Name of Jesus is higher than any other 
 No one is like You God

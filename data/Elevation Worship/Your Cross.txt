My soul has come alive now 
 The grave has lost its grip on me 
 I'm free by the cross 
 I'm free 
 My shame is gone forever 
 The chains have lost their hold on me 
 I'm free by the cross 
 I'm free 
 The blood of Jesus has now redeemed us 
 We lift our voices 
 We shout out louder 
 Jesus your cross has saved us 
 Our God has risen 
 Your power in us 
 Jesus your cross has saved us 
 Love awakened my heart 
 My eyes are open now I see 
 I'm free by the cross 
 I'm free 
 All glory 
 All praise belongs to you 
 Who gave it all for me

Your favor follows me 
 Your kindness leads me to a hope I cannot see 
 Faithful are you father to fulfill your every promise 
 The desires of my heart are made complete 
 Cause your favor follows me 
 I'll give you everything I have 
 I'll give you everything I have 
 'Cause I was undeserving 
 And you chose me

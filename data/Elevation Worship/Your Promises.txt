When the weight of life begins to fall 
 On the name of Jesus I will call 
 For I know my God is in control 
 And His purpose is unshakable 
 Doesn't matter what I feel 
 Doesn't matter what I see 
 My hope will always be 
 In your promises to me 
 Now I'm casting out all fear 
 For your love has set me free 
 My hope will always be 
 In your promises to me 
 As I walk into the days to come 
 I will not forget what you have done 
 For you have supplied my every need 
 And your presence is enough for me 
 You will always be more than enough for me 
 You will always be more than enough for me 
 Nothing's gonna stop the plans you've made 
 Nothing's gonna take your love away 
 You will always be more than enough for me

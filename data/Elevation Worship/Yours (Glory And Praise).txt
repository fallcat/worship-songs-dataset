It all revolves 
 Around Your throne 
 Who can know Your glory? 
 So high above 
 Yet slain for us 
 You alone are worthy 
 And the praise is Yours 
 And the praise is Yours 
 You're the One we bow before 
 Reigning over us 
 As we lift You up 
 You will reign forevermore 
 The One who was 
 And is to come 
 God of every moment 
 Forever crowned 
 Exalted now 
 You alone are holy 
 And the praise is Yours 
 And the praise is Yours 
 You're the One we bow before 
 Reigning over us 
 As we lift You up 
 You will reign forevermore 
 And the praise is Yours 
 And the praise is Yours 
 You're the One we bow before 
 Reigning over us 
 As we lift You up 
 You will reign forevermore 
 Reign forevermore 
 We lift You up 
 Glory and praise 
 Power and strength 
 Worthy is the Lamb of God 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory and praise 
 Power and strength 
 Worthy is the Lamb of God 
 Hallelujah

 Worthy is the Lamb of God

 And the praise is Yours 
 And the praise is Yours 
 You're the One we bow before 
 Reigning over us 
 As we lift You up 
 You will reign forevermore 
 And the praise is Yours 
 And the praise is Yours 
 You're the One we bow before 
 Reigning over us 
 As we lift You up 
 You will reign forevermore 
 Glory and praise

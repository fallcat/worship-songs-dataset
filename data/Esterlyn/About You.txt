Take, take, take it away 
 All these little things that I fear in me 
 A child like fear takes a hold of me 
 But it's all the same 
 See its good for me 
 I wait, wait, wait for the day 
 When I'll be the son that sees that way 
 A memory paints that face again 
 Feeling people's pain through your own skin 
 Feelings they come, feelings they go 
 Faith brings together what we don't know 
 I wish this world could see the way 
 You know that love could be 
 There's something about, something about you 
 That I want, I want 
 There's something about, something about you 
 That's what I want 
 Give, give, give it away 
 Your time your heart and your life for me 
 You're the man that I want to be and you show his love 
 God's love for me 
 Feelings they come, feelings they go 
 Faith brings together what we don't know 
 I wish this world could see the way 
 You know that love could be 
 There's something about, something about you 
 That I want, I want 
 There's something about something about you 
 That's what I want 
 Religion before God is to love 
 Spirit keep on shining through you 
 There's something about, something about you 
 There's something about, something about you 
 That's what I want 
 There's something about something about you 
 That I want, I want 
 There's something about, something about you 
 That's what I want

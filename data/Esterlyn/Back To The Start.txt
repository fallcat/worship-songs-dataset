Separate sides, your separated thoughts now 
 Did you ask yourself the reason why again? 
 Generations come, and generations go and you know (oh, oh) 
 This is the way, this is the way it goes again 
 And it seems to bring you down 
 You're pushing, you're pushing hard again 
 And you'll find your way if you look today 
 You still, you still forget the person you are 
 Just give it one more chance 
 You're only moving back to the start, oh 
 So come on now, you've got to fall in place 
 Take your hands to scrub the guilt off your dirty face 
 Before your eyes close shut and your ears can't hear 
 Are you listening? Are you listening? 
 This is the way, this is the way it goes again 
 And your fiction brings you down 
 You're fading fast, l you're fading fast again 
 So find your way and look today 
 You still, you still forget the person you are 
 Just give it one more chance 
 You're only moving back to the start 
 It's time 
 Open your heart 
 It's over now 
 You can turn around 
 You still, you still forget the person you are 
 Just give it one more chance 
 You're only moving back to the start 
 You still, you still forget the person you are 
 Just give it one more chance 
 You're only moving back to the start

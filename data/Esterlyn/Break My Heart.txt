You hear the cry that can't be heard 
 You see the heart that's filled with hurt 
 You know the name of every unknown orphan child 
 Oh, Lord of compassion 
 Please help me to see 
 Your love for this world 
 Could shine through me 
 Break my heart 
 And give me yours 
 Break my heart, my heart 
 Give me yours 
 Break my heart, my heart 
 Give me yours 
 You give you grace to those in need 
 You break the chains, set captives free 
 You heal the pain of every broken hearted home 
 Oh, Lord of compassion 
 Please help me to see 
 Your love for this world 
 Could shine through me 
 Break my heart 
 And give me yours 
 Break my heart, my heart 
 Give me yours 
 Break my heart, my heart 
 Give me yours 
 Let my heart always beat 
 With this love that I seek 
 I wanna be your hands and feet 
 To give your hope to those in need 
 So let my heart always beat 
 With this love that I seek 
 I wanna be your hands and feet 
 To give your hope to those in need 
 So break my heart 
 And give me yours 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Break my heart, my heart 
 Give me yours 
 Break my heart, my heart 
 Give me yours 
 Break my heat, my heart 
 Give me yours 
 Break my heart, my heart 
 Give me yours

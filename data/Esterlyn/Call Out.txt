Close your eyes and take a breath 
 Hope that life will give you rest 
 Lift your eyes up to the night 
 Let the fire be your guide 
 The dawn will come, light will sing 
 Call out, call out wherever you are 
 Call out, call out when it's all crashing down 
 From the top of your lungs 
 Let your voice rise up 
 Call out, call out 
 Its difficult to say goodbye to the hurt inside 
 The tears that we hide 
 Oh, empty spaces will mend in time 
 Flooding with love and we sing 
 Call out, call out wherever you are 
 Call out, call out when it's all crashing down 
 From the top of your lungs 
 Let your voice rise up 
 And call out, call out 
 Calling out to you 
 Oh, calling out to you 
 Oh, yeah 
 Call out, call out wherever you are 
 Call out, call out when it's all crashing down 
 From the top of your lungs 
 Let your voice rise up 
 Call out, call out 
 Call out, call out wherever you are 
 Call out, call out when it's all crashing down 
 From the top of your lungs 
 Let your voice rise up 
 Call out, call out

My heart is on fire watching it burn 
 Could this be You speaking now 
 This road is too long, dreams have been passed 
 I need this grace to last so this is life 
 But give me a sign 
 Will You show me what I'm living for? 
 I can't miss this 
 My heart beats and yearns for something more 
 I am listening 
 This future's a strain watching it flow 
 Could this be You leading now 
 The truth has been said, holding it tight 
 I need this to be right so this is life 
 Give me a sign 
 Will You show me what I'm living for? 
 I can't miss this 
 My heart beats and yearns for something more 
 I am listening, oh 
 I hear Your voice in the night 
 Your truth has brought new life 
 And will You open the sky 
 To hope that lives inside 
 Will You show me what I'm living for? 
 I can't miss this 
 Will You show me what I'm living for? 
 I can't miss this 
 My heart beats and yearns for something more 
 I am listening, oh, I am listening

When I'm feeling lonely, when I am afraid 
 I'll call to You, Jesus 
 There's power in Your name 
 I'll come to You 
 Lord I'm crying out to You 
 Here I am, El Shaddai 
 I give You the glory 
 I lift You on high 
 Here I am, El Shaddai 
 You gave me Your Son 
 I'll give You my life 
 I'll give You my life 
 When I am discouraged 
 When I see my shame 
 I'll call to You Jesus 
 There's powering in Your name 
 I'm calling to You 
 Yeah, I'm crying out to You 
 Here I am, El Shaddai 
 I give You the glory 
 I lift You on high 
 Here I am, El Shaddai 
 You gave me Your Son 
 I'll give You my life 
 I'll give You my life 
 To You oh Lord, Hallelujah 
 To You oh Lord, Hallelujah 
 To You oh Lord, Hallelujah 
 To You oh Lord, Hallelujah 
 So here I am, El Shaddai 
 I give You the glory 
 I lift You on high 
 Here I am, El Shaddai 
 You gave me Your Son 
 I'll give You my life 
 I'll give You my life 
 El Shaddai 
 We lift You on high

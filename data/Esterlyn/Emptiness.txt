The emptiness is taking me 
 My spirit is still yelling 
 While the voice still pleads within my soul 
 Give me purpose 
 In reality I've been so numb 
 It's the opposite that I've become 
 While your second chances finally find me hanging on 
 The sun is setting, this night is ending 
 Oh howI tried, but I still haven't changed, haven't changed a thing about me 
 When I look around, I feelthe world without 
 I see the tension it's reaching, it's reaching proudly for what has been lost 
 The emptiness is taking me 
 My spirit is still yelling 
 While the voice still pleads within my soul 
 Give me purpose 
 In reality I've been so numb 
 It's the opposite that I've become 
 While your second chances finally find me hanging on 
 You forgave me from the start 
 When you open up my heart 
 I want to know that brilliantly 
 You gave me all your love 
 And you give your love 
 And you give your love 
 And you give your love 
 The emptiness is taking me 
 My spirit is still yelling 
 While the voice still pleads within my soul 
 Give me purpose 
 In reality, I've been so numb 
 It's the opposite that I've become 
 While your second chances finally find me hanging on

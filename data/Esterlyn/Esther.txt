He heals the brokenhearted 
 He binds their wounds 
 He is love 
 He finds those forgotten 
 Those who've been abused 
 He is love 
 He knows your name 
 A father to the fatherless 
 A healer of the brokenness 
 You've make beauty from the ashes 
 And You're a helper to the helpless 
 A fighter for the hopeless 
 You love those who are alone 
 Those who are alone 
 He comforts the lonely and hears their cry 
 He is love 
 He holds our children throughout the night 
 He is love 
 He knows your name 
 A father to the fatherless 
 A healer of the brokenness 
 You've make beauty from the ashes 
 And You're a helper to the helpless 
 A fighter for the hopeless 
 You love those who are alone 
 Those who are alone 
 And give us Your heart, Lord 
 Help us love the unseen 
 And give us Your eyes, Lord 
 Help us love those in need 
 You're a father to the fatherless 
 A healer of the brokenness 
 You've make beauty from the ashes 
 You're a helper to the helpless 
 A fighter for the hopeless 
 You love those who are alone 
 Those who are alone 
 He knows your name 
 He knows your name

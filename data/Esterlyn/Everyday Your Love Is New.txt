I find myself with my feet off the path again 
 Seeking love from a place that will always end 
 Oh Jesus raise a wildfire in my heart 
 Feel the pull to wonder 
 I wonder everyday 
 I need Your love to lead me 
 Show me the way 
 We sing out, we seek Your face 
 Pour out Your grace 
 Everyday Your love is new 
 Everyday You make me new 
 We sing out, we sing Your praise 
 With healed hearts we say 
 Everyday Your love is new 
 Everyday You make me new 
 It's a fight that we're all gonna have to face 
 To live a life where we're nothing apart from grace 
 Oh Jesus make our will Your very own 
 We feel the pull of wonder 
 We wonder everyday 
 We need Your love to lead us 
 To show us thw way 
 We sing out, we seek Your face 
 Pour out Your grace 
 Everyday Your love is new 
 Everyday You make me new 
 We sing out, we sing Your praise 
 With healed hearts we say 
 Everyday Your love is new 
 Everyday You make me new 
 Forgive us forgive us 
 From where we have fallen 
 And fill us, fill us with Your presence 
 Renew a steadfast spirit Lord within us 
 We sing out, we sing Your praise 
 With healed hearts we say 
 Everyday Your love is new 
 Everyday You make me new 
 We sing out, we seek Your face 
 Pour out Your grace 
 Everyday Your love is new 
 Everyday You make me new 
 We sing out, we sing Your praise 
 With healed hearts we say 
 Everyday Your love is new

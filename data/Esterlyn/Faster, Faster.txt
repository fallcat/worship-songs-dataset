I felt the cold seeping through my door as she's walking by 
 We talked for hours talked about her choices wrong and right 
 She was so all alone the image in her mind was grey 
 A sorrow and a blade is all that she has left to say 
 Faster, faster 
 Won't You make this better (whoa) 
 Forgot thefeeling screaming for You (whoa) 
 I can't believe the choices we make 
 Creates everything that we now hate 
 Faster, faster won't You make this better (whoa) 
 The numbness feels her bones she's fighting feeling dreading home 
 She can't break away from the lies she's been told she's been told (she's been told) 
 Remembering all her pain this time her lips were fast asleep 
 Suddenly she lifts her eyes up to the one who makes her breathe 
 Faster, faster 
 Won't You make this better (whoa) 
 Forgotthefeeling screaming for You (whoa) 
 I can't believe the choices we make 
 Creates everything that we now hate 
 Faster, Faster won't You make this better (whoa) 
 I'm still crying at the top of my lungs the top my lungs 
 I'm still crying at the top of my lungs the top my lungs 
 I'm still crying at the top of my lungs the top my lungs 
 (Cast your cares cast your cares believe that He's still there) 
 I'm still crying at the top of my lungs the top my lungs 
 (Cast your cares cast your cares believe that He's still there) 
 Faster, faster 
 Won't You make this better (whoa) 
 Forgot the feeling screaming for You (whoa) 
 I can't believe the choices we make 
 Creates everything that we now hate 
 Faster, Faster won't You make this better (whoa)

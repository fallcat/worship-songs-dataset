The future comes alive 
 You speak Your word and I 
 Am running into Your hope 
 Because I've seen Your light 
 You bring my world to life 
 I'm coming after Your love 
 'Cause I'm not shaken 
 I'm not letting go 
 And everything comes alive in my life 
 As we lift You higher 
 Let Your freedom arise in our lives 
 As we lift You up 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Freedom is here 
 So take the limits off 
 No matter what the cost 
 I'm running after Your call 
 And I will run this race 
 See you face to face 
 Let Your power overflow 
 'Cause I'm not shaken 
 I'm not letting go 
 And everything comes alive in my life 
 As we lift You higher 
 Let Your freedom arise in our lives 
 As we lift You up 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Freedom is here, Your freedom is here 
 I will not fear 
 I will not hide Your love, Your love 
 All of my life 
 I cannot deny Your love 
 And everything comes alive 
 In my life as we lift You higher 
 Let Your freedom arise in our lives 
 As we lift You up 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Freedom is here, Your freedom is here 
 Freedom is here 
 Your freedom is here

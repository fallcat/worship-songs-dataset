My heart is 
 Growing cold 
 I need you Lord 
 Light a 
 Fire in my soul 
 I need you Lord 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus we need your power 
 Move like a mighty wind 
 We are awakening 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus you're our desire 
 Breathe in us life again 
 We are awakening 
 Without you 
 I am weak 
 Come fill me Lord 
 Your Spirit 
 Is all I need 
 Come fill me Lord 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus we need your power 
 Move like a mighty wind 
 We are awakening 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus you're our desire 
 Breathe in us life again 
 We are awakening 
 We're awakening 
 Holy Spirit 
 Come fill us now, Holy Spirit 
 Come fill us now 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus we need your power 
 Move like a mighty wind 
 We are awakening 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus you're our desire 
 Breathe in us life again 
 We are awakening 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus we need your power 
 Move like a mighty wind 
 We are awakening 
 Fill us with Holy Fire 
 Jesus you're our desire 
 Breathe in us life again 
 We are awakening

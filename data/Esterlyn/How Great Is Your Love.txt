The seasons are forgot 
 I found myself alone 
 In the Shadow of my past 
 Where a broken reed won't last. 
 It took me by surprise 
 The day I felt demise 
 A value I held high 
 Now lost into the night 
 As heaven is above us 
 And east is far west 
 How great is Your love for us 
 How vast is Your great love? 
 My mind is wearing thin 
 In my brokenness and sin 
 I know you say I'll change 
 But inside I feel the same 
 I close my eyes this time 
 To feel your heart in mine 
 I just want to be someone 
 That truly loves your Son. 
 As heaven is above us 
 And east is far west 
 How great is Your love for us 
 How vast is Your great love? 
 It's Your love 
 It's what I need x2 
 As heaven is above us 
 And east is far west 
 How great is Your love for us 
 How vast is Your great love?

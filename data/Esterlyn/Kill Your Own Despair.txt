And something's gotta give, this world's still whispering 
 It's a cycle in your mind, it's the faith you left behind 
 When you open up your eyes, all you see is lies 
 The beauty arrayed outside, fades with the world you'll find 
 And when it's all said and done you know that there's never enough 
 You fight for all the things you want (you want) but you know it's not enough 
 To keep yourself alive, all your dreams just fade away 
 So open your eyes let beauty reign 
 He'll heal your heart, He'll change your name 
 You'll have a love again, you'll have a love again 
 The feeling of you breathing air will kill your own despair 
 Feel like you've gone to far it's not the person you are 
 You say you want to change but then you turn away 
 I've seen this all before I'm praying all for you and there's a place for you (for you) 
 For you! 
 So open your eyes let beauty reign 
 He'll heal your heart, He'll change your name 
 You'll have a love again, you'll have a love again 
 The feeling of you breathing air will kill your own despair 
 But there's still time to change your mind 
 To change your mind 
 Grace will hand you a flower in the moment that you ask her 
 She'll take what you have broken 
 Just remember when you asked is there anybody out there? 
 (Anybody out there) out there, out there 
 So open your eyes let beauty reign 
 He'll heal your heart, He'll change your name 
 You'll have a love again, you'll have a love again 
 The feeling of you breathing air will kill your own despair 
 If you open your eyes let beauty reign 
 He'll heal your heart, He'll change your name 
 You'll have a love again, you'll have a love again 
 The feeling of you breathing air will kill your own despair

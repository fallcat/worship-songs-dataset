Ten-twenty, north twenty-third, this winter won't end 
 Cold's been creeping its way inside 
 This world without color finds a place on this street 
 To uncover this beauty in me 
 This life can be different 
 This life could be more 
 To take what's been given 
 To give even more 
 This life can be different 
 Forget what we know 
 It's not enough 
 Just to breathe anymore 
 To breathe anymore 
 Movement speaks to the still 
 Leaves have fallen with time 
 Walking forward while falling behind 
 In spite of this mind 
 I give You this moment in time 
 I'm ready to make things right 
 This life can be different 
 This life could be more 
 To take what's been given 
 To give even more 
 This life can be different 
 Forget what we know 
 'Cause It's not enough 
 Just to breathe anymore 
 To breathe anymore 
 I give You this moment 
 I give you this dream 
 I give you this feeling 
 So help me believe 
 That You are the only beauty in me 
 This life can be different 
 This life could be more 
 To take what's been given 
 To give even more 
 This life can be different 
 Forget what we know 
 It's not enough 
 Just to breathe anymore 
 This life can be different 
 Forget what we know 
 'Cause It's not enough 
 Just to breathe anymore

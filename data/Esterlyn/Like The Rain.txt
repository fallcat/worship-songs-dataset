This burden is heavy 
 It's getting too heavy for me 
 I tried to bear the weight 
 But it's helpless, you see 
 I've come to the end 
 I've come to need reprieve 
 I've come to the end of me 
 I want to feel You like the rain, like the rain upon my face 
 Let the clouds, let the clouds bring down Your grace 
 Will You fill my soul with the light of each new day, yeah 
 Oh hear my prayer 
 Won't you give ear to my cry 
 I've fallen again 
 Tears won't leave my eyes 
 When will I realize I'm living without You? (without You) 
 I want to feel You like the rain, like the rain upon my face 
 Let the clouds, let the clouds bring down Your grace 
 Will You fill my soul with the light of each new day 
 The stars in the sky, they fall by Your word 
 They echo the power of You 
 You hold the world in the palm of Your hand 
 Yet You let me understand Your love 
 I want to feel You like the rain, like the rain upon my face 
 Let the clouds, let the clouds bring down Your grace 
 Will You fill my soul with the light of each new day 
 I want to feel You like the rain, like the rain upon my face 
 Let the clouds, let the clouds bring down Your grace 
 Will You fill my soul with the light of each new day

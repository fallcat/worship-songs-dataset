Lord, you see the weak in me 
 I'm lost without your mercy 
 I need you to set me free 
 To walk me through this valley 
 Your love 
 Is never gonna let us down 
 With love 
 Nothing can stop us now 
 With all that I could ever want 
 There's only one thing that I need 
 To fill my heart with your love 
 To let you be a light in me 
 So give me love 
 It's all I need 
 You give me love 
 It's all I need 
 Your love 
 Is never gonna let us down 
 With love 
 Nothing can stop us now 
 Your love 
 Is never gonna let us down 
 With love 
 Nothing can stop us now 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 I am lost 
 Without love 
 I am lost 
 Without love 
 Your love 
 Is never gonna let us down 
 With love 
 Nothing can stop us now 
 Your love 
 Is never gonna let us down 
 With love 
 Nothing can stop us now

If you're lost in a heartache on your own, oh 
 And if you're caught in a mistake and all alone, oh 
 If your soul is searching out 
 And your whole world's turned around, oh 
 If your faith is burning out 
 And love leaves you in doubt 
 And you know there's something more 
 Come to me now, lay your burdens down 
 Come rest in my arms 
 Feel my love abound 
 Come to me now, lay your burdens down 
 Come rest in my arms 
 You were lost, now you're found 
 When you're feeling forgotten on your own 
 When your soul is searching out 
 And your whole world's turned around 
 If your faith is burning out 
 And love leaves you in doubt 
 And you know there's something more 
 Come to me now, lay your burdens down 
 Come rest in my arms 
 Feel my love abound 
 Come to me now, lay your burdens down 
 Come rest in my arms 
 You were lost, now you're found 
 Come as you are, just as you are 
 I'll give you peace 
 Come to me now, lay your burdens down 
 Come rest in my arms 
 Feel my love abound 
 Come to me now, lay your burdens down 
 Come rest in my arms 
 You were lost but now you're found 
 Oh, now you're found 
 Oh, now you're found 
 Oh, now you're found, oh

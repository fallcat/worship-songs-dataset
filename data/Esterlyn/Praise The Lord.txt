When my heart is heavy 
 My spirit's weak 
 I'll lift my eyes 
 My hope is gone 
 I feel alone 
 I'll lift my eyes 
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul 
 Praise the Lord 
 Beauty for the ashes 
 Good news to the poor 
 You comfort the lonely 
 You open wide those prison doors 
 You give joy for sadness 
 You cause the blind eyes to see 
 Oh, Jesus you've been a good friend to me 
 So praise Him 
 All you saints 
 Praise Him with your heart 
 Praise Him sun and moon 
 Praise Him all you stars of light 
 Let's praise 
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul 
 Praise the Lord

Oh Lord, You're my shepherd 
 I shall not want 
 You make me lie down 
 In green pastures 
 Oh lead me 
 Beside still waters 
 Though I walk the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil 
 For You are with me 
 You are the one, the one who comforts me 
 You are help, You are hope 
 There's none like You 
 Oh Lord You're my healer 
 You restore my soul 
 You lead me in mercy to hear Your voice 
 Oh speak Lord and I will follow 
 Though I walk the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil 
 For You are with me 
 You are the one, the one who comforts me 
 You are help, You are hope 
 There's none like You 
 All of the days of my life 
 I will dwell in Your house forever 
 Though I walk the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil 
 For You are with me 
 You are the one, the one who comforts me 
 You are help, You are hope 
 There's none like You 
 There's none like You

Shadows all around 
 I hear the sound 
 Where I'm afraid to be 
 Don't let me down 
 I want to feel You surround 
 'Cause I fear that I'm drowning inside the dark 
 I want to love You now with every emotion 
 Not holding back anymore 
 I want to see You like I loved you for the first time (the first time) 
 Reveal Your love to me 
 Reveal Your love to me 
 Still not all right 
 I'm failing tonight 
 So help me believe 
 Let me see 
 I see you surround 
 So lead me 
 Lead me into Your light 
 I want to give You all the pain I've kept inside of me 
 Not just words anymore (Not just words anymore) 
 I want to need You now with every emotion (emotion) 
 Reveal Your love to me 
 Reveal Your love to me 
 I long for You to drive me to the place where I find You 
 Restoring me, guiding me, cleansing me, You make me new 
 I need you, I want You, I live for You 
 Reveal Your love to me 
 Reveal Your love to me 
 Reveal Your love to me 
 Reveal Your love to me

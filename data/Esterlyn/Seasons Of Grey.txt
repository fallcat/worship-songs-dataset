And I waited for the desperation 
 I waited at the other side 
 I waited for you to cross the line, 
 Cross the line this time 
 I noticed the reflection 
 I saw the doubt was in your mind 
 And you forgot the promise 
 The promise is inside 
 Finding a way, finding a way 
 Love is bleeding for you, and we're 
 Finding a way, to live today 
 Love is facing towards you 
 The image in the mirror, 
 Is darker than your greatest fear 
 The fear of failure, the fear of fate, 
 The fear of what you've grown to hate 
 It burns inside, oh it burns inside 
 Let go of what you've wasted and let go of what you hate! 
 Finding a way, finding a way 
 Love is bleeding for you, and we're 
 Finding a way, to live today 
 Love is facing towards you 
 Away, yourself, with what, with what it could be, you let, the sun, go down on you and me, the fear, is heavier than what you can bear, and love will lighten this season of grey 
 Finding a way, finding a way 
 Love is bleeding for you, and we're 
 Finding a way, to live today 
 Love is facing towards you 
 (It's overrun now, we'll take it somehow, forget the past and forget what you've left behind, you know you knew now, forget it somehow, so put a smile on your face)

I can see the Spirit move again 
 Stirring hearts and calling us within 
 You are greater in purpose than we've known 
 Seeing this world with his eyes 
 The Lord is gracious and full of compassion 
 The Lord is good to all 
 Slow to anger and great in mercy 
 The Lord is good to all 
 The Lord is good to all 
 The Lord is good to all, yeah 
 I can hear the mountains cry out 
 In praise to the God of Israel 
 I hear it all in those who call His name 
 We lift our hands to the sky 
 The Lord is gracious and full of compassion 
 The Lord is good to all 
 Slow to anger and great in mercy 
 The Lord is good to all 
 The Lord is good to all 
 The Lord is good to all, to all 
 Even when I fail and I'm overwhelmed 
 You have still been my faithful 
 I remember who You are 
 Even when I can't see the path ahead 
 You will still lead me to the end 
 I remember who You are 
 The Lord is gracious and full of compassion 
 The Lord is good to all 
 Slow to anger and great in mercy 
 The Lord is good to all 
 The Lord is good to all 
 The Lord is good to all

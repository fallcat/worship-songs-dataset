I hear it in your voice 
 Dreams are slowing down 
 Turning pages hear you saying this is still your choice 
 I see it in your eyes the weight of compromise 
 Treading water feeling farther then a last goodbye 
 And we all feel down need to be found 
 Found for the first time 
 Sometimes it's hard I know where you are 
 If you fail to see this mystery 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 True love is here calling you near 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 See it for the first time 
 Innocence was lost the taste was bittersweet 
 Lured into the cage tell me was it worth the cost 
 The day is almost done I'm praying that you'll find 
 That forgiveness is upon us brilliant as the sun 
 And we all feel down need to be found 
 Found for the first time 
 Sometimes it's hard I know where you are 
 If you fail to see this mystery 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 True love is here calling you near 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 See it for the first time 
 If you fail to see this mystery 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 True love is here calling you near 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 So don't fail to see this mystery 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 Give up the fight come home tonight 
 Won't you see it for the first time 
 See it for the first time

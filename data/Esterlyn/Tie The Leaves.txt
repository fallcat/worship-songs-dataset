We keep on putting these efforts into this 
 It appears we've chosen to impress those who believe-- 
 Those who believe everything is just all right, 
 But within we know we're scared to be ourselves 
 This time, this time, 
 Can we get it right now? 
 Finally make it right now 
 We seem to fight for what we are not 
 And then pass it through a lie 
 Tie the leaves on trees so they 
 Won't come down, so they won't come down 
 This time, this time, 
 Can we get it right? 
 They told us now, it wouldn't be too long 
 But it's not too much to fight for this song 
 We told ourselves everything would be okay 
 But now it just seems so cliche 
 This time, this time, 
 Can we get it right now? 
 Finally make it right now 
 We seem to fight for what we are not 
 And then pass it through a lie 
 Tie the leaves on trees so they 
 Won't come down, so they won't come down! 
 This time, this time, 
 Can we get it right? 
 The motion's measuring 
 With every breath 
 And I'm exhausted 
 And alone 
 It's piercing hope 
 It's piercing hope 
 So pick me up 
 'Cause there's still hope 
 There's still hope 
 This time, this time, 
 Can we get it right now? 
 Finally make it right now 
 We seem to fight for what we are not 
 And then pass it through a lie 
 Tie the leaves on trees so they 
 Won't come down, so they won't come down 
 This time, this time, 
 Can we get it right? 
 This time, this time, 
 Can we get it right?

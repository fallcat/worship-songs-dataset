Beautiful One, more precious than gold or silver 
 Or diamonds in this world 
 Beautiful One, I will worship You forever 
 You're my treasure Lord 
 I hear Your voice through the streams 
 I feel Your love beneath the trees 
 This river breaths and time stand stills 
 Creation speaks to show You're real 
 Beautiful One, more precious than gold or silver 
 Or diamonds in this world 
 Beautiful One, I will worship You forever 
 You're my treasure Lord 
 Morning light reflects Your love 
 Through the power of the rising sun 
 The moon calls night as the clouds collide 
 The universe is singing tonight 
 Beautiful One, more precious than gold or silver 
 Or diamonds in this world 
 Beautiful One, I will worship You forever 
 You're my treasure Lord 
 How lovely is Your Name, the Risen One 
 All glory to the King, to You we sing 
 Beautiful One, more precious than gold or silver 
 Or diamonds in this world 
 Beautiful One, I will worship You forever 
 You're my treasure Lord 
 Beautiful One, more precious than gold or silver 
 Or diamonds in this world 
 Beautiful One, I will worship You forever 
 You're my treasure Lord 
 My treasure Lord 
 Oh, You're my treasure Lord 
 My treasure Lord 
 You're my treasure, Lord

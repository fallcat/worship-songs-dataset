Unbelief, it buries all the laughter of our dreams 
 Underneath, the fragrance of our heart's deceit 
 You and I, we hide behind the corner of our minds 
 And we all need faith, the faith to love all that You are 
 And we all need love, when there's no hope beyond the door 
 And we all need hope, the hope to live for something more 
 Oh... 
 Silhouette, reflects a vacancy of our intent 
 We forget, the voice that makes our heart content 
 You and I, seeking out our place in time, 
 In time, 
 The cure of life is redefined 
 And we all need faith, the faith to love all that You are 
 We all need love, when there's no hope beyond the door 
 We all need hope, the hope to live for something more 
 Oh... 
 I see the fear that's in your eyes 
 Feel the pain you try to hide, 
 It's all right, it's all right 
 I can see you on your knees 
 Don't give up 'cause it will be 
 All right, All right 
 And you'll be all right, you'll be all right 
 All right, All right 
 And we all need faith the faith to love all that You are 
 We all need love, when there's no hope beyond the door 
 And we all need hope, the hope to live for something more 
 Oh...

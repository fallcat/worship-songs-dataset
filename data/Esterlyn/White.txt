Make me whiter, make me whiter than snow 
 Make me whiter, make me whiter than snow 
 Create in me a clean heart, oh God 
 And renew a steadfast spirit within me 
 Do not cast me away from your presence 
 Do not withhold your spirit from me 
 Make me whiter, make me whiter than snow 
 Make me whiter, make me whiter than snow 
 Make me whiter, make me whiter than snow 
 Make me whiter, make me whiter than snow 
 Restore in me the joy of your salvation 
 Restore in me the joy of your salvation 
 You make me whiter, you make me whiter than snow 
 You make me whiter, you make me whiter than snow 
 You make me whiter, you make me whiter than snow 
 You make me whiter, you make me whiter than snow 
 You make me whiter, make me whiter than snow 
 You make me whiter, make me whiter than snow

You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 My eyes they could not see 
 I was lost without you 
 Lord, set me free 
 Come and wake me now 
 The darkness of night 
 Could not hold you down 
 Day's brought your light 
 Come and wake me now 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 The wars that wage inside 
 Try to keep me from you 
 But love have overcome 
 You are waking now 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 I was blind but now I see 
 You have breathed new life in me 
 You have saved me from my sleep 
 Stir in me, awaken me 
 I was blind but now I see 
 You have breathed new life in me 
 You have saved me from my sleep 
 Stir in me, awaken me 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 You awaken, you awaken me 
 Give me eyes Lord, give me eyes to see 
 Hey, hey

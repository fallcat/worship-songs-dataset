I know it seems 
 Like this could be 
 The darkest day you've known 
 But believe you me 
 The God of strength 
 Will never let you go 
 He will overcome, I know 
 And the arms that hold the universe 
 Are holding you tonight 
 You can rest inside 
 It's gonna be alright 
 And the voice that calmed the raging sea 
 Is calling you His child 
 So be still and know He's in control 
 He will never let you go 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 You have already come 
 His grace has brought you safe this far 
 And His grace will lead you home 
 And the arms that hold the universe 
 Are holding you tonight 
 You can rest inside 
 It's gonna be alright 
 And the voice that calmed the raging sea 
 Is calling you His child 
 So be still and know He's in control 
 He will never let you go 
 You can hope, you can rise, you can stand 
 He has still got the whole world in His hands 
 You can hope, you can rise, you can stand 
 He's still got the whole world, the whole world in His hands 
 And the arms that hold the universe 
 Are holding you tonight 
 You can rest inside 
 It's gonna be alright 
 And the voice that calmed the raging sea 
 Is calling you His child 
 So be still and know He's in control 
 He will never let you go 
 He will never let you go 
 He's Still got the whole world in His hands 
 In His hands, yeah 
 Still got the whole world in His hands

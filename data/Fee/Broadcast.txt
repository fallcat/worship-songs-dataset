I know a name 
 That is higher than any name 
 I know the man 
 Who is breaking the prison chains 
 He is the one 
 Who's overtake the grave 
 Shake this ground with the victory sound 
 Our God reigns and we're shouting it loud 
 We're gonna broadcast all over the world 
 That You are God and You are good 
 We're gonna broadcast all over the world 
 That You are God and You are good 
 I know the One 
 Who has conquered the enemy 
 He is the King of Life and Liberty 
 All around the world let freedom ring 
 All over the earth 
 Let it be hear 
 Our God is good (yeah) 
 Come on 
 Shake this ground with the victory sound 
 Our God reigns and we're shouting it loud 
 Lift up your voice let it resound 
 Our God reigns and we're shouting it lou-d 
 We're gonna broadcast all over the world 
 That You are God and You are good [4x] 
 (We're gonna broadcast all over the world) All over the earth let it be heard 
 (That You are God and You are good) Our God is good 
 (We're gonna broadcast all over the world) All over the earth let it be heard 
 (That You are God and You are good) Our God is good 
 (We're gonna broadcast all over the world) All over the earth, come on

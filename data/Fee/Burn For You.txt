There's a stirring in my heart, unexplainable 
 There's a calling on my days, undeniable 
 There's a fire in my bones, uncontainable 
 And it's causing me to burn 
 It's causing me to burn 
 It's causing me to burn for You 
 I'll go anywhere 
 I'll do anything 
 At any cost for You my King 
 There's a passion in my heart, for the world to see 
 Revival fires burning, great awakening 
 There's a raging fire inside this soul of mine 
 To the ends of the earth 
 To the ends of the earth 
 To the farthest part 
 Till every heart has heard

You said You'd never leave or forsake me 
 When You said, this life is gonna shake me 
 And You said this world is gonna bring trouble on my soul 
 This I know 
 When everything falls apart Your arms hold me together 
 When everything falls apart You're the only hope for this heart 
 When everything falls apart and my strength is gone 
 I find You mighty and strong 
 You keep holding on 
 You keep holding on 
 When I see the darkness all around me 
 When I see that tragedy has found me 
 I still believe Your faithful arms will never let me go 
 And still I know 
 When everything falls apart Your arms hold me together 
 When everything falls apart You're the only hope for this heart 
 When everything falls apart and my strength is gone 
 I find You mighty and strong 
 You keep holding on 
 You keep holding on 
 Sorrow will last for the night 
 But hope is rising with the sun, it's rising with the sun 
 There will be storms in this life 
 But I know You have overcome, You have overcome 
 When everything falls apart Your arms hold me together 
 When everything falls apart You're the only hope for this heart 
 When everything falls apart and my strength is gone 
 I find you mighty and strong 
 You keep holding on 
 When everything falls apart Your arms hold me together 
 When everything falls apart You're the only hope for this heart 
 When everything falls apart and my strength is gone 
 I find you mighty and strong 
 You keep holding on 
 You keep holding on

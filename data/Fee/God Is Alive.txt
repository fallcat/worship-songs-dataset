Let the darkness flee 
 It's got no power over me 
 I have been set free, God is alive 
 Death where is your sting 
 Sin has got no hold on me 
 I am free indeed. God is alive. 
 We've been redeemed 
 So rise and sing 
 Everyone glorify the risen Son 
 The Holy One has overcome 
 Jesus is alive 
 The enemy is broken underneath His feet 
 Death is crushed in victory 
 Jesus is alive 
 Jesus is alive 
 Let us wake and rise 
 Lift your voices lift our eyes 
 We're gonna shout we're gonna shake the skies 
 God is alive 
 We've been redeemed 
 So rise and sing 
 Everyone glorify the risen Son 
 The Holy One has overcome 
 Jesus is alive 
 The enemy is broken underneath His feet 
 Death is crushed in victory 
 Jesus is alive 
 Jesus is alive 
 The empty grave is singing now it's shouting out 
 He is alive, He is alive 
 And we are free. 
 We've been redeemed 
 So rise and sing 
 Everyone glorify the risen Son 
 The Holy One has overcome 
 Jesus is alive 
 The enemy is broken underneath His feet 
 Death is crushed in victory 
 Jesus is alive 
 Jesus is alive

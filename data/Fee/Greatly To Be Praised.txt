Lift your eyes, lift your eyes to the One 
 Who's reigning over us, for He has overcome 
 Fill the skies, fill the skies with a song 
 As heaven sings along, to glorify the Son 
 Who is like You, none compare 
 There's no one like our God 
 Great and greatly to be praised 
 Name above all other names 
 Powerful and strong to save 
 Hallelujah, our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Tell the world, tell the world of the love 
 He's lavished over us, His daughters and His sons 
 Made alive, made alive, now we're free 
 Rescued and redeemed, the victory is won 
 Who is like You, none compare 
 There's no one like our God 
 Great and greatly to be praised 
 Name above all other names 
 Powerful and strong to save 
 Hallelujah, our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Glory in the highest place 
 King of mercy, God of grace 
 Together let the earth proclaim 
 Hallelujah, our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 We lift our eyes up, behold the Son 
 Lift our voices, and sing as one 
 Hallelujah, our God reigns 
 Great and greatly to be praised 
 Name above all other names 
 Powerful and strong to save 
 Hallelujah, our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Glory in the highest place 
 King of mercy, God of grace 
 Together let the earth proclaim 
 Hallelujah, our God reigns 
 Our God reigns

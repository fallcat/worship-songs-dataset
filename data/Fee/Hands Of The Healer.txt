Blood flows down 
 Blood flows down 
 Flowing from the hands of the Healer 
 Death is bound 
 Death is bound 
 It's broken in the hands of the Healer 
 So beautiful 
 So beautiful 
 So beautiful Your love 
 Glory to the King who gave His life 
 Glory to the Lamb of sacrifice 
 Beautiful and broken, holiness and love 
 Glorious the wounded hands of God 
 Risen life 
 Risen life 
 Purchased by the hands of the Healer 
 Sanctified 
 Sanctified 
 How precious are the hands of the Healer 
 So beautiful 
 So beautiful 
 So beautiful Your love 
 Glory to the King who gave His life 
 Glory to the Lamb of sacrifice 
 Beautiful and broken, holiness and love 
 Glorious the wounded hands of God 
 So beautiful, oh so beautiful 
 So beautiful the hands of love 
 So powerful, oh so powerful 
 So powerful the hands of love 
 Glory to the King who gave His life 
 Glory to the Lamb of sacrifice 
 Beautiful and broken, holiness and love 
 Glorious the wounded hands of God 
 So beautiful, so beautiful, so so beautiful 
 The hands of God, the hands of the Healer 
 The hands of God, so beautiful, so so beautiful

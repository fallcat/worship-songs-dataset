The greatest day in history: 
 Death is beaten, 
 You have rescued me. 
 Sing it out: 
 Jesus is alive 
 Empty cross 
 And empty grave, 
 Life eternal; 
 You have won the day. 
 Shout it out: 
 Jesus is alive. 
 He's alive. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day. 
 You wash my sin away. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day. 
 I'll never be the same, 
 Oh no. 
 Forever I am changed. 
 When I stand in that place, 
 Free at last 
 Meeting face to face. 
 I am Yours; 
 Jesus, you are mine. 
 Endless joy and perfect peace, 
 Earthly pain finally will cease. 
 Celebrate, Jesus is alive. 
 Yeah, He's alive. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day 
 You wash my sin away. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day. 
 I'll never be the same, 
 Oh no. 
 Forever I am changed. 
 And oh, what a glorious day, 
 What a glorious way 
 That you have saved me. 
 And oh, what a glorious day, 
 What a glorious Name, yeah. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day. 
 You wash my sin away. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day. 
 I'll never be the same. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day. 
 You wash my sin away. 
 Oh, happy day, 
 Happy day. 
 I'll never be the same, 
 Oh no. 
 Forever I am changed. 
 What a glorious, glorious day. 
 I'll never be the same.

I'm going to the Promised Land 
 Everybody come on and take my hand 
 I'm going up to Glory Land 
 I'm gonna see my Lord, 
 Ain't gonna cry no more 
 This life is filled with woes and with sorrow, and tragedies untold 
 But my Jesus offers hope for tomorrow 
 Heaven is my home 
 I'm going to the Promised Land 
 Everybody come on and take my hand 
 I'm going up to Glory Land 
 I'm gonna see my Lord, 
 Ain't gonna cry no more 
 When they lay me underneath a heavy stone 
 And the cold grave grips my bones 
 Don't cry for me for in Glory will be 
 Dancing around the throne 
 I'm going to the Promised Land 
 Everybody come on and take my hand 
 I'm going up to Glory Land 
 I'm gonna see my Lord, 
 Ain't gonna cry no more 
 I'm going to see my Savior 
 I'm going to see my Lord 
 I'm going to sing forever 
 Ain't gonna cry no more 
 I'm going to the Promised Land 
 Everybody come on and take my hand 
 I'm going up to Glory Land 
 I'm gonna see my Lord, 
 Ain't gonna cry no more

Jesus, Lord of my salvation, Savior of my soul. 
 Send me out to the world to make You known. 
 Jesus, King of every nation, this world's only hope. 
 Send me out to the world to make you known. 
 Send me out to the world. 
 I wanna be Your hands and feet. 
 I wanna be Your voice every time I speak. 
 I wanna run to the ones in need, in the name of Jesus. 
 I wanna give my life away, all for Your kingdom's sake. 
 Shine a light in the darkest place, in the name of Jesus. 
 In the name of Jesus. 
 Carry to the broken-hearted mercy You Have shown. 
 Send me out to the world to make You known. 
 And to the ones in need of rescue, lead me I will go. 
 Send me out to the world to make you known. 
 Send me out to the world. 
 Here am I, I will go. 
 Send me out to make You known. 
 There is hope for every soul, send me out, send me out. 
 Here am I, I will go. 
 Send me out to make You known. 
 There is hope for every soul, send me out, send me out.

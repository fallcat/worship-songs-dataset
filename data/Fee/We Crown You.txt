All hail the power of Jesus' name 
 The wonders of His grace our Savior 
 All bow before the King of love 
 Our treasure and our God Redeemer 
 There is none more holy 
 Great and mighty 
 No one like our God 
 King of kings and God of grace 
 Our Redeemer strong to save 
 High and holy lifted up 
 There is none more worthy 
 Lord we crown You Lord of all 
 All sing a melody of praise 
 Our grateful hearts we raise to You our treasure 
 All rise and shout a vict'ry cry 
 'Cause Jesus is alive and we have been forgiven 
 There is none more holy 
 Great and mighty 
 No one like our God 
 King of kings and God of grace 
 Our Redeemer strong to save 
 High and holy lifted up 
 There is none more worthy 
 Lord we crown You Lord of all 
 For the life that You've restored 
 For the hope that's been reborn 
 Ev'ry prodigal called home 
 Grace and mercy You have shown 
 For the blood that washed me pure 
 For my sin and shame no more 
 Son of God our greatest prize 
 King of glory Jesus Christ 
 King of kings and God of grace 
 Our Redeemer strong to save 
 High and holy lifted up 
 There is none more worthy 
 Lord we crown You Lord of all 
 We crown You Lord of all 
 Lord of all

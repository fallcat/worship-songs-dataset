It's to high to measure 
 It's to great a treasure 
 Longer than forever 
 It's inconceivable 
 Big enough to live in 
 Deep enough to swim in 
 Breathing out just to breathe in 
 It's overtaken my soul 
 How high 
 How deep 
 How great is your love for me 
 It's making my heart sing 
 Your love 
 Your perfect love has found me 
 Covers and surrounds me 
 Your love is better than life 
 Your love 
 Loved me first and saved me 
 Rescued and it raised me 
 Your love is better than life 
 It's coming down like rain 
 It's calling out my name 
 It's causing me to love the same 
 Unconditional 
 How high 
 How deep 
 How great is your love for me 
 It's making my heart sing 
 Your love 
 Your perfect love has found me 
 Covers and surrounds me 
 Your love is better than life 
 Your love 
 Loved me first and saved me 
 Rescued and it raised me 
 Your love is better than life 
 Your love is better than life 
 King of love be glorified 
 Your love has given me life 
 King of love be glorified 
 Your love 
 Your perfect love has found me 
 Covers and surrounds me 
 Your love is better than life 
 Your love 
 Loved me first and saved me 
 Rescued and it raised me 
 Your love is better than life 
 Your love is better than life 
 King of love be glorified 
 Your love has given me life 
 King of love be glorified

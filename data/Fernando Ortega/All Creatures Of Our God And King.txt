All creatures of our God and King, 
 Lift up your voice and with us sing, 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 Thou burning sun with golden beam, 
 Thou silver moon with softer gleam! 
 O praise Him, O praise Him! 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 Thou rushing wind that art so strong, 
 Ye clouds that sail in heav'n along, 
 O praise Him! Alleluia! 
 Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice, 
 Ye lights of evening, find a voice! 
 O praise Him, O praise Him! 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 And all ye men of tender heart, 
 Forgiving others, take your part, 
 O sing ye! Alleluia! 
 Ye who long pain and sorrow bear, 
 Praise God and on Him cast your care! 
 O praise Him, O praise Him! 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 Praise God from Whom all blessings flow, 
 Praise Him all creatures here below, 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 Praise Him above, ye heavenly host, 
 Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost! 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 Alleluia! Alleluia!

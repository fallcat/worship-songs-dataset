All flesh is like the grass 
 The grass withers and fades away 
 All flesh is like the grass 
 The grass withers and fades away 
 The glory of man, like a flower 
 That shrivels in the sun and falls 
 The glory of man, like a flower 
 That shrivels in the sun and falls 
 But the Word of the Lord 
 Endures forever 
 The Word of the Lord 
 Endures forever

All my life 
 Fernando Ortega - ALL MY LIFE 
 From the album - YOUR HOLINESS SURROUNDS ME 
 Label - Asaph (1994) 
 Let the words of my mouth, the meditation of my heart 
 Be acceptable in Your sight, my Lord 
 Let the words of my mouth, the meditation of my heart 
 Be acceptable, be acceptable 
 For You are my Rock, and You are my strength 
 You are my Redeemer 
 And I'll live for You 'cause You died for me 
 I need You to guide me all of my life 
 (Repeat above) 
 I need You all of my life 
 I need You all of my life 
 I need You all of my life 
 I need You all of my life

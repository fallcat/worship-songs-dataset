Roses outside the window screen 
 A breeze that lingers in the blinds 
 A song and a prayer to slow the time 
 A couple of chairs pulled in a line 
 He remembers to breathe and then forgets 
 He says, come on, we let him rest 
 Into the golden afternoon 
 Much too long and over soon 
 This is the moment that lovers part 
 He tries to take her but he cannot 
 The long years ending with a sign 
 And all the anguish, all that time 
 It may have been love that held them fast 
 Or want of love that made it last 
 Our long arms hanging at our sides 
 All that time, all that time 
 Wasn't it love that made him cry? 
 And love that seemed to pass him by 
 The voices raised, the voices kind 
 And then the silence, for all that time 
 This is the ending we will take 
 For one another, for always 
 A well of tears, a wall of pride 
 And all our love, for all that time

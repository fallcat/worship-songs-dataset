One morning 
 When time is done 
 Bright heaven 
 Will be our refuge 
 The city of God most high 
 I long for 
 That holy day 
 This longing 
 Sometimes it captures my heart 
 And carries me far away 
 Beyond the sky 
 Beyond all telling 
 Our Father Himself 
 Will be our light 
 His arms will, hold us 
 And with His hands 
 He'll wipe away the tears 
 That stain our eyes 
 When darkness 
 Falls over me 
 This promise 
 It's like a fire inside 
 Burning the dark away 
 Beyond the sky 
 Beyond all telling 
 Our Father Himself 
 Will be our light 
 His arms will, hold us 
 And with His hands 
 He'll wipe away the tears 
 That stain our eyes 
 (Oh oh oh) 
 (Ah a-ah) 
 (A-ah ah ah)

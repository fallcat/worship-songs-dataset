Good evening, lovely evening 
 A perfect evening for a stroll on the town 
 Couples on the boardwalk and down on the sandbar 
 Holding hands, staring out to the moon on the ocean 
 Silver and soft water in motion 
 Car lights, Pacific highway, we look both ways 
 My baby and me, we find a fancy restaurant 
 A table outside, in a quiet corner please 
 Wind in the palm trees, candles and wine 
 Her clear blue eyes, we stay till closing 
 Come on, my love, we can walk home 
 Past the dancers and the bands winding down 
 Remind me again, what's the question? 
 We belong here in this California town 
 Slow fade of summer stars in the sky 
 Songs in the night, the boom of the breakers 
 The pull of the tide, the swell and the sigh 
 Salt in the sea spray

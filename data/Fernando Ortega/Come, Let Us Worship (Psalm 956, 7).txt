Come, let us worship and bow down 
 And kneel before the Lord, our Maker 
 Come, let us worship and bow down 
 And kneel before the Lord, our Maker 
 He is our God, He is our God 
 We are the people of His pasture 
 He is our God, He is our God 
 We are the sheep of His hand 
 Come, let us worship and bow down 
 And kneel before the Lord, our Maker 
 Come, let us worship and bow down 
 And kneel before the Lord, our Maker 
 Worship the Lord in holiness 
 Let the whole earth stand in awe 
 He will come to judge the earth 
 In righteousness and truth

Come, ye sinners, poor and needy 
 Weak and wounded, sick and sore 
 Jesus ready, stands to save you 
 Full of pity, love and power 
 I will arise and go to Jesus 
 He will embrace me in His arms 
 In the arms of my dear Savior 
 Oh, there are ten thousand charms 
 Come, ye thirsty, come and welcome 
 God's free bounty glorify 
 True belief and true repentance 
 Every grace that brings you nigh 
 Come, ye weary, heavy-laden 
 Lost and ruined by the fall 
 If you tarry 'til you're better 
 You will never come at all 
 I will arise and go to Jesus 
 He will embrace me in His arms 
 In the arms of my dear Savior 
 Oh, there are ten thousand charms 
 Feel Him Prostate in the garden 
 On the ground your Maker lies 
 On the bloody tree, behold him 
 Sinner, will this not suffice? 
 Lo, the incarnate God ascended 
 Pleads the merit of his blood 
 Venture on him, venture wholly 
 Let no other trust intrude 
 I will arise and go to Jesus 
 He will embrace me in His arms 
 In the arms of my dear Savior 
 In the arms of my dear Savior 
 In the arms of my dear Savior 
 Oh, there are ten thousand charms

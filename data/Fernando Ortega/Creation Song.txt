He wraps Himself in light 
 As with a garment, 
 He spreads out the heavens 
 And walks on the wings of the wind. 
 He sends forth the springs 
 From the valleys 
 The flow between moutains. 
 The birds of the air dwell 
 By the waters, 
 Lifting their voices in song- 
 Singing glory, glory! 
 Glory to the Lamb! 
 All praises and honor forever. 
 He made the moon for its season, 
 The sun knows it setting. 
 He looks at the Earth and it trembles, 
 He touches the mountains 
 And they smoke, 
 I will sing to the Lord all my life, 
 I will sing praises to my God - 
 As long as I live, 
 Praises to the Lord, oh my soul. 
 Singing glory, hallelujah! 
 Glory to our God! 
 All praises and honor forever.

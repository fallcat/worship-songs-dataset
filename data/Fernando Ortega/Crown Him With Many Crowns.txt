Crown Him with many crowns 
 The Lamb upon His throne 
 Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns 
 All music but its own 
 Awake my soul and sing 
 Of Him who died for thee 
 And hail Him as thy matchless King 
 Through all eternity 
 Crown Him the Lord of life 
 Who triumphed o'er the grave 
 And rose victorious in the strife 
 For those He came to save 
 His glories now we sing 
 Who died and rose on high 
 Who died eternal life to bring 
 And lives that death may die 
 Crown Him the Lord of years 
 The Potentate of time 
 Creator of the rolling spheres 
 Ineffably sublime 
 All hail, Redeemer hail 
 For Thou hast died for me 
 Thy praise and glory shall not fail 
 Through all eternity 
 Crown Him the Son of God 
 Before the worlds began 
 And ye, who tread where He hath trod 
 Crown Him the Son of man 
 Who every grief hath known 
 That wrings the human breast 
 And takes and bears them for His own 
 That all in Him may rest 
 Crown Him the Lord of heaven 
 One with the Father known 
 One with the Spirit through Him given 
 From yonder glorious throne 
 All hail, Redeemer, hail 
 For Thou hast died for me 
 Thy praise and glory shall not fail 
 Throughout eternity

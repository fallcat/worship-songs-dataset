As I walked out one evening 
 To breathe the air and soothe my mind, 
 I thought of friends and the home I had, 
 And all those things I left behind. 
 A silent star shone on me, 
 My eyes saw a far horizon, 
 As if to pierce this veil of time, 
 And escape this earthly prison. 
 Will there come a time when the memories fade. 
 And pass on with the long, long years, 
 When the ties no longer bind? 
 Lord save me from this darkest fear. 
 Don't let me come home a stranger, 
 I couldn't stand to be a stranger.

Come a little closer, dragonfly 
 Settle down with me a little while 
 I'm turning off the phone and enterprise 
 I could use your company, alright 
 Hey, hey, dragonfly 
 I'd like to stare into your big bug eyes 
 Get a closer look at your fine wings 
 Think about some fleeting, pretty things 
 Hey, hey, hey dragonfly 
 Come a little closer, dragonfly 
 Little sapphire slipping through the sky 
 Between the skaters and the fishing lines 
 My, my, my dragonfly 
 Hey, hey, dragonfly 
 I'd like to stare into your big bug eyes 
 Get a closer look at your fine wings 
 Think about some fleeting, pretty things 
 Hey, hey, hey, dragonfly 
 Hey, hey, hey, dragonfly 
 Come a little closer, dragonfly 
 I love the quiet air you occupy 
 I'm sitting down right here, right now, alone 
 To hear the river lapping at the stone 
 Hey, hey, dragonfly 
 I'd like to stare into your big bug eyes 
 Get a closer look at your fine wings 
 Think about some fleeting, pretty things 
 Hey, hey, hey, dragonfly 
 Hey, hey, hey, dragonfly 
 Hey, hey, dragonfly 
 I'd like to ride with you tonight 
 Take in your show, take up your life 
 Dragonfly, I really like your style

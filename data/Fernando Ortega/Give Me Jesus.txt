In the morning, when I rise 
 In the morning, when I rise 
 In the morning, when I rise, give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus, 
 Give me Jesus, 
 You can have all this world, 
 But give me Jesus 
 When I am alone 
 When I am alone 
 When I am alone, give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus, 
 Give me Jesus, 
 You can have all this world, 
 But give me Jesus 
 When I come to die 
 When I come to die 
 When I come to die, give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus, 
 Give me Jesus, 
 You can have all this world, 
 You can have all this world, 
 You can have all this world, 
 But give me Jesus

As I walk, Lord, Through the valley, 
 Hold my hand, Hold my trembling hand. 
 If I stumble by the wayside, 
 In Your strength help me stand. 
 The sparks fly upward while the wind blows 
 Like a spirit, Lost upon the sea. 
 I am torn, Lord, And born to trouble. 
 I am blind and I am weak. 
 Hear me calling, Great Redeemer, 
 At the foot of Your dark cross 
 Where You suffered for the sinner, 
 Bleeding, Dying, For the lost. 
 Go before me through the valley, 
 Speak to me, For I know Your voice. 
 Lead me homeward, Gentle Shepherd, 
 God of Love, God of Grace. 
 Hear me calling, Great Redeemer, 
 At the foot of Your dark cross 
 Where You suffered for the sinner, 
 Bleeding, Dying, For the lost. 
 Go before me through the valley, 
 Speak to me, For I know Your voice. 
 Lead me homeward, Gentle Shepherd, 
 God of Love, God of Grace.

Here is love, vast as the ocean 
 Lovingkindness as the flood 
 When the Prince of Life, our Ransom 
 Shed for us His precious blood 
 Who His love will not remember? 
 Who can cease to sing His praise? 
 He can never be forgotten 
 Throughout Heav'n's eternal days 
 On the mount of crucifixion 
 Fountains opened deep and wide 
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy 
 Flowed a vast a gracious tide 
 Grace and love, like mighty rivers 
 Poured incessant from above 
 And Heav'n's peace and perfect justice 
 Kissed a guilty world in love

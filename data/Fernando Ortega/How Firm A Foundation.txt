How firm a foundation ye saints of the Lord, 
 Is laid for your faith in His excellent word. 
 What more can He say, Than to you He hath said; 
 To you, Who for refuge to Jesus have fled? 
 Fear not, I am with thee, Oh be not dismayed, 
 For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid. 
 I'll strengthen thee, Help thee, And cause thee to stand, 
 Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand. 
 When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, 
 My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply. 
 The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design 
 Thy dross to consume, And thy gold to refine. 
 The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose, 
 I will not, I will not desert to his foes. 
 That soul, though all hell should endeaver to shake, 
 I never, No never, No never forsake. 
 That soul, though all hell should endeaver to shake, 
 I will never, No never, No never forsake.

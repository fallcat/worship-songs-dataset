When the morning falls 
 On the farthest hill 
 I will sing His name 
 I will praise Him still 
 When dark trials come 
 And my heart is filled 
 With the weight of doubt 
 I will praise Him still 
 For the Lord our God 
 He is strong to save 
 From the arms of death 
 From the deepest grave 
 And He gave us life 
 In His perfect will 
 And by His good grace 
 I will praise Him still 
 When the morning falls 
 On the farthest hill 
 I will sing His name 
 I will praise Him still 
 When dark trials come 
 And my heart is filled 
 With the weight of doubt 
 I will praise Him still 
 For the Lord our God 
 He is strong to save 
 From the arms of death 
 From the deepest grave 
 For the Lord our God 
 He is strong to save 
 From the arms of death 
 From the deepest grave 
 And He gave us life 
 In His perfect will 
 And by His good grace 
 I will praise Him still 
 When the morning falls 
 On the farthest hill 
 I will sing His name 
 I will praise Him still

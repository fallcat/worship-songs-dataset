I will sing of my Redeemer 
 And His wondrous love to me; 
 On the cruel cross he suffered 
 From the curse to set me free. 
 Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer 
 With his blood, he purchased me, 
 On the cross, he sealed my pardon, 
 Paid the debt, and made me free. 
 I will tell the wondrous story 
 How my lost estate, to save. 
 In his boundless love and mercy, 
 He, the ransom freely gave. 
 Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer 
 With his blood, he purchased me, 
 On the cross, he sealed my pardon, 
 Paid the debt, and made me free. 
 I will praise my dear Redeemer, 
 His triumphant power I'll tell, 
 How the victory he giveth 
 Over sin, and death, and hell. 
 Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer 
 With his blood, he purchased me, 
 On the cross, he sealed my pardon, 
 Paid the debt, and made me free. 
 I will sing of my Redeemer, 
 And His heav'nly love to me; 
 He from death to life hath brought me, 
 Son of God with Him to be. 
 Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer 
 With his blood, he purchased me, 
 On the cross, he sealed my pardon, 
 Paid the debt, and made me free. 
 Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer 
 With his blood, he purchased me, 
 On the cross, he sealed my pardon, 
 Paid the debt, and made me free.

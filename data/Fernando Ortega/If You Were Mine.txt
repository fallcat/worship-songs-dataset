When my heart is troubled and I am weighed down, 
 Then I like to think of how this lonesome world would be 
 If I could see your face, or hold you in my arms 
 If you were mine, if you were mine. 
 If you had a bad dream I would jump inside it, 
 And I would fight for you with all the strength that I could find. 
 I would lead you home by your tiny hand 
 If you were mine, if you were mine. 
 I would sing of love on the blackest night. 
 I would sing of God, and how His goodness fills our loves. 
 I would sing to you, 'til the morning light 
 If you were mine, if you were mine.

Jesus, King of angels, Heaven's light 
 Shine Your face upon this house tonight 
 Let no evil come into my dreams 
 Light of Heaven keep me in Your peace 
 Remind me how You made dark spirits flee 
 And spoke Your power to the raging sea 
 And spoke Your mercy to a sinful man 
 Remind me Jesus, this is what I am 
 The universe is vast beyond the stars 
 But You are mindful when the sparrow falls 
 And mindful of the anxious thoughts 
 That find me, surround me and bind me 
 With all my heart I love You, Sovereign Lord 
 Tomorrow let me love You even more 
 And rise to speak the goodness of Your name 
 Until I close my eyes and sleep again 
 The universe is vast beyond the stars 
 But You are mindful when the sparrow falls 
 And mindful of the anxious thoughts 
 That find me, surround me and bind me 
 Jesus, King of angels, Heaven's light 
 Hold my hand and keep me through this night

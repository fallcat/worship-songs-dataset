I waited and waited for God 
 He turned and He heard me 
 He lifted me out of the mud 
 His Own Hands 
 They cured me 
 The Lord is my help 
 I will not be confounded 
 So I have focused my face like a flint 
 I'll not be ashamed 
 Lord, I come 
 Just as I am 
 Without one plea 
 But that Your blood 
 Was shed for me 
 Just as I am 
 Without one plea 
 But that Your blood 
 Was shed for me 
 Take the days that remain in my life 
 Lord let me serve You 
 While there is breath on my lips 
 I would proclaim You 
 I long for Your return 
 I long to see You face to face 
 I long to join the eternal song 
 Communion of all the saints 
 Lord, I come 
 Just as I am 
 Without one plea 
 But that Your blood 
 Was shed for me 
 Just as I am 
 Without one plea 
 But that Your blood 
 Was shed for me 
 Oh Oh, just as I am 
 Oh, Lord 
 Just as I am 
 Without one plea 
 But that Your blood 
 Was shed for me 
 Just as I am 
 Without one plea 
 But that Your blood 
 Was shed for me

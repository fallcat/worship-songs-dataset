Let all mortal flesh keep silence, and with fear and trembling stand; 
 Ponder nothing earthly minded, For with blessing is His hand, 
 Christ our God to earth descendeth, Our full homage to demand. 
 King of Kings, Yet born of Mary, As of old earth He stood, 
 Lord of Lords, In human vesture, In the body and the blood; 
 He will give to all the faithful. His own self for heavenly food. 
 Rank on rank the host of heaven spreads it's vanguard on the way, 
 As Light of light descendeth from the realms of endless day, 
 That the powers of hell may vanish as the darkness clears away. 
 At His feet the six-winged seraph, Cherubim, With sleepless eye, 
 Veil their faces to His presence as with ceaseless voice they cry: 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Lord Most High!

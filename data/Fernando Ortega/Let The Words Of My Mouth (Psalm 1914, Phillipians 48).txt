Let the words of my mouth 
 Be pleasing to You, pleasing to You 
 The meditation of my heart 
 Be pleasing to you, pleasing to You 
 Oh Lord, my strength 
 And my Redeemer 
 Whatever is true 
 Whatever is pure 
 Whatever is lovely 
 Whatever is worthy 
 Think on these things 
 Think on these things 
 Let the words of my mouth 
 Be pleasing to You 
 Pleasing to You

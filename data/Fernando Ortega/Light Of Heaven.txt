The sky is raining tears tonight 
 My brother 
 You know it's hard to sleep 
 So far from home 
 The moon has covered up her eyes 
 My sister 
 I thought I'd find you here 
 But I am all alone 
 All alone 
 Light of Heaven 
 Lord of mercy 
 Shine the goodness 
 Of your love upon this day 
 Till we see you 
 Till we know you 
 Till the sorrow 
 And the darkness fade away 
 Fade away 
 I searched the city streets today 
 My father 
 The tunnel and the train 
 The river and the rain 
 I walked beneath the harbor lights 
 My mother 
 And in the shadows there 
 I call your name 
 I call your name

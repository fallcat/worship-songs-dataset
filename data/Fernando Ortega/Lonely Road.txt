Well the sun has fallen 
 From the Western sky 
 House lights flicker on 
 As I travel by 
 On this lonely road 
 I am far, from my lover 
 Oh my lover's eyes 
 They are blue and gray 
 Like the changing t-ides 
 In Half Moon Bay 
 And she fills my, heart 
 Like the wind, in an open s-ail 
 She's my song in the evening 
 A clear voice 
 That calms me in the dark 
 Let this lonely road 
 Take me home, to my lover 
 There's a chill tonight 
 The late year lies down 
 While the crickets call 
 Outside my hotel room 
 By a firelight 
 She is waiting for me 
 She's my song in the evening 
 A clear voice 
 That calms me in the dark 
 And I belong there beside her 
 Where the waves break 
 Blue beneath the stars 
 Let this lonely road 
 Take me home, to my lover 
 Let this lonely road 
 Take me home, to my lover

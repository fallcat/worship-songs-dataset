Lord of Eternity 
 Blessed is the man 
 Who walks in Your favor 
 Who loves all Your words 
 And hides them like treasure 
 In the darkest place 
 Of his desperate heart, 
 They are a light 
 A strong, sure light. 
 Sometimes I call out Your name 
 But I cannot find You. 
 I look for Your face, 
 But You are not there. 
 By my sorrows, Lord, 
 Lift me to You, 
 Lift me to Your side. 
 Lord of Eternity, 
 Father of mercy, 
 Look on my fainting soul. 
 Keeper of all the stars, 
 Friend of the poorest heart 
 Touch me and make me whole. 
 If You are my defender, 
 Who is against me? 
 No one can trouble or harm me 
 If You are my strength. 
 All I ask, all I desire 
 Is to live in Your house all my days.

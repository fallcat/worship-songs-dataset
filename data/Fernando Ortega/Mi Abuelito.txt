The moon is shining on the Pecos Mountains 
 Like a blue and silver dream, 
 And far away below the moonlit mountains 
 You are standing in your field. 
 You are an old man, 
 The earth is in your voice, 
 And in the songs that spill from your memory. 
 A hoe in your old hand, 
 Black water in the furrowed rows, 
 You sing our lives as they used to be, 
 Mi abuelito. 
 Tomorrow morning we will carry you 
 Beyond the village to a stony hill, 
 And rest you there beside your brightest blanket, 
 Leaves and diamonds that you wove last year. 
 Then, with our song 
 We will call for the summer stars 
 To fill the sky like a silver dream. 
 How we will sing 
 As we hold to the memory of your earthen voice on the moonlit field, 
 "Mi abuelito - cantaremos de ti 
 En el cielo - cantaremos de ti 
 Cantando - cantaremos de ti 
 Entre la luna y las entrellas!"

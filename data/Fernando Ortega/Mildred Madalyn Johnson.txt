Mildred Madalyn Johnson 
 Born in the autumn of 1916 
 A shy, pretty girl from east Texas 
 Religious and restless 
 Humble and kind as a person could be 
 She loved to sing in the choir, 'loud and inspired 
 Her head tilted down, keeping time 
 Or tell stories with friends after supper 
 Ignoring the hour 
 A Calico cat fast asleep at her side 
 And she loved to drive her big red car 
 Though she couldn't see over the hood very far 
 She'd back out the driveway 
 And point that thing down the road 
 We'd say, "Lord, there she goes" 
 Her hair was silver and messy 
 She walked in a hurry 
 Worried about wasting the day 
 Some nights she sat at her dresser 
 Composing long letters 
 Falling asleep with a pen in her hand 
 And she loved to drive her big red car 
 A scarf 'round her shoulders, her foot to the floor 
 Down to the grocery, she'd wave goodbye 
 And we'd pray, "Lord, bring her back safe" 
 And she loved to drive her big red car 
 Though she couldn't see over the hood very far 
 She'd back out the driveway 
 And point that thing down the road 
 We'd say, "Lord, there she goes"

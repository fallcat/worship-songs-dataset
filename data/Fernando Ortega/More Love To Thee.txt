More love to Thee, O Christ 
 More love to Thee 
 Hear thou the prayer I make 
 On bended knee 
 This is my earnest plea 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee 
 Once earthly joy I craved 
 Sought peace and rest 
 Now, thee, alone I see 
 Give what is best 
 This all my prayer shall be 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee 
 Then shall my latest breath 
 Whisper Thy praise 
 This be the parting cry 
 My heart shall raise 
 Still all my prayer shall be 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee 
 More love to Thee, more love to Thee

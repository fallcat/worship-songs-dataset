I look for You in the middle of the night 
 Savior and guardian of my soul 
 From highest heaven You hear my call 
 And in my trouble You comfort and hold me 
 I long for You when I cannot hear Your voice 
 And my heart is dry as the dust 
 Oh Lord, be near me if I should fall 
 And show me how to believe and to trust You alone 
 There is no one else beside You 
 In the darkest night, in the wilderness 
 There is no one else beside You 
 At Your feet I cry, in Your arms I rest 
 I hope in You and Your promise to return 
 With angels and dark clouds of thunder 
 When death and evil, and sorrow flee away 
 And all creation will bow and proclaim You alone 
 There is no one else beside You 
 You will fill the sky when You come again 
 There is no one else beside You 
 Heaven's only light burning without end 
 There is no one else beside You 
 In the darkest night, in the wilderness 
 There is no one else beside You 
 At Your feet I cry, in Your arms I rest 
 There is no one else beside You 
 You will fill the sky when You come again 
 There is no one else beside You 
 Heaven's only light burning without end 
 No one, no one, no one beside You 
 No one, no one, no one beside You 
 No one, no one, no one beside You 
 No one, no one, no one beside You 
 No one, no one, no one beside You

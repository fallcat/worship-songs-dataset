I know there's hope in anger 
 And tenderness in shame 
 Sometimes I find you 
 On the other side of pain 
 But sometimes in the heat of day 
 When I close my eyes to pray 
 It seems like you are far from me 
 My prayers are all in vain 
 In my hour of hopelessness 
 In my deep despair 
 The noonday devil whispers in my ear 
 I know that you are with me 
 But I can't feel a thing 
 The noonday devil 
 Has come around again 
 Oh Lord, make me angry 
 Oh Lord, make me cry 
 Oh Lord, please don't leave me here 
 To fall into the devil's lies 
 Father, you have called me 
 To live a life that's true 
 That all my labors and my words 
 Would speak my love for you 
 But walking through this desert 
 Life is empty and mundane 
 The noonday devil 
 Has come around again 
 Oh Lord, make me angry 
 Oh Lord, make me cry 
 Oh Lord, please don't leave me here 
 To fall into the devil's lies 
 Oh Lord, make me angry 
 Oh Lord, make me cry 
 Oh Lord, break my cold, cold heart 
 So I can know your love inside 
 Your love inside

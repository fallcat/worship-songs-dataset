O sacred Head, now wounded, 
 With grief and shame weighed down, 
 Now scornfully surrounded 
 With thorns, Thine only crown 
 How pale thou art with anguish, 
 With sore abuse and scorn! 
 How doth Thy visage languish 
 Which once was bright as morn! 
 What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered, 
 T'was all for sinners' gain; 
 Mine, mine was the transgression, 
 But Thine the deadly pain. 
 Lo, here I fall, my Savior! 
 'Tis I deserve Thy place; 
 Look on me with Thy favor, 
 Vouchsafe to me Thy grace. 
 What language shall I borrow 
 To thank Thee, dearest friend, 
 For this Thy dying sorrow, 
 Thy pity without end? 
 O make me Thine forever, 
 And should I fainting be, 
 Lord, let me never, never 
 Outlive my love for Thee.

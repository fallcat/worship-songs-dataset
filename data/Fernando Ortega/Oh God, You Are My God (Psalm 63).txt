Oh God, you are my God 
 Earnestly I seek you 
 My Soul thirsts for you, 
 My flesh yearns for you 
 In a dry and weary land 
 Where there is no water. 
 I remember you at night 
 Through the watches of the night in the shadow of your wings 
 I sing because you helped me 
 My soul clings to you 
 And your hand upholds me 
 You alone

Every day 
 She will wander down the road 
 Back from town 
 Past all your houses with their 
 Pretty lights 
 And their pretty rooms 
 Every day, all alone 
 Down from the canyon to the shops, and cafes 
 Looking for coffee and a word or two 
 She would have with you 
 Have you ever seen her there 
 With no shoes 
 Stubborn as she goes 
 On and on 
 Do you know her face 
 Old girl 
 Tangles in her hair 
 She will turn your pity down 
 Turn it right around 
 Old girl 
 Weathered girl 
 An old blanket for a shawl, for a sleeve 
 Wrapped all around her with her 
 Little dress 
 And her hard feet 
 Have you ever seen her there 
 With no shoes 
 Stubborn as she goes 
 On and on 
 Heaven only knows 
 Where she's been 
 Or the world she's in 
 She will turn your pity down 
 Turn away and frown 
 Old girl 
 Old girl 
 Heaven only knows 
 Where she's been 
 Or why she walks alone 
 On and on 
 Or when she's had a friend 
 She may have a prayer for you 
 She can read you too 
 (2X) 
 Old girl

He wakes up worried 
 Something's always wrong 
 He can't remember 
 He goes on and on 
 On and on 
 He gets confused 
 Holds his head in his hands 
 Willful and afraid 
 But he's still a man 
 Still a man 
 He's alone 
 Frail and thin 
 We listen but fail him 
 Out of time 
 We're running out of time 
 An old life on the line 
 Old life on the line 
 He lost most everyone 
 He ever loved 
 His mother, his father 
 His only son 
 His only son 
 He holds onto things 
 Stamps and coins 
 He holds onto no one 
 And hides his mail 
 Like a broken boy 
 He's alone 
 Frail and thin 
 We listen but fail him 
 Out of time 
 We're running out of time 
 An old life on the line 
 Old life on the line 
 He believes in no one for too long 
 He needs attention, so many demands 
 So sentimental, a bitter man 
 A bitter man 
 He's alone 
 Frail and thin 
 We listen but fail him 
 Out of time 
 We're running out of time 
 An old life on the line 
 Old life on the line 
 Old life on the line

Eternal God, unchanging 
 Mysterious, and unknown 
 Your boundless love, unfailing 
 In grace and mercy shown 
 Bright Seraphim in endless flight 
 Around Your glorious throne 
 They raise their voices day and night 
 In praise to You alone 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God 
 Lord, we are weak and frail 
 Helpless in the storm 
 Surround us with Your angels 
 Hold us in Your arms 
 Our cold and ruthless enemy 
 His pleasure is our harm 
 Rise up, oh, Lord and he will flee 
 Before our sovereign God 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God 
 Let every creature in the sea 
 And every flying bird 
 Let every mountain, every field 
 And valley of the earth 
 Let all the moons and all the stars 
 In all the universe 
 Sing praises to the living God 
 Who rules them by His Word 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory be to our great God

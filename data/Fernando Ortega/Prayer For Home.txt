Grant them peace, most precious gift of all 
 Keep the worried world far away and small 
 When they return, may quiet fill their souls, 
 Dearest Lord, keep them safe within it's walls. 
 May the stone be cool beneath their feet. 
 The canyon breezes circle soft and sweet 
 When darkness falls, the stars and opal moon 
 Find them wrapped in each other, ever warm. 
 May it be a refuge for their love, 
 A harbor for their deepest prayer. 
 May they come to flourish in the grove, 
 Grow ever nearer to You there. 
 Many a burdened friend in their company rises, 
 A heavy heart is soon released to fly. 
 May their table be blessed with laughter and with grace 
 And by the comfort of kinship be surprised. 
 May it be a refuge for their love, 
 A harbor for their deepest prayer. 
 May they come to flourish in the grove, 
 Grow ever nearer to You there. 
 May the cold wind blow far from their front door 
 May the winter rains never bring them harm 
 May their hearthfires burn throughout the night 
 Grant them peace until morning's perfect light. 
 May it be a refuge for their love, 
 A harbor for their deepest prayer. 
 May they come to flourish in the grove, 
 Grow ever nearer to You there.

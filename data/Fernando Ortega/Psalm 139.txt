Lord you're near me every hour 
 You would know the least thing 
 You who see me from afar 
 Sleeping or arising 
 Lord before me and behind 
 Infinite and ageless 
 Such a number is too high 
 I cannot attain it 
 If to heaven I will fly 
 You will be beside me 
 If in Sheol I will lie 
 Even there you'll find me 
 If I fled on morning wings 
 Far beyond the great sea 
 Even there your hand will lead 
 For I Am will guide me 
 In the secret of the womb 
 I was formed and molded 
 I was skillfull and adorned 
 Wonderfully worthed 
 You have numbered all my days 
 Long before you gave them 
 In the pages of the book 
 They have all been gifted 
 High and wondrous are your thoughts 
 Fast beyond our telling 
 If I count them they grow more 
 I can never grasp them 
 Search me God and know my heart 
 Let evil never find me 
 Lead me on your rigtheous path 
 Sure and everlasting.

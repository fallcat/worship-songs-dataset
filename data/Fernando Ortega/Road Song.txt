How I love these roads 
 Every far and lonely highway, 
 Through basin and range 
 And a desert that never ends- 
 A sky so wide 
 You can feel your heart turn quiet, 
 And then I listen 
 For the voices of my friends 
 One rides in the summer wind beside me, 
 One flies with the stars 
 That set the wild night on fire, 
 One runs close and steady as a river, 
 I could drive for miles 
 Carried by that choir. 
 From the hills of my hometown, 
 To the Arizona canyons, 
 From Chinle to Sky City 
 To the gorge of the Rio Grande- 
 The high and winding way 
 From Chimayo to Las Trampas, 
 The long road bends 
 To the sweet sound of my friends. 
 One's up where the clouds brush the mountains, 
 One rushes down a stream 
 Past the bright columbine - 
 I could drive for miles 
 Just thinking about them, 
 How I love the road 
 And these true friends of mine. 
 One rides in the summer wind beside me, 
 One flies with the stars 
 That set the wild night on fire, 
 One runs close and steady as a river 
 I could drive for miles 
 Carried by that choir.

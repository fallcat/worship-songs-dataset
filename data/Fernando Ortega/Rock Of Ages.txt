Rock of ages, cleft for me 
 Let me hide myself in thee 
 Let the water and the blood 
 From thy riven side which flowed 
 Be of sin the double cure 
 Cleanse me from its guilt and power 
 Nothing in my hand I bring 
 Simply to the cross I cling 
 Naked, come to thee for dress 
 Helpless look to thee for grace 
 Foul, I to the fountain fly 
 Wash me, Savior, or I die

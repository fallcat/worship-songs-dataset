Though I am weak 
 Sometimes weary 
 In times of trial 
 I hide my face 
 In the balance 
 Judge me wholly 
 Please don't judge me 
 By my shame 
 In dark hours 
 Of confrontation 
 When words may fall 
 Too soon to unsay 
 Don't mistake them 
 For my true meaning 
 They are measures 
 Of my shame 
 I have tried to 
 Live life humbly 
 Not a coward 
 Not in vain 
 When my meekness 
 Overcomes me 
 Remember me 
 Not my shame 
 Not my shame 
 I am small 
 And self-conscious 
 Every mirror 
 Reflects the grain 
 Judge my essence 
 By my kinships 
 Remember me 
 Not my shame 
 I am weak 
 Sometimes weary 
 Sometimes small 
 I hide away 
 When my hours 
 Are all accounted 
 Please don't bind me 
 To my shame 
 I have tried to 
 Live life humbly 
 Not a coward 
 Not in vain 
 When my meekness 
 Overcomes me 
 Remember me 
 Not my shame 
 Not my shame

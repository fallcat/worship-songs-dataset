Come and see, look on this mystery 
 The Lord of the Universe, nailed to a tree 
 Christ our God, spilling His Holy blood 
 Bowing in anguish, His sacred head 
 Sing to Jesus, Lord of our shame 
 Lord of our sinful hearts. 
 He is our great Redeemer. 
 Sing to Jesus, Honor His name. 
 Sing of His faithfulness, pouring His life out unto death 
 Come you weary and He will give you rest 
 Come you who mourn, lay on His breast 
 Christ who died, risen in Paradise 
 Giver of mercy, Giver of Life 
 Sing to Jesus His is the throne 
 Now and forever, 
 He is the King of Heaven. 
 Sing to Jesus, we are His own. 
 Now and forever sing for the love our God has shown. 
 Sing to Jesus, Lord of our shame 
 Lord of our sinful hearts. 
 He is our great Redeemer. 
 Sing to Jesus, Honor His name. 
 Sing to Jesus His is the throne 
 Now and forever, 
 He is the King of Heaven. 
 Sing to Jesus, we are His own. 
 Now and forever sing for the love our God has shown.

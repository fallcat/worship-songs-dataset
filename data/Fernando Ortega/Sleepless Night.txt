Another sleepless night 
 I'm turning in my bed 
 Long before the red sun rises 
 In these early hours 
 I'm falling again 
 Into the river of my worries 
 When the river runs away 
 I find a shelter in your name 
 Jesus, only light on the shore 
 Only hope in the storm 
 Jesus, let me fly to Your side 
 There I would hide, Jesus 
 Hear my anxious prayer 
 The beating of my heart 
 The pulse and the measure of my unbelief 
 Speak Your words to me 
 Before I come apart 
 Help me believe in what I cannot see 
 Before the river runs away 
 I will call upon your name 
 Jesus, only light on the shore 
 Only hope in the storm 
 Jesus, let me fly to Your side 
 There I would hide, Jesus 
 Jesus, only light on the shore 
 Only hope in the storm 
 Jesus, let me fly to Your side 
 There I would hide 
 Jesus, only light on the shore 
 Only hope in the storm 
 Jesus, let me fly to Your side 
 There I would hide, Jesus

Sometimes it takes a storm 
 To really know the light 
 The scent of rain 
 The weight of clouds 
 Pulling down the sky 
 Sometimes it takes a storm 
 To know how you feel 
 To understand indigo 
 And the varnished sun 
 Lighting up the fields 
 It takes the rain between the lines to know what sorrow finds 
 The way a cloud divides sometimes 
 The clearing and the blue 
 I love you 
 I was just passing through 
 And taken by surprise 
 Between the black sky 
 And the blue 
 Between the black sky and the blue 
 I love you 
 I love you

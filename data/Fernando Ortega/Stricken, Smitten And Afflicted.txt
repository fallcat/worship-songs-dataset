Stricken, Smitten, and Afflicted, 
 See him dying on the tree 
 Tis' the Christ by man rejected, 
 Yes my soul tis he 'tis He 
 Tis the long Expected prophet 
 David's Son yet David's Lord 
 By His Son God has now spoken 
 Tis the true and faithful Word 
 Tell me ye who hear him groaning, 
 Was there ever grief like his 
 Friends through fear, his cause disowning 
 Foes insulting his distress 
 Many hands were raised to wound Him 
 None would interpose to save 
 But the deepest stroke that pierced Him 
 Was the stroke that justice gave 
 Ye who think of sin but lightly 
 Nor suppose the evil great 
 Here may view its nature rightly 
 Here its guilt may estimate 
 Mark the Sacrifice Appointed 
 See who bears the awful load 
 Tis the Word, the Lord's Annointed 
 Son of Man and Son of God 
 Here we have a firm foundation 
 Here the refuge of the lost 
 Christ the Rock of our Salvation 
 His the name of which we boast 
 Lamb of God for sinners wounded 
 Sacrificed to cancel guilt 
 None shall ever be confounded 
 Who on Him their hope have built

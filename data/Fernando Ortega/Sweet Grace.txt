I thought I heard your voice 
 Last night 
 Carried on the wind, 
 Singing lines from old songs, 
 Calling out all our names again. 
 I would have followed you 
 All the way back home 
 To where our lives were long 
 As bending rivers in the sun. 
 Sweet Grace, mi alma Linda, 
 I sing this song for you 
 Sweet Grace, 
 And I imagine Heaven singing too, 
 Singing out for you. 
 I dream of your adobe house 
 Small beneath the stars - 
 The river and the silver moon 
 Behind the crumbling barn. 
 I dream of beaded necklaces 
 Sparkling on your skin, 
 The aspens turning golden 
 In the gray September rain. 
 Sweet Grace, 
 These memories bring me 
 Close to you once more, 
 Your stories and your gentle laughter 
 Calling from your door. 
 Sweet Grace, mi alma Linda, 
 I sing this song for you, 
 And I imagine Heaven singing, 
 Angels dancing too, 
 Dancing right along with you. 
 Dancing along with you. 
 I dream of the 
 Golden melting sunlight 
 The blue and silver moon 
 Sweet Grace, sweet Grace 
 I thought I heard your voice 
 Last night 
 Call your children home 
 Sweet Grace

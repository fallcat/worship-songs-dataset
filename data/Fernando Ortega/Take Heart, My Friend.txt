Take heart, my friend, we'll go together 
 This uncertain road that lies ahead 
 Our faithful God has always gone before us 
 And He will lead the way once again 
 Take heart, my friend, we can walk together 
 And if our burdens become too great 
 We can hold up and help one another 
 In God's love and God's grace 
 Take heart, my friend, the Lord is with us 
 As He has been all the days of our lives 
 Our assurance every morning 
 Our defender in the night 
 If we should falter when trouble surrounds us 
 When the wind and the waves are wild and high 
 We will look away to Him who ruled the waters 
 Who spoke His peace into the angry tide 
 He is our comfort, our sustainer 
 He is our help in time of need 
 When we wander, He is our Shepherd 
 He who watches over us never sleeps 
 Take heart, my friend, the Lord is with us 
 As He has been all the days of our lives 
 Our assurance every morning 
 Our defender in the night

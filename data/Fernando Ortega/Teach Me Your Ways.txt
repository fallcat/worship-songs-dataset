Teach me Your ways, oh Lord 
 And I will walk in Your truth 
 Give me an undivided heart 
 That I might fear Your name 
 Teach me Your ways, oh Lord 
 Grant me a humble heart 
 Counsel me in Your wisdom 
 That I might see Your face 
 I will praise You, oh Lord, my God 
 I will praise You with all my heart 
 I will glorify Your name forever 
 Teach me Your ways, oh Lord 
 Teach me Your ways, oh Lord

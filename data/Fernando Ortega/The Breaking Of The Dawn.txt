There's a slow train 
 Pulling through the desert 
 The colored cars pass quietly from sight 
 Between the highway and the long horizon 
 Precious dreams wind away with the light. 
 My brother's and my sisters' faces linger 
 The hours of our childhood, grave and gold 
 Driving through these solitary places 
 Memories of their gentile kinship 
 Touch my soul 
 The hawk wheels away as we pass here 
 The clouds billow up and fly on 
 Down the road some hard turns 
 Are going to shake us 
 Ride with us 
 Through the breaking of the dawn 
 Worry for my loving mother 
 The dimming years, 
 The trials she has known 
 Her heart so kind and so weary 
 Keep her safe one more night 
 Till I get home 
 How I long to be right there beside her 
 And bring everything back to before 
 We'll arrive with the first light of morning 
 Keep her safe, let me hold her once more 
 The sage and Joshua tree remind me 
 Of the miles to go, 
 The journey that we're on 
 In the still, sweet air of the desert 
 We will ride 
 Through the breaking of the dawn

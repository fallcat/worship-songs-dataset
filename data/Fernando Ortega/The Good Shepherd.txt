I Am the Good Shepherd; 
 I lay down my life for you; 
 Enter in 
 I Am the Good Shepherd; 
 As the Father knows me 
 I know you 
 And no one can take you away 
 You are the Good Shepherd; 
 You lay down your life for me; 
 Enter in 
 You are the Good Shepherd; 
 As the Father knows you 
 You know me 
 And no one can take you away

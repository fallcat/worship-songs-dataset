Would you be free from the burden of sin? 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 Would you o'er evil a victory win? 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the blood of the Lamb; 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the precious blood of the Lamb. 
 Would you be free from your passion and pride? 
 There's pow'r in the blood; 
 Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide; 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the blood of the Lamb; 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the precious blood of the Lamb. 
 Would you be whiter much whiter than snow? 
 There's pow'r in the blood; 
 Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow; 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There's pow'r in the blood 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the blood of the Lamb; 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the precious blood of the Lamb. 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the blood of the Lamb; 
 There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r 
 In the precious blood of the Lamb.

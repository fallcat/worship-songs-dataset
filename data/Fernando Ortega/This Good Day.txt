Morning sun and morning glories 
 Pouring down the hill 
 Through my window 
 I can feel the ocean breeze 
 Noisy sparrows fill the oak trees 
 Swallows can’t stay still 
 And in the glad commotion 
 Lord, You speak to me 
 If rain clouds come 
 Or the cold winds blow 
 You’re the One who goes before me 
 And in my heart I know 
 That this good day, it is a gift from You 
 The world is turning in its place 
 Because You made it to. 
 I lift my voice to sing a song of praise 
 On this good day. 
 I will walk to woodman’s cove 
 The fishing boats are leaving 
 Seagulls follow just above the water 
 I will wait until the sunset 
 Brings them home again, 
 Rigging lines and anchors in the harbor. 
 If rain clouds come 
 Or the cold winds blow 
 You’re the One who goes before me 
 In my heart I know 
 That this good day, it is a gift from You 
 The world is turning in its place 
 Because You made it to. 
 I lift my voice to sing a song of praise 
 On this good day. 
 If rain clouds come 
 Or the cold winds blow 
 You’re the One who goes before me 
 And in my heart I know 
 That this good day, it is a gift from You 
 The world is turning in its place 
 Because You made it to 
 This good day, it is a gift from You 
 The world is turning in its place 
 Because You made it to. 
 I lift my voice to sing a song of praise 
 On this good day.

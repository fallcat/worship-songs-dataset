Turn up the lights so we can see 
 The red-head grandson on your knee 
 Better hold him while you can 
 He'll be walking soon 
 This time next year you'll want to take him 
 Down the old road behind your house 
 To show him the sun on the autumn fields 
 To smell the wind-blown alfalfa 
 To look out where the geese are rising 
 For their southern flight 
 Circling arrows in the sky 
 Above the ditches and the cottonwood 
 This time next year 
 There'll be stories to tell 
 And he will listen to you, quiet in your arms 
 And there'll be songs to sing him 
 While he goes to sleep 
 When we gather in your home 
 This time next year 
 The boy is laughing on your knee 
 Hold him up so we can see 
 Hold him high because we're lifted 
 In his laughter 
 And in the gladness he has brought you 
 As you walk these heavy lives 
 This time next year 
 There'll be stories to tell 
 And he will listen to you, quiet in your arms 
 And there'll be songs to sing him 
 While he goes to sleep 
 When we gather in your home 
 This time next year 
 This time next year 
 There'll be stories to tell 
 And he will listen to you, quiet in your arms 
 And there'll be songs to sing him 
 While he goes to sleep 
 When we gather in your home 
 This time next year

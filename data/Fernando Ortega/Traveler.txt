Neon lights Flickering 
 Outside the caf√© 
 Ice on the windshield 
 Stars in a black sea 
 On a winter road 
 Flurries of snow 
 I'm ready to go 
 Past farmhouse and pasture 
 Our voices together 
 Rise to the drumming 
 Of big-rigs and trailers 
 Long hours to daylight 
 A rumbling bus 
 Our bed and our board 
 Heavenly father 
 Remember the traveler 
 Bring us safely home 
 Heavenly father 
 Remember the traveler 
 Bring us safely home 
 Safely home 
 In the towns of this highway 
 The people are kind 
 They welcome us in 
 I sing in their church halls 
 Old hymns and prayer songs 
 With lifted hearts 
 We rejoice in the Lord 
 Heavenly father 
 Remember the traveler 
 Bring us safely home 
 Heavenly father 
 Remember the traveler 
 Bring us safely home 
 Safely home 
 I long for my family 
 And friends to remind me 
 Of where I have been 
 And where I am going 
 And where I came from 
 Heavenly father 
 Remember the traveler 
 Bring us safely home 
 Heavenly father 
 Remember the traveler 
 Bring us safely home 
 Safely home

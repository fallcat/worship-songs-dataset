She's a bird song high up in the hickories 
 She's a river running on to the silver sea 
 She's a starlight on a summer evening 
 A little rose, my Virginia, she's a rose 
 We went walking by the shady harpeth 
 The morning wind blew her hair across her face 
 She held my hand, I whispered her name 
 She's my rose, sweet Virginia, she's my rose 
 Yesterday I rode the late bus from Tupelo 
 And in the long night I thought of all the miles to go 
 I closed my eyed and dreamed of my good home 
 And my rose, I dreamed of my Virginia rose 
 She's a rose, my Virginia, she's a rose

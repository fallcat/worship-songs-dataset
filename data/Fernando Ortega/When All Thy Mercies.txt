When all Thy mercies, O my God, 
 My rising soul surveys, 
 Transported with the view I'm lost 
 In wonder, love, and praise. 
 Unnumbered comforts to my soul 
 Thy tender care bestowed 
 Before my infant heart could know 
 From whom those comforts flowed 
 When worn with sickness, oft hast Thou, 
 With health renewed my face, 
 And when in sins and sorrows bowed, 
 Revived my soul with grace. 
 Through every period of my life 
 Thy goodness I'll pursue, 
 And after death, in distant worlds, 
 The glorious theme renew

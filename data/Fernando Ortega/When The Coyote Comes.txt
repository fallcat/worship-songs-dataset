Midnight in the yard 
 A dog begins to bark 
 The next-door neighbor 
 Shuts her kitchen blinds 
 Up on the moonlit rise 
 Joe-Jack sleeps outside 
 On an old gunnysack 
 Filled with soda cans 
 Out across the lawn 
 2 cats have their fun 
 Epi and Lou on the slippery grass 
 They tumble and jump in a crazy dance 
 Look up at the stars like they're in a trance 
 Climb the willow tree 
 Epi and Louie freeze 
 They don't blink or breathe 
 A sudden danger 
 In the atmosphere 
 Walking down the road 
 Sniffing as he goes 
 An old coyote 
 His eyes are yellow green 
 Trickster on the prowl 
 Throws back his head and howls 
 The night heats up when the coyote comes 
 He won't rest till his work is done 
 Critters flee when he comes around 
 Some won't make it home 
 Life is never what it seems 
 Pull me from this waking dream 
 I should have come inside 
 So much guilt, so much regret 
 Don't let my life be over 
 Let me come inside 
 I wanna come inside 
 Epi and Lou run across the yard 
 They look to the window but it's much too far 
 They turn and race for the broken car 
 Barely make it in 
 The night heats up when the coyote comes 
 He won't rest till his work is done 
 Every critter flees when he comes around 
 Some won't make it home

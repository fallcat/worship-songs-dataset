Thrushes stir in the trees, 
 And hide from the moonlight 
 High on the stony ridge, all is still 
 The whole world is waiting 
 Silent as the icy stars 
 A holy winter 
 To cheer our darkened hearts 
 Jesus our Lord and King, born in a stable 
 Wrapped in rags asleep on a bed of straw 
 Though He is from heaven 
 Still it is enough for Him 
 He who made the mountains 
 And will come again to reign 
 Oh blessed night 
 Bright angels, are singing 
 For heaven's light 
 Is lying in a manger bed 
 Sweet Mary she kisses His head 
 And sings a lullaby 
 Oh boundless mercy of God, beautiful mystery 
 The braying donkeys, sheep and birds of the air 
 And shepherds and sages 
 All have come this night 
 To welcome Him 
 Redeemer of the world 
 Oh blessed night 
 Bright angels, are singing 
 For heaven's light 
 Is lying in a manger bed 
 Sweet Mary she kisses His head 
 And sings a lullaby

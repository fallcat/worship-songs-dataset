When fear feels bigger than my faith 
 And struggles steal my breath away 
 When my back's pressed up against the wall 
 With the weight of my worries stacked up tall 
 You're strong enough to hold it all 
 I will cast my cares on You 
 You're the anchor of my hope 
 The only one who's in control 
 I will cast my cares on You 
 I'll trade the troubles of this world 
 For Your peace inside my soul 
 This war's not what I would've chosen 
 But You see the future no one knows yet 
 And there's still good when I can't 
 See the working of Your hands 
 You're holding it all 
 I will cast my cares on You 
 You're the anchor of my hope 
 The only one who's in control 
 I will cast my cares on You 
 I'll trade the troubles of this world 
 For Your peace inside my soul 
 I'm finding there's freedom 
 When I lay it all on Your shoulders 
 Cast my cares 
 I will 
 Cast my cares 
 I will 
 Cast my cares on You

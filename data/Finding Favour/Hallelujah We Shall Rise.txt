I can almost hear Your voice 
 I can almost hear Your song 
 Singing out from the heavens 
 That it's time to come home 
 And Hallelujah! We shall rise 
 And Hallelujah! We shall sing 
 When we hear Your voice cry 
 We will wake from the night 
 And Hallelujah! We shall rise 
 You will be brighter than the sun 
 It will be darkness no more 
 What a day that will be 
 When we finally meet You Lord 
 And Hallelujah! We shall rise 
 And Hallelujah! We shall sing 
 When we hear Your voice cry 
 We will wake from the night 
 And Hallelujah! We shall rise 
 We will rise above the heavens 
 We will rise above it all 
 We will run like a child into Your open arms 
 When we get to where we're going 
 We'll have all that we've been waiting for 
 When we finally reach that place 
 When we fall before Your throne 
 There will be no more pain 
 And all our sorrows will be gone 
 And Hallelujah! We shall rise 
 And Hallelujah! We shall sing 
 When we hear Your voice cry 
 We will wake from the night 
 And Hallelujah! We shall rise 
 (x2) 
 When we hear Your voice cry 
 We will wake from the night 
 And Hallelujah! We shall rise

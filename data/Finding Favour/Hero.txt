She is a soldier and a fighter 
 On the front lines of a war 
 Caught in the shrapnel and the battle 
 Kneeling down on her bedroom floor 
 Standing between you and the fallout 
 She will not give up this ground 
 Oh no, you know she will never back down 
 Cause somewhere right now 
 Someone is fighting for you 
 They're crying out 
 Won't stop until they breakthrough 
 You see an unassuming ordinary simple soul 
 And you'd never know 
 Somewhere right now you've got a hero 
 Have you ever been there when the darkness almost closes in? 
 Then all of the sudden there's a moment 
 When the light comes breaking in 
 And out of the shadows comes a warrior 
 With the faith to overcome 
 And you lift your eyes 
 To where your help comes from 
 Somewhere right now 
 Someone is fighting for you 
 They're crying out 
 Won't stop until they breakthrough 
 You see an unassuming ordinary simple soul 
 And you'd never know 
 Somewhere right now you've got a hero 
 When you feel alone and think nobody cares 
 Just know that you are always in my prayers 
 Somewhere right now 
 Someone is fighting for you 
 They're crying out 
 Won't stop until they breakthrough 
 You see an unassuming ordinary simple soul 
 And you'd never know 
 Somewhere right now you've got a hero

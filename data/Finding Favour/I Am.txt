While you were sleeping 
 While the whole world was dreaming 
 I never left your side 
 And I can promise I won't be leaving 
 I watch you breathing 
 And I hear you singing 
 I feel your heart beat and I know every pain 
 That you're feeling 
 And I am the comfort when you are afraid 
 I am the refuge when you call my name 
 I was, I'll be, I am 
 I know you're broken 
 You're busted wide open 
 You've fallen to pieces and you feel there's nothing left 
 You can hope in 
 But I'll hold you together 
 We'll stand the weather 
 'Cause I paid the price for you 
 And I won't let you go, no never 
 And I am the comfort when you are afraid 
 I am the refuge when you call my name 
 I was, I'll be, I am 
 And I am the future, and I am the past 
 I am the first and I am the last 
 I was, I'll be, I am 
 I am the Father, I am the Son 
 I am the Spirit, I am the One 
 I was, I'll be, I am 
 And I wore the thorns and I took the nails 
 I am love, and love never fails 
 I was, I'll be, I am 
 I am, I am, I am

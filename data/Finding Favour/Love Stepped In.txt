He was preachin' down off 3rd and main as I was passin' by 
 He was walking talking kinda crazy warnin' us all 'bout the end of time 
 So out from the crowd, I just asked him how could God love a mess like me 
 He said, "Son, I'm a preacher now but that ain't who I used to be" 
 He said 
 You'll never know, you'll never know 
 Just how far love has brought me 
 You'll never know who I used to be 
 'Cause I've been around and I've been down 
 To the bottom of hell and back again 
 I was almost out, I was at my end 
 But then love stepped in 
 She works downtown at the halfway house almost every day 
 All the love she has she just gives away 
 So I asked her why she spends so much time on the broken and the poor 
 And she just smiled at me and said "I'm not who I was before" 
 She said 
 You'll never know, you'll never know 
 Just how far love has brought me 
 You'll never know who I used to be 
 'Cause I've been around and I've been down 
 To the bottom of hell and back again 
 I was almost out, I was at my end 
 But then love stepped in 
 Love stepped in 
 I look back sometimes over where I've been and just how far I've come 
 Since the day that preacher told me about His amazing love 
 I was lost and alone, then the lights came on and hope set my heart free 
 In the darkest hour grace got a hold of me, yeah 
 You'll never know, you'll never know 
 Just how far love has brought me 
 You'll never know who I used to be, oh oh 
 'Cause I've been around and I've been down 
 To the bottom of hell and back again 
 I was almost out, I was at my end 
 But then love stepped in 
 Love stepped in

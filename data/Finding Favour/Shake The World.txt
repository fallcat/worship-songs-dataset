This is for my sisters that find yourselves confused. 
 From the magazines and movie screens telling you how to be you. 
 Oh don't you think it's time to just be free. 
 Yeah and this is for my brothers 
 Trying hard to be a man. 
 But that past you can't forget sure makes it hard for you to stand. 
 Oh don't you think it's time to just be free. 
 Ah we're free to just believe God's grace will always be enough. 
 Free to just be children wrapped up in His great love. 
 When the sons and daughters start singing this song 
 Then everybody all around 'em will be singing along. 
 It's gonna shake the world. 
 It's gonna shake the world. 
 When we all start marching to the beat of the drum. 
 That's moving to the rhythm of the Kingdom to come. 
 It's gonna shake the world. It's gonna shake shake shake the world 
 Yeah with mercy as our melody and justice as our guide. 
 We're gonna sing to all the broken that the world has cast aside. 
 Singing don't you think it's time to just be free. 
 Our God's the only God bringing hope to all the lost. 
 There's healing and forgiveness in the anthem of the cross. 
 Darkness has to tremble at the sound of His great name. 
 Every king, every ruler, bows down at Hisgreat fame. 
 There's nothing that can silence the song of the redeemed, oh.

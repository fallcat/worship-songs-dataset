There's none greater 
 Now or later 
 This I know 
 Lord of mercy 
 Light my pathway 
 Make me whole 
 (Chorus A) 
 Just a closer walk with thee 
 'Cause Your love will make the difference in me 
 There's no place I'd rather be 
 Than beneath Your wings of serenity, oh 
 So prone to stray 
 Hold me tightly 
 Don't let go 
 Shepherd lead me 
 Guide me daily 
 I am Yours 
 (Chorus B) 
 Just a closer walk with thee 
 For Your love will make the difference in me, oh Lord 
 There's no place I'd rather be 
 Than beneath Your wings of serenity, oh {Instrumental Solo}... {Don't let go} 
 On my own 
 Life for me 
 Wasn't getting better, oh 
 When Your love 
 Captured me 
 I was found forever 
 So with every... 
 (Vamp) 
 Every step Lord I take 
 Closer and closer, closer and closer 
 With every beat my heart makes 
 Lord when You hear it may it sound like Your own 
 (Repeat Vamp 1x) 
 (Vamp 2) 
 There is no living life Lord without You 
 No joy is found only sadness 
 Instead of peace there is sorrow 
 No quiet calm only madness 
 Without You, Lord without You 
 Without You, Lord without You 
 (Out)

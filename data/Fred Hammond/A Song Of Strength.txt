Hold on and wait just a little while 
 Hold on and wait just a little while 
 He'll bring a song of strength 
 Hold on and wait just a little while, little while 
 What do you do 
 When the life you've planned is shattered 
 What do you say 
 When the one you love is gone 
 How do you live 
 Seems like no hope for tomorrow 
 Pain doesn't care where you live or who you are 
 Lord You see my life is broken 
 And I don't know what to do 
 While I'm in this change, help me remain 
 I can count on You, oh, oh 
 When I can't see, I know You'll guide 
 When I cry out, I know You feel 
 Now I'm praying, I know You hear 
 Praying for healing, I know You will 
 Who do you call 
 When no one has the answer 
 Where do you go 
 When the place you've know is no more 
 When will they stop 
 All the tears they just keep falling 
 Pain doesn't care where you live or who you are 
 (Channel) 
 We ask you to forgive 
 And we will do the same 
 We receive Your love 
 Lord we'll take time to heal 
 (Vamp) 
 Hold on and wait just a little while 
 He'll bring a song of strength in the midnight 
 Touch our lives with Your loving Hand 
 Hold on, we'll hold on 
 (Repeat) 
 Hold on and wait just a little while 
 (Repeat)

Falling apart and tearing at the seams 
 Tribulation lends a hand and squeezes all your hopes, your dreams 
 You say you retreat, you say you just can't win 
 Before you let your circumstance tell you how the story ends 
 His word says you can stand 
 He'll cover you with His grace 
 Everything you need is in your hand 
 So lift up your head and say 
 All things are working for me even things I can't see 
 Your ways are so beyond me 
 But You said that You would let it be for my good 
 So I'll rest and just believe 
 I know you think you've got it bad right now 
 But let me say I know that feeling well 
 To make good plans for life 
 And then watch them take a downward spin 
 Let me encourage you while I encourage me 
 He sees the raging rain and wind 
 But He'll speak peace and it will come to an end 
 The truth is He cannot lie 
 I'm in His hands and I'm on his mind 
 He promised me He'd always be there 
 So by faith He will answer my prayer 
 All things are working for me even things I can't see 
 Your ways are so beyond me 
 But You said that You would let it be for my good 
 So I'll rest and just believe 
 Many days and nights I cried 
 Because I felt let down, let down, let down 
 But I won't always receive good, I know 
 But a praise in my heart will remain, oh 
 So with tears in our eyes 
 Know sometimes it will get rougher 
 But say, Lord, I love you more 
 And that is enough to know 
 All things are working for me even things I can't see 
 Your ways are so beyond me 
 But You said that You would let it be for my good 
 So I'll rest and just believe 
 [Incomprehensible] everything, you must believe 
 Even things I can't see 
 Your ways are so beyond me 
 But You said that You would let it be for my good 
 So I'll rest and just believe

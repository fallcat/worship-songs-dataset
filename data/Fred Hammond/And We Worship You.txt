Inadequate, insufficient 
 At a loss and very few 
 Are all the words I possess at this time 
 That describe my love for You, Lord 
 So I lift my hands and worship You 
 Worship You 
 My heart so full, it overflows 
 As it brings a few to me 
 You're beautiful, marvelous, wonderful 
 You are everything I need 
 As I stand in awe and I worship You 
 'Cause You are the Lord of glory 
 The bright and morning star 
 And there is no one like You 
 And we worship You 
 You are the living water 
 That flows from Calvary 
 A precious healing fountain 
 And we worship You, oh, Lord 
 Can I get someone to help me? 
 Before Your throne I boldly stand 
 To thank You for every success 
 I bring to You each victory 
 But bring also my brokenness 
 Now in humility will I worship You, oh, Lord? 
 You are, You are the Lord of glory 
 The bright and morning star 
 And there is none like You 
 And we worship You 
 You are the living water 
 That flows from Calvary 
 A precious healing fountain 
 And we worship You 
 You are the risen Savior 
 The Lord of all I am 
 The King of all creation 
 And we worship You 
 You are the Lord of glory 
 The bright and morning star 
 And there is none like You 
 And we worship You 
 You are the living water 
 That flows from Calvary 
 A precious healing fountain 
 And we worship You 
 You are the risen Savior 
 The Lord of all I am 
 The King of all creation 
 And we worship You, oh, Lord 
 Lord, we worship You

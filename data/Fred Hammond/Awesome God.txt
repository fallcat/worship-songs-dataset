Listen up, let me tell everybody 
 About my God who reigns 
 Can boast just little bit 'bout His holy name 
 He controls the whole universe 
 But cares enough to fill my cup 
 So shout to the Lord, sing along with me 
 And lift the praises up, you say, yeah 
 What is behind these words I say? 
 And what makes me feels this way? 
 He's an awesome God 
 God, God, God, God, God, God 
 Let me remind you just who 
 He is and how His power flows 
 He healed the sick and He raised the dead up 
 From the grave He rose 
 He took the nails and He shed His blood 
 To prove His soul back His way 
 So all the power we need to live blessing Jesus name

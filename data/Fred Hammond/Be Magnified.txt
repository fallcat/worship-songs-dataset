I have made You too small in my eyes 
 Oh Lord, forgive me 
 And I have believed in a lie 
 That You are unable to help me. 
 But now, Oh Lord, I see my wrong 
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong 
 And in my eyes and with my song 
 Oh Lord, be magnified (bis) 
 Be magnified, Oh Lord 
 You are highly exalted 
 And there is nothing You can't do 
 Oh Lord, my eyes are on You 
 Be magnified, 
 Oh Lord, be magnified 
 I have leaned on a wisdom of men 
 Oh Lord, please forgive me 
 And I have responded to them 
 Instead of Your light and Your mercy 
 But now, Oh Lord, I see my wrong 
 Heal my heart and show yourself strong 
 And in my eyes and in my song 
 Oh Lord be magnified (bis)

Lost in despair 
 Searching high and low, here and there 
 Wondering if anyone cares 
 All that you're going through 
 Who will be there for you? 
 Hard times you've faced 
 Reminding you of all your mistakes 
 Is there really a brighter day 
 When will the drama cease? 
 Will there ever be peace? 
 There is a love 
 A love that looks beyond my faults 
 A love so true 
 The only love that's meant for you 
 Let me offer this love to you 
 I guarantee that He will be faithful and true 
 This love isn't like anything that you've ever known 
 He has a better love, better love 
 I know you've probably heard it before 
 When someone can give you love, affection and more 
 But this love I offer you will come through for sure 
 He has a better love, better love 
 I have been there 
 Feeling that there's no one to care 
 Believing that life is so unfair 
 Thinking they'll never be 
 Someone that's good to me 
 So please believe 
 Open up your heart and receive 
 I said this love covers complete 
 His love is for everyone 
 No matter what you've done 
 I've tried Him and I know it 
 I've tried Him and I know it 
 I've tried Him, I know it 
 He won't let you down 
 Always be around 
 When your friends walk out 
 He will be there for you

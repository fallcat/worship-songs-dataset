When the battle makes me weary 
 It seems that I've lost ground 
 It's so hard to hear Your voice Lord 
 With distractions all around 
 I try to lift my hands, to give You praise 
 But then a spirit of heaviness 
 Tries to shield Your face, so I'm saying breathe 
 Breathe into me oh Lord, the breath of life 
 So that my spirit would be whole 
 And my soul made right 
 Breathe into me oh Lord, day by day 
 So that my heart is pure before You, always, always 
 Unto Thee oh Lord do I lift up my soul 
 It's only by Your hand 
 That I can be made whole 
 So Lord breathe on me 
 And revive my spirit within 
 And I'll never be the same 
 Condemnation tries to hold me 
 Like a prisoner in chains 
 And the weight of my burdens 
 Is calling out my name 
 That's when I lift up my voice worship You 
 Because I know 
 You promised You would wash me 
 Jesus wash me white as snow 
 Unto Thee oh Lord do I lift up my soul 
 It's only by Your hand, that I can be made whole 
 So Lord let Your breath revive me again 
 And I'll never be the same 
 I will never be the same, I will never be the same

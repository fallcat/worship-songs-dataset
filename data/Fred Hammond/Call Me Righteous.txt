I'm not the same 
 I was lost, didn't know my future 
 So alone, couldn't see who He was 
 But He chose me, changed my life completely 
 Fixed my heart, cleansed me and made me Holy 
 It was no good that I've done 
 To make You call me one of Your sons 
 Couldn't pay the price to save my life 
 But You took the cost, and found what was lost 
 Call me righteous, since He changed my nature 
 Call me righteous, changed my name 
 Call me righteous, I'm a brad new creature 
 Call me righteous, I'm not the same 
 I can't believe, He knew all about me 
 Still he loved me, enough to forgive me 
 I never thought, my name would be royal 
 Since He gave, I will give Him all 
 (Vamp) 
 Baptized me, justified me, purified me 
 When He changed my nature 
 Sanctified me, glorified me 
 When He changed my name 
 He just called me righteous, say 
 (Repeat) 
 For by grace we are saved 
 It's a grace thing, my name has been changed 
 He just called me righteous, say 
 (Repeat)

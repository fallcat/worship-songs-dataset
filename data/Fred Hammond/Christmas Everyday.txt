Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on 
 Never go away 
 Gotta be something about this time of year 
 That makes everybody act just a little more sincere 
 There's nothing like stepping outside 
 To exchange a neighbor's smile 
 Or just shaking hands a little longer, maybe talk a while 
 Lugging shopping bags down the street 
 Making time to speak to everybody that you meet 
 Making the cruise through the old neighborhood 
 Just taking in who's decorated and it's all good 
 I wish that Christmas would be everyday 
 Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on 
 Why does this feeling have to go away? 
 If it were up to me, the season would never change 
 It would always stay the same 
 I had to stop over my mom's crib the other day 
 'Cause she's getting older now, gotta make sure she's okay 
 A smile and a hug would do her heart some good 
 Just chilling with family on Christmas like a family should 
 I am grateful for all that God has given me 
 I'm compelled to go help somebody else in need 
 Come back home and in for the night 
 Telling the kids the season's really all about Christ 
 I wish that Christmas would be everyday 
 Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on 
 Why does this feeling have to go away? 
 If it were up to me, the season would never change 
 It would always stay the same, the same, the same 
 Why can't we show each other the same love? 
 The same, the same good love, real love 
 To me, once a year is really not enough 
 I wish that Christmas would be everyday 
 Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on 
 Why does this feeling have to go away? 
 If it were up to me, the season would never change 
 It would always stay the same 
 I wish that Christmas would be everyday 
 Let it go on and on, and on 
 Why does this feeling had to go away? 
 If it were up to me, the season would never change 
 It would always stay the same 
 On and on, on and on, and on, say

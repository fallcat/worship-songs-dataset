Now we are gathered here 
 This time is sanctified 
 We drink of the rain and eat the bread 
 For our iniquities his body was bruised 
 And for our peace his blood was shead 
 But we gather not in sorrow 
 To commemorate (ah) 
 That he died to bring us 
 Back to the father 
 What you must realize 
 Its time to eat the bread 
 And drink against of 
 The bonds was set 
 That you agree with every word 
 That's in this eat 
 And that you embrace the masters hand 
 But its only to remind you 
 The law has been fulfilled (ah) 
 A new covenant abides 
 And that held is broken 
 We're trapped no longer inside 
 Chorus [3] (repeat 2x) 
 So eat the bread 
 And drink the wine 
 So we can have 
 Sweet Communion 
 He gave his life 
 Once for all time 
 So we can have 
 Sweet Communion 
 Voice 
 For I received from the Lord 
 What I also pass unto you: 
 The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed 
 Took bread, and when he had given thanks 
 He broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you 
 Do this in remembrance of me." 
 In the same way after supper he took the cup saying, 
 "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, whenever 
 You drink, in remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this 
 Bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lord's death, until he 
 Arose.

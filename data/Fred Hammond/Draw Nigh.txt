Lord my heart chases after Thee 
 How shall I draw You close to me 
 A broken spirit and a contrite heart 
 To this You will draw, And I'll draw nigh 
 I will draw nigh to You and You will draw nigh unto me 
 I'll sing a serenade while tears of joy wash my face 
 You are my reward nothing else compares to You 
 Lord my God and my salvation 
 I'll draw nigh to You, I'll draw nigh to You 
 Craving righteousness, I'm thirsty for Your presence 
 With all I have, I'll worship the beauty of Your holiness 
 A broken spirit and a contrite heart 
 To this You will draw nigh, And I'll draw nigh 
 I will draw nigh 
 I will draw nigh 
 I will draw' nigh 
 (Repeat) 
 Closer near you, to be in Your glory 
 Closer near you to fulfill my joy 
 (Repeat)

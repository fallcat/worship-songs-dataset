He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High 
 Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty 
 Whatever storms arise won't move me 
 Because my eyes are stayed on Him, He is my King 
 Don't you know, don't you know, hey 
 He delivers me from the hand of the enemy 
 And every plague that shall arise, yeah 
 Under His wings I can seek safety 
 For His faithfulness is a shield for my life 
 Oh what peace it is to know 
 That He is wherever I go, wherever I go 
 There is nothing that He can't see 
 And in Him I have victory 
 (Chorus A) 
 I can dwell (dwell), I can dwell (dwell) 
 In my Savior there is safety 
 And there is no other place 
 In Him I dwell 
 (Chorus B) 
 Whether I move to the mountain or the valley 
 Abiding in You is the safest place only 
 I've found in You a mighty strong tower 
 And that's the place where I choose to dwell 
 I call on Him and He answers me 
 And delivers me on the double, yeah 
 He sets His love on me and He hears me constantly 
 And saves me from each and every trouble 
 (Repeat Pre-Chorus) 
 (Repeat Chorus A) 
 (Repeat Chorus B) 
 (Vamp) 
 I live I move and I have my being (Repeat) 
 As long as I stay in Him 
 As long as I stay 
 (Repeat) 
 Shelter (Repeat)

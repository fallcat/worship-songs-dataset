Lord I'm standing here 
 And I don't know what to do 
 The enemy has said 
 Give up 'cause I am through 
 So I just lift up my hands 
 And do what I know best 
 Give you praise 
 Worthy, worthy Lord you are. 
 I'll praise you with my whole heart 
 I'll sing of your goodness unto me 
 And I'll bless your name 
 When I'm afraid 'cause I know 
 You are my dwelling place 
 You are my light, my love, my song 
 My deliverer 
 When I am overwhelmed 
 I will rest in you 
 I'm not gonna look back 
 Even though I feel I'm done 
 Gonna stand and fight 
 Even though I wanna run 
 'Cause I hear your word tell me 
 To stand until the end 
 My enemies can cause my tears to fall 
 But you can save me from them all 
 I'll sing of your goodness unto me 
 And I'll bless your name 
 When I'm afraid 
 You are my dwelling place 
 You are my light, my love, my song 
 My deliverer 
 When I am overwhelmed 
 I will rest in you 
 For you are my peace Lord 
 In your presence I am saved 
 Lord you are my dwelling place 
 You are my dwelling place 
 You are my light, my love, my song 
 My deliverer 
 When I am overwhelmed 
 I will rest in you 
 For you are my peace Lord 
 In your presence I am saved 
 Lord you are my dwelling place 
 You oh Lord are my sword 'n' shield 
 To you oh Lord does my spirit yield 
 Under your wing, my secret place 
 In your name I run and I am saved 
 For You are... My dwelling 
 You are my dwelling place 
 You are my light, my love, my song 
 My deliverer 
 For You are... My dwelling 
 For You are... My dwelling {X4}

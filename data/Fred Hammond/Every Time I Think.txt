Every time I think about what You've done 
 I get overwhelmed, get beside myself 
 From my heart I've got to let all my praises flow 
 'Cause I gotta let You know that I love You so 
 Let me thank You in my life for all You've done for me 
 Because You've made an awesome friend [Incomprehensible] 
 You took Your nail scarred hands and wrapped them around me 
 To give me joy and victory, and sing a song 'I've been redeemed' 
 Every time I think about what You've done 
 I get overwhelmed, get beside myself 
 From my heart I've got to let all my praises flow 
 'Cause I gotta let You know that I love You so 
 So now You know our plan, shouldn't be no big surprise 
 You see my hands go up and if you look in my eyes 
 It's because the Savior of the world, He called me His own 
 I feel enough that as His son, I've access to the throne 
 Every time I think about what You've done 
 I get overwhelmed, get beside myself 
 From my heart I've got to let all my praises flow 
 'Cause I gotta let You know that I love You so 
 Every time I think, every time I think 
 I get overwhelmed, get beside myself 
 So from my heart I've got to let my, let my praises 
 I gotta let You know that I love You so 
 Lord, I know you know that how I really feel 
 But let me take this time to tell you in my own words 
 You've been mighty good, mighty good, mighty good to me 
 You've been mighty good, mighty good, mighty good to me 
 You, You blessed me over and over 
 And You held me when I was lonely 
 And You fill me with Your precious spirit 
 Not to worship You, You know I just ain't having it 
 Lord, I know you know that how I really feel 
 But let me take this time to tell you in my words 
 You've been mighty good, mighty good, mighty good to me 
 You've been mighty good, mighty good, mighty good to me 
 You blessed me over and over 
 And You held me when I was lonely 
 You fill me with Your precious spirit 
 Not to worship You, Lord, I just wouldn't have it 
 Lord, I know you know that how I really feel 
 But let me take this time to tell you in my words 
 You've been mighty good, mighty good, mighty good to me 
 You've been mighty good, mighty good, mighty good to me 
 You blessed me over and over 
 And You held me when I was lonely 
 You fill me with Your precious spirit 
 Not to worship You, Lord, I just wouldn't have it, no 
 You blessed me over and over 
 Over and over, over and over 
 You fill me with Your precious spirit 
 Not to worship You, Lord, I just wouldn't have it, no

Everything To Me By Fred Hammond 
 My future and my history 
 My freedom and my liberty 
 My strength my joy 
 My life, my peace 
 Oh Lord You're everything to me 
 My flame, my light 
 My lamp, my heat 
 Brighten my path to guide my feet 
 Anoint my head and fill my cup 
 Oh Lord You're everything to me 
 Everything to me 
 Everything to me 
 Everything to me 
 Everything 
 Channel 
 When I felt lost and alone 
 You came and changed my story 
 On the pages of my life 
 You have revealed Your glory 
 Oh Lord You're everything to me 
 My start, my now 
 My close, my end 
 The Lover of my soul, my friend 
 Oh Lord You are my everything 
 My Father, God 
 My Lord and King 
 You heal and cause 
 Life to increase 
 You are the cure for my disease 
 My purpose and my destiny 
 Oh Lord You're everything to me 
 Repeat chorus, channel 
 VAMP: Everything to me 
 Repeat

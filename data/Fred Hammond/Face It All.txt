From my heart here is what I need to say 
 From now on and until my dying day 
 My love is here to stay, my heart has found its place 
 You say you feel this too, so whatever we go through 
 Hand in hand, we can stand and face it all 
 You're my heart and I'm your man, we'll face it all 
 To say our life will all be smiles would be untrue 
 We've had our share of heartache and pain but our love has brought us through 
 So let's say on this day, together we will stay 
 If life is good and gold or if tears fall down our face 
 Hand in hand, we can stand and face it all 
 You're my heart and I'm your man girl, we'll face it all 
 We'll trust the Lord and He will be our guide and we can face it all 
 We can face it all 
 Side by side, you and I will face it all 
 We'll face it all 
 Just keep your hand in mine girl 
 And we'll make it through whatever, comes our way 
 We'll take it day by day 
 Together you and I, together side by side, we'll face it all 
 We'll face everything that comes our way 
 As long as we're together, I know that we can l make it 
 'Cause I love you, I know you love me too 
 We can win, we can win, we can win girl 
 We can win girl and face it all, we'll face it all 
 No weapon formed against us can ever separate us 
 If we believe and we should be, side by side, side by side 
 We can make it girl, oh we'll face it all 
 Oh, we'll face it all 
 With every tear we cry, we'll hold each other tight 
 We'll trust the Lord, we'll trust Him to bring us through 
 Together you and I, hand in hand, side by side, we'll face it all

Give me a clean heart 
 To see You like I should, hey 
 To walk the path that's right 
 To do the thing You would 
 Give me a clean heart and I will serve nobody, but You 
 Give me a clean heart 
 To lose the double mind 
 To believe You when You tell me 
 Everything will be just fine 
 Just lay Your hands on me Lord 
 And I will be brand new 
 (Chorus A) 
 And I am calling out to You for a strength exchange 
 I will gladly take Your joy for my weakness 
 Give me a clean heart and I will serve nobody, but You 
 (Give me a clean heart and I will serve nobody but You) 
 {Hey, yeah let the band play for two now, come on now} 
 Give me a clean heart 
 A better one I pray 
 To stay on the path You've chosen 
 And stick with it all the way 
 Give me a clean heart and I will serve nobody, but You 
 Give me a clean heart 
 I'm coming now to You 
 To keep my heart from fainting 
 This is all I know to do 
 Just lay Your hands on me Lord 
 And I will be brand new 
 (Chorus B) 
 And I am worshiping Your great and holy name 
 I'm determined to have life with no chains 
 Give me a clean heart and I will serve nobody but You 
 (Give me a clean heart and I will serve nobody but You) 
 {Noel won't you play now, won't you play now, now, now}

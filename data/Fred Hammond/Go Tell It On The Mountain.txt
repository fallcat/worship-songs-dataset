The shepherds found King Jesus 
 In lowly Bethlehem 
 They saw a mighty Savior 
 They saw a humble Lamb 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born. 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, yeah 
 Jesus Christ is born. 
 The wise men saw the young child 
 And the star above so bright 
 They knew they'd seen the Savior 
 The one to bring us life 
 Oh, go, tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born. 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, yeah, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born. 
 The blessed celebration 
 And the heavens fill the earth 
 And was the angels singing 
 Telling of the Savior's birth 
 Won't you go 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 Go, tell it on the mountain, 
 You better go tell 
 Over the hills and everywhere, 
 Go, tell it on the mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born. 
 Go tell them one and all 
 Tell of the Savior's birth 
 Join in the angel's verse 
 Good will and peace on Earth 
 Go tell them one and all 
 Tell of the Savior's birth 
 Join in the angel's chorus 
 Good will, peace on Earth 
 Go tell them one and all 
 Tell of the Savior's birth 
 Join in the angel's chorus 
 Good will and peace on Earth 
 To men 
 Go tell 
 Go tell them one and all 
 Go tell 
 In the city of David 
 Go tell 
 Jesus Christ is born

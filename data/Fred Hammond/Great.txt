With our hearts so full of sincere exhaltation 
 We, Your people, we come before You with celebration, hey 
 (B-Section) 
 Like the angels fly around Your throne 
 We're crying Holy 
 With our whole hearts we praise You alone 
 We're crying Glory 
 As we dance before You 
 Praise You for the breakthrough 
 We sing Your praise 
 Sing because You are great 
 Celebrate Your excellent Name 
 No one like You 
 Faithful and true 
 Sing because You are great 
 Lord, we love Your name, we love Your name 
 I just praise You with sounds of Glory 
 We feel Your power this very hour 
 Send Your presence Lord just like the fresh rain begins to shower 
 (Repeat B-Section) 
 (Channel) 
 As we lift our hands up high (we bless You) 
 Truly bless You for Your presence (Lord we bless You) 
 And Your name we glorify 
 Mighty God, Mighty God 
 In the song and in the dance (forever) 
 Not ashamed to give You reverence (Lord forever) 
 And forever we will say 
 You are Great, You are Great 
 (Vamp) 
 Your Name 
 Is great 
 We Love 
 Your Name, Your Name 
 Your Name 
 Is great 
 We Love 
 Your Name, Your Name

Today is a good day 
 Wanna make it last through the night 
 It's because of your goodness and all 
 The joy you've brought to my life 
 Taking all my clouds away 
 Giving me a brighter day 
 I don't really care who knows 
 That I really love you so 
 You make me happy 
 You make me happy 
 Your love 
 It makes me feel all right 
 Through all my darkest nights 
 It keeps on holding on 
 And won't let go 
 And when I feel alone 
 Your love gives me a song 
 It keeps me moving on 
 That's why 
 You make me happy 
 You make me happy 
 If anyone asks me 
 About this smile on my face 
 (You know what I tell 'em) 
 I tell 'em the reason is all 
 The joy you brought my way 
 Taking all my clouds away 
 Giving me a brighter day 
 I don't really care who knows 
 That I really love you so 
 You make me happy 
 You make me happy 
 Lord I could always count on you 
 When I thought I was through 
 Your love was always true 
 And let me know 
 You're watching over us 
 In you I put my trust 
 You keep me moving on 
 That's why 
 You make me happy 
 You make me happy 
 (That's why I feel) 
 I feel like dancing 
 I'm so overjoyed 
 Can I talk about him (yeah!) 
 Can I give him glory (yeah!) 
 Can I give him praise (yeah!) 
 Can we say it together (yeah!) 
 He gives me joy (joy!) 
 Oh joy (joy!) 
 So much joy (joy!) 
 Joy unspeakable (joy!) 
 He gives me joy (joy!) 
 When I feel like crying (joy!) 
 He gives me joy (joy!) 
 In the morning comes joy (joy!) 
 He gives me peace (peace!) 
 So much peace (peace!) 
 When I should be going crazy (peace!) 
 He gives me peace (peace!) 
 In the midnight hour (peace!) 
 He comes and gives me peace (peace!) 
 When chaos is all around (peace!) 
 He comes and gives me (peace!) 
 And then gives me hope (hope!) 
 Hope for tomorrow (hope!) 
 Hope in the time of sorrow (hope!) 
 He gives me hope (hope!) 
 He gives me hope (hope!) 
 Anybody want hope out there (hope!) 
 You better call on his name like you need him (hope!) 
 Oh hope (hope!) 
 Can I talk about him (yeah!) 
 Can I give him praise (yeah!) 
 Can I give him glory (yeah!) 
 Can you say yes (yeah!)

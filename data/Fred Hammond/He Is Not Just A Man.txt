The greatest gift to man from the Father 
 Would change us all in ways we've never seen 
 Yet his first moments were in a manger 
 And soon every living thing would call him King, yes they would 
 Though we didn't know it then we would soon understand 
 That his life would reveal God's perfect plan 
 He is not just a man (He is God) 
 He is not just a baby (He is King) 
 No He is not just the lamb 
 But the Lion of Judah, Savior and Ruler of all 
 We've tried our very best to perceive him 
 Sometimes I think it was beyond our reach 
 Well I guess that's why He asked us to receive him 
 With a chidlike heart only believe 
 And I hear him ask again 
 Who do men say that I am 
 And I feel the need to make the whole world see 
 Vamp: 
 But the Lion of Judah, Savior and Ruler of all (Repeat 3x) 
 He is not just a man

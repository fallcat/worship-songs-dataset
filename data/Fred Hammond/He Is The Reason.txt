Who is this King of Israel 
 Born in a manger 
 His name is Jesus 
 His name is Jesus 
 He came to set us free 
 God's only Son is He 
 Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
 Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 God rest ye merry Gentlemen 
 Let nothing you dismay 
 Remember Christ our Savior 
 Was born on Christmas day 
 To save us all from Satan's pow'r 
 When we were gone astray 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
 Comfort and joy 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
 He is the reason for the celebration 
 Go tell ev'rybody in every nation 
 Join with the angels 
 And lift high His name 
 And clap your hands 
 Just clap your hands 
 Clap your hands 
 And let the whole world know 
 He's the King of glory 
 The King of glory 
 The King of glory 
 The King of glory 
 The King of glory 
 The King of glory 
 The King of glory 
 He's the Lord God strong and mighty 
 Said He is the Prince of Peace 
 Jehovah Jireh 
 The Lord God strong and mighty 
 The Lord God mighty in battle 
 The Lord God strong and mighty 
 The Lord God mighty in battle 
 Help me lift Jesus higher 
 Help me lift Jesus higher and higher 
 Help me lift Jesus higher

 Whoa 
 It's time to celebrate the Savior and His worth 
 Let's shout because we know, He lives and we are served 
 His love has set us free our enemies defeated 
 If it means you would be, come on and lift up your hands 
 Everybody lift your hands if you know that Jesus is worthy 
 Open up and give Him praise let's do it in a hurry 
 If you love Him let's glorify in the song and in the dance 
 To know the Savior lives come on and lift up your hands 
 To understand just why we praise, let me tell you how it all went down 
 The news spread so very fast, people came from miles around 
 This would be the day Christ would be crucified 
 He took His last breath, He hung His head and He died 
 They took my Savior down from off that rugged cross 
 They laid Him in a tomb it seemed all hope was truly lost 
 But the third day came along and brought the rhythm of life 
 The stone was rolled away, an Angel proudly proclaimed 
 (He lives, He lives) 
 He lives 
 Christ is risen 
 (Christ is risen just like He said) 
 Our Lord and Savior 
 (The Lord and Savior is no longer dead) 
 Rejoice and celebrate He lives He lives Jesus is alive 
 Everybody lift your hands if you know that Jesus is worthy 
 Open up and give Him praise let's do it in a hurry 
 If you love Him let's glorify in the song and in the dance 
 To know the Savior lives come on and lift up your hands 
 Everybody lift your hands if you know that Jesus is worthy 
 Open up and give Him praise let's do it in a hurry 
 If you love Him let's glorify in the song and in the dance 
 We know the Savior lives come on and lift up your hands 
 (He lives, He lives) 
 He lives, He lives 
 Christ is risen just like He said 
 (Christ is risen just like He said) 
 Our Lord and Savior 
 (The Lord and Savior is no longer dead) 
 Rejoice and celebrate He lives He lives Jesus is alive

Dance with me if you want to 
 Dance with me if you want to 
 Praise with me if you want to 
 Come and sing with me if you want to 
 Won't you sing with me if you want to 
 Everybody, saying, my faith, my faith 
 My faith will carry me, yes, it will 
 Right to my destiny, I know it will 
 I am sure and there's no doubt in my mind 
 He'll do it, He'll do it 
 Yes, there are days my tribulations 
 Are hard to take 
 Causing bitter salty tears to run down my face 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over again 
 I encourage myself to press on to the end 
 There's an appointed destination I gotta make 
 Can you sing with, having Your word 
 Having Your word with me 
 My mind to guard, my heart to lead 
 I've decided, I'm pressing on come what may 
 Yes, I'm determined 
 My faith will carry me, yes, it will 
 Right to my destiny, I know it will 
 I am sure and there's no doubt in my mind 
 He'll do it, He'll do it 
 Yes, there are days with flying colors 
 I cruise on my way 
 Then there are other days I've fallen flat 
 Upon my face, can you say with me 
 No matter what tests come my way 
 I've determined my heart to give You perfect praise 
 Then I can stand up and refocus and walk on by faith 
 Lord You have proven that Your loving hand 
 Lord You have proven that 
 Your loving hand is on me so 
 I've decided I'm pressing on, come what may 
 Yes, I'm determined 
 My faith will carry me, yes, it will 
 Right to my destiny, I know it will 
 I am sure and there's no doubt in my mind 
 He'll do it, He'll do it 
 His love has set me free, yes, I'm free 
 Therefore I'm free indeed, I'm free indeed 
 I am sure and there's no doubt in my mind 
 He's done it, He's done it 
 I am persuaded my strength lies within You 
 In that oh, Lord, my victory's sure 
 Nothing can change my mind 
 No one can stop me now, no way, no how 
 I'm pressing on, I won't turn back 
 Provision's made, there is no lack 
 I'm standing on His promise 
 For He said He'd see me through it 
 And I know He'll do it 
 Through sunshine and rain, said He'd be there 
 Through heartbreak and pain, said He'd be there 
 I'm standing on His promise 
 For He said He's see me through it 
 And I know He'll do it 
 I know that there's so much more for me 
 My heart is ready, ready to receive 
 I'm standing on His promise 
 For He said He'd see me through it 
 And I know He'll do it 
 My faith will carry me, yes, it will 
 Right to my destiny, I know it will 
 I am sure and there's 
 For He said He'd see me through it 
 And I know He'll do it 
 My faith will carry me, yes, it will 
 Right to my destiny, I know it will 
 I am sure and there's 
 For He said He'd see me through it 
 And I know He'll do it 
 I know that there's so much more for me 
 My heart is ready, ready to receive 
 I'm standing on His promise 
 For He said He'd see me through it 
 And I know He'll do it

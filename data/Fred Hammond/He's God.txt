Our God is high and lifted up 
 And you should know 
 That's just the way it is 
 That's just the way it is 
 He is ruler of the Heavens and Earth below 
 That's just the way it is 
 That's just the way it is 
 He's in control of my life 
 He's sovereign, He knows what's right 
 He will take care of His own 
 He's God and He's on the throne 
 Ruling Earth and sky 
 And everything therein 
 He is crowned Most High 
 His kingdom never ends 
 I remind myself every now and then 
 He's God 
 That's just the way it is 
 Although our enemy is strong 
 God is stronger 
 That's just the way it is 
 That's just the way it is 
 And when He tells them that's enough 
 They go no longer 
 That's just the way it is 
 That's just the way it is 
 Ruling Earth and sky 
 And everything therein 
 He is crowned Most High 
 His kingdom never ends 
 I remind myself every now and then 
 He's God 
 That's just the way it is 
 He's in control of my life 
 He's sovereign, He knows what's right 
 He will take care of His own 
 He's God and He's on the throne 
 He's God 
 He's God 
 He's God 
 That's just the way it is

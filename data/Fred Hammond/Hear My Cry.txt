Hear my cry Oh Lord 
 Attend unto my earnest prayers 
 From the ends of the earth floor 
 Hear my cry unto thee 
 When my enemies encamped about me 
 They stumbled and fell 
 Within in my heart 
 I will cry out 
 To the Lord for help 
 Hear my cry 
 Hear my cry Oh Lord 
 Attend unto my earnest prayers 
 Rescue me Lord Jesus 
 And take away my every fear 
 (Heavenly Father, Heavenly Father, 
 I lift my hands to you) 
 In darkest hours 
 Of affliction 
 My faith will not be moved 
 When the storms rage 
 And the winds blow 
 Beneath your wings 
 I will hide 
 In the shadow 
 Of the Almighty 
 My soul will surely abide 
 Hear my cry 
 Hear my cry Oh Lord 
 Attend unto my earnest prayers 
 Rescue me Lord Jesus 
 And take away my every fear 
 Hear my cry Oh Lord 
 Give ear unto my earnest prayer 
 Strengthen me 
 King Jesus 
 Holy Spirit draw me near 
 Ad Libs 
 Rescue me Lord 
 Uphold me 
 Vindicate me 
 Rescue me and strengthen me Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy Spirit 
 Don't leave me 
 Renew me 
 Remember me 
 Reassemble me Lord 
 My heart is in my hands 
 And I give it you 
 Help me Lord (3x) 
 I cry for our children Lord 
 I cry for our families Lord 
 And our nations 
 And our cities 
 And our leaders 
 On their behalf 
 We cry unto 
 Hear my cry 
 Oh Lord 
 Down on our knees 
 Begging you please (2x) 
 Rescue us 
 Lord Jesus, take away our every fear 
 Our Pastors Lord (2x) 
 We pray for our shepards right now 
 We're down on our knees 
 Begging you please (2X) 
 Lord hear our prayer

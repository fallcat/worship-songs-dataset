I was in the spirit and in heaven saw a throne 
 And he that sat was to look upon as Jasper inside and stone 
 And before the throne the sea of past a creature never seen 
 And the four and twenty yield and sat and oh 's the blood, lay clean 
 And out of the throne preceded voices thundering and light hey 
 And the creatures that surrounded Him they rest not day or night 
 Crying... 
 Ho-ly Ho-ly, the four and twenty all fell down casting down their golden crowns 
 Crying 
 Ho-ly, Ho-ly, Worthy the almighty one which was and is and is to come forever and forever you are 
 Ho-ly, Ho-ly, the four and twenty all fell down casting down their golden crowns 
 Ho-ly, Ho-ly, Worthy the almighty one which was and is and is to come forever and forever you are Lord 
 Forever and forever you are Lord, 
 Forever and forever and forever and forever and 
 Forever and forever you are Lord 
 Forever and forever and forever and forever and forever and forever you are Lord 
 Alpha and Omega 
 Forever and forever and forever and forever and forever and forever you are Lord 
 Forever, Forever...

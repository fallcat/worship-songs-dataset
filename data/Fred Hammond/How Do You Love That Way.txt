I must have made You cry a million tears 
 Used enough mercy for a million years 
 You'd think by now Your grace would disappear 
 Guess that's why You called it love 
 You spread Your arms across eternity 
 You shed Your blood to buy my liberty 
 You fight for me with all intensity 
 With an undeniable love 
 How do You love that way 
 I need You to teach me to love that way 
 Why do You love that way 
 Whatever You do don't stop 
 Addicted to my selfishness and greed 
 Thinking my foolishness could meet my need 
 Pulled up flowers tryin' to make room for weeds 
 But it doesn't uproot Your love, I'm so crazy 
 You just correct me-try to slow me down 
 Rain on me softly when my leaves are brown 
 Resuscitate me when I hit the ground 
 So tenacious with Your love 
 I wandered and wavered a ship lost at sea 
 I treated Your mercy so frivolously 
 Yet an ocean of love You poured over me 
 Your love won't stop 
 (Pre-Vamp) 
 How do You love oh Lord 
 Will You teach me to love that way 
 Why do You love 
 Whatever You do don't stop 
 (Vamp) 
 By holding me, oh Lord 
 You're showing me 
 By teaching me, oh Lord I plainly see 
 Your love indeed, it amazes me 
 Whatever You do don't stop 
 Why You would smile upon this broken man 
 It blows my mind I just don't understand 
 For the love I need is in Your nail-scarred hand 
 Whatever You do don't stop 
 (Repeat Vamp-Out)

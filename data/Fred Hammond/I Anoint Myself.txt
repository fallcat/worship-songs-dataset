One, two, three 
 I started out a long, long, long time ago 
 But my journey held most things I did not know 
 But I was sure and believed the plan You gave 
 Was so secure inside of me 
 In latter days I found failure down 
 And complacency came to pull me down 
 They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone 
 Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure 
 Now when I need strength to endure 
 There's one thing that I can count on 
 To help me make it through 
 I anoint myself 
 I anoint myself, bring my mind back 
 And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again 
 Keep the love, that I gotta do 
 'Cause I'm here to serve You 
 My heart it says, it's not too late 
 Before I waste another day 
 Kneel and pray 
 This is how I remind myself 
 Now my savior's gone, it seems like I have it down 
 I've stood through it all, it feels still to rise and come around 
 Trying to guarantee this day I'm going forward 
 And the battle starts all over again 
 Now when I need to know for sure 
 There's one thing that I can count on 
 To help me make it through 
 I anoint myself 
 I anoint myself, bring my mind back 
 And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again 
 Keep in my heart what I gotta do 
 'Cause I'm here to serve You 
 My heart it says, it's not too late 
 Before I waste another day 
 Kneel and pray 
 This is how I remind myself 
 Sometimes in this world, challenges come 
 And emotions get carried away 
 But in faith be strong and to His word hold on 
 And when if doubt comes, guard up yourself 
 Stand there and say I remember 
 Sometimes gotta remind myself 
 What I've been called to do 
 Is first to be with you 
 Sometimes I gotta remember, oh yeah 
 That you called me, Lord 
 Yes, you did and I'm at your disposal 
 Sometimes gotta remind myself 
 What I've been called to do 
 Is first to be with you 
 Sometimes, gotta remind myself 
 That you called me, called me 
 And I'm at your disposal 
 I anoint myself, bring my mind back 
 And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again 
 Keep in my heart what I gotta do 
 'Cause I'm here to serve You 
 My heart it says, it's not too late 
 Before I waste another day 
 Kneel and pray 
 This is how I remind myself 
 Sometimes gotta remind myself 
 Sometimes gotta remind myself 
 Sometimes gotta remind myself 
 That you called me, called me 
 And I'm at your disposal

Now it's time to ease your mind so hear me as I say 
 Life's not always down you see, ay 
 If the sun refuse to shine and all your skies are gray 
 Just sing this simple melody, yeah 
 And I feel good and I know it don't hate me if I show it 
 The joy I feel on the inside will show up on the outside 
 My hands go up and I praise Him 
 You know I'm gonna thank Him 
 The happiness in my life, today it won't be denied 
 And I feel good, good, good 
 Now I realize there will be days we will feel down and blue 
 But that's not gon' be today, ay 
 If you take the time to pray for me, I'll pray for you 
 And we lift our voice and say 
 And I feel good and I know it, don't hate me if I show it 
 The joy I feel on the inside will show up on the outside 
 My hands go up and I praise Him, you know I'm gonna thank Him 
 The happiness in my life, today it won't be denied 
 I choose to feel love, I choose to feel peace, a peace of mind 
 I know that these things are promised to me 
 I will wear a smile and that's just how it will be 
 'Cause I'm with the Son and He set me free 
 Come on sing it, I feel good, you know that I feel good 
 Come on and if you don't mind 
 Come on, join with me, it will be fine 
 Come on and my hands go up and I praise Him 
 I feel like praising him, come and say 
 Come on and if you don't mind, come on, have a good time 
 And I feel good, you know that I feel good 
 Come on and if you don't mind, join with me

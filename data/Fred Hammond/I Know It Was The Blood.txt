Everybody listen, just in case you didn't know, 
 Here is the main ingredient, 
 It really changed my life. 
 A life full of iniquity and very deeply stained, 
 But I found my hope at Calvary, 
 Flowing from my Savior's veins. 
 You ask me if I think it worked, 
 I'll tell you I don't think, 'cause I know... 
 (I know, I know, I know). 
 Life saving, life changing, 
 It covers me and I tell you I know... 
 I know it was the blood, 
 I know it was the blood. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 I know it was the blood. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 I know it was the blood. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 I know it was the blood. 
 What's able to reach the highest mountain, 
 What's strong enough to reach the valley low? 
 (Tell me what brings our salvation and defeats our foes), 
 What has the awesome power to cleanse and make us whole? 
 You ask me if I think it worked, 
 I'll tell you I don't think, 'cause I know ... 
 (I know, I know, I know). 
 What washed me, what saved me, 
 What changed me, I tell you I know... 
 What was it that sprang out like a fountain 
 When they pierced His side? 
 What was it that snatched me from the grave, 
 When they nailed His feet? 
 What was it that flowed down from Calvary's mountain 
 From His nailed scarred hand, 
 So everyone who was lost on earth 
 Could now be saved, I know... 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me. 
 The blood came streamin', 
 The blood came streamin' down, 
 I know, I know, I know. 
 (And if you're not ashamed), 
 (Then let the people say...) 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me. 
 I know it was the blood, 
 Was the blood, just for me.

Since you hooked up with the Savior 
 And laid your life down, 
 Didn't let nothin' fade you, 
 'Cause you were heaven bound. 
 The gentle rains in your life 
 Just got an upgrade to a hurricane. 
 In the hands of the Master, 
 It seems like you gotta fight and scratch just to remain. 
 You're gonna make it to the end, 
 Believe it, (until then...) 
 I press (say that you're gonna press, my friend), 
 Still I press (You're gonna hang on in there till the end). 
 I press (You know the King of glory is with you), 
 Still I press (go in His name and He'll see ya through). 
 I press. 
 My road is not always easy, 
 Nobody said it would be, 
 And if you use the word perfect, 
 I know you're not referring to me. 
 But here's what I do, 
 Forget the junk behind me, 
 I set my sights on His high calling. 
 And by faith, I'll apprehend, 
 (Until then...) 
 Vamp 1: 
 Till I become what He wants me to be, yeah, 
 I press. 
 This is the goal and the prize that I reach for, 
 I press. 
 Vamp 2: 
 Till I become what He wants me to be, yeah, 
 (Repeat as desired) 
 I press. 
 Vamp 3: 
 This is the goal and the prize that I reach for, 
 (Repeat as desired) 
 I press. 
 Vamp 4: 
 I press.

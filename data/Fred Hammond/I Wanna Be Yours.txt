Before the world was made you knew me. 
 Before I Knew my name, you called. 
 Reaching out for you with loving arms, telling me that I am yours. 
 Sometimes turning away from you. 
 But, your love still remains faithful and true. 
 What can I give in return for all you've done for me? 
 Before I was born, you knew me. 
 Called me to your arms of love. 
 Born into sin deserving death, but life is what you gave to me. 
 Sometimes turning my back from you. 
 But, your love still remains faithful and true. 
 What can I give in return for all you've done for me? 
 Oh Lord you made me and you knew me. 
 Fron the beginning you held my heart you held me close so I won't resist you 
 But as you intended, I wanna be yours 
 Repeat bridge until end

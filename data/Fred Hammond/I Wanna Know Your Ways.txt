I wanna know your ways 
 By: Fred Hammond 
 Here I stand before you 
 Your glory is here 
 And it fills this place 
 And I am willing to 
 Do what I must just to know your ways 
 (Channel) 
 Everything I've attained 
 And all I know, I'd give it away 
 Just to know you, Lord 
 Would fulfill my whole life 
 So I'm glad to say 
 I wanna know Your ways 
 So I can please You each and every day 
 If I've found favor in Your sight 
 Teach me Your ways, Your ways 
 I boast, not in myself 
 Or the things I've learned 
 Lord You know it's true 
 But I seek after one thing 
 To know Your ways 
 Then I will know You

 I wanna know Ya better 
 Better than I did the day, You know, when I met Ya 
 I never wanna let Ya, catch me sleeping on the job 
 I don't care who thinks it's odd because they ain't my God 
 But to know Ya (know Ya) 
 Is more than to love Ya (love Ya) 
 Because You're real Ya I can feel Ya 
 Everything I've learned and all my skills 
 I count them dung 
 Yes I will

 In Your power

 As You sufferd 
 In Your power

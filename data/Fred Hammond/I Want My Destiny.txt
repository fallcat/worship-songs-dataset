Born to give my very best 
 To the One whose willingness 
 To give His life He just said yes 
 And here's the reason 
 He saw me out there all alone 
 So for my sin He did atone 
 He purchased me I'm not my own 
 I wanna please Him 
 (Channel A) 
 So now I serve Him 
 Who brought me and is able to keep me all together 
 In the presence of His glory I found 
 That for my life His good and perfect purpose was designed 
 To bring me to the place where He has need of me 
 So I want my destiny, yeah 
 Can't settle for half or nothing short 
 Of what you made me to be or want me to be 
 'Cause I want it all 
 As I look around 
 The time is now 
 My mind is telling me 
 Gotta be gotta be destiny 
 Not called to sit upon the shelf 
 He did not die just for His health 
 And with the time we have 
 Let's waste not all on selfish reasons 
 But we must seek to please Him first 
 Find His will upon the Earth 
 When they look back from death to birth 
 They'll say they've seen Him 
 (Repeat Channel in this manner) 
 Now we must serve Him 
 Who brought us and is able to keep us all together 
 In the presence of His glory we've found 
 That for our lives His good and perfect purpose was designed 
 To bring us to the place where He needs us to be 
 Do you want your destiny, come on say 
 Hold on don't let go 
 To give up now would be jacked up for sure 
 The journey is long and hard is the fight 
 But we trust in the Lord in the power of His might 
 There's power in His word 
 And He's gonna see us through 
 So keepin' the faith is what we've gotta do 
 To believe our God is more than able, able 
 Fight the good fight as we press towards the mark we push in 
 That we obtain His favor 
 So we will know and have true confidence that, the prize 
 Of His call is much greater 
 Say I really want my destiny come on say 
 I want it

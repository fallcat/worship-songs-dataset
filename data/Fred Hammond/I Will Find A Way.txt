I've lost some joy/ I've lost sometime/Now it feels like I will lose my mind 
 Journeyed long and lost my way/And now it feels like I've lost is all I say 
 Channel 1 
 Searching here and over there for what I've lost/ Where is it, I don't know 
 I will find a way 
 I will find a way to lift up my hands (lift up my hands)/ And I will find a way 
 To worship You Lord (Find a way, I will find a way)/ And though my heart is low 
 I'll find a way to give You praise/ I'll find a way to love You more 
 I've lost so much/ down through the years/It seems that all I find here lately 
 Is a face so full of tears/ I search each dark/ and empty space 
 The peace I used to know/ Somehow I have misplaced 
 Channel 2 
 Searching here and over there for what I've lost/ I don't have them anymore 
 I will find a way to lift up my hands (lift up my hands)/ And I will find a way 
 To worship You Lord (Find a way, I will find a way)/ And though my heart is low 
 I'll find a way to give You praise/ I'll find a way to love You more 
 One thing I've not lost is will to move ahead/ and I've kept a faith that 
 Trust in You Lord/ And I find way down within myself a love for You Lord 
 That overflows/ But I know I can love You more/ With every loss and though it all 
 I will find a way to lift up my hands (lift up my hands)/ And I will find a way 
 To worship You Lord (Find a way, I will find a way) 
 And though my life is broken I'll find a way to give You praise 
 I'll find a way to love You more

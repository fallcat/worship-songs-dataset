The hills are steep and rough is the road 
 Nothing to fear as long as I know 
 I'm not alone, Lord, You're here with me 
 I'm in Your care yes this I believe 
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
 To encourage my soul 
 I will say 
 In Him will I trust 
 And I will say 
 You're God and You will never change 
 And I will say 
 You're more than enough 
 (Channel 1) 
 To hurt or to heal 
 To break or to mend 
 Power is all inside 
 And since You gave the power to me, yeah 
 That's what I'll say, yeah 
 And when my walls come tumbling down 
 Shadows of death just hanging around 
 I will not fear 'cause You're here with me, yeah 
 I'm in Your care yes this I believe 
 (Channel 2) 
 To fall or to fly 
 To stand or to hide 
 You know the choice is mine 
 So by the power given to me 
 I'm gonna say 
 My fountain of joy 
 My river of life 
 My maker and my redeemer 
 My rest and my peace 
 My rock and my truth 
 And all of these things I will say 
 (Chorus B) 
 To encourage my soul 
 And I will say 
 In You will I trust 
 I will say 
 You're God and You will never change 
 And I will say 
 You're more than enough 
 (Vamp) 
 I will say, I will say, I will say 
 Speak life into my soul 
 I'll speak life 
 (Repeat-Out)

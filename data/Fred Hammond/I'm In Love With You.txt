What in the world is this feeling that's come over me? 
 Like the wind from a warm summer's breeze. 
 If I'm sleep don't wake me from this dream. 
 There's only one thing that I know that it can be. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 Out for so long I was sad 'cause I felt so alone. 
 Now you're here and the lonely is gone. 
 Now the Lord has completed my song. 
 He's answered my prayer, now my searching is through. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 There was a time that I thought this couldn't be. 
 But the Lord saw fit to smile on me. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 I'm in love with you and you love with me too. 
 I wanna thank you, Heavenly Father, for shining your light on me. 
 So glad you're mine. So glad you're mine. So glad you're mine. 
 I'm in love with you.

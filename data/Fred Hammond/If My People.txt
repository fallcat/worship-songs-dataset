If My people which are called by my name 
 Shall humble themselves and pray 
 And seek My face and turn from their 
 Wicked ways, hey 
 Then will I hear from Heaven 
 Then will I forgive sin 
 And heal their land (hey) 
 Now My eyes are opened 
 Now My ears are attentive to their prayers 
 Then will I hear from Heaven 
 And forgive their sins 
 And heal their land 
 And forgive their sins 
 And heal their land 
 (Repeat) 
 Trust me now and I will 
 Oh, oh heal the land

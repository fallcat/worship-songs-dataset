Oh, Lord when I think of You 
 So faithful, loving and true 
 Not another love comes even close 
 I wanna share You with all of the world 
 With a name I really love to call 
 For no real reason at all 
 Just the mention brings the victory 
 Gets all in my hands and all in my feet 
 Everyday it just gets sweeter 
 And I love You more 
 How could I make it, I couldn't take it 
 I holding on and won't let go 
 Now this feeling I can't describe 
 For the healing You brought in my life, yeah 
 You're still the mender of broken hearts 
 Hearing the cry of the one in the dark 
 To the one that wants to know the truth, ooh yeah 
 Here's what I wanna say to you 
 Try Him for yourself and you will see 
 Why I say everyday just gets sweet 
 (Repeat Chorus 2x's) 
 (Dance) 
 Take two steps to the back 
 And two steps to the front 
 Now to the left 
 And to the right 
 Get your praise on 
 (Repeat Dance 1x) 
 (Vamp) 
 Better 
 Sweeter 
 Mention of Your name 
 Joy replaces pain 
 And with my whole heart I'll love You always 
 Better 
 Each day with You is much sweeter 
 Mention of Your name 
 Joy replaces pain 
 And with my whole heart I'll love You always 
 (Repeat Vamp-Out)

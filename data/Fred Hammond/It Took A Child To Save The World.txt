All the angels held their breath 
 As Heaven put on human clothes 
 Rang the news God did not forget 
 His promise that was sent from the prophets old 
 The answer came in a sacred birth 
 Truth and justice, meek and mild 
 All the hope and the peace on earth 
 Rested in the hands of a newborn child 
 From God in the highest 
 Heaven made a way in a manger 
 From God in the highest 
 Love was born through a simple virgin girl 
 Took a child to save the world 
 For the ones who were lost He came 
 Every child of Adam's fall 
 Emmanuel was the precious name 
 Of the small boy who would grow 
 And would touch us all 
 From God in the highest 
 Heaven made a way in a manger 
 From God in the highest 
 Love was born through a simple virgin girl 
 A child to save the world 
 From God in the highest 
 Heaven made a way in a manger 
 From God in the highest 
 Love was born through a simple virgin girl 
 Took a child to save the world 
 So let the kings and the nations bow 
 To the baby so divine 
 As we lift up our voices now 
 Praises to the Savior of all mankind 
 From God in the highest 
 Heaven made a way in a manger 
 From God in the highest 
 Love was born through a simple virgin girl 
 Took a child to save the world 
 From God in the highest 
 Heaven made a way in a manger 
 From God in the highest 
 Love was born through a simple virgin girl 
 Took a child to save the world 
 For God so loved the world 
 That He gave His only Son 
 Took a child to save the world 
 For God so loved the world 
 That He gave His only Son 
 He came to seek the lost like you and I 
 He came to seek and save 
 Redeem us back to Him 
 For God so loved the world 
 For God so loved the world 
 That He gave His only Son 
 If you will believe in Him you will have 
 If you will believe in Him eternal life you'll find

Jesus be a fence all around me everyday 
 Jesus I want you to protect me as I travel along the way 
 I know you can (yes Lord) 
 I know you will (yes Lord) 
 Fight my battle (yes Lord) 
 If I just keep still (yes lord) 
 Lord be a fence all around me everyday 
 This is my prayer Lord that I pray each and every day 
 That you would guide my footsteps lest I stumble and stray 
 Lord, I need you to direct me all along the way 
 Oh Lord be a fence all around me everyday 
 Come on help me say, Jesus... 
 Sometimes the way get so rough y'all 
 And the nights are so long 
 In my hour of weakness, that old enemy tries to steal my soul 
 But when he comes like a flood to surround me 
 My God will step in and a standard he'll raise 
 Oh Lord be a fence all around me everyday 
 Oh Jesus

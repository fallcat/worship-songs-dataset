Jesus is all the world 
 The world to me 
 He is my life 
 He's everything that I've hoped for 
 He's everything that I need 
 When I am lonely 
 He gives me comfort 
 When I'm sad he cheers me 
 I wanna let you know 
 If I should fall 
 He lifts me up 
 And When I am empty 
 He fills my cup, yeah 
 I was thinkin' 'bout the time when I 
 I didn't have a dime 
 I thought if I could just get paid 
 I would be just fine 
 But the money let me down yes it did 
 It couldn't even buy me love 
 So I gave Jesus, control of my life 
 And I'm really satisfyed 
 Now I wanna let you know 
 I don't get excited 
 About much, but I tell you this 
 If you wanna know the deal 
 I'm tellin' you Jesus is real 
 He woke me up this morning 
 And started me on my way 
 That's a real nice thing 
 Without Jesus, say 
 I couldn't face the day 
 Without the lord in my life 
 I really don't wanna say 
 But I will say this 
 Without the savior in my life 
 All I would do is fail 
 I would be tossed and driven 
 Like a ship in a storm 
 Without a sail 
 So I wanna let you know 
 I've been alot of places 
 And I've seen alot of things 
 But I want to let you know one thing, hey 
 Vamp 
 Jesus is all 
 Jesus is all the world to me 
 Jesus is all 
 Absolutley everything 
 When I was a wretch undone 
 He looked beyond my faults 
 And that's a real nice thing 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Jesus is all 
 Jesus is all the world to me 
 Jesus is all 
 Absolutley everything 
 Although he strechted his arms and died 
 He rose again with all power 
 That's a real nice thing

How wonderful it is to know that Jesus is 
 All that I need to make my life complete 
 And He's so much more, Yeah 
 He reached for me when all else 
 Went away 
 He wouldn't leave, through the tough 
 Times He stayed 
 He's stood by me till his love I could see 
 And now I'm secure 
 And in His power nothing's gonna 
 Conquer me 
 I just believe what He says I will be 
 I won't be stopped as long as I am in 
 His hands 
 And when all else fails me on Him 
 I can stand 
 'Cause He's a bridge 
 He's a bridge so let him take you over 
 He's a rock that's higher, higher than I 
 He's a way when there is no other 
 Jesus is, He's a bridge 
 Jehovah Shalom, He is my peace 
 Jehovah-Rophe the God that healeth me 
 He's El-Shaddai and He's more than 
 Enough of everything I need 
 It's by His Grace that He's made me His 
 'Cause everything that I'm not, Jesus is 
 With new compassions everyday in my soul 
 He does feed 
 And in His power nothing's gonna 
 Conquer me 
 I just believe what He says I will be 
 I won't be stopped as long as I am in 
 His hands 
 And when all else fails me on Him I 
 Can stand 
 'Cause He's a bridge 
 He's a bridge so let him take you over 
 He's a rock that's higher, higher than I 
 He's a way when there is no other 
 Jesus is, He's a bridge

Stockings and presents under the tree 
 Old Christmas carols being sung on the streets 
 Lights fill the air, loves everywhere 
 (Christmas always brings us cheer) 
 Family you've not seen since last year 
 Drives several miles so they can be near 
 Dinners prepared, gifts often shared 
 (This is the best time of year) 
 These are the times we should hold dear 
 Hearts filled with joy, flowing with cheer 
 Songs filled with praise this holiday 
 Rocking this holiday with thoughts of peace 
 For friends and loved ones 
 All of these things courtesy of Christ 
 The newborn king 
 Now when we give gifts to loved ones 
 It should remind us of God's gift to us 
 Jesus the king sent from the father above 
 So on every Christmas day remember the reason 
 Why we celebrate 
 Lift up your voice, make a joyful noise 
 Give thanks for we have been reading 
 These are the times we should hold dear 
 Hearts filled with joy, flowing with cheer 
 Songs filled with praise this holiday 
 Rocking this Christmas holiday 
 Stockings with presents under the tree 
 These are a few of my favorite things 
 I remember 
 Keeping in mind what the Father gave you and me 
 God gave His Son He is Christ the King 
 Just remember 
 Old Christmas carols being sung on the streets 
 These are a few of my favorite things 
 (Silent night, holy night, holding bright, 
 Good will, peace on earth) 
 Salvation we can find 
 God gave His son 
 He is Christ the King 
 Just remember, just remember, 
 Just remember, remember, remember

Oh, yeah 
 I will bless You Lord because You've been so good 
 You have been my strength in the time of weakness 
 There 
 s never been a time I couldn't count on You 
 So I will bless You, oh, Lord, in the midst of the people 
 Come on somebody, right here, right now 
 We come to give Your name the glory 
 Somebody help me 
 Sisters tell me something, come on 
 Looked around the week was gone 
 Worked my fingers to the bone, I should've known 
 That the struggle I had faced wasn't over 
 Drama won't leave me alone 
 When the world all around me gives me every reason to faint 
 My first and the last real defense is to stand and say 
 No matter what is going on 
 My God still sits upon the throne 
 I might get down but not for long 
 My praise will keep me moving on 
 Join in together like this, like this come 
 Sister tell me something else 
 Turned around I'd made it through 
 Wasn't sure of how I would surely fade but You'd cover 
 And my joy you would renew 
 You know the enemy seeks and he roars with his plans to abuse 
 In the midst of his rage and his lies let us stand on the truth 
 No matter what is going on 
 My God still sits upon the throne 
 I might get down but not for long 
 My praise will keep me moving on 
 No matter what the circumstance 
 I know my life is n his hands 
 The storms may come but not for long 
 My praise will keep me moving on 
 Now if I'm really honest I really gotta say 
 That I get somewhat discouraged when trials come my way 
 But this will be my choice, will be my choice 
 No matter what the day may bring to you 
 Keep praising God 
 Whether up or down, whether good or bad 
 Keep your praise always 
 No matter what the day may bring to you 
 Keep praising God 
 Whether this or that just don't hold back 
 Keep your praise flowing 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 No matter what the day may bring to you 
 Keep praising God 
 Whether up or down, whether good or bad 
 Keep your praise always 
 No matter what the day may bring to you 
 Keep praising God 
 Whether this or that just don't hold back 
 Keep your praise flowing 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep on, keep praisin' 
 Keep your praise always 
 Somebody put your hands together 
 When it seems like your world is going crazy 
 This is what you do 
 Get your praise, keep your praise, keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep your praise always 
 Put your hands let me hear the horns play 
 When the world all around you is sinking sand 
 Somebody lift your hands and say 
 I'm gonna praise Him anyway 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep on praisin' 
 Keep your praise always

Such a sweet communion 
 As everyday I seek Your face 
 Knowing that Your best for me is wherever You are 
 You can speak life in me 
 And take me up on eagle's wings 
 And all day long I think on these things 
 Lord they that keep their minds stayed on You 
 Will be kept in perfect peace 
 Ad I know You are able to 
 Cause my fears to cease 
 Won't let a day go by 
 Without keeping my mind 
 Keeping it stayed on Jesus 
 Stayed on Jesus 
 With every new sunrise 
 I gotta keep my mind 
 Meditate on Him 
 And keep His Spirit deep within 
 When the darkness covers me 
 When the light grows strangely dim 
 It's Your power that anchors me 
 For I keep Your words deep within 
 So what the day holds for me won't make me run and hide 
 As long as You are my guide 
 For they that keep their minds stayed on You 
 Will be kept in perfect peace 
 I know You are able to 
 Cause my fears to cease 
 Oh what joy You've given me 
 As I learn to trust in You 
 You have bee proven to be all that I need 
 All that I need, So I say 
 (Vamp) 
 Stay, Stay, Keeping my mind on Jesus 
 Stay, stay 
 Meditate on Him and keep His Spirit deep within 
 (Repeat)

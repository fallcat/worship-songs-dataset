Destiny just a few more steps just a little 
 But an irate enemy is in the middle 
 And swearin' (sayin') there's no way I will complete it 
 But I ain't playin' 'cause I know he is defeated so 
 (Channel A) 
 Before fear takes its part 
 I've branded Your Word in my heart 
 So whenever I feel dismayed 
 I say to myself 
 (Let me praise You now) 
 Lord I praise Your name because You are who You are-(Let me praise You now) 
 I lift You higher every night and day-(Let me praise You now) 
 Lord Your Word is so true and we know this by far 
 So we're taking this time to give You all the praise 
 (Let me praise You now) 
 (Let me praise You) 
 Rejoice make sure the Lord is praised in the battle 
 Get back up if you get knocked off the saddle 
 Heartbreak may come in your life just to be a distraction 
 But let's trust in the name of the Lord 
 (Channel B) 
 For His counsel is sure 
 His joy will help us to endure 
 Each and every trial and pain 
 So before fear takes its part 
 Let's hide the Word deep in our heart 
 And if ever we feel dismayed just remind yourself 
 (Vamp A) 
 (Let me praise You now) 
 Lord we praise Your name because You are who You are-(Let me praise You now) 
 We lift Your name above the heavens high-(Let me praise You now) 
 Lord we glorify You and we know this by far 
 There's no way we could hide from Your all-seeing eye 
 (Vamp B) 
 Lord we praise Your name because You are who You are-(Let me praise You now) 
 We lift Your name above the heavens high-(Let me praise You now) 
 Lord we glorify You and we know this by far 
 There's no way we could hide from Your all-seeing eye 
 (I) Cannot compare no one there's no one like You-(Nobody) 
 No one that we've seen in all our days-(Nobody) 
 No one else can do for us the things that You do 
 So we're taking this time to give You all the praise 
 Your name is Holy 
 Not to be taken light 
 Mountains tremble at the sight of You-(Come on) 
 Your works are perfect marvelous in our sight 
 When we think of all the power we are 
 Thinking of You 
 Let me praise You right now 
 Let me praise You now 
 Your works are perfect marvelous in our sight 
 So we're taking this time to give You all the praise 
 Your name is Holy

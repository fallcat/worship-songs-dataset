Here we are 
 Let's get on one accord 
 Leave all your problems on the outside 
 To be consumed with the Holy Ghost fire 
 Open up your mouth and lift the name of Jesus higher, say 
 Chorus A 
 Are you ready for your blessing? (are ya ready) 
 Are you ready for your miracle? 
 For the chains that come from the enemy 
 Are utterly destroyed when the praises ring, hey hey 
 Chorus B 
 Hallelujah, thank you Jesus (he's exalted forever so...) 
 Let the praise begin 
 Lord I love you 
 No one above you (just put yo hands together and let...) 
 Let the praise begin 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 I know it might be tough to get yo praise on 
 Trials of life been catching you all week long 
 If you don't have a reason to praise him let me give you one 
 He gave you a brand new mercy 
 With the rising of the sun, say 
 (Chorus A) 2 times 
 (Chorus B) 2 times 
 Chorus A 
 Are you ready for your blessing? 
 Are you ready for your miracle? 
 For the chains that bind up the enemy 
 Are at your disposal when the praises ring 
 (Chorus A) (again) 
 Vamp... 2 times 
 Raise up 
 Send the praise up 
 Raise up 
 Send the praise up 
 Raise up 
 Send the praise up 
 He's here right now 
 C'mon 
 It's in your praise (8x) 
 He's here (6x) 
 He's here right now

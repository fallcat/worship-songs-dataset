Life is not all that bad, my friend, hmmm 
 If you believe in yourself 
 If you believe there's Someone 
 Who walks through life without you 
 You'll never be alone 
 Just learn to reach out, 
 And open your heart 
 Lift up hands to God, 
 And He'll show you the way. 
 And He said, "Cast your burdens upon Me 
 Those who are heavily laden, 
 Come to Me, all of you who are tired 
 Of carrying heavy loads, 
 For the yoke I will give you is easy 
 And My burden is light, 
 Come to Me and I will give you rest." 
 When you feel the world 
 Is tumblin' down on you, 
 And you have no one 
 That you can hold on to, 
 Just face the rising sun 
 And you'll see hope, 
 And there's no need to run 
 Lift up your hands to God, 
 And He'll make you feel all right. 
 And He said, "Cast your burdens upon Me 
 Those who are heavily laden, 
 Come to Me, all of you who are tired 
 Of carrying heavy loads, 
 For the yoke I will give you is easy 
 And My burden is light, 
 Come to Me and I will give you rest."

You're Lord of the harvest 
 And we worship you, we worship you this day, 
 You're Lord of the harvest, and we worship you, 
 Let me hear the people of God say! 
 You're Lord of the harvest, 
 And we worship you, we worship you this day 
 You're Lord of the harvest, 
 And we worship you, we worship you this day 
 Eternal Lord, Remains the same, Age to Age 
 All our love, All our Praise, Night and Day 
 With this song, and our lives, now we prove 
 There's no one, to take your place, Lord you Rule 
 We worship You! 
 You are my daily, daily bread! 
 You are my living, living Word! 
 You are my present, present help! 
 You are, You are, You are! 
 You are, you are, you are, you are (Repeat)

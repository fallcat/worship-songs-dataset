She thought all she needed could be found in man 
 Building all her hopes and dreams on temporary things 
 She's laughing on the outside but she's crying on the inside she's 
 Hangin' in there on a wing and a prayer and I can hear her say... 
 Channel 1 
 I think I'm getting wiser now/ Cause things are gettin' clearer now 
 We're only on prayer away/ Don't watse another day 
 Lord we need Your love/ If wew're ever gonna make it/ no longer can we fake it 
 We need it right now, right now/ Lord we need Your love/ Every mornin' 
 Every evenin'/ In and out of every season/ Right now, right now 
 Verse 2 (Marvin L. Winans) 
 Oh he thought he didn't need nobody/ he said he couldn't trust nobody 
 He tried to be a strong man but he was hurtin' from a broken heart 
 All the money in the world/ could never buy him peace of mind 
 He's running on empty and he feels like he's runnin' out of time 
 Verse 3 (Brian McKnight) 
 Don't take love for granted/ you gotta embrace it right away 
 What you have some don't find, ever/ in the bottom line 
 So think it over you gotta/ square your shoulders and / before it's all done 
 You'll look around/ and I'm bound to hear you say

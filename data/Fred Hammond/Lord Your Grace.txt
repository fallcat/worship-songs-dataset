Lord Your grace 
 Covering me like a soft summer shower 
 Raining down on me 
 Goodness and mercy 
 Loving me daily 
 Forgiving me freely 
 Poor and afraid left out lost and alone 
 Till Your tender love came and made me your own 
 How could I make it and where would I be 
 Without Your grace, (undeserved favor) grace, grace 
 Where sin abounds grace abounds so much more 
 Covering me from the sun to the floor 
 And if I forget then the spirit of grace cries out 
 Peace 
 (And I remember) 
 Sweet peace

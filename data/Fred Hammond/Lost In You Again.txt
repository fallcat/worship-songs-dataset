Seems like I've spent this whole life of mine 
 Searching and searching trying to find 
 A life filled with love that You already gave 
 Because of the searching, it pulled me away 
 I Found all the heartache, I found all the pain 
 I Found all the drama, I found all the shame 
 But my search will not end, no my search will not end 
 Till I find myself 
 Lost in You again, lost in You again 
 My search will not end, till I find myself 
 You said seek and I'll find, ask and I'll find, knock and the door will be open Lord 
 Lost in You again, lost in You again 
 My search will not end, till I find myself 
 Lost in You 
 Lost in You 
 Lost in You 
 Lost in You

I love your name 
 And I love your touch 
 I love your voice 
 How heals my heart 
 Oh Lord Oh Lord, I'm so in love with you 
 I love your thoughts 
 And I love your ways 
 I love your word 
 Love to give you praise 
 Oh Lord Oh Lord, I'm so in love with you 
 Oh Lamb Oh Lamb 
 My sins held you to, to the cross 
 Oh Lamb Oh Lamb 
 Your love paid the price for us all 
 Oh Lamb Oh Lamb 
 Your love covers all, all my faults 
 Oh Lamb Oh Lamb 
 My heart longs for all that you are 
 With a heart of love 
 And a sincere praise 
 My true desire is you Oh Lord 
 With this song of worship 
 Hands up raised that say 
 We love you, We love you, We love you, We love you

Somewhere a man will cry out 
 For help to meet others needs 
 Inside his heart will break 
 'Cause his voice no one wants to heed 
 Somewhere a mother mourns her loss 
 She sits in a lonely tear 
 Due to the hatred of someone else 
 Her child is no longer here 
 (Chorus A) 
 'Cause love's in need 
 Of love today 
 Don't delay 
 Send Yours in right away 
 Hates goin' 'round 
 Breakin' many hearts 
 Stop and plead 
 Before it goes too far 
 Your tenderness can heal a heart 
 That's broken and scarred and torn apart 
 Somebody needs to feel how much 
 You really care 
 No longer can we pretend 
 We don't need love or a true friend 
 'Cause it wasn't meant to be this way 
 Yesterday's gone but we can get down on our knees today 
 (Repeat Chorus A 1x) 
 (Chorus B) 
 'Cause Love's in need (Love's in need) 
 Of love today (Love's in need) 
 Don't delay 
 Send Yours in right away 
 Hates goin' 'round (Love's in need) 
 Breakin' many hearts (Love's in need) 
 Stop and plead 
 Before it goes too far 
 (Vamp) 
 Love, love, love... That's what the world needs now 
 Love, love, love... Before it goes too far 
 Break it down a little 
 Love is very peaceful 
 So break it down a little bit 
 (Out)

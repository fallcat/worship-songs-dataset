Oh, umm, yeah 
 Loved on me, thank you Jesus 
 And I thank you Lord 
 "Baby Dub", "Coconut", can you help me out hey yeah... 
 I was at the crib y'all 
 A few days ago 
 Started reminiscing 
 Then the tears start to flow 
 Thinking 'bout Your grace and Your mercy 
 How they pulled me in 
 And I got happy 
 I said I got happy 
 (Channel) 
 You took me from the dust-You made me 
 All over through and through-You know me 
 Not willing for me to die {Reached down and saved me with Your precious...} 
 Love from heaven {When I was bound it} Set me free 
 Now I'm thankful that You 
 Loved on me 
 It doesn't really matter 
 If you're young or old 
 And it's really not a factor 
 If you're rich or poor 
 There ain't no limit 
 To where His love can go 
 It reaches the highest high 
 And the lowest low 
 (Channel) 
 You took me from the dust-You made me 
 All over through and through-You know me 
 Not willing for me to die {Reached down and saved me with Your precious...} 
 (Vamp) 
 Loved on me, Loved on me, Loved on me, Loved on me 
 Loved on me, Loved on me, Loved on me, Loved on me 
 (Channel) 
 You took me from the dust-You made me 
 All over through and through-You know me 
 Not willing for me to die {Reached down and saved me with Your precious...}

Lately we just pass each other by 
 We always say we'll get together 
 But we never find the time 
 To cherish and enjoy what we have together 
 (Chorus A) 
 Make time for love (love, love) 
 Don't make it hard (whoa) 
 You see life is way too short 
 And much too fragile 
 We both must pitch in and do our part 
 Make time for love 
 And you'll see it will get better 
 Make time for love 
 Make time for love 
 We don't communicate 
 This is the key 
 You say I never really talk to you 
 And you, you never talk to me 
 I don't understand 
 Just how our lives got away 
 (Chorus B) 
 Make time for love 
 Oh for love just make time (whoa) 
 You see life is way too short 
 Way too fragile 
 We both must pitch in and do our part 
 Make time for love 
 And you'll see it will get better 
 Make time for love 
 Make time for love 
 Our relationship is not what is should be 
 You see we've gotta to turn some things around 
 And make our love 
 Priority 
 (Chorus C) 
 Make time for love 
 Oh for love just make time (whoa) 
 I know it's hard 
 You see life is way too short 
 And much too fragile 
 We both must pitch in and do our part 
 Make time for love 
 And you'll see it will get better 
 Make time for love 
 Make time... 
 (Pre-Vamp) 
 I sure would like to see you smile 
 What if I called in and changed some things around 
 I hear you say you feel the same way 
 Put me in your planner for the whole day 
 (Vamp) 
 (Tell me how does that sound)-Make time for love, Make time for love 
 (Gotta do somethin' 'fore it all breaks down)-Make time for love, Make time for love 
 (What if I could hold your hand)-Make time for love, Make time for love 
 (Walk you down the street and lets start again)-Make time for love, Make time for love 
 (Before it's all too late)-Whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Make time for love, Make time for love 
 Make time for love, Make time for love 
 (Out)

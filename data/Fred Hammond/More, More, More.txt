I need more, more, more 
 Jesus more of You 
 I need so much more 
 Jesus more, more, more 
 When I have been all used up 
 Fill me like an empty cup 
 And when it seems I have had enough 
 I still need more, more, more 
 The hunger inside of me 
 My spirit and soul agree 
 I've tasted and now I see 
 I need more of You 
 I need more, more, more 
 Jesus more of You 
 I need so much more 
 Jesus more, more, more 
 If I'm in the desert place 
 Or dry as an empty vase 
 Fill me up till it's to the top 
 I'll still need more, more, more 
 Like numbers go to infinity 
 Or an endless eternity 
 Like the universe just goes on and on 
 I need more of you 
 I need more, more, more 
 Jesus more of You 
 I need so much more 
 Jesus more, more, more 
 Lord, I need more 
 I need more, I need more 
 I need more, more, more 
 Jesus more of You 
 (More of You) 
 I need so much more 
 (So much more) 
 Jesus more, more, more 
 I need more, more, more 
 When I have been all used up 
 (I need more, more, more) 
 God fill me like an empty cup 
 (Jesus more of You) 
 And when it seems I have had enough 
 (I need so much more) 
 I still need more, more, more 
 (Jesus more, more, more)

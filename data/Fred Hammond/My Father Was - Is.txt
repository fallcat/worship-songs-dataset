Who was there when I first opened up my eyes? 
 And who was there to heal the hurt 
 When I first learned to ride? 
 And who never missed a game 
 Celebrate me won or loss? 
 Yes my Father was 
 When adolescent years had come who helped me understand? 
 And when the winning point was scored 
 Who in victory raised my hand? 
 And when I hung my head in shame 
 Who was there to lift it up? 
 Yes my Father was 
 My Heavenly Father has always been there 
 For my earthly one was gone yeah 
 He's taken care of me 
 And I only want to be just like Him 
 Now that I'm a full grown man 
 Who can wipe my tears away? 
 And who's on the other end 
 When I lift my heart to pray? 
 And who's always by my side 
 To help me make it through? 
 Yes my Father is 
 My Heavenly Father is 
 Yes he is 
 Yes my Father is

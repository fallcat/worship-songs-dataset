(Background vocals) Whoa ooh oa oa oa ooooa 
 Trusting in someone who's made of flesh and blood 
 Such a frightful situation 
 Continual emotional intensive care 
 Is from too high expectations 
 So like a flower depends on rainfall 
 And like true lovers depend on phone calls 
 Like a song needs a tune 
 My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you) 
 Some folks build their life only on wealth and fame 
 Or if they get high place employment 
 Not knowing they're building hopes and dreams on sand 
 They soon are disappointed (disappointed) 
 So like a good day (good day) depends on sunshine (on sunshine) 
 And like the harvest depends on the time 
 Like the tide needs the moon 
 My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you) 
 On Your Holy Word I am standing 
 For every word is true 
 That's why I'm trusting in You 
 Like a comedian needs to be funny 
 And like a banker depends on money 
 Like a bride needs a groom 
 My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you) 
 On Your Holy Word I am standing 
 For every word is true 
 That's why I'm trusting in You 
 I trust You 
 (Repeat x2, then out) (After x2, simultaneously) 
 My heart depends on you You know my heart 
 My heart depends on you You know my heart 
 My heart depends on you You know my heart 
 My heart Depends on You 
 My heart 
 My heart 
 Just like the flower depends on rainfall 
 Just like a good day depends on blue skies 
 My heart depends on yooooou 
 Just like a banker 
 Depends on money 
 Just like a bride 
 Needs a groom 
 You know my heart depends on You

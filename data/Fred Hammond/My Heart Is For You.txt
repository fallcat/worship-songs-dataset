 Album: Free To Worship 
 Now (now) we've come (we've come) 
 To give (give) You glory 
 Cause there's nobody like You 
 And all together we sing 
 To a mighty risen King 
 Now (now) we've come (we've come) 
 To give (give) You praise 
 Cause there's nobody like You 
 We lift our hands unashamed 
 To celebrate Your name 
 With singing we bless You Lord, 
 Singing we bless You Lord 
 With our hearts we do adore, 
 Our Hearts we do adore You Lord 
 Wonderful are Your ways, 
 Wonderful are Your ways 
 Please receive our praise, 
 So Lord our praise we give to You 
 Now (now) we've come (we've come) 
 To give (give) You worship 
 Cause there's nobody like You 
 And all together we sing 
 To a mighty risen King 
 You are the Lord of all, 
 You are the Lord of all 
 There every time we call, 
 For this we truly thank You Lord 
 So Lord with all our might 
 So Lord with all our might 
 We lift Your name on high, 
 Oh Lord we lift Your name 
 Vamp 1: 
 Can't make it without You 
 I'm nothing without You 
 You're the air I breathe 
 The song I sing 
 Oh Lord, My heart let it please You 
 My praise let it bless You 
 Let it be the sound You want to hear 
 Oh Lord 
 Vamp 2: 
 My heart will be for You Lord, always 
 My praise will be for you Lord always 
 My worship is to You Lord, always 
 My heart will be for You Lord

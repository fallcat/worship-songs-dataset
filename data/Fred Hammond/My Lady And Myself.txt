We started out so deep in love, We knew it was from God above 
 Two hearts as one, each other we adored. 
 Now bitter winds begin to blow, And blocks the warmth we used to know 
 To hide the feelings that were there before 
 Gone are the glad times, Smiles warm and tender 
 If she'd look into me, I'm sure she'd remember 
 That there's a loving Inside me worth saving 
 So I stand praying for my lady and myself. 
 My lady, My Lady and myself 
 This car's grown cold I'm sitting in, It's getting late I should go in 
 But my hands and head still lay here on the wheel 
 Two men exist inside of me, one say's stay and one say's leave 
 Does anybody know just how I feel? 
 Gone are the glad times, Smiles warm and tender 
 If I could look deeper, I'm sure I'd remember 
 That she's baby, I don't maybe 
 So I stand praying for my lady and myself. 
 My baby, My baby and myself 
 We've weathered storms before, Been through challenges galore. 
 Now we've become, Two instead of one. 
 But it breaks my heart when I, See tears fall from her eyes 
 Lord will you help us, 'Cause I don't know what to do? 
 I love her, (But I don't know what to do) 
 I'm standing, Calling you, Calling you Lord, I'm calling you Lord 
 As I stand Praying for my Lady and Myself 
 I love her, (We won't make it without You) 
 I'm standing, Calling you (The Cold winds have come to take Your love away) 
 (But we're a family and I need to know, can I find the strength to hang on 
 In there) 
 (I hate to see her cry O' Lord, but it's been so long, where did we go wrong) 
 (Please help us see, what we need to be to each other, to each other) 
 She's my lady, She's my lady, She's my lady

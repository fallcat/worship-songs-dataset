(If you know the Lord is good let me hear you say) 
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my God is good 
 (If you know the Lord is good let me hear you say) 
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my God is good 
 He woke you up this morning 
 To see a brand new day, yeah 
 His eyes are fixed upon us 
 Filled with mercy and with grace 
 (Channel 1) 
 In case you didn't realize 
 How wonderful He is 
 Keep this in mind 
 And don't forget it 
 In all your days you'll never find 
 No one like Him 
 (Bridge A) 
 If you know without a doubt 
 Then let me hear you proclaim it out loud 
 As we lift our hearts in worship 
 And our mouths filled with praise 
 Thinking how He surely loves us 
 And our hands are steadily raised 
 Can you say 
 (Channel 2) 
 With no shame, stand and tell the world 
 How wonderful He is 
 In all your days you'll never find 
 No one like Him 
 (Bridge B) 
 If you know without a doubt 
 Stand up and proclaim it out loud 
 Let me hear you say it 
 See those hands a waivin', my God 
 My, my, my, my, my, my 
 (Bridge C) 
 Just think of all the ways 
 That He blesses 
 His kindness and His love 
 Never fails 
 Let's sing and tell the world 
 Of His goodness 
 Compassion just goes on and on 
 (Pre-Vamp) 
 (Do you love Him) Yes 
 (Do you know He's good) Oh Yes 
 (Do You really know) Oh yes, oh yes

 And we love Him 
 He's good, God is always good 
 (Do you love Him) Yes 
 (Is He good) Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes 
 God is always good 
 In all your days you'll never find 
 No one like Him 
 (Old Flow) 
 Aw, let me tell you somethin' that you should've known (oh yeah) 
 It must have blazed across your dome but you wasn't for sure, what (oh yeah) 
 Take it from the back to the front of your mind (oh yeah) 
 God is always good and that's all the time

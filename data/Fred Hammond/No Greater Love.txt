There is no greater love, No greater love 
 Than the one You have for me Lord 
 Your mercy so tender, Erasing my transgressions 
 There is none greater, There is none greater 
 Vamp: 
 Your love for me is forever, Your love for me is forever 
 To me there is none greater, to me there is none greater 
 Your love for me is forever, Your love for me is forever 
 No greater, no greater, no greater, no greater

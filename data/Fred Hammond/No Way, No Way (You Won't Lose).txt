Uh huh, yeah 
 Uh huh 
 Woke up to the sound of morning news 
 Looking out the window 
 Things was cool 
 Checking on my list of things to do 
 And everything's all right 
 Telephone rings and then I learned 
 My life tries to take a drastic turn 
 The world tries to cave in, do you hear me 
 Before 10:AM 
 But no way 
 No way, no way you won't lose 
 I hear You Lord, reassuring me 
 Again, again 
 You have shown 
 You're in control of everything 
 (Special Chorus) 
 One thing is crystal clear 
 (It's clear to me0 
 You cover my inabilities 
 (Yes You do) 
 When everything is going down 
 You turn it around, around. 
 Now you know you got an enemy 
 A fair fight is not his strategy 
 But we can take complete authority 
 And let that joker know 
 With the armor of the Lord 
 We standing strong 
 And even if we take a hit we're moving on 
 Let's stay in there my friend 
 'Cause his word declares we win 
 (Ad lib 1) 
 If you love Him 
 Let me see you do this (Yeah) 
 Praise Him in your trouble 
 Raise your hands like this (Yeah) 
 Believe He will deliver 
 Let me see you do this (Yeah) 
 If you believe the Word 
 Let me hear you say (Yeah) 
 (Ad-lib 2) 
 Are you more than a conqueror (uh huh yeah) 
 Are you more than a conqueror, (say, uh huh) 
 That the power of God is enough, (uh huh yeah) 
 And we can do anything in His name, (uh huh) 
 Are you more than a conqueror say, (uh huh yeah) 
 That you're more than a conqueror, true, (uh huh) 
 When the trouble get tight just believe, (uh huh yeah) 
 That the Lord is going to come to save you and me too, say huh 
 (Vamp) 
 You're the reason why 
 Victory is mine 
 That's the bottom line 
 You're the reason why 
 If it's a mountain 
 (I'll speak to it) 
 If I'm in the fire 
 (You'll see me through it) 
 What I can't do 
 (You'll see to it) 
 If I ask in Your name 
 (You will do it)

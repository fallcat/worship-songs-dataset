No weapon formed against me 
 Shall prosper, it won't work. (repeat4x's) 
 GOD will do what He said He would do 
 He will stand by His word, He will come through 
 No weapon formed against me 
 Shall prosper, it won't work.(repeat 2x's) 
 GOD will do what He said 
 He would do, Hes not a man that He should lie 
 He will come through say 
 GOD will do what He said He would do He will stand 
 By His word He will come through 
 Oh, I won't be afraid of the arrows by day 
 From the hand of my enemy. 
 I can stand my ground with the LORD on my side 
 For the snares they have SET will not succeed. 
 GOD will do what He said He would He will stand by 
 His word He will come through 
 Chorus repeat

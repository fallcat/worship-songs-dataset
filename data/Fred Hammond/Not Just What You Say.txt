Not just what you say... Not just what you say 
 Not just what you say... Not just what you say 
 Then we can act like we know what love is... 
 When you say how are you doin' 
 Do you really wanna know 
 And are you concerned, yeah 
 And if you had the solution 
 But it took some of your time or some cash or whatever 
 Are you willing 
 Not just what you say {It's mostly what you do} 
 Not a game that you play {To keep the winning hand with you} 
 Not just wasting time {With empty words that don't mean much} 
 Not just how you feel {When others need your tender touch} 
 So can you take out some time {To help somebody else in need} 
 And when this is done {The love of God is truly seen} 
 Then above all {We need to cover and forgive} 
 Then we can act like we know what love is 
 Love is compassion 
 That makes you reach way down 
 And help your fellow man 
 So if there's a need 
 And you can be the one 
 Go and help someone 
 (Vamp) 
 Love is all, all in all 
 Forgiving faults great and small 
 Patient and willing to 
 Cover me, cover you 
 Love is kind don't you know 
 And will not seek its own 
 God is love forever more 
 Act like you know go handle yours 
 (Repeat Vamp)

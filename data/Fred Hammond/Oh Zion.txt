Oh Zion! Put on thy strength 
 For the glory of the Lord 
 Is hidden within thee 
 Oh Zion! Put on thy strength 
 Be fortified, arise and conquer 
 Oh Zion! 
 Saints of the Most High 
 It's time for us to stand on 
 The covenant that our God has made 
 Oh Zion! 
 That He is faithful 
 And always by our side 
 So there's no reason to be dismayed 
 Oh Zion! 
 So be courageous and not of a 
 Fearful heart 
 As an army we are able to stand 
 Oh Zion! 
 Too long we've waited 
 Let us hesitate no more 
 Let us march right in and possess 
 The land 
 Oh Zion! Put on thy strength 
 For the glory of the Lord 
 Is hidden within thee 
 Oh Zion! Put on thy strength 
 Be fortified, arise and conquer 
 Oh Zion! 
 We are His people 
 Better known as the blessed of God 
 And our minds sometimes we must elevate 
 Oh Zion! 
 We can do all things 
 So there's no room for fear and doubt 
 Let us take a stand, it's no time to faint 
 No time 
 Oh Zion! 
 Oh Zion arise with the armor of the 
 Lord 
 Let us fight for this is our finest hour, 
 Yeah 
 Oh Zion! 
 Oh Zion! Put on thy strength 
 For the glory of the Lord 
 Is hidden within thee 
 Oh Zion! Put on thy strength 
 Be fortified, arise and conquer 
 Oh Zion! 
 Armed in the Spirit and believing His 
 Holy sword 
 Let us march and take the city with 
 Power

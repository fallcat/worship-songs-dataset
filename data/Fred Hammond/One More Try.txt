Lets try this once again 
 Don't let it come to an end 
 For if we just let it go we'll never know what it could be 
 Lets make it one more try at love 
 Lets say we will again 
 Never be untrue again 
 For if we say it's lost 
 There goes our once upon a dream 
 Lets make it one more try at love 
 One more one more try 
 Don't let our love come to an end 
 Have faith in us again 
 Let us share a tender warm embrace 
 Till all our tears are gone 
 Lets make it one more try at love 
 One more one more try 
 One more 
 Can we give it one more try 
 Can we give it one more 
 'Cause I love you 
 And I know you love me 
 One more try

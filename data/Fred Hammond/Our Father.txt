 We love to call you 
 By your grace you have adopted 
 Now we're your children 
 You now receive us 
 Joint heirs with Jesus 
 Our father, our father

 Your awesome love 
 You've shown to us 
 Goes beyond our wildest dreams 
 You saturate our lives with grace amd mercy 
 And because you love 
 You chasten us 
 If we should go astray 
 Like a father

(Verse One) 
 Why downcast oh, my soul 
 Having a heavy heart in hand 
 Knowing full his promise still remains 
 That He would safely guide 
 If on his shoulders I would lean 
 And his perfect will I would remain 
 (Verse Two) 
 The battle rages on 
 And weakens my confidence 
 Confusion urges me to curse the day 
 But when I patient wait 
 Under the shadow of His wing 
 Then I softly hear the Spirit say 
 The peace that passes on 
 All your understanding 
 Shall guard your heart and mind 
 Through Christ Jesus 
 (Repeat)

There was a blind man on the road side, and he heard a commotion yeah 
 It was Jesus passing by with a crowd and it stirred his emotions 
 He'd been displaced his whole life, should he even try 
 Oh 
 Don't bother Jesus (they say you have nothing) 
 You have nothing to offer (stay in your place) 
 Right then he knew (he had to choose) 
 He had nothing to lose 
 So he cried Jesus (Jesus), I need you, (yeah ah) please don't pass me by 
 He cried out Jesus, I'm not ashamed (to tell you) I need you in my life 
 (I need you in my life yeah) 
 I'm not much different from that man, and this is the honest truth 
 Could this sinful one, with this messed up life, could I ever serve you 
 (Oh oh oh oh) people and things clutter my mind, should I even try 
 Oh 
 Don't bother Jesus (they say you have nothing) 
 You have nothing to offer (stay in your place) 
 I must admit (when I think about it all) 
 I need you in my life 
 So I cry Jesus (Jesus), I need you 
 Please don't pass me by 
 I'm crying out Jesus, I'm not ashamed to tell you I need you in my life 
 As the deer (as the deer panted) 
 Thirsty for the water yeah (thirsty for the water) 
 My soul desires and longs to be (to be with you) 
 Jesus, I need you, please don't pass me by 
 I don't mean to waste your time but I can't listen to the crowd, 
 Situations in my life telling me to keep it down 
 But I need you 
 I know I'm broken, but you can heal me, Jesus, Jesus I'm calling you 
 (I might not be worth much) might not be worth much, but I'm still willing 
 Jesus, Jesus, I'm calling you 
 ... Till fade

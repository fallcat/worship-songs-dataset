In these old days we call the last 
 As Your glorious return is approaching fast 
 It's not enough for us to sit and wait 
 As Your awesome power on Earth we must demonstrate 
 As Your children who seek Your face 
 We sincerely come to You 
 'Cause we can't move until You saturate us, oh Lord 
 Oh Lord won't You please pour out Your Holy Spirit 
 Come on let it rain on us 
 With the oil of Your anointing 
 And Your glory like a flood 
 As sons and daughters, Lord, we do rely 
 On Your word that said we'd prophesize 
 And being strong in faith, flesh we defeat 
 And the Gospel in our mouth we set the captives free 
 As Your children who seek Your face 
 We sincerely come to You 
 'Cause we can't move until You saturate us 
 Oh Lord, won't You please pour out Your Holy Spirit 
 Come on let it rain on us 
 With the oil of Your anointing 
 And Your glory like a flood 
 Pour out Your Holy Spirit 
 Come on let it rain on us 
 With the oil of Your anointing 
 And Your glory like a flood 
 These are the days 
 You said You would let it rain 
 These are the days 
 You said You would let it rain 
 These are the days 
 You said You would let it rain 
 These are the days 
 You said You would let it rain 
 These are the days 
 You said You would let it rain 
 These are the days 
 You said You would let it rain

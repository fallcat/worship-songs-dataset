In the beginning, God created the heavens and earth 
 This whole wide world where we live 
 And since that day, everything that He made still lives 
 Now we, the saints of the Most High, shall arise 
 This is our finest hour to show the whole world 
 The God we serve has awesome power 
 He's given us power 
 He is the only one with all the power 
 The undefeated champion 
 From the beginning, 'til time is no more 
 You can be sure, sure 
 Who else can cause the water to divide 
 So His children can cross the other side 
 Talkin' 'bout when Pharaoh chased them down 
 His army went in, but every single one of them got drowned 
 Never be another power like Him 
 There's no one beside Him 
 There's no one above Him 
 Never be another power 
 No power, like Him, Him 
 Power 
 He is the only one with all the power 
 The undefeated champion 
 From the beginning, 'til time is no more 
 You can be sure, sure 
 Look at me, I can testify 
 This powerful God really is on my side 
 Even when the enemy tried to take me out 
 My God stepped in, and He proved beyond a shadow of a doubt 
 That there will never be 
 Never be another power like Him 
 There's no one beside Him 
 There's no one above Him 
 Never be another power 
 No power, like Him, Him

{Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa} 
 Can I moan a little bit, hey 
 {Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa} 
 Hey, All the brothers, all my sista's, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Worthy, worthy 
 You know what I mean 
 Is the Lamb of God who gave His life to make us clean 
 What an awesome price was paid 
 So I lift up my voice to say I love You 
 Thank you, thank you 
 Hear what I'm sayin' 
 To the Lord of my life, forevermore 
 That's how it's layin' 
 All the nations, all the people 
 If you love Him let me hear you say we lift... 
 We lift Your name on high 
 The Savior of our lives 
 The Way, the Truth, the Light 
 My, oh, my, oh, my 
 Praise belongs to You 
 Glory, glory 
 I said it before 
 I'm sayin' it now 
 And I'll be sayin' it forevermore 
 All power belongs to You 
 So with all of my heart I give You honor 
 Holy, Holy 
 Lord God almighty 
 Who sits on the throne of my heart 
 All day and nighty 
 All the brothers 
 All the sisters 
 If you love Him let me hear you say we lift... 
 We lift Your name on high 
 The Savior of our lives 
 The Way, the Truth, the Light 
 My, oh, my, oh, my 
 Praise belongs to You 
 (Vamp A) 
 You're worthy, so worthy 
 You are Lord and Lord alone 
 You're worthy, so worthy 
 The Holy King upon the throne 
 You're worthy, so worthy 
 To be praised forevermore 
 My, oh, my, oh, my 
 (Vamp B) 
 Dominion and glory 
 Lion and the Lamb so Holy 
 You are the all knowing 
 All power belongs to You 
 So worthy, You're so worthy 
 My, oh, my, oh, my 
 Praise belongs to You

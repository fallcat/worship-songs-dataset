The day has passed and darkness comes to settle in, 
 Ooh no, oh. 
 Confusion rolls in like a fog, 
 And I can't see my way. 
 Now doubt believes, 
 It can make my faith seem paper thin, 
 Ooh no. oh. 
 The peace and joy that I have known, 
 Has been replaced. 
 (This time), 
 This time with tears and sadness, 
 (Midnight), 
 The midnight for the day, 
 (Sorrow), 
 Sorrow instead gladness, 
 But with all that is in me, 
 I'll still say... 
 That I will praise Him through the night, 
 And I will worship in the fight. 
 I'll Praise Him forever, 
 Because I know that He's worthy. 
 Praise Him over the adversary, 
 We'll overcome. 
 The wicked one, whose fury runs with anger deep, 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 Destruction is his only goal 
 Against our side. 
 With hatred strong, 
 He demands we declare defeat, no, oh. 
 He says he's won, 
 But we all know that he's a lie. 
 When fear moves our foundation, 
 (Just know that God), 
 Know that God has not forsaken. 
 (He will bring), 
 He'll bring a brighter day, 
 So let me hear the people of God say... 
 When the battle gets too much for me to take, 
 We're gonna praise Him. 
 When I can't see through the wind and rain, 
 We're still gonna praise Him, yes, we will. 
 In my darkest hour, 
 We're gonna praise Him still. 
 When it's weary, dark and lifeless, 
 We're gonna praise Him. 
 When hope seems like its almost gone, 
 We're still gonna praise Him, yes, we will. 
 In my darkest hour, 
 We're gonna praise Him still. 
 Vamp: 
 We'll overcome when we praise Him. 
 We'll overcome, yes, we will, 
 We'll overcome 
 Keep on praising, 
 We'll overcome. 
 Ending: 
 Praise Him forever, 
 For I know that He's worthy. 
 Praise Him over the adversary, 
 We will overcome!

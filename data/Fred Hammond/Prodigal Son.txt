The loneliest place in the world is without You 
 Too many of my days Lord, I've tried to spend there 
 Searching for what I know was only found in You 
 I strayed so far away, I wasn't sure You were still there 
 But deep in my heart was a faint security 
 And I could almost feel Your open arms 
 And hear You say to me 
 Prodigal son, come back to my love 
 You are the one, that my heart seeks for 
 Whatever you've done, I cannot even remember 
 Although there are many in my house 
 It's still empty without my prodigal son 
 Have You so much mercy You would pardon me 
 It's so hard to believe Your love would hide my sins 
 And even though You take the past far away from me 
 Could this be a chance to have my place in You again 
 Speak clear to me Lord that my faith would fully mend 
 If this is a chance to come home 
 Then would You please say again 
 And what makes you think, I'm no longer your Father 
 For nothing can separate you from My love 
 And each day I go out to the road where you departed 
 Saying maybe today my lost one will come 
 And in hopes of your return 
 I stand with open arms saying 
 (Chorus B) 
 Prodigal son, come back to my love 
 You are the one, that my heart seeks for 
 Whatever you've done, I cannot even remember 
 Although there are many in my house 
 Fulfill my joy and come to me prodigal son 
 (Repeat) 
 Please hurry home, because I love you

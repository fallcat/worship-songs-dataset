Seasons come and then they go 
 But all You've established shall hold fast 
 And on that we can rest assured 
 And beyond all imaginations 
 Every promise You have given me will come true 
 I see You, so sovereign 
 You are the only God so wise 
 In Your hands You hold my times 
 I can hold You to Your word 
 You're never wavering 
 You won't turn, for I am sure 
 You are the Promise Keeper 
 Exceeding all my expectations 
 I find myself believing You with no hesitation 
 'Cause You've proven to me You're awesome 
 I can so clearly see my life is Yours, El Shaddai 
 (Chorus B) 
 I see You, so sovereign 
 You are the only God so wise 
 In Your hands You hold my times 
 I can hold You to Your word 
 You're never wavering 
 You won't turn, for I am sure (for I know) 
 You are the Promise Keeper 
 Heaven and earth will pass away 
 Before one word You speak will ever fade 
 Promise Keeper, Promise Keeper, Promise Keeper 
 I can hold You to Your word 
 You're never wavering, You won't turn 
 For I am sure (For I know) 
 You are the Promise Keeper

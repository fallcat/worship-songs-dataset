How can you forgive me when I've often gone astray 
 How can you think of me when I do things my way 
 Turning my back from you 
 The one who loved me first 
 Having my own desires 
 Renewing worldly thirst 
 You told me you loved me and I should make up my mind 
 You tell me come back now, but I keep wasting time 
 Feeling so very weak you say I can be strong 
 I feel I've gone too far you tell me to come home 
 You love me still 
 And I know this is real 
 And I am running back to you 
 I see your standing there for me 
 Your arms are opened wide 
 And I don't have to cry no more 
 You're standing there for me 
 And I am running back to you, 
 Why do I go away when I know I am no good when I'm on my own. 
 You told me you could keep me, but I've turned it away 
 I failed you so much now I don't know what to say 
 Using the same excuse that I am just a man 
 You tell me you've been there and hold your nail scarred hands so I can see 
 Now I know I am free 
 And I am running back to you 
 I see your standing there for me 
 Your arms are opened wide 
 And I don't have to cry no more 
 You're standing there for me and I am running back to you, 
 Why do I go away when I know I am no good when I'm on my own. 
 I have taken advantage of your love and grace 
 Forgive me Lord and take me home, take me home. 
 I'm running to you Jesus please take me home, 
 You see I've been in this wrong way too long and I can't do right anymore. 
 I'm tired of pain and I don't like fear but Lord I want to be more sincere. 
 I never should have left your side. 
 Return me to your guiding light 
 I'm running back to you 
 I see you standing there for me.

The children of Israel versus Jericho 
 God promised them the city 
 They marched around the walls, hey 
 On the seventh time around 
 They let the trumpet 
 And Joshua stood and said 
 C'mon everybody shout 
 Shout unto God, with the voice of triumph 
 Let's sing and rejoice, for His name is great 
 C'mon let's celebrate, say 
 You've been making progress 
 But now you hit a well, yes sir 
 Don't forget, hey 
 That He is in your corner, yes He is 
 And before one single round 
 Know that the winner you've been found 
 And when you hear these words 
 Let's get ready to rumble 
 Stand and shout, yeah 
 When you face your foe 
 Like the walls of Jericho 
 You just need to know 
 He has given us the victory 
 There is no need to worry 
 'Cause He is our salvation 
 (Vamp) 
 Shout, sing and rejoice 
 Celebrate Him, celebrate 
 Lift your voice and sing 
 He is the mighty King 
 He's Lord of everything, He is God eternal 
 (Repeat)

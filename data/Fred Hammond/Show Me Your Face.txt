Closer 
 Yeah 
 Show me your face 
 Need to see you clearly 
 No more mistakes 
 Look at all the time I'm losing 
 More than your mercy 
 Lord will you take me 
 Closer, (show me) let me see your face 
 Verse 1 (Fred): 
 It's the hardest thing that I ever had to do 
 And that's admit the truth 
 The reason I missed you was all because of me 
 Seemed okay at the time 
 But now I find 
 It wasn't worth it, it wasn't worth it 
 Heres what I'm counting on with you 
 Lord you know me through and through 
 Remove the broken pieces 
 All the fragments and debris 
 Till there's nothing left of me 
 And I say, here is a heart yielded totally, totally 
 Fred:Now there's one thing left to do 
 Choir:One thing left to do 
 Fred:Everything else must move 
 Choir:Everything else must move 
 Fred:Gotta Find the place 
 Both:Where I can see your face, I can see your face 
 Fred:Now my secrets turn to say 
 Choir:Secrets turn to say 
 Fred:And I need more than a word 
 Choir:Need more than just a word 
 Fred:Put me in the place 
 Choir:where I can see your, see your face 
 Choir and Fred: 
 I need to see your face 
 See your face 
 Put me in the place 
 Where I can see your face 
 See your face, See your face 
 Put me in the place 
 Where I can see your face 
 See your face, see your face 
 Put me in the place 
 Where I can see your face, can see your face

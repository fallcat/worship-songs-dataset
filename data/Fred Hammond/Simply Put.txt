I don't really need 
 To tell someone their future 
 I don't really have to see the things 
 That can't be seen 
 I don't need another 
 Hyped up church encounter 
 Or another clever new Years theme 
 I'm not looking for another goose bump sermon 
 Or a word that leaves me passed out on the floor 
 My basic needs are really very simple 
 To know You love me 
 You like me 
 And I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 Bridge A: 
 My learning could go on throughout the ages 
 But I just need the plain and simple of what's real 
 I could memorize and quote a million pages 
 But I'd rather just express the way I feel 
 I've tried so hard to know 
 The deepest revelation 
 So I could stand and tell the nations 
 What it means 
 But I found the greatest gift 
 Wrapped in Your salvation 
 It's really much more simple than it seems 
 So I relinquish all my witty observations 
 Leave my so called sacred knowledge at the door 
 When You died You answered every single question 
 You said You love me 
 You like me 
 And I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 Bridge B: 
 My learning could go on throughout the ages 
 But I just need the plain and simple of what's real 
 I could memorize and quote a million pages 
 But I'd rather just express the way I feel 
 All those complicated things have no appeal 
 So I'd rather keep it simple, keep it real 
 Yes I'm done with all the things that make it 
 Difficult to know 
 Vamp: 
 You love me 
 You like me [x3] 
 And I am Yours

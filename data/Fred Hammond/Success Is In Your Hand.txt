Success is in your hand, follow My plan 
 I've called you for this hour, and placed in you My power 
 It's in your hand, follow My plan 
 I'll do exceedingly, above all you ask of Me 
 It's in your hand, follow My plan 
 Don't waiver to the left, don't waiver to the right 
 It's in your hand, follow My plan 
 I've called by you by My name 
 And you'll never be the same 
 It's in your hand, follow my plan

Praise 3x's 
 Lord I stand before You once again 
 I'm so glad that I know You understand 
 I done everything I know how to do 
 And as usual I end up crying out to You 
 I tried so hard to do my best 
 But I don't feel like I'll make it through this test 
 I can't remember feeling so much pain 
 And my tears keep falling like the pouring rain 
 I try to force myself to wear a smile but it's just not there 
 This pain I'm feeling deep inside my heart seems so unfair 
 It really feels like I won't make it through another day 
 So I stand before You with a broken heart and all I can say is; 
 Precious Lord please 
 Take my hand 
 (Do you know what I'm talking about out there) 
 (Lead me on) 
 Help me stand (help me to stand, please help me now) 
 See I can't front Lord standing here today 
 'Cause I stumbled here and there along the way 
 I'm praying even as I sing this song Lord 
 For my breakthrough I hope it won't be too long 
 I try to force myself to wear a smile but it's just not there 
 This pain I'm feeling deep down inside my heart seems so unfair 
 This time I feel like I won't make it through another day 
 So I come before You with a broken heart and all I can say is; 
 Precious Lord eh... 
 Take my hand 
 (Would you do that, would you please do that for me) 
 (Lead me on, lead me on 
 Help me stand (help me to stand, help me to stand) 
 Deep down I know You will come through 
 That's why I'm reaching, reaching out to You 
 'Cause I need to feel Your loving arms again 
 And when I feel Your loving touch that's when 
 I'll be ok, I will be ok I will make it it you take my hand 
 Take my hand (repeat 3x's) 
 Lead: 
 Lead me on lead me on Lord 
 I won't make it without You Jesus 
 I won't make it without You 
 Choir: 
 Hold me (repeat 2x's) 
 Lead: 
 Hold me (please hold me) 
 'Cause I'm standing here and I need Your touch 
 Choir: 
 Take my hand (repeat 3x's) 
 Lead: 
 I won't make it another day 
 'Cause I tried it my way 
 But these tears keep falling 
 And this pain keeps growing 
 Hold me 
 Choir: 
 Hold me (repeat) 
 Lead: 
 And if I know You're holding me then I can count on this 
 I know my breakthrough is on the way 
 Choir: 
 Breakthrough 
 Lead: 
 I can rest assure 
 With tears in my eyes 
 I can stand my ground 
 And I can say hold me Jesus 
 Help me Jesus 
 Here it is 
 Somebody say it like you mean it, yeah like you mean it 
 My situation might still be the same 
 But I'm counting on you 
 I know you'll come through You will 
 Gotta say yes 
 Choir: 
 Yes (repeat till end) 
 Lead: 
 My flesh will say yes 
 My tears will say yes 
 My heart will say yes 
 My change is on the way 
 And your change is on the way 
 Breakthrough, breakthrough

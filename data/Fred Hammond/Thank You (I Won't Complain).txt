There's a praise 
 That lives deep in my heart 
 And it says 
 Oh Lord I love You 
 I am blessed 
 When I think of Your goodness to me 
 It comforts me daily 
 But there are times in my life 
 When things don't work out right 
 And my burdens are heavy 
 And there's no joy in sight 
 Put my eyes back on You 
 For You've always come through 
 And with this simple refrain 
 I will bless You, bless You 
 Lord You've been 
 Good to me 
 You made the way 
 I could not see 
 Your love came in 
 And lifted me 
 And now, I won't complain 
 Through the years 
 You been there 
 To dry my tears 
 There is not 
 A closer friend 
 Than You 
 Oh Lord You have been 
 So good to me 
 More than this world could ever be 
 I really want to thank You 
 Lord I won't complain 
 Lift my hands 
 Give You praise in the midst of each storm 
 'Cause You are worthy 
 When life's sorrows and heartaches rush in 
 I will remember (You are still worthy) 
 Let the words of my mouth 
 Leave no room for doubt 
 Because down through the years 
 You've been faithful 
 And when I think it all through 
 Oh Lord it's been You 
 Who's been there all the time 
 And I'm grateful, grateful 
 Lord You've been 
 Good to me 
 You made the way 
 I could not see 
 Your love came in 
 And lifted me 
 And now, I won't complain 
 Through the years 
 You been there 
 To dry my tears 
 There is not 
 A closer friend 
 Than You 
 Lord I know that You know what's best for me 
 Even when my weary eyes can't see 
 I really want to thank You (really want to thank You yeah) 
 Lord I won't complain (Lord I won't complain) 
 Let the words of my mouth 
 Leave no room for doubt 
 Because down through the years You've been faithful 
 When I think it all through 
 Oh Lord it's been You 
 Who was there all the time and I'm grateful 
 Through it all 
 Through it all You've been there for me 
 Through it all 
 Through every trial, every heartache You've been there 
 Through it all 
 Every tear that I've cried Lord You've been there 
 I lift my hands and I give You the praise 
 Through it all 
 Down through the years every step that I had to take 
 Through it all 
 You've been there any time I'm falling 
 Through it all 
 All You've been there to hold me tight through the crazy times 
 I lift my hands and I'll give You the praise 
 You've been good 
 You've been good when I think of all You've done 
 You've been so good 
 It makes me want to shout for joy and give You glory 
 You've been good 
 There is no one like You, You've been so good yeah

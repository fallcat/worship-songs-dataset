Three boys risked their lives 
 In flames of fire they were sure to die 
 The king said bow they said we're not gonna do it 
 Although they went it, the Lord He brought it 
 (Channel) 
 He knows the path You take and even if it leads you to a rocky place 
 It's okay 
 Whatever you can think to ask, He can do much more 
 And you just say while you wait 
 Is there anything, anything 
 Anything too hard for Him 
 If it's impossible, do you need a miracle 
 Anything too hard for Him 
 Say you got a mountain 
 Seems like it won't move 
 No time to climb it it 
 You don't know what to do, hey 
 What about when 
 He brought a big giant down 
 With a stone in the hands of a little child 
 (Repeat Channel 2x)

 That ain't nothin', that ain't nothin', that ain't nothin', that ain't nothin' 
 That ain't nothin', that ain't nothin', that ain't nothin' 
 That ain't nothin' too hard

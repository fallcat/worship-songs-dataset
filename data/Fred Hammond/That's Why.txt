Thinking about You and me 
 And how much You really mean to me 
 It's hard to put it in words 
 So I'll say it within this melody 
 You have affected my life 
 Gave me the will to wanna love again 
 All that was wrong You made right 
 Oh Lord You've come to be my closest friend 
 (Chorus A) 
 Oh Lord I love You 
 That's why I adore You 
 That's why I trust You 
 Just because You're You 
 Throughout my struggles You kept me strong 
 Throughout my troubles You help me to hold on 
 Even when I felt like letting go 
 You gave me a reason to love You so much more 
 So I give my love to You in this song 
 To let You know that it's there forevermore 
 Though I don't show it as much as I should, yeah 
 You stay the same You just show me love 
 (Repeat Chorus A 1x) 
 (Channel) 
 From the way that You gave of Yourself 
 So willing to be all I need 
 And without any hesitation 
 I will do the same for You 
 (Chorus B) 
 Oh Lord I love You (That's why, that's why) 
 That's why I adore You 
 That's why I trust You (That's why, that's why) 
 Just because You're You 
 (Repeat Chorus B 1x} 
 (Vamp)

 You, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah 
 You, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah 
 You, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah 
 You, oh, oh, oh

When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart 
 I will dance like David danced 
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart 
 I will dance like David danced 
 I will dance, dance, dance like David danced 
 I will dance, dance, dance like David danced 
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart 
 I will pray like David prayed 
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart 
 I will pray like David prayed 
 I will pray, pray, pray like David prayed 
 I will pray, pray, pray like David prayed 
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart 
 I will sing like David sang 
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart 
 I will sing like David sang 
 I will sing, I will sing, sing like David sang 
 I will sing, I will sing, sing like David sang 
 I will pray, I will pray, pray like David prayed 
 I will pray, I will pray, pray like David prayed 
 I will dance, I will dance, dance like David danced 
 I will dance, I will dance, dance like David danced 
 I will dance, I will dance, dance, dance 
 (Repeat)

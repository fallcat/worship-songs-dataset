There is no place 
 There is no place 
 There is no place 
 Like the will of God 
 There is no word 
 There is no word 
 There is no word 
 Like the word of God 
 There is no love 
 There is no love 
 There is no love 
 Like the love of God 
 Like the will, like the word 
 Like the love, love will cover 
 Like the will, like the word 
 Like the love of God 
 There is no peace 
 There is no joy 
 There is no life 
 Like the life in God 
 There is no love 
 There is no word 
 There is no place 
 Like the leaf, love of God 
 Like the word of the Lord 
 Like the love of God 
 The love of God

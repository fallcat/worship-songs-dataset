Listen, to those of you that are going through 
 For those of us that are waiting on his promise 
 Understand God has not forgotten you 
 When times get tough, you got to look up to heaven 
 And encourage yourself, and sing 
 They that wait on the Lord 
 Shall renew their strength 
 They shall mount up on wings 
 Just like an eagle and soar 
 They shall run and not be weary 
 They shall walk and never faint 
 They that wait on the Lord 
 And I say wait on the Lord 
 Hold on a little while longer 
 Here's what you got to do 
 Trust and believe my friend 
 He'll work it out for you 
 One thing you must remember 
 My God is able and 
 He cares for you 
 He cares for you 
 Wait on the Lord and He will come through 
 Wait on the Lord, He will answer you 
 Wait on the Lord and He won't be long 
 Wait on the Lord, He's going to work for they that wait 
 They that wait on the Lord 
 Shall renew their strength 
 They shall mount up on wings 
 Just like an eagle and soar 
 They shall run and not be weary 
 They shall walk and never faint 
 They that wait on the Lord 
 And I say wait on the Lord 
 Hold on a little while longer 
 Here's what you got to do 
 Trust and believe my friend 
 He'll work it out for you 
 One thing you must remember 
 My God is able and 
 He cares for you 
 He cares for you 
 Wait on the Lord and He will come through 
 Wait on the Lord, He will answer you 
 Wait on the Lord and He won't be long 
 Wait on the Lord 
 They that wait upon him 
 Shall have renewed strength 
 They shall mount up on wings like eagles and soar 
 I'm so glad 
 I've learned how to wait 
 In the midst of my waiting 
 I'm gonna bless His name 
 They that wait on the Lord 
 Shall renew their strength 
 They shall mount up on wings 
 Just like an eagle and soar 
 They shall run and not be weary 
 They shall walk and never faint 
 They that wait on the Lord 
 And I say wait on the Lord 
 Wait on the Lord and He will come through 
 Wait on the Lord, He will answer you 
 Wait on the Lord and He won't be long 
 Wait on the Lord 
 Let me see you break it down with me 
 Let me see you break it down with me 
 Wave your hands and shake your hands 
 And tell your neighbor 
 Hold on a little while longer 
 Hold on, hold on 
 Hold on a little while longer 
 Hold on, hold on 
 Hold on a little while longer 
 Hold on, hold on 
 Hold on a little while longer 
 Hold on, hold on

 And tell him don't give up

 Wait on Him, wait on Him 
 Wait on Him, wait on Him 
 Wait on Him, wait on Him

There is a love that's so complete, 
 When I came around it, it knocked me off of my feet 
 This love I found is certified, 
 It healed my body and ceased my troubled mind 
 The love of Jesus, say, what the song's about 
 When it dwells within, it'll make you scream and shout 
 I'm so glad that I have found 
 A love like this could turn my life around 
 Unconditional, Your love is truly unconditional 
 And I've found it to be 
 Unconditional and I will let the world know 
 I wanna thank you for the love You've shown 
 I'm not selfish to think the joy is gone 
 Truly gave all that you had to give 
 You lived and gave up Your life that I could live 
 Here's one more thing that I need to let You know, 
 Since I found You, I let the others go 
 No one can tell the world how to be free 
 Show the love that You gave to me! 
 There is not enough world that I could ever say about You 
 Come on say, Hey! Take it up! Say heh! 
 But two words come to mind and they come without a catch 
 And all this showed to me is that I must take the test 
 Vamp: 
 Unconditional Love! 
 (Vamp lead: Improvise) 
 The love that I found! He died for me! He did it to set me free! Come on! Come on say hey! 
 So glad that I got it!

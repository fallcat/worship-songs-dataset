Let's face the facts, hey yeah 
 With their spirits hopeless, bruised and broken 
 So much we lack 
 More defeated words have not been spoken 
 Out of twelve who stood to speak their mind 
 The report was filed by ten 
 But the last two stood with quite a different spin 
 They said I don't agree with those who say 
 In our own eyes we are small 
 For we serve a true and living God 
 And He is the Lord of all 
 (Channel 1) 
 And if He said the land is ours then we 
 Should move ahead with no delay 
 (Chorus A) 
 (You know that we) We are more than able 
 (You know that we) We are more than able 
 (You know that we) We are more than able 
 Yes we are 
 When asked to give 
 A true assessment for the task before you 
 Stop and re-live 
 The many ways His mighty arms has brought you through 
 Remember every lion's den 
 And don't forget your last red sea 
 Know with God there's endless possibilities 
 So let us see ourselves as those can 
 Even if we can't see how 
 Let us see and dream, possess and build 
 Even if giants live there now 
 (Channel 2) 
 'Cause if He says the land is ours then we 
 Should move ahead with no delay 
 (Chorus B) 
 We are more than able 
 (Come on, you know that we) We are more than able 
 (You know that we) We are more than able 
 Yes we are, yes we can, yes we will, 'Cause we're more 
 We are more, we are more 
 (Repeat Channel 1) 
 (Repeat Chorus A) 
 (Vamp) 
 Yes we are say, yes we are say 
 With the Lord on our side we can do it, yeah 
 Yes we are say, yes we are say 
 With the Lord on our side we can do it, yeah 
 Yes we can say, yes we can say 
 With the Lord on our side we can do it, yeah 
 Yes we can say, yes we can say 
 With the Lord on our side we can do it, yeah 
 Yes we will say, yes we will say 
 With the Lord on our side we can do it, yeah 
 Yes we will say, yes we will say 
 With the Lord on our side we can do it, yeah 
 (Tenors:) More than able, we are more than able 
 (Altos:) More than able, more, more than able, more 
 (Sopranos:) Yes we are, yes we are, yes we are, yes we are, so much more 
 (Repeat)

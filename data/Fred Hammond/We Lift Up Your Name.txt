Salvation and glory belong to our God 
 And unto the Lamb on the throne. 
 Blessing and honor, wisdom and power, 
 Be unto God alone 
 Hallelujah, glory to the Lamb. 
 Hallelujah, to the Great I Am. 
 We lift up Your name O Lord, 
 Worthy the Lamb who was slain, taking all our pain 
 We lift up Your name O Lord, 
 Giving You honor and praise, 
 With our hands upraised to You Lord. 
 Vamp: 
 Help me lift Jesus higher. 
 Help me lift Jesus higher and higher.

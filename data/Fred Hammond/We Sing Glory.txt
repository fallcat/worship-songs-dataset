Little baby boy sent as God among us 
 For Your plan to free all humanity 
 We sing glory to Your name 
 Sing glory to Your name 
 Tiny fragile heart, yeah 
 Pumped Your blood to save us 
 For You come to be a sin offering 
 Singing glory to the Lamb, yeah glory 
 Sing glory to the Lamb 
 Singing glory to the one 
 Who saved the whole world 
 Born to die but You live again 
 And take all our sins away 
 Little Your hands and feet, yeah 
 Made for nail and hammer 
 For the pain and grief you suffered for me 
 I sing glory to the Lamb 
 Oh, glory to the Lamb 
 Tiny arms and legs 
 Broad strong and sturdy

 We sing glory to Your name

 Born to die and then live again 
 To take all our sins away 
 Glory, glory to the one

 You died but You'll rise again 
 So, Jesus we praise Your name

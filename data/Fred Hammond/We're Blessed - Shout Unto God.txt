Since thou has walked uprightly 
 As a light in a dark land 
 Since thou has placed in thy heart 
 All the Lord's commands 
 He's set thee above all nations 
 And casting thine enemies away 
 He's standing up within thee 
 So let me hear you say 
 We're blessed in the city 
 We're blessed in the field 
 We're blessed when we come and when 
 We go 
 We cast down every stronghold 
 Sickness and poverty must cease 
 For the devil is defeated 
 We are blessed 
 Blessed, Blessed, Blessed, Blessed 
 Thou believe in God only 
 And put no confidence in man 
 And everything that does concern thee 
 You've placed it in His hand 
 Though a host rise up against thee 
 To try and spoil the day 
 They'll rush in one road to harm thee 
 But they'll flee in seven ways 
 We're blessed in the city 
 We're blessed in the field 
 We're blessed when we come and when 
 We go 
 We cast down every stronghold 
 Sickness and poverty must cease 
 For the devil is defeated 
 We are blessed 
 We know that God's word is clothed in truth 
 And righteousness 
 We are His children and with our hearts we 
 Do confess

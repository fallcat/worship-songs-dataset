We're blessed in the city 
 We're blessed in the field 
 We're blessed when we come and when we go 
 We cast down every stronghold 
 Sickness and poverty must cease 
 For the devil is defeated 
 We are blessed 
 Since thou hast walked uprightly, as a light in a dark land 
 Since thou hast placed in thine heart, all the lord's commands 
 He's set thee above nations, He's cast thine enemies away 
 He's standing up within thee, so let me hear you say 
 Thou believeth in GOD only, and put no confidence in man 
 Everything that does concern thee, you placed it in His hands 
 Though a host rise up against thee, to try and spoil the day 
 They'll rush in one road to harm thee, but they'll flee in seven ways 
 Vamp 
 We know that god's word is clothed in truth and righteousness 
 We are his children and with our hearts we do confess 
 Late in the midnight hour, God's gonna turn it around 
 It's gonna work in your favor 
 Late in the midnight hour, God's gonna turn it around, and around, and around, and around, and around

I've questioned but I 
 Still don't know the reason why 
 When trouble shook my ground 
 You stayed around 
 So faithful Your love has been to me 
 And Lord I'll always love You for the rest of my days 
 What can I give in exchange 
 For the love You've shown me everyday 
 My very life just don't seem like enough 
 But I'd rather give to You 
 And I'll throw in all my love 
 I'm so grateful that 
 Your love is available 
 It hears me when I call 
 And it lifts me when I'm low 
 Lord no other love 
 Is worthy to receive such praise 
 So I give You all of my life 
 And love You for the rest of my days 
 (Channel) 
 I'll waste no more time 
 'Cause there is no more doubt in my mind 
 For Your love means the world to me (Can't live without it, no Lord) 
 (There's no way) That I'd go another day 
 Without giving You all of me (Can't live without it) 
 For all Your love 
 (Repeat Chorus-Out)

You're the joy inside my tears 
 And my comfort through the pain 
 Your touch relieves my fears 
 When it's dry You send the rain 
 Channel: 
 You're constantly embracing me 
 With loving praise I gotta say 
 Lord I wanna thank You 
 For Your wondrous love 
 Has come down and touched my life 
 And for Your mercy and Your grace 
 We praise You morning, noon and night 
 Your compassion great upon my soul 
 You help, You lead and guide 
 Lord I wanna thank You 
 For Your wondrous love 
 Has come down and touched my life 
 Chorus B: 
 You're so beautiful, beautiful 
 Lord You know You're more than 
 Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful 
 So incredible, incredible, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 And I'm so in love with you. 
 When discouragement has come 
 Through the storm You help me sing 
 When the night says it has won 
 In the morning joy You bring 
 (Repeat Channel) (Repeat Chorus) (Repeat Chorus B) 
 Vamp: 
 When it gets down to it 
 You're all I have and all I need 
 All in my soul there's a praise for You 
 (Repeat) 
 There's a praise for You 
 When it gets down to it 
 When it gets down to it

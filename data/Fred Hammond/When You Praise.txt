When you praise, when you praise, 
 There should be a fire in your heart. 
 Hands up raised, when you praise, 
 Consuming every part because you know 
 The GOD we serve will make 
 His presence known, when you praise, 
 When you praise. 
 (2x) 
 When we think of how wonderful 
 And merciful and kind 
 Our GOD has been to us. 
 Then we know every glory hallelujah 
 He deserves, when we praise 
 (Back to chorus 1) 
 Praise will bind, confuse 
 And break the enemy. 
 And cause his hands to be still. 
 So we raise our hands in total victory 
 We know we triumph in his will. 
 (Woman sings chorus 1) 
 When we praise, when we praise, 
 There should be a fire in your heart. 
 Hands up raised when you praise, 
 Consuming every part because you know 
 (Chorus) the GOD we serve will make his presence known. 
 Oh, when we praise, when we praise, when we praise. 
 (Fred sings chorus 1) 
 Let us praise, let us praise 
 With fire in our heart 
 Hands up raised let us praise 
 Consuming every part because you know 
 The GOD we serve will make his presence known. 
 (Choir w/fred) 
 When we praise, when we praise, when we praise 
 When we praise, when we praise 
 There is none like you 
 When you praise, when we praise, when we praise 
 When we praise, when we praise 
 Our GOD is an awesome GOD yeah 
 When we praise, when we praise, when we praise 
 When we praise, when we praise 
 Bless the lord on my soul 
 (Repeat 1x) 
 You can put your hands together in here tonight if you want to

As your spirit is leading, I'm willing to follow 
 For you give peace like a river and a joy that overflows 
 Total chaos when I'm led by me, 
 So my mind is made up and I'm willing to follow You 
 Verse One: 
 What is it, Lord, that You need from me? 
 And in which direction should I move my feet? 
 Should I go left? Should I go right? 
 Or should I stay? (stay right here) 
 'Cause my own power I just can not count on 
 'Cause every time I try to, it gets me in trouble 
 Life gets so crazy when I do it all my way (yeah) 
 So I acknowledge You in all that I do 
 My own understanding I can never lean on 
 I know that my direction should come from You 
 'Cause it's to You that I belong 
 (Say it) 
 Verse Two: 
 I counted up the cost--it's more than fair 
 Even right down to the cross that I must bear 
 You gave Your life to me, So I'll give mine to You 
 Without Your power, I just could not make it 
 All of my life's struggle, wouldn't be able to take it (yeah) 
 My desire is to please You, that's what I do 
 So I acknowledge You in all that I do 
 My own understanding I can never lean on 
 I know that my direction, yes, it should come from You 
 'Cause it's to You that I belong 
 Vamp, repeating: 
 Lord I'm yielding, and it's to Your will 
 Do You want me to move forward? Or stand still? 
 To reveal your glory, honor is my passion 
 Lord, my heart is willing, willing to follow

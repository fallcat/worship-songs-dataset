I will live and not die 
 For every need there is supply 
 For the Savior says just ask 
 And believe that you receive 
 If you ask the impossible 
 Won't He do it somebody say? 
 Yes He will 
 Yes He will 
 Oh yes He will 
 From deep in debt to being free 
 If you need that mountain and the sea 
 If it seems too hard for you 
 Just believe that He wants to 
 Do what seems impossible for you right now 
 Just say 
 I believe He'll bless me 
 I believe He'll touch me 
 I believe He'll heal me 
 Oh yes He will 
 Believe only and do not doubt 
 If fear moves in evict it out 
 For the Lord response to faith 
 And He longs to save the day 
 And if you ask the impossible won't He do it? 
 I believe He'll bless me 
 I believe He'll touch me 
 I believe He'll heal me Oh 
 I believe He'll save me 
 I believe He'll keep me 
 I believe He'll hold me Oh 
 Our Father He loves to respond to our faith 
 It's His good pleasure 
 If I ask the impossible 
 Won't He do for me 
 I gotta believe one thing 
 That He will 
 That He will 
 Yes He will 
 Yes, yes

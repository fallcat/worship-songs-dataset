Fred Hammond - You Are My Daily Bread 
 You are, you are 
 Oh, oh lord you are 
 Oh lord, oh lord you are 
 (Say) oh lord, you are 
 You are my daily bread (you are) 
 You are my living well (never thirst again) 
 You are my present help 
 You are, you are 
 You are, you are 
 Every good and perfect thing, 
 Comes from you and now we bring, 
 All of our worship, so thankful for all... 
 All you are. 
 Lift up a song to you in praise, 
 And we will make mention of your name, 
 There is none like you, and we will 
 Always sing how glorious is your love, 
 How glorious, everybody say yeah...

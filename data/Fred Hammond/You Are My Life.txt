The evening now in sight 
 I earnestly contend 
 To just stay grounded 
 With the absence of the light 
 The enemy moves in 
 And I am surrounded 
 With a weary heart 
 The battle goes on 
 Lord I will rest in the Words 
 That You spoke to me 
 You are my Life 
 You are my strength 
 My faithful defense and My cover 
 My shield and shelter 
 Saviour and shepherd 
 You're my life and my strength 
 Jesus You are 
 The warfare rages on 
 The toll it takes is that 
 My heart is tender 
 My spirit yet is strong 
 But as usual my flesh 
 Wants to surrender 
 Though it's hard to wait 
 On your word I'll depend and believe with my heart 
 Until the end 
 In my distress I called on You 
 And from Your throne 
 You heard me and saved me 
 VAMP 
 You are X6 
 Oh, You are 
 Jesus You are my shield and shelter 
 Savior and shepherd 
 You're my life 
 Jesus You are 
 (Repeat vamp) 
 You are my life 
 You are my strength 
 You are my life 
 You are my strength (OUT)

Bread of life sent down from glory 
 Many things you were on earth 
 A Holy King, a carpenter 
 You are the Living Word 
 Bread of Heaven sent down from glory 
 Many things you were on earth 
 A Holy King, a carpenter 
 You are the Living Word (2x) 
 Awesome ruler, gentle Redeemer 
 God with us, the Living Truth 
 And what a friend we have in you 
 You are the Living Word (2x) 
 (But when we put it all together this is what we like to call You...) 
 Jesus, Jesus! That's what we call you 
 Manger born, but on a tree 
 You died to save humanity 
 You are the Living Word (4x) 
 Oh oh oh 
 You are the Living Word (3x) 
 Jesus, Jesus! That's what we call You 
 Jesus, Jesus Oh, oh 
 You are the Living Word (3x then fade)

Perfect and true 
 Pure in all your ways 
 O Lord, there is none else like you, no one like you 
 And all these things keep me in awe of you 
 For I'm overwhelmed that you would call me friend 
 What is a man that thou art mindful of him? 
 Could an awesome God find common ground within? 
 Just to know that you delight to be with me 
 Fills my heart, with so much joy 
 VERSE 2 (Solo) 
 Ruler of everything 
 You are creator, Lord and King 
 Willing you have taken my debt as your own 
 I would gladly give all to be a servant or a slave 
 For I'm overwhelmed that you would call me friend

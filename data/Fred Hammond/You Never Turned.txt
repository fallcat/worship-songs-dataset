You never turned, you'll never turned your back on me 
 There were so many times you could have walked away 
 Could have thrown up both your hands, said you weren't gonna stay 
 But you were always there for me, you stood right through it all 
 Your love was always lifting me each and every time I'd fall 
 When I think about your love, when I think about your grace 
 You know my heart gets overwhelmed, tears wash my face 
 And all the times I got it wrong and I really let you down 
 You said you'd stay no matter what, you'd always be around 
 Can I say it again and let the world know how much I love you? 
 Your back on me, lord, I can count on you 
 Not gonna leave me or forsake me (you were right there) 
 In your word that's what you promised me (you were right there) 
 When my heart was down and lonely (you were right there) 
 You were there, you were there (you were right there) 
 In the battle you are with me (you were right there) 
 Always there to give the victory (you were right there) 
 You were there (you were right there) with me 
 I would be so lost, lord without you (I'm lost without you) 
 You never left me, that's one thing I can count on 
 When my friends was gone (you stayed) they left me all alone (you stayed) 
 If I messed it up (you stayed), when I got it wrong (you stayed) 
 In my darkest night (you stayed) 
 When I said my last goodbye (you stayed) 
 You were right there (you stayed), you were right there (you stayed) 
 You stayed by my side (you stayed), and I don't know 
 I don't know why (you stayed) really blessing me (you stayed) 
 When I think about your love 
 I'm so glad you stayed (you stayed) Jesus, I'm so glad you stayed (you stayed) 
 My heart gets overwhelmed (you stayed) and I got to lift my hands (you stayed) 
 You you you you you you you you you you you you you you stayed

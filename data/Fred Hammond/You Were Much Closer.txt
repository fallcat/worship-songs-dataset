You were much closer 
 No need to fear 
 I can hear your word say 
 And my eyes filled with tears 
 Because you felt far away 
 So I returned to our place 
 And to my surprise 
 You were much closer, than I realize 
 Sometimes it's hard, I must agree 
 When I depend on, someone like me 
 I just end up abused, and in need of care 
 But lord I call, I call to you lord, and you're always right there 
 Sometimes my fears are hard to miss 
 (Anybody know what I' talking about) 
 Because my storms, they don't wanna pass 
 So when my mind feels confused, and my heart starts to stray 
 I call upon, the name of the lord 
 And I'll hear him say, there is no no 
 There is no need to fear 
 (I can hear Jesus say) 
 I can hear Jesus say yeah 
 (But my eyes filled up with tears because you felt) 
 So far away 
 (So I) 
 So I returned to our place 
 (Returned to our place) 
 And to my surprise 
 (You were standing right there) 
 You were much closer, than I realize 
 (And you are author of the word and I saw you were closer) 
 Closer, you were much close 
 It took all this time to realize, you were standing right by my side 
 Closer, you were much close 
 You were much closer, than I realize 
 (x2) 
 Closer, you were much close 
 (When I thought I was going down for the last time my father), you were standing right by my side 
 Closer 
 You were much closer, than I realize 
 You were much closer, than I realize (x3)

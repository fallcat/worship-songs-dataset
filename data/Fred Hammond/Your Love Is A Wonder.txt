(Verse 1A) 
 For all the love 
 You give to us 
 When we lie down 
 When we wake up 
 It's like the sun 
 So nice and warm 
 A shelter strong 
 In times of storm 
 (Verse 1B) 
 Without Your love 
 Our lives would be 
 A never ending tragedy 
 So now we take this time to say 
 We love You Lord 
 In every way 
 (Channel) 
 (I'm so thankful) For Your love 
 (I'm so grateful for) Your love 
 (If it wasn't) For Your love 
 (Where would we be) Your love reached out for my life 
 And lifted me 
 I know for sure 
 It's what I need, Yeah 
 (Chorus A) 
 Your love is a wonder 
 Your love is a wonderful thing yeah 
 (Repeat Verse 1A/B & Channel 1x) 
 (Repeat Verse 1B and Channel 1x) 
 (Chorus B) 
 Your love is a wonder 
 Your love is a wonderful thing yeah 
 Your love is a wonder 
 Your love is a wonderful thing yeah 
 (Vamp) 
 Your love is a wonder 
 Your love is a wonder 
 Your love is a wonder 
 Your love is a wonderful thing 
 I need it 
 I can't live 
 Without it 
 I need it 
 Your love is a wonder 
 Your love is a wonderful thing

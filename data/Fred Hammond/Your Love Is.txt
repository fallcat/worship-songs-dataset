Beyond what I can think 
 You go beyond my hopes and highest expectations 
 The love You've shown on Calvary 
 Forever, always 
 Pursuing me 
 Relentlessly 
 I'm crying please 
 Open up the heavens (Open up the heavens) 
 Let me feel Your shower (Let me feel Your shower) 
 The shower of Your presence 
 Every moment of each hour 
 Lord here's my hand (Lord here's my hand) 
 Cover me and (Cover me and) 
 Take me beyond 
 What I understand 
 Your love is greater than my thoughts-deeper, higher 
 Brighter than my hopes-burns like fire 
 Lighting up my soul-You inspire 
 Your love is always 
 Always moving me to tears-overflowing 
 Just like a waterfall-keeps on going 
 The wonderful thing about Your love-keeps me knowing 
 (Repeat Pre-Chorus 1x) 
 Your love is greater than my thoughts-deeper, higher 
 Brighter than my hopes-burns like fire 
 Lighting up my soul-You inspire 
 Your love is always 
 Always moving me to tears-overflowing 
 Just like a waterfall-keeps on going 
 The wonderful thing about Your love-keeps me knowing 
 (Pre-Vamp) 
 It's renewing and refreshing (That's what Your love is) 
 Vital and life-giving (That's what Your love is) 
 Comforting and blessing (That's what Your love, that's what Your love, that's what Your love) 
 A place where I can run to (That's what Your love is) 
 A tower and a shelter (That's what Your love is) 
 Forgiving us forever (That's what Your love, that's what Your love) 
 That's what Your love is, Your love is 
 (Vamp A) 
 Renewing and refreshing 
 Vital and life-giving 
 Comforting and blessing 
 That's what Your love is 
 A place where I can run to 
 A tower and a shelter 
 Forgiving us forever 
 That's what I'm talking 'bout 
 (Repeat Vamp A 1x) 
 (Vamp B) 
 Whenever I feel Your love on me 
 The tears begin to flow 
 I let myself go 
 And then I know 
 Your love is here, Your love, oh Lord 
 Whenever I feel Your warm embrace 
 Like the warm sun on my face 
 Your presence in this place 
 It lets me know Your love is here, Your love

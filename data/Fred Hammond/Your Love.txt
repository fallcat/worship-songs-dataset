It goes beyond all knowledge (your love) 
 Anything I've ever known (your love) 
 Bearing what I never could (your love) 
 Paid what I owed (your love) 
 Covering my darkest side (your love) 
 Unconditional it remains (your love) 
 Forever it purifies (your love) 
 They say that love is given to' 
 The more we know about each other the more love we exchange 
 But how can this be? 
 Cause before I knew who you are 
 You were loving me 
 And a love like this is so hard to describe. 
 I know the story of the gift you gave to man 
 And as we walk together 
 I would never understand 
 It would take a million lifetimes 
 To perceive the love that you have for my life 
 A love like this is really hard to describe 
 What kind 
 What kind of love is this? 
 Beyond anything I've known 
 No other love, no other love 
 No other.

Your Name is Jesus 
 Fred Hammond- Somethin' About Love 
 2004 
 A precious name 
 I love to call 
 It stands alone 
 And above all 
 The name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 At the mention of your name 
 Every Circumstance must change 
 I can always count on you 
 To bring healing to my pain 
 Your very life 
 For me you gave 
 To wash my sins 
 And my life saved 
 Your name is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 What a sacrifice of love 
 You are faithful, you are true 
 So your cross belongs to me 
 And my heart belongs to You 
 I'll tell the world 
 That you still live 
 You want to love, heal and forgive 
 Your name is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 For the wounds you have received 
 Made a way for all to come 
 No matter what your past has been 
 He won't remember what you've done 
 What a sacrifice of love 
 You are faithful you are true 
 So your cross belongs to me 
 And my heart belongs to you 
 (Cause there is) 
 There is no other name, there is no other love 
 No one else can compare to you 
 No one. 
 Oh'. how I love him, Oh' how I need him. 
 Can't live without him

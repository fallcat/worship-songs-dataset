When you've been called 
 To have a realationship with God 
 When you've been called to do something great for him 
 Sometimes 
 Young people hear me 
 It's not gone be easy 
 It's gone be down right hard sometimes 
 Down right difficult 
 But the word of the lord 
 Just simply declares one thing 
 Every step of a righteous man 
 Is ordered by God 
 Ordered 
 Though you may not know his mind 
 He will reveal it all in time 
 Just know till then 
 Your steps are ordered by God 
 When it seems like my mountains to high 
 And I'm tired of the climb 
 When it feels like my patience is frustrated with time 
 I depend on the spirit 
 To gently remind 
 When my faith is challenged 
 And my vision is obscured 
 When I'm hanging on by a thread 
 And my footings unsure 
 I look to the spirit 
 For one word to help me endure 
 And that word is ordered 
 Vamp 
 Ordered, Ordered, Ordered 
 Before the world was framed 
 Ordered, Ordered, Ordered 
 Before the whole world was framed 
 Ordered, Ordered, Ordered 
 Before the whole world was framed 
 Through the fire 
 Through the flood 
 When life takes you through winding turns 
 Ordered, Ordered, Ordered

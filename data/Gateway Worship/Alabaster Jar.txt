This alabaster jar is all I have of worth 
 I break it at Your feet, Lord, it's less than You deserve 
 You're far more beautiful, more precious than the oil 
 The sum of my desires and the fullness of my joy 
 Like You spilled Your blood, I spill my heart 
 As an offering to my King 
 Here I am, take me as an offering 
 Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory, take me 
 This time that I have left is all I have of worth 
 I lay it at Your feet, Lord, it's less than You deserve 
 And though I've little strength, and though my days are few 
 You gave Your life for me so I will live my life for You 
 Like You spilled Your blood, I spill my heart 
 As an offering to my King 
 Here I am, take me as an offering 
 Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory 
 Here I am, take me as an offering 
 Here I am, giving every heartbeat for Your glory, take me 
 Worthy, worthy, You are worthy, worthy is the Lord 
 Worthy, worthy, You are worthy, worthy is the Lord

I worship You alone in the quiet place 
 Where the stillness of my soul 
 Meets the brilliance of Your face 
 My heart is bound to You 
 With a bond as thick as blood 
 I've struggled in my strength 
 To break through sin's chains 
 But You did it with Your love 
 My heart is bound to You deep calls unto deep 
 I'm staggered by Your love's sheer intensity 
 As its waves break over me 
 My heart is bound to You deep calls unto deep 
 Encircled in Your strength 
 Caught up in Your grace enfolded in Your arms

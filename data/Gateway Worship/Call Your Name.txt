My Friend, my King 
 You see the waves surrounding me 
 I'll fix my eyes upon You 
 And though my sorrows roll 
 Like thunder through my soul 
 I'll set my heart upon You 
 Call Your name 
 I believe that You hear me 
 You're near me 
 Sorrows fly, shadows flee 
 At Your coming You can do anything 
 When I call Your name 
 Then come what may 
 I know Your blood will make a way 
 I'll throw my arms around You 
 Call Your name 
 I believe that You hear me 
 You're near me 
 Sorrows fly, shadows flee 
 At Your coming You can do anything 
 When I call Your name 
 When I call 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Call Your name 
 I believe that You hear me 
 You're near me 
 Sorrows fly, shadows flee 
 At Your coming You can do anything 
 When I call Your name

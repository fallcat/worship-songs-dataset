If I call, will You come 
 When I cry, do You hear 
 I believe every tear 
 Is caught up by a faithful God 
 So I will cry until You come 
 Cast my cares into Your arms 
 I can't see past this storm 
 But I'm counting on a faithful God 
 Faithful God 
 You hold my life secure 
 All my days are Yours 
 I believe 
 My God is like a fire defending me 
 Faithfully 
 I believe You still heal 
 And demons still bow 
 I'm convinced there is power 
 In trusting in a faithful God 
 So I will praise till You appear 
 And set Your foot upon this shore 
 I declare that every foe 
 Is subject to my faithful God 
 I know that You are mine 
 And I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I know Your faithfulness 
 It will endure, it will endure

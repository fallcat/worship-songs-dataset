Who is this King of glory 
 Beautiful and matchless one 
 Who is this King so holy 
 Every knee will bow at His throne 
 Jesus, the Lamb of God 
 Savior and King 
 You alone are worthy of our praise forever 
 You alone are seated on the throne of Heaven 
 Glorify, glorify, You alone 
 Who is this King of mercy 
 Wonderful and full of grace 
 Who is this King so worthy 
 Nations fear and kingdoms praise 
 You are the King that saves us 
 Powerful and full of love 
 You are the King that gave us 
 Life with every drop of Your blood

You saved my life from death 
 When I was all defeated 
 You spoke Your promises 
 And brought life to my weakness 
 Came as a conquering King 
 And You warred for my freedom 
 My soul can't help but sing 
 Hallelujah 
 You opened up my eyes 
 For the first time I saw You 
 Your love commanding life 
 And deserving devotion 
 You told me who I am 
 Now in faith I believe it 
 My soul can't help but sing 
 Hallelujah 
 You've made a place for me 
 Silenced all my accusers 
 Leading me forth with peace 
 Filled with joy I will follow 
 Your cross demands my life 
 Now Your grace is my anthem 
 My soul can't help but sing 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, we're redeemed and made free 
 By the blood of the Lamb We have won 
 Hallelujah, we will sing victory 
 Jesus conquered the grave 
 God be praised

You awaken my heart from slumbering 
 Meet me in mourning, and You speak to my grief 
 You're the light in my darkness, the delight of my eyes 
 The hope of the daybreak when the sun's slow to rise 
 I trust that every moment's in Your hands 
 You're the God of my days 
 The King of my nights 
 Lord of my laughter 
 Sovereign in sorrow 
 You're the Prince of my praise 
 The love of my life 
 You never leave me 
 You are faithful 
 God of my days 
 You unveil my eyes, help me to see 
 The arms of my Father encircling me 
 You're a constant companion, I am never alone 
 Your love is the banner that's leading me home 
 I trust that every moment's in Your hands 
 You're the God of my days 
 The King of my nights 
 Lord of my laughter 
 Sovereign in sorrow 
 You're the Prince of my praise 
 The love of my life 
 You never leave me 
 You are faithful 
 God of my days 
 My eyes are on You 
 My hope is in You 
 My faith is in You 
 My eyes are on You 
 My hope is in You 
 My faith is in You 
 God of my days 
 The King of my nights 
 Lord of my laughter 
 Sovereign in sorrow 
 You're the Prince of my praise 
 The love of my life 
 You never leave me 
 You are faithful 
 God of my days 
 God of my days 
 God of my days

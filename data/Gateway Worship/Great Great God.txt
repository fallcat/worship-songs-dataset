We trust You, God 
 Your cross gave life, hope and salvation 
 Full restoration, promise for all 
 Your grace has made us part of Your kingdom 
 Living in freedom as heirs with Your son 
 Jesus, Your name is a light 
 Now Your redemption draws in to our lives 
 Strong in battle, You overcame 
 And the victory's ours, now we sing 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Our walls fall down, strongholds are broken 
 Eternity's spoken, righteous we stand 
 The church we'll rise, declaring Your kingdom 
 Shouting Your freedom, the blood of the lamb 
 Jesus, Your name is a light 
 Now Your redemption draws in to our lives 
 Strong in battle, You overcame 
 And the victory's ours, now we sing 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 Great, great, there is no one like our God 
 You reign in all the earth 
 You reign victorious 
 Your power is limitless 
 There is no one like our God 
 You reign, You reign in all the earth 
 You reign victorious 
 Your power is limitless 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like our God

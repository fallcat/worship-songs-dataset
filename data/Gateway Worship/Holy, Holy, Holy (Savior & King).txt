Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God almighty 
 Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful and mighty 
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, all the saints adore Thee 
 Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea 
 Cherubim and Seraphim falling down before Thee 
 Which wert and art and evermore shall be 
 You are Lord, You are Lord 
 You reign eternally 
 You are Lord God Almighty 
 My Savior and my King

 You reign eternally

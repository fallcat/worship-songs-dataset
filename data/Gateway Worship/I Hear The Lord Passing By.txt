I hear the Lord passing by 
 This could be my day of visitation 
 Have mercy on me, Lord 
 Hear my cry of desperation 
 I hear the Lord passing by 
 My heart, my flesh 
 Yearn to be with You 
 Open my eyes to see Your glory 
 All the days of my life 
 This is my one chance 
 This is my moment 
 Lord, I throw everything aside 
 Just to run blindly after You 
 This is my one chance 
 This is my moment 
 I wanna see You 
 I wanna touch You 
 I wanna hold You 
 I wanna know You 
 I wanna follow You 
 I wanna follow You 
 All my hope is in You 
 All I need is in You 
 My miracle is You 
 I hear the Lord passing by 
 This could be my day of visitation 
 Have mercy on me, Lord 
 Hear my cry of desperation 
 Have mercy on me, Lord 
 From the depth of my affliction 
 I hear the Lord 
 I hear the Lord 
 I hear the Lord passing by

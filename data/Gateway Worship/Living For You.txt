This is the day, the hour, the time I give it all away to You 
 I wanna say I'll go Your way, living my life for something real 
 I can't survive, I can't go on if I'm without You by my side 
 I wanna spend eternity with You 
 You've turned my world upside down 
 My life is spinning 'round You now, all of me, all for You 
 I'll let my light shine for You 
 Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'm living for You 
 You've turned my world upside down 
 My life is spinning 'round You now, all of me, all for You 
 I'll let my light shine for You 
 Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'm living for 
 You've turned my world upside down 
 My life is spinning 'round You now, all of me, all for You 
 I'll let my light shine for You 
 Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'm living for You

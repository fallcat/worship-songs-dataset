Who could crucify a king? 
 Who could hurt the hands that heal? 
 What could motivate such things? 
 Love has done it 
 How'd this mercy come to me, and blood become my covering? 
 I do not deserve these things 
 Love has done it 
 So I... 
 Lift the God whose love delivered me 
 Magnify Christ the coming King 
 Glorify the Lord who lifted me with His great love 
 Who cast my accuser down and trampled on my enemy? 
 Ransacked hell and took its keys? 
 Love has done it 
 So I... 
 Lift the God whose love delivered me 
 Magnify Christ the coming King 
 Glorify the Lord who lifted me with His great love 
 Lift the God whose love delivered me 
 I magnify the Christ of the redeemed 
 Glorify the God who rescued me with His great love 
 Arise and shine 
 Rest Your glory here 
 Arise and shine 
 Rest Your glory here

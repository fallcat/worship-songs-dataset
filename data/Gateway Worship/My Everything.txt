Rendered speechless by Your beauty 
 Lord, I'm blown away 
 With everything that's in my heart 
 A million words could never say 
 All there is to say 
 You're more than just a song 
 You're more than just a whim 
 You're more than just a passing fantasy 
 You're my every day 
 You're my every way 
 You're my everything 
 If I could see forever 
 In just one moment I would say 
 These today's are worth tomorrow 
 When I will see You face to face 
 I wanna be with You 
 I need to be with You 
 I long to be with You, precious King 
 So with every day 
 Lord, in every way 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Lord, You're my everything 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I breathe 
 You are my refuge 
 And my strength 
 You're my everything 
 You're my every day 
 You're my every way 
 You're my everything 
 You're my every day 
 You're my every way 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything

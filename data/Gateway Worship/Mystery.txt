God eternal here today 
 Moving in unchanging ways 
 Far beyond the highest height 
 Closer than can be defined 
 You're a mystery 
 Common human clothed in splendor 
 Unending strength yet heart so tender 
 Born to die to free the slave 
 The beauty of amazing grace 
 Is a mystery 
 I see you move in unseen ways 
 Hear your voice in quiet place 
 I feel your peace steal my breath away 
 You're simply a mystery 
 So unlovely, still you love me 
 Needing you, yet you pursue me 
 Loving me since time began 
 Such love I'll never comprehend 
 To me that greatest mystery 
 Is You in love with me

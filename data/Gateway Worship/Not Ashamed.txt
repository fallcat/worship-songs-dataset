Saved by grace we found in You, we love to tell our story 
 How You made our lives brand new, following You only 
 We are walking in Your truth, living for Your glory 
 Now we resonate with You 
 We will stand as one for the King of the world 
 Let salvation come, salvation come 
 Real love has changed us, real hope invade us 
 You illuminate us 
 We've got a world to change, they gotta hear His Name 
 Real life is freedom, so now with freedom we will run 
 We will be a witness, real love, real life we'll illuminate

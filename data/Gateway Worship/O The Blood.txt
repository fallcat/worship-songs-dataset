O the blood 
 Crimson love 
 Price of life's demand 
 Shameful sin 
 Placed on Him 
 The Hope of every man 
 O the blood of Jesus washes me 
 O the blood of Jesus shed for me 
 What a sacrifice that saved my life 
 Yes, the blood, it is my victory 
 Savior Son 
 Holy One 
 Slain so I can live 
 See the Lamb 
 The great I Am 
 Who takes away my sin 
 O the blood of Jesus washes me 
 O the blood of Jesus shed for me 
 What a sacrifice that saved my life 
 Yes, the blood, it is my victory 
 O the blood of the Lamb 
 O the blood of the Lamb 
 O the blood of the Lamb 
 The precious blood of the Lamb 
 What a sacrifice 
 That saved my life 
 Yes, the blood, it is my victory 
 O what love 
 No greater love 
 Grace, how can it be 
 That in my sin 
 Yes, even then 
 He shed His blood for me 
 O the blood of Jesus washes me 
 O the blood of Jesus shed for me 
 What a sacrifice that saved my life 
 Yes, the blood, it is my victory 
 It was a sacrifice that saved my life 
 Yes, the blood, it is my victory

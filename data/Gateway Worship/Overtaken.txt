Jesus Christ, I worship and adore You 
 Every day I live I'm living for You 
 What else can I say, You've overtaken me 
 Every day with You is getting better 
 Every word from You is like a treasure 
 Giving all of me and finding more of You 
 God, You're taking over all of me, I'm letting go so 
 You can come and have Your way in me 
 I leave it all behind me 'cause Jesus saved my life 
 Now every day I worship You, my King 
 Jesus Christ, I thank You for the love You've 
 Given me, though I deserve nothing 
 Everything I have, I owe it all to You 
 Nothing that this world has got to offer 
 Satisfies my soul, I still hunger 
 Pouring out my heart, I'm filling up with You 
 God, You're taking over all of me, I'm letting go so 
 You can come and have Your way in me 
 I leave it all behind me 'cause Jesus saved my life 
 Now every day I worship You, my King 
 God, You're taking over all of me, I'm letting go so 
 You can come and have Your way in me 
 I leave it all behind me 'cause Jesus saved my life 
 Now every day I worship You, my King 
 Jesus Christ, I worship and adore You 
 Every day I live I'm living for You 
 What else can I say, You've overtaken me 
 God, You're taking over all of me, I'm letting go so 
 You can come and have Your way in me 
 I leave it all behind me 'cause Jesus saved my life 
 Now every day I worship You, my King

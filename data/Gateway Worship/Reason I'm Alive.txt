I used to be lost, but now I'm found in You 
 You showed me real love, and now I live for You 
 I wanna follow for all my days 
 I wanna live for the Creator of all the world 
 I am nothing without You, I'm breathing in with You 
 You are my source of life 
 I am saying I love You for everything You do 
 You are the reason I'm alive 
 It used to be dark, but now Your light shines through 
 You're always with me, You never let me go 
 I'm completely amazed by You 
 And I'm never gonna be the same 
 I am nothing without You, I'm breathing in with You 
 You are my source of life 
 I am saying I love You for everything You do 
 You are the reason I'm alive 
 You've been so good to me 
 You're every- thing I dreamed, now I'm complete 
 My friend when my world crashes down 
 And now I know I'll never be, never gonna be alone 
 I am nothing without You, I'm breathing in with You 
 You are my source of life 
 I am saying I love You for everything You do 
 You are the reason I'm alive 
 I am nothing without You, I'm breathing in with You 
 You are my source of life 
 I am saying I love You for everything You do 
 You are the reason I'm alive

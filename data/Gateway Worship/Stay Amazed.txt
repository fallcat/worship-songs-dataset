You are enthroned above the heaven 
 The earth and all creation bow before You 
 You are crowned with strength and glory 
 The angels crying holy, all surround You 
 Forever You will stand 
 Your kingdom has no end 
 O Holy God, I stay amazed 
 You are so much more than words could ever say 
 O Holy God, I pour out my praise 
 On the One who never ceases to amaze 
 You are loving beyond measure 
 Your presence is the treasure I am seeking 
 You are the all-consuming fire 
 I am Your desire and You are mine 
 I'm pouring out my praise on You 
 I'm pouring out my love on You

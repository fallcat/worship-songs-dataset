I found a love that never lets me go 
 I found a joy deeper than what I've known 
 I found a place for my soul to rest 
 And leave my burden and lose myself 
 You are the shelter from the pouring rain 
 You are the freedom to begin again 
 You are the hope that will see me through 
 I leave my all and run to You 
 You are my sun and shield, beyond what I can feel 
 I put my trust in who You are 
 You are the strength in me, beyond what I can see 
 I put my trust in who You are 
 I will trust You, I will trust You 
 I will trust You, I Will trust You

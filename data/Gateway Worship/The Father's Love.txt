No greater love have we known 
 We sing, we sing 
 The deph of the grace You have shown 
 We sing, we sing 
 Forever we live to proclaim 
 We found love in the arms of a Savior 
 Hope has come death has been defeated 
 We are one 
 Nothing can separate us from 
 The Father's love 
 You dwell inside of our praise 
 We sing, we sing 
 To tell os Your life and Your name 
 We sing, we sing 
 You came and gave us Your only Son 
 Through the cross Your work was done 
 Oh I believe 
 Your blood has washed away our sins 
 You gave us live and hope again 
 Oh I believe

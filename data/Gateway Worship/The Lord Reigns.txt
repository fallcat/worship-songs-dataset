The Lord reigns, let the people shout 
 He reigns in righteousness 
 Let the heavens be glad, let the earth rejoice 
 The Lord reigns, let the people clap their hands 
 Angels shout, the redeemed have come to dance 
 To celebrate, to celebrate He reigns 
 The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns 
 The Lord reigns, we will sing and shout 
 You reign, You reign 
 You reign, forever King of all 
 Let all the people sing of 
 Your awesome power in all the earth 
 Let darkness tremble at Your Name 
 Why do the nations rage when the King is on His throne? 
 Now and forever You will reign 
 The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns 
 The Lord reigns, we will sing and shout 
 You reign, You reign 
 You reign, forever King of all 
 The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns 
 The Lord reigns, we will sing and shout 
 You reign, You reign 
 You reign, forever King of all 
 Forever King of all 
 Forever King of all

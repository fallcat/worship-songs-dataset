Nations rise and nations fall, but God is the Lord above them all 
 Reign Jesus reign 
 Kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of the risen Son 
 Reign Jesus reign 
 We're declaring that Your Kingdom has come 
 We're declaring that Your Kingdom is here 
 The whole earth is filled with Your glory 
 The heavens declaring Your praise 
 The nations are filled with Your wonder 
 Holy are You Lord, Holy are You Lord 
 God of glory, God of might send out Your truth and light 
 Shine Jesus Shine 
 As the waters fill the sea, so let Your glory be 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Holy, Holy all the nations rise singing 
 There is no one like You, there Is none beside You 
 All of creation falling down when they see Your face 
 Holy are You Lord, Holy are You Lord

We face the trials this world will wage 
 We pray for strength, to stand in faith 
 Through it all our God remains 
 We walk through sickness, hurt and pain 
 We pray for healing in Your name 
 Through it all our God remains 
 Victorious, victorious 
 Jesus conquered the grave 
 And now He's alive inside of us 
 We face the darkness, brave the fight 
 We stand with those who give their life 
 Through it all our King will reign 
 We walk through sorrow, grief and loss 
 We see Your word turn weak to strong 
 Through it all our King will reign 
 Victorious, victorious 
 Jesus conquered the grave 
 And now He's alive inside of us 
 Victorious, victorious 
 We will stand for our King 
 The Savior who reigns 
 With Jesus we are victorious 
 You faced the trials, You chose the cross 
 Defeating death, You saved the lost 
 And now we raise Your victory song 
 Victorious, victorious 
 Jesus conquered the grave 
 And now He's alive inside of us 
 Victorious, victorious 
 We will stand for our King 
 The Savior who reigns 
 With Jesus we are victorious

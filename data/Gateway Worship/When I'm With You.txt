I was made for loving You 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to give You praise 
 All of my days, oh Lord 
 My all is for You 
 My all is for You 
 I was made for loving You 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to give You praise 
 All of my days, oh Lord 
 My all is for You 
 My all is for You 
 'Cause when I'm with You 
 My heart is satisfied 
 When I'm with You 
 My spirit can fly 
 When I'm with You 
 All the cares of my life fade away 
 Till all I want 
 Till all I see is You 
 'Cause when I'm with You 
 My heart is satisfied 
 When I'm with You 
 My spirit can fly 
 When I'm with You 
 All the cares of my life fade away 
 Till all I want 
 Till all I see is You 
 My God, my God, my God 
 You're all I want, Lord 
 Everything I want, all I want, Lord 
 Till all I want is You, oh Jesus 
 Till all I see is You 
 Till all I want is You 
 My God, my God 
 Till all I see is You 
 You're all, You're all everything I need 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 Till all I want is You, Jesus 
 Till all I see is You 
 Till all I want is You, oh Lord 
 Till all I see is You

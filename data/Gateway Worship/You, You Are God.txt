Here I am, I've come to find You 
 Here I am, to see Your grace 
 To bring to You an offering 
 I have to ask myself one thing 
 How can I do anything but praise, I praise 
 You, You are God, You are Lord 
 You are all I'm living for 
 You are King of everything 
 I want my life to praise You 
 Here I am, I've come to thank You 
 Here I am, a life You've changed 
 Because You gave Your life for me 
 You crucified Your Son for me 
 How can I do anything but praise, I praise 
 You, You are God, You are Lord 
 You are all I'm living for 
 You are King of everything 
 I want my life to praise You 
 You are God, You are Lord 
 You are all I'm living for 
 You are King of everything 
 I want my life to praise You 
 You, You are God, You are Lord 
 You are all I'm living for 
 You are King of everything 
 I want my life to praise You 
 You are God, You are Lord 
 You are all I'm living for 
 You are King of everything 
 I want my life to praise You 
 I want my life to praise You 
 I want my life to praise You

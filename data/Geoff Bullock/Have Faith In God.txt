Oh Lord you lead me 
 By the still waters 
 Quietly restoring my soul 
 You speak words of wisdom 
 The promise of glory 
 The power of the presence of God 
 Have faith in God 
 Let your hope rest on 
 The faith He has placed in your heart 
 Never give up 
 Never let go of the 
 Faith He has placed in your heart 
 Oh Lord You guide me 
 Through all the darkness 
 Turning my night into day 
 You'll never leave me 
 Never forsake me 
 The power of the presence of God

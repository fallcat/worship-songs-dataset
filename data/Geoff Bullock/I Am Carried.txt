Day by day and h our by hour Y our l ove for me from Heaven flows 
 Like streams of w ater in the de sert living waters flow 
 You walk beside me gently guiding leading me through every storm 
 Everlast ing, never chang ing grace and love divin e 
 Mercy's healing grace relieving every spot and ev'ry stain 
 Forgiven freely no more guilty love has conquered shame 
 The broken mended night has ended the lost and lonely lost no more 
 For I am carried in the arms of grace and love divine 
 I am carried in t he arms of grace and love divin e 
 I am held by hands of healing washed by water p ure 
 Lifting up my heav y heart held in grace scarred hands 
 I am carried in t he arms of grace and love divi ne 
 Never worthy never earning all my works now left behind 
 Ever onwards ever upwards You've called me on to rise 
 Above my darkness all my failure every fear and every pain 
 Always carried always covered by grace and love divine 
 I am carried in t he arms of grace and love divin e 
 I am held by hands of healing washed by water p ure 
 Lifting up my heav y heart held in grace scarred hands 
 I am carried in t he arms of grace and love divi ne

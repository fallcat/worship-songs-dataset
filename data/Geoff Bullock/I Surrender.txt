You're softening my heart 
 To the knowledge of Your love 
 And opening my eyes 
 You light the way 
 To love You 
 Words alone cannot express 
 All the hope that You have placed 
 Within me 
 In between each heartbeat, Lord 
 I surrender 
 I surrender to You 
 I surrender to You 
 Everything I am and ever hope to be 
 I surrender to You 
 You gently pick me up 
 Wash me with your love 
 And opening my ears 
 You speak the Word 
 Healing 
 Releasing all the hurts and fears 
 By the hope that You have placed 
 Within me 
 In between each heartbeat, Lord 
 I surrender 
 I surrender to You 
 I surrender to You 
 Everything I am and ever hope to be 
 I surrender to You

I Will behold the majesty of God 
 The risen Prince of Peace 
 Son of righteousness 
 You suffered for my sins 
 With stripes You brought me healing 
 In death You brought me life 
 This life I now receive 
 For You alone are worthy 
 And You have overcome 
 Death has been defeated 
 Righteousness has won 
 Creation bows before YOU 
 All-heaven shouts Your name 
 And I bow down and worship You 
 I will partake of the righteousness of God 
 Redemption through Your blood 
 Forgiveness of my sins 
 The riches of Your grace 
 In wisdoms understanding 
 The mystery of Your Will 
 In Christ we see fulfilled 
 For You alone are worthy 
 And You have overcome 
 Death has been defeated 
 Righteousness has won 
 Creation bows before YOU 
 All-heaven shouts Your name 
 And I bow down and worship You 
 I will behold the beauty of the Lord 
 My eyes will surely see 
 My ears will clearly hear 
 The trumpet call of God 
 The Voice of the Archangel 
 The glory of the Lord 
 The risen lamb Of God 
 For You alone are worthy 
 And You have overcome 
 Death has been defeated 
 Righteousness has won 
 Creation bows before YOU 
 All-heaven shouts Your name 
 And I bow down and worship You

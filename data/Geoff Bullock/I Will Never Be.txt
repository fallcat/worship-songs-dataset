I will never be the same again 
 I can never return, I've closed the door 
 I will walk the path, I'll run the race 
 And I will never be the same again 
 (Repeat) 
 Fall like fire, soak like rain 
 Flow like mighty waters, again and again 
 Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff 
 And let a flame burn, to glorify Your name 
 There are higher heights 
 There are deeper seas 
 Whatever You need to do, Lord, do it in me 
 The glory of God, fills my life 
 And I will never be the same again

I'm your child 
 I give my life to you 
 Wholly available 
 Faithful and true 
 And in my life 
 Let your light be seen 
 So that the world may know 
 I am your child 
 Take me Lord 
 I am your child 
 Send me Lord 
 Set my heart on fire 
 Take me Lord 
 I am your child 
 Send me Lord 
 Set my heart on fire. 
 I'll take this time 
 Lord to say I love you 
 I'll take this time 
 To bow before your throne

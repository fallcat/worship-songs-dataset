Just let me say how much I love You 
 Let me speak of Your mercy and grace 
 Just let me live in the shadow of Your beauty 
 Let me see You face to face 
 And the earth will shake as Your Word goes forth 
 And the heavens can tremble and fall 
 But let me say how much I love You 
 O my Savior, my Lord and friend 
 Just let me hear Your finest whispers 
 As You gently call my name 
 And let me see Your power and Your glory 
 Let me feel Your Spirit's flame 
 Let me find You in the desert 
 'Til this sand is holy ground 
 And I am found completely surrendered 
 To You, my Lord and friend 
 So let me say how much I love You 
 With all my heart I long for You 
 For I am caught in this passion of knowing 
 This endless love I've found in You 
 And the depth of grace, the forgiveness found 
 To be called a child of God 
 Just makes me say how much I love You 
 O my Savior, my Lord and friend 
 Just makes me say how much I love You 
 O my Savior, my Lord and friend

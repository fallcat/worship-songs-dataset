This love, this hope 
 This peace of God 
 This righteousness 
 This faith, this joy 
 This life complete in me 
 Now healed and whole 
 And risen in His righteousness 
 I live in Him 
 He lives in me 
 And filled with this hope in God 
 Reflecting His Glory 
 Now is the time to worship You 
 Now is the time to offer You 
 All of my thoughts, my dreams and plans 
 I Lay it down 
 Now is the time to live for You 
 Now is the time I'm found in You 
 Now is the time Your Kingdom comes

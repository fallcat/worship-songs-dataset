This is our nation, this is our land 
 This is our future, this is our hope 
 A land of reaping, a land of harvest 
 This is our land, this is our home 
 This is the great southland of the holy spirit 
 A land of red dust plains and summer rains 
 To this sunburn land we will see a flood 
 And to this great southland, his spirit comes 
 This is a nation, this is our land 
 This land of plenty, this land of hope 
 The richest harvest is in her peoples 
 We see revival, his spirit comes 
 This is our nation, this is our land 
 This lucky country of dreams gone dry 
 And to these people we see a harvest 
 And to this land, his spirit comes 
 This is our nation, this is our land 
 This lucky country of dreams gone dry 
 And to these people we see a harvest 
 And to this land, his spirit comes

This grace is mine 
 This glory earthbound, heaven sent 
 This plan divine 
 This life, this light that breaks my night 
 The Spirit of God, heaven falls like a dove 
 To my heart 
 This love is mine 
 So undeserved this glorious name 
 This Son, This God 
 This life, this death, this victory won 
 Forgiveness has flowed and this grace 
 That is mine fills my heart 
 The power and the glory of Your name 
 The power and the glory of Your name 
 The power and the glory of Your name 
 The name of the Lord 
 The Son of God 
 This life is mine 
 So perfect and so pure, this God in me 
 This glorious hope 
 From earth to heaven, death to life 
 This future assured and secured 
 By this love in my heart

We need reviving 
 For this nation to see you 
 Purifying, to ever see your face 
 To be holy 
 To know the power of your Spirit 
 To be righteous, by will and by grace 
 And we will know your power 
 The power of your Spirit 
 And we will know your love 
 We will know your grace 
 We proclaim the truth 
 Forgiven, cleansed and holy 
 Then we will know your power 
 For we will see your face 
 We need reviving 
 For our hearts to be mended 
 Sanctifying, to know your power within 
 To be forgiven 
 And turn as a nation to seek you 
 To know your fire 
 Fire of passion, fire of love

You rescued me, and picked me up 
 A living hope, of grace revealed 
 A life transformed, in righteous 
 Oh Lord, you have rescued me 
 Forgiving me, you healed my heart 
 And set me free, from sin and death 
 You brought me life, you've made me whole 
 Oh Lord you have rescued me 
 And you loved me, before I knew you 
 And you knew me for all time 
 I've been created in your image, oh Lord 
 And you brought me 
 And you sought me 
 Your blood poured out for me 
 A new creation in your Image, oh Lord 
 You rescued me 
 You rescued me

A mighty fortress is our God 
 A bulwark never failing 
 Our helper He amid the flood 
 Of mortal ills prevailing 
 For still our ancient foe 
 Doth seek to work us woe 
 His craft and power are great 
 And armed with cruel hate 
 On earth is not His equal 
 Did we in our own strength confide? 
 Our striving would be losing 
 Were not the right man on our side 
 The man of God's own choosing 
 Dost ask who that may be 
 Christ Jesus, it is He 
 Lord Sabbaoth, His name 
 From age to age the same 
 And he must win the battle 
 And though this world, with devils filled 
 Should threaten to undo us 
 We will not fear, for God hath willed 
 His truth to triumph through us 
 The Prince of Darkness grim 
 We tremble not for him 
 His rage we can endure 
 We know, his doom is sure 
 One little word will fell him 
 One little word will fell him 
 One little word will fell him 
 That word above all earthly powers 
 No thanks to them, abideth 
 The Spirit and the gifts are ours 
 Through him who with us sideth 
 Let goods and kindred go 
 This mortal life also 
 The body they may kill 
 God's truth is living still 
 His kingdom is 
 Forever and ever, Amen

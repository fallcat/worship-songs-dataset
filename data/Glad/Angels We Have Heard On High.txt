Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 Say what made the tidings be 
 Which inspire your heavenly song? 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 In excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 Him, Whose birth the angels sing 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ the Lord, the newborn King 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo! 
 In excelsis Deo!

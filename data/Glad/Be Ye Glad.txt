In these days of confused situations 
 In this night of a restless remorse 
 When the heart and the soul of a nation 
 Lay wounded and cold as a corpse 
 From the grave of the innocent Adam 
 Comes a song bringing joy to the sad 
 Oh, your cry has been heard and the ransom 
 Has been paid up in full, be ye glad 
 Oh, be ye glad 
 Oh, be ye glad 
 Every debt that you've ever had 
 Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord 
 Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad 
 So be like lights on the rim of the water 
 Giving hope in a storm sea of night 
 Be a refuge amidst the slaughter 
 Of these fugitives in their flight 
 For you are timeless and part of a puzzle 
 You are winsome and young as a lad 
 And there is no disease or no struggle 
 That can pull you from God, be ye glad 
 Oh, be ye glad 
 Oh, be ye glad 
 Every debt that you ever had 
 Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord 
 Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad 
 Oh, be ye glad 
 Oh, be ye glad 
 Every debt that you ever had 
 Has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord 
 Be ye glad, be ye glad, be ye glad

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! 
 Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! 
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God 
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood 
 Washed in His blood, washed in His blood 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Perfect submission, perfect delight 
 Visions of rapture now burst on my sight 
 Angels descending bring from above 
 Echoes of mercy, whispers of love 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long, all the day long 
 Perfect submission, all is at rest 
 I in my Savior am happy and blest 
 Watching and waiting, looking above 
 Filled with His goodness, filled with His goodness lost in His love 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long, all the day long 
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! 
 This is my story, this is my song

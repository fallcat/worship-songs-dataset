Hear the bells ringing 
 They're singing that You can be born again 
 Hear the bells ringing 
 They're singing Christ is risen from the dead 
 The angel's up on the tombstone 
 Said, "He's risen just as He said 
 Quickly now, go tell His disciples 
 That Jesus Christ is no longer dead" 
 Joy to the world 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah

 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 He's risen, risen, risen from the dead 
 He's risen, risen, risen from the dead 
 Hallelujah, hallelu, hallelujah

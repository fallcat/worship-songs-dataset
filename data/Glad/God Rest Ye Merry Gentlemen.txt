God rest ye merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay 
 Remember Christ, our Savior was born on Christmas Day 
 To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy 
 From God, our Heavenly Father a blessed angel came 
 And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same 
 How that in Bethlehem was born, 'The Son of God' by name 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy 
 And when they came to Bethlehem, where our dear Savior lay 
 They found Him in a manger, where oxen feed on hay 
 His Mother Mary kneeling down unto the Lord did pray 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy 
 Sing tidings of comfort, of comfort and joy 
 Of comfort and joy 
 Now, to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place 
 And with true love and brotherhood, each other now embrace 
 This holy tide of Christmas, all others doth deface 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
 Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, of comfort and joy

It came upon the midnight clear 
 That glorious song of old 
 From angels bending near the earth 
 To touch their harps of gold 
 Peace on the earth, good will to men 
 From heaven's all gracious king 
 The world in solemn stillness lay 
 To hear the angels sing 
 Still through the cloven skies they come 
 With peaceful wings unfurled 
 And still their heavenly music floats 
 Over all the weary world 
 Above its sad and lowly plains 
 They bend on hovering wing 
 And ever over its Babel sounds 
 The blessed angels sing 
 The angels sing, blessed angels sing 
 For lo! The days are hastening on 
 By prophets once foretold 
 When with the ever circling years 
 Comes from the age of God 
 When peace shall over all the earth 
 Its ancient splendors fling 
 And the whole world sing back the song 
 Which now the angels sing 
 Hear the angels sing 
 [Incomprehensible] angels sing 
 It came upon the midnight clear 
 It came upon the midnight clear 
 Midnight clear

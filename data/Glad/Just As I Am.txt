I've had a lot of big dreams 
 I've made a lot of bad moves 
 I know you could walk away 
 But you never do 
 I've met a lot of cold hearts 
 I've learned to smile and deceive 
 I know I'm hard to be around 
 But you never leave 
 I'm not easy to understand 
 But you hold out your hand 
 And you say you love me 
 Just as I am 
 You always treat me 
 The best that you can 
 You say you want me, need me 
 Love me baby 
 Just as I am, just as I am 
 I've made a lot of heartaches 
 I've found a lot of closed doors 
 When all the others turn away 
 You love me more 
 You love me more 
 I'm not easy to understand 
 But you hold out your hand 
 And you say you love me 
 Just as I am 
 You always treat me 
 The best that you can 
 You say you want me, need me 
 Love me baby 
 Just as I am, just as I am 
 I want to love forever 
 To keep our world together 
 And be the best that I can be 
 Baby, every time the world 
 Caves in on me 
 And you say 
 Just as I am 
 You always treat me 
 The best that you can 
 You say you want me, need me 
 Love me baby 
 Just as I am, just as I am

O little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight 
 For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above 
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love 
 O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth 
 And praises sing to God the King and peace to men on Earth 
 O Holy Child of Bethlehem descend to us, we pray 
 Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today 
 We hear the Christmas angels, the great glad tidings tell 
 O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel, Emmanuel

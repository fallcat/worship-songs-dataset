Oh, God, my God, I seek Your face 
 You'll always be my resting place 
 My body's weak and my soul is dry 
 Your love alone can satisfy 
 My heart and fill me with delight 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 Oh, God, my God, I seek Your face 
 You'll always be my resting place 
 My body's weak and my soul is dry 
 Your love alone can satisfy 
 My heart and fill me with delight 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 I have seen You in the quiet times 
 With no one else around 
 Your power and Your glory overwhelm me 
 And no matter what tomorrow holds 
 My praise will know no bound 
 For Your presence will be there again to help me 
 Oh, God, my God, I seek Your face 
 You'll always be my resting place 
 My body's weak and my soul is dry 
 Your love alone can satisfy 
 My heart and fill me with delight 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 I have seen You in the quiet times 
 With no one else around 
 Your power and Your glory overwhelm me 
 And no matter what tomorrow holds 
 My praise will know no bound 
 For Your presence will be there again to help me 
 Oh, God, my God, I seek Your face 
 You'll always be my resting place 
 My body's weak and my soul is dry 
 Your love alone can satisfy 
 My heart and fill me with delight 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 Oh, God, my God, You are my life 
 You are my life

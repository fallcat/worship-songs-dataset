Praise to the Lord 
 (Praise to the Lord) 
 Praise to the Lord, the Almighty 
 (The Almighty) 
 The Almighty 
 Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation 
 (Praise the Lord) 
 O my soul, praise Him 
 For He is your health and salvation 
 (Praise the Lord) 
 All you who hear, now to His temple draw near 
 Join me in glad adoration 
 (Praise the Lord, praise to the Lord) 
 Praise to the Lord 
 Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth 
 (Praise the Lord, the Almighty, praise to the Lord) 
 Shelters through under His wings and so gently sustaineth 
 Have you not seen how long your longings have been 
 Granted in what He ordaineth 
 Praise to the Lord 
 Who doth prosper thy work and defend thee 
 Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend you 
 Often in grief, has He not brought you relief 
 (Spreading His arms) 
 Spreading His arms out to shade you 
 Praise to the Lord 
 O let all that is in me, adore Him 
 (Praise the Lord) 
 All that hath life and breath 
 Come now with praises before Him 
 (Praise to the Lord) 
 Let the 'Amen' sound from His people again 
 Gladly His people adore Him 
 Gladly His people adore Him, adore Him 
 Praise to the Lord 
 Praise to the Lord, the Almighty 
 Praise to the Lord

There will never be another reason 
 For the dawning of the day 
 There will never come a moment in time 
 When the heavens cease to say 
 “Glory to the Father’s Hand” (There will never be another reason) 
 We must follow His command (There will never be another reason) 
 Command (There will never be another reason) 
 Command 
 (Silently) The song is raised 
 (Silently) In endless praise 
 (Aah aah aah aah) Praise 
 (Aah aah aah aah) Praise 
 (Aah aah aah aah) Pra-a-a-a-a-a-a-aise 
 (There will never be another reason) 
 There will never be another reason 
 For the life that you’ve been given 
 Life that you’ve been given 
 Let the song of prayer that rings to your heart 
 Like a nail that’s only driven 
 Hear the earth rise up and sing (There will never be another reason) 
 Giving glory to our King (There will never be another reason) 
 Our King (There will never be another reason) 
 Our King (Hear the earth rise up and sing) 
 (Aah aah aah aah) 
 (Aah aah aah aah) 
 Giving glory to our King 
 Giving glory to our King 
 Giving glory to our King (King)

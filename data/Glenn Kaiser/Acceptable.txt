All could never be enough to fully pay my debt 
 For all the wrong I've done 
 Now You say it is enough that I accept the Gift 
 The offering of Your Son 
 Jesus, Sacrifice, Acceptable to God 
 Jesus paid the price I owed 
 Gave me new life for old 
 All could never be enough to demonstrate my worth 
 My value or my merit 
 Now Your grace is grace enough 
 Your love is love enough 
 Adopted I inherit

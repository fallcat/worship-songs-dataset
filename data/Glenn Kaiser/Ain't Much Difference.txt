I been broken, I have lost in love 
 I've been cheated, mistreated 
 Yeah, I have lost in love 
 But one thing is for certain 
 I know I ain't the only one 
 Sometimes I been the victim 
 Sometimes I been victimized 
 Sometimes I've been the victim 
 But it's all just human nature 
 Ain't no use tryin' to disguise 
 I have been broken 
 Yeah I have lost in love 
 I been cheated, mistreated 
 I have lost in love 
 But one thing is for certain 
 I know I ain't the only one 
 The mistress an' the mister 
 The rooster an' the hen 
 The butcher an' the baker 
 You an' me, my feathered friends 
 The doctor an' the lawyer 
 The Indian chief too 
 Hey, ain't much difference 
 Tell the truth, tell the truth 
 Have you been broken 
 An' have ya tore up others too? 
 If you're lookin' for the reason 
 Ain't got to look past me an' you 
 Ain't much difference 
 Ain't much difference 
 Tell the truth

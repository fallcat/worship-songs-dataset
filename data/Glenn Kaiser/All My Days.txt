God, You are my God and I praise You 
 Lord, You are my Lord and I love You 
 God, You are my God and I praise You 
 Lord, You are my Lord and I long for You 
 How I long for your presence 
 How I look to Your grace 
 How I search for Your heart's desire 
 To walk with You (3x) 
 All my days 
 Lord, You rule over all eternity 
 Who, who am I that You care for me 
 Lord, You are the God of the universe 
 Oh, the depth of Your love amazes me

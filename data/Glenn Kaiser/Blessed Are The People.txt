Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound 
 They shall walk, oh Lord, in the light of Thy face (2x) 
 In Thy name shall they rejoice 
 All of the day 
 And in Thy name shall they rejoice 
 All of the day (2x) 
 For Thou art my glory and my strength 
 For Thou, oh Lord, art my defense 
 For Thou art my glory and my strength 
 And the Holy One of Israel is my King 
 And the Holy One of Israel is my King!

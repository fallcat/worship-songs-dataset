You who separated dark and light 
 You who made the great and lesser lights 
 Now in You I come to quiet rest 
 Through the night You hold me safe and fast 
 Shadows falling I am in Your care 
 Thankful praises from these lips You hear 
 Lying in the wonder of this night 
 Living in the knowledge of Your heart 
 I come in need 
 I go in peace 
 I grow in grace 
 In You find rest 
 I grow in grace 
 And sleep in peace 
 At the end of it all 
 In Your blessed rest 
 We come in need 
 We go in peace 
 We grow in grace 
 In You find rest 
 We grow in grace 
 So sleep in peace 
 At the end of it all 
 In Your blessed rest

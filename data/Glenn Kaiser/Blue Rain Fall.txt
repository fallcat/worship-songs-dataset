I woke up early in the morning 
 Just to hear the sound of the blue rain fall, all around 
 I woke up this morning 
 Saw the blue rain fall 
 Lord, I woke up this morning 
 Some folk didn't wake up at all 
 Had that blues for my breakfast 
 Blues in my head 
 You dressed me and possessed me 
 Man, you know that I ain't dead 
 Woke up in the morning 
 Saw the blue rain fall 
 Lord, I woke up this morning, 
 Some folk didn't wake up at all 
 God knows I ain't complainin' 
 Sometimes I still do 
 When the rain falls with a vengeance 
 Separatin' me from you 
 I woke up this morning, 
 Just like I'm used to do 
 Crawled outta bed, what am I supposed to do? 
 Heaven's tears fallin', Lord, help me love like You 
 If I can stop one heart from breakin' 
 Shall not live in vain 
 Ease one life from achin' 
 Or cool warm pain 
 Help one faintin' robin 
 Into his nest again 
 I shall not live in vain 
 So, what about the rain? 
 Without it nothin' grows at all 
 Wakin' up in the mornin' 
 Thankful for that blue rain fall 
 Blue rain fall, oh-oh

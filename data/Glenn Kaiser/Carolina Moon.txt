Spanish moss is still in the heat of a carolina moon 
 Dogs barkin' in the night, a lonely lady 
 Slowly trails a broom 
 Her man is gone, an' the grass, 
 Well it ain't been mowed for days 
 When did those years full of song play out 
 Wet is the color of her face 
 Color of her face 
 In the bittersweet night in the low hill country 
 She remembers that antebellum square 
 Dolly gets in bed, pulls the ribbon from her head, 
 And cries to a husband that ain't there 
 And that carolina moon 
 Is the only light she has known 
 As the creeping years consumed her dreams 
 And all that she called home (2x) 
 Under a carolina moon 
 Dolly found her man in a time of trouble 
 And the future looked so bright 
 But the loneliness is the only thing 
 Left in her carolina night 
 Hattie calls on Saturday 
 She mentions church but dolly doesn't say 
 Too many calendars have gone their way 
 Since this little lady thought to pray 
 Somehow tonight she gotta feel the light 
 To know the One who can make things right (2x) 
 And the carolina moon 
 Is the only light she has known 
 As the creeping years consume her dreams 
 And all that she called home 
 The carolina moon is the only light she has known 
 As the creeping years consume her dreams 
 There's a Sun who calls her home 
 Carolina moon

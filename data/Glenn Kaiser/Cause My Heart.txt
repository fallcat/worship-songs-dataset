Cause my heart to fear Your name 
 Cause my life to reveal the same 
 Let the holiness from Your throne 
 So mark me as Your own 
 Cause my heart to fear Your name 
 Cause my life to reveal the same 
 In the purity of Your love 
 Touched by fire from above 
 Cause my heart to fear Your name 
 Cause my mouth to exalt Your worth 
 Cause my soul to rejoice in new birth 
 In the majesty of Your grace 
 Send your Spirit to this place 
 Lord and Christ, last and first

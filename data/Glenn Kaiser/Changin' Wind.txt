Sometimes I recall the way it used to be 
 Cold September wind, darkness down on me 
 Passion that I felt so deep inside 
 Mirrors always made me want to hide 
 Uphill every day, family just in ruins 
 People livin' for themselves and livin' on excuses 
 Life became a one-act misery 
 Struggle made a stranger out of me 
 It was a changin' wind, a rearrangin' wind 
 It was a changin', rearrangin' wind 
 It was a changin' wind 
 Sometimes I remember just the way it felt 
 Blisters in my ragged soul, blowin' in from hell 
 Passion that just seemed a ball an' chain 
 That was my life before the Savior came 
 It was a changin' wind, a powerful wind 
 It was a changin', rearrangin' wind 
 A rearrangin' wind

(Aww, let's make a deal baby ...) 
 They had truth by the wallet 
 In a Nashville heat 
 Sharkskin suit wit' the tired feet 
 Couldn't reconcile value 
 With the bottom line 
 In a white throne moment-ran outta time 
 Song an' dance man in a cheap burlesque 
 Pump it up loud so the firm'll invest 
 Gotcha thinkin' and droolin', 
 Gonna make a run 
 At some midnight condos on the 
 Face of the sun 
 Things goin' haywire 
 I can't keep my mind shut 
 As the business simmers 
 I get all choked up 
 All choked up 
 (Aww, you know 
 It's hurtin' me darlin'...) 
 Bull market's open for pork belly boys 
 Fallen golden arches and Internet toys 
 Pretty weed garden 
 Where snakeskins lay 
 Saw whips in the temple 
 Saw the merchants pay 
 Things lookin' haywire 
 I can't keep my mind shut 
 As the intrigue simmers 
 I get all choked up 
 All choked up 
 (Aww, this touches my greasy heart ...) 
 Gimmie your wallet! Let's make a deal! 
 Hey man, what's in it for ME, man?! 
 Just sign right here, and here, and here ... 
 (Aww, you worry me baby ...)

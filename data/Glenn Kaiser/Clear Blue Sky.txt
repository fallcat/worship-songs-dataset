To walk in the field once again 
 Comforting breeze on my face 
 To feel the wet and the lure 
 Power of creative grace 
 To realize the quiet 
 Peace of a different kind 
 The harmony of all things here 
 It's a climate of loving design 
 To sit at the base of the bark and the leaf 
 The kiss of sweet sunsets again 
 Discovering eyes peering through the mist 
 No trust in the instincts of man 
 Night unto day is that mercy revealed 
 Hour upon hour I come to be healed 
 Emptied of seasons of tears that I cried 
 This blinded soul finally saw 
 The clear blue sky 
 Your fingerprints here all around me 
 All the more reason for praise 
 Refreshed in the wind of Your Spirit 
 I feel You in nature's embrace 
 So many demons gone to their place 
 All about honesty not saving face 
 Time enough left to do what I must 
 Loving and living in faith and in trust

Everybody wants contact 
 Everybody wants comfort and concern 
 Nobody likes conflict 
 Or rarely likes watching bridges burn 
 Everybody wants love 
 Everybody wants faithfulness 
 Nobody wants silence 
 Nobody loves distance, loneliness 
 Emotions, feelings 
 Everybody wants grace 
 Freedom to explore 
 Everybody loves truth 
 But when our conscience gets ignored 
 Your thoughts my wants 
 My thoughts your needs 
 Why should anyone care about anything 
 If there's NO reality 
 Emotions, feelings 
 Drowning, we need healing 
 Everybody wants comfort 
 And we want it our way 
 Everybody needs patience 
 And we want it today 
 In a fallen world 
 How do we cope 
 Like dying children 
 At the end of our rope 
 In the love of God 
 In the light of faith 
 There is no shame 
 When you find your place 
 Emotion 
 Feeling 
 Savior 
 Healing 
 To know that grace 
 To be embraced

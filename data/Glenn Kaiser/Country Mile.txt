I just got to see Your face, Lord 
 How I wanna see You smile (2x) 
 At the end of the road they'll hear us 
 Shoutin' for a country mile 
 Life was so strange, 
 Seemed like nothin' ever came my way (2x) 
 When the nighttime passes 
 I'll greet You at the break of day 
 Well I needed shelter, needed to be free (2x) 
 In the mornin' Your love rescued me

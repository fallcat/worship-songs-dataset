In the darkness of my sin 
 Won't You come and light my path 
 Lord, deliver me 
 In the cold and rainy day, 
 I've lost my way 
 Lord, deliver me 
 Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord 
 Be the light in my hour of need 
 I am a sinful man, please heal me once again 
 Oh, Lord, deliver me 
 Before my eyes were opened I was blind and could not see 
 In that midnight hour, You came and spoke to me 
 My heart had been so hard and, my mind was so confused 
 Till Your grace brought me, brought me to believe 
 Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord 
 You're the light in my hour of need 
 I am a sinful man, please heal me once again 
 Oh, Lord, deliver me 
 Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord 
 Be my light in my hour of night 
 I am a sinful man, please heal me once again 
 Oh, Lord, deliver me 
 Oh, deliver me

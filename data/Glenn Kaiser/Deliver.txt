Talk talk talk is cheap 
 Where's the action 
 A church so fast asleep 
 Got no attraction 
 A band lookin' oh so good 
 With nothin' but sound 
 Ain't givin' much to this world 
 Just spinnin' down 
 Time will tell 
 When the book is opened wide 
 Did ya' deliver? 
 What did you deliver? 
 Who did you deliver? 
 Or did ya' keep it inside... 
 Time is runnin' down 
 Excuses don't accomplish somethin' 
 Some might see your truth 
 Others don't see nothin' 
 But when the blind lead the blind 
 Accidents are sure to happen 
 There is a world goin' to hell 
 And a lotta critics' jaws just flappin' 
 You say they just weren't elected too 
 I say deliver the truth 
 Or God says their blood's on you 
 Did ya' deliver? 
 What did you deliver? 
 Who did you deliver? 
 Or did ya' keep it inside...

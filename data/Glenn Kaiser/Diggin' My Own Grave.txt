I was lookin 
 at disaster square in the face 
 I was losin 
 stride in the human race 
 And I had no one to plead my case 
 Blowin 
 smoke in my own face 
 Lost my grip in a slip'ry time 
 I left my friends by the wayside 
 And I was sure nuff no friend of mine 
 When you need to be rescued, now is the time 
 Sweat drips and eyes burn 
 Lips pressed tight on this hardened face 
 I was diggin 
 my own grave 
 Pain in my heart, mud all over my dreams 
 Stumblin 
 , fallen, just a downhill disease 
 Cause the up was nonexistent, and I was the down 
 And they talked behind my back all over town 
 There 
 s nothin 
 more tragic than a suicidal slave 
 I was diggin 
 my own grave 
 Sweat drips and eyes burn 
 Lips pressed tight on this hardened face 
 And the head hangs, heart breaks, soul bleeds 
 I was diggin 
 my own grave And the lights came on, I swear I don't know how And I let go of the here and now And the Son of Man said He came to seek and save Now I ain 
 t diggin 
 no more, no more diggin 
 My own grave

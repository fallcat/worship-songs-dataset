I use you when I need you 
 And leave you when I'm done 
 I've never told you anything 
 But truth beneath this sun 
 I'm a prairie where love wanders 
 Dying of terrible thirst 
 When the vultures find your carcass 
 Babe I'll be the first 
 I wish I was the devil 
 I wish I was the Lord 
 The hunger of this twisted heart 
 Best be left ignored 
 You drive me down to Shonkin 
 Standing by the creek 
 You rub a bluebell's petals 
 On the stubble of my cheek 
 Your lips bleed when I kiss you 
 Prairie dogs go 
 Underground 
 Montana skies consume us 
 I resist that whispered sound 
 The stars obliterated 
 You leave me the night 
 I find myself by myself 
 Stripped of love and all that's right 
 I wish I was a demon 
 With no knowledge of what's good 
 But every kiss you give me 
 Is like nails through new wood 
 I love you and I hate you 
 I'll kill you with compassion 
 I spout desire's lust 
 As philosophy and fashion 
 I'm not worth a single glance 
 Why do you still pursue me? 
 I never knew love was so strong 
 Oh God you've overcome me

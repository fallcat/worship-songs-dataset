Draw me closer, ever closer, Lord, to You 
 Draw me closer, ever closer, me to You 
 Love too pure for a heart like mine 
 Grace too costly for me 
 Tender mercies now and to 
 Eternity (2x) 
 Draw me nearer, ever nearer, Lord, to You 
 Draw me nearer, You who are dearer then my due 
 Father of wonders, author of truth 
 Worship and honor are Yours 
 Glory and majesty, blessing and praise 
 To Jesus our Lord (2x)

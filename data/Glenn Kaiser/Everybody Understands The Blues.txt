Uptown, downtown, all around 
 You can see it in their faces 
 Down to the holes in their shoes 
 Everybody understands the blues 
 Black an' white 
 Brown an' yellow 
 Red man too 
 Regardless of their wallet 
 Sometimes they win sometimes they losses 
 Only one thing for certain 
 Everybody understands the blues 
 Death an taxes 
 Political scams 
 Bill collectors who'll snag you if they can 
 A leak in the ceiling 
 Rush hour jams 
 I'll say it again no matter where I go or when 
 You can see it in their faces 
 Down to the holes in their shoes 
 There ain't no doubt about it 
 Everybody understands the blues 
 Yeah there are solutions 
 But very few of them will last 
 So many runnin' hopeless 
 Too man runnin' outa gas 
 Be a prophet or a king 
 A sinner or a saint 
 A lawyer or a liar 
 A believer in fate 
 Somebody understands exactly what you're goin' through 
 Hey, everybody understands the blues

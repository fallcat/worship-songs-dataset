In the cool, cool wind, 
 In the sweet, sweet rain 
 I thought I heard Your voice, 
 Heard You call out my name 
 In the pink light of dawn 
 In the soft glow of dusk 
 I see Your tender hand 
 And I feel Your touch 
 All around us, everywhere 
 Is evidence of Your loving care 
 But when the mind is closed 
 We can be blind to the purest gold 
 When the eyes grow dark, 
 And the feet move so slow 
 And the hair turns to snow 
 In growing old 
 I will talk with You still 
 I will walk with You still 
 For Your love all around is somethin 
 Nothin 
 else can fill 
 Yes I know (Yes I know) 
 Yes, yes I know (Yes I know) 
 That this yearning inside me for You 
 It just grows and grows

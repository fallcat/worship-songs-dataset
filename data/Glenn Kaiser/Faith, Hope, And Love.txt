Times it may seem a breeze 
 When I get down on my knees 
 But it takes me a moment 
 To face myself inside 
 And the wonder of it all, 
 That You keep me standin' tall 
 And You hear my cry for help when I feel so small 
 Talkin' 'bout faith, hope, and love 
 Power from the Spirit above 
 Faith, hope, and love 
 Made the difference in me 
 It knocked me down, turned up the heat 
 It opened my eyes, made me move my feet 
 Lifted my hands, and it filled my soul 
 It brought me life when I was dead and cold 
 Gives me strength when I'm feelin' old 
 Restores my joy, and it makes me bold 
 Faith, hope, and love 
 Power from the Spirit above 
 Nothin' but faith, hope, and love 
 Has made the difference in me 
 I don't know why people try to be so hard 
 All I know, in the grace of God 
 I found love when I dropped my guard 
 We fall down to get up 
 And we kneel to be lifted above 
 Faith, hope, and love 
 Has made the difference for me 
 (Talkin' 'bout) faith, hope, and love 
 And a power from the Spirit above 
 Yah, faith, hope, and love 
 Has made the difference in me 
 You made the difference in me

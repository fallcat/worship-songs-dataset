I was there 
 When you turned your face to the wall 
 I was there 
 When you felt you were ten feet tall 
 I was there 
 When nobody knew your name 
 I'll be there 
 And I'll tell you again and again 
 You are fearfully, wondrously, gloriously, lovingly made 
 You are loved, you are wanted, desired 
 I'll tell you again and again 
 You are fearfully, wondrously, gloriously, lovingly made 
 There were times 
 When you wondered if I was around 
 There were times 
 When you stumbled and fell to the ground 
 There were times 
 When you tried to avoid every test 
 But everything works for your good 
 When you love, when you trust you find rest

It ain't my real hair 
 It ain't my real name 
 It's just my p.r. 
 It ain't my real fame 
 Now ya' see it but ya' think you don't 
 You gonna buy it but ya' think you won't 
 Image imagine, electric facade 
 It's a trip, chip, clip of your wallet, honey 
 Gotcha... you need that style 
 60-year-old investors 
 45-year-old boss 
 30-year-old shop owners 
 15-year-old consumers being massaged 
 By a worldwide industrialized computerized mirage 
 We've learned no style sells 
 Free-style as well 
 To the best-dressed self-obsessed people in hell 
 'Cause life ain't made of the stuff you got 
 And the cross ain't sellin' where the cattle shop 
 Gotcha... you need that style 
 It's the price of hype 
 Down to the store-bought smile 
 And the price was right 
 It only cost ya' your life honey 
 Gotcha... you need that style!

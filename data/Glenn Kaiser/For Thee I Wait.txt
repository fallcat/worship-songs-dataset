I see You in tear and in tempest 
 I hear You in laughter and mirth 
 Your presence now surrounds me 
 In the mystery of death and birth 
 I bow before Your majesty 
 Worship before Your throne 
 You speak in language eternal 
 There Your glory is shown 
 I feel You in field and woodland 
 Touch You in rain and in wind 
 I know You in morning and evening 
 Where the dawn and dusk begin 
 Oh, Thou enthroned in Thy splendor 
 Maker of all we survey 
 To Thee I pledge my truest love 
 For Thy appearing I wait

Ya work all day jus' ta pay your bills 
 Lookin' for strength to motivate your will 
 Reachin' for life, yer searchin' for love 
 In every direction but the one above 
 Don't ya know that life is more than fuss and moan 
 Open your heart, child-honey, come on home 
 You met on Friday, by Sunday he's gone 
 He took what he wanted, girl, 
 And moved right on 
 Everyone knows that's a typical scene 
 Make you wanna cry, wanna make you scream 
 Don't ya know that life is more than fuss and moan 
 Open your heart, child-Jesus wants to bring you home 
 I finally faced the darkness in my own life 
 Understood people couldn't do me right 
 I grew up fast an' I grew up cold 
 Naturally stubborn and naturally bold 
 Always thought people didn't do me right 
 I finally faced the darkness in my own life 
 Don't ya know I got tired of the fuss and moan 
 Glad to say, I finally found my way home 
 No more fuss and moan-no no 
 No more fuss and moan 
 Honey, come on home 
 Life is more than fuss and moan

Gonna meet you at the station 
 Gonna leave when the train pulls out 
 Meet you at the station 
 Gonna roll with a jump and shout 
 Gonna pack as fast as lightnin' 
 With my spirit cryin' out 
 Gonna leave this tragedy 
 Go beyond this veil of tears 
 Beyond this tragedy 
 Rollin' far from all my fears 
 Far away from enemies 
 With my rider oh so dear 
 At the station, gonna meet you 
 Won't you meet me at the station 
 Won't you rock me down the track 
 Come an' greet me at the station 
 We ain't never comin' back 
 Gonna meet ya 
 Will you meet me at the station 
 Won't you rock me down the track 
 Come an' greet me at the station 
 We ain't never comin' back 
 Through the moonlight we'll be flyin' 
 To a place there ain't no lack 
 Ain't no lack 
 Ain't no lack

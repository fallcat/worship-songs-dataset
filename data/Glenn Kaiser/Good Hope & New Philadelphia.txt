There is a town 
 And it's a little one 
 You take the road to Good Hope 
 Many pass on by 
 Not much to look at 
 But we need it so 
 Where brother meets brother 
 With respect in his eye 
 Where sister loves sister 
 You can live and die in peace 
 In Good Hope 
 And a little bit southeast 
 There's another road 
 To New Philadelphia 
 I have seen high corn and beans 
 And painted ponies in the fields 
 'Round New Philadelphia 
 Well the land is rich 
 But a family can be richer still 
 When birth is a celebration 
 And a little town stands still 
 When to bury its own 
 Is a solemn 
 Goodbye 
 Where it matters what you think 
 How you eat and drink 
 And it matters how you live and die 
 In New Philadelphia 
 Up these roads 
 With the red-winged blackbirds 
 Up these roads 
 Where neighbors wave 
 Up these roads 
 Where the sun and rain both greet you 
 Gravel, dirt, or paved 
 Good Hope and New Philadelphia 
 On the road to Good Hope 
 I'm on the road 
 To New Philadelphia 
 God's grace unfolds 
 Come ride with a Friend

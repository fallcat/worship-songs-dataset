I been broken, I have lost in love 
 I've been cheated, mistreated 
 Yeah, I have lost in love 
 But one thing is for certain 
 I know I ain't the only one 
 Sometimes I been the victim 
 I got a hold on you an' I won't let go (2x) 
 I'm gonna move your feet 
 Gonna move your soul 
 I got a hold on you (5x) 
 An' I know that you love me too 
 Love is eternal 
 Love doesn't end 
 Love is eternal 
 Love never ends 
 You know I love you 
 I'll prove it again and again

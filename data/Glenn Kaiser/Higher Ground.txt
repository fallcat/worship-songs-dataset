People keep on learnin' 
 Soldiers keep on warrin' 
 World keep on turnin' 
 Cause it won't be too long 
 Powers keep on lyin' 
 While your people keep on dyin' 
 World keep on turnin' 
 Cause it won't be too long 
 I'm so darn glad he let me try it again 
 Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
 I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
 Gonna keep on tryin' 
 'Til I reach the highest ground 
 Teachers keep on teachin' 
 Preachers keep on preachin' 
 World keep on turnin' 
 Cause it won't be too long 
 Oh no 
 Lovers keep on lovin' 
 Believers keep on believin' 
 Sleepers just stop sleepin' 
 Cause it won't be too long 
 Oh no 
 I'm so glad that he let me try it again 
 Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
 I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
 Gonna keep on tryin' 
 'Til I reach my highest ground 
 'Til I reach my highest ground 
 Oh no 
 No one's gonna bring me down 
 Oh no 
 'Til I reach my highest ground 
 Don't you let nobody bring you down 
 God is gonna show you higher ground 
 He's the only friend you have around

Spirit come and fill us now 
 Wind and Holy Fire 
 Move upon, within, without 
 Lead to Your desire 
 Grant us knowledge of the Son 
 Will and Word and Thought be done 
 Worship Three and worship One 
 With the heav'nly choir 
 Praise to God and grace to man 
 Holy, Sovereign, Great I Am 
 Lord of Lords and Risen King 
 Healing mercy in Your wings 
 Son of Morning, Son of Man 
 Gift and fruit at Your command 
 Blessing promised, blessing planned 
 Spirit fill again 
 Spirit fill again

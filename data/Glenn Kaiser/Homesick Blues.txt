Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, 
 I just don't wanna be alone 
 I been travelin' so long 
 I got to find my way back home 
 It's comin' rain, rain down, 
 Rainin' down upon my head 
 Some days I know though I'm livin', 
 Lord, I feel like dead 
 Well, lightnin' strikes from 
 Over in the east straight west 
 I been holdin' too long, 
 Holdin' it beneath my vest 
 I need love sweet love, Honey, 
 I'm, you know I'm comin' home today 
 Oh, let your love rain down, now you 
 Know I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, 
 Lord, you know, 
 God, I will be on my way 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm comin' home!

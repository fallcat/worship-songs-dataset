Down every alley, up every street 
 Out in the country, where people meet 
 You see it daily, an' ya hear it too 
 Not only in others, it's in you 
 Feel the pain or cause it, 
 Right or wrong or both 
 Lion or a lamb don't confuse it 
 We're all in the same old boat 
 They sometimes lie and leave you, 
 An' use you then they're gone 
 The river rolls beyond you both, 
 But memories linger on 
 I might pass before you, 
 You might hang around 
 I might just outlive you, 
 Either way I forgive you 
 Yes I do-i forgive you 
 (Only way to live) 
 We don't work the same garden 
 But we had our share of strife 
 Still I beg your pardon 
 And I wish you love and life 
 No matter either way 
 I may never win you 
 But I found peace in Jesus 
 'Cause I forgive you, yes I do 
 I forgive you

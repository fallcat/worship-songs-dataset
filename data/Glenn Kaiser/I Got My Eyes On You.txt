I got My eyes on you 
 I got My eyes on you 
 All through the night, every day 
 Out in the woods, now and always 
 I got My eyes on you 
 I got My eyes on you 
 I know your every thirst 
 Your every pain 
 Deep desires and every step that you take 
 I got My eyes on you 
 Mmm, My eyes on you 
 Down in the house, 
 Out of the door 
 Work on the ridge 
 And in the valley low 
 I got My eyes on you 
 Oh, I got My eyes on you 
 I know your every thirst 
 Your every pain 
 Deep desires and every step that you take 
 I got My eyes on you 
 I got My eyes on you 
 I know you, and you know Me 
 No matter the moment 
 I got eyes to see 
 Into the city, out in the street 
 Even the night is like danger meet 
 I got My eyes on you 
 Mmm, I got My eyes on you 
 Down in the house, 
 Out of the door 
 Up on the ridge 
 And in the valley low 
 I got My eyes on you 
 Child, I got My eyes on you, oh... 
 I got My eyes on you 
 I'm watchin' over you 
 I got My eyes on you 
 No matter what you do 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I got My eyes on you 
 Oh, I do 
 I got My eyes on you 
 Oh, I got My eyes on you 
 I got My eyes... Oh! I got My eyes on you

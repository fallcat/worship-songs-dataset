If I had a million lives 
 It would never do 
 I could never give enough 
 To add one thing to You 
 All I am 
 All I can offer 
 All I'll ever be 
 Debtor to my Savior 
 I surrender all to Thee 
 Light in highest heaven 
 Tree and stream and field 
 Golden sunset pastureland 
 Sanctify our yield 
 Every voice of nature 
 Each and all declare 
 Your power 
 Your glory 
 Your majesty 
 Your care 
 Now in evening shadows 
 I will add my song 
 To the hills and hollows 
 Glancing up and on 
 King, Almighty, Sovereign 
 Gladly I shall be 
 Son to You, my Father 
 And I offer all to Thee

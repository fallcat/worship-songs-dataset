If I could hold you forever, I would 
 Keep you right by my side forever, I would 
 But I know you aren 
 t mine alone 
 And I respect the One on His throne 
 And I know that we should 
 He 
 s kind and He's good 
 Mmmm-hmmm 
 Girl, you are His greatest living gift to me 
 Girl, if I had to choose again what I'd do 
 I would choose you 
 If I could stay at home forever, I would 
 Or always travel 'round together, I would 
 But I know we share each other with God 
 And it's right to do, He is our Lord 
 And it's best and we should 
 He's so kind and so good 
 Mmmm-hmmm 
 But girl, you are the greatest gift of love to me 
 Girl, if I had to choose one more time what to do 
 I would choose you 
 Girl, you are the greatest gift, designed just for me 
 My my girl, knowing all of your secrets, it's true 
 I would choose you

I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb 
 I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb 
 I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb 
 Filled with the holy ghost I am 
 All my sins are wased away 
 I've been redeemed 
 And that's not all there's more to say 
 And that's not all there's more to say 
 And that's not all there's more to say 
 I've been to the River I've been baptized 
 All my sins are wased away I've been redeemed 
 I've you get there before I do 
 I've you get there before I do 
 I've you get there before I do 
 Tell my friends I'm comin' too 
 All my sins been wased away I've been redeemed 
 But the devil and me, whe both agree 
 Devil and me, whe both agree 
 Devil and me, whe both agree I hate him and he hates me 
 All my sins been wased away I've been redeemed 
 I've been redeemed I've been redeemed I've been redeemed

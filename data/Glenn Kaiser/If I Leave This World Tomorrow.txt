If I leave this world tomorrow 
 Lord, let me leave a little love behind 
 (2 x) 
 There is too much pain and misery 
 Too much heartache, too much cryin' 
 I seen my share of trouble 
 But God ain't failed me yet (2 x) 
 He's my Savior, my Deliverer 
 I'm just as saved as you can get 
 Jesus, be my Witness 
 Sin an' love are all we know (2 x) I will trust your mercy 
 Share your mercy where I go 
 (Repeat 1st verse and end)

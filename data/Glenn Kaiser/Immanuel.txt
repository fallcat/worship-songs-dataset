Immanuel, Lord of all life 
 Into the world You came 
 Darkness met light 
 Holy, holy, Lord over all 
 Hear us, near us 
 God with us now 
 Immanuel 
 Immanuel 
 Immanuel 
 God with us now 
 Immanuel, Lord of my life 
 Into my world You came 
 Dawn vanquished night 
 Holy, Holy, King over all 
 Hear me, near me 
 God with me now

In my younger days, 
 I almost lost my mind 
 In the summer of my days, swallowed anything I'd find 
 If I knew then what I know now, 
 I would have left it all behind 
 Lord, I drank myself to sleep, 
 And you know I woke up cryin' 
 I drugged myself to sleep, 
 How I used to wake up cryin' 
 Only one thing that I'm sure of- 
 Only grace kept me from dyin' 
 In my younger days 
 People looked at me 
 Like I was in my prime 
 Didn't know fact from fiction, 
 Not a dollar from a dime 
 In my younger days 
 In my younger days 
 Like a bolt of lightnin' 
 Through my windowpane 
 I saw the writin' on my wall, 
 And there I saw my name 
 In my younger days, 
 I finally hit the ground 
 I saw the door to paradise, and how I cried out loud 
 In my younger days 
 In my younger days 
 I met love-and it moved me 
 Gone from lost to bein' found

In the peace between the stillness 
 When quiet is the sound 
 I remember not believing 
 And yet the joy that now abounds 
 Jesus is like an ocean 
 He'll engulf and gently surround 
 With the tide of His love He'll astound you 
 And He's teaching me how to drown 
 In the ocean of His love 
 In the peace between life's stillness 
 When no one else is around 
 Do you have that peace with the Saviour? Do you know His love? Does His joy surround?

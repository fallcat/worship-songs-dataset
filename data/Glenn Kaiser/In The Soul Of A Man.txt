In the soul of a man, there ain't much room to hide 
 Until he reads his conscience, he cannot rest inside 
 I was born to know temptation, 
 Born to know the blues 
 I was born to face frustration, 
 I was born to know the blues 
 But I have overcome, 'cause I know 
 Who paid my dues 
 He paid my dues 
 In the soul of a man is a place only love can fill 
 In the soul of a woman, a need only love can fill 
 But I finally found salvation 
 In the One no one can kill

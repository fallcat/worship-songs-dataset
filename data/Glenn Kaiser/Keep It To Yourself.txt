She came into your life 
 One look stole your heart 
 Your friends can see it in your face 
 Even in the dark 
 You laid awake at night 
 Dreamin' of the day 
 When she would wear your ring 
 And that evidence would say 
 You know I love you 
 I'm so glad, show and tell 
 'Cause when your love is so strong 
 You just can't keep it to yourself 
 They hung me on the wood 
 My blood ran just like rain 
 I spoke on your behalf 
 And I'm comin' down again 
 You know I love you 
 They know in heaven and in hell 
 You say you love me 
 Why do you keep it to yourself? 
 People in the street, 
 They need to see and hear 
 Got noses full of cocaine 
 And bellies full o' beer 
 Credit cards and pretty yards 
 And kids that never knew 
 Who I am, and what I've done 
 And what I'll do for you 
 You say you love me 
 Ah, you got my book up on the shelf 
 You say you love me 
 Oh, if you love me 
 Why do you keep it to yourself? 
 Oh, if you love me 
 Ah, you gotta show and tell 
 'Cause when your love is so strong 
 You just can't... 
 When your love is so strong 
 You just can't keep it to yourself

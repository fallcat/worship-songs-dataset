Light of dawn reflecting love eternal 
 Light of morning open eyes now closed 
 Light of day in grace reach to our yearning 
 Light of lights come guide us to the day 
 Radiant light with timeless truth revealing 
 Brilliant light illuminate my path 
 Holy light reveal the shadows fleeing 
 Glorious light of heaven I give thanks 
 In this light, in this day 
 Light of Dawn 
 Son of God my love my hope eternal 
 Morning Star You've opened eyes once closed 
 Daystar giving grace to meet our yearning 
 Lord of light come guide us to the day 
 In this light, in this day 
 Will of God, be mine! 
 Light of Dawn 
 In Your love, on and on 
 Will of God, be mine! 
 Light of Dawn

Lord Jesus, take me by the hand 
 Make me like a little child again 
 Lord Jesus, help me understand 
 What it means to have You as a friend 
 Just like a windin' stream 
 My life goes flowin' by 
 But when I look up in the sky 
 I know You're near me 
 I used to feel so old 
 But now I've found that pot of gold

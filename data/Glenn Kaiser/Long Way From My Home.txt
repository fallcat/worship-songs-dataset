Tonight I am missin' you 
 Oh, tonight I am missin' you 
 In the light of day 
 I had lost my way 
 An' tonight I am missing you 
 Never thought I would come this far 
 I never thought I would come this far 
 I have come through such pain 
 In the strenth of your Name 
 Never thought I would come this far 
 I am a long. long way from my home 
 I am a long, long way from my home 
 I've been a pilgrim on this earth 
 Since the day of my birth 
 I'm a long way from my home 
 Tonight I'm sittin' on this porch in the rain 
 Tonight I'm sittin' on this porch in the rain 
 But Hallelujah by and by 
 I will meet you in the sky 
 I'm still a long, long way from home

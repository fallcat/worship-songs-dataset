A carpenter from Nazareth 
 A Man from Galilee 
 He talked a lot of love 
 And setting captives free 
 The men who rallied 'round Him 
 Fishermen by trade 
 He called out twelve 
 They followed Him 
 And fishermen He made 
 He spoke a lot in churches 
 And in the countryside 
 The people heard Him gladly 
 As He prophesied 
 About His Father's kingdom 
 Salvation through the Son 
 He exposed the liars 
 He had them on the run 
 One night they came and took Him 
 And nailed Him to a tree 
 Though He never sinned a single sin 
 He died for you and me 
 But He did just what He said He'd do 
 God raised Him from the grave 
 He said if we'd believe in Him 
 That we would be saved 
 Of all who came to follow 
 He never lost a one 
 Except the ones who ran from Him 
 To travel on their own 
 But He talked a lot of judgement 
 And you'll either rise or fall 
 You can call Him what you will 
 I call Him Lord of all!

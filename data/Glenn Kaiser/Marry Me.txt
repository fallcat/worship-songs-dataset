Call it old-fashioned, I don 
 t care 
 Call it anything you'd like, fair is fair 
 And I love you, and I need you 
 And this will never change 
 From the risin 
 of the sun till the daylight fades 
 Marry me, marry me, Wendi, marry me girl 
 I wanna live with you, I wanna die with you 
 Wanna know you now like I'll know you then 
 Wanna stay with you forever, wanna be with you 
 I'm not talkin 
 no one-night stand 
 And I'm not sayin 
 I'm some great find 
 But I want us together today, tomorrow, till the end 
 In spirit, in body, in soul, and in mind 
 Love is patient, love is kind 
 Love is what I want to rule my heart and my mind 
 Girl His love is what will see us through 
 Jesus' love for me and you 
 Marry me, marry me girl 
 I wanna stay with you forever 
 I wanna be with you

Maybe I'm in love with a memory 
 What once was true and real to me 
 Waves shapin' sand 
 Time like the sea 
 Maybe I'm in love with a memory 
 I used to wait for the morning dove 
 The lonesome cry at the break of dawn 
 City fumes and noises mostly fill my ears 
 Sirens and anger and wars that drain my tears 
 Sometimes I ponder what is to what used to be 
 Maybe I'm in love with a memory 
 Sometimes I ponder what is to what used to be 
 Maybe I'm in love with a memory 
 Lovin' until death do us part 
 The future of promises lost out at sea 
 Reachin' for a shadow in the dark 
 We can't return to what used to be 
 What I have learned under my skin 
 Is how we taste the sting of sin 
 I know the truth that Jesus sets one free 
 Each passing year it means more and more to me 
 I love Him more than what was or what will be 
 His love is more than a memory

Mercy came calling today, 
 God knows I needed to see her 
 Courage left me out in the lane, 
 Beat up and runnin' without her 
 She told me sit down, you made a mess of things 
 She was right 
 She said, you got to slow down, 
 Don' need ta stay out all night 
 Mercy 
 Mercy reached out, 
 Put her arms around me 
 Kissed me and seemed at home 
 I said don't leave me, looked in her eyes 
 She knows who I am an' knows what I done 
 Mercy came callin' today an' 
 I think it's the only way 
 I can sleep easy, or even sleep at all 
 Mercy came singing tonight, 
 She called me out to dance 
 Her sweet grace brought me delight, 
 It's so much more than romance 
 She took me right to it, 
 I didn't think I could do it 
 That old dragon's gone, mercy slew it 
 Oh mercy put her arms around me, 
 Kissed me, she seemed at home 
 I said don't leave me, I looked in her eyes, 
 She knows who I am an' she knows what I done 
 She forgives but she doesn't deceive me 
 Oh mercy don't leave me 
 The radio here by my bed doesn't ring anymore in my head 
 Mercy! 
 Mercy came callin' today, 
 God knows I needed to see her 
 She came callin' today, 
 God knows I needed to see her 
 Callin' today, oh callin' today, 
 Mercy came callin' today

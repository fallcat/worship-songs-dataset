I pledge my love to You more and more 
 I give my life to You every day 
 I pledge my soul to You, use me more and more 
 Take me where You will, only have Your way 
 Yes I know, You gave Your love to me 
 All You had, gave Your life for me 
 And I'm sure 
 Your thoughts are toward me, Lord, 
 I understand more and more 
 Your eyes looking out for me, and I know what for 
 For eternity, You and me I am sure 
 Break this heart of stone, don't wanna walk alone 
 The pain in my heart that You reached right through 
 The chain on my heart that You broke in two 
 Now I'm sure love's the cure 
 I pledge my love to You more and more 
 I give my life to You every day

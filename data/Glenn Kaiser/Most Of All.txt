I remember cold wind blowin' all across my face 
 A trace of frost would linger on my hair 
 As I wandered aimlessly from town to lonely town 
 Tryin' to shake my sadness and despair 
 And then I heard Him callin' me 
 Then I felt His tender love for me 
 And then finally I could see 
 That the sun had been shinin' all along 
 Oh, and I remember darkened streets 
 November's autumn leaves 
 They withered up and died every fall 
 But yet somehow I always hoped I'd live to see the spring 
 Your love was what I needed most of all 
 And if I didn't understand the searchin' in your hearts 
 I really couldn't sing this song at all 
 But Jesus knows just where you're at 
 And though you might gain the world 
 If you lose your soul then you have lost it all 
 If you lose your soul then you have lost it all 
 And then they nailed Him to a tree 
 And then He died, He died for you and me 
 But He is alive, and He wants to set you free 
 And all you've got to do is believe 
 Yes, all you've got to do is receive 
 Lord, Your love was what I needed most of all

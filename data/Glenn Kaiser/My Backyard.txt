I live in Chicago 
 On a cement street 
 People can be friendly 
 Or downright mean 
 Winos and call girls 
 The poor and refugees 
 It can get real interesting 
 Drive ya to your knees 
 Sometimes life ain't easy 
 It can be pretty hard 
 With the people 
 In my backyard 
 In my backyard 
 Old folks are lonely 
 Some people got AIDS 
 Some are just plain crazy 
 An' others full of rage 
 Young kid gang-bangin' 
 From a single parent 
 Gun in his pocket 
 Sellin' crack on his cell phone 
 So many homeless 
 Ain't got all their cards 
 That's the way it is 
 In my backyard 
 Oh, in my backyard 
 Suburban commuters 
 BMW or train 
 They come to get the money 
 A honey or cocaine 
 Some cops are crooked 
 Politicians on the take 
 Slumlords cuttin' deals 
 Robbin' widows by the lake 
 Orphans on the street 
 Family broken and charred 
 That's the way it is 
 In my backyard 
 In my backyard

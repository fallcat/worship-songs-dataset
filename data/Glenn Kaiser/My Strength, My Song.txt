He will not lead me 
 To temptation 
 He has never 
 Left me alone 
 He doesn't slumber 
 Or sleep 
 And forever 
 He is enthroned 
 His voice is 
 Like many waters 
 His angels 
 Watch over me 
 He is Father 
 To sons and daughters 
 And His Spirit 
 Sanctifies me 
 He overcame hell 
 To win me 
 He suffered death 
 Though He did no wrong 
 And His mercy is new 
 Every morning 
 He is my Strength 
 And my Song 
 All eyes 
 Will look upon Him 
 And every 
 Knee will bow 
 Every voice will cry 
 "Jesus is Lord" 
 He is coming 
 In the clouds

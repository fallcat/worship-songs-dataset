I rolled into your town 
 Saw the look in your eyes 
 So many times before 
 Hunger and thirst from the lies 
 Walk, day after day 
 Move, world in a daze 
 Just a mystery 
 Try, tryin' to stand 
 Still, under your skin 
 What, what is it worth? 
 This evil frustration you're in 
 Take back what you said 
 Face to face, what you done 
 It's a mystery 
 You been wounded 
 You been led astray 
 Locked out 
 Shut down 
 Blacked out in a terminal haze 
 But who made the choices 
 You just took what you could 
 Forgot all about 
 The nails in the wood 
 Try, try to crawl out 
 Heart, lonely and proud 
 Fear, of takin' the hit 
 Caught, so hard to quit 
 Mean, mean is the world 
 Hard, hard is the fall 
 Give it up, give it all 
 To the mystery 
 Give it up, give it all 
 Ain't no mystery

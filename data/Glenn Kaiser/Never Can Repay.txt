How can I expect I could repay 
 Love so true as what I feel today 
 Light of my world 
 Strength of my heart 
 You took the burden that tore me apart 
 God of all power 
 Love of my soul 
 Grace and such kindness 
 That I can't deserve 
 Life everlasting 
 Gifts I could not earn 
 God of all power 
 Love of my soul

He didn't promise you a Cadillac 
 He didn't say that you'd get paid back 
 He didn't tell you that you'd walk away 
 The lottery when times got fair 
 Keep seekin' and you will find 
 He'll meet your needs in the nick of time 
 He didn't promise no penthouse view 
 Perfect health or a pleasure cruise 
 No velvet Elvis or a Vegas show 
 No run o' luck at Lake Tahoe 
 But those who trust Him will be doin' fine 
 He'll meet your needs in the nick of time 
 He came to show us how to really live 
 He said, we're blessed when we freely give 
 He healed the sick and He raised the dead 
 Healed my brain when I was, outta my head 
 He feeds the sparrow, turns the water to wine 
 He'll meet your needs in the nick of time

I got a Bible in my home 
 I got a Bible in my home 
 If I don't read my soul be lost 
 Nobody's fault but mine 
 Sister, she taught me how to read 
 Sister, she taught me how to read 
 If I don't read my soul be lost 
 Nobody's fault but mine 
 Nobody's fault but mine 
 Jesus, He taught me how to walk 
 Jesus, He taught me how to walk 
 If I don't walk what Jesus taught 
 Nobody's fault but mine 
 People, they like someone to blame 
 People, they like someone to blame 
 But I can't play no blamin' game 
 Nobody's fault but mine

I thought I'd seen an angel 
 I should have looked away 
 But your honey-blond hair 
 And your sweet blue eyes 
 Were all you had to say 
 When a man is lonely 
 He sometimes drops his guard 
 I should have seen the headlights 
 I always lost at cards 
 They said you'd come from Rosedale 
 They said you'd had a fall 
 I'd just cleaned up 
 Had an empty cup 
 After wailin' at the wall 
 You smiled and reached 
 You didn't preach 
 But you took me where I'd been 
 God knows how 
 I could have missed 
 The sting of another sin 
 Then came the fight 
 In the moonless night 
 I had to quit the pain 
 So tonight I'm headin' northbound 
 On a southbound train 
 Northbound / goin' northbound 
 The sun is risin' slowly 
 As we reach the city's edge 
 It seems like it was years ago 
 Standin' on that ledge 
 Today I walk on water 
 In a gentle fallin' rain 
 She took all I never had 
 But my Savior took my shame 
 Sometimes it takes misery 
 To connect my heart and brain 
 So tonight I'm headin' northbound 
 On a southbound train 
 Oh, northbound / goin' northbound

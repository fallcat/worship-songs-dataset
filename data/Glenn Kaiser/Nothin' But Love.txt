I come to You with nothing to give 
 And I cannot ask for anything I 
 ve earned 
 I'm in need, yes it's true, for time and time again 
 I need more than a friend, 
 This I have learned from You 
 You took me in with nothing to give 
 Drawing near to me with nothing but love 
 I took Your hand learning to walk and to stand 
 Hearing Your heart call to me with nothing but love 
 I expect some pain and grief 
 And at times that's what's come to me 
 'Cause we reap what we sow, an' everybody knows 
 But You wait, just to forgive 
 You tell me to choose life and live 
 And I see it and hear it and feel it so often I know 
 You take me in with not one thing to give 
 And in times when the weather is rough 
 Your grace is shelter enough

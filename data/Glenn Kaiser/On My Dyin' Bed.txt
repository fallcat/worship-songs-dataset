Wind came up with a howl an' moan 
 Wind came up with a howl an' moan 
 Mighty Wind Sure an' I should have known 
 Come my angel take me up an' on 
 Ain't no power that can hold me down 
 On to glory to my heavenly home 
 Oh, Lord on my dyin' bed 
 On to Jesus, wanna see your face 
 Great God Almighty amazing grace! 
 Home to heaven 
 See your face 
 Come to meet me 
 On my dyin' bed

Today I rose on our anniversary 
 Readied myself for the day 
 Gave thanks for twenty-six years with you 
 My faithful, my beautiful, and brave 
 Considered so many we have known 
 Wondering where they might be now 
 Whose eyes grew dim, whose hearts decreased 
 Withdrew their hands from the plow 
 Yet I know no other Saviour 
 He has given me no other call 
 I can serve no other Master 
 And I thank God you walk with me still 
 One more step on the road to glory 
 One more day on the path 
 One more mile in the grip of mercy 
 In the only love that lasts 
 I place my hand on the Book of fools 
 I pledge my life to its truth 
 Wendi, many are called; few are chosen 
 Let two of them be me an' you 
 We've spent time in the colosseum 
 Among lions of another kind 
 Those who forgive have learned to live 
 And the blind stumble the blind 
 You and I know the secret 
 That no secrets exist at all 
 Where the love in the nails secures release 
 From the Judas who bids us, "Fall 
 It's just one more step on the road to glory 
 One more day on the narrow path 
 One more mile in His grace and mercy 
 In the only love that lasts 
 One more step on the road to glory 
 One more day on the path 
 One more chapter in the story 
 Of the only love that lasts 
 There's a little more grey than yesterday 
 I hope to wear it well 
 There are two young ladies an' two prodigals 
 Worth every tear that fell 
 And a family on Wilson Avenue 
 That grows in knowledge and in grace 
 There are names in a book before the throne 
 I am satisfied they won't be erased 
 And if I had a second chance 
 To choose all over again 
 I'd take Jesus and you in a second 
 And I'll walk with you both 'til the end

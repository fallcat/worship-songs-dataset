Ronnie took a look in his wallet 
 Patty took a look in the mirror 
 Saturday night only comes once a week 
 He went to a club to meet her 
 Not afraid of the weather 
 Engine jus' purred like a kitten 
 Knocked back a few, they got real loose 
 They never knew what hit 'em (2x) 
 No no 
 Susie pops her pills 
 She's chasin' perfection 
 An' just when she thinks she's catchin' up 
 It goes in the wrong direction 
 Now she's up on a table 
 Betrayed by her own voice 
 Deceived by a fable 
 An' now she's got no choice 
 She ain't got no choice 
 Out cold in the middle 
 Two lanes goin' separate ways 
 Dumbstruck by the riddle 
 Hair trigger always acts that way 
 Sammy knows it's a poison 
 Still he likes it poppin' up his nose 
 Streets reek with these lessons 
 Stone dead in the august snow 
 Fast lane tonight 
 Cold slab in the mornin' 
 Honey, out go the lights 
 Cause an' effect 
 It don't give warnin'

Tell me if you ever saw 
 A field of unripe wheat 
 Thirsting in the summer sun 
 Withered in the tortured heat 
 Tell me if you ever heard 
 The thunder of the storm 
 Or felt the sting of hailstones 
 The wheat fields smashed and torn 
 Tell me if you ever watched 
 A fire consume the grain 
 And smelled the smoke-filled sky 
 A black/blue angry stain 
 Tell me if you ever wept 
 Over remnants of the spring 
 So much planted, so little left 
 Love nothing left to bring 
 Plant the seed again 
 Plant the seed again 
 Plant the seed again 
 No way of knowing but to believe... 
 Plant the seed again

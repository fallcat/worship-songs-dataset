Once bitten, twice shy 
 Eye for an eye can leave you blind 
 Unforgiveness, me oh my 
 That ol' me, myself, and I 
 Gossip in the courtroom, 
 Singin' in the choir 
 Prepare, prepare to get burned 
 If you play with fire 
 Watch what you plant 
 Watch what you do 
 Sowin' and reapin' 
 Comin' back on you 
 Talk too much, 
 Everybody says 
 Like a career 
 Reap it all in the end 
 It's right to be careful 
 Respect what God says 
 Cause Jesus will come 
 To judge the quick and the dead 
 Wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord 
 Love for my neighbor the end of discord 
 Everybody's fightin' for a piece of pie 
 But the oven is smokin' and there's tears in the eyes 
 God is true, 
 Though every man's wrong 
 Pretend we don't get it 
 That's just playin' with fire 
 Sit in the back room, 
 Call truth a lie 
 Prepare to get burned 
 If you're playin' with fire 
 Talk too much, 
 Everybody says 
 Like a career 
 Reap it all in the end 
 Sit in the back room, 
 Livin' a lie 
 Prepare to get burned 
 If you're playin' with fire

I saw new England fall in the autumn 
 Professing themselves wise 
 They learned to be fools 
 I saw the picture-postcards and the majesty 
 And it died 
 If ever there was a key 
 To wisdom and knowledge 
 It is the cornerstone rejected by the world 
 If ever was a people so removed from absolutes 
 Absolutely 
 I heard the depth and height of information 
 Served on steaming tables of speculation 
 I understood the rite of education 
 For the sake of the elite 
 If ever there was a reason 
 It was love 
 If ever any person personified that love 
 It was Jesus 
 I heard the shot heard 'round the campus 
 It was the deification of humanity 
 One that had ceased to be human 
 One who pretended to be God 
 And I recalled another ruler 
 In the autumn of another time and place 
 He refused to give God the glory 
 And like dying leaves 
 In a cold cold land 
 Eaten up and died

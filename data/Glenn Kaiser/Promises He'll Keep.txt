If you mourn, 
 You will be comforted 
 If you're gentle, 
 The earth is yours 
 If you hunger and thirst for righteousness 
 You shall be satisfied 
 Oh, you shall be satisfied 
 If you're merciful, 
 It will come back to you 
 Pure in heart, you will see God 
 If you make peace, 
 Peace you sall know 
 You'll be called the sons of God 
 You will be called the sons of God 
 Blessed are you: persecuted 
 Because of His rightouesness 
 Yours is the kingdom of heaven 
 The kingdom of heaven is yours 
 If the people insult you 
 If they lie about your life 
 Rejoice and be glad 
 Your reward is great 
 Kept for you safe in heaven 
 Kept for you safe in His hands

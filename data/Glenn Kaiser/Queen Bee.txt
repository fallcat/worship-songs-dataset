Up this mornin' goin' to New York City 
 Comin' through my second cup 
 Got nothin' but respect for my sweet home darlin' 
 Always puts the cream in my stuff 
 She blesses me so that I just can't stand it 
 I know that I don't deserve 
 This woman called wife is the love of my life 
 Love that God'll preserve 
 Ah, she's my queen (4x) 
 She's my queen bee 
 She's my queen bee 
 She's my queen bee 
 She's my queen bee baby an' she treats me 
 Like a king 
 Late night music in my stumblin' hour 
 Spring in my step durin' mean rush hour 
 Uptown lady with a heart o' gold 
 Nothing could be better in the winter cold 
 Than my queen (etc.) 
 My queen 
 She knows she's my queen 
 I bow to my queen 
 She's my queen bee, people 
 God made her sweet as can be 
 My my-rockin' ...

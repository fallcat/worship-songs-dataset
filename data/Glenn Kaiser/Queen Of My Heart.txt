I'm tellin' you somethin', I'm tellin' you now 
 I got a love like the world won't allow 
 It came wrapped in a woman made for me an' me alone 
 God sent her to me sure as He is on the throne 
 Her an' me followin' the Savior from the start 
 He's the King of my life and she is the queen of my heart 
 Honey, you're good for me, I think I'm good for you 
 Together we'll make sweet harmony too 
 We'll walk in the light, we'll follow the Son 
 And when we leave this world it will have only just begun 
 You and me followin' the Saviour from the start 
 He's the King of my life, oh and you are the queen of my heart

Talkin' to myself Idea and images covered with dust 
 Memories well-worn from contant use 
 Stained by loneliness and lust. 
 Heaping, on my heart abuse. 
 Somebody tell me, what's the use? 
 Somebody tell me, Somebody tell me what's the use? 
 Wet-walking in streaming rain 
 Hair stuck to my head like my thoughts. 
 Regrets half-felt and sin half-loved, 
 What I have bought? 
 Drops coming down on my face, and on the root tops 
 But they don't reach inside me, 
 I say faith is just for fools. 
 Somebody tell me What's the use? 
 Love cold and wet against my skin, 
 Where do you end how do you begin. 
 I'm so lost in a world without Your breath 
 Afraid of being touched without tenderness. 
 Needing Your fire Fearing your flame 
 Should I surrender Waiting for the rain 
 Streaming rain Come rain 
 Lord send Your rain, rain, rain rain rain

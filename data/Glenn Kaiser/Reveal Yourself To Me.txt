Send the glory of Your presence 
 Down, now, here 
 Send the glory of Your majesty 
 Down, now, here 
 Send the glory of Your mercy 
 Down, now, here 
 Without You we can do nothing 
 Nothing at all 
 But in You Who are mighty 
 We can walk and not fall 
 Send the glory of Your power 
 Down, now, here 
 Send the glory of Your innocence 
 Down, now, here 
 Send the glory of Your holiness 
 Down, now, here 
 Reveal Yourself to me!

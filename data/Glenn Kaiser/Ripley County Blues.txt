Oh, Amos is a poor man, 
 His woman died in '72 
 Got three sons, and a bottle 
 Nothin' else, except the blues 
 That ol' whipporwill song 
 Filters in through his haze 
 Near extinct in a roadway 
 Life for Amos, is a maze 
 It's a poor, poor county 
 People don't complain 
 Livin' what they know 
 Some like Able, some like Cain 
 Red clay in Ripley County 
 As thick as it has ever been 
 Some more drought keeps on rollin' 
 Just like Amos, and his kin 
 Only two roads he can walk down 
 One is righteous, one is sin 
 There's plenty of the Good Book, 
 In the church and radio 
 Good news, ain't a mystery 
 Ain't like Amos, doesn't know 
 That ol' clay in Ripley County 
 Thick as it has ever been 
 On the back road by the neighbors 
 Perhaps it's time that I stop in

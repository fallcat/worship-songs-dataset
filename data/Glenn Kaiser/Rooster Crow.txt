What did you say, what did you do 
 When they asked you who are you 
 Did you tell 'em Who you know 
 Did you hear that rooster crow 
 How will you answer and where will you go 
 Did you hear that rooster crow 
 In the alley, in the street 
 In the schoolyard, do you take the heat 
 Did you hide it-Who do you know 
 Did you hear that rooster crow 
 You say you're walkin' that calvary road 
 But are you lettin' everybody know 
 Does your light shine, does it show 
 Or do you hear that rooster crow

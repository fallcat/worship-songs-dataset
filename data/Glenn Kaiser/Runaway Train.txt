Saw smokestack lightnin' 
 Heard clickety-clack 
 Lord, it was frightenin' 
 Comin' down that track 
 How I went runnin' 
 Took the short way home 
 That train man gunnin' 
 Off his iron throne 
 Oh, blowin' in the night 
 Eyes wide open 
 Sin in broad daylight 
 Swallow, till you're chokin' 
 Sowed all the oats 
 Up came the wheat 
 I thought I smelled sulfur 
 From all my deeds 
 I wanted pleasure 
 Didn't worry how 
 Up came the mirror 
 Out came a howl 
 It came at daybreak 
 That darkness fled 
 I heard the whistle inside my head 
 Roared right through town 
 Like the 6:15 
 Straight down that track 
 Like I had never seen 
 Sun rose like lightnin' 
 An' roun' my brain 
 Saw some kinda shadow 
 Leave the rails 
 I wanted pleasure 
 Didn't worroy how 
 Up came the mirror 
 Out came a howl 
 Roared right through town 
 Like the 6:15 
 Straight down that track 
 Like I had never seen 
 Jus' like a runaway train

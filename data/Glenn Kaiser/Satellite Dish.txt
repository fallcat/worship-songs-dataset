Some kinda fool stuck aluminum foil 
 On my satellite dish (2x) 
 He ruined a perfect evening 
 "Wheel of Fortune"'s what I missed 
 Had a new Mercedes 
 With them patent leather seats (2x) 
 Drunken driver on the freeway 
 Pulled my ride up in a heap 
 They said your treasure's where your heart is 
 My treasure started out nice an' green (2x) 
 Till my wife ran my waller 
 Through her washin machine 
 Ah ya can't take it with you 
 Better use it while you can (2x) 
 But understand you'll have to answer 
 To the One who put it all in your hand

It's the thing I lack most and it puts me in a bind 
 The wise possess it, it brings them peace of mind 
 Down in my soul, I need self-control 
 Without it my mouth says terrible things 
 Without it my hands work selfishness 
 When it's lacking so do those that we love most 
 Without it nobody wins, but everyone knows 
 Down in our soul, we need self-control 
 In my younger days, I didn 
 t understand 
 Surrendering myself was part of the plan 
 Without giving it over, we can't receive 
 All there is, all He has, for you and for me 
 We need self-control 
 It's the way of the Spirit and everyone knows 
 That revealing moment when it all seems to flow 
 Ain 
 t none of us have enough, but everyone sees 
 That without it we steadily move 
 From need to greed, 
 Down in our souls we know we need self-control

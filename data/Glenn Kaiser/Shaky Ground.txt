I thought I'd been liv'n in the light of day 
 I though I'd been redeemed 
 I prayed my preayers but I went my way 
 Liv'n just like I'd been 
 Stand'n 
 Stand'n on shaky ground 
 He'd gone to the church all of his life 
 He'd heard what the preacheer said 
 But the life he lived did him no good 
 The truth simply filled his head 
 Chorus [repeat 3Ã—] 
 I thought I'd been liv'n in the light of day 
 I though I'd been redeemed 
 I prayed my preayers but I went my way 
 Liv'n just like I'd been

Some fires burn so brightly 
 But in a short time they grow so cold 
 In the actions of a Christian 
 Love shines pure as tested gold 
 Fiction is fiction 
 But a fact, baby, ain't no lie 
 When you can look God in the face 
 You can look your neighbor in the eye 
 Father take me by degrees 
 Take me any way you please 
 I'm not my own 
 Got eternity to love you 
 In the light all around your throne 
 Don't need no reputation 
 Earthly glory'll leave you cold 
 Live an' learn 
 It's like kissin' through a windowpane 
 Pretendin it's true love 
 Live an' learn 
 A love that lasts eternally 
 That's what I want 
 A slow burn

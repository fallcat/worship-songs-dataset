Spontaneous combustion 
 Lord, you set my heart aflame 
 Salted in the fire 
 Lord you set my heart aflame 
 Burnin' sacrifices 
 Yeah - where every loss is gain 
 Spontaneous combustion 
 Like a house of livin' stones 
 No wood or hay or stubble 
 Just the pure before your throne 
 A love that never quits 
 Yes where heaven is my home 
 Spontaneous combustion 
 Spirit shakin' me inside 
 A holy band of angels 
 Campin' round on every side 
 Comin' for a wedding 
 For a true and spotless bride

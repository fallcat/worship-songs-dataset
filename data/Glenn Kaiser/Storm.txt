Rain pourin' down my shirt, 
 We all need a place to be 
 Ain't nothin' for us here no more, 
 If we got eyes to see 
 But the heavens are cryin' out 
 All night long to the morn 
 Hold us close, close within this storm 
 Wasn't money that we needed, 
 Or friends that we could trust 
 Wasn't food on the table, none of this came first 
 You need a hope beyond ourselves, 
 A reason for it all 
 Read the paper, see the pain, 
 See the backs against the wall 
 Livin' in a storm 
 Storm pourin' over me, 
 I need ears to hear and eyes to see 
 You got to recognize 
 The substance from the form, 
 This world is deep in trouble, 
 And I think I know what's real 
 Jesus hold us closer in this storm 
 Closer, closer, within this storm

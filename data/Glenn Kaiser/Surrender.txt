Holy Father, as we stand before Your throne 
 As we look upon Your face 
 We confess Your matchless grace 
 Lord and Savior, we have nothing without You 
 There is nothing we can do 
 But to serve and follow You 
 And surrender 
 And surrender 
 To surrender 
 All our dreams 
 All we are 
 All that we are to become 
 All our love

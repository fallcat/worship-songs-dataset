Take a stand, take a stand, take a stand 
 If I never see you anymore 
 Take a stand, take a stand, take a stand 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore 
 Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me 
 If I never see you anymore 
 Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore 
 Shake my hand, shake my hand, shake my hand 
 If I never ever see you anymore 
 Shake my hand, shake my hand, shake my hand 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore 
 Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith 
 If I never see you anymore 
 Keep the faith, keep the faith, keep the faith 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore 
 Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth 
 If I never see you anymore 
 Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore 
 Preach the Word, preach the Word, preach the Word 
 If I never see you anymore 
 Preach the Word, preach the Word, preach the Word 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore 
 Run the race, run the race, run the race 
 If I never see you anymore 
 Run the race, run the race, run the race 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore 
 Take your stand, take your stand, take your stand 
 If I never see you anymore 
 Take your stand, take your stand, take your stand 
 And I will meet you 
 On the Kingdom's shore

As ocean waves are to the shore 
 As gentle rains to the sea 
 As starlight on the waters 
 So you are to me 
 We shall scale the mountains 
 Conquer the valleys too 
 Come wind, come rain, come Jesus 
 His love will see us through 
 Master Weaver, use us well 
 Two lives You weave as one 
 Oh, make of us a tapestry 
 In which Your beauty runs 
 In which Your beauty runs 
 Today you rose to greet me 
 As the daylight awoke the dawn 
 Our love is just beginning 
 But shall go on and on

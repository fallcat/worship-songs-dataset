Love don't force you to accept the truth 
 Love ain't just about use and abuse 
 Love is patient, love is kind 
 The world is burnin' for this love of mine 
 You don't wanna listen to a word I say 
 You don't wanna face 
 Your own judgment day 
 You don't wanna know 
 What comes from above 
 But all I wanna talk about is His love 
 I didn't start it-I tell you no lie 
 Love rose three days from when it died 
 Yes He did 
 Well, people walkin' around like animals 
 People hurtin' people like criminals 
 We build a jail and lock ourselves in 
 You either got love or original sin 
 I can't contain it-Oh, I tell you no lie 
 Love rose three days from when He died 
 Yeah, yeah!

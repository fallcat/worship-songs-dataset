Climbing to the top of your favorite ladder 
 Strainin' and sweatin' to achieve that goal 
 Years later question how you missed what mattered 
 You ride that road-you gotta pay that toll 
 Man on the phone he's askin' about 
 The state of the American dream 
 We buy out, trade down, sell our souls, 
 And finally wonder what it all means, yeah, 
 What's it all mean? 
 If you could catch that fish and reel 'er in 
 If you could sit on the throne 
 And really be king 
 If you had ears to hear you might consider one thing 
 Are you throwin' away what's real, 
 Tradin' for a brass ring 
 One test. 
 Are you a slave to your own definition of happiness? 
 Climbin' to the top of your favorite ladder 
 Years later question how you missed what mattered 
 Ride that road-you gotta pay that toll 
 Climbin' to the top of your favorite ladder 
 Years later question how you missed what mattered 
 Ya ride that road-you gotta pay that toll

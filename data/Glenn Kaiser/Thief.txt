Like a shot in the dark, 
 Like a smokin' gun 
 When you least expect, 
 That's when He's gonna come 
 No angel of light, 
 No man from the east 
 Gonna stand Him up 
 When time has ceased 
 God Almighty, nobody gonna sleep 
 When the stars fall down, 
 He'll be comin' like a thief 
 When they talk of peace 
 And there just ain't none 
 When the sand runs out 
 Though knowledge increase 
 In the blink of an eye, like a lightnin' strike 
 From the east to the west 
 Like a thief in the night 
 Lord, Lord, they gonna wail an' weep 
 Aw, when the clouds roll back 
 He'll be comin' like a thief, comin' like a thief 
 Two in the field, one won't go 
 Two in bed, one left lyin' cold 
 Two in the factory, one punchin' out 
 With the blast of a horn, with a mighty shout 
 Gonna reap, just like a field of wheat 
 Oh, ya better watch an' pray 
 He'll be comin' like a thief, comin' like a thief

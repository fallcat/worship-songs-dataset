This Child is unlike any other you have known 
 This Child is destined to the homeless and the throne 
 This Child is for the risin' and fallin' of us all 
 This Child, this Jesus, He cries and He calls 
 This Lamb born into a cruel and calloused world 
 This Lamb among the poor and the outcast as a pearl 
 This Lamb fully loved and fully hated by name 
 This holy, spotless Lamb bears our sorrow and our shame 
 The King of kings, the Lord of lords 
 The Wisdom and the Knowledge of God 
 The Everlasting Father 
 The Son of Righteousness 
 The Prince of Peace, possesses me and all that I possess 
 (Repeat first verse)

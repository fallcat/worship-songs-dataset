Ice in my veins, snow in my bed 
 Pain in my heart 
 An' a ache in my head 
 Got to know if I'll 
 Ever get warm again 
 When it's three below zero and 
 The cold is your only friend 
 Spent myself, 
 Gave myself away 
 To the highest bidder, and only hell to pay 
 I didn't care, I didn't, 
 I didn't have no one 
 And when it's three below zero 
 An' the clouds cover up the sun 
 When the fire's out, and the house is dark 
 In the freezin' night 
 Just a lonely dog bark- 
 Feelin' helpless an' you just got to pray 
 When it's three below zero 
 And you need to see the light of day 
 Yeah ... 
 Now I found the fire, 
 Witness of Your love to me 
 My face in Your mind and 
 Condemnation just a memory 
 Yeah, fire in my heart 
 And blood on a cold dark tree 
 But if you wonder 
 If you'll ever get warm again 
 When it's three below zero, 
 You got to find yourself 
 The warmth of my Friend 
 So when it's three below zero 
 You got to find yourself 
 The warmth of my Friend

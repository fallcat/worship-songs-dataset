There was a time, there was a season 
 I did not know my left from my right 
 And all I wanted baby 
 Was to just get through the night 
 Too many clouds, fog in the daytime 
 Took so long for me to see the light 
 And all I ever wanted 
 Was to make it through the night 
 Though I had eyes, I could not see 
 Though I could walk, I stumbled blind 
 Until you came and rescued me 
 Lord, the world can be so unkind 
 There was a day, there was a vision 
 It came and I finally got my sight 
 God of mercy 
 You brought me safely through the night

Throw down your crowns before His throne 
 On holy ground He makes you His own 
 All must bow down before Him alone 
 Our God is worth to be praised 
 Lift up your hands, don't be afraid 
 For His good pleasure we have been made 
 His heart's desire that we'd be saved to worship 
 Jesus who is raised 
 Offer your life it's all you can give 
 Reckon your all only a gift 
 He gave His life that we might live in Jesus 
 Worthy of all praise 
 Worthy is, Holy is, Jesus is his Name 
 Master is, Savior is, Jesus is His Name

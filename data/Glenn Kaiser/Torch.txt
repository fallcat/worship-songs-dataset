Well I'm carryin' a torch 
 Carryin' a torch from above 
 I'm carryin' the torch, Lord 
 Carryin' a torch from above 
 I got good, good news 
 Ain't nothin' gonna stop this love 
 Oh, there's a fire in my bones 
 There's a flame in my heart, got to give 
 Fire in my bones 
 Got such a love to give 
 Oh, the stone rolled away 
 We can live because He lives 
 He lives 
 (Carryin' a torch for ya) 
 I'm alive by Your kindness 
 Yeah I am healed by the gift of faith 
 Filled with Your fire 
 I am livin' in mercy and grace 
 I'm as sure as can be 
 One day I'm gonna see Your face 
 See Your face 
 Carryin' a torch 
 Of Your love 
 Carryin' the torch 
 Torch of Your love

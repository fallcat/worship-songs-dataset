Uptown, downtown, all around 
 You can see it in their faces 
 In a '71 Chevy with the big mag wheels 
 We was crusin' the concrete, we was lookin' for deals 
 When in the rear view mirror what do ya think that we saw? 
 The long blue arm of the law 
 On a street called Desire in a town called Sin 
 We was lookin' for action and we found it again 
 There was a piece on the table, had to split on the double 
 'Cause I was starin' at the business end of trouble 
 Every time has a purpose, every night has a day 
 And the daylight is better than those night time ways 
 Over my head in danger, buried under the rubble 
 I had been starin' at the business end of trouble 
 Don't like bein' in trouble 
 Lord, you took me outta trouble

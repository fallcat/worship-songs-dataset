Me an' my brother, hot dusty day 
 Pickin 
 peas from the vine 
 Where the honey bees play 
 Stealin 
 fresh fruit from the garden out there 
 Never a worry and never a care 
 But it didn 
 t stay that way in my troubled world 
 Deliverin 
 papers in the city heat 
 I heard the cry of the jungle, 
 Stingin' lead an' concrete 
 They were screamin 
 for justice, burnin 
 downtown 
 I felt the frustration comin 
 fast and loud 
 But it didn 
 t stay that way in my troubled world 
 I marched and I shouted, I listened and thought 
 Surrendered to despair an' the drugs I bought 
 Buyin 
 and sellin 
 a world of pain 
 Tried to take my life in a winter's rain 
 But it didn 
 t stay that way in my troubled world 
 Somebody told me when I was young 
 That this troubled world was honestly loved 
 Bought and paid for by a Sacrifice 
 My innocence lost, my soul on ice 
 What a cruel cruel joke, what a great mistake 
 Of the lonely years and the mess I made 
 And that night I cried and I named that name 
 For He loved me so though we'd been so estranged 
 But it didn 
 t stay that way in my troubled world 
 Glad to say it didn 
 t stay that way 
 In my troubled world

Nobody lives forever 
 In the twinkling of an eye 
 We think we're here forever 
 I sure don't know why 
 But don't it seem to you 
 We still got lots to do 
 Things get piled so high 
 Till they cover up the sky 
 Can I get a witness? 
 We got unfinished business ... 
 The saddest thing of all 
 The thing that ya should have done 
 The baddest way to fall 
 Is to stumble as you run 
 You hear His voice so clear 
 Ya know just what to do 
 No love is quite so dear 
 As one that's tried and true 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Got unfinished business ... 
 If you love you will obey 
 If you live just what you say 
 Trust in His forgiveness 
 You don't need to leave 
 No unfinished business

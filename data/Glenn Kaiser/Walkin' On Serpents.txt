Got my head together, got my mind made up 
 Got love forever, made the final cut 
 Got life support, got eternal aid 
 Had enough of bein' pushed around 
 Makin' lemonade 
 Start to walk, start to stand 
 Start to livin' like a natural man 
 I know what's real an' I know what's right 
 And I know the power of Jesus in my life 
 A thousand may fall at my side, 
 But it will not come near me 
 Ten thousand may fall at my right side, 
 But unless it's God's will, it will not come near me 
 Been walkin' on serpents, been walkin' on scorpions 
 Over all of the power of the enemy 
 A double-minded soul is totally unstable 
 One hand on the plow while lookin' back 
 They are driven by the wind and tossed in the waves 
 While the single-minded, wholehearted follower won't lack

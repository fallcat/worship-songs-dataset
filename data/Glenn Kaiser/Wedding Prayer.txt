Father, our Father 
 Grant us Thy peace 
 Release us in Thy Spirit 
 That we may increase 
 In the love that Thou hast worked in us 
 As man and wife 
 We receive Thy blessing 
 As the three of us unite 
 God, make us one in Thy glory 
 In Jesus we depend alone 
 Use us to proclaim 
 Salvation in Thy name 
 We invite you to be Lord of our home

Where would I be without your great, great mercy 
 Where would I be without your deep, deep love 
 Where would I go without your light to lead me 
 Oh my Lord, oh my Lord 
 My Lord and my God 
 What would I do without your great, great mercy 
 Where would I go without your deep, deep love 
 Where would I live outside your forgiveness 
 Without the risen Son 
 Where would I be?

Wind me up or take me right down 
 Rock me in Your sweet embrace, 
 Cause my heart to pound 
 Fill me with the holy joy, take me to my knees 
 It's all all right, I'll walk where You walk with me 
 Blessed my soul with the light of life 
 My God I can't conceal 
 You took my heart of stone 
 You made my heart to feel 
 You are my day and night 
 You are my Sacrifice 
 And You're real 
 Start me up, Lord, cause me to stand 
 So when the storm clouds hit 
 I ain't holdin' on to sinkin' sand 
 You're comin' back, keep me lookin' up 
 In Your sweet sweet grace 
 Keep remindin' us of Your love

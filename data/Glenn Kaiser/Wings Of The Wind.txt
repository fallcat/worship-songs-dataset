Praise the Lord O my soul 
 O Lord my God 
 You are very great 
 You are clothed in splendor and majesty 
 He wraps Himself in the light 
 Stretches the heavens out 
 And He lays the beams of His chambers on the waters 
 He makes the clouds His chariots 
 And He rides on the wings of the wind 
 He makes the winds His messengers 
 And flames of fire His servants 
 He set the earth in it's place 
 It can never be moved 
 And He covered it with the deep 
 As with a garment 
 I will sing to the Lord 
 All of my life 
 I will sing praise to my God for as long as I live

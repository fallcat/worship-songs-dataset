Lord, it's cold outside tonight 
 How I wish, Lord, the light should come 
 So cold outside, 
 Lord, I wish 
 That the light 
 Would come 
 At the break of day 
 I'll feel the winter sun 
 I was far away, far away, far away 
 So far away 
 Felt like ice ran right through my veins 
 Far away 
 Felt like ice ran through my veins 
 Stumblin' through the night 
 Blind and stuck to a ball and chain 
 Lord, it's cold outside tonight 
 How I wish for the light to come 
 Cold outside, Lord, 
 I wish that the light would come 
 At the break of day I'll feel the winter sun 
 Daylight roll 
 Daylight come 
 Set my heart ablaze 
 In the warmth of Your winter sun 
 I was far away 
 Felt like ice 
 Ran right through my veins 
 Far away felt like ice ran through my veins 
 Stumblin' through the night blind 
 Stuck to a ball an' chain 
 Tumblin' down on hard cold ground 
 Nothin' could heal my pain 
 Blown by the wind in sorrow and sin 
 Sick in the freezin' rain 
 Daylight roll / Daylight take my shame

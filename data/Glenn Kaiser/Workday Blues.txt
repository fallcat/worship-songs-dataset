Friday night, all the people prowl 
 Rolled up tight, like a dog they howl 
 Monday mornin', it begins again 
 Livin' dry till the weekend 
 Goin' down, they're victims of the workday blues 
 Sweet Sunday, they're too tired to pray 
 Too self seekin', they hide away 
 Monday mornin', it begins again 
 Livin' with nothin' till the weekend 
 Goin' down, they're victims of the workday blues 
 Cheap satisfaction ain't there on demand 
 Lookin' cross-eyed at the Son of man 
 Some are just lazy, some want a hand, not a heart 
 It's frustratin' when the job is so hard 
 But nothin' is impossible with my sweet Lord 
 Some live like there ain't no truth they can choose 
 There's gonna be judgement day blues 
 Monday mornin', victims of the workday blues 
 There ain't no doubt, they're victims of the workday blues 
 Ain't no good neglectin', the love and truth and good news 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 The workday blues

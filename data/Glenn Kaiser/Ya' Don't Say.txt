Child, you don't say much 
 Maybe ain't got much to say 
 You sing about boys and girls 
 Seem to like bein' up on the stage 
 Perhaps just a little too young 
 Maybe just a bit afraid 
 Or maybe it's a case of fantasy thrill 
 Maybe just wanna get paid 
 But ya' don't say much 
 Words are important to you 
 You like to hold tight to the truth 
 But fun means more sometimes 
 It's an interesting habit I find 
 From the mouth we reveal our heart 
 And singin' ain't only an art 
 We need to think about the things we say 
 Life isn't only for play 
 Some folks are so out of touch 
 Because you don't say much 
 But ya' sure like to play guitar... 
 Heaven, hell, or this earth 
 There's somethin' 'bout value and worth 
 Actions speak louder than words 
 But hidin' God's truth is absurd 
 No matter what the rational hush 
 Aw ya' don't say much

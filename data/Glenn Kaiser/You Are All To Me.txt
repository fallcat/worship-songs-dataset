You are all to me 
 You are all to me 
 You formed the land and the rolling sea 
 You are my God and You're all to me 
 Who scattered stars across the sky 
 Who caused the sun and moon to shine 
 Who makes the desert a life-giving spring? 
 Who but the Lord on high? 
 It is our Father's good pleasure 
 To share His kingdom and love 
 Come to the Source of all holy joy 
 Come to the throne of God

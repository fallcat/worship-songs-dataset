Some mornin 
 s it comes to me with the break of day 
 Sometimes at the high noon with the sun so bright 
 Some late afternoon times when the sun sets low 
 Some evenin 
 s when the whippoorwill sings 
 In the sweet moonlight 
 You make me happy when You call my name 
 You make me happy, sunshine or rain 
 You make me happy, feel you all around 
 Someday I'm gonna see You 
 When the glory comes down 
 Some days come rougher in the heat of pain 
 Some days come easier, but all the same 
 When I feel Your love right with me 
 I can work through anything 
 That this life brings my way 
 'Cause You make me happy when You call my name 
 You make me happy whether sun or rain 
 You make me happy 'cause You're all around 
 Someday I will see You in Your golden crown 
 Lord, with You there is everlasting joy 
 I'm so glad that You made me Your own 
 I got the grace, every breath I take 
 Jesus, Jesus, You never make no mistake 
 And I'll tell Ya, I'm glad You're on the throne

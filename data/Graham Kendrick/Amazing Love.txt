My Lord what love is this 
 That pays so dearly 
 That I, the guilty one may go free 
 Amazing love, o what sacrifice 
 The Son of God given for me 
 My debt He pays and my death He dies 
 That I might live 
 That I might live 
 And so they watched Him die 
 Despised, rejected 
 But oh, the blood He shed flowed for me 
 And now this love of Christ 
 Shall flow like rivers 
 Come wash your guilt away, live again

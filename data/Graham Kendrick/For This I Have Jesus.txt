For the joys and for the sorrows 
 The best and worst of times 
 For this moment, for tomorrow 
 For all that lies behind 
 Fears that crowd around me 
 For the failure of my plans 
 For the dreams of all I hope to be 
 The truth of what I am 
 For this I have Jesus 
 For this I have Jesus 
 For this I have Jesus, I have Jesus 
 (Repeat) 
 For the tears that flow in secret 
 In the broken times 
 For the moments of elation 
 Or the troubled mind 
 For all the disappointments 
 Or the sting of old regrets 
 All my prayers and longings 
 That seem unanswered yet 
 For the weakness of my body 
 The burdens of each day 
 For the nights of doubt and worry 
 When sleep has fled away 
 Needing reassurance 
 And the will to start again 
 A steely-eyed endurance 
 The strength to fight and win

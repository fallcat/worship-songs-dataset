God is great, amazing! 
 Come, let his praises ring 
 God is great, astounding! 
 The whole creation sings 
 His clothing is splendour and majesty bright 
 For He wraps himself in a garment of light 
 He spreads out the heavens, his palace of stars 
 And rides on the wings of the wind 
 What marvellous wisdom the Maker displays 
 The sea vast and spacious, the dolphins and whales 
 The earth full of creatures, the great and the small 
 He watches and cares for them all 
 The rain forest canopies darken the skies 
 Cathedrals of mist that resound with the choirs 
 Of creatures discordant, outrageous, ablaze 
 In colourful pageants of praise 
 Above his creation the Father presides 
 The pulse of the planets, the rhythm of tides 
 The moon marks the seasons, the day follows night 
 Yet he knows every beat of my heart 
 Let cannons of thunder salute their acclaim 
 The sunsets fly glorious banners of flame 
 The angels shout 'holy' again and again 
 As they soar in the arch of the heavens

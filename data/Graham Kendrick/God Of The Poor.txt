Beauty for brokenness 
 Hope for despair 
 Lord, in your suffering 
 This is our prayer 
 Bread for the children 
 Justice, joy, peace 
 Sunrise to sunset 
 Your kingdom increase! 
 Shelter for fragile lives 
 Cures for their ills 
 Work for the craftsman 
 Trade for their skills 
 Land for the dispossessed 
 Rights for the weak 
 Voices to plead the cause 
 Of those who can't speak 
 Friend of the weak 
 Give us compassion we pray 
 Melt our cold hearts 
 Let tears fall like rain 
 Come, change our love 
 From a spark to a flame 
 Refuge from cruel wars 
 Havens from fear 
 Cities for sanctuary 
 Freedoms to share 
 Peace to the killing-fields 
 Scorched earth to green 
 Christ for the bitterness 
 His cross for the pain 
 Friend of the weak 
 Give us compassion we pray 
 Melt our cold hearts 
 Let tears fall like rain 
 Come, change our love 
 From a spark to a flame 
 Rest for the ravaged earth 
 Oceans and streams 
 Plundered and poisoned 
 Our future, our dreams 
 Lord, end our madness 
 Carelessness, greed 
 Make us content with 
 The things that we need 
 Friend of the weak 
 Give us compassion we pray 
 Melt our cold hearts 
 Let tears fall like rain 
 Come, change our love 
 From a spark to a flame 
 Lighten our darkness 
 Breathe on this flame 
 Until your justice 
 Burns brightly again 
 Until the nations 
 Learn of your ways 
 Seek your salvation 
 And bring you their praise 
 Friend of the weak 
 Give us compassion we pray 
 Melt our cold hearts 
 Let tears fall like rain 
 Come, change our love 
 From a spark to a flame 
 Friend of the weak 
 Give us compassion we pray 
 Melt our cold hearts 
 Let tears fall like rain 
 Come, change our love 
 From a spark to a flame

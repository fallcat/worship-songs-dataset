Jesus, stand among us 
 At the meeting of our lives; 
 Be our sweet agreement 
 At the meeting of our eyes. 
 O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here; 
 Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear. 
 So to You we're gathering 
 Out of each and every land; 
 Christ the love between us 
 At the joining of our hands. 
 O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here; 
 Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear. 
 Here is bread, here is wine 
 Christ is with us, he is with us 
 Break the bread, taste the wine 
 Christ is with us here 
 Here is grace, here is peace 
 Christ is with us, he is with us 
 Know his grace, find his peace 
 Feast on Jesus here 
 In this bread there is healing 
 In this cup there's life forever 
 In this moment, by the Spirit 
 Christ is with us here 
 Here we are, joined in one 
 Christ is with us, he is with us 
 We'll proclaim, till he comes 
 Jesus crucified 
 In this bread there is healing 
 In this cup there's life forever 
 In this moment, by the Spirit 
 Christ is with us here 
 Christ is with us here

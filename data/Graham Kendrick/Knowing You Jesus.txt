All I once held dear, built my life upon 
 All this world reveres, and wars to own 
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss 
 Spent and worthless now, compared to this 
 Knowing you, Jesus 
 Knowing you, there is no greater thing 
 You're my all, you're the best 
 You're my joy, my righteousness 
 And I love you, Lord 
 Now my heart's desire is to know you more 
 To be found in you and known as yours 
 To possess by faith what I could not earn 
 All-surpassing gift of righteousness 
 Oh, to know the power of your risen life 
 And to know You in Your sufferings 
 To become like you in your death, my Lord 
 So with you to live and never die

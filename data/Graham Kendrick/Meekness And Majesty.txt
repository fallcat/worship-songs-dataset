Meekness and majesty manhood and deity 
 In perfect harmony the Man who is God 
 Lord of eternity dwells in humanity 
 Kneels in humility and washes our feet 
 O what a mystery meekness and majesty 
 Bow down and worship for this is your God 
 This is your God 
 Father's pure radiance perfect in innocence 
 Yet learns obedience to death on a cross 
 Suffering to give us life 
 Conquering through sacrifice 
 And as they crucify prays Father forgive 
 O what a mystery meekness and majesty 
 Bow down and worship for this is your God 
 This is your God 
 Wisdom unsearchable God the invisible 
 Love indestructible in frailty appears 
 Lord of infinity stooping so tenderly 
 Lifts our humanity to the heights of His throne 
 O what a mystery meekness and majesty 
 Bow down and worship for this is your God 
 This is your God 
 This is your God

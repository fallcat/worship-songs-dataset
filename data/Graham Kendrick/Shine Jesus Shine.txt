Shine Jesus shine 
 Fill this land with the Father's glory 
 Blaze Spirit blaze 
 Set our hearts on fire 
 Flow river flow 
 Flood the nations with grace and mercy 
 Send forth Your Word Lord 
 And let there be light 
 Lord the light of Your love is shining 
 In the midst of the darkness shining 
 Jesus light of the world shine upon us 
 Set us free by the truth You now bring us 
 Shine on me 
 Lord I come to Your awesome presence 
 From the shadows into Your radiance 
 By the blood I may enter Your brightness 
 Search me try me consume all my darkness 
 Shine on me 
 As we gaze on Your kingly brightness 
 So our faces display Your likeness 
 Ever changing from glory to glory 
 Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story 
 Shine on me

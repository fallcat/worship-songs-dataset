Teach me to dance to the beat of your heart 
 Teach me to move in the power of your Spirit 
 Teach me to walk in the light of your presence 
 Teach me to dance to the beat of your heart 
 Teach me to love with your heart of compassion 
 Teach me to trust in the word of your promise 
 Teach me to hope in the day of your coming 
 Teach me to dance to the beat of your heart 
 You wrote the rhythm of life 
 Created heaven and earth 
 In You is joy without measure 
 So, like a child in your sight 
 I dance to see your delight 
 For I was made for your pleasure 
 Pleasure 
 Let all my movements express 
 A heart that loves to say 'yes' 
 A will that leaps to obey you 
 Let all my energy blaze 
 To see the joy in your face 
 Let my whole being praise you 
 Praise you

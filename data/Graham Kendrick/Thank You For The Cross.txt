Thank You for the cross, 
 The price You paid for us 
 How You gave Yourself 
 So completely 
 Precious Lord 
 Now our sins are gone 
 All forgiven 
 Covered by Your blood 
 All forgotten 
 Thank You, Lord (thank You, Lord) 
 Oh, I love You, Lord 
 Really love You, Lord 
 I will never understand 
 Why You love me 
 You're my deepest joy 
 You're my heart's desire 
 And the greatest thing of all, O Lord, I see 
 You delight in me! 
 For our healing there 
 Lord, You suffered 
 And to take our fear 
 You poured out Your love 
 Precious Lord 
 Calvary's work is done 
 You have conquered 
 Able now to save 
 So completely 
 Thank You, Lord 
 Thank You, Lord 
 Oh, I love You, Lord

 And the greatest thing of all, O Lord, I see 
 You delight in me!

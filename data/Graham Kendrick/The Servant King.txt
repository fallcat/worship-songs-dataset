From heaven you came helpless babe 
 Entered our world, your glory veiled 
 Not to be served but to serve 
 And give Your life that we might live 
 This is our God, The Servant King 
 He calls us now to follow Him 
 To bring our lives as a daily offering 
 Of worship to The Servant King 
 There in the garden of tears 
 My heavy load he chose to bear 
 His heart with sorrow was torn 
 'Yet not My will but Yours,' He said 
 Come see His hands and His feet 
 The scars that speak of sacrifice 
 Hands that flung stars into space 
 To cruel nails surrendered 
 So let us learn how to serve 
 And in our lives enthrone Him 
 Each other's needs to prefer 
 For it is Christ we're serving 
 (Extra section added 2013) 
 We bring our lives to you 
 A sacrifice for you 
 In view of love so true 
 We are changed, renewed

There is a hope so sure 
 A promise so secure 
 The mystery of God 
 At last made known 
 Treasures so vast appear 
 All wisdom, knowledge here 
 It's Christ in us 
 The hope of glory! 
 And the life that I now live 
 No longer is my own 
 Jesus lives in me 
 The hope of glory 
 And each day I live 
 No longer is my own 
 Jesus lives in me 
 The hope of glory 
 There is a life so true 
 A life of love so pure 
 For all our sin 
 A perfect sacrifice 
 And when that life was nailed 
 On cruel cross impaled 
 Our sinful flesh 
 With him was crucified 
 There is a life so strong 
 That a whole world of wrong 
 And all the powers of hell 
 Could not defeat 
 For Jesus rose again 
 And if we died with him 
 With him we'll rise 
 To share his endless life

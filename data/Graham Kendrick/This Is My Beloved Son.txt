This is my beloved son 
 Who tasted death 
 That you, my child, might live 
 See the blood He shed for You 
 What suffering 
 Say what more could He give 
 Clothed in His perfection 
 Bring praise, a fragrance sweet 
 Garlanded with joy 
 Come worship at His feet 
 That the Lamb who was slain 
 Might receive the reward 
 Might receive the reward of His suffering 
 Look, the world's great harvest fields 
 Are ready now 
 And Christ commands us: 'Go!' 
 Countless souls are dying 
 So hopelessly 
 His wondrous love unknown 
 Lord, give us the nations 
 For the glory of the King 
 Father, send more labourers 
 The lost to gather in 
 That the Lamb who was slain 
 Might receive the reward 
 Might receive the reward of His suffering 
 Come the day when we will stand 
 There face to face 
 What joy will fill His eyes 
 For at last His Bride appears 
 So beautiful 
 Her glory fills the skies 
 Drawn from every nation 
 People, tribe and tongue 
 All creation sings 
 The wedding has begun 
 And the Lamb who was slain 
 Shall receive the reward 
 Shall receive the reward of His suffering

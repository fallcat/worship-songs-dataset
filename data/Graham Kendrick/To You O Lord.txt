To You O Lord I lift up my soul 
 In you I trust O my God 
 Do not let me be put to shame 
 Nor let my enemies triumph over me 
 Show me your ways and teach me your paths 
 Guide me in truth lead me on 
 For you're my God, you are my Saviour 
 My hope is in you each moment of the day 
 No one whose hope is in you 
 Will ever be put to shame 
 That's why my eyes are on you Oh Lord 
 Surround me, defend me 
 Oh how I need you 
 To you I lift up my soul 
 To you I lift up my soul 
 Show me your ways and teach me your paths 
 Guide me in truth lead me on 
 For you're my God, you are my Saviour 
 My hope is in you each moment of the day 
 Remember Lord your mercy and love 
 That ever flow from of old 
 Remember not the sins of my youth 
 Or my rebellious ways 
 According to your love remember me 
 According to your love 
 For you are good O Lord

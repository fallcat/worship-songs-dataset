When I walk through suffering 
 Let it be there offering 
 Like a fragrance rising 
 In the valley of shadow 
 Not to waste my sorrows 
 But to trust and follow 
 Until the day 
 When You wipe away every tear 
 You will hold me, carry me 
 Until the day 
 When You take away every fear 
 No more suffering, who can imagine 
 So I'll trade my sorrows 
 For the joy of knowing You 
 Sharing Your [Incomprehensible] 
 With Your comfort comforting 
 Bringing hope for the hope You'll bring 
 My whole life and offering 
 Until the day 
 When You wipe away every tear 
 You will hold me, carry me 
 Until the day 
 When You take away every last fear 
 Who can imagine, who can imagine 
 Who can imagine, who can imagine the day 
 Who can imagine, who can imagine 
 No more suffering, no more crying 
 No more afraid, who can imagine the day

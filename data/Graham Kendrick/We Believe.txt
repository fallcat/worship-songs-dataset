We believe in God the Father 
 Maker of the universe 
 And in Christ, His Son, our Saviour 
 Come to us by virgin birth 
 We believe he died to save us 
 Bore our sins, was crucified 
 Then from death he rose victorious 
 Ascended to the Father's side 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 We believe He sends His Spirit 
 On His church with gifts of power 
 God, His word of truth affirming 
 Sends us to the nations now 
 He will come again in glory 
 Judge the living and the dead 
 Every knee shall bow before Him 
 Then must every tongue confess 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all 
 Name above all names 
 Name above all names 
 Name above all names 
 Lord of all

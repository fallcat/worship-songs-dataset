When I see the beauty 
 Of the sunset's glory 
 Amazing artistry 
 Across the evening sky 
 When I feel the mystery 
 Of a distant galaxy 
 It awes and humbles me 
 To be loved by a God so high 
 What can I do but thank you 
 What can I do but give 
 My life to you 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 What can I do but praise you 
 Every day make everything I do 
 A hallelujah, a hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 When I hear the story 
 Of a God of mercy 
 Who shared humanity 
 And suffered by our side 
 Of the cross they nailed you to 
 That could not hold you 
 Now you're making all things new 
 By the power of your risen life

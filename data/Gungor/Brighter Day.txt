At the start there was love 
 And life began in Him 
 Creation falls, Creator gives 
 The promise of a better day 
 We are not there yet 
 Let it come, let it come in 
 Love is here, Love is coming 
 Heaven is breaking open 
 Heaven is breaking open 
 Love came down and hope was found 
 Life began again 
 A brand new start 
 Yeah a brand new start 
 The promise of a brighter day 
 We are not there yet 
 Let it come, let it come in 
 Love is here, Love is coming 
 Heaven is breaking open 
 Heaven is breaking open 
 Let it come, let it come in 
 Love is here, Love is coming 
 Heaven is breaking open 
 Heaven is breaking open 
 Love came down and hope was found 
 Now we're waking up to a brighter day 
 Oh brighter day brighter day 
 Oh brighter day brighter day 
 Oh brighter day 
 We'll see a brighter day

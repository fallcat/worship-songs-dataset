I keep on falling 
 I keep on falling short 
 This world keeps bringing me down 
 You keep on calling 
 You keep on calling me 
 I'll keep on running 
 I'll keep on running home 
 This world is dying 
 This old world's dying now 
 But a new one's dawning 
 And You keep calling us out 
 Out, call me out, 
 You're calling me out

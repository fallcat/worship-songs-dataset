They tried to keep you in a tent 
 They could not keep you in a temple 
 Or any of their idols, to see and understand 
 We cannot keep you in a church 
 We cannot keep you in a Bible 
 Or it's just another idol to box you in 
 They could not keep you in their walls 
 We cannot keep you in ours either 
 For you are so much greater 
 Who is like the Lord 
 The maker of the heavens 
 Who dwells with the poor 
 He lifts them from the ashes 
 And He seats them among princess 
 Who is like the Lord 
 We've tried to keep you in our tents 
 We've tried to keep you in our temples 
 We've worshiped all our idols 
 We want all that to end 
 So we will find you in the streets 
 And we will find you in the prisons 
 And even in our Bibles and churches 
 Who is like the Lord 
 The maker of the heavens 
 Who dwells with the poor 
 He lifts them from the ashes 
 And He seats them among princes 
 Who is like the Lord 
 We cannot contain, cannot contain 
 The glory of your name 
 We cannot contain, cannot contain 
 The glory of your name 
 We cannot contain, cannot contain 
 The glory of your name 
 Who is like the Lord 
 You took me from the ashes 
 And you healed me from my blindness 
 Who is like the Lord

Let church bells ring 
 Let children sing 
 Even if they don't know why let them sing 
 Why drown their joy 
 Stifle their voice 
 Just because you've lost yours 
 May our jaded hearts be healed 
 Amen 
 Let old men dance 
 Lift up their hands 
 Even if they are na√Øve, let them dance 
 You've seen it all 
 You watch them fall 
 Wash off your face and dance 
 May our weary hearts be filled with hope 
 Amen

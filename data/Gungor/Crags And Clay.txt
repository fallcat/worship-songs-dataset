Standing up from crags and clay 
 The peaks of earth 
 In full display 
 They break the lines 
 That break the sky 
 That's full of life 
 Full of life 
 The chaos of creation's dance 
 A tapestry, a symphony 
 Of life himself 
 Of love herself 
 It's written in our very skin 
 All praises to the one who made it all 
 Who made it all 
 All praises to the one who made it all 
 And finds it beautiful 
 Soil is spilling life to life 
 Stars are born 
 To fill the night 
 The ocean's score 
 The majesty 
 Of sculpted shore 
 Mystery 
 All praises to the one who made it all 
 Who made it all 
 All praises to the one who made it all 
 And finds it beautiful 
 Fearfully and wonderfully and beautifully made.

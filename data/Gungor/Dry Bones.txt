My soul cries out 
 My soul cries out for you 
 These bones cry out 
 These dry bones cry for you 
 To live and move 
 Only You 
 Can raise the dead 
 Lift my head up 
 Jesus, You're the one who saves us 
 Constantly creates us into something new 
 Jesus You're the one who finds us 
 Surely our Messiah will make all things new

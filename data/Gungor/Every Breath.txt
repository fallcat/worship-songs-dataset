Every breath 
 Every moment life beats in my chest 
 Springs up from your hand 
 Creation resounds 
 With every color and every sound 
 Your love is calling 
 I will love you with all of my heart 
 I will love you with all of my mind 
 I'll love you with all of my strength 
 Love you with everything 
 Every breath every moment life beats in my chest 
 Let my life praise you 
 I will love you with all of my heart 
 I will love you with all of my mind 
 I'll love you with all of my strength 
 Love you with everything 
 I will love you with all of my heart 
 I will love you with all of my mind 
 I'll love you with all of my strength 
 Love you with everything 
 Here I am Lord 
 All I am Lord 
 Here I am Lord 
 I am yours.

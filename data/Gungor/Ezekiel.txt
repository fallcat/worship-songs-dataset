I found you naked 
 I found you lying there in blood 
 Your mother left you 
 Your father threw you out unloved 
 I clothed your body 
 I washed the blood and earth from your hair 
 I gave you jewelry 
 I gave you everything I had 
 I gave my heart 
 My heart, my love 
 I gave my heart 
 My heart, my love 
 You became mine 
 You were a stunning bride 
 The world they saw you and how you loved their eyes my bride 
 You broke my heart 
 My heart, my love 
 You broke my heart 
 My heart, my love 
 You sold your body exposed yourself to all my love 
 You slept with strangers; you gave them everything we had 
 Come back my love 
 My love come back 
 Come back my love 
 My love come back

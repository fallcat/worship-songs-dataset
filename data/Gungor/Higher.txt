There is no one there is no one like You 
 No one like you 
 In heaven or on earth 
 Only good things can ever come from you 
 Even your judgment 
 Is righteous and true 
 Your Name is sweeter than the rain that falls upon 
 The face of dry and weary land 
 And causes us to turn our face again 
 Your Name be praised 
 And be lifted higher 
 There is no one... 
 With every morning there are mercies new 
 Your kindness 
 Brings us back to you 
 Your name is stronger than the pain 
 It's covering the shame of all these weary hands 
 And causing us to turn our face again 
 Your Name be praised

Late have I loved you, 
 O Beauty so ancient, 
 So new. 
 Late have I loved you 
 You were within me, but I was outside you 
 It was there that I searched for you 
 It was there that I searched for you 
 Late have I loved you, 
 O Beauty so ancient, so new. 
 You were here with me 
 But I was not with You 
 It was there that you found me 
 It was there that you found me 
 You called and you shouted, 
 You broke through my deafness. 
 You flashed and you shone, 
 Dispelled my blindness. 
 You breathed your fragrance on me 
 You breathed your fragrance on me 
 Late have I loved you 
 I drew in your breath 
 I keep on breathing 
 I've tasted I've seen 
 And now I want more 
 You breathed your fragrance on me 
 You breathed your fragrance on me 
 Late have I loved you

Darkness hovering 
 Grasping everything it sees 
 Void empty 
 Absent life and absent dream 
 Let there be 
 Let there be 
 Angels toil and crack open scrolls of ancient dreams 
 Countless worlds of his 
 Brilliant stars and breath and stream 
 Let there be 
 Let there be 
 Let there be 
 Let there be 
 Let there be 
 Let there be 
 Let there be light 
 Let there be light 
 Where there is darkness 
 Let there be light 
 Where there is nothing 
 Let there be light.

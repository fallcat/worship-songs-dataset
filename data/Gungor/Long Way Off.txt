The smartest men, they built a rocket 
 Aimed it at a target far, far, far away 
 But by the time they knew they lost it 
 It was a long way, was a long way, was a long way 
 We're a long way, we're a long way, we're a long way off 
 The smartest men, they saw a world with 
 Corners and endings far, far, far away 
 But when they drew it out and searched it 
 They were a long way, were a long way, were a long way 
 We're a long way, we're a long way, we're a long way 
 The erudite composed a thesis 
 Everything we see is all, all, all there is 
 But as an apophatic mystic 
 We're a long way, we're a long way, we're a long way 
 We're a long way, we're a long way, we're a long way off 
 When the waves of time 
 Wash the shores stark clean 
 Of the memories, the last of me 
 With my castles gone to the constant sea 
 Will you stay with me 
 Stay with me

We could have tongues of angels 
 We could move mountains with our faith 
 We could give everything away 
 But if we don't have love 
 We're left with nothing 
 We could see blind eyes opened 
 Know all the mysteries of our faith 
 We could sing all the highest praise 
 But if we don't have love 
 We're left with nothing 
 People of god rise up 
 Rise up and shine god's love 
 We are the light of the world 
 Of the world oh 
 We are the light of the world 
 Of the world oh 
 Love is the what holds it all together 
 Love never fails, it never dies 
 There is no deeper truth 
 We know that god is love, our god is love 
 Tear down the walls that divide us 
 Let love rebuild and unite us 
 All we need is 
 All we need is love

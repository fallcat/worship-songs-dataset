I've tried to stand my ground 
 I've tried to understand 
 But I can't seem to find my way 
 Like water on the sand 
 Or grasping at the wind 
 I keep on falling short 
 Please be my strength 
 Please be my strenth 
 I don't have anymore 
 I don't have anymore 
 I'm looking for a place 
 That I can plant my faith 
 One thing I know for sure 
 I cannot create it 
 I cannot sustain it 
 It's Your love that's keeping (captured) me 
 Please be my strength... 
 At my final breath 
 I hope that I can say 
 I've fought the good fight of faith 
 I pray your glory shines 
 Through this doubting heart of mine 
 So my world would know that You 
 You are my strength 
 You and You alone 
 You and You alone 
 Keep bringin' me back home- on the tag

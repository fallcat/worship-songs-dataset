Seems like all I can see was the struggle 
 Haunted by ghosts that lived in my past 
 Bound up in shackles of all my failures 
 Wondering how long is this gonna last 
 Then You look at this prisoner and say to me "son 
 Stop fighting a fight that's already been won" 
 I am redeemed, You set me free 
 So I'll shake off theses heavy chains 
 Wipe away every stain now I'm not who I used to be 
 I am redeemed 
 All my life I have been called unworthy 
 Named by the voice of my shame and regret 
 But when I hear You whisper, "Child lift up your head" 
 I remember oh God, You're not done with me yet 
 I don't have to be the old man inside of me 
 'Cause his day is long dead and gone 
 I've got a new name, a new life I'm not the same 
 And a hope that will carry me home

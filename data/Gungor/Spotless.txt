Spotless. Beautifully blameless 
 Tragically broken because of love 
 All sin taken upon Him 
 Willingly broken because of love 
 O Light of the world 
 Thank You for mercy 
 Thank You for mercy 
 You cover me 
 Cover all my sin with crimson 
 His cross intended for great loss 
 Became the picture of hope for the world 
 His crown, intended to mock Him 
 Irony withheld. They didn't know 
 They didn't know

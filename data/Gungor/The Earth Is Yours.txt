Your voice it thunders 
 The oaks start twisting 
 The forest sounds with cedars breaking 
 The waters see You and start their writhing 
 From the depths a song is rising 
 Now it's rising from the ground 
 Holy, Holy 
 Holy, Holy Lord the earth is Yours and singing 
 Holy, Holy 
 Holy, Holy Lord 
 The earth is Yours 
 The earth is Yours 
 Your voice it thunders 
 The ground is shaking 
 The might mountains now are trembling 
 Creation sees You 
 And starts composing 
 The fields and trees they start rejoicing. 
 Now it's rising from the ground 
 Now it's rising from the ground 
 It's rising from the ground 
 Hear us crying out 
 Hear us crying out

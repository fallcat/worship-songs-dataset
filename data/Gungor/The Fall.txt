The fall, the fall, oh God the fall of man 
 The fruit is found in every eye and every hand 
 Nothing there is nothing yet in truest form 
 We walk like ghosts upon the earth 
 The ground it groans 
 How long, how long will you wait 
 How long, how long till you save us all, save us all 
 Turn your face to me 
 Turn your face to me 
 Turn your face to me 
 Turn your face to me 
 The light, the light 
 The morning light is gone 
 And all that's left is fragile breath in failing lungs 
 The night, the night 
 The guiding night has come 
 Uniting lover with his bride 
 More precious than the dawn 
 How long must we wait 
 Turn your face to me 
 Turn your face to me 
 Turn your face to me 
 Turn your face to me

Most days our flag flows 
 Whichever way winds blow 
 That's the way things go 
 Most days faith stays blind 
 Conceded by desire 
 Like winds that blow 
 That's the way things go 
 May your love, anchor us 
 May your love, anchor us 
 The genius wasted 
 To commit curse and wind? 
 But for grace we go 
 The unseen scares us 
 The true remains untried 
 In our hearts onto 
 Let our hearts in You 
 May your love, anchor us 
 May your love, anchor us 
 May your love, anchor us

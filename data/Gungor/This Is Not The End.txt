This is not the end 
 This is not the end of this 
 We will open our eyes wide, wider 
 This is not our last 
 This is not our last breath 
 We will open our mouths wide, wider 
 And you know you'll be all right 
 Oh and you know you'll be all right 
 This is not the end 
 This is not the end of us 
 We will shine like the stars bright, brighter.

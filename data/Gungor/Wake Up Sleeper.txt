Rejoice all you who are poor 
 The kingdom is yours 
 The kingdom is yours 
 Rejoice you jaded and torn 
 Both sinner and saint 
 The kingdom is yours 
 Woe to you religious teachers 
 Rich and worshiping your book 
 Woe to you who use His name to justify the souls you took 
 Wake up, wake up 
 Oh sleeper from the dead 
 Wake up 
 Rejoice you lonely and lost 
 You sick and despised 
 All will be made right 
 Rejoice you cynics and freaks 
 Those searching for peace 
 All will be made right 
 Even you religious teachers 
 Separating us from them 
 Heaven's found inside us all 
 So turn and come alive again 
 Wake up, wake up 
 Oh sleeper from the dead 
 Wake up 
 Awaken us, awaken us 
 Open our eyes and wake us 
 (Let your church now wake up)

Create in me a clean heart, a clean heart 
 For I have turned my face from You 
 Teach us of Your ways oh God, oh God 
 For we have turned away from You 
 Lord have mercy 
 We will run to you, we will run to you 
 Turning from our sin we return to You 
 Father heal your world, make all things new 
 Make all things new 
 Your love and mercy build and shape us 
 Break us and recreate us now 
 Lord have mercy 
 Oh, bring us back to you

Like the waters flooding the desert 
 Like the sunrise showing all things 
 Where it comes flowers grow 
 Lions sleep, gravestones roll 
 Where death dies all things live 
 Where it comes poor men feast 
 Kings fall down to their knees 
 When death dies all things live 
 All things live 
 Like a woman searching and finding love 
 Like an ocean buried and bursting forth 
 Where it comes flowers grow 
 Lions sleep, gravestones roll 
 Where death dies all things come alive 
 Where it comes water's clean 
 Children fed 
 All believe 
 When death dies all things live 
 All things live...

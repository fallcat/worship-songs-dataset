Love, love, love of mine 
 You have caused the sun to shine on us 
 Music fills our ears 
 Flavors kiss our lips with love divine 
 You are the beauty 
 You are the light 
 You are the love, love of mine 
 Breath and sex and sight 
 All things made for good in love divine 
 You are the beauty 
 You are the light 
 You are the love, love of mine

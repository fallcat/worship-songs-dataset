Out on the farthest edge 
 There in the silence 
 You were there 
 My faith was torn to shreds 
 Heart in the balance 
 But you were there 
 Always faithful 
 Always good 
 You have still have my 
 You still have my heart 
 I thought I had seen the end 
 Everything broken 
 But you were there 
 I've wandered heaven's gates 
 I've made my bed in hell 
 You were there still 
 You have me 
 You have my heart completely

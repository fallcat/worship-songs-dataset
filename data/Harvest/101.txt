Face the war and honor tradition 
 The sacrificial lamb 
 Murder for the crucified 
 Adherence to his faith 
 Self indulgent bleeding 
 For beauty becomes the slave as the prophets take it all away 
 Deny the game 
 Lose again 
 The soulless figures repent the dead 
 Revere the faceless 
 Extend the motion 
 Support the absence of 
 The war tears through the fabric that unites the nation with independence 
 Force in our nature 
 The deity's ancient laws give us the right to kill 
 Touch the intent 
 Kiss the ground 
 Overthrown as you taste tomorrow 
 You've taken away the right to justice 
 Annihilation of civilized man 
 Religious sect, procured and doctored to allow for a total holocaust 
 The warrior remains in idol history revered for uncommon valor 
 As the war rages on, upon this land where I grew 
 So sacred and untouched 
 Now scarred by this revelation 
 You die in the name of hopeless abandon 
 You lie forsaking your brother's love 
 You die at the hands of this holy war 
 You die in vain for another's blood

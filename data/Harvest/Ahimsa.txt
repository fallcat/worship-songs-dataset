Persecution is not a value I wish to instill 
 Your freedom means nothing when the heart kills 
 Confront this father figure 
 Repent the suffering 
 With indignant eyes hollowed out to see the dead survive 
 Our cries for sympathy bleed in our darkest hour 
 Let the vengeance rain down on me 
 Let this wrath satiate my being 
 Conform to the Christ figure I defy 
 With an act of mercy I cry 
 If I am saved, if I am healed, then why am I not free? Hardened heart brings a cold fist 
 This god complex will never miss 
 Bend to break the structure 
 Bleed to make me believe 
 Subject yourself to violent action, we are what we see 
 Don't turn away and run, you will never see it coming 
 If I am saved, if I am healed, then why am I not free? I have learned to deny what has been forced onto me 
 A course tongue favors ascension 
 Speak the evil truth with which we crave 
 The demon lies with incantation 
 Buried instincts sends us to our grave 
 Raise the dead 
 Lift the veil 
 Complete the cycle of redemption

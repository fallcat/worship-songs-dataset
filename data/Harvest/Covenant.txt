Forced my will, sanctify, sacrifice myself 
 I forged a chance for a look into my soul 
 Tear out my eyes for everlasting life 
 I won't fall to the ritual 
 As the soul changed, it's healed and released 
 That which you give, that which you seek, ask it and it shall 
 Seek and ye shall learn 
 Release the chokehold 
 The senses yearn, so you will be my savior 
 So you will set me free 
 This moral indoctrination 
 The water deceives 
 You left me broken, hard hearted, and yet you still made me suffer for what you deserved 
 No need for attainment 
 The consequence of your actions has left me afraid 
 Fall through the cracks 
 Let me down 
 Let me go free

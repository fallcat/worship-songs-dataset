Collision with the notion that things could change 
 I feel so fucking worthless 
 This struggle is in vein 
 I need a way out from the eternal senseless defiance that I find in you 
 Not an ounce of trust courses through your veins 
 I'm holding on with what is left as my life's blood spills into hatred 
 All these eyes are staring me down 
 Stripped of morals, I'll stand my ground 
 Bring it on, for no one will take what I am away again 
 Look beyond, I see the end of despair 
 Those thoughts are dead 
 I remain a survivor in the war against this rival

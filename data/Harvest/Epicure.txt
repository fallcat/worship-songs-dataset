"Running out of time burning out on this life again running out of silence crying out for redemption and I will be the wounded the flame that flickers over the shame will wash away and the guilt will lead me to violence I carry over into what would be suicide my mind my very soul is tearing me apart lies won't save us sorrow no fucking hope just this once be my savior this is war I won't let you neglect your fate what will control the pacifist when violence rains down and brings death what will consume the world's eyes if there's no violence in their minds it's just like you and I will be the wounded the flame that flickers over the shame comes from what's inside as you stand and watch life in a sane world why is this wrong time is my fucking ali and this time it means war I won't let you neglect your fate"

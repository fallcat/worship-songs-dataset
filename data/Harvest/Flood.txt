Flowers wilt when they lose the rain 
 And the sun will leave them dead again 
 For how long can we live like this? Is it eternal? Face to face, defy disgrace 
 The fevered death of a nation 
 Consent to bleed, the tyrant leads us to our decimation 
 Here it comes, the final word 
 Can I open my eyes and watch it burn 
 One day we will be sickened by life as we realize 
 Up against the wall 
 Our bitter freedom 
 A fight for survival 
 A means to an end, forever 
 How long will it take to destroy our lives under the sun? And enforce the limits that will confine us? Beyond broken eyes 
 I thirst for a life without hurt 
 Devoid of fault, without deception 
 Hollow eyes 
 There's no god to save you, save me 
 Onward we march as the day grows dim 
 This pestilence leads to revulsion 
 Cannot taste the blood of the martyr until you face this revolution 
 One day we will forge a path of survival

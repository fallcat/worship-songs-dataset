Now I know why some things never change. Just another foot in the door. Just 
 Another life of sorrow. Now I could lie and say he meant nothing. 
 Persistence broke the silence. I've lost a friend. You had to die and leave 
 The broken hearts that followed behind. I can't erase this face that brings 
 Me pain. I am in denial for in you was the vision of discipline, truth 
 Revealed. I won't let you fall away from my memories. The heart endures 
 Unyielding, the times with you won't fade. Burned by the sting of loss for 
 Someone so close. Afraid. Receive forgiveness. There's no one to blame. May 
 You live on. No one believed that you held it inside. Blind is the fury that 
 Concealed your cries. May you live on. I try to erase this face that brings 
 Me pain and leaves me behind this wall, but I won't forget that part of you 
 That would catch me when I'd fall. You will survive in my heart. Engraved in 
 My mind. Doubt will persevere from the spirit that I may never find.

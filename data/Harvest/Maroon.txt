Indulge in hatred towards your mental opposition. Protest your anguish. A 
 Defiant innocent victim. Comply with the standard that defines oppression. 
 By the hand of what god do we bury our sorrows in? Born of violence, 
 Victimized by the sovereign nation. Deliverance. Supported by the creed, 
 Thus adorned. Discernment leads to glory for those who will condemn. Absolve 
 Affliction for those who can't defend. Flourish in our madness. Choke what 
 Breath is left. Unprovoked malicious acts need to be suppressed. Worn by the 
 Silence of this blind revolt. Time offers conscience, torn by this decree. 
 Conviction. It crushed my eyes. Deliver me from my sanity, from this shell 
 Of abhorrence. You won't restrain me. The illness torments. Confined by my 
 Lack of resolution. Guilty of one crime which is existing. Burn the liar, 
 Repent desire. Detest emotion, sets the fire. I will find some form of 
 Justice to end malevolence and this I vow. You won't forget and I won't 
 Forgive. You won't decide my fate. You won't rape my freedom. For I will 
 Have my rights. Burn you for your treason. You won't forget and I won't 
 Forgive you and you will burn.

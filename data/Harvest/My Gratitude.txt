"I tell myself that I don't need to tell you why I feel like the forgotten one what can I do to light up my world how can I see the day when it's over how can I face the world when it's against me how can I face myself when I'm broken how can I reach out for you when I'm slipping away feel the strength fill the void with your arms in the air raise your hands to the sky commit yourself to the day when you feel you can ask for the favor in return for the promise that is kept the promise to your life this horizon has saved my life your persistence has kept me in line all the things I dream for myself are one step closer than the last I extend my gratitude to you for the things you've given to me and now that you've opened my eyes what can I offer you you light up my world and I thank you"

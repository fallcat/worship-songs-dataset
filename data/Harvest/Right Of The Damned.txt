"Right of the damned I try to wipe the smile from your face the endurance the imbalance of making mistakes how long will it last until you've burned the bridges down I can only wait so long on your word right of the damned what do you see when you look at yourself the thoughts the denial and the betrayal another friendship lost to this world now you're alone there's no way out liar you fucking liar accept this as your hell right now this is it"

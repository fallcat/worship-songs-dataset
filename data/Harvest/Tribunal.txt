Imaged, etched, defined 
 Calloused words reflect the mind 
 Devotion to a sordid prophet 
 A slave to the age old laws 
 Can't sustain the life 
 Caught up in the web of my pride 
 Urn the other way, you don't want to face this 
 That which buries me alive 
 I won't succumb, I won't neglect 
 For those who fought to protect, I feel mourning 
 I won't succumb, I won't neglect 
 For those who fought to protect, I feel sadness 
 Nullify the vision 
 Behold the aversion 
 The divine repentance before the dawn 
 I have found in this reflection those that believed that time altering life was a symbol of pride 
 Awaken and arise 
 Imaged, etched, defined 
 Disbelieve tradition 
 Adherence to this honor 
 A faith based execution 
 You are not alone, I am not on my own 
 You remain afraid, you must face this pain 
 Fall from glory into darkness 
 Damned are we 
 Fall from glory

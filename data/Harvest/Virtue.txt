Dedication to discipline 
 Endurance of self separation 
 Sustain the sense to remain 
 Give of the feeling, control your life 
 Empower 
 Slave, suffer 
 Never will I ignore 
 No more ingestion of submission to this world 
 Dedicate some time to that which brings you to life 
 Empty without substance 
 You're just a slave to the hand that pulls the strings 
 Ignite the will 
 Self acceptance the first discipline 
 Obligation to fulfill your endeavors 
 You control your actions 
 You may free yourself 
 Suffer, slave

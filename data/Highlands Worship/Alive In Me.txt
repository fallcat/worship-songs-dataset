My past is erased because of the cross 
 Hope writes my future because of Your love 
 You have restored me for Your glory, Lord 
 Now I have the victory 'cause You've overcome 
 Love came in like a tidal wave 
 Hope rushing in running through my veins 
 Jesus, You're alive in me 
 Grace overflow like I've never known 
 Life breathing in speaking to these bones 
 Jesus, You're alive in me, You're alive in me 
 Your Spirit is here, freedom's all around 
 Shifting the atmosphere and breaking walls down 
 My faith is arising, faith is alight in You 
 This heart is ignited, heaven is breaking through 
 Love came in like a tidal wave 
 Hope rushing in running through my veins 
 Jesus, You're alive in me 
 Grace overflow like I've never known 
 Life breathing in speaking to these bones 
 Jesus, You're alive in me, You're alive in me 
 Faith is rising 
 Heaven opened 
 Chains are broken 
 Jesus, You're alive in me 
 Faith is rising 
 Heaven opened 
 Chains are broken 
 Jesus, You're alive in me 
 Faith is rising 
 Heaven opened 
 Chains are broken 
 Jesus, You're alive in me 
 Love came in like a tidal wave 
 Hope rushing in running through my veins 
 Jesus, You're alive in me 
 Grace overflow like I've never known 
 Life breathing in speaking to these bones 
 Jesus, You're alive in me 
 Jesus, You're alive in me

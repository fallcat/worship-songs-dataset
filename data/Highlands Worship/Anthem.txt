You are the hope of generations 
 You are the Savior, we are the rescued 
 Every mouth will sing Your praises 
 Freely we offer all to You 
 Lord, hear us now 
 Shout the anthem of Your praises 
 Ringing loud 
 The passion of our desperation 
 In our hearts 
 Our love, our trust, our adoration 
 Hear us now 
 Shout the anthem of Your praises

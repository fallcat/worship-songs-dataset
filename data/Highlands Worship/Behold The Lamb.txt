I want to see You 
 Just the way You are 
 Clothed in glory 
 Maker of the stars 
 King of Heaven 
 Sacrificed for all 
 I want to see You 
 Just the way You are 
 Sin is broken 
 Purchased by Your blood 
 Lamb of God 
 Who takes away the cares of the world 
 Behold, the Lamb 
 Who's seated on the throne 
 He reigns in majesty 
 His love, won't fade 
 His mercies never fail 
 He reigns in majesty 
 Majesty

 The highest praise 
 Unto You alone 
 With one voice we sing 
 You alone deserve 
 The highest praise 
 Unto You alone 
 With one voice we sing

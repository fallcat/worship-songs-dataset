I want to know You 
 I want to know You 
 I will set my eyes on You 
 And no one else 
 I long for You 
 Pull me closer 
 I collapse within Your truth 
 I'm falling fast 
 You guard my life 
 I surrender 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Only You, my Lord 
 Jesus 
 How I long to see Your face 
 To know Your voice 
 To look at You in Your wonder 
 I am nothing without You 
 Alone in doubt 
 But when I cry, You wil answer 
 Oh 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Jesus 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You, my Lord 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You, my Lord 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You, my Lord 
 Jesus 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You, my Lord 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Jesus, You're my everything 
 You're my everything 
 Yes You are 
 You're my everything 
 Only You, God 
 You're my everything 
 You're my everything

Mountains bow 
 Storms back down 
 At the mention of your name 
 You came down 
 Left your crown 
 With a heart to make me great 
 You are faithful God 
 You're the all consuming one 
 Emmanuel 
 You are gracious 
 Slow to anger 
 Rich in love 
 Compassionate 
 You are faithful 
 God with us 
 God with us 
 Hope abounds 
 Grace astounds 
 The cross victorious 
 Darkness hides 
 From your light 
 Salvation's come to us 
 You are faithful God 
 You're the all consuming one 
 Emmanuel 
 You are gracious 
 Slow to anger 
 Rich in love 
 Compassionate 
 You are faithful 
 God with us 
 God with us

 So faithful, you are God 
 With all my grace, in every boast 
 I will declare you are my Lord 
 Nothing compares to the promise found in You 
 With all my grace in every boast 
 I will declare you are my Lord 
 Nothing compares to the promise found in You 
 Emmanuel

Please wipe away 
 The part of me that gets in the way 
 I want to see You once again 
 Show Yourself to me 
 So everything else will fade to gray 
 I want to feel Your presence here 
 Let the world fade away 
 Let the world fade away 
 Let the world fade away 
 I want to see Your face 
 Let the world fade away 
 Let the world fade away 
 I want to see Your face

I find my resting place here in Your presence 
 I find grace at the cross of my rescue 
 There's no way I will keep silent 
 For my Jesus came to take my place 
 I will give it all for the King who took my fall 
 Shed His blood just to be with me 
 I once was lost, now I'm found in Your love 
 My life, I give it all for the glory of the cross 
 Just to know You placed the world on Your shoulders 
 All my life I'll live to bring You praise 
 There's no way I'd live for another 
 For Your love has resurrected me 
 I will give it all for the King who took my fall 
 Shed His blood just to be with me 
 I once was lost now I'm found in Your love 
 My life, I give it all 
 Jesus, all my hope is in Your name 
 Jesus, I'm standing in Your victory 
 Jesus, all my hope is in Your name 
 Jesus, I'm standing in Your victory 
 Jesus, all my hope is in Your name 
 Jesus, I'm standing in Your victory 
 I will give it all for the King who took my fall 
 Shed His blood just to be with me 
 I once was lost, now I'm found in Your love 
 My life, I give it all 
 I will give it all for the King who took my fall 
 Shed His blood just to be with me 
 I once was lost, now I'm found in Your love 
 My life, I give it all for the glory of the cross 
 For the glory

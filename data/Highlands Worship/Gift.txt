What can I live for You 
 What can I give to You 
 A costly gift so pure 
 Spent on You, my Lord 
 What can I bring to You 
 What can I sing for You 
 A simple song of love 
 From my heart to Yours 
 There's so much more I can give 
 There's so much more I can give 
 Take my life 
 It's all I have 
 My offering 
 I give it freely 
 Take my heart 
 Take all of me 
 My offering to You 
 Take this gift 
 Take this gift 
 It's all for You

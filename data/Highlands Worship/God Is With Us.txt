What is man that You would notice us 
 And that You would come to rescue us 
 We couldn't live a day without Your touch 
 Come alive in us 
 You're the life in us 
 Hallelujah 
 God is with us 
 God is with us 
 I can tell 
 We are covered 
 In the love of Jesus 
 God is with us 
 Amen 
 We will raise our voices to the sky 
 And let Jesus' name be lifted high 
 That the world might hear salvation's songs 
 And sing along 
 And come and sing along 
 In the autumn leaves, in the summer sky 
 All around the world, I see the signs 
 He lives 
 Our Jesus lives 
 When winter fades into the spring 
 In you, in me, in everything 
 He lives, our Jesus lives

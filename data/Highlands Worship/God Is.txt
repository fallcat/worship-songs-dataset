Be lifted high, oh God 
 What is man that You would be mindful of us 
 Or to give Your Son as freely as You gave 
 To love a sinful world as You love it 
 You reign, You reign 
 Our God is the Savior 
 He rules and reigns over all 
 And with our voices raised 
 We lift Him high 
 Be lifted high 
 A heart that loves above all others with compassion 
 To give amazing grace so freely as You give 
 Your tender mercies draw us closer to You 
 You live, You live 
 Our God is the Savior 
 He rules and reigns over all 
 And with our voices raised 
 We lift Him high 
 Our God is the Savior 
 He rules and reigns over all 
 And with our voices raised 
 We lift Him high 
 Be lifted high 
 Only You satisfy 
 You satisfy me 
 Only You satisfy 
 You satisfy me 
 Only You satisfy 
 You satisfy me 
 Only You satisfy 
 You satisfy me 
 Our God is the Savior 
 He rules and reigns over all 
 And with our voices raised 
 We lift Him high 
 Be lifted high, oh God 
 Our God is the Savior 
 He rules and reigns over all 
 And with our voices raised 
 We lift Him high 
 Be lifted high 
 Our God is 
 Our God is 
 Our God is 
 Our God is

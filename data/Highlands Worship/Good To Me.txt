I will seek You 
 I will find You in 
 The secret place 
 I will sing of 
 I will call upon 
 Your holy name 
 You are good 
 To me 
 You are good 
 To me 
 You are good 
 To me 
 You are good to me 
 I will worship You 
 I will worship You 
 I will worship You 
 You are good to me 
 I will bow at Your feet 
 I will bow at Your feet 
 I will bow at Your feet 
 You are good to me

You are good, Your mercies last a lifetime 
 You're the perfect Son of God 
 In Your eyes, the precious love of heaven 
 It sends life into my soul 
 I am Yours and all that's in me is singing 
 Come and have Your way, have Your way 
 Have Your way, have Your way 
 You're my song, Your ways are strength to me 
 How I long to please Your heart 
 I am Yours and all that's in me is singing, yeah 
 Come and have Your way, have Your way, 
 Have Your way, Have Your way 
 Wherever You lead me, I'll go 
 I want to heed Your voice 
 Whatever You speak I'll follow 
 I want to know You more 
 Wherever You lead me, I'll go 
 I want to heed Your voice 
 Whatever You speak I'll follow 
 I want to know You more 
 Come and have Your way, Have Your way in me 
 Have Your way in me, I am Yours 
 Come have Your way, have Your way, have Your way 
 Have Your way in me, Have Your way in me

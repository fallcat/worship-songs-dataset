Carried only by Your grace and mercy God 
 Though we are undeserving 
 You called us Your own 
 Once were orphaned, now we sit at the table of the King 
 And no ear has heard or eye has seen 
 The love that lives through all eternity 
 He is all we need 
 Savior to the lonely ones 
 Banner of victory 
 Hope of the world 
 He calls the darkness into light 
 He brings the dead to life 
 He is all we need 
 He is all we need 
 Narrow is the road that You call us to walk 
 A life of surrender 
 A living sacrifice 
 Now all our earthly treasures 
 We count them all as loss 
 And we will gladly answer the call 
 And humbly we will take up our cross 
 Because... 
 He is all we need 
 Savior to the lonely ones 
 Banner of victory 
 Hope of the world 
 He calls the darkness into light 
 He brings the dead to life 
 He is all we need 
 He is all we need 
 Oh we believe it Lord 
 We declare dependence on you Father 
 You are all we need, Lord 
 Jesus, Savior has come 
 We believe. The Savior has come 
 We know that 
 Victory's been won 
 Oh because, the Savior has come 
 'Cause... 
 He is all we need 
 Savior to the lonely ones 
 Banner of victory 
 Hope of the world 
 He calls the darkness into light 
 He brings the dead to life 
 He is all we need 
 He is all we need 
 Oh we believe it, Lord 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 He is all we need

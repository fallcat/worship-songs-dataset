High and holy King, You had it all and 
 You left everything, You walked the earth beneath 
 To make a way for me 
 Humbled to a cross, You suffered death and 
 Paid the highest cost, You died so I could live 
 You washed away my sin 
 Now I can see You, now I can know You 
 Now my heart has a song to sing 
 Jesus, I love You 
 Oh, how I love You 
 You have my heart, my everything 
 My everything 
 The stone was rolled away, You took the keys and 
 Conquered hell and grave, now death has lost its sting 
 It has no hold on me 
 Now I can see You, now I can know You 
 Now my heart has a song to sing 
 Jesus, I love You 
 Oh, how I love You 
 You have my heart, my everything 
 My everything 
 Here I surrender, now and forever 
 All that I am, all of me at Your feet 
 Jesus, my Savior, now and forever 
 All that I am, all of me at Your feet 
 Here I surrender, now and forever 
 All that I am, all of me at Your feet 
 Jesus, my Savior, now and forever 
 All that I am, all of me at Your feet 
 Now I can see You, now I can know You 
 Now my heart has a song to sing 
 Jesus, I love You 
 Oh, how I love You 
 You have my heart, my everything 
 Now I can see You, now I can know You 
 Now my heart has a song to sing 
 Jesus, I love You 
 Oh, how I love You 
 You have my heart, my everything 
 Here I surrender, now and forever 
 All that I am, all of me at Your feet 
 Jesus, my Savior, now and forever 
 All that I am, all of me at Your feet

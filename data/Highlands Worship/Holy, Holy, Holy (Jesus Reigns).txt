Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty 
 Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee 
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty 
 God in three persons, blessed Trinity 
 Holy, holy, holy though the darkness hide Thee 
 Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see 
 Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee 
 Perfect in power, in love, and purity 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Jesus reigns 
 Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty 
 All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth 
 And sky, and sea 
 Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty 
 God in three persons, blessed Trinity 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Jesus reigns 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Jesus reigns 
 Let all the earth proclaim, all the people sing 
 You are holy, You are holy 
 Let all the Heavens ring, worthy is the King 
 You are holy, You are holy 
 Let all the earth proclaim, all the people sing 
 You are holy, You are holy 
 Let all the Heavens ring, worthy is the King 
 You are holy, You are holy 
 Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty 
 God in three persons, blessed Trinity 
 Blessed Trinity, blessed Trinity

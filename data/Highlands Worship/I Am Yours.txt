Mercy abounding 
 You took me in 
 You gave me hope 
 To carry on 
 So here 
 Here I am 
 I will adore You 
 Only You 
 I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 Here in Your arms 
 Lord, I am Yours 
 I'm overtaken 
 Seeking Your face 
 With reckless abandon 
 I'm in awe of You 
 So here 
 Here I am 
 Seeking to find You 
 Only You 
 Hear my heart 
 I join the song 
 Of heaven 
 Hear my heart 
 I join the song of heaven

With the rising of the sun 
 I will praise You 
 And at the setting of the same 
 It shall go on 
 For You've given me joy 
 You've given me freedom 
 Now how could I ever stop 
 How could I ever stop 
 Jesus, in everything You're all I see 
 Your love has set me free 
 You're why I sing 
 Jesus, You make all things new 
 I am alive in You 
 All my days to worship You 
 In every struggle, every trial 
 I will praise You 
 And if the world around me falls 
 It shall go on 
 For You've given me joy 
 You've given me freedom 
 Now how could I ever stop 
 How could I ever stop 
 Jesus, You make all things new 
 I am alive in You 
 All my days to worship You 
 Jesus, You make all things new 
 I am alive in You 
 All my days to worship You 
 I worship You 
 Jesus, in everything You're all I see 
 Your love has set me free 
 You're why I sing 
 Jesus, You make all things new 
 I am alive in You 
 All my days to worship You 
 Jesus, You make all things new 
 I am alive in You 
 All my days to worship You 
 I worship You, oh Lord

Just as I am, without one plea 
 But that Thy blood was shed for me 
 And that Thou bidd'st me to come to Thee 
 Oh Lamb of God, I come 
 Just as I am, thy love unknown 
 Has broken every barrier down 
 Now to be Thine, yea 
 Thine alone 
 Oh Lamb of God, I come 
 I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 Here in Your arms 
 Lord, I am Yours

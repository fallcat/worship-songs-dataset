I see the kingdom of heaven come near 
 I see the power of sin disappear 
 The cross is telling a story 
 The hope and the glory of You 
 I see the kingdom of heaven come near 
 I see the darkness beginning to clear 
 Our lives are telling the story 
 Reflecting the glory of you 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Yours is the glory 
 All of the honor 
 All of the power 
 Forever amen 
 I hear the sound of creation proclaim 
 Jesus the name that's above every name 
 Hear every nation rejoicing 
 Resounding the glory of You 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Yours is the glory 
 All of the honor 
 All of the power 
 Forever amen 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Yours is the glory 
 All of the honor 
 All of the power 
 Forever amen 
 We've never had a hope 
 Never had a hope like heaven 
 There'll never be a king 
 Never be a king like Jesus 
 We've never had a hope 
 Never had a hope like heaven 
 There'll never be a king 
 Never be a king like Jesus 
 We've never had a hope 
 Never had a hope like heaven 
 There'll never be a king 
 Never be a king like Jesus 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Yours is the glory 
 All of the honor 
 All of the power 
 Forever amen 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Yours is the glory 
 All of the honor 
 All of the power 
 Forever amen 
 All of the honor 
 All of the power 
 Forever amen

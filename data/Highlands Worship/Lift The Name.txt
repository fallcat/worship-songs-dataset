Come like you promised 
 I am desperate to see your face 
 Show me your glory 
 I need your presence everyday 
 And I will life the name of Jesus high 
 I will live my life for him 
 There is none who's loved me greater 
 Come Holy Spirit 
 Walk beside me 
 Fill my eyes 
 Show me your power 
 I'll search my heart now 
 And breathe new life 
 And I will lift the name of Jesus high 
 I will live my life for him 
 There is none who's loved me greater 
 And I will lift the name of Jesus high 
 I will live my life for him 
 And there is none who's loved me greater 
 Yeah

 And I will lift the name of Jesus high 
 I will live my life for him 
 There is none who's loved me greater 
 There is none, Lord

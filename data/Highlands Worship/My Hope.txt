My hope is in the name of Jesus 
 You are the only way 
 I give my life to You my Savior 
 You gave Your life for me 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 You lead me to Your streams of mercy 
 You meet my every need 
 When You are here darkness trembles 
 With You there is no fear 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 My hope is in the name of Jesus 
 You are the only way 
 You paid the price that I could never 
 You're more than I deserve 
 My hope is in the name of Jesus 
 You are the only way 
 I give my life to You my Savior 
 You gave Your life for me 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus 
 Oh, Your love goes on forever 
 Your love will last forever 
 Jesus, Jesus

The skies are Your design 
 You amaze me 
 Still You make Your place 
 In my heart 
 Darkness trembles at the light 
 Of Your grace 
 Still Your mercy stands 
 For me 
 You formed the corners of the earth 
 With Your hands 
 Yet You gave Your life 
 For me 
 Oceans bow at Your command 
 You're mighty 
 Still You whisper peace to me 
 Singin' 
 Hallelujah, my King is here 
 Hallelujah 
 He's robed in glory 
 All of Heaven rings 
 Hallelujah 
 How can I reply 
 To Your grace 
 Still I lift my hands 
 In worship 
 Angels marvel at the sight 
 Of Your face 
 Still You hold me in Your hands 
 Singin' 
 Hallelujah, my King is here 
 Hallelujah 
 He's robed in glory 
 All of Heaven rings 
 Singin' 
 Hallelujah, my King is here 
 Hallelujah 
 He's robed in glory 
 All of heaven rings 
 Hallelujah 
 I'll sing a new song 
 I'll tell the world of what He's done 
 Oh-oh 
 Oh-oh 
 Hallelujah 
 My King is here 
 Hallelujah 
 He's robed in glory 
 All of Heaven rings 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah

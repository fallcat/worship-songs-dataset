You call me to ascend Your glorious hill 
 Lord, without relent You beckon me still 
 To come closer, closer in Your presence to dwell 
 Cleanse and wash my hands in Your righteousness 
 Come refine my heart till all that's left 
 Is a reflection of You in all Your holiness 
 Here I am, Lord 
 Here I am, Lord 
 One moment in Your presence changes everything 
 Lord, here I am abandoned 
 Come and speak to me, come sing over me 
 Humbled and in awe at the sight of Your face 
 Your glory settles in and breaks all these chains 
 Now there is freedom, now I will never be the same 
 Here I am, Lord 
 Here I am, Lord 
 One moment in Your presence changes everything 
 Lord, here I am abandoned 
 Come and speak to me, come sing over me 
 One moment in Your presence changes everything 
 Lord, Here I am abandoned 
 Come and speak to me, come sing over me 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom and there is healing 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is hope and revelation

Lifted to the highest place 
 Name above all other names 
 Every tongue confess 
 The name of Jesus 
 Glory of the Righteous One 
 To earth from heaven rescued us 
 At the name of Jesus 
 We are saved 
 Our God reigns 
 Over all 
 The universe stands amazed 
 Hearts made whole 
 Grace for all 
 We declare our God reigns 
 Freedom now and evermore 
 On this earth we shine like stars 
 To proclaim through Jesus 
 We are saved 
 Our God reigns 
 Over all 
 The universe stands amazed 
 Hearts made whole 
 Grace for all 
 We declare our God reigns 
 You reign, You reign 
 (You reign, You reign) 
 You reign, You reign 
 (You reign, You reign) 
 You reign, You reign 
 (You reign, You reign) 
 You reign, You reign 
 (You reign, You reign) 
 Our God reigns 
 Over all 
 The universe stands amazed 
 Hearts made whole 
 Grace for all 
 We declare our God reigns 
 You reign, You reign 
 (You reign, You reign) 
 You reign, You reign 
 (You reign, You reign)

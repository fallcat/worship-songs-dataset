There's a calm that covers me 
 Where I kneel down at Your feet 
 It's a place of healing 
 It's a place where I find freedom 
 There's a place my eyes can't see 
 Where my spirit longs to be 
 It's a place of healing 
 It's a place I live in freedom 
 I'm gonna lift my hands 
 Till I can reach heaven 
 I'm gonna shout Your name 
 Till the walls come falling down 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to worship 
 There's a love that lives in me 
 For You Lord, my savior King 
 Breaks the sin that's binding 
 And brings me to a place of freedom 
 I'm gonna lift my hands 
 Till I can reach heaven 
 I'm gonna shout Your name 
 Till the walls come falling down 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to worship 
 I'm gonna sing my song 
 Like I am unashamed 
 I'm gonna shout for joy 
 At the mention of your name 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to worship 
 There is no one that can bring me peace 
 That can wash me clean like You, Lord 
 There is nothing in this world that can free me 
 You saved my soul 
 I'm gonna lift my hands 
 Till I can reach heaven 
 I'm gonna shout Your name 
 Till the walls come falling down 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to worship 
 I'm gonna sing my song 
 Like I am unashamed 
 I'm gonna shout for joy 
 At the mention of your name 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to worship

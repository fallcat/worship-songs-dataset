We're calling out to You 
 For You to see us through 
 We declare Your name over all things 
 We're lifting up Your truth 
 That You might choose to use 
 This praise to bring Your presence in us 
 Let Your glory come 
 Let Your glory come 
 We will give You our hearts 
 We offer everything 
 Send Your presence here and rain Your glory 
 As our hands we lift high 
 As our voices ring 
 From our hearts to Yours 
 Rain Your glory 
 Let Your glory fall 
 Let Your glory fall 
 Let Your glory fall 
 Fall down on us

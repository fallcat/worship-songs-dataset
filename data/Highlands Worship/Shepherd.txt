Help my heart believe 
 You are here with me 
 Lead me in Your love 
 Teach me how to trust 
 More than cold religion 
 I want You 
 I want to know You 
 I want to follow 
 Lord, be the Shepherd of my soul 
 There in the valley 
 Along the narrow way 
 Lord, be the Shepherd of my soul 
 Help my heart respond 
 Every time You call 
 Guide me in Your truth 
 Help me follow through 
 More than cold religion 
 I want You 
 I want to know You 
 I want to follow 
 Lord, be the Shepherd of my soul 
 There in the valley 
 Along the narrow way 
 Lord, be the Shepherd of my soul 
 I will dwell in Your presence 
 I will walk in Your goodness 
 Every good gift 
 Every good gift is from You 
 I will dwell in Your presence 
 I will walk in Your goodness 
 Every good gift 
 Every good gift is from You 
 I will dwell in Your presence 
 I will walk in Your goodness 
 Every good gift 
 Every good gift is from You 
 I want to know You 
 I want to follow 
 Lord, be the Shepherd of my soul 
 There in the valley 
 Along the narrow way 
 Lord, be the Shepherd of my soul 
 I will dwell in Your presence 
 I will walk in Your goodness 
 Every good gift 
 Every good gift is from You 
 I will dwell in Your presence 
 I will walk in Your goodness 
 Every good gift 
 Every good gift is from You

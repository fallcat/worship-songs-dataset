You, oh Lord 
 Alone are lifted high 
 The shadow of 
 Your wings is where I'll hide 
 You whisper 
 The oceans calm 
 You reach out 
 And I stand in awe 
 I live life to bless You 
 I sing a new song 
 The song of the rescued 
 Light of the world 
 Shine in my heart 
 Like the rise of the dawn 
 While I stand in awe 
 In this hour 
 My heart is filled with trust 
 'Cause there's no power 
 Or wonder like our God 
 You whisper 
 The oceans calm 
 You reach out 
 I stand in awe 
 I am amazed 
 Lord, who am I that You are mindful of me 
 When angels bow down 
 And heaven declares that You are God 
 You're my God

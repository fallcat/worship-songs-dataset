You're the giver of all things 
 You're the source I find my strength 
 You're the kindness in my eyes 
 You're the hope that lives inside 
 You're the grace for all my tears 
 The boldness for my fears 
 The laughter in my smile 
 You're everything to me 
 Standing 
 With my heart abandoned 
 I freely make my life 
 Completely Yours 
 Standing 
 Waiting on Your presence 
 I freely make my life 
 Completely Yours 
 You're the faith for all my doubts 
 You're the name that I cry out 
 Jesus 
 Joy of my desire 
 You're my passion, You're my fire 
 The world around me fades away 
 In the fullness of Your face 
 The world around me fades away 
 In the fullness of Your face 
 It fades away

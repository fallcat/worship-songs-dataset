There is a Redeemer 
 Jesus, God's own Son 
 Precious Lamb of God 
 Messiah 
 Holy One 
 Thank You, O my Father 
 For giving us Your Son 
 And leaving Your Spirit till 
 The work on earth is done 
 Jesus, my Redeemer 
 Name above all names 
 Precious Lamb of God 
 Messiah 
 Holy One 
 When I stand in glory 
 I will see His face 
 There I'll serve my King forever 
 In that holy place

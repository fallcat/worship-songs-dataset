I will lift up my eyes to God who saved me 
 Breathing life in the heart of His chosen One 
 For I know there's a grace that's everlasting 
 So I will look to You, Lord where my help comes from 
 I'll approach Your throne of grace 
 Hands held high and unashamed 
 You saved me, You made a way 
 Here I see You face to face 
 Finding refuge once again 
 I'm covered by, covered by Your grace 
 I will wait on You Lord, my salvation 
 You are love, bringing hope to your broken ones 
 For I know there is mercy never-ending 
 So I will cling to the cross where my heart was won 
 I'll approach Your throne of grace 
 Hands held high and unashamed 
 You saved me, You made a way 
 Here I see You face to face 
 Finding refuge once again 
 I'm covered by, covered by 
 Our Father, who art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be Your name 
 Thy Kingdom come 
 Thy will be done on earth 
 As it is in Heaven 
 Our Father, who art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be Your name 
 Thy Kingdom come 
 Thy will be done on earth 
 As it is in Heaven 
 I'll approach Your throne of grace 
 Hands held high and unashamed 
 You saved me, You made a way 
 Here I see You face to face 
 Finding refuge once again 
 I'm covered by, covered by Your grace 
 Covered by, covered by Your grace

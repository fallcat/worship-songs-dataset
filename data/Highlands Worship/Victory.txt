Hearts rejoicing, breaking silence 
 You are my God alone 
 Time to stand on Your word with passion 
 Heaven's our home 
 I can't stop giving You praise 
 Your fame will last forever 
 I won't stop living for Your name 
 Declaring Your praise 
 You're my victory, reason why I sing 
 Everything I need 
 There's no other name that deserves all praise 
 You're my victory, Jesus 
 My life transformed in Your Holy presence 
 Given to Your call alone 
 My shame is buried, I live in freedom 
 My God has won 
 I can't stop giving You praise 
 Your fame will last forever 
 I won't stop living for Your name 
 Declaring Your praise 
 You're my victory, reason why I sing 
 Everything I need 
 There's no other name that deserves all praise 
 You're my victory 
 You're my victory, reason why I sing 
 Everything I need 
 There's no other name that deserves all praise 
 You're my victory, Jesus 
 There's nothing I want more 
 To see You high and lifted up 
 There's nothing more powerful 
 Than Your name, Your name 
 There's nothing I want more 
 To see You high and lifted up 
 There's nothing more powerful 
 Than Your name, Your name 
 You're my victory, reason why I sing 
 Everything I need 
 There's no other name that deserves all praise 
 You're my victory 
 There's nothing I want more 
 To see You high and lifted up 
 There's nothing more powerful 
 Than Your name, Your name

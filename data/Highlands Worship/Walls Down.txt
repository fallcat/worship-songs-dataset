Holy Spirit 
 Come, have Your way 
 We are longing 
 For Your embrace 
 Heal injustice 
 Let Your mercy fall 
 Once indebted 
 You have paid it all 
 You are the love 
 That knows no bounds 
 A mighty power 
 That breaks walls down 
 Breaks walls down 
 Show us Your heart 
 Let Your glory shine 
 We are longing 
 To reflect Your light 
 Heal the broken 
 Give us strength to stand 
 We've been set free 
 Let us be Your hands 
 You are the love 
 That knows no bounds 
 A mighty power 
 That breaks walls down 
 Breaks walls down 
 You are the love 
 That knows no bounds 
 A mighty power 
 That breaks walls down 
 Breaks walls down 
 Love 
 Is what we call we call You 
 It's why we need You 
 It's why we follow You 
 Your love 
 Is overwhelming 
 It's all-consuming 
 Love 
 Is what we call we call You 
 It's why we need You 
 It's why we follow You 
 Your love 
 Is overwhelming 
 It's all-consuming 
 It's rescued me 
 Your love 
 You are the love 
 That knows no bounds 
 A mighty power 
 That breaks walls down 
 Breaks walls down 
 You are the love 
 That knows no bounds 
 A mighty power 
 That breaks walls down 
 Breaks walls down 
 Holy Spirit 
 Come, have Your way

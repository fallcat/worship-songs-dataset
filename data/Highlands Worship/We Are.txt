See the hope in your people's eyes 
 Seeking wonders from our God on high 
 Hear sons and daughters 
 You've called out crying out 
 We will rise 
 When we sing, we sing a song of freedom 
 For our God is with us, God is with us 
 When we dance, we dance a dance of 
 Joy for we've over come 
 We are, we are 
 Called to be your hands and feet 
 We are, we are 
 Set free moving to the rhythm of your 
 Heart beat 
 We are, we are 
 The children of your life for the world to see 
 We are, we are 
 All the night's eternity 
 Living life for it's mystery 
 Surrendered hearts falling to there knees 
 Then set them free, no compromise 
 When we sing, we sing a song of freedom 
 For our God is with us, God is with us 
 When we dance, we dance a dance of 
 Joy for we've over come 
 We are, we are 
 Called to be your hands and feet 
 We are, we are 
 Set free moving to the rhythm of your 
 Heart beat 
 We are, we are 
 The children of your life for the world to see 
 We are, we are 
 We will shout louder 
 Our is power, he holds the future 
 In his hands 
 We will shout louder 
 Our is power, he holds the future 
 In his hands, in his hands 
 We are, we are 
 Called to be your hands and feet 
 We are, we are 
 Set free moving to the rhythm of your 
 Heart beat 
 We are, we are 
 Called to be your hands and feet 
 We are, we are 
 Set free moving to the rhythm of your 
 Heart beat 
 We are, we are 
 The children of your life for the world to see 
 We are, we are 
 The children of your life for the world to see 
 The children of your life for the world to see

How great is the love 
 That You lavished on me 
 How infinite Your majesty 
 You formed the mountains 
 You calmed the raging seas 
 And redeemed this heart in me 
 You are great 
 Your mercies never fade 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Forever, forever I will sing 
 You are great 
 You are great 
 The heavens boast Your praise 
 My heart has been set free 
 Forever, forever I will sing 
 That You are great 
 You are great 
 You are great 
 You are great

When nothing seems certain 
 My faith is unshaken 
 I still believe 
 You change everything 
 When darkness surrounds me 
 God, You're still moving 
 I know I can trust 
 You change everything 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 On a cross You hung bleeding 
 My debt was deleted 
 My future is sure 
 You changed everything 
 Now the tomb, it stands empty 
 Death is defeated 
 Jesus, Your love 
 Changes everything 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Now You're seated in heaven 
 Strongholds are breaking 
 Jesus, Your name 
 Changes everything 
 Jesus, Your name 
 Changes everything 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Nothing high or low 
 Nothing else I know 
 Can separate me from Your love 
 Can separate me from Your love

God of everlasting wonder 
 You hold everything together 
 You have been and 
 You will always be 
 Maker of heaven and earth 
 Nothing could contain Your splendor 
 You have been and 
 You will always be 
 So I will never be afraid 
 For You are with me 
 I'll trust in You for all my days 
 All my hope is in You 
 All my strength is in You 
 On the mountain, in the valley 
 From the darkest depths into the sea 
 You're sovereign, Lord 
 You will always be 
 In Your arms You hold forever 
 Our present and our past and future 
 You have been and 
 You will always be 
 So I will never be afraid 
 For You are with me 
 I'll trust in You for all my days 
 All my hope is in You 
 All my strength is in You 
 On the mountain, in the valley 
 From the darkest depths into the sea 
 You're sovereign, Lord 
 You will always be 
 On the mountain, in the valley 
 From the darkest depths into the sea 
 You're sovereign, Lord 
 You will always be 
 You have walked this road before me 
 You have seen it all and shown me that 
 You have been and 
 You will always be 
 If everything I stand on ceases 
 I'll fall into Your arms Lord Jesus 
 'Cause You are there and 
 You will always be 
 All my hope is in You 
 All my strength is in You 
 On the mountain, in the valley 
 From the darkest depths into the sea 
 On the mountain, in the valley 
 From the darkest depths into the sea 
 On the mountain, in the valley 
 From the darkest depths into the sea 
 You're sovereign, Lord 
 And You will always be

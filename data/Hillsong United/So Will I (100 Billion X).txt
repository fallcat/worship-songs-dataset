God of creation 
 There at the start 
 Before the beginning of time 
 With no point of reference 
 You spoke to the dark 
 And fleshed out the wonder of light 
 And as You speak 
 A hundred billion galaxies are born 
 In the vapor of Your breath the planets form 
 If the stars were made to worship so will I 
 I can see Your heart in everything You've made 
 Every burning star 
 A signal fire of grace 
 If creation sings Your praises so will I 
 God of Your promise 
 You don't speak in vain 
 No syllable empty or void 
 For once You have spoken 
 All nature and science 
 Follow the sound of Your voice 
 And as You speak 
 A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath 
 Evolving in pursuit of what You said 
 If it all reveals Your nature so will I 
 I can see Your heart in everything You say 
 Every painted sky 
 A canvas of Your grace 
 If creation still obeys You so will I 
 So will I 
 So will I 
 If the stars were made to worship so will I 
 If the mountains bow in reverence so will I 
 If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I 
 For if everything exists to lift You high so will I 
 If the wind goes where You send it so will I 
 If the rocks cry out in silence so will I 
 If the sum of all our praises still falls shy 
 Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times 
 God of salvation 
 You chased down my heart 
 Through all of my failure and pride 
 On a hill You created 
 The light of the world 
 Abandoned in darkness to die 
 And as You speak 
 A hundred billion failures disappear 
 Where You lost Your life so I could find it here 
 If You left the grave behind You so will I 
 I can see Your heart in everything You've done 
 Every part designed in a work of art called love 
 If You gladly chose surrender so will I 
 I can see Your heart 
 Eight billion different ways 
 Every precious one 
 A child You died to save 
 If You gave Your life to love them so will I 
 Like You would again a hundred billion times 
 But what measure could amount to Your desire 
 You're the One who never leaves the one behind

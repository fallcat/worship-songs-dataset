The greatest love that anyone could ever know 
 That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul 
 And 'til I see You face to face 
 And grace amazing takes me home 
 I'll trust in You 
 With all I am I live to see Your Kingdom come 
 And in my heart I pray you'd let Your will be done 
 And 'til I see You face to face 
 And grace amazing takes me home 
 I'll trust in You 
 I will live to love You 
 I will live to bring You praise 
 I will live a child in awe of You 
 You are the voice that called the universe to be 
 You are the whisper in my heart that speaks to me 
 And 'til I see You face to face 
 And grace amazing takes me home 
 I'll trust in You 
 You alone are God of all 
 You alone are worthy Lord 
 And with all I am my soul will bless 
 Your Name

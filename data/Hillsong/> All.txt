We call out Your Name in the darkness 
 And watch as Your glory unfolds 
 For there is no measure or end 
 To the power You hold 
 Justice and truth are Your virtues 
 With many too vast for our words 
 No mind contains the splendour 
 Of all that You are 
 Our God 
 Our God has done great things 
 Our God is greater than all 
 Miracles are Your memorial 
 The promise of wonders to come 
 You are the Author 
 God You complete it all 
 All of the praise 
 Unto Your Name 
 Be lifted higher 
 All of the praise 
 Unto Your Name 
 Forever

You stand eternal 
 The uncreated One 
 Who knows no end 
 The starry wonders 
 The vast expanses 
 Bound to Your command 
 You shine like a million suns ablaze 
 Wrapped in eternal light and praise 
 Jesus the First, the Last 
 The Bright, the Morning Star 
 You spoke creation 
 Into existence 
 Life and all we are 
 Beyond all measure 
 The universe 
 An echo of Your power 
 You shine like a million suns ablaze 
 Wrapped in eternal light and praise 
 Jesus the First, the Last 
 The Bright, the Morning Star 
 (x2) 
 Everlasting 
 Never ending 
 You will reign forevermore 
 You are holy 
 You are worthy 
 Lord of all 
 (x3) 
 You shine like a million suns ablaze 
 Wrapped in eternal light and praise 
 Jesus the First, the Last 
 The Bright, the Morning Star 
 (x2)

How blessed are those who dwell in Your house 
 Who's lives become roads that You travel 
 They wind through the valley's to the light of the sun 
 One day in this beautiful place to worship 
 Your house is our home 
 Where our faces will shine in the light of the son 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns above all 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns above all 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns above all 
 Our God reigns 
 (How blessed are those who dwell in Your house) 
 Our God reigns 
 (Whose lives become roads that You travel) 
 Our God reigns 
 (They wind through the valley's) 
 Above all 
 (To the light of the sun) 
 Our God reigns, our God reigns 
 (One day in this beautiful place, to worship) 
 Our God reigns 
 (Your house is our home, where our faces) 
 Above all 
 (Will shine in the light of the sun)

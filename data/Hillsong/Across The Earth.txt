Across the earth 
 Your praises rise 
 We lift our voice 
 Call upon Your name 
 You gave us hope 
 That never ends 
 In Christ alone 
 The victory remains 
 For You are great and mighty 
 Let the nations sing 
 Your praise fills the heavens 
 For You have redeemed us 
 Our hope is in You alone 
 The cross has released us 
 To sing of Your freedom 
 By grace You make all things new 
 You came to us 
 To save our lives 
 The love of God 
 Was seen upon the cross 
 You rose again 
 The glory Yours 
 The highest praise belongs to You alone 
 For You are great and mighty 
 Let the nations sing 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 Above all 
 Above all

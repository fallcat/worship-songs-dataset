The skies lay low where You are 
 On the earth You rest Your feet 
 Yet the hands that cradle the stars 
 Are the hands that bled for me 
 In a moment of glorious surrender 
 You were broken for all the world to see 
 Lifted out of the ashes 
 I am found in the aftermath 
 Freedom found in Your scars 
 In Your grace my life redeemed 
 For You chose to take the sinner's crown 
 As You placed Your crown on me 
 And in that moment of glorious surrender 
 Was the moment You broke the chains in me 
 Lifted out of the ashes 
 I am found in the aftermath 
 And in that moment You opened up the heavens 
 To the broken, the beggar and the thief 
 Lifted out of the wreckage 
 I found hope in the aftermath 
 And I know that You're with me 
 Yes, I know that You're with me here 
 And I know Your love will light the way 
 And I know that You're with me 
 Yes, I know that You're with me here 
 And I know Your love will light the way 
 Now all I have I count it all as loss 
 But to know You, to carry the cross 
 Knowing I'm found 
 In the light of the aftermath

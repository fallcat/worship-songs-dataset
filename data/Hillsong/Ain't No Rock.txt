Ain't no rock gonna cry in my place 
 As long as I'm alive I'll glorify His holy name 
 Ain't no rock gonna cry in my place 
 As long as I'm alive I'll glorify His holy name 
 Praise His holy name! 
 As long as I'm alive I'll glorify His holy name! 
 Praise His holy name! 
 As long as I'm alive I'll glorify His holy name! 
 Ain't no tree gonna lift its branches 
 I lift my hands to glorify His holy name... 
 Ain't no bird gonna sing in my place 
 I lift my voice to glorify His holy name...

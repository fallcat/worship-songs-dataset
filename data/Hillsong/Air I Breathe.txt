Hold me, in your arms 
 Like a new born child 
 I'm desperate, lord 
 For more of you 
 Touch me, with your love 
 Deep within my heart 
 I'm waiting, lord 
 For more of you 
 May your words of love 
 Wash over me 
 May your songs of grace 
 Cover me 
 More than the air I breathe today 
 I need you 
 More than the desert needs the rain 
 I need you 
 More than the air breathe today 
 I need you 
 More than to live another day 
 I need you

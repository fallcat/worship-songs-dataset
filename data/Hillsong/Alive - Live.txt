I was lost with a broken heart 
 You picked me up now I'm set apart 
 From the ash I'm born again 
 Forever safe in the saviors hands 
 You are more than my words could say 
 I'll follow you for all my days 
 Fix my eyes follow in your ways 
 Forever free in unending grace 
 You are, you are, you are my freedom 
 We lift you higher, we lift you higher 
 Your love, your love, your love never ending 
 You are alive in us 
 Nothing can take your place 
 You are all we need 
 Your love has set us free 
 In the midst of the darkest night 
 Let your love be the shining light 
 Breaking chains that were holding me 
 You sent your son down and set me free 
 Everything of this world will fade 
 Pressing on till I see your face 
 I will live that your will be done 
 I won't stop till your kingdom come 
 You are, you are, you are my freedom 
 We lift you higher, we lift you higher 
 Your love, your love, your love never ending 
 You are alive in us 
 Nothing can take your place 
 You are all we need 
 Your love has set us free 
 You are, you are, you are my freedom 
 We lift you higher, we lift you higher 
 Your love, your love, your love never ending

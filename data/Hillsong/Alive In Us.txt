Great is Your love 
 Let the whole earth sing 
 Let the whole earth sing 
 You reached for us 
 From on heaven's throne 
 When we had no hope 
 You are the way 
 There is no other 
 You are the way 
 There is no other 
 You rose from death to victory 
 You reign in life 
 Oh majesty 
 Your name be high and lifted up 
 Jesus, Jesus alive in us 
 You outshine the sun 
 You are glorious 
 You are glorious 
 Lord over all 
 You have made us new 
 We owe it all to You 
 In everything 
 Be exalted 
 In everything 
 Be exalted 
 You rose from death to victory 
 You reign in life 
 Oh majesty 
 Your name be high and lifted up 
 Jesus, Jesus alive in us 
 The enemy is under Your feet 
 We are free 
 We are free 
 Death has been defeated by love 
 You overcome 
 You overcome 
 The enemy is under Your feet 
 We are free 
 We are free 
 Death has been defeated by love 
 You overcome 
 You overcome 
 You rose from death to victory 
 You reign in life 
 Oh majesty 
 Your name be high and lifted up 
 Jesus, Jesus alive in us 
 Jesus, Jesus alive in us

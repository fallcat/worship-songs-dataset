Hear our praises 
 Hear Your people sing 
 Hear our hearts cry 
 Your love is everything 
 And all will hear this shout 
 As the nations turn to You 
 And this will be our anthem 
 'Cause were all about You 
 And the world You promise 
 And all we have will give You praise 
 'Cause were all about You 
 And the world can't stop us 
 Living Your way, always 
 Let our hearts break 
 As we praise Your name 
 Let the earth shake 
 This is the sound of faith 
 And the walls will fall down 
 And religion will break 
 And the nations will hear this shout 
 Can you hear the sound of faith? 
 All the walls are falling down 
 As the nations praise... 
 And all the world will hear this shout 
 Can you hear the sound of faith?

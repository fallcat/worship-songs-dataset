I don't care what they say about me 
 It's all right, all right 
 I don't care they think about me 
 It's all right, they'll get it one day 
 I love you, I'll follow you 
 You are my, my life 
 I will read my bible and pray 
 I will follow you all day 
 I don't care what it costs anymore 
 'Cause you gave it all and I'm following you 
 I don't care what it takes anymore 
 No matter what happens I'm going your way 
 All Day 
 All Day now 
 All Day 
 Anyone around can see 
 Just how good you've been to me 
 For all my friends that don't know you 
 I pray that you would save them too

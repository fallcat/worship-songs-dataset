All for love a Father gave 
 For only love could make a way 
 All for love the heavens cried 
 For love was crucified 
 Oh how many times have I broken Your heart 
 But still You forgive 
 If only I ask 
 And how many times have You heard me pray 
 Draw near to me 
 Everything I need is You 
 My beginning, my forever 
 Everything I need is You 
 Let me sing all for love 
 I will join the angel song 
 Ever holy is the Lord 
 King of Glory 
 King of all 
 Oh how many times have I broken Your heart 
 But still You forgive 
 If only I ask 
 And how many times have You heard me pray 
 Draw near to me 
 Everything I need is You 
 My beginning, my forever 
 Everything I need is You (x2) 
 All for a love a Saviour prayed 
 Abba Father have Your way 
 Though they know not what they do 
 Let the Cross draw man to You 
 Everything I need is You 
 My beginning, my forever 
 Everything I need is You (x2)

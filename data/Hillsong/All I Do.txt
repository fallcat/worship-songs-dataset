I wanted to find 
 (Where I was going) 
 Everything I tried 
 (It took me nowhere) 
 I was so tired of just living my life 
 Waiting for a sign 
 You came to my side 
 (Gave me direction) 
 Strong on the inside 
 (I shine for You Lord) 
 Now it's my time 
 I have made up my mind 
 To be all You want for me 
 All I do is live my life for You 
 I know it's true, I'll never let You go 
 All I do, I'd do anything for You 
 Everything is in Your hands 
 So I get up, get up and praise You

You hold the universe, You hold everyone on earth 
 You hold the universe, You hold and You hold 
 Psalm 139:13-18 (New Living Translation) 
 You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body 
 And knit me together in my mother's womb. 
 Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! 
 Your workmanship is marveloushow well I know it. 
 You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, 
 As I was woven together in the dark of the womb. 
 You saw me before I've born. 
 Every day of my life was recorded in your book. 
 Every moment was laid out 
 Before a single day had passed. 
 How precious are your thoughts about me, Oh God. 
 They cannot be numbered! 
 I can't even count them; 
 They outnumber the grains of sand! 
 And when I wake up in the morning, 
 You are still with me! 
 All I need is You, All I need is You Lord, is You Lord 
 You are my world, You are my God 
 And I lay down my life for You 
 You are my world, the One I love 
 No one could ever take Your place

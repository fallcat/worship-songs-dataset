Light in my darkness 
 Peace for my soul 
 You are my rescue 
 You've never let go 
 All my hope is in You 
 All my strength is in You 
 With every breath 
 My soul will rest in You 
 Here in my weakness 
 Always the same 
 Your love is my shelter 
 Your life is my way 
 Constant Saviour 
 Friend forever 
 Lord You have my heart 
 Sure foundation 
 Never failing 
 Lord You have my heart 
 All the earth beneath You 
 All my life before You 
 With every breath 
 My soul will rest in You

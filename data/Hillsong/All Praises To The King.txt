What a joy I feel to think about forever 
 I'm a child of God with blessings from Heaven 
 By Your side, days always brighter 
 The Holy one, my Master, my Father 
 I will dwell in Your courts 
 I will sing for You 
 You're my deepest love 
 Jesus, I love You 
 It's a love song, I sing 
 It's an anthem from my heart 
 All praises to the King 
 From the depths of my soul 
 I adore You my Savior 
 All praises to the King 
 I am not alone, Jesus, You're near me 
 Washed me clean with hands full of mercy 
 You're a resting place for all who are weary 
 A perfect place and a new beginning 
 I will dwell in Your courts 
 I will sing for You 
 You're my deepest love 
 Jesus, I love You 
 It's a love song, I sing 
 It's an anthem from my heart 
 All praises to the King 
 From the depths of my soul 
 I adore You my Savior 
 All praises to the King 
 All praises, all praises 
 All praises, all praises 
 (Hallelujah, I praise You) 
 It's a love song, I sing 
 It's an anthem from my heart 
 All praises to the King 
 From the depths of my soul 
 I adore You my Savior 
 All praises to the King 
 All praises to the King 
 All praises to the King

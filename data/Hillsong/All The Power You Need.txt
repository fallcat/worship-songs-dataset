My God can never fail 
 He's been proved time and again 
 Trust Him, you'll see 
 He's got all the power you need 
 He's never early, never late 
 It takes courage and it takes faith 
 Trust Him, you'll see 
 He's go all the power you need 
 He saves, forgives and heals 
 Takes back what the devil steals 
 My debt's been paid in full 
 And every day, He does miracles 
 I got dreams, turn them into plans 
 Too big for human hands 
 Trust Him, you'll see 
 He's got all the power you need 
 He's real, He's real 
 Faith's a lot stronger 
 Than what you feel 
 He's real, He's real 
 I'm believing for miracles 
 Trust Him, you'll see 
 He's got all the power you need 
 All the power you need

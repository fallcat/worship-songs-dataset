Almighty God my redeemer 
 My hiding place my safe refuge, no other name like Jesus 
 No power can stand against You. 
 My feet are planted on this rock 
 And I will not be shaken 
 My hope it comes from You alone 
 My Lord and my salvation 
 Your praise is always on my lips 
 Your word is living in my heart 
 And I will praise You with a new song, My soul will bless You Lord 
 You fill my life with greater joy 
 Yes I delight myself in You 
 And I will praise You with a new song, My soul will bless You, Lord 
 When I am weak, you make me strong 
 When I'm poor, I know I'm rich for in the power of Your name 
 All things are possible 
 All things are possible 
 All things are possible

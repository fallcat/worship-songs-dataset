Your love's making all things new 
 You're working in all for good 
 For the things of this world 
 There is hope renewed 
 In the life that is found in You 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 Yesterday and forever 
 Your love never changing 
 This hope never fading 
 Hallelujah 
 My faith is in things unseen 
 Bringing life where it has not been 
 Speaking things that are not 
 As if they were 
 I am alive in You 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 Yesterday and forever 
 Your love never changing 
 This hope never fading 
 Hallelujah 
 The heavens have been opened 
 I know that I am chosen 
 For I am alive in You 
 I am alive in You 
 God You are restoring 
 All things for Your glory 
 I am alive in You 
 I am alive in You 
 (x2) 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 Yesterday and forever 
 Your love never changing 
 This hope never fading 
 Hallelujah 
 Yesterday and forever 
 Your love never changing 
 This hope never fading 
 Hallelujah

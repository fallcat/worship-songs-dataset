You're the one who gives me shelter 
 And You're the light that leads me home 
 You're the love that gave forever 
 Lord You're all that I know 
 And all that I am 
 Unto You I surrender 
 Lord there is none like You 
 And I know that I stand 
 In the arms of forever 
 Lord there is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 With the world upon Your shoulders 
 Lord You gave Your life away 
 If the world I know was over 
 I know I'd have life in the price You paid 
 And I will stand 
 And I will worship You forever 
 For all You are 
 And I will stand 
 And all to You I will surrender 
 I'll worship You forever

You're the one who give shelter 
 And you're the light that leads me home 
 You're the love that gave forever... 
 Lord you're all that I know 
 And all that I am... unto you I surrender... 
 Lord there is none like you 
 And I know that I stand... in the arms of forever... 
 Lord there is none like you 
 There is none like you 
 With the world upon your shoulders... 
 Lord you gave your life away 
 If the world I know was over... 
 I know I'd have life in the price you paid 
 And I will stand... and I will worship you forever... 
 For all you are 
 And I will stand... and all to you I will surrender... 
 I'll worship you forever

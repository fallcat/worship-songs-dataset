Where I go You will go 
 You never leave me 
 When I'm lost there's always hope 
 In ev'ry high in ev'ry low 
 You're standing next to me 
 In the fire there's always hope 
 I will lift my eyes let my heart cry out 
 You're alive alive 
 With an anthem we raise up our voice proclaim 
 You're alive alive 
 Your love keeps chasing me 
 And it always will it always will 
 Your grace keeps changing me 
 And it always will it always will 
 Oh 
 In my joy in my pain 
 You're right beside me 
 In Your arms there's always hope 
 When I fall You are there 
 Your mercy will catch me 
 All my hope in Christ alone 
 Your love keeps chasing me 
 And it always will it always will 
 Your grace keeps changing me 
 And it always will it always will 
 You gave Your life away 
 Once and for all 
 Once and for all 
 Forever You will reign and You always will 
 You always will 
 (Oh) 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh

Whenever I lift my hands 
 Whenever I call Your name 
 You're there 
 Whenever I speak to you 
 Whenever I seek your face 
 You're there 
 In the secret place 
 I'll be found with You 
 'Cause You're always there 
 'Cause You're always there Jesus 
 I'll be found with You 
 And I'll stay always with You 
 Always with You

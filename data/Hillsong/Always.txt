Did You rise the sun for me? 
 Or paint a million stars that I might 
 Know Your majesty? 
 Is Your voice upon the wind? 
 Is everything I've known marked 
 With my maker's fingerprints? 
 Breathe on me 
 Let me see Your face 
 Ever I will seek You 
 'Cause all You are, is all I want, always 
 Draw me close in Your arms 
 Oh God, I wanna be with You 
 Can I feel You in the rain? 
 Abandon all I am to have You 
 Capture me again 
 Let the earth resound with praise 
 Can You hear as all creation lives 
 To glorify one name?

Am I to believe... 
 That a God would give his son? 
 Am I to believe... 
 That the world was brought with love? 
 Am I to believe... 
 That a stranger died for me? 
 Am I to believe... 
 That a saviour set me free? 
 'Cause I have felt the could rain... 
 Run down my face 
 I've seen the sun rise up... 
 As the night turns to day 
 I've heard the laughter... 
 As the children play 
 But above all 
 I juat live to say that... 
 Yeah, oh yeah 
 I believe in the God love 
 Yeah, oh yeah 
 I believe in the risen son 
 Am I to believe... 
 That the sick shall overcome? 
 Am I to believe... 
 That my freedom has been won? 
 I blieve in you...

I'm so amazed at how You take my life 
 And love me more, more than I deserve 
 I'm blown away by Your power to change this life 
 Once more, I'm planted in You 
 Who would know that I was once 
 On a road so far away from You 
 All I know is that I live my life 
 To show the world Your amazing love 
 Your amazing love 
 Your love is pure, Your love so divine 
 Your love transforms my soul, my mind 
 Your love has the power to bring new hope 
 Amazing love, amazing love 
 I'm so amazed at the wonder of all creation 
 I will live to honor You my Lord 
 You are the gold, treasure of all life 
 I will rest in You in praise eternally 
 Who would know that I was once 
 On a road so far away from You 
 All I know is that I live my life 
 To show the world Your amazing love 
 You're amazing 
 Your love is so pure, Your love so divine 
 Your love transforms my soul my mind 
 Your love has the power to bring new hope 
 Amazing love, amazing love 
 Your love is pure, Your love so divine 
 Your love transforms my soul, my mind 
 Your love has the power to bring new hope 
 Amazing love, amazing love 
 I'm so amazed

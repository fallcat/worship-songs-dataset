I have this hope 
 As an anchor for my soul 
 Through ev'ry storm 
 I will hold to You 
 With endless love 
 All my fear is swept away 
 In ev'rything 
 I will trust in You 
 There is hope in the promise of the cross 
 You gave ev'rything to save the world You love 
 And this hope is an anchor for my soul 
 Our God will stand unshakable 
 Unchanging One 
 Who was and is to come 
 Your promise sure 
 You will not let go 
 Your Name is higher 
 Your Name is greater 
 All my hope is in You 
 Your word unfailing 
 Your promise unshaken 
 All my hope is in You

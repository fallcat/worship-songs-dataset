Blessing and honor, 
 Glory and power, 
 Be unto the Ancient of Days. 
 From every nation, 
 All of creation, 
 Bow before the Ancient of Days. 
 Every tongue in heaven and earth, 
 Shall declare Your glory, 
 Every knee shall bow at Your throne, 
 In worship. 
 You will be exalted O God, 
 And Your Kingdom shall not pass away. 
 Oh Ancient of Days. 
 Your Kingdom shall reign over all the earth, 
 Sing unto the Ancient of Days. 
 For none can compare to Your matchless worth, 
 Sing unto the Ancient of Days.

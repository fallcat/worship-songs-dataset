You make Your face to shine on me 
 And that my soul knows very well 
 You lift me up, I'm cleansed and free 
 And that my soul knows very well 
 When mountains fall, I'll stand 
 By the power of Your hand 
 And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell 
 And that my soul knows very well 
 Joy and strength each day I find 
 And that my soul knows very well 
 Forgiveness, hope, I know is mine 
 And that my soul knows very well

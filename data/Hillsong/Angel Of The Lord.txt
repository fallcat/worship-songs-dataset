The Lord's my Shepherd, I have everything I need 
 Mercy and love follow me 
 Though I walk through the dark valley of death, I will 
 Not be afraid for He's here 
 The Lord's my refuge, no evil can come near me 
 Dwelling in His secret place 
 I put my trust in Him, He is my shield, I will 
 Let His peace rule in my heart 
 Surely, the Angel of the Lord is around me 
 I have no cause to fear, my God will not forsake me 
 I am His child, now no enemy can touch me 
 I will not die but live to tell what He has done 
 He has ransomed me, He gave me all authority 
 Power, love and a sound mind 
 Strong in the Lord and the power of His might, I will 
 Put on His amour and stand 
 Surely, the Angel of the Lord is around me 
 I have no cause to fear, my God will not forsake me 
 I am my Father's child, now no enemy can touch me 
 I will not die but live to tell what He has done 
 I know, surely, the Angel of the Lord is around me 
 I have no cause to fear, my God will not forsake me 
 I am my Father's child, now no enemy can touch me 
 I will not die but live to tell what He has done

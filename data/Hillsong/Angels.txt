The holiest place there could ever be 
 All you can do is bow 
 Before the One who made Heaven and earth 
 Before the almighty God 
 For Him alone 
 Sing with the angels 
 Sing with the angels 
 Singing the name of the Lord 
 Singing the name of the Lord 
 For every soul He gave it all 
 Given for all of mankind 
 Eternal life is His alone 
 Given to all who believe 
 In Him alone 
 Jesus, Jesus

For you, I'd climb the highest height 
 I'd dive the deepest sea 
 Search for more of you 
 For you, I'd fall upon my knees 
 Cry out night and day 
 Search for more of you 
 And I would give my riches away 
 They're nothing without you 
 Something to live for 
 Something worth dying for 
 Has taken my heart 
 Someone to follow 
 In good or in troubled times 
 I'd give all I have 
 Do Anything for you 
 Anything for you 
 Do Anything for you 
 Anything for you 
 Do Anything for you (Anything for you) 
 Anything for you (Anything for you) 
 Anything for you (Anything for you) 
 Anything for you (Anything for you) 
 Anything for you (Anything for you) 
 Anything for you 
 Anything for you

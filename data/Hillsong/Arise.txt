Explorers and soldiers in you and in I 
 Searching and fighting till love is realised 
 Straight through our souls with invisible thread 
 The pieces undone are whole now instead 
 The fight we're in has already been won 
 Arise 
 For the kingdom has come 
 Arise 
 For the kingdom has come 
 We're storyboards made of beauty and soul 
 We're closer to heaven than we'll ever know 
 Woven and tied with scarlet string 
 To breathe and create a sacred thing 
 The fight we're in has already been won

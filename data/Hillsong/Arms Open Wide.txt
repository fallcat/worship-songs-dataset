Take my life, I lay it down 
 At the cross where I am found 
 All I have I give to You, oh God 
 Take my hands and make them clean 
 Keep my heart in purity 
 That I may walk in all You have for me 
 Oh, here I stand arms open wide 
 Oh, I am Yours and You are mine Jesus 
 Take my moments and my days 
 Let each breath that I take 
 Be ever only for You, oh God 
 Oh, here I stand arms open wide 
 Oh, I am Yours and You are mine 
 Oh, here I stand arms open wide 
 Oh, I am Yours and You are mine, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 My whole life is Yours, I give it all 
 Surrendered to Your name 
 And forever I will pray 
 Have Your way, have Your way 
 My whole life is Yours, I give it all 
 Surrendered to Your name 
 And forever I will pray 
 Have Your way, have Your way 
 Oh, here I stand arms open wide 
 Oh, I am Yours and You are mine 
 Oh, here I stand arms open wide 
 Oh, I am Yours and You are mine 
 Oh, here I stand arms open wide, yeah 
 Oh, I am Yours and You are mine 
 My whole life is Yours, I give it all 
 Surrendered to Your name 
 And forever I will pray 
 Have Your way, have Your way 
 My whole life is Yours, I give it all 
 Surrendered to Your name 
 And forever I will pray 
 Have Your way, have Your way Jesus

Whether now or then 
 Death is not my end 
 I know Heaven waits for me 
 Though the road seems long 
 I'll never walk alone 
 And I got all I need to sing 
 I know You love me 
 I know You found me 
 I know You saved me 
 And Your grace will never fail me 
 And while I'm waiting 
 I'm not waiting 
 I know Heaven lives in me 
 Should I suffer long 
 This is not my home 
 I know Heaven waits for me 
 And though the night is dark 
 Heaven owns my heart 
 And I got all I need to sing 
 I know You love me 
 I know You found me 
 I know You saved me 
 And Your grace will never fail me 
 And while I'm waiting 
 I'm not waiting 
 I know Heaven lives in me 
 So I will sing like I will there 
 In the fearless light of glory 
 Where the darkness cannot find me 
 And Your face is all I see 
 Oh I will sing like a man 
 With no sickness in my body 
 Like no prison walls can hold me 
 I will sing like I am free 
 'Cause I know You love me 
 I know You found me 
 I know You saved me 
 And Your grace will never fail me 
 And while I'm waiting 
 I'm not waiting 
 I know Heaven lives in me 
 I know You love me 
 I know You found me 
 I know You saved me 
 And Your grace will never fail me 
 And while I'm waiting 
 I'm not waiting 
 I know Heaven lives in me 
 So I will sing like I will there 
 In the fearless light of glory 
 Where the darkness cannot find me 
 And Your face is all I see 
 Oh I will sing like a man 
 With no sickness in my body 
 Like no prison walls can hold me 
 I will sing like I am free 
 'Cause I know You love me 
 I know You found me 
 I know You saved me 
 And Your grace will never fail me 
 And while I'm waiting 
 Oh I'm not waiting 
 I know Heaven lives in me 
 I'll sing holy, holy 
 My heart cries holy 
 As it is in heaven 
 It is in me 
 I'll sing holy, holy 
 My heart cries holy 
 As it is in heaven 
 It is in me 
 We'll sing holy, holy 
 The earth cries holy 
 As it is in heaven 
 So let it be 
 We'll sing holy, holy 
 The earth cries holy 
 As it is in heaven 
 So let it be 
 We'll sing holy, holy 
 The earth cries holy 
 As it is in heaven 
 So let it be 
 We'll sing holy, holy 
 The earth cries holy 
 As it is in heaven 
 So let it be

Oh Lord, You've searched me 
 You know my way 
 Even when I fail You 
 I know You love me 
 Your holy presence 
 Surrounding me 
 In every season 
 I know You love me 
 I know You love me 
 At the cross I bow my knee 
 Where Your blood was shed for me 
 There's no greater love than this 
 You have overcome the grave 
 Your glory fills the highest place 
 What can separate me now 
 You go before me 
 You shield my way 
 Your hand upholds me 
 I know You love me 
 At the cross I bow my knee 
 Where Your blood was shed for me 
 There's no greater love than this 
 You have overcome the grave 
 Your glory fills the highest place 
 What can separate me now 
 At the cross I bow my knee 
 Where Your blood was shed for me 
 There's no greater love than this 
 You have overcome the grave 
 Your glory fills the highest place 
 What can separate me now 
 You tore the veil 
 You made a way 
 When You said that it is done 
 You tore the veil 
 You made a way 
 When You said that it is done 
 And when the earth fades 
 Falls from my eyes 
 And You stand before me 
 I know You love me 
 I know You love me 
 At the cross I bow my knee 
 Where Your blood was shed for me 
 There's no greater love than this 
 You have overcome the grave 
 Your glory fills the highest place 
 What can separate me now 
 At the cross I bow my knee 
 Where Your blood was shed for me 
 There's no greater love than this 
 You have overcome the grave 
 Your glory fills the highest place 
 What can separate me now 
 You tore the veil 
 You made a way 
 When You said that it is done 
 You tore the veil 
 You made a way 
 When You said that it is done 
 You tore the veil 
 You made a way 
 When You said that it is done 
 You tore the veil 
 You made a way 
 When You said that it is done

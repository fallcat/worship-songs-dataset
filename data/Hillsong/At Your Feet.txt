I bow my head unto You again 
 Seated at Your feet 
 Let unfailing love wash over me 
 Set my path, lift my eyes 
 To seek my Savior 
 Fill my life with the love of Christ 
 Mercy of the Savior has changed my life 
 Now I stand here right upon salvation 
 Such grace revealed in my careless way 
 Humbled by Your love 
 Let Your faithfulness sing over me 
 Stir this heart, oh Lord 
 To seek my Savior 
 Fill my life with the love of Christ 
 Mercy of the Savior has changed my life 
 Now I stand here right upon salvation 
 Fill my life with the love of Christ 
 Mercy of the Savior has changed my life 
 Now I stand here right upon salvation 
 My Jesus, I fall at Your feet 
 And surrender all that is made 
 To seek my Savior, to glorify my Savior 
 My Jesus, I fall at Your feet 
 And surrender all that is made 
 To seek my Savior, to glorify my Savior 
 Fill my life with the love of Christ 
 Mercy of the Savior has changed my life 
 Now I stand here right upon salvation

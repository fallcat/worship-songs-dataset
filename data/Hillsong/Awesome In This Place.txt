Here in this house of the great King 
 We come together now to worship Him 
 This house is built on Christ our rock 
 Cannot be shaken, cannot be shaken 
 God is awesome in this place 
 We sense His presence as we sing His praise 
 There is power here for a miracle 
 Set the captives free, make the broken whole 
 God is awesome, He's so awesome 
 God is awesome in this place

Here in my heart You have found Your place 
 Replacing fear with Your freedom 
 You lift me up 
 You lift me up 
 When all seems lost in my brokenness 
 I call Your Name and You answer 
 Held by Your love 
 Held by Your love 
 In the night 
 Through the struggle, through the trial 
 You have made my burden light 
 You have brought me back to life again 
 Your love it wipes every tear away 
 You calm the storms that surround me 
 You carry me 
 You carry me 
 Your light breaks through in my darkest hour 
 Your love is strong in my weakness 
 You are enough 
 You are enough 
 You won't let go 
 So I will follow 
 All I am 
 Yours now and forever 
 You won't let go 
 So I will follow 
 With all I am 
 In the night 
 Through the struggle, through the trial 
 You have made my burden light 
 You have brought me back to life again 
 You won't let go 
 So I will follow 
 All I am 
 Yours now and forever 
 You won't let go 
 So I will follow 
 With all I am 
 You won't let go 
 So I will follow 
 All I am 
 Yours now and forever 
 You won't let go 
 So I will follow 
 With all I am 
 In the night 
 Through the struggle, through the trial 
 You have made my burden light 
 You have brought me back to life again

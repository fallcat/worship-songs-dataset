Be still and know 
 That the Lord is in control 
 Be still, my soul 
 Stand and watch as giants fall 
 I won't be afraid for You are here 
 You silence all my fear 
 I won't be afraid, You don't let go 
 Be still, my heart, and know 
 I won't be afraid 
 Be still and trust 
 What the Lord has said is done 
 Find rest, don't strive 
 Watch as faith and grace align 
 I won't be afraid for You are here 
 You silence all my fear 
 I won't be afraid, You don't let go 
 Be still, my heart, and know 
 I won't be afraid 
 I won't be afraid

You were near though I was distant 
 Disillusioned I was lost and insecure 
 Still mercy fought for my redemption 
 You were waiting at the door, then I let You in 
 Trading Your life for my offenses 
 For my redemption 
 You carried all the blame breaking the curse 
 Of our condition 
 Perfection took our place 
 When only love could make a way 
 You gave Your life in a beautiful exchange 
 When only love could break these chains 
 You gave Your life in a beautiful exchange 
 My burden erased, my life forgiven 
 There is nothing that could take this love away 
 And my only desire, and my sole ambition 
 Is to love You just the same 
 Holy are You God, holy is Your name 
 With everything I've got my heart will sing 
 How I love You

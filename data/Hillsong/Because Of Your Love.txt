(Words and music Russell Frager) 
 Because of Your love 
 Everything's changed 
 Because of Your love 
 I'll never be the same 
 Your love is perfect 
 And I'll never be afraid 
 Because of Your love 
 Everything's changed 
 Because of Your grace 
 Everything's changed 
 Because of Your grace 
 I'll never be the same 
 Your favour undeserved 
 The precious gift You gave 
 Because of Your grace 
 Everything's changed 
 I have this confidence 
 That God is on my side 
 All of my days are in Your hands 
 Love so amazing 
 That it cannot be denied 
 That every day I'm in Your plan

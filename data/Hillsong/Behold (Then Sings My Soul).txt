Behold the Father's heart 
 The mystery He lavishes on us 
 As deep cries out to deep 
 Oh, how desperately He wants us 
 The things of earth stand next to him 
 Like a candle to the sun 
 Unfailing Father 
 What compares to His great love 
 Behold His holy Son 
 The Lion and the Lamb given to us 
 The Word became a man 
 That my soul should know its Saviour 
 Forsaken for the sake of all mankind 
 Salvation is in His blood 
 Jesus Messiah 
 The righteous died for love 
 It wasn't over 
 For He is the risen One 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great Your love is 
 How great Your love is 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great Your love is 
 How great Your love is 
 Then sings my soul 
 Behold I have a friend 
 The Spirit breathing holy fire within 
 My ever present help 
 Speaking truth when I can't find it 
 Light up this broken heart and light my way 
 'Til my time on earth is done 
 Oh, Holy Spirit 
 Breathe in me like kingdom come 
 Oh, Holy Spirit 
 Let Your work in me be done 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great Your love is 
 How great Your love is 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great Your love is 
 How great Your love is 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great Your love is 
 How great Your love is 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great Your love is 
 How great Your love is 
 Then sings my soul 
 My God 
 He who was and is to come 
 Prepare the way 
 Until the work on earth is done 
 Watch as the clouds He rides swing low 
 Lift up the sound 
 As He makes our praise His throne 
 Behold the Lord our God will lead us home

You are my light 
 You are my strength 
 You are my Rock 
 On You I stand 
 I lift my voice 
 I raise my hands 
 I lift my soul 
 With all I am 
 In Christ forever I'll stand 
 I will believe 
 You are strong enough 
 In my weakness 
 God be lifted up 
 And I will sing 
 Lift Your praises high 
 Lord be magnified 
 You make all things new 
 I will believe 
 So, hear this song 
 Receive our praise 
 You are our strength 
 For all our days 
 We lift You up 
 Our voices high 
 In every storm 
 Let God arise 
 Oh, Your love 
 Your love it never fails 
 Your love, it knows no end 
 Your love will never fail 
 Oh, Your love 
 Stronger than my shame 
 Greater than my pain 
 Your love will never fail 
 I will believe

This is my revelation 
 Christ Jesus crucified 
 Salvation through repentance 
 At the cross on which He died 
 Now here my absolution 
 Forgiveness for my sin 
 And I sink beneath the waters 
 That Christ was buried in 
 I will rise (But now I rise) 
 I will rise 
 As Christ was raised to life 
 Now in Him 
 Now in Him 
 I live 
 I stand a new creation 
 Baptised in blood and fire 
 No fear of condemnation 
 By faith I'm justified 
 I rise as You are risen 
 Declare Your rule and reign 
 My life confess Your Lordship 
 And glorify Your Name 
 Your word it stands eternal 
 Your kingdom knows no end 
 Your praise goes on forever 
 And on and on again 
 No power can stand against You 
 No curse assault Your throne 
 No one can steal Your glory 
 For it is Yours alone 
 I stand to sing Your praises 
 I stand to testify 
 For I was dead in my sin

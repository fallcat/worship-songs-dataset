Better than the riches of this world Better than the sound of my friends voices 
 Better than the biggest dreams in my heart and that's just the start 
 Better than getting what I say I need Better than living the life that I wan't to 
 Better than the love anyone could give 
 Your love is 
 You hold me now in Your arms and never let me go 
 And You oh Lord made the sunshine and the moonlight in the nightsky 
 You give me breath and all Your love 
 I give my heart to You 
 Because I can't stop falling in love with You 
 I'll never stop falling in love with You

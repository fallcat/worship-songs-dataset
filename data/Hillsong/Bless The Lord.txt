To you my love, my joy, my song 
 I lift my voice, my heart and soul 
 In worship 
 As eagles soar across the sky 
 So my spirit reaches high 
 Toward you 
 As the deer pants for the water so 
 My soul cries for you 
 As a child has rest in arms of love 
 So I rest in you 
 You are the great and mighty 
 Risen lord my king of glory 
 Oh my soul bless the lord 
 You reign in strength and power 
 Awesome god my strong tower 
 Oh my soul bless the lord

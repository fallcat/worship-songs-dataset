Blessed are those who dwell in Your house 
 They are ever praising You 
 Blessed are those whose strength is in You 
 Whose hearts are set on our God 
 We will go from strength to strength 
 Until we see You face to face 
 Hear our prayer 
 Oh Lord, God almighty 
 Come bless our land 
 As we seek You 
 Worship You 
 For You are holy 
 For You are holy 
 For You are holy, Lord

You can take my dry bones 
 Breathe life into this skin 
 You called me by name 
 Raised me to life again 
 You can calm the oceans 
 Speak peace into my soul 
 Take me as I am 
 Awaken my heart to beat again 
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Alive in me 
 You move in the unseen 
 You set the captives free 
 As I stand and sing 
 You're breaking the chains off me 
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Alive in me, alive in me 
 Alive in me, alive in me 
 Alive in me, alive in me, alive in me 
 Breathe in me Your life 
 I can feel You are close now 
 I can never hide 
 You are here and You know me 
 All I need is You and I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 Breathe in me Your life 
 Till Your love overtakes me 
 Open up my eyes 
 Let me see You more clearly 
 Falling on my knees till I love like You love 
 Like You love me, I love You 
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Alive in me

Would you believe me, would you listen if I told you that 
 There is a love that makes the way, it never holds you back 
 So won't you break free, won't you break free, get up and dance, in His love 
 So won't you break free, won't you break free, get up and dance, in His love 
 Who would have thought that God would give His one and only Son 
 Taken a stand upon the cross to show His perfect love 
 So won't you break free, won't you break free, get up and dance, in His love 
 So won't you break free, won't you break free, get up and dance, in His love 
 His love never ending 
 There's no escaping the truth, there's no mistaking it's You 
 God, forever we'll get up and dance, get up and dance and praise You 
 Now is the time to take this freedom that has come our way 
 Offer our lives to see the glory of Your name 
 So won't you break free, won't you break free, get up and dance, in His love 
 So won't you break free, won't you break free, get up and dance, in His love 
 His love never ending 
 There's no escaping the truth, there's no mistaking it's You 
 God, forever we'll get up and dance, get up and dance and praise You 
 There's no escaping Your love, there's no mistaking Your light 
 Across the world we will get up and dance, get up and dance and praise You 
 And for all our days 
 We are holding on, holding on to all Your ways 
 We are holding on, holding on to all You've said and You've done 
 We are holding on to Your love 
 Now we will dance

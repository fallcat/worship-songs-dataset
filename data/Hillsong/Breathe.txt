Give me a heart to change the world 
 Let me see miracles be done 
 Lord I know Your love stands strong, strengthen me 
 I want the broken lifted high 
 I dream to reunite young lives 
 With generations side by side, strengthen me 
 Always forever to eternity my eyes are locked on You 
 Help me Lord to reach the lost for You, I trust in 
 You 
 Breathe in my heart, breathe in my soul 
 Give me love to love someone 
 Show me Your way, show me Your truth 
 Holy Spirit flow through me 
 Give me a heart to change the world 
 Let me see miracles be done 
 Lord I know Your love stands strong, strengthen me 
 Always forever to eternity my eyes are locked on You 
 Help me Lord to reach the lost for You, I trust in 
 You 
 Breathe in my heart, breathe in my soul 
 Give me love to love someone 
 Show me Your way, show me Your truth 
 Holy Spirit flow through me 
 I love You, I need You Lord 
 I love You, I need You Lord 
 Breathe in my heart, breathe in my soul 
 Give me love to love someone 
 Show me Your way, show me Your truth 
 Holy Spirit flow through me 
 Breathe in my heart, breathe in my soul 
 Give me love to love someone 
 Show me Your way, show me Your truth 
 Holy Spirit flow through me

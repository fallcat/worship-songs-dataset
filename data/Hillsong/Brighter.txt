You shine brighter 
 Than any star in the sky 
 Your light shining 
 Through the dark of the night 
 Jesus forever 
 I find all that I am 
 In Your love, love, love 
 You are with me 
 In every step that I take 
 Your love for me 
 You have called me by name 
 Jesus forever 
 I find all that I am 
 In Your love, love, love 
 Let the music play 
 Hear us praise Your name 
 See the darkness fade 
 Dance the night away 
 We have found our place 
 In the Savior's grace 
 Dance the night away 
 Your light is taking over me 
 I find freedom 
 In the light of Your love 
 Everlasting 
 You are more than enough 
 Jesus forever 
 I find all that I am 
 In Your love, love, love 
 Let the music play 
 Hear us praise Your name 
 See the darkness fade 
 Dance the night away 
 We have found our place 
 In the Savior's grace 
 Dance the night away 
 Your light is taking o-o-over me 
 Your light is taking o-o-over me 
 I'm dancing 'cause 
 Your love has set me free 
 Your light is taking o-o-over me 
 All of my heart and soul 
 To You alone 
 You are the one I want now 
 Forever 
 All of my heart is Yours 
 Forevermore 
 You are the one I want now 
 Forever 
 All of my heart and soul 
 To You alone 
 You are the one I want now 
 Forever 
 All of my heart is Yours 
 Forevermore 
 You are the one I want 
 Let the music play 
 Hear us praise Your name 
 See the darkness fade 
 Dance the night away 
 We have found our place 
 In the Savior's grace 
 Dance the night away 
 Your light is taking o-o-over me 
 Your light is taking o-o-over me 
 I'm dancing 'cause 
 Your love has set me free 
 Your light is taking o-o-over me

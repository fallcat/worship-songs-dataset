All these pieces 
 Broken and scattered 
 In mercy gathered 
 Mended and whole 
 Empty handed 
 But not forsaken 
 I've been set free 
 I've been set free 
 Amazing grace 
 How sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost 
 But now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see 
 Oh I can see it now 
 Oh I can see the love in Your eyes 
 Laying yourself down 
 Raising up the broken to life 
 You take our failure 
 You take our weakness 
 You set Your treasure 
 In jars of clay 
 So take this heart, Lord 
 I'll be Your vessel 
 The world to see 
 Your love in me 
 Amazing grace 
 How sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost 
 But now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see 
 Oh I can see it now 
 Oh I can see the love in Your eyes 
 Laying yourself down 
 Raising up the broken to life 
 Amazing grace 
 How sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost 
 But now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see 
 (2x) 
 Oh I can see it now 
 Oh I can see the love in Your eyes 
 Laying yourself down 
 Raising up the broken to life 
 Amazing grace 
 How sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost 
 But now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see 
 (2x) 
 Oh I can see it now 
 Oh I can see the love in Your eyes 
 Laying yourself down 
 Raising up the broken to life

Oh, dear God, we ask for Your favour 
 Come and sweep through this place 
 Oh, we desire You 
 I just wanna be with You, be where You are 
 Dwell in your presence, oh God 
 Oh, I wanna walk with You 
 And I will climb this mountain 
 And I'll step of the shore 
 And I have chosen to follow 
 And be by Your side forever more 
 Tell me what You want me to do, Lord God 
 Tell me what You want for my life 
 It's Yours, oh God, it's Yours 
 Do your will, have Your way 
 Be Lord God in this place 
 Oh, I want Your will to be done 
 And I will climb this mountain 
 And I'll step of the shore 
 And I have chosen to follow 
 And be by Your side forever more 
 And I will climb this mountain 
 And I'll step of the shore 
 And I have chosen to follow 
 And be by Your side forever more 
 Tell me what You want me to do, Lord God 
 Tell me what You want for my life 
 It's Yours, oh God, it's Yours 
 Do your will, have Your way 
 Be Lord God in this place 
 Oh, I want Your will to be done 
 And I will climb this mountain 
 And I'll step of the shore 
 And I have chosen to follow 
 And be by Your side forever more 
 And I will climb this mountain 
 And I'll step of the shore 
 And I have chosen to follow 
 And be by Your side forever more

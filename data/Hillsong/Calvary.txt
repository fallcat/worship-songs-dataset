The savior alone carried the cross 
 For all of my debt, He paid the cost 
 Salvation complete 
 Now forever I'm free 
 Calvary covers it all 
 Calvary covers it all 
 My sin and shame don't count anymore 
 All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul 
 Calvary covers it all 
 No power on earth, not even the grave 
 Can separate us from mercy and grace 
 He is faithful to save 
 Oh, His blood never fails 
 Calvary covers it all 
 Calvary covers it all 
 My sin and shame don't count anymore 
 All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul 
 Calvary covers it all 
 No one but Jesus 
 Can make us pure as snow 
 We stand in Your freedom 
 Calvary covers it all 
 Calvary covers it all 
 My sin and shame don't count anymore 
 All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul 
 Calvary covers it all 
 (x2) 
 All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul 
 Calvary covers it all 
 (x2)

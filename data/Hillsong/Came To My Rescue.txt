Falling on my knees in worship 
 Giving all I am to seek Your face 
 Lord all I am is Yours 
 My whole life 
 I place in Your hands 
 God of Mercy 
 Humbled I bow down 
 In Your presence at Your throne 
 I called, You answered 
 And You came to my rescue and I 
 I wanna be where You are 
 In my life be lifted high 
 In our world be lifted high 
 In our love be lifted high

Try to find the words to express the way You are 
 But the beauty of the Lord 
 Can not be described 
 In just one lifetime 
 Look at the sun over the seas 
 Look at Your grace that covers me 
 Now I know, yes I know 
 Now I know, I know 
 Your love has saved me 
 In the morning 
 I can't stop praising Your Name 
 In the evening 
 I can't stop praising Your Name 
 In the morning 
 I can't stop praising Your Name 
 In the evening, I can't stop 
 And I want you to know 
 Yes, I want you to know, oh yes I 
 And I want you to know 
 Yes, I want you to know 
 Lord You're so amazing 
 Every word You say is true 
 Better than the finest treasure 
 So glad that I found You 
 You held me close when I was down 
 Your world has turned my world around 
 Now I know, yes I know 
 Now I know, I know 
 How much I love you 
 Hallelujah, we praise Your Name 
 We praise Your Name

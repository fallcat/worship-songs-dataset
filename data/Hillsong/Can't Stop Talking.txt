Well, I can't stop talking 'bout everything He's done 
 It's the best thing, happened since the world began 
 It didn't come cheap but I got it for free 
 It's the hope of glory, Christ in me 
 Can't stop talking 'bout everything He's done 
 It's the best thing, happened since the world began 
 It didn't come cheap but I got it for free 
 It's the hope of glory, Christ in me 
 He helped me to see when my spirit was blind 
 It's amazing if you look just what you'll find 
 Every step I took, He took two 
 If He did it for me, He can do it for you 
 He helped me to see when my spirit was blind 
 It's amazing if you look just what you'll find 
 Every step I took, He took two 
 If He did it for me, He can do it for you 
 Do you know Him? Yes, I do 
 Do you know what I say is true? 
 Do you know Him? Yes, I do 
 If He did it for me, He can do it for you 
 Do you know Him? Yes, I do 
 Do you know what I say is true? 
 Do you know Him? Yes, I do 
 If He did it for me, He can do it for you 
 Do you know Him? Yes, I do 
 Do you know what I say is true? 
 Do you know Him? Yes, I do 
 If He did it for me, He can do it for you 
 Well, I can't stop talking 'bout everything He's done 
 It's the best thing, happened since the world began 
 It didn't come cheap but I got it for free 
 It's the hope of glory, Christ in me 
 I can't stop talking 'bout it 
 It's the best thing, since the world began 
 It didn't come cheap but I got it for free 
 It's the hope of glory, Christ in me 
 Oh, thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord

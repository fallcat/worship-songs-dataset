Through waters uncharted my soul will embark 
 I'll follow Your voice straight into the dark 
 And if from the course You intend 
 I depart 
 Speak to the sails of my wandering heart 
 Like the wind 
 You'll guide 
 Clear the skies before me 
 And I'll glide this open sea 
 Like the stars 
 Your Word 
 Will align my voyage 
 And remind me where I've been 
 And where I am going 
 Lost in the shallows amidst fear and fog 
 Your truth is the compass that points me back north 
 Jesus 
 My Captain 
 My soul's trusted Lord 
 All my allegiance is rightfully Yours 
 Like the wind 
 You'll guide 
 Clear the skies before me 
 And I'll glide this open sea 
 Like the stars 
 Your Word 
 Will align my voyage 
 And remind me where I've been 
 And where I am going 
 Like the wind 
 You'll guide 
 Clear the skies before me 
 And I'll glide this open sea 
 Like the stars 
 Your Word 
 Will align my voyage 
 And remind me where I've been 
 And where I am going 
 Jesus 
 My Captain 
 My soul's trusted Lord 
 All my allegiance is rightfully Yours

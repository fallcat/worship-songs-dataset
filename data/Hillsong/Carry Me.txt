You lead me in to your courts 
 Surround me with your love 
 I walk with you, I do not fear 
 In this place 
 Dreams are made 
 In this place 
 Where you are 
 Carry me here in your arms of love 
 Draw me close to you 
 I wanna be where you are 
 You carry me, you are my strength 
 I've learned to trust in you 
 And once again I'm reaching out 
 In this place 
 Dreams are made 
 In this place 
 Where you are 
 Carry me here in your arms of love 
 Draw me close to you 
 I wanna be where you are 
 Carry me here in your arms of love 
 Draw me close to you 
 I wanna be where you are 
 Carry me here in your arms of love 
 Draw me close to you 
 I wanna be where you are 
 Carry me here in your arms of love 
 Draw me close to you 
 I wanna be where you are 
 Carry me here in your arms of love 
 Draw me close to you 
 I wanna be where you are

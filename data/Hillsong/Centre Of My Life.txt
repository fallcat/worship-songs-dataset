Let my walk speak loud 
 And my words be true 
 Let my life be whole 
 With my eyes on you 
 Lord I'm stepping out 
 From the comfort zone 
 Letting go of me, 
 Holding onto You 
 Freedom comes 
 When I call You Lord 
 You are Lord my God 
 You are the centre of it all, 
 The universe declares in awe 
 Your majesty 
 I surrender all 
 I make you 
 The centre of my life 
 Lord, I respond with all I am 
 You placed in me the song 
 Of heavens melody 
 Your Majesty 
 I live to sing Your song 
 I have found Your peace 
 It replaces any fear 
 You have done it all 
 I can trust in you 
 So I'm stepping out 
 From the comfort zone 
 Letting go of me 
 Holding onto you 
 This is your song not mine 
 It is your song that bring healing to this land 
 This is your song not mine 
 It is your song that brings feedom 
 Freedom comes, when I call you Lord 
 Freedom comes, when I call you Lord 
 You are Lord, my God 
 You are the song 
 You are the majesty 
 I live to sing your song 
 Your majesty 
 I live to sing Your song

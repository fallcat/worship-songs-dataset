Children in the wilderness 
 Following the love You poured out for us 
 Covered by the Name that we confess 
 Jesus Saviour forever 
 Roaming through the dark of night 
 Clinging to the word that burns deep inside 
 Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light 
 Jesus Saviour forever 
 Set alight to follow 
 In the shadow of Your Name 
 The world is Yours and I know 
 Everything will find its place 
 Under Your Name 
 Walking on through the fire 
 Knowing I will not be burned but refined 
 Fearless in Your Name ever by my side 
 Jesus Saviour forever 
 Taking on the raging storm 
 Anchored to the kingdom unshakable 
 Holding to Your Name that outshines all 
 Jesus Saviour forever 
 Children of the light 
 Blazing through the night 
 Taking back what the devil had stolen 
 Calling on Your Name 
 Breaking every chain 
 Jesus everlasting freedom 
 Running through the wild 
 Dancing in the fire 
 Taking back what the devil had stolen 
 All the power 
 All the glory 
 All the praise be to Your Name forever

Here I am so close to you 
 Know My voice, I'll never leave you 
 For I have loved you since before 
 The sands of time were made 
 I love you still and always will 
 You're chosen as Mine 
 My Father wants to bless you now 
 Receive from Him all that you'll ever need 
 Come spend eternity with Me 
 My heart's full of love for you 
 I love you still and always will 
 You're chosen as Mine 
 Cries in the desert, My child I hear them 
 Tears in the valley, My lovely I count them 
 You're so precious, you were on My mind as I died 
 Here I am so close to you 
 Know My voice, I'll never leave you 
 For I have loved you since before 
 The sands of time were made 
 I love you still and always will 
 You're chosen as Mine 
 Cries in the desert, My child, I hear them 
 Tears in the valley, My lovely, I count them 
 You're so precious, you were on My mind as I died 
 I love you, as I died for you, because I 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 I love you still, always will 
 You're chosen as Mine 
 I love you, I love you 
 Oh, (Incomprehensible) I do 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah

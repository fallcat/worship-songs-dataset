Christ is my reward and all of my devotion 
 Now there's nothing in this world that could ever satisfy 
 Through every trial my soul will sing 
 No turning back I've been set free 
 Christ is enough for me 
 Christ is enough for me 
 Everything I need is in You 
 Everything I need 
 Christ my all in all the joy of my salvation 
 And this hope will never fail heaven is our home 
 Through every storm my soul will sing 
 Jesus is here to God be the glory 
 I have decided to follow Jesus 
 No turning back, no turning back 
 I have decided to follow Jesus 
 No turning back, no turning back 
 The cross before me the world behind me 
 No turning back, no turning back 
 The cross before me the world behind me 
 No turning back, no turning back

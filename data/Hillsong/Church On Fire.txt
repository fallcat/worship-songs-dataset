The Holy Spirit is here and His power is real 
 Anything can happen and it probably will 
 Something very good something good is going on around here 
 There's a light that shines to make the dark disappear 
 A power at work but there's nothing to fear 
 Something very good something good is going on around here 
 This is a church on fire, this is the Holy Spirit flame 
 We have a burning desire to lift up Jesus' name 
 Let the fire burn in every heart to light the way, defeat the dark 
 Let the flame of love burn higher 
 This is a church, this is a church on fire

In the arms of the Father 
 There is love like no other 
 He who formed all things 
 Offers love to me 
 Where You go we will follow 
 Through the dark, through the narrow 
 And in all we do 
 We are bound to You 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That compares to all You are 
 We are found in Your presence 
 Seeking You in Your fullness 
 Give us eyes to see 
 You are all we need 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That compares to all You are 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That compares to all You are 
 My sole devotion 
 My only focus 
 To worship You 
 My life surrendered 
 My heart abandoned 
 For more of You 
 My sole devotion 
 My only focus 
 To worship You 
 My life surrendered 
 My heart abandoned 
 For more of You 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That compares to all You are 
 I want to be close to You 
 I want to be close to You 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That compares to all You are 
 My sole devotion 
 My only focus 
 To worship You 
 My life surrendered 
 My heart abandoned 
 For more of You 
 My sole devotion 
 My only focus 
 To worship You 
 My life surrendered 
 My heart abandoned 
 For more of You

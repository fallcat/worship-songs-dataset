I tempered the storm 
 Though your faith was small 
 I prayed while you slept 
 And the night waged war 
 We stood in the fire 
 And we walked on sea 
 And we drank of the wine 
 That was made of Me 
 Don't turn your eyes from Me 
 For My love won't be undone 
 Don't hide your face from Me 
 For My light has surely come 
 Surely come surely come 
 I carried that cross 
 And I felt your pain 
 I took up your crown 
 And I wore your shame 
 And death was a fire 
 And its teeth were grim 
 But I left it behind 
 Along with all your sin 
 Don't turn away from Me 
 For My love won't be undone 
 Don't hide your face from Me 
 For My light has surely come 
 Surely Come surely come 
 Lift up your eyes and see 
 Heaven is closer than you know 
 Lift up your voice and sing 
 Know that My love won't let you go 
 And I won't forsake you 
 Lift up your eyes and see 
 Heaven is closer than you know 
 Know I'll never leave you 
 So lift up your voice and sing 
 Know that My love won't let you go 
 And My light has surely come 
 Surely come surely come 
 And I'm closer than you know 
 And I'm closer than you know 
 Lord I hear You I know You're there 
 Closer now than my skin and bones could dare 
 Breathing deep within me 
 You are always with me 
 I can see You where eyes can't stare 
 Brighter now than the sun could ever dare 
 Breathing all around me 
 God I know You're with me here 
 Lord I hear You I know You're there 
 Closer now than my skin and bones could dare 
 Breathing deep within me 
 You are always with me 
 I can see You where eyes can't stare 
 Brighter now than the sun could ever dare 
 Breathing all around me 
 God I know that You are here 
 For I'm Yours and You are mine 
 And my soul knows well 
 You are here 
 You are here 
 And my soul will praise You 
 And my soul will praise Your Name 
 Singing Holy is Your Name 
 Jesus

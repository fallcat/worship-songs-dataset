There is no life without You 
 You have all that we need 
 Where You are ev'ry fear is broken 
 And the darkness must flee 
 Closer and closer we want to know You 
 Reaching out reaching out 
 Here in Your presence we want to go deeper 
 In Your light come alive 
 There is no one beside You 
 You alone are enough 
 You fling the doors of Your heart wide open 
 And we are lost in Your love 
 To You we will come running 
 In You we find belonging 
 Your love is all that can satisfy

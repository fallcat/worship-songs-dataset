My hope is built on nothing less 
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness 
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame 
 But wholly trust in Jesus' Name 
 Christ alone 
 Cornerstone 
 Weak made strong 
 In the Saviour's love 
 Through the storm 
 He is Lord 
 Lord of all 
 When darkness seems to hide His face 
 I rest on His unchanging grace 
 In every high and stormy gale 
 My anchor holds within the veil 
 My anchor holds within the veil 
 When He shall come with trumpet sound 
 Oh may I then in Him be found 
 Dressed in His righteousness alone 
 Faultless stand before the throne

There is a hill I cherish 
 Where stood a precious tree 
 The emblem of salvation 
 The gift of Calvary 
 How is it I should profit? 
 While He is crucified 
 Yet as His life was taken 
 So I was granted mine 
 My wealth is in the cross 
 There's nothing more I want 
 Than just to know His love 
 My heart is set on Christ 
 And I will count all else as loss 
 The greatest of my crowns 
 Mean nothing to me now 
 For I counted up the cost 
 And all my wealth is in the cross 
 I will not boast in riches 
 I have no pride in gold 
 But I will boast in Jesus 
 And in His name alone 
 My wealth is in the cross 
 There's nothing more I want 
 Than just to know His love 
 My heart is set on Christ 
 And I will count all else as loss 
 The greatest of my crowns 
 Mean nothing to me now 
 For I counted up the cost 
 And all my wealth is in the cross 
 Yes all my wealth is in the cross 
 And when I stand in glory 
 My crowns before the Lord 
 Let this be my confession 
 My wealth is in the cross 
 My wealth is in the cross 
 There's nothing more I want 
 Than just to know His love 
 My heart is set on Christ 
 And I will count all else as loss 
 The greatest of my crowns 
 Mean nothing to me now 
 For I counted up the cost 
 And all my wealth is in the cross 
 There's nothing more I want 
 Than just to know His love 
 My heart is set on Christ 
 And I will count all else as loss 
 The greatest of my crowns 
 Mean nothing to me now 
 For I counted up the cost 
 And all my wealth is in the cross 
 Yes all my wealth is in the cross 
 My wealth is in the cross 
 Yes all my wealth is in the cross

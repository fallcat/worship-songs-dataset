Light of men, love of God 
 Healing for the wounded heart 
 Like a child I quiet my soul 
 Hear Your voice surround me, Lord 
 Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart 
 And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer 
 Take me deeper, oh, Lord 
 Glorious Son, to You I shall bow 
 Bow my knee, bow my will 
 Cherished by the strong and the weak 
 Humble hearts shall hear You speak 
 Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart 
 And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer 
 Take me deeper 
 Oh, Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart 
 And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer 
 Take me deeper, oh, Lord 
 By Your love, Lord, You opened my heart 
 Now Your light will shine always 
 By Your Word, Lord, Your promise secure 
 And my soul will live always 
 By Your love, Lord, You opened my heart 
 Now Your light will shine always 
 By Your word, Lord, Your promise secure 
 And my soul will live always 
 Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart 
 And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer 
 Take me deeper 
 Jesus, hold me into Your heart, into Your heart 
 And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer 
 Take me deeper, oh, Lord, take me deeper, oh, Lord 
 Take me deeper, oh, Lord

In my life You've heard me say 
 I love you 
 How do I show you it's true 
 Hear my heart, it longs for more of you... 
 I've fallen deeply in love with you... 
 You have stolen my heart 
 I'm captivated by you 
 Never will you and I part 
 I've fallen deeply in love with you 
 You and I, together forever 
 Nothing can, stand in the way 
 My love for you, grows stronger 
 Each new day. 
 I've fallen deeply in love with you 
 You have stolen my heart 
 I'm captivated by you 
 Never will you and I part 
 I've fallen deeply in love with you 
 Jesus, you've stolen my heart 
 I'm captivated by you 
 Never will you and I part 
 I've fallen deeply in love with you

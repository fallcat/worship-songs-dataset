In Your presence I quiet my soul 
 And I hear Your voice 
 In my spirit I hear the sound 
 Of salvation's song 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 I will wait in Your word, oh Lord 
 There Your spirit speaks 
 Bringing life to the weary soul 
 To the depths of me 
 Jesus, Jesus [x2] 
 I love You with all my heart 
 I love You with all my soul, Lord 
 I love You with all my strength 
 With all that is within me 
 (x2) 
 I'll sing cause You saved my soul 
 I'll sing of Your love forever 
 I'll worship with all my heart 
 With all that is within me 
 Jesus, Jesus [x6] 
 I love You with all my heart 
 I love You with all my soul, Lord 
 I love You with all my strength 
 With all that is within me 
 I'll sing cause You saved my soul 
 I'll sing of Your love forever 
 I'll worship with all my heart 
 With all that is within me 
 Jesus, Jesus [x4]

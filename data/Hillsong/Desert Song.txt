This is my prayer in the desert 
 When all that's within me feels dry 
 This is my prayer in my hunger and need 
 My God is the God who provides 
 And this is my prayer in the fire 
 In weakness, or trial, or pain 
 There is a faith proved to more worth than gold 
 So refine me Lord through the flame 
 I will bring praise 
 I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 I will rejoice, I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 This is my prayer in the battle 
 When triumph is still on its way 
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ 
 So firm on His promise I'll stand 
 All of my life, in every season 
 You are still God 
 I have a reason to sing 
 I have a reason to worship 
 And this is my prayer in the harvest 
 When favour and providence flow 
 I know I'm filled to be emptied again 
 The seed I receive I will sow

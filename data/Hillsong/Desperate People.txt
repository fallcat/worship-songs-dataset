You crossed the great divide, You took our place 
 You offered up Your life, for we had failed 
 The veil was torn and love remained 
 You are holy, Lord 
 Distraction costs us, how we seek Your face 
 We offer up our lives to bring You praise 
 A love the walls cannot contain 
 You are holy, Lord 
 We're rising up in spirit and in truth 
 A living sacrifice, we worship You 
 People undivided, Lord, hear us sing 
 We are Yours and You are our King 
 This is our love, hearts joined as one 
 Desperate for all You are 
 Lord, break down these walls and see how we love 
 Desperate for all You are, we chase Your heart 
 We didn't come to leave here entertained 
 Or worship under any other name 
 We're crying out for You alone 
 You are holy, Lord 
 We're rising up in spirit and in truth 
 A living sacrifice, we worship You 
 People undivided, Lord, hear us sing 
 We are Yours and You are our king 
 This is our love, hearts joined as one 
 Desperate for all You are 
 Lord, break down these walls and see how we love 
 Desperate for all You are, we chase Your heart 
 Show us the way to Your heart 
 We found our voice, we found our cause 
 We're on our knees, the carpet's worn 
 As we join our hearts with distant shores 
 And sing to You, Lord 
 This is our love, hearts joined as one 
 Desperate for all You are 
 Lord, break down these walls and see how we love 
 Desperate for all You are 
 This is our love, hearts joined as one 
 Desperate for all You are 
 Oh Lord, break down these walls and see how we love 
 Desperate for all You are, we chase your heart

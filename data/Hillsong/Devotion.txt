I've been running, trying to be one who sees 
 I've been working, salvation out on my knees 
 There is nothing better than knowing 
 That we are redeemed 
 Unbelieving trusting in creative hands, 
 I am praying for our world to bow to your plan 
 And this one thought is unmistakable 
 I take up my cross and follow you Lord 
 When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow 
 When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still 
 And I see the sinner seek devotion 
 The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees 
 Unforgiven, my savior who did not deserve death 
 He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness 
 Undelivered, but it doesn't seem right 
 Unless I keep my eyes focused on the savior who gave his live 
 In the middle of a world that denies it believes 
 It is breaking apart at the very seams 
 There is one thing to be alive for 
 And it's to take up my cross and follow you Lord 
 I will take up my cross and follow Lord where you lead me 
 And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go

Did you feel the mountains tremble? 
 Did you hear the oceans roar? 
 When the people rose to sing of 
 Jesus Christ, the risen One 
 Did you feel the people tremble? 
 Did you hear the singers roar? 
 When the lost began to sing of 
 Jesus Christ, the Saving One 
 And we can see that 
 God You're moving 
 A mighty river through the nations 
 And young and old will turn to Jesus 
 Fling wide you heavenly gates 
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord 
 Open up the doors 
 Let the music play 
 Let the streets resound with singing 
 Songs that bring Your hope 
 Songs that bring Your joy 
 Dancers who dance 
 Upon injustice 
 Do you feel the darkness tremble? 
 When all the saints join in one song 
 And all the streams flow as one river 
 To wash away our brokenness

Did you know there's someone loving You? 
 He lives in me and other people too 
 Did you know He died on a cross? 
 And did you know His name is Jesus? 
 I want to thank You 
 For everything You've done 
 You love me and gave Your only Son 
 To die on a cross for my sin 
 To die on a cross for my sin 
 Did you know He rose from the dead? 
 He's risen up and He'll be back again 
 Did you know He's loving you today? 
 And did you know He's the only way? 
 I want to thank You 
 For everything You've done 
 You love me and gave Your only Son 
 To die on a cross for my sin 
 To die on a cross for my sin 
 I want to thank You 
 For everything You've done 
 You love me and gave Your only Son 
 I want to thank You 
 For everything You've done 
 You love me and gave Your only Son 
 To die on a cross for my sin 
 To die on a cross for my sin 
 To die on a cross for my sin

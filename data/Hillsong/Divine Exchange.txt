Song name: Divine Exchange 
 Artist: Abundant Life Ministries 
 My heart is captivated Lord, by You alone 
 Captured by the awesomeness of You alone 
 Melted by the grace and mercy You have shown 
 I stand in wonder 
 I reach to you the one who make the blind eyes see 
 Who breaks the chains of sickness with authority 
 Restoring of what was broken 
 So it may fly again 
 I live to worship you 
 I breathe to worship to you 
 All of my days, your face I'll seek 
 For as I worship you 
 You lead me to that place 
 To that place of divine exchange

I cry from my heart 
 I want to please You Lord 
 To serve You each day 
 Love You and learn all Your ways 
 You said if I love You 
 Then I will keep Your commands 
 You did the Father's will 
 Oh Your love is so real 
 To love You Lord is to obey 
 And my Jesus I'll do what You say 
 Jesus I'll do what You say 
 Jesus I'll do what You say 
 Your Word is my light 
 Pure and alive in my heart 
 And I know I am 
 Your hands and Your feet to the world 
 I pray help me to love 
 My brother as myself 
 You showed the greatest love 
 Is the life for Your friend 
 I love You Lord I live to please You 
 And my Jesus I'll do what You say 
 Jesus I'll do what You say 
 Jesus I'll do what You say 
 You tell me to go and I will go 
 You tell me to stay and I will stay 
 To hear You say My servant well done 
 My servant well done 
 And my Jesus I'll do what You say 
 Jesus I'll do what You say 
 Jesus I'll do what You say

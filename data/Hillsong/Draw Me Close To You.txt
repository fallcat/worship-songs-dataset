Draw me close to You 
 Never let me go 
 I lay it all down again 
 To hear You say that I'm Your friend 
 You are my desire 
 No one else will do 
 'Cause nothing else could take Your place 
 To feel the warmth of Your embrace 
 Help me find the way 
 Bring me back to You 
 You're all I want 
 You're all I've ever needed 
 You're all I want 
 Help me know You are near

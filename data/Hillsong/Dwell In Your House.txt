You set me apart 
 Gave me a new heart 
 Filled with compassion 
 To share Your great love 
 Show me Your ways 
 I want to know You 
 Guide me in truth 
 My hope is in You 
 That I may dwell in Your house forever 
 Lifting up Your name 
 Dwell in Your house forever more 
 That I may dwell in Your house forever 
 Lifting up Your name 
 Dwell in Your house forever more 
 I'll hold on to You, 
 My strength and my refuge. 
 Whom shall I fear? 
 I know You are near 
 All of my days 
 I live for You, Lord 
 Establish my path 
 There's one thing I ask 
 That I may dwell in Your house forever 
 Lifting up Your name 
 Dwell in Your house forever more 
 That I may dwell in Your house forever 
 Lifting up Your name 
 Dwell in Your house forever more 
 Holy Spirit, have Your way 
 Sweet anointing teach our hearts 
 Our lives, we pray 
 That I may dwell in Your house forever 
 Lifting up Your name 
 Dwell in Your house forever more 
 That I may dwell in Your house forever 
 Lifting up Your name 
 Dwell in Your house forever more 
 That I may dwell in Your house forever 
 Lifting up Your name 
 Dwell in Your house forever more

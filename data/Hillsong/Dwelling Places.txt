Lovely are Your dwelling places 
 Thirsty, I come after You 
 Jesus, my joy, my reward 
 Your love's restoring my soul 
 Now I'm Yours and You are mine 
 And from my heart a song will rise 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 And my heart will follow wholly after You, Jesus 
 Jesus, there is none beside You 
 Righteous, ruler of the earth 
 Nations will come and bow down 
 Name over all names I sing You praises 
 And all that I can say to You is 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 And my heart will follow wholly after You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 And my heart will follow wholly after You 
 And my heart will follow wholly after You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 I love You, I love You, I love You 
 And my heart will follow wholly after You 
 (I will follow) 
 And my heart will follow wholly after You 
 And my heart will follow wholly after You

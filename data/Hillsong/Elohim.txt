I stand upon the solid rock of faith in Christ 
 This steadfast hope shall not break apart within the trial 
 I am assured His promises will never fail 
 As long as life remains, He is faithful 
 God is patient 
 God is kind 
 He does not envy 
 He does not boast 
 His ways are higher than my own 
 His thoughts consume the great unknown 
 Of this alone I am sure 
 My God is love 
 I draw my breath under His created windswept sky 
 I know my hope shall last, long after my flesh retires 
 From dusk until the dawn, He calls His children home 
 His righteous love outlasts generations 
 God is patient 
 God is kind 
 He does not envy 
 He does not boast 
 His ways are higher than my own 
 His thoughts consume the great unknown 
 Of this alone I am sure 
 My God is love 
 He's Almighty God, Elohim 
 Maker of the earth 
 He is the Lord of Hosts, Heaven's King 
 God of endless worth 
 His kingdom stands above every power 
 Every living soul 
 His love is like the sun, ever true 
 Shining over all 
 He's Almighty God, Elohim 
 Maker of the earth 
 He is the Lord of Hosts, Heaven's King 
 God of endless worth 
 His kingdom stands above every power 
 Every living soul 
 His love is like the sun, ever true 
 Shining over all 
 God is patient 
 God is kind 
 He does not envy 
 He does not boast 
 His ways are higher than my own 
 His thoughts consume the great unknown 
 Of this alone I am sure 
 My God is love

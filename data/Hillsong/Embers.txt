A spark in the night, a flame of hope 
 Spirit of God within my soul 
 Alive within my heart 
 The life in my bones 
 You lifted my eyes towards You Lord 
 Teaching my heart to draw in close 
 To the all consuming God 
 Our great unending hope 
 As ember fans into flame 
 I'm revived within Your Name 
 Your Spirit lives within me 
 Your Spirit lives within me 
 This fire burns in my soul 
 Let the light of heaven glow 
 For all the earth to see You 
 All the earth to see You 
 Spirit leading me each day 
 Casting a light to lead the way 
 My God stay the path 
 You call me onwards 
 Here in all holiness on earth 
 Blazing forever glorious 
 You're the all consuming God 
 Our great unending hope 
 As ember fans into flame 
 I'm revived within Your Name 
 Your Spirit lives within me 
 Your Spirit lives within me 
 This fire burns in my soul 
 Let the light of heaven glow 
 For all the earth to see You 
 All the earth to see You 
 For all of this life 
 Your Spirit ignites 
 A heavenly fire 
 Untouched by the night 
 You open our eyes 
 Turn death into life 
 Revealing all truth 
 There's no one like You 
 For all of this life 
 Your Spirit ignites 
 A heavenly fire 
 Untouched by the night 
 You open our eyes 
 Turn death into life 
 Revealing all truth 
 There's no one like You 
 As ember fans into flame 
 I'm revived within Your Name 
 Your Spirit lives within me 
 Your Spirit lives within me 
 This fire burns in my soul 
 Let the light of heaven glow 
 For all the earth to see You 
 All the earth to see You 
 For all of this life 
 Your Spirit ignites 
 A heavenly fire 
 Untouched by the night 
 You open our eyes 
 Turn death into life 
 Revealing all truth 
 There's no one like You

Holy Holy I will bow before 
 My Lord and King 
 Hallelujah You have come to us 
 You make all things new 
 Emmanuel, Jesus Christ 
 You'll never let me go 
 My shepherd King 
 You're watching over me 
 Emmanuel 
 So amazing, You have named the stars 
 Of the deepest night 
 Still You love me 
 You have called my name 
 I will follow You 
 Holy Holy God Almighty 
 There is none like You 
 Holy Holy God Almighty 
 There is none like You 
 Emmanuel Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel

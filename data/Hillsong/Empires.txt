We are worlds, we are bodies 
 Empires of dirt and grace 
 Silhouettes and reflections 
 Caught in His holy flame 
 Beneath our skin 
 A new creation 
 The night is done 
 Our chains are broken 
 The time has come 
 The wait is over 
 The King is here 
 And His Name is Jesus 
 This is love 
 Bending skies to heal the broken 
 This is love 
 Bleeding life into the grave 
 Hear the sound 
 As our hearts cry out forever 
 Singing hallelujah 
 Breathing in a brand new world 
 We are shadows and portraits 
 Empires of light and clay 
 Images of our Maker 
 Sinners called out as saints 
 Beneath our skin 
 A new creation 
 The night is done 
 Our chains are broken 
 The time has come 
 The wait is over 
 The King is here 
 And His Name is Jesus 
 This is love 
 Bending skies to heal the broken 
 This is love 
 Bleeding life into the grave 
 Hear the sound 
 As our hearts cry out forever 
 Singing hallelujah 
 Breathing in a brand new world 
 No eye has seen 
 No ear has heard 
 No mind conceive 
 What heaven holds 
 But here and now 
 Let earth be found 
 With all our crowns 
 Upon Your Name 
 No eye has seen 
 No ear has heard 
 No mind conceive 
 What heaven holds 
 But here and now 
 Let earth be found 
 With all our crowns 
 Upon Your Name

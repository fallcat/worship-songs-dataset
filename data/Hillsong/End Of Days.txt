You came to earth that You created 
 You walked beneath the stars You named 
 You came from heaven holding freedom 
 Jesus Christ the Lord our God

 You dwelt in time that You designed 
 Creator lived in His creation 
 Completely man, completely God 
 I'm gonna sing until my voice won't let me 
 As thunders roar I'll shout Your praise 
 You're the God of everlasting wonder 
 Your love outlasts the end of days 
 I'll lift Your Name higher and higher

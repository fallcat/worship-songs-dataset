From the highest throne 
 To the earth below 
 You laid down Your life 
 For the likes of us 
 Great is the love of the Saviour 
 From a wounded heart 
 To a life made whole 
 Every human heart 
 Will declare as one 
 Great is the love of the Saviour 
 Lord of endless light 
 Let Your glory shine forever 
 All the earth 
 All the earth 
 Sing Your praise 
 Hope of every heart 
 Let Your Name be lifted higher 
 All our hearts 
 All our hearts 
 Sing Your praise 
 From the mountain heights 
 To the valleys low 
 All created things 
 Given life to show 
 Jesus we live for Your glory 
 From the rising sun 
 To the still of night 
 Every waking moment 
 For Your delight 
 Jesus we live for Your glory 
 God be exalted 
 God be exalted 
 In everything 
 We live for Your glory 
 Live for Your glory

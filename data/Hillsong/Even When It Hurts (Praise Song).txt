Take this fainted heart 
 Take these tainted hands 
 Wash me in Your love 
 Come like grace again 
 Even when my strength is lost 
 I'll praise You 
 Even when I have no song 
 I'll praise You 
 Even when it's hard to find the words 
 Louder then I'll sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 Take this mountain weight 
 Take these ocean tears 
 Hold me through the trial 
 Come like hope again 
 Even when the fight seems lost 
 I'll praise You 
 Even when it hurts like hell 
 I'll praise You 
 Even when it makes no sense to sing 
 Louder then I'll sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 And my heart burns only for You 
 You are all You are all I want 
 And my soul waits only for You 
 And I will sing till the morning has come 
 Lord my heart burns only for You 
 You are all You are all I want 
 And my soul waits only for You 
 And I will sing till the miracle comes 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise 
 Even when the morning comes 
 I'll praise You 
 Even when the fight is won 
 I'll praise You 
 Even when my time on earth is done 
 Louder then I'll sing your praise 
 I will only sing Your praise

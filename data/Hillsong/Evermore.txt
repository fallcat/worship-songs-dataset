Lost for words with all to say 
 Lord You take my breath away 
 Still my soul, my soul cries out 
 For You are holy 
 And as I look upon Your name 
 Circumstances fade away 
 Now Your glory steals my heart 
 You are holy 
 You are holy Lord 
 Evermore my heart, my heart will say 
 Above all, I live for Your glory 
 Even if my world falls I will say 
 Above all, I live for Your glory 
 With all my heart I'll say 
 I'm living for Your name 
 With all to give You praise 
 We're living for Your glory Lord

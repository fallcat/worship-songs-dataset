(3X) 
 Every move I make 
 I make in You 
 You make me move, Jesus 
 Every breath I take 
 I breathe in You 
 Every step I take 
 I take in You 
 You are my way, Jesus 
 Every breath I take 
 I breathe in You 
 Waves of mercy 
 Waves of grace 
 Everywhere I look 
 I see Your face 
 Your love has captured me 
 Oh my God, this love 
 How can it be

Jesus, I love You, my Saviour 
 Jesus, Your love it has healed me opened my heart 
 Jesus, I thank You for all that You've given 
 Jesus, I stand here amazed at forgiveness 
 Every time I close my eyes, 
 I'm filled with awe at all you've done 
 Every time I think on You, 
 I'm grateful for Your Love 
 Oh Lord, here I am, raise my hands 
 I surrender 
 Oh Lord, here I am at your Throne, 
 Sweet abandon

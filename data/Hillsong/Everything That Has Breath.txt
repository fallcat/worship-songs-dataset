Praise Him in the sanctuary 
 Praise Him in the mighty heavens 
 Praise Him 
 All the earth praise Him 
 Praise Him in His awesome power 
 Praise His great and holy Name 
 Praise Him 
 The whole world praise Him 
 From the rising of the sun 
 Let His praise be heard 
 From the east to the west 
 And the north to south 
 Let everything that has breath 
 Praise the Lord forever 
 Let everything in my soul 
 Praise the Lord

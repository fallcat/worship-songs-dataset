Jesus Christ, King of glory 
 Lord of all, we praise You 
 Forever Your name will be praised 
 In heaven and earth always 
 Jesus Christ, You're my Saviour 
 And I will run after You 
 For You are the Son of God 
 And King over all the world 
 And I will never stop praising You 
 For all the things You've done for me 
 And I'll be Yours forever 
 Jesus, You're everything to me 
 Jesus, You're everything to me

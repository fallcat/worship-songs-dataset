I have found exceeding joy 
 Jesus answered when I called 
 This Name that has saved me 
 Pure love that embraced me 
 Mercy, grace, eternal life 
 Bought from darkness to His light 
 While lost in my sin, He 
 Raised me and made me live 
 My soul magnifies the Lord 
 My heart joys in God my Saviour 
 For He lifts the lowly 
 He's done great things for me 
 I will sing, praising evermore 
 He is mighty and Holy is His Name. 
 I will lift my head up high 
 Praising Jesus through each trial 
 Though I have not seen Him 
 I love Him completely

I remember when I called Your name 
 There I knew I'd never be the same 
 Love came rushing to this heart of mine 
 Like You waited for this all my life 
 I remember when I learned to pray 
 Close to You I find my hiding place 
 And Your Spirit looks within my soul 
 And Your presence keeps me wanting more 
 When I think upon your wounded hands 
 And how you begun a great romance 
 I will take your bread and take your wine 
 To remember what you sacrificed 
 Now I'm serving for Your kingdom come 
 Where You're leading me is where I'll run 
 Jesus I can be your hands and feet 
 And let my life remember You my King 
 I need You more than anything 
 Lord here I am 
 I'm reaching out 
 I will lay me down and surrender 
 I'll sing Your name 
 I'll sing it loud 
 You are all I want, now forever 
 Lord here I am 
 I'm reaching out 
 I will lay me down and surrender 
 I'll sing Your name 
 I'll sing it loud 
 You are all I want, now forever 
 Lord here I am 
 And the day shall come when I will rise 
 Finally I'll see you face to face 
 With the heavens I will glorify 
 Crown You Lord for eternity

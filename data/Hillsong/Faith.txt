I'm reaching for the prize, I'm giving everything 
 I give my life for this it's what I live for 
 Nothing will keep me from, all that You have for me 
 You hold my head up high, I live for You 
 Greater is He, that's living in me 
 Than he that is in the world 
 Faith, I can move the mountain 
 I can do all things through Christ, I know 
 Faith, standing and believing 
 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me

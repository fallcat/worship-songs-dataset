I'm saved from the grace that I've found in You 
 All that You've done 
 Through the Power of the Cross for me 
 I'm saved of the mercy I've found in You 
 All that You?re, the fullness of Your love for me 
 All that I have 
 Has come from Your hand 
 All I ever know is 
 Jesus, You are faithful to the end 
 I'll tell of the wonders I've found in You 
 And the love that You shown 
 Is higher than the heaven above me 
 All that I have 
 Has come from Your hand 
 All I ever know is 
 Jesus, You are faithful to the end 
 More than this world 
 Could take me from Your love 
 All I ever know is 
 Jesus, You are faithful 
 All I ever know is 
 Jesus, You are faithful to the end

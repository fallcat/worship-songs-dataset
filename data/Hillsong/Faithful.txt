"You know my future like you knew my past 
 And Your word concerning me was made to last 
 Forever 
 And I know Your word is Your integrity 
 And that You'd do just what You said You would 
 You are faithful 
 Heaven and earth will pass away 
 But Your word will remain 
 Your word will remain faithful 
 Now all I have be stripped away 
 But to You I remain 
 To You I remain faithful 
 I know that Your love is forever strong 
 And I will sing about it all day long 
 Forever 
 I know that there is no one else like You 
 And no one else can do the things You would 
 You are faithful

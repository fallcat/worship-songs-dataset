From rising sun till Kingdom come 
 Your faithful love is unfailing 
 Though shadows turn and tempests stir 
 Still You oh God are unchanging 
 Through every hour 
 I will recall 
 All my hope is Jesus 
 Great is Your faithfulness 
 Great is Your faithfulness 
 I lift my eyes I won't forget 
 How great Your faithfulness 
 When battle's near I will not fear 
 Your promises are unshaken 
 My faith is sure of nothing more 
 Than Christ alone my portion 
 There'll be a season 
 For joy and weeping 
 In everything our God is faithful 
 His arms are open 
 I will come running 
 Now and always our God is faithful

I love to worship You, my God 
 I love to worship You, my Lord 
 And see Your Spirit fall in power 
 Your love unfolding 
 Gifts from heaven 
 I love to worship You, my God 
 I love to worship You, my Lord 
 And feel Your precious 
 Breath of heaven 
 Your all consuming love 
 Holy Spirit come in power 
 Change my heart 
 I want to live for You, my God 
 Let Your Spirit come in power 
 Change my life 
 That I may live for You my Lord 
 Fall on us Lord 
 So I yearn for You 
 Long to see You move 
 Lord, I lift my hands before my King and pray

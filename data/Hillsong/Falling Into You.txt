I've lived my life to the limit 
 Well I'm at the end of myself 
 I see the end that I know below me 
 Your love is waiting to catch 
 I'm falling into you 
 Cause no one's gonna 
 Love me like you do (alright) 
 I've got nothing to lose 
 So I can't stop, won't stop 
 Falling into you (alright) 
 The rush I've felt in the free-fall 
 As I lost control of my life 
 Jesus, I've found that 
 You've always had me 
 Your love is never in doubt 
 I wanna love you like you love me 
 I wanna love you like you love me 
 I'm falling into you 
 Cause no one's gonna 
 Love me like you do (alright) 
 I've got nothing to lose 
 So I can't stop, won't stop 
 Falling into you (alright) 
 I wanna love you like you love me 
 I wanna love you like you love me 
 I'm falling into you 
 Cause no one's gonna 
 Love me like you do (alright) 
 I've got nothing to lose 
 So I can't stop, won't stop 
 Falling into you (alright) 
 I'm falling into you 
 Cause no one's gonna 
 Love me like you do (alright) 
 I've got nothing to lose 
 So I can't stop, won't stop 
 Falling into you (alright) 
 I'm falling into you

We come into Your presence 
 To sing a song to You 
 A song of praise and honor 
 For all the things You helped us through 
 You gave a life worth living 
 A life in love with You 
 And now I just love giving 
 All my praises back to You 
 You're the Father of creation 
 The risen Lamb of God 
 You're the One who walked away 
 From the empty tomb that day 
 And You set Your people free 
 With love and liberty 
 And I can walk with You 
 Every night and every day 
 You're the Father of creation 
 The risen Lamb of God 
 You're the One who walked away 
 From the empty tomb that day 
 And You set Your people free 
 With love and liberty 
 And I can walk with You 
 Every night and every day 
 We come into Your presence 
 To sing a song to You 
 A song of praise and honor 
 For all the things You helped us through 
 You gave a life worth living 
 A life in love with You 
 And now I just love giving 
 All my praises back to You 
 You're the Father of creation 
 The risen Lamb of God 
 You're the One who walked away 
 From the empty tomb that day 
 And You set Your people free 
 With love and liberty 
 And I can walk with You 
 Every night and every day 
 You're the Father of creation 
 The risen Lamb of God 
 You're the One who walked away 
 From the empty tomb that day 
 And You set Your people free 
 With love and liberty 
 And I can walk with You 
 Every night and every day 
 You're the Father of creation 
 The risen Lamb of God 
 You're the One who walked away 
 From the empty tomb that day 
 And You set Your people free 
 With love and liberty 
 And I can walk with You 
 Every night and every day

To bring this world to life 
 To heal this heart of mine 
 Your grace enough, your grace enough 
 To mend this world in need 
 To break the chains in me 
 Your grace enough, now this means love 
 The weight of all our sin upon His shoulders 
 We should all be called Your sons and daughters 
 Father, let heaven and earth collide 
 In the endless wonder of Your love upon the cross 
 We will follow and offer this life forever 
 To see Your love unfold 
 Adopted as Your own 
 Alive to make You known 
 Now this means love, this means love 
 The weight of all our sin upon His shoulders 
 We should all be called Your sons and daughters 
 Father, let heaven and earth collide 
 In the endless wonder of Your love upon the cross 
 We will follow and offer this life forever 
 To see Your love unfold 
 For the lost and for the broken 
 For the slave and for the orphan 
 For everyone to realize Your love 
 From the famous to the faceless 
 From the beggar to the king 
 For everyone to realize Your love 
 You restore the broken hearted 
 You bring freedom to the captive 
 For one and all, forever this means love 
 All Your children come together 
 All Your sons and all Your daughters 
 Your grace enough, forever this means love 
 Singing, Father, let heaven and earth collide 
 In the endless wonder of Your love upon the cross 
 We will follow and offer this life forever 
 To see Your love unfold 
 Your grace enough, forever this means love 
 You gave it all for one and all 
 Your grace enough, forever this means love

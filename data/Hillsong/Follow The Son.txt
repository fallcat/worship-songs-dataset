You are the light 
 That guides my way through fear 
 I know my path will lead me to the King 
 And all the world will bow to worship You 
 You are the God 
 Who changed the world through one Holy Son 
 You gave everything 
 So all the world will bow in awe of You 
 You came down through grace 
 To show a better way 
 I follow the Son 
 He's the only One 
 Let His Kingdom come 
 I'm giving it all to the One I love 
 I follow the Son 
 Jesus Holy One 
 Let Your will be done 
 I give it all to You 
 You are everything to me 
 You are everything to me 
 You are everything to me 
 You are everything to me

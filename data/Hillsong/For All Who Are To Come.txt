Since we are surrounded 
 By such a great cloud of witnesses 
 Let us run 
 Let us run with perseverance 
 The race marked out 
 Let us make a way 
 For those who are to come 
 Those who are to come 
 Every generation 
 Every nation 
 Every tribe 
 Every tongue 
 They will sing 
 They will pray 
 That the world would sing... 
 Hosanna...

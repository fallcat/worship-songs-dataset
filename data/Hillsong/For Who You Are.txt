Standing here in Your presence 
 Thinking of the good things You have done 
 Waiting here patiently 
 Just to hear Your still small voice again 
 Holy, righteous, faithful to the end, 
 Saviour, healer, redeemer and friend 
 I will worship You for who You are 
 I will worship You for who You are 
 I will worship You for who You are

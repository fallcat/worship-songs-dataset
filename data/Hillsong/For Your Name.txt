We've got a new life 
 In the light of your love 
 Called by name 
 To the saviour of all 
 We've got a new song 
 Generations will sing 
 We've got a new hope 
 All because of the cross 
 Saved by the grace 
 You have given to us 
 We've got a new song 
 All the nations will sing 
 For your name 
 Shines in all the earth 
 Great above our lives 
 Light of our salvation 
 For your glory 
 We will give all we are 
 All our lives 
 For the love of your son 
 We've got a new song 
 Now that we are redeemed 
 Nations rise 
 Sing of all you are 
 Holy is your name 
 Lifted high forever 
 Our hope is in 
 The saviour's love 
 You gave it all 
 Let all earth sing 
 To Christ our King 
 Be lifted up

Gloriously 
 You saved me, You saved me 
 So miraculously 
 You made me brand new 
 You welcomed me 
 With open arms, open arms 
 Unfailingly 
 Your love is a river, so 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You 
 I'll praise Your name forever and a day 
 And I'll live for You into eternity 
 I'll praise Your name forever and a day 
 And I'll live what I sing, what I say 
 What I'm learning every day 
 Generously 
 You gave me, You gave me 
 Marvelously 
 You made me, You made me 
 Relentlessly 
 I'll follow, I'll follow 
 Your majesty 
 Breathtaking, so beautiful

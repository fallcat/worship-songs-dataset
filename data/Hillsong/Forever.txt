I'll Worship at Your Throne 
 Whisper my own love song 
 With all my heart I'll sing 
 For You my Dad and King 
 I'll live for all my days 
 To Put a smile on Your face 
 And when we finally meet 
 It'll be for eternity 
 And Oh how wide You open up Your arms 
 When I need Your love 
 And how far You would come 
 If ever I was lost 
 And You said that all You feel for me 
 Is undying love 
 That You showed me through the cross 
 I'll worship You my God 
 I'll worship You my God 
 I love You 
 I love You 
 Forever I will sing 
 Forever I will be with You 
 Be with You

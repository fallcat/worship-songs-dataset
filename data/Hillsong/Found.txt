Amazing love, 
 Now what else shall I need 
 Your name brings life, 
 It's more than the air I breathe 
 My world has changed, 
 When Your life You gave for me 
 My purpose found 
 And all that You want for me 
 And I've found myself in You, Lord 
 And I've found myself in You 
 And I've found myself in You, Jesus 
 And I've found myself in You, Lord 
 So take me to a place 
 Where I can see You face to face 
 And all I wanna do, all I wanna do 
 Is worship You 
 So take me to a place 
 Where I can see You face to face 
 And all I wanna do, all I wanna do 
 Is worship You

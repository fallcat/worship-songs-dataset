This song in my heart 
 This song in my soul 
 This song I was born to sing 
 It's Your song of freedom 
 Now I'm free to dance again 
 I'll sing in the darkness 
 I'll laugh in the rain 
 Rejoice in Your love again 
 It's Your song of freedom 
 Now I'm free to dance again 
 Your spirit brings me liberty 
 Your breath of life has set me free 
 This song in my heart 
 This song in my soul 
 This song I was born to sing 
 It's Your song of freedom 
 Now I'm free to dance again 
 I'll sing in the darkness 
 I'll laugh in the rain 
 Rejoice in Your love again 
 It's Your song of freedom 
 Now I'm free to dance again 
 Your spirit brings me liberty 
 Your breath of life has set me free 
 Jesus Your love, it lifts me high 
 Gives me reason to run this race with joy 
 This song within me 
 Lord will bless Your Holy name 
 Jesus, I'll dance before Your throne 
 Bring this heavenly sound to You alone 
 This song within me 
 Lord will bless Your Holy name 
 This song in my heart 
 This song in my soul 
 This song I was born to sing 
 It's Your song of freedom 
 Now I'm free to dance again 
 I'll sing in the darkness 
 I'll laugh in the rain 
 Rejoice in Your love again 
 It's Your song of freedom 
 Now I'm free to dance again 
 Your spirit brings me liberty 
 Your breath of life has set me free 
 Jesus Your love, it lifts me high 
 Gives me reason to run this race with joy

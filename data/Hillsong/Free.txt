Would you believe me if I said... 
 That we are the ones who can make the change 
 In the world today... 
 Would you believe me if I said 
 That all of the dreams in your heart 
 Can come true... today... 
 Would you believe me if I said... 
 That life could be all that you want it to be ...today... 
 And if I had wings I would fly 
 'Cause all that I need You are 
 And if the world caved in around me 
 To You I'd still hold on 
 'Cause Your all that I believe 
 And the one that created me 
 Jesus... because of You I'm Free 
 Would you believe me if I said... 
 That God can make miracles happen today... 
 Would you believe me if I said... 
 That you don't need to wait for the answer before... 
 You step out in faith 
 Would you believe me if I said... 
 That nothin' is ever impossible... for God 
 Just live you life with God inside... 
 You won'r regret one moment of it 
 And give all that you can for God. for God

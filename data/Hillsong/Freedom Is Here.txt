Hey, the future comes alive, You speak Your word and I 
 I'm running into Your hope 
 'Cause I've seen Your light, You bring my world to life 
 I'm coming after Your love 
 I'm not shaken 
 I'm not letting go 
 Everything comes alive in my life as we lift You higher 
 Let Your freedom arise in our lives as we lift You up 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Freedom is here 
 So take the limits off no matter what the cost 
 I'm running after Your call 
 And I will run this race and see You face to face 
 So let Your power overflow 
 I'm not shaken 
 I'm not letting go 
 Everything comes alive in my life as we lift You higher 
 Let Your freedom arise in our lives as we lift You up 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Freedom is here, freedom is here 
 I will not fear, I will not hide Your love, Your love 
 All of my life I cannot deny Your love, Your love 
 Everything comes alive in my life as we lift You higher 
 Let Your freedom arise in our lives as we lift You up 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Everything comes alive in my life as we lift You higher 
 Let Your freedom arise in our lives as we lift You up 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Freedom is here 
 Freedom is here, freedom is here 
 Freedom is here, freedom is here 
 Freedom is here, freedom is here 
 Freedom is here, freedom is here 
 Freedom is here

Come on, we've got friends in high places 
 I was in need and I needed a friend 
 I was alone and I needed a hand 
 I was going down but someone rescued me 
 My God cares too much to say 
 His mercies are new everyday 
 I get down to pray and then help is on its way 
 I walk by faith and not by sight 
 If things go wrong, it'll be alright 
 'Cause someone greater is watching over me 
 My God cares too much to say 
 His mercies are new everyday 
 I get down to pray and then help is on its way 
 Now in faith, I believe 
 I got everything I need 
 I walk by faith and not by what I see 
 I got friends in high places 
 I've got someone I can call 
 And I got someone watching over me 
 I walk by faith and not by sight 
 If things go wrong, it'll be alright 
 Someone greater is watching over me 
 My God cares too much to say 
 His mercies are new everyday 
 I get down to pray and then help is on its way 
 My God cares too much to say 
 His mercies are new everyday 
 I get down to pray and then help is on its way

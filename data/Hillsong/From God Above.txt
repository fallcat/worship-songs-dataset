As I look at the world 
 I begin to dream of the future 
 What's next to be 
 Your love so strong for everyone 
 You made us all in Your image 
 And You saved the day 
 When Jesus came 
 And You took away all my sin and shame 
 And You made us right again 
 You came from God above 
 The Father's only Son 
 Saved my soul 
 Made me new 
 Now I live for You 
 My heart is alive and my spirit free 
 In the Saviour 
 Gave His life for me 
 By Your Word 
 We will be the light of the world 
 My Father 
 Shine Your light in me 
 And You saved the day 
 When Jesus came 
 And You took away all my sin and shame 
 And You made us right again 
 You came from God above 
 The Father's only Son 
 Saved my soul 
 Made me new 
 Now I live for You 
 Repeat 2x 
 I'll stand on the Word 
 Be a light in the world 
 When Your praises are heard 
 We'll be singing 
 Repeat 2x 
 We'll sing it 
 Repeat 3x 
 You came from God above 
 The Father's only Son 
 Saved my soul 
 Made me new 
 Now I live for You 
 Repeat 2x 
 I live for you

Don't close your eyes because the night is dark 
 Don't fear the future should it black the sun 
 There's a hope burning brighter in a fearless love 
 There's a brighter day 
 There's a higher name 
 Don't hide in silence while the truth screams out 
 Don't fear the future shaking up this ground 
 There's a freedom that marches in a different sound 
 So if you have the choice 
 If you have the voice 
 Then lift your voice and sing 
 If you have the breath, lift up your voice and sing 
 If you have the heart, lift up your voice and sing 
 If you have the faith, lift up your voice and sing 
 If you have the love, now's the time to use it 
 Look back no further than the Saviour's cross 
 Look to the future like the grave is lost 
 There's a promise returning all the stolen years 
 There's nothing left to fear 
 Now the King is here 
 So lift your voice and sing 
 If you have the breath, lift up your voice and sing 
 If you have the heart, lift up your voice and sing 
 If you have the faith, lift up your voice and sing 
 If you have the love, now's the time to use it 
 Salvation runs for everyone 
 So open up the doors and let us sing 
 I hear the sound march in like thunder 
 I see the Spirit bursting out in a mighty flood 
 Over everyone 
 I hear the sound of sons and daughters 
 I see the old dream wild in young imagining 
 Young and old will dream 
 I hear the sound of earth's surrender 
 Wonders above and signs below for all to see 
 We have been set free so open up the doors and sing 
 If you've been set free, lift your voice and sing 
 If you have the love, now's the time to use it 
 Salvation runs for everyone 
 So open up the doors and let us sing 
 Open up the doors and let us sing 
 We've been redeemed, we've been set free 
 The time has come, the fight is won 
 The future marches in and calls us free 
 Open up the doors and let us sing 
 We've been redeemed, we've been set free 
 The time has come, the fight is won 
 The future marches in and calls us free 
 Lift up your voice and sing 
 Salvation runs for everyone 
 So open up the doors and let us sing 
 The time has come, the fight is won 
 The future marches in and calls us free

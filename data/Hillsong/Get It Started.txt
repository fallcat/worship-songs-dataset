A brand new day has come around 
 No time to waste, get started 
 Spread the word to all the all the earth 
 In my heart and in my soul 
 A fire's burning for You 
 I can't contain it anymore 
 Here we go 
 Get it started 
 Here we go 
 I shout it out so the world can see 
 You're the Son of God 
 And alive in me 
 Jesus, You're the only way 
 You're alive, You're alive today!

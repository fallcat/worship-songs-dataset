C'mon everybody are you ready to sing? 
 Jesus is the way, He's my everything 
 Every single moment of every single day 
 There's something deep within me I just gotta say 
 I'm gonna praise You Lord every day of my life 
 You give me freedom and it makes me shout 
 It makes me get up and dance! 
 Get up and dance 
 C'mon everybody are you ready to sing?

 You give me freedom and it makes me shout 
 It makes me get up and dance! 
 Get up and dance

 It makes me get up and dance!

 You give me freedom and it makes me shout 
 It makes me get up and dance! 
 Get up and dance 
 Get up and dance

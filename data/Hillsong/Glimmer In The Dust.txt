I was lost in a moment, a glimmer in time 
 Like a child chasing shadows, my back to the light 
 I was lost in a fog till You caught my eye 
 Through the smoke and the mirrors, a glimmer of life 
 I know there's a place I belong 
 Where I'll see the fullness of love 
 A child face to face with my God 
 Lost in Your awesome wonder 
 While I wait, I will not be afraid 
 My faith will remain all the same 
 My hope in the things not yet seen 
 Found in the greatest of these 
 I found love in a moment, exploding in light 
 At the cross where the curtains, were ripped from my eyes 
 I found heaven in pieces, in glimmer and dust 
 Broken glass in reflection, till we shine like the sun 
 I know there's a place I belong 
 Where I'll see the fullness of love 
 A child face to face with my God 
 Lost in Your awesome wonder 
 While I wait, I will not be afraid 
 My faith will remain all the same 
 My hope in the things not yet seen 
 Found in the greatest of these 
 I know that You love me 
 I know that You love me 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails 
 When all's said and done 
 All that matters is love (I know that You love me) 
 So let love take over (I know that You love me) 
 Not just in part but in all that You are (Your love never fails) 
 Let Your love take over (Your love never fails) 
 When all's said and done 
 All that matters is love (I know that You love me)

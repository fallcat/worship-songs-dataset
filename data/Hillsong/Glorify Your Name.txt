Jesus Jesus 
 Holy One, God's precious Son 
 You gave 
 Jesus Jesus 
 On the cross You took my shame 
 Forever from my heart I'll say 
 I live to worship You, Lord 
 My King of glory 
 Brought me to life 
 Gave me wings to fly 
 You are holy 
 Heaven and earth declare Your praise 
 Both now and evermore 
 I glorify Your name 
 Jesus Jesus 
 On the cross You took my sin 
 Forever from my heart I'll sing 
 You are holy 
 Glorify Your name 
 Jesus Jesus Jesus 
 I glorify Your name

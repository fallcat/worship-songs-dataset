When the mountains fall and the tempest roars 
 You are with me 
 When creation folds 
 Still my soul will soar on Your mercy 
 I'll walk through the fire with my head lifted high 
 And my spirit revived in Your story 
 And I'll look to the cross as my failure is lost 
 In the light of Your glorious grace 
 (So) let the ruins come to life 
 In the beauty of Your Name 
 Rising up from the ashes 
 God forever You reign 
 And my soul will find refuge 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 I will love You forever and forever I'll sing 
 When the world caves in 
 Still my hope will cling to Your promise 
 Where my courage ends 
 Let my heart find strength in Your presence 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh

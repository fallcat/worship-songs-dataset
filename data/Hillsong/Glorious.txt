Your love endures forever 
 Reaches beyond the heavens 
 I will praise, I will praise 
 Your love is better than life 
 Your name alone satisfies 
 I will sing, I will sing 
 You are my God, You are my song 
 You are my love, I am found in You 
 Your holiness, Your majesty 
 Your presence fills my life 
 And the earth will shake, the skies light up 
 They join with us 
 Live to make Your praises glorious, glorious 
 No longer I who live it 
 It's Christ who lives in me 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I'm planted deep within You 
 My heart and soul will sing 
 Forevermore, forevermore 
 You are my God, You are my song 
 You are my love, I am found in You 
 Your holiness, Your majesty 
 Your presence fills my life 
 And the earth will shake, the skies light up 
 They join with us 
 Live to make Your praises glorious, glorious

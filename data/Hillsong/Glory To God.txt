Let the earth rejoice heavens comes to you 
 While the city sleeps a child is born 
 Drive away the fear for you Saviour has come 
 He lies in a bed made of straw 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la 
 La la la 
 La lal la la la la 
 Glory to glory to God 
 In the highest 
 Glory to glory to God 
 In the highest 
 Glory, glory in the highest

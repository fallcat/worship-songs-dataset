Lord, my heart cries out, glory to the King 
 My greatest love in life, I hand You everything 
 Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing 
 Open my ears, let me hear Your voice 
 To know that sweet sound, oh my soul rejoice 
 Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing 
 You're the Father to the fatherless 
 The answer to my dreams 
 I see You crowned in righteousness 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Comforter to the lonely, the Lifter of my head 
 I see You veiled in majesty 
 We cry glory, glory, we cry glory to the King 
 We cry glory, glory, we cry glory to the King 
 Lord, my heart cries out, glory to the King 
 My greatest love in life, I hand You everything 
 Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing 
 Open my ears, let me hear your voice 
 To know that sweet sound, oh my soul rejoice 
 Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing 
 You're the Father to the fatherless 
 The answer to my dreams 
 I see You crowned in righteousness 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Comforter to the lonely, the Lifter of my head 
 I see you veiled in majesty 
 We cry glory, glory, we cry glory to the King 
 We cry glory, glory, we cry glory to the King 
 You're the Father to the fatherless 
 The answer to my dreams 
 I see You crowned in righteousness 
 We cry glory to the King 
 Comforter to the lonely, the lifter of my head 
 I see You veiled in majesty 
 We cry glory, glory, we cry glory to the King (x3) 
 Glory to the King (x3)

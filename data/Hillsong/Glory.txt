Great is the Lord, God Almighty 
 Great is the Lordon high 
 The train of His robe fills the temple 
 And we cry out highest praise 
 Glory to the risen King 
 Glory to the son 
 Glorious son 
 Lift up your heads open the doors 
 Let the King of glory come in 
 And forever be our God 
 Holy is the Lord, God Almighty 
 Hloy is the Lord on High 
 Let all the earth bow before You 
 And crown You Lord of all

Lost and stranded 
 Empty handed 
 Broken down and all alone 
 Your mercy, it entered 
 Into darkness 
 And enfolded us in love 
 We give You all we are 
 For the glory of Your name 
 We give all we are 
 For Your praise 
 Just a glimmer 
 Of Your glory 
 And the Earth falls to it's knees 
 You leveln the mountains 
 With a whisper 
 And You calm the raging seas 
 We give You all we are 
 For the glory of Your name 
 We give all we are 
 For Your praise 
 Let the Earth come to life 
 In the light of Heaven's glow 
 And the streets sound with joy 
 As the shackles lose their hold 
 You laid down Your life 
 For one and all 
 So we give all we are 
 To You alone 
 This means freedom 
 For the captives 
 And good news for those in need 
 You message, is justice 
 And compassion 
 God of Love and Prince of Peace 
 We give You all we are 
 For the glory of Your name 
 We give all we are 
 For Your praise 
 Let the Earth come to life 
 In the light of Heaven's glow 
 And the streets sound with joy 
 As the shackles lose their hold 
 You laid down Your life 
 For one and all 
 So we give all we are 
 To You alone, you alone 
 With one voice we sing Hallelujah 
 All the Earth cry out Hallelujah 
 With the angels sing Hallelujah 
 Jesus Christ is King 
 Let the Earth come to life 
 In the light of Heaven's glow 
 And the streets sound with joy 
 As the shackles lose their hold 
 You laid down Your life 
 For one and all 
 So we give all we are 
 To You alone 
 We give everything 
 To you alone 
 We give everything 
 To you alone 
 We give everything 
 To you alone 
 We give everything

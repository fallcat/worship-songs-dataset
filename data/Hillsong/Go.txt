We're giving it all away, away 
 We're giving it all to go Your way 
 We're giving it all away, away 
 We're giving it all to go Your way 
 In the Father there is freedom 
 There is hope in the name that is Jesus 
 Lay Your life down, give it all now 
 We are found in the love of the Saviour 
 We've come alive in You 
 Set free to show the truth 
 Our lives will never be the same 
 We're giving it all away, away 
 W're giving it all to go Your way 
 Away we're singing 
 We are sold out to Your calling 
 Everything that we are for Your glory 
 Take our hearts now, have it all now 
 Let our lives shine the light like the morning 
 We've come alive in You 
 Set free to show the truth 
 Our lives will never be the same 
 We're giving it all away, away 
 We're giving it all to go Your way 
 We're giving it all away, away 
 We're giving it all to go Your way 
 Away we're singing 
 Roll back the curtains from our eyes 
 And now we can see You 
 Shown us Your way, Your truth and life 
 We offer our lives to bring You fame 
 We're caught in Your freedom 
 We're caught in Your freedom 
 We're giving it all away, away 
 We're giving it all to go Your way 
 We're giving it all away, away 
 We're giving it all to go Your way 
 Away we're singing

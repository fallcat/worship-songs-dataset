Awesome in this place 
 (2x) 
 Here in this house of the Great King 
 We've come together now to worship him 
 This house is built on Christ Our Rock 
 Cannot be shaken 
 Cannot be shaken 
 God is awesome in this place 
 We sense his presence... as we sing his praise 
 There is power here for a miracle 
 Set the captive free 
 Make the broken whole 
 God is awesome 
 He's so awesome 
 God is awesome in this place

 I've found where I belong 
 I'm a living stone 
 In this house 
 I will grow

 There is power here for a miracle

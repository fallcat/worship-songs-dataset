God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 For unmerited favor I stand up and say 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 For unmerited favor I stand up and say 
 God is good all the time 
 He made a road in the wilderness 
 I used to be lost but now I'm free 
 God is good 
 He would have left His throne in glory 
 If there was nobody else but me 
 God is good 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 For unmerited favor I stand up and say 
 God is good all the time 
 I used to feel I was all alone 
 I was looking for peace in my mind 
 God is good 
 Then Jesus showed me a better way 
 That's the reason I testify that 
 God is good, so good 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 For unmerited favor I stand up and say 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 God is good all the time 
 For unmerited favor I stand up and say 
 God is good all the time 
 And I'm gonna testify, God is good 
 I wanna testify, God is good 
 I wanna testify, God is good 
 I wanna testify, God is good 
 I wanna testify, God is good 
 I wanna testify, God is good 
 I wanna testify, God is good

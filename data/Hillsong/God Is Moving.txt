Holy Spirit, Touch Your people 
 Teach us the ways of God 
 And as we live, As Jesus did 
 You are honored and lifted up 
 There's a stirring in the Spirit 
 There's an urgency in this hour 
 We as children must obey 
 Can you hear 
 The footsteps of God 
 God is moving, God is moving 
 Can you hear the sound 
 Of revival 
 As we praise You, as we sing 
 Draw near to us O God 
 As we cry out for the nations 
 Pour out revival in the land 
 There's a stirring in the Spirit 
 There's an urgency in this hour 
 We as children must obey 
 Can you hear 
 The footsteps of God

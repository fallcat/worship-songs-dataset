I'm totally abandoned to You 
 I'm lost inside the rivers of Your love 
 I'm swept into the power of Your presence 
 Drawn toward the whisper of Your voice 
 I come to You in quiet adoration 
 And fall before Your feet You are my King 
 I'm living for the beauty of Your Presence 
 To behold the glory of Your face 
 Holy, Worthy, is the Lord 
 Heaven declares Your Rightousness 
 Oh God of All Creation 
 I worship You 
 Oh when You said 'seek Your face' 
 My heart said 'Your face I will seek' (2x)

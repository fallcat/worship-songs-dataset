In a world that's lost and seeking 
 You're the answer to every need, I know 
 It's You alone 
 I find a hope for all my life 
 I'm living as a sacrifice, for You 
 In freedom and in truth 
 Always, I know 
 You are here and You live in me 
 In my life, You're the only one I need 
 Jesus I believe 
 You're the one who saved my soul 
 You gave me life, so I 
 Give it back to You 
 My God, God one and only 
 Now I stand in Your salvation 
 I keep the faith and I fix my life, on You 
 My hope is found in You 
 Jesus 
 Always, I know 
 You are here and You live in me 
 In my life, You're the only one I need 
 Jesus I believe 
 You're the one who saved my soul 
 You gave me life, so I 
 Give it back to You 
 My God, God one and only 
 You're the one who saved my soul 
 You gave me life, so I 
 Give it back to You 
 My God, God one and only 
 You chose the cross and You took my place 
 And I believe it 
 This is love that I can't explain 
 Yes I believe it 
 You chose the cross and You took my place 
 And I believe it 
 This is love that I can't explain 
 Yes I believe it 
 You're the one who saved my soul 
 You gave me life, so I 
 Give it back to You 
 My God, God one and only 
 You're the one who saved my soul 
 You gave me life, so I 
 Give it back to You 
 My God, God one and only 
 God one and only 
 God one and only

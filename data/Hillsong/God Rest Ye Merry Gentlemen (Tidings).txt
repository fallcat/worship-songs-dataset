God rest ye merry gentlemen 
 Let nothing you dismay 
 Remember Christ our Savior 
 Was born on Christmas Day 
 From God our heav'nly Father 
 A blessed angel came 
 And unto certain shepherds 
 Brought tidings of the same 
 How that in Bethlehem was born 
 The son of God by name 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
 Comfort and joy 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
 Comfort and joy 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
 Now, to the Lord sing praises 
 All you within this place 
 And with true love and brotherhood 
 Each other now embrace 
 This holy tide of Christmas 
 All others doth deface 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
 Comfort and joy 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy 
 Comfort and joy 
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy

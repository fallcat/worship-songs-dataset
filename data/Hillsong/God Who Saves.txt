The light of the world 
 Shining in love 
 Taking the fall upon Your shoulders 
 You shattered the dark 
 As You rose to life again 
 You search all the earth 
 For those who are lost 
 And leaving the rescued for the fallen 
 You're leading us home 
 As we call upon Your Name 
 You're the God who saves 
 You're the hope of all 
 Reaching out Your hand 
 As Your people call 
 Our Saviour has come 
 Let Your will be done 
 Your kingdom on earth as in the heavens 
 Our freedom is found 
 Lord in no other Name 
 You are the Way 
 The Truth and the Life 
 Your mercy has overcome our failings 
 The battle is won 
 Jesus in love You reign 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh 
 Here in Your light ever brighter 
 We lift Your Name higher and higher

God You make me smile as I look to You 
 And I never thought life could be so cool 
 I'm so free to be me 
 We're a generation who will live for You 
 Nothing's gonna stop us from loviong You 
 We believe in Jesus 
 Life is fun, and I'm so happy You're my friend and King 
 I raise my hands to praise Your Name 
 I am not ashamed, praise Your Name, Jesus

I've found my meaning in You 
 Your cause is the reason why I live 
 Your grace is teaching me how to give 
 I give my whole life to You 
 Your love is the reason why I song 
 Jesus You are my everything 
 Every night, everyday 
 I don't need to worry, no I celebrate 
 All the things You've done in me 
 And it's gonna be all right, cause 
 You are in my life 
 Yes it's gonna be all right 
 Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be all right 
 And it's gonna be all right, 
 'Cause Jesus, you're my light 
 And You have shown me the way 
 All of my troubles, all of my life 
 I give to You, my king

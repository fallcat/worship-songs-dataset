You lay aside Your throne 
 And to this world 
 You have come 
 You offered up Your life 
 The debt You paid 
 Was not Yours 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 Jesus 
 In You I find all that I need 
 A gift I could not earn 
 Your open arms 
 Are undeserved 
 Enabled by Your grace 
 Now to live 
 Is Christ alone 
 All powerful 
 All glorious 
 There's nothing like the Name of Jesus 
 All powerful 
 All glorious 
 There's nothing like Your Name

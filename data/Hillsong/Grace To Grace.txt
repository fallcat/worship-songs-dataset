If love endured that ancient cross 
 How precious is my Saviour's blood 
 The beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame 
 The image of love upon death's frame 
 If having my heart was worth the pain 
 What joy could You see beyond the grave 
 If love found my soul worth dying for 
 How wonderful 
 How glorious 
 My Saviour's scars 
 Victorious 
 My chains are gone 
 My debt is paid 
 From death to life 
 And grace to grace 
 If heaven now owns that vacant tomb 
 How great is the hope that lives in You 
 The passion that tore through hell like a rose 
 The promise that rolled back death and its stone 
 If freedom is worth the life You raised 
 Where is my sin, where is my shame 
 If love paid it all to have my heart 
 How wonderful 
 How glorious 
 My Saviour's scars 
 Victorious 
 My chains are gone 
 My debt is paid 
 From death to life 
 And grace to grace 
 When I see that cross I see freedom 
 When I see that grave I'll see Jesus 
 And from death to life I will sing Your praise 
 In the wonder of Your grace

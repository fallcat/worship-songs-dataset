Your love towers over me 
 Gracious tempest in the sea 
 Surround me like a storm 
 Let Your tide of mercy rain 
 Let it flood in my heart again 
 Surround me like an ocean 
 Your love is crashing over me 
 Surging like a raging sea 
 Immerse me in the wonder of Your love 
 A downpour of unending grace 
 Consuming all my reckless ways 
 My sins submerged 
 Your love has saved my soul 
 Your love is like a storm 
 Your love is crashing over me 
 It's surging like a raging sea 
 Immerse me in the wonder of Your love 
 A downpour of unending grace 
 Consuming all my reckless ways 
 My sins submerged 
 Your love has saved my soul 
 Your love is like a storm 
 Your love is like a storm 
 Your love is like a storm 
 Your love is like a storm

From the moment I opened my heart 
 You gave me Your love from heaven above 
 King of Glory, Jesus You'll always be mine 
 Lord I love You, it's all I can say 
 You amaze me every moment, every day 
 My creator, Jesus my Lord, always 
 From the depths of my heart to the heaven above 
 There I feel Your embrace and the warmth of Your love 
 I'm not afraid 'cause Jesus I know You are here 
 You are here... 
 You're my Saviour, redeeming grace 
 Generations will sing of Your praise 
 Be exalted forever and ever more 
 Back to CHORUS 
 *Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise 
 Great is the Lord, glorified 
 * ---- Repeated 
 (Glorified...) 
 Back to CHORUS (2x) 
 You are here... 
 From the depths of my heart and to the heaven above 
 You are here 
 There I feel Your embrace and the warmth of Your love 
 You are here 
 Na na na na... na na na na na... (repeated)

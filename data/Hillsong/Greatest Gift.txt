Condemnation falls away 
 Never more to call on me and I am clean, yes I am clean 
 The powerful work of you in me 
 Breaks the chains of guilt and shame and I go free, yes I go free 
 I take them to your cross and leave them there 
 Captured by this grace I'm free at last 
 It is the great gift of Your salvation 
 Working in me, working in me 
 It is the life giving taste of heaven 
 Your kindness revealed, Your kindness revealed to me 
 It's the greatest gift of all 
 It's the greatest gift of all 
 It's the greatest gift of all (Repeat x4) 
 Your mercy's pouring down on me, Your mercy's pouring down on me 
 And I am clean, I am clean 
 Your mercy's pouring down on me, Your mercy's pouring down on me 
 And I go free, I go free

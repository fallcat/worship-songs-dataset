I could chase after greatness 
 First to fall on my knees 
 Lose myself to be found 
 Where You want me 
 I could do all the right things 
 Sing the words till they bleed 
 But I know it's just noise 
 If I don't have love 
 So I won't waste my breath 
 If it's not for love 
 I don't have the heart 
 If it's not for love 
 Don't let me say it's faith 
 If it counts no cost 
 'Cause there's no fear in love 
 But there is a cross 
 I could speak like the angels 
 Prophesy knowing all 
 I could live with the faith 
 To move mountains 
 And should I die like a martyr 
 Give my wealth to the poor 
 It would all scream loud-nothing 
 If I don't have love 
 So I won't waste my breath 
 If it's not for love 
 I don't have the heart 
 If it's not for love 
 Don't let me say it's faith 
 If it counts no cost 
 'Cause there's no fear in love 
 But there is a cross 
 Be patient, be kind 
 Hold no envy or pride 
 Be the first to come last 
 For another 
 Never forced, slow to anger 
 Trust without keeping score 
 Long to suffer with truth 
 Love will never die 
 Oh I won't waste my breath 
 If it's not for love 
 I don't have the heart 
 If it's not for love, no 
 Don't let me say it's faith 
 If it counts no cost 
 'Cause there's no fear in love 
 But there is a cross 
 Love will never die 
 But there is a cross

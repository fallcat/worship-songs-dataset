Saved by Your mercy 
 Found in Your grace 
 Totally surrendered to Your embrace 
 And there's nothing more than You 
 See Your perfection 
 I'm lost in Your peace 
 Your faithfulness sings over me 
 And Your love is the light of my soul 
 And I lift my eyes to You 
 Creator of the world 
 And I stand in awe of You 
 Of Your glory 
 And I live to worship You 
 Son of God, King of Heaven 
 King of Heaven, Jesus 
 I am saved by Your mercy 
 Saved by Your mercy 
 Found in Your grace 
 Totally surrendered to Your embrace 
 And there's nothing more than You 
 See Your perfection 
 I'm lost in Your peace 
 Your faithfulness sings over me 
 And Your love is the light of my soul 
 And I lift my eyes to You 
 Creator of the world 
 And I stand in awe of You 
 Of Your glory 
 And I live to worship You 
 Son of God, King of Heaven 
 And the Angels round Your throne 
 Cry out "Holy 
 To the one who is to come 
 Hear us sing Hallelujah" 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Through Christ you first loved me 
 Be no greater price than this 
 The One who died for me 
 Rose from death, I stand with Thee 
 Now we sing salvation song 
 For the Savior's perfect love 
 Cleanse my soul and mercies dear 
 Blessed grace delivers me 
 Hallelujah, He is greater 
 Hallelujah, Jesus my Savior 
 Strength and hope for our days 
 Faith to move the mountains clear 
 Priceless love You give to us 
 It's not bound by what we do 
 Hallelujah, He is greater 
 Hallelujah, Jesus my Savior 
 Hallelujah, He is greater 
 Hallelujah, Jesus my Savior 
 Love of Jesus set me free 
 The love paid this price for me 
 His life He gave, love remains 
 Holy Lord 
 Love of Jesus set me free 
 The love paid this price for me 
 His life He gave, love remains 
 Holy Lord 
 Hallelujah, He is greater 
 Hallelujah, Jesus my Savior

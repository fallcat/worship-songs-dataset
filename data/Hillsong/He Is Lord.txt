Oh blessed lamb once slain 
 Will reign forever more 
 His hands once bound now save 
 Our God will never fail 
 He is Lord 
 He is Lord 
 Sings my soul 
 He is Lord 
 And He lives 
 Yes He lives 
 I'm alive 'cause Jesus lives 
 'Tis at the cross of Christ 
 Where earth and heaven meet 
 Where sin is overcome 
 To God the victory 
 And now 
 Let the earth resound with praise 
 For our Saviour God He reigns 
 He is high and lifted up 
 Arise 
 For the King of glory waits 
 He is coming back again

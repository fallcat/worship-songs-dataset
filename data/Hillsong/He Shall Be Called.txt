(Words and music Russell Frager) 
 Come on everyone on your feet 
 This is good news sounds so sweet 
 Jesus is the Lord of all 
 And He will answer when you call 
 When Jesus rules inside your heart 
 That is where His Kingdom starts 
 Jesus is the coming King 
 And this is what the angels sing 
 He shall be called 
 Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God 
 And His mighty Kingdom 
 His Kingdom will never end 
 And He shall be called 
 The Prince of Peace 
 Justice and Righteousness 
 And His mighty Kingdom 
 His Kingdom will never end

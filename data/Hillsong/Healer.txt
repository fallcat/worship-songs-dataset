You hold my every moment 
 You calm my raging seas 
 You walk with me through fire 
 And heal all my disease 
 I trust in You 
 I trust in You 
 I believe You're my healer 
 I believe You are all I need 
 I believe You're my portion 
 I believe You're more than enough for me 
 Jesus, You're all I need 
 Nothing is impossible for You 
 Nothing is impossible 
 Nothing is impossible for You 
 You hold my world in Your hands

May our homes be filled with dancing 
 May our streets be filled with joy. 
 May injustice bow to Jesus 
 As the people turn to pray. 
 From the mountains to the valleys 
 Hear our praises rise to You, 
 From the heavens to the nations 
 Hear our singing fill the air. 
 May Your light shine in the darkness 
 As we walk before the cross 
 May Your glory fill the whole earth 
 As the water o'er seas. 
 From the mountains to the valleys 
 Hear our praises rise to You, 
 From the heavens to the nations 
 Hear our singing fill the air. 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah... 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah... 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah... 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah... 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah... 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah... 
 From the mountains to the valleys 
 Hear our praises rise to You, 
 From the heavens to the nations 
 Hear our singing fill the air."

Hear our prayer, Spirit, come 
 How I long for Your sweet touch 
 On my knees I cry out 
 Jesus, Savior behold Your child 
 Like a deer longing for water 
 My soul yearns 
 Only You can fill my deep hunger 
 My heart burns, my heart burns 
 Hear our prayer, Spirit, come 
 How I long for Your sweet touch 
 On my knees I cry out 
 Jesus, Savior behold Your child 
 Like a deer longing for water 
 My soul yearns 
 Only You can fill my deep hunger 
 My heart burns, my heart burns 
 Like a deer longing for water 
 My soul yearns 
 Only You can fill my deep hunger 
 My heart burns, my heart burns 
 Oceans deep, mountains high 
 Oh my God, I cannot live without Your love 
 I cannot live without Your love 
 Like a deer longing for water 
 My soul yearns 
 Only you can fill my deep hunger 
 My heart burns, my heart burns 
 Like a deer longing for water 
 My soul yearns 
 Only you can fill my deep hunger 
 My heart burns, my heart burns 
 My heart burns, my heart burns 
 My heart burns, my soul yearns for You 
 My heart burns, my heart burns 
 Oh it's for You, my heart burns

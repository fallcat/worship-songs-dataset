Holy 
 No measure knows Your worth 
 Face down 
 Where mercy finds me first 
 If You sought perfection 
 I'd die trying to reach it 
 But this broken heart is all You want 
 Singing holy 
 Heart like heaven 
 Singing holy 
 God Almighty 
 Own this heart broke sound 
 Singing holy is Your Name 
 Singing holy is Your Name 
 Own the sound forever 
 Heart and heaven together 
 Singing holy is Your Name 
 And if it lifts You higher 
 Burn in me Your desire 
 A passion worthy of Your Name 
 And I'll throw my weakness 
 Into Your greatness 
 If this broken heart is all You want 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 For You are worthy 
 Jesus Savior 
 You are worthy 
 King forever 
 Hear my soul cry out 
 Singing holy is Your Name

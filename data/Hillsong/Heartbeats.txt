Love strung out 
 I am found in the price You paid 
 I know that Your life 
 Is the blood running through my veins 
 My eyes fixed wide 
 On the light of the cross again 
 I feel the weight drop 
 In the wake of the empty grave 
 I want You I need You 
 I love You Jesus 
 My heart beats forever just to know You 
 Let go and throw my 
 Future into Your hands (again) 
 Heart beats loud 
 To the sound of a different drum 
 Calling me out from the crowd 
 To pursue the One 
 Break me down until I soar on grace 
 Lead me on through the fire and rain 
 The rhythm of my heart beats wild 
 For Your endless praise 
 Every waking hour I will seek Your face 
 (Ending) 
 Again 
 Again

Love that was foretold 
 When the prophets spoke 
 Of one to come 
 Heaven came for us 
 Reconciling hearts 
 To You our God 
 Heaven and earth collide 
 The Savior for everyone has come 
 Bringing the dead to life 
 All for the glory of Your name 
 Now He comes with hope 
 In salvation's robe 
 To lead us home 
 Healing in His wings 
 Freedom in His scars 
 His kingdom come 
 Heaven and earth collide 
 The Savior for everyone has come 
 Bringing the dead to life 
 All for the glory of Your name 
 By His stripes we are healed 
 By His death we can live 
 In Jesus name, in Jesus name 
 All oppression will cease 
 Every captive released 
 In Jesus name, in Jesus name 
 Heaven and earth collide 
 The Savior for everyone has come 
 Bringing the dead to life 
 All for the glory of Your name 
 By His stripes we are healed 
 By His death we can live 
 In Jesus name, in Jesus name 
 All oppression will cease 
 Every captive released 
 In Jesus name, in Jesus name

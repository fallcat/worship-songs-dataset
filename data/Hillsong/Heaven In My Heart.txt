If I could see beyond the sky, I'd look to see You smile 
 I'd look to Your majesty 
 If I could reach above the stars, I'd put my hands in Yours 
 You'd show me all eternity 
 But for now I close my eyes and pray 
 But for now I lift my hands and say 
 Jesus, You're my Saviour, You are heaven in my heart

Hold my heart, don't let it bleed no more 
 Sometimes forgiveness is like a man at war 
 God only knows why love is worth the fall 
 Maybe that's what makes it love 
 Maybe that's what makes it love 
 I can hear it now 
 The everlasting sound 
 Roaring like a lion deep within me 
 I won't hold it long 
 I wasn't made that strong 
 Sweet Surrender, hold my heart and not let go 
 I'm letting go 
 And Heaven knows 
 I love you so 
 Hold my heart, don't let it break like fear 
 Sometimes a moment feels like a thousand years 
 God only knows why is love is drenched in tears 
 Maybe that's what makes it love 
 Maybe that's what makes it love 
 Then sings my soul 
 Then sings my soul 
 How great your love is 
 How great your love is

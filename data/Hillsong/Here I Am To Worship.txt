Light of the world 
 You stepped down into darkness 
 Opened my eyes and let me see 
 Beauty that made this heart adore You 
 Hope of a life spent with You 
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 Altogether lovely, altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted 
 You're glorious in heaven above, yes You are 
 Humbly You came to this Earth You created 
 All for love's sake became poor 
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 Altogether lovely, altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin up on that cross 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin up on that cross 
 Here I am, here I am to worship You 
 Here I am to worship You 
 Help me sing 
 Here I am to worship You 
 Here I am to worship You 
 Here I am, here I am 
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 Altogether lovely, altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 Altogether lovely, altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 Wonderful to me, You're wonderful to me 
 You're lovely and You are worthy 
 Say, say wonderful, wonderful 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to worship

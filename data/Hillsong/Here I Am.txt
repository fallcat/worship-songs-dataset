This perfect love 
 You give to me 
 Compares to none 
 There has ever been 
 How can I give back to you 
 For all that you have given me 
 All you are 
 Is all I desire 
 Your gentle touch 
 Helps me survive 
 You're the air that I breathe 
 Heaven's gift to me 
 Take my heart 
 Take my life 
 Take all I am 
 I give it to you 
 Here I am 
 Before you I stand 
 No secrets to hide 
 I am yours 
 And you are mine 
 Lord I'm in love 
 Lord I'm in love

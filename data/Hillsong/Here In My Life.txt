I have never walked on water 
 Felt the waves beneath my feet but 
 At your Word Lord, I'll receive Your 
 Faith to walk on oceans deep 
 And I remember how You found me: 
 In that very same place 
 All my failing surely would've drowned me 
 But You made a way 
 You are my freedom 
 Jesus you're the reason 
 I'm kneeling again at Your throne 
 Where would I be without You 
 Here in my life, here in my life? 
 You have said that all the heavens 
 Sing for joy at one who finds 
 The way to freedom, truth of Jesus 
 Bought from death into His life 
 And I remember how You saw me: 
 Through the eyes of Your grace 
 And though the cost was Your beloved for me 
 Still you made a way!

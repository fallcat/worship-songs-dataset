Skies spin their dance within Your breath 
 Time runs its race within Your hand 
 And my mind runs wild to comprehend 
 What no mind on earth could understand 
 Your ways are higher 
 Your thoughts are wilder 
 Love came like madness 
 Poured out in blood - wash romance 
 It makes no sense but this is grace 
 And I know You're with me in this place 
 Here now all I know is that You are 
 Here now still my heart 
 Let your voice be all I hear now 
 Spirit breathe 
 Like the wind come have Your way 
 'Cause I know You're in this place 
 Faith makes a fool of what makes sense 
 But grace found my heart where logic ends 
 When justice called for all my debts 
 The Friend of sinners came instead 
 Here now all I know is that You are 
 Here now still my heart 
 Let your voice be all I hear now 
 Spirit breathe 
 Like the wind come have Your way 
 'Cause I know You're in this place 
 'Cause I know that You are here now 
 Heart and soul 
 God I know that You are here now 
 Fix my eyes 
 On the things that I can't see now 
 And all I see 
 Is the glory of Your name

When the sunlight breaks 
 And the day has just begun 
 In the still I wait for Your voice to lead me on 
 Eternity residing in my soul, oh 
 I follow You till the day You call me home 
 Here now with You 
 I have heaven in me 
 Everything's changed 
 And I will never be without You 
 Without You 
 From the dust I'm made 
 With Your calling on my life 
 And Your plan weaved 
 Into the fabric of my heart 
 Eternity residing in my soul, oh 
 I lift my eyes to the One who gave it all 
 I lift my eyes to the One who gave it all 
 Here now with You 
 I have heaven in me 
 Everything's changed 
 And I will never be without You 
 Always with You 
 Through Your Spirit in me 
 Everything's changed 
 And I will never be without You 
 Without You 
 You see me in the fire 
 Reaching out with open hands 
 You find me on my knees 
 Fill me with Your peace again 
 Forever I am loved 
 And freedom reigns in me 
 Forever You are Lord, my everything

Lord of all the earth 
 And all of heaven 
 I come and seek Your face 
 Worship You with all I have within me 
 Humbled by Your grace 
 Every heart every nation 
 Every tribe all creation 
 Will bow before Your presence and sing 
 You are high and lifted up 
 You are high and lifted up 
 And my soul sings hallelujah 
 To the Lamb 
 The Lamb of God 
 Lord of righteousness 
 You come in glory 
 Bright and morning star 
 All my days I'll worship and adore You 
 Healer of my heart 
 Every prayer every cry 
 You alone satisfy 
 We will lift Your praise 
 Again and again 
 Majesty 
 Majesty 
 Jesus Lamb of God 
 Majesty 
 Majesty 
 Holy are You Lord

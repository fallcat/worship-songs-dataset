For unto us a Saviour came 
 Amazing grace that takes the weight 
 His name is hope for all the earth 
 His name now and beyond this life 
 God with us 
 And You shall be called Almighty God 
 And we shall declare 
 Your name is higher higher 
 Jesus Christ Your name is glorious 
 Now unto me the Christ redeemed 
 For you so loved and love me still 
 And You shall be called Almighty God 
 And we shall declare 
 Your name is higher higher 
 Jesus Christ Your name is glorious 
 Your name is greater sweeter 
 In all the earth 
 Higher, higher, higher, He's higher (2x) 
 So great and greatly to be praised are You 
 So great and greatly to be praised (2x) 
 And you shall be called Almighty God, and we shall declare 
 He's higher, higher, higher, higher (2x) 
 I owe you my life, I will worship you forever 
 I owe you my life, I will live to bring you praise (4x)

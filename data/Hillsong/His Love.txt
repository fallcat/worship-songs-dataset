You're light is over me 
 Flooding over me 
 The night is lifted 
 Heaven over me 
 Flooding over me 
 I can't contain it 
 My cup overflows 
 My cup overflows 
 Praise the Lord 
 With all my heart 
 Praise Him for He 
 Has done great things 
 His banner over me is love 
 His love 
 His banner over me is love 
 His love 
 You brought the sunshine in 
 Turned the dark to day 
 You made the shadows flee away 
 You opened up my eyes 
 To a new and living way 
 The dawning of a brand new day

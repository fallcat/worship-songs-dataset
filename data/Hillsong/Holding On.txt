(Words and music Geoff Bullock) 
 Lord I'm holding on to You 
 Jesus 
 Closer and closer to You 
 And with all that I am 
 And in everything I do 
 I'm holding on to You 
 Called into Your presence 
 You're calling my name 
 In loving You and serving You 
 I'm transformed and changed 
 Reflecting Your glory 
 The image of God 
 So I'm holding on...

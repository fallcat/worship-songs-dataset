Holy Spirit, rain down, rain down 
 Oh, Comforter and Friend 
 How we need Your touch again 
 Holy Spirit, rain down, rain down 
 Let Your power fall 
 Let Your voice be heard 
 Come and change our hearts 
 As we stand on Your word 
 Holy Spirit, rain down 
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard 
 No mind can know what God has in store 
 So open up Heaven, open it wide 
 Over Your church and over our lives

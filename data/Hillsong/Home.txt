Into Your courts I'll run with 
 Praises flowing from my heart 
 Every day I wake I sing Your song 
 It's the anthem of my life 
 I wanna spend my days in Your presence Lord 
 Bowed before Your throne 
 In the house of God is where I've found my peace 
 It's where I've found my 
 Home is Heaven one day Lord I will live 
 In Your courts You'll find me in worship at Your feet 
 Hide me now in the shadow of Your wings 
 Where we'll be, where we'll be 
 Your love is all I need 
 So desperately I have sung Your fame 
 I know You hear my every cry 
 The petition that I make, yeah 
 I wanna spend my days in Your presence Lord 
 Bowed before Your throne 
 In the house of God is where I've found my peace 
 It's where I've found my 
 Home is Heaven one day Lord I will live 
 In Your courts You'll find me in worship at Your feet 
 Hide me now in the shadow of Your wings 
 Where we'll be, where we'll be 
 Home is Heaven one day Lord I will live 
 In Your courts You'll find me in worship at Your feet 
 Hide me now in the shadow of Your wings 
 Where we'll be, where we'll be 
 Jesus, oh You are my treasure 
 Jesus, oh You are my treasure 
 Jesus, oh You are my treasure 
 Jesus, oh Lord You are my treasure 
 I wanna spend my days in Your presence Lord 
 Bowed before Your throne 
 In the house of God is where I've found my peace 
 It's where I've found my 
 Home is Heaven one day Lord I will live 
 In Your courts You'll find me in worship at Your feet 
 Hide me now in the shadow of Your wings 
 Where we'll be, where we'll be 
 Home, home

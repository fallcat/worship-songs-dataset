How could I live without You 
 How could I survive 
 Without Your love 
 Without Your touch 
 You're the One that heals me 
 And cleanses my heart 
 And sets me free 
 Now I come right before You 
 With my hands lifted up 
 With my heart humbly bowed 
 At Your work on the cross 
 As You hang there and die 
 You were paying the price 
 For my life, For my life 
 For Your love is higher than the heavens 
 Deeper than the seas 
 And all I want is You in my life 
 No one else can satisfy my soul 
 Can make me feel this way 
 Only You Lord, only You

The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty 
 Let all the earth rejoice 
 All the earth rejoice 
 He wraps himself in Light, and darkness tries to hide 
 And trembles at His voice 
 Trembles at His voice 
 How great is our God, sing with me 
 How great is our God, and all will see 
 How great, how great is our God 
 Age to age He stands 
 And time is in His hands 
 Beginning and the end 
 Beginning and the end 
 The Godhead Three in One 
 Father Spirit Son 
 The Lion and the Lamb 
 The Lion and the Lamb 
 How great is our God, sing with me 
 How great is our God, and all will see 
 How great, how great is our God 
 Name above all names 
 Worthy of our praise 
 My heart will sing 
 How great is our God 
 Name above all names 
 Worthy of our praise 
 And my heart will sing 
 How great is our God 
 How great is our God, sing with me 
 How great is our God, and all will see 
 How great, how great is our God 
 How great is our God, sing with me 
 How great is our God, and all will see 
 How great, how great is our God 
 How great is our God, sing with me 
 How great is our God, and all will see 
 How great, how great Ã¯s our God

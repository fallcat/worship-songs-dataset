I feel your love right through my heart 
 My spirit lifted by yours 
 You are too great 
 To great for words 
 So hear the song of my heart 
 How I long 
 Father 
 How I long for you 
 Freedom is where you place your feet 
 Light always shines through the dark 
 Ever thought of you 
 For I am yours 
 Greatest of any rewards

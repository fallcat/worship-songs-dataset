The universe is at Your feet 
 Gives You praise evermore 
 The stars will light the sky for You 
 Always, God be praised 
 And we sing 
 The Lord is on high 
 The Lord is on high 
 I adore You 
 I adore You 
 And there's none that compares 
 To Your majesty, oh Lord 
 I adore You 
 I adore You 
 And I stand 
 In the wonder of Your love 
 We will crown You 
 King forever 
 Living savior 
 Jesus redeemer 
 Lord of heaven 
 Robed in majesty 
 Crowned in glory 
 Creation adores You 
 Holy, holy 
 God almighty 
 And forever 
 The Lord is exalted 
 Hear the angels 
 Shout His anthem 
 Ever living 
 God we adore You

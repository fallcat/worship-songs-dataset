I believe I'm sanctified restored 
 I believe 
 I believe forgiven and transformed 
 I believe 
 I believe I'm righteous and reformed 
 I believe 
 I believe oh yes my God 
 I believe 
 I'm reaching out 
 'Cause I know there's a better way 
 I walk by faith 
 I believe in a better day 
 I'm holding on holding on to You 
 I believe I'm sanctified restored 
 I believe 
 I believe forgiven and transformed 
 I believe 
 I believe I'm righteous and reformed 
 I believe 
 I believe oh yes my God 
 I believe 
 I'm singing out 
 'Cause I've heard all the angels say 
 I can't hold back 
 'Cause I know You will come one day 
 I'm holding on holding on to You 
 I believe I'm sanctified restored 
 I believe 
 I believe forgiven and transformed 
 I believe 
 I believe I'm righteous and reformed 
 I believe 
 I believe oh yes my God 
 I believe

Maybe it's a little bit crazy to believe in what I cannot see 
 Maybe it's a little bit crazy that my best friend is my Saviour 
 Maybe it's a little bit crazy that a King would give His life for me 
 Maybe it's a little bit crazy but I've heard much stranger 
 'Cause some things you gotta see by faith 
 Jump up and down (Hey!) Jump up and down (hey!) 
 I don't care what people say 
 Jump up and down (Hey!) Jump up and down (Hey!) 
 I'm gonna shout it out, I believe in Jesus

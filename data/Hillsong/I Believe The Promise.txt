I believe the promise 
 About the visions 
 And the dreams 
 That the Holy Spirit 
 Will be poured out 
 And His power will be seen 
 Well the time is now 
 The place is here 
 And His people have 
 Come in faith 
 There's a mighty sound 
 And a touch of fire 
 When we're gathered 
 In one place 
 I believe that the Presence of God is here 
 There's not one thing 
 That can't be changed 
 When the spirit 
 Of God is near 
 I believe that the Presence of God is here 
 When two or three are gathered 
 When people rise in faith 
 I believe God answers 
 And His presence 
 Is in this place 
 Nothing on earth or Heaven 
 Can stop the power of God 
 Into our hands is given 
 The call to take it on 
 No ocean can contain it 
 No star can rise above 
 Into our hearts is given 
 The power of His love

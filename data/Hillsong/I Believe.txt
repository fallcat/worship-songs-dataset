Now I know there's a better way 
 I love You more and more each day 
 I put my faith in the one I love 
 And I believe in God above 
 And I believe, I believe, I 
 Believe in the son of God 
 And I'm alive in you Jesus 
 No one could ever save my soul but You 
 Forever forever 
 Forever 
 I'll praise Your name

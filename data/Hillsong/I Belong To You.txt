Open arms welcome me close to your heart 
 And there I long to stay 
 Mercy Falls cleansing my heart with your love 
 Whiter than the snow 
 I belong to you 
 Jesus my first love 
 Your everything I'm living for 
 You're the joy I know the treasure I hold dear 
 I burn for you 
 My eternal love 
 Take my life, join me forever with you 
 Make our heart as one 
 Perfect love 
 Driving away all my fear 
 Freedom I've found 
 I belong to you 
 Jesus my first love 
 Your everything I'm living for 
 Your the joy I know the treasure I hold dear 
 I burn for you 
 My eternal love

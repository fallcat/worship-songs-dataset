I desire Jesus 
 Precious Lamb 
 Who ransomed me 
 Upon the cross 
 He took my sin 
 By His blood 
 Has set me free 
 I desire Jesus 
 Oh His Name 
 My soul esteem 
 For upon 
 His thorn-scarred brow 
 Is the crown of victory 
 He is worthy of all honour 
 All glory to His Name 
 He alone deserves 
 Our highest praise 
 And forever He will reign 
 I desire Jesus 
 Triumphant One 
 The earth awaits 
 For on that day 
 The earth will shine 
 With the glory of Your Name 
 You are worthy of all honour 
 All glory to Your Name 
 You alone deserve 
 Our highest praise 
 And forever You will reign 
 You are all glorious 
 You are all glorious 
 My heart leans in 
 My soul must sing 
 You are all glorious 
 I desire Jesus 
 Precious Lamb 
 Who ransomed me 
 Unto You an offering 
 Will my life forever be

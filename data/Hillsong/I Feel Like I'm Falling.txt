Standing tall in this wide space 
 Getting lost in Your embrace 
 I see a fire burning brighter 
 It's calling me to catch the flame 
 Oh Lord, I feel like I'm falling over and over in love with You 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 I feel like I'm falling into the arms of the mighty God 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 Oh Lord, You're drawing me closer to Your side 
 It's the safest place I know where to hide 
 With one glance You captured my heart 
 You speak Your words, You speak Your words that set me apart 
 Hallelujah 
 I feel like I'm falling over and over in love with You 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 I feel like I'm falling into the arms of the mighty God 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 I feel like I'm falling over and over in love with You 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 I feel like I'm falling into the arms of the mighty God 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling 
 I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love 
 I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling 
 I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love 
 I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling 
 I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love 
 I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling 
 I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love 
 I feel like I'm falling over and over in love with You 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 I feel like I'm falling into the arms of the mighty God 
 It's not just a feeling but I know that He is real 
 He is real, He is real, thank You Lord 
 I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling 
 I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love 
 I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling 
 I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love

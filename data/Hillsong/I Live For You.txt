The day I found You, 
 You made my world brand new, 
 And You covered it with love 
 Changed my direction, 
 And now I'm heaven bound 
 I'm running to You 
 Once lost, but now I'm found in You 
 Once shipwrecked now I'm grateful these days 
 I live for You 
 Like a river, You flood my soul with love 
 Overflowing into joy 
 Like a downpour, Your spirit raining down 
 Let it fall, Let it fall 
 I'm living for the King 
 I live for You

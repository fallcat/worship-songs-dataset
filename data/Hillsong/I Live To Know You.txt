Standing in our presence 
 Lord, my heart and life are changed 
 Just to love You and to live to 
 See Your beauty and Your grace 
 Heaven and earth cry out Your name 
 Nations rise up and seek Your face 
 And Your Kingdom is established 
 As I live to know You more 
 Now I will never be the same 
 Spirit of God, my life You've changed 
 And I'll forever sing Your praise 
 I live to know You, Lord (x2) 
 You've called me, I will follow 
 Your will for me I'm sure 
 Let Your heart beat feel my heart's cry 
 Let me live to serve Your call 
 Heaven and earth cry out Your name 
 Nations rise up and seek Your face 
 And Your Kingdom is established 
 As I live to know You more 
 I live to know You, Lord (x2) 
 Heaven and earth cry out Your name 
 Nations rise up and seek Your face 
 And Your Kingdom is established 
 As I live to know You more 
 Now I will never be the same 
 Spirit of God, my life You've changed 
 And I'll forever sing Your praise 
 I live to know You, Lord 
 I live to know You, Lord 
 I live to know You, Lord (x4)

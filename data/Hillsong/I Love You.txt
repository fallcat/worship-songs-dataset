You gave a Son to save the world 
 You gave us love to show all the earth 
 We lift our voice to the sky, singing praise 
 Your Name on high 
 You make it seem like it's all a dream 
 I believe You created me and everything that I can see 
 I'll follow You in all that I do, I love You 
 I give my heart all to You 
 And everything that I do 
 I understand Your Word for me 
 Your holy power has set me free 
 The sun will rise the night will fall 
 And in the end You know all

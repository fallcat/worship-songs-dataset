Accepting I live favored of the Lord 
 Forgiven, by Your love I'm transformed 
 It's not what I do but what You've done for me 
 And by Your grace, oh God I stand with my head held high 
 I receive Your love 
 I receive Your love for me 
 I receive Your love 
 I know I am accepted 
 Establish every blemish in Your soul 
 Forever I am chosen to be loved 
 It's not by my words but by your work in me 
 And by Your grace, oh God I stand with my head held high 
 I receive Your love 
 I receive Your love for me 
 I receive Your love 
 I know I am accepted 
 A lot of things have been removed 
 My past has gone, my shame removed 
 You gave Your Son Your love for me 
 Now at the cross I've been made free 
 I receive Your love 
 I receive Your love for me 
 I receive Your love 
 I know I am accepted 
 I receive Your love 
 I receive Your love for me 
 I receive Your love 
 I know I am accepted

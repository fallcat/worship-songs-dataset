Say the word and I will sing for You 
 Over oceans deep, I will follow 
 If each star was a song 
 And every breath of wind, praise 
 It would still fail by far to say 
 All my heart contains 
 I simply live, I simply live for You 
 Say the word and I will sing for You 
 Over oceans deep, I will follow 
 If each star was a song 
 And every breath of wind, praise 
 It would still fail by far to say 
 All my heart contains 
 I simply live, I simply live for You 
 As the glory of Your presence 
 Now fills this place 
 In worship, we will meet You face to face 
 There is nothing in this world 
 To which You can be compared 
 Glory on glory, praise upon praise 
 You bind the broken hearted 
 And save all my tears 
 By Your word, You set the captives free 
 There is nothing in this world 
 That You cannot do 
 I simply live, I simply live for You 
 Say the word and I will sing for You 
 Over oceans deep, I will follow 
 If each star was a song 
 And every breath of wind, praise 
 It would still fail by far to say 
 All my heart contains 
 I simply live, I simply live for You 
 As the glory of Your presence 
 Now fills this place 
 In worship, we will meet You face to face 
 There is nothing in this world 
 To which You can be compared 
 Glory on glory, praise upon praise 
 You bind the broken hearted 
 And save all my tears 
 By Your word, You set the captives free 
 There is nothing in this world 
 That You cannot do 
 I simply live, I simply live for You 
 As the glory of Your presence 
 Now fills this place 
 In worship, we will meet You face to face 
 There is nothing in this world 
 To which You can be compared 
 Glory on glory, praise upon praise 
 You bind the broken hearted 
 And save all my tears 
 By Your word, You set the captives free 
 There is nothing in this world 
 That You cannot do 
 I simply live, I simply live for You 
 There is nothing in this world 
 That You cannot do 
 I simply live, I simply live for You

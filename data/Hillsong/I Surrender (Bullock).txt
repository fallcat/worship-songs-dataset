You're softening my heart 
 To the knowledge of Your love 
 And opening my eyes 
 You light the way to love You 
 Words alone cannot express 
 All the hope 
 That You have placed within me 
 In between each heartbeat Lord 
 I surrender 
 You gently pick me up 
 Wash me with Your love 
 And opening my ears 
 You speak the word 
 Healing releasing 
 All the hurts and fears 
 By the hope 
 That You have placed within me 
 In between each heartbeat Lord 
 I surrender 
 I surrender to You 
 I surrender to You 
 Ev'rything I am 
 And ever hope to be 
 I surrender to You 
 To You

Here I am 
 Down on my knees again 
 Surrendering all 
 Surrendering all 
 Find me here 
 Lord as You draw me near 
 Desperate for You 
 Desperate for You 
 I surrender 
 Drench my soul 
 As mercy and grace unfold 
 I hunger and thirst 
 I hunger and thirst 
 With arms stretched wide 
 I know You hear my cry 
 Speak to me now 
 Speak to me now 
 I surrender 
 I surrender 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to know You more 
 Like a rushing wind 
 Jesus breathe within 
 Lord have Your way 
 Lord have Your way in me 
 Like a mighty storm 
 Stir within my soul 
 Lord have Your way 
 Lord have Your way in me

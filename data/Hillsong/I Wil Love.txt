I will love you, Lord, my strength 
 I belong to you 
 And I will bless you while I live 
 And I will lift my hands up in your name. 
 Jesus, you alone are Holy 
 You alone are Holy 
 Name above every name 
 Lord Jesus, you alone are worthy 
 You alone are worthy 
 Jesus, the lamb that was slain. 
 Nailed to the cross for me 
 Died and rose again 
 You redeemed me to the father 
 By your blood 
 You cleansed me from all sin.

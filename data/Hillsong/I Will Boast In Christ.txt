All I have because of Jesus 
 All this promise 
 Won for me 
 When He paid the highest ransom 
 Once for always 
 For my freedom 
 I will boast in Christ alone 
 His righteousness 
 And not my own 
 I will cling to Christ my hope 
 His mercy reigns 
 Now and forever 
 Love will never lose its power 
 All my failures could not erase 
 And now I walk within Your favour 
 Grace unending 
 My salvation 
 I will boast in Christ alone 
 His righteousness 
 And not my own 
 I will cling to Christ my hope 
 His mercy reigns 
 Now and forever 
 What can wash away my sin? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can make me whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can wash away my sin? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can make me whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 I will boast in Christ alone 
 His righteousness 
 And not my own 
 I will cling to Christ my hope 
 His mercy reigns 
 Now and forever 
 What can wash away my sin? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can make me whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Oh precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow 
 No other fount I know 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus

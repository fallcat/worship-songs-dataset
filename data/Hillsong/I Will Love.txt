I will love you Lord, my strength, I belong to You 
 And I will bless you while I live 
 And I will lift my hands up in Your name 
 And Jesus, You alone are holy, You alone are holy 
 Name above every name 
 Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy, You alone are worthy 
 Jesus, the Lamb that was slain 
 Nailed to the cross for me, died and rose again 
 And You redeemed me to the Father by Your blood 
 You cleansed me from all sin 
 And Jesus, You alone are holy, You alone are holy 
 Name above every name 
 Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy, You alone are worthy 
 Jesus, the Lamb that was slain 
 Jesus, You alone are holy, You alone are holy 
 Name above every name 
 Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy, You alone are worthy 
 Jesus, the Lamb that was slain 
 And You redeemed me to the Father by Your blood 
 You cleansed me from all sin 
 And Jesus, You alone are holy, You alone are holy 
 Name above every name 
 Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy, You alone are worthy 
 Jesus, the Lamb that was slain 
 Jesus, You alone are holy, You alone are holy 
 Name above every name 
 Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy, You alone are worthy 
 Jesus, the Lamb that was slain

I will never be the same again. 
 I can never return I've closed the door 
 I will walk the path I'll run the race 
 And I will never be the same again 
 Fall like fire, soak like rain 
 Flow like mighty water 
 Again and again 
 Sweep away the darkness burn away the chaff 
 And let the flame 
 Burn to glory Your name 
 There are higher heights there are deeper seas 
 Whatever you need to do, lord do in me 
 The glory of God fills my life 
 And I will Never be the same again

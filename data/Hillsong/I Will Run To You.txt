Your eye is on the sparrow 
 And Your hand, it comforts me 
 From the ends of the Earth to the depth of my heart 
 Let Your mercy and strength be seen 
 You call me to Your purpose 
 As angels understand 
 For Your glory, may You draw all men 
 As Your love and grace demand 
 And I will run to You 
 To Your words of truth 
 Not by might, not by power 
 But by the Spirit of God 
 Yes, I will run the race 
 Till I see Your face 
 Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace 
 You call me to Your purpose 
 As angels understand 
 For Your glory, may You draw all men 
 As Your love and grace demand 
 (repeat chorus except last line) 
 Oh let me live in the glory 
 (repeat) 
 Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace 
 (repeat chorus except last line) 
 Oh let me live in the glory 
 (repeat) 
 Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace

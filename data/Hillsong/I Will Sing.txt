For You have set me free 
 You're all that I seek 
 Your love completes my life 
 You're the air that I breathe 
 And the Saviour of the world He's the reason I'm livin' 
 I will sing 
 And I will lift my voice to the one who has saved me 
 I will sing 
 I will sing 
 And I'll cry out for more saying Lord I need you 
 I will reach out 
 I'm reaching for more of you in my heart 
 And I will wait on You 
 In the stillness Lord 
 Listening for Your voice 
 Pure as gold refined 
 In Your presence Lord here where I belong

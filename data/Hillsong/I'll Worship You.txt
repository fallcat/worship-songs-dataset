I'll Worship You 
 In reaching out 
 To speak these words 
 Into Your heart 
 I'll worship You 
 My Lord my God 
 With faith declare 
 My love for You 
 I'll worship You 
 With all my heart 
 And all my strength 
 And in Your presence 
 Lord, my God, my King 
 I'll worship You 
 I'll worship You 
 So let these words 
 Reflect my heart 
 To make these songs 
 Be seen in me 
 And living life 
 As living truth 
 In all I am 
 And hope to be 
 I'll worship You (6X)

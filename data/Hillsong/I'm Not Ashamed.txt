When You found me 
 My whole world changed 
 I'm redeemed by Your life 
 Let the earth sing 
 You are freedom 
 Turn my darkness to light 
 You welcomed me in 
 With open arms 
 Into unending life 
 I'm not ashamed of the gospel Lord 
 Your power [and] Your love 
 You saved my soul 
 Now I'm alive in You 
 I live in the risen Son

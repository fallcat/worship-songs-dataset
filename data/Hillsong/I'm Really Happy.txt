I want to praise Jesus for all He's done for me 
 I want to shout real loud that Jesus is all I need 
 'Cause I gotta few words to say 
 And few things to do, 
 And a little jumping around, 
 'Cause I'm living for you 
 And I'm really happy You're in my life 
 I'm really happy You're in my heart 
 And I'm really happy 'cause Jesus You're all I need.

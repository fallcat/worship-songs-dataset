From heaven You can hear 
 I know You're drawing near 
 As I worship 
 Held within Your love 
 The wind and waves will come 
 But I will stay here 
 I lift my hands to Heaven 
 Here my heart surrendered 
 I tell my soul again 
 You are Lord of all 
 And though the seas are raging 
 You will speak and tame them 
 In You I find my rest 
 You are in control 
 Through valleys I will trust 
 Your spirit is enough, to keep me walking 
 You guide my every step 
 Speak life to me again 
 Lord I need You 
 Oh I need You 
 I lift my hands to heaven 
 Here my heart surrendered 
 I tell my soul again 
 You are Lord of all 
 And though the seas are raging 
 You will speak and tame them 
 In You I find my rest 
 You are in control 
 I will trust in only You 
 No one can add to Your perfection 
 You're the beginning and the end 
 More than I can comprehend 
 There is no one like You 
 No one 
 I will trust in only You 
 No one can add to Your perfection 
 You're the beginning and the end 
 More than I can comprehend 
 There is no one like You 
 No one 
 I will trust in only You 
 No one can add to Your perfection 
 You're the beginning and the end 
 More than I can comprehend 
 There is no one like You 
 Jesus 
 I lift my hands to heaven 
 Here my heart surrendered 
 I tell my soul again 
 You are Lord of all 
 And though the seas are raging 
 You will speak and tame them 
 In You I find my rest 
 You are in control 
 I lift my hands to heaven 
 Here my heart surrendered 
 I tell my soul again 
 You are Lord of all 
 And though the seas are raging 
 You will speak and tame them 
 In You I find my rest 
 You are in control 
 In You I find my rest 
 You are in control

A rising generation 
 Set apart for liberty 
 A royal loving people 
 Chosen to be mighty 
 Mighty in the land 
 A people who are hungry 
 Hungry for the bread of life 
 A people who are thirsty 
 Thirsty for the river, the river of joy 
 All across the nation 
 A cry is ringing out 
 The church of the king's 
 Breaking out 
 In freedom, in power, in healing 
 Salvation to the end of the earth

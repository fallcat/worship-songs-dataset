Overwhelmed but I won't break 
 Through the battle I will say 
 Your grace will be enough 
 Your grace will be enough 
 Under fire but we won't fall 
 We will never be alone 
 You'll always be enough 
 You'll always be enough 
 Now in God we trust 
 In His Name we hope 
 I know God will not be shaken 
 God is here with us 
 He's already won 
 I know God will not be shaken 
 We will follow where You go 
 We will trust through the unknown 
 I know You go before 
 I know You go before 
 Lead my heart now in Your ways 
 For we're carrying Your Name 
 Your promise never fails 
 Your promise never fails 
 You finish what You begun 
 Forever strong in Your love 
 Your Name is sure 
 And You will fight for us 
 Our hope forever secure 
 In You alone

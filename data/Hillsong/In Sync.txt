My life's filled with Your melody 
 And I'll cry of a life redeemed 
 My heart's tuned to Your mystery 
 In sync with You, in sync with You 
 My heart beats to Your rhythm now 
 My life song an eternal sound 
 For all You've done Lord I sing it loud 
 Forevermore, forevermore 
 In Your freedom here I stand 
 Letting go of all I am 
 Jesus take control 
 (I'm) Caught up in the middle of Your embrace 
 All I have surrendered Lord to Your Name 
 Jesus I'm forever singing Your praise 
 The skies echo Your love for us 
 You're at the raise from the empty cross 
 The earth shakes as Your truth resounds 
 That You're alive, You're with us now 
 In Your freedom here I stand 
 Letting go of all I am 
 Jesus take control 
 (I'm) Caught up in the middle of Your embrace 
 All I have surrendered Lord to Your Name 
 Jesus I'm forever singing Your praise 
 Let our hearts keep beating 
 To the sound of Heaven's drum 
 No we won't stand silent 
 We will sing like never before 
 In Your freedom here I stand 
 Letting go of all I am 
 Jesus take control 
 (I'm) Caught up in the middle of Your embrace 
 All I have surrendered Lord to Your Name 
 Jesus I'm forever singing Your praise

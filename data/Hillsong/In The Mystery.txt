In Your Name 
 There is hope when all seems lost 
 There is freedom in the power of the cross 
 Let the world see 
 In Your Name 
 There is truth where logic fails 
 Understanding that makes sense of our days 
 You Are worthy 
 Hear the song of all creation roar 
 We're crying out as one 
 To You our God 
 Now show us the way of Your love 
 And we will come running 
 All for Jesus' name 
 Your love displayed 
 We are alive in the mystery 
 All for sinners' gain 
 Your life You gave 
 We'll sing Your praise for eternity 
 In Your Name 
 There is mercy without end 
 Overtaking us now time and again 
 Let the world see 
 In Your Name 
 There is love that never fails 
 And the promise that Your Word will prevail 
 Hear the song of all creation roar 
 We're crying out as one 
 To You our God 
 Now show us the way of Your love 
 And we will come running 
 All for Jesus' name 
 Your love displayed 
 We are alive in the mystery 
 All for sinners' gain 
 Your life You gave 
 We'll sing Your praise for eternity 
 ... Hear us sing 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Great is Your Name 
 Great is Your Name

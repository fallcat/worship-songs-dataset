Skylines and crowded streets 
 Calling my attention 
 The limelight and empty dreams 
 Grieving my affections 
 But there is a perfect Voice 
 Waiting above the noise 
 Jesus my only choice 
 When all the lights are screaming 
 Then I 
 I get lost in Your eyes 
 And find the clarity to life 
 The world when all the colors rage 
 But I'm not gonna look away, no 
 I get lost in Your eyes 
 I've read all the glossy guides 
 To living in contentment 
 I've heard all the pretty lies 
 And all of them are vacant 
 But You are a love unique 
 My heart, my identity 
 Jesus you're all I need 
 And see the rest is nothing 
 Then I 
 I get lost in Your eyes 
 And find the clarity to life 
 The world when all the colors rage 
 But I'm not gonna look away, no 
 I get lost in Your eyes 
 Then I 
 I get lost in Your eyes 
 And find the clarity to life 
 The world when all the colors rage 
 But I'm not gonna look away, no 
 I get lost in Your eyes

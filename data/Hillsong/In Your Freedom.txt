I search for You God of strength 
 I bow to You In my brokenness 
 And no other king could have so humbly come 
 To save my soul and heal my heart 
 I have nothing more 
 Than all You offer me 
 There is nothing else 
 That's of worth to me 
 And I love You Lord You rescued me 
 You are all that I want You're all I need 
 I pray to You God of peace 
 I rest in You my cares released 
 In Your freedom I will live, In Your freedom I will live 
 I offer devotion, I offer devotion

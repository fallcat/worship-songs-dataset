I 
 (Ooh... ah...) 
 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you 
 And the waves, will not overcome you 
 Do not fear, for I have redeemed you 
 I have called you by name, you are Mine 
 II 
 For I am the Lord your God (girls repeat) 
 I am the Lord your God 
 (I am) the Holy One of Israel, your Savior (2x) 
 (GUYS) I am the Lord 
 (GIRLS) Do not fear 
 III 
 When you pass through the fire, you'll not be hurt 
 And the flames will not consume you 
 Do not fear, for I have redeemed you 
 I have called you by name, you are Mine 
 IV 
 (GUYS) You are the Lord 
 (GIRLS) I'll not fear 
 You are the Lord

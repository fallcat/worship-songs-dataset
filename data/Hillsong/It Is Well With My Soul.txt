When peace like a river 
 Attended my way 
 When sorrows like sea billows roll 
 Whatever my lot 
 You have taught me to say 
 It is well 
 It is well with my soul 
 But Lord it's for Thee 
 For Thy coming we wait 
 The sky not the grave is our goal 
 Oh trump of the angel 
 Oh voice of the Lord 
 Blessed hope 
 Blessed rest of my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well 
 It is well with my soul 
 You are the Rock 
 On which I stand 
 By Your grace it is well 
 My hope is sure 
 In Christ my Savior 
 It is well with my soul

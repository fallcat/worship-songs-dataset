Beauty for ashes, joy for my pain 
 You've given me wings to fly again 
 Strength for today, a dance for my sorrows 
 Because of you, because of you 
 Shades of grey turn to colour 
 Dark of night breaks to day 
 It's a new day, it's a new day 
 Shadows rise at the glory of the son 
 It's a new day, it's a new day 
 The past has gone and life has just begun 
 Hope for my future 
 My life's made brand new 
 Because of you, because of you 
 Chains of fear turn to freedom 
 Silence breaks into praise 
 It's a new day, it's a new day 
 It's a new day, since you came my way 
 Shades of grey turn to colour 
 Dark of night breaks to day 
 Chains of fear turn to freedom 
 Silence breaks into praise

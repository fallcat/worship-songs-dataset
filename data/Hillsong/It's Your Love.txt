Upon the hill on Calvary 
 He came from Heaven's throne 
 Our fallenness and mercy meet 
 Where blood and water flow 
 What grace divine what selflessness 
 That Christ would bear the weight 
 Our proof is scarred on hands that bled 
 That we were worth every nail 
 And all the praise and glory to God 
 We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah 
 For the King has carried the cross 
 He is risen from the grave 
 Beyond the tomb to holy skies 
 He rose in victory 
 And bridged for us the great divide 
 His life is our liberty 
 It's Your love 
 It's Your love 
 It's Your love 
 That has saved me 
 It's Your blood 
 It's Your blood 
 It's Your blood 
 That has cleaned me 
 Oh-Oh Whoa Whoa

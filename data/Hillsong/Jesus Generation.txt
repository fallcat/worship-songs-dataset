Let the Earth rejoice 
 See the risen King 
 On the clouds of praise 
 He's exalted forever 
 We will rise with Him 
 Son of righteousness 
 And the Earth will shake 
 In the glory of heaven 
 See the heavens open wide 
 And His glory like a flood 
 Fill the earth with salvation 
 See the nations take His hand 
 And in righteousness, they stand 
 This is Jesus generation 
 We will rise with Him 
 Son of righteousness 
 And the Earth will shake 
 In the glory of heaven 
 See the heavens open wide 
 And His glory like a flood 
 Fill the earth with salvation 
 See the nations take His hand 
 And in righteousness, they stand 
 This is Jesus generation 
 Glory, glory, glory, Emmanuel, God is with us 
 Glory, glory, glory, Emmanuel, God is with us

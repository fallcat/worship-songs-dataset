"I open my life to You 
 Lord, I want to be pure 
 Jesus, You're breath to my soul 
 You know what I think, what I feel. 
 Jesus, I adore You 
 To You my Saviour, I will sing 
 You know me through and through 
 You're closest to my heart than one could be 
 And Jesus, I adore You 
 I love You with the deepest of my soul 
 I rest inside your arms 
 And I trust You to lead me on"

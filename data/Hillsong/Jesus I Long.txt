I need direction in my life 
 Would You show me Your way 
 'Cause I know it is right 
 I need Your lovin' in my life 
 You're the only one whose love 
 Is better than life 
 Jesus I long to see Your face 
 Jesus I long 
 Jesus I long to see Your face 
 Jesus I long 
 I need Your favor in my life 
 Would You show me Your way 
 'Cause I know it is right 
 I need Your grace in my life 
 You're the only one whose love 
 Is better than life

Hope be my anthem 
 Lord when the world has fallen quiet 
 You stand beside me 
 Give me a song in the night 
 Jesus I need You 
 Every moment I need You 
 Hear now this grace bought heart sing out 
 Your praise forever 
 Beauty for ashes 
 You find the weak and contrite heart 
 Shoulder its burdens 
 And carry it into the light 
 Remember love 
 Remember mercy 
 Christ before me 
 Christ behind me 
 Your loving kindness 
 Has never failed me 
 Christ before me 
 Christ behind me

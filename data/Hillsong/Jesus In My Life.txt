When things have got me down and no is around 
 I got Jesus, I got Jesus 
 When life's a mystery and peace is what I need 
 I got Jesus, I got Jesus 
 Everybody, everywhere 
 C'mon, C'mon, let me hear you sing 
 Everything Ok and everything's all right 
 'Cause I got Jesus in my life 
 Rap: 
 If you've got Jesus in your heart come on and let me hear you say Whoa 
 If you've got Jesus in your life come on and let me hear you say Wo Oh 
 If you've got Jesus in your school come on and let me hear you say Wo Oh Oh 
 If you've got Jesus in your heart come on and let me hear you scream

Hallelujah, Jesus is alive 
 Death has lost its victory 
 And the grave has been denied 
 And Jesus lives forever 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He's the alpha and omega 
 The first and last is He 
 The curse of sin is broken 
 And we have perfect liberty 
 The lamb of God has risen 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 Hallelujah, Jesus is alive 
 Death has lost its victory 
 And the grave has been denied 
 Jesus lives forever 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He's the alpha and omega 
 The first and last is He 
 The curse of sin is broken 
 And we have perfect liberty 
 The lamb of God has risen 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 Hallelujah, Jesus is alive 
 Death has lost its victory 
 And the grave has been denied 
 Jesus lives forever 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He's the alpha and omega 
 The first and last is He 
 The curse of sin is broken 
 We have perfect liberty 
 The lamb of God has risen 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 Hallelujah, Jesus is alive 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 Yes, He's alive

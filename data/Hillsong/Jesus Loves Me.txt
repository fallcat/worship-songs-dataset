I will never be the same 
 I have found the love 
 No heart could frame 
 I will never be alone 
 I have found a peace 
 That stills my soul 
 Oh I believe 
 The King of heaven 
 Died for me 
 Jesus loves me 
 Jesus loves me 
 And this I Know 
 Jesus loves me 
 Jesus loves me 
 I'll forever sing Your song 
 Blessed be the Lord 
 Almighty God 
 And I will never be so moved 
 Knowing I am held 
 And raised with You 
 If I speak in tongues of angels 
 Of this world 
 If understand 
 Your mystery 
 But have not love 
 What have I got?

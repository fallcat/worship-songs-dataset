There's a light in the darkness that shines 
 Giving hope to all the world 
 Hope to all the world 
 And there's a door that's been opened to all 
 Into a new and living way 
 A new and living way 
 Praise the name of Jesus 
 Perfect Redeemer, Star of the Morning 
 Yesterday, today and forever 
 Jesus the Same... 
 There's a fire that burns in our hearts 
 To see the lost return 
 To the Father 
 And it's a passion that's not of our own 
 We have seen it in the Son 
 In the face of the Son 
 Wonderful Counsillor 
 Mighty God, Eternal Father 
 Prince of Peace

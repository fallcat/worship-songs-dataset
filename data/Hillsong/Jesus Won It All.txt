Beauty for ashes 
 Life evermore 
 Peace beyond measure 
 Jesus won it all 
 Saved out of darkness 
 Cleansed by His blood 
 Into His Kingdom 
 By the power of God 
 He has won it, my salvation 
 My forgiveness, at the cross 
 He is healing, He's redemption 
 For whoever would come 
 He has won, that's the cross 
 All can take freely 
 Water of life 
 Let all who thirst, come 
 Worship Jesus Christ 
 He has won it, my salvation 
 My forgiveness, at the cross 
 He is healing, He's redemption 
 For whoever would come 
 He has won, that's the cross 
 He has won it, my salvation 
 My forgiveness, at the cross 
 He is healing, He's redemption 
 For whoever would come 
 He has won, that's the cross 
 For in Him is the life 
 That destroyed sin and death 
 And He broke every chain 
 For the bound and oppressed 
 For the bound and oppressed 
 He's alive, He's alive 
 He has won it, my salvation 
 My forgiveness, at the cross 
 He is healing, He's redemption 
 For whoever would come 
 He has won, that's the cross 
 He has won it, my salvation 
 My forgiveness, at the cross 
 He is healing, He's redemption 
 For whoever would come 
 He has won, that's the cross 
 Jesus won it all

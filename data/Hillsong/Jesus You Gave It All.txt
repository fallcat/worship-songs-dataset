Lord, I lift my voice in praise to You 
 For the love You placed inside of me 
 Lord, I give my life, my heart and soul to You alone 
 And with every breath that comes from me 
 Will flow Your mercy and Your grace 
 Proclaiming love and liberty for all who have an ear to hear 
 And Your love stirs faith and hope in me 
 And Your grace brings power to set this sinner free 
 And Your blood pours joy into my life 
 Jesus, You gave it all for me

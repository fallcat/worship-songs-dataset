Jesus, Jesus, one touch of Your hand 
 I am healed and I am whole. 
 Jesus, Jesus, one glimpse of Your face 
 Brings fire to my soul. 
 And Jesus, I come, 
 Beholding Your face 
 I am changed from glory to glory. 
 And now I see, and now I know, 
 One touch of Your life 
 Brings glory to my soul. 
 Jesus, Jesus, from darkness to light 
 My life overflows. 
 Jesus, Jesus, Your mercy and grace 
 Like a river flowing down 
 And Jesus, I come, 
 Beholding Your face 
 I am changed from glory to glory. 
 And now I see, and now I know, 
 One touch of Your life 
 Brings glory to my soul. 
 And now I see, and now I know, 
 One touch of Your life 
 Brings glory to my soul. 
 And now I see, and now I know, 
 One touch of your life 
 Brings glory to my soul. 
 And now I see, and now I know, 
 One touch of Your life, 
 Brings glory to my soul. 
 Jesus, Jesus. 
 Jesus, Jesus. 
 Jesus, Jesus. 
 Jesus, Jesus.

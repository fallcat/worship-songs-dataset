Jesus you're all we need 
 If your take away everything, Lord I still have you 
 When my friends walked away, Lord I ran to you. (Lord I ran) 
 Your mercy endureth, forever and today 
 Cause Lord your real and I can feel, that your ganna make a way 
 Cause now I know, what real love is 
 Ever since I saw face, herd your voice 
 Lord, your all I'm living for 
 Ever since I saw face, herd your voice

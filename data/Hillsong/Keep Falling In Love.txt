I am found in Your embrace 
 Covered by Your love 
 You're my deepest dream I know 
 Your love so strong, spirit come 
 You lift me up to heaven's door 
 You restored my soul 
 I come here without Your touch 
 I need You so much, need You more 
 You're my rock and my redeemer 
 The rock on which I stand 
 I keep falling in love with You Lord 
 Every beat of my heart, breath that I take 
 Through the seasons that change, Your love remains 
 My hiding place, my home falling in love

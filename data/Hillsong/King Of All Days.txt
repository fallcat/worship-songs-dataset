In Your surrender 
 As You laid down Your life 
 You took up a sinner's cross 
 And Your life rescued mine 
 In His redemption 
 Love and mercy displayed 
 You lifted my eyes to see 
 That Your truth never fails 
 Lord of the heavens, King of all days 
 Without You my world slips away 
 Redeemed by Your mercy, consumed by Your grace 
 Now I live for You 
 I'm found in the arms of love 
 Your love it has saved my soul 
 I'll run to Your arms of love 
 Your light's gonna lead me home 
 Glorious Saviour 
 In Your light I am free 
 The things of this world will fade 
 Still You are all that I need 
 Lord of the heavens, King of all days 
 Without You my world slips away 
 Redeemed by Your mercy, consumed by Your grace 
 Now I live for You 
 I'm found in the arms of love 
 Your love it has saved my soul 
 I'll run to Your arms of love 
 Your light's gonna lead me home 
 I'm found in the arms of love 
 Your love it has saved my soul 
 I'll run to Your arms of love 
 Your light's gonna lead me home 
 And at Your cross I lay my burdens 
 At Your feet where Your love covers 
 All I've done, now I'll walk with You Lord 
 At Your cross I lay my burdens 
 At Your feet where Your love covers 
 All I've done, now I'll walk with You Lord 
 Now I'll walk with You Lord 
 Now I'll walk with You Lord 
 Now I'll walk with You Lord 
 Now I'll walk with You Lord 
 I'm found in the arms of love 
 For Your love it has saved my soul 
 I'll run to Your arms of love 
 Your light's gonna lead me home 
 I'm found in the arms of love 
 For Your love it has saved my soul 
 I'll run to Your arms of love 
 Your light's gonna lead me home

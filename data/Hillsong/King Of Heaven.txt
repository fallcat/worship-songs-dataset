You tore the night apart 
 And ripped the silent skies in half 
 Your glory breaking through the dark 
 And here our worlds collide 
 Divinity in man confined 
 This great design drawn out for me 
 Emmanuel 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel 
 Hallelujah 
 You hold the ends of time 
 Yet placed Yourself here into mine 
 My life is now forever changed 
 Our eyes be lifted up 
 Our great eternal hope arise 
 This great design drawn out for me 
 Emmanuel 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel 
 Hallelujah 
 Emmanuel 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel 
 Hallelujah 
 In our silence 
 Heaven whispered out 
 In our darkness 
 Glory pierced the night 
 We were broken 
 But now we're lifted up 
 King of heaven 
 God is here with us 
 Hallelujah 
 Angels crying aloud 
 Singing holy 
 All the praise resound 
 King of Heaven 
 On the Earth be found 
 King of Heaven 
 On the Earth be found 
 Emmanuel 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel 
 Hallelujah 
 Emmanuel 
 God with us 
 Emmanuel 
 Hallelujah

(Words and music Geoff Bullock) 
 King of Kings 
 Lord of Lords 
 Jesus the Son of God is glorified 
 Prince of Peace 
 Holy One 
 Jesus the Son of God is glorified 
 He is risen to the Father's right hand 
 Now seated on the throne 
 All authority 
 In Heaven and on earth 
 Is given to His Name 
 The Name of the Lord 
 He's exalted 'bove the heavens and the earth 
 And every knee shall bow 
 Every tongue confess that 
 Jesus Christ is Lord 
 The Name above all names 
 The Name of the Lord

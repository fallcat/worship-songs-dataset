You know that, 
 I love You, 
 You know that, 
 I want to know You so much more, 
 More than I have before 
 These words are, 
 From my heart, 
 These words are, 
 Not made up, 
 I will live for You, 
 I am devoted to You, 
 King of Majesty 
 I have one desire 
 Just to be with You my Lord, 
 Just to be with You my Lord, 
 Jesus You are the Saviour of my soul 
 And forever and ever I'll give my praises to You, 
 Jesus You are the Saviour of my soul 
 And forever and ever I'll give my praises to You, 
 Jesus You are the Saviour of my soul (echo) 
 And forever and ever I'll give my praises to You (echo)

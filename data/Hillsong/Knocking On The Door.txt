We will give ourselves no rest 
 Till Your kingdom comes on Earth 
 We've positioned watchmen on the walls 
 Now our prayers will flow like tears 
 Till You've shared Your heart with us 
 God of heaven, on our knees we fall 
 Come down in power 
 Reveal Yourself again 
 Come hear our cries 
 The tears that plead for rain 
 We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven 
 We're crying, crying for this generation 
 We're praying for Your Word to bear fruit 
 In all of the earth 
 We're watching, watching on the walls to see You 
 We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough 
 We're praying for Your Word to bear fruit 
 In all of the earth, in all of the earth

You hold it all at once 
 The earth and all within 
 You look with eyes of love 
 To the sons of man 
 That I am known by You 
 Compels my heart to sing 
 I live to know You more 
 I live to know You more 
 I live to know You more 
 For me to live is Christ 
 To know You is my life 
 The storms will come and go 
 There's laughter and there's pain 
 Your kindness leads me on 
 To the light again 
 So I live and breathe 
 And find myself in You 
 I live to know You 
 I live to know You 
 I live to know You more 
 I count it all but loss 
 Compared to knowing You 
 I give my life away 
 To know You any day

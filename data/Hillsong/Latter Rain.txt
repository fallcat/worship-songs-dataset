This is the hour, the time has come 
 His Spirit calls, He calls us on 
 To make this land, holy for the Lord 
 This is the time to seize the day 
 We rise in faith, the promise comes 
 To make this land, holy to the Lord 
 These are the days of the latter rain 
 Days of power, days of grace 
 This is the time the fire will fall 
 To make this land holy 
 To make this land holy to the Lord 
 This is the time, our finest hour 
 Of battles fought and victories won 
 To make this land holy to the Lord 
 And from this time our future calls 
 The promise sure, the rain will fall 
 We see this land holy to the Lord

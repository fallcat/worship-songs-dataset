The whole earth 
 Overflowing 
 With Your Power 
 And Your Glory 
 There is no one like You God 
 There is no one like You God 
 Mountains bow 
 Nations tremble 
 At Your feet we cry Holy 
 There is no one like You God 
 There is no one like You God 
 Let creation sing of the risen King 
 Let the universe resound 
 With a shout of love 
 We will give to You 
 All the highest praise 
 Let Your light 
 Shine upon us 
 Let Your light 
 Shine upon us 
 For the Glory of Your name 
 Will be over all the earth 
 Forever 
 Forever I'll sing 
 Forever 
 Forever I'll sing

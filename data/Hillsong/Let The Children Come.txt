I believe You made all that I can see 
 So everything I want is You alive in me 
 Though I may be young 
 You said 'Let the children come'. 
 So I will sing 
 I'm not too small to know You Jesus as my Lord 
 Oh I will sing, I will for You, only for You 
 Even if my eyes cannot see You here 
 I believe You are, I know You're always near

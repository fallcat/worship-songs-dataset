Let the whole world sing Your praise 
 Let creation bow down before You 
 You've got my whole world in Your hands 
 Let my heart sing a song of freedom 
 My heart's abandoned to Your name 
 Light of the whole world livin' in me 
 Let the nations resound for You, Lord 
 To see salvation here on the earth, here on the earth 
 You are the God of all my dreams 
 I'll follow You and everything 
 I have is Your, it's Yours 
 I'm living life for You and my world will never be the same 
 I'm living for you, God 
 So all will see Your kingdom come 
 And nothing in this world is gonna stop now 
 It won't hold me down

There's no darkness in Your eyes 
 There's no question in Your mind 
 God Almighty 
 God of mercy 
 There's no hiding from Your face 
 There's no striving in Your grace 
 God of mercy 
 God Almighty 
 Let there be light 
 Open the eyes of the blind 
 Purify our hearts in Your fire 
 Breathe in us we pray 
 Jesus have Your way 
 There's no borders in Your love 
 No division in Your heart 
 God of heaven 
 God of freedom 
 There's no taking back the cross 
 No regret in what it cost 
 God of freedom 
 God of heaven 
 Let there be light 
 Open the eyes of the blind 
 Purify our hearts in Your fire 
 Breathe in us we pray 
 Let there be light 
 Open our eyes to Your heart 
 Desperate just to know who You are 
 Shine in us we pray 
 Jesus have Your way 
 Good news embracing the poor 
 Comfort for all those who mourn 
 For the broken hearted 
 We sing louder 
 Release from prison and shame 
 Oppression turning to praise 
 For every captive 
 Sing louder 
 Restoring sight to the blind 
 Breaking the curse of the night 
 For all in darkness 
 Sing louder 
 Proclaiming freedom for all 
 This is the day of the Lord 
 Beauty for ashes 
 Let there be light 
 Open the eyes of the blind 
 Purify our hearts in Your fire 
 Breathe in us we pray 
 Let there be light 
 Open our eyes to Your heart 
 Desperate just to know who You are 
 Shine in us we pray 
 Jesus have Your way 
 Let the light that shines above 
 Become the light that shines in us 
 There's no darkness in Your way 
 So have Your way 
 Lord have Your way

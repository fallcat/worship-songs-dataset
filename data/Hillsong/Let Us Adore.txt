The heavens declare 
 The glory of God 
 And all of the world 
 Will join the praise 
 His wonders proclaim 
 The oceans and skies 
 Lift up their voice 
 And all all He has made 
 Will rise to bless 
 The King of all kings. 
 Let us adore Him 
 Let us adore Him 
 Jeus Christ is the Lord 
 Come and behold Him 
 Bow down before Him 
 Jesus Christ is the Lord 
 Eternity's King 
 Is coming again 
 Though all of the earth 
 Will fade away 
 His truth will remain 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 You are worthy of all praise

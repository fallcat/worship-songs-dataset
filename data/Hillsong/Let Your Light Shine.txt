Crep, creep, creep in the dark fear comes to blow out all your lights. 
 It doesn't want you telling everybody that Jesus rules, all right! 
 Let your light shine Whoa 
 Let your light shine Whoa 
 Let Your light shine and let Jesus shine through you 
 Giant fears are really small when all you see is God 
 Don't be afraid to stand up tall and give a great big shout 
 I'm not scared, I'm gonna let my light shine 
 You're not scared, you're gonna let your light shine 
 We're not scared, we're gonna let our light shine 
 'Cause Jesus is Lord, and He's gonna let His light shine

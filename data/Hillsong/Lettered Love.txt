Your Word shows 
 How much You have loved me 
 Sending Love to find me 
 Reaching to my heart 
 Now I see 
 Lettered love has found me 
 Littered red with mercy 
 Written in Your scars Jesus 
 So have this broken heart 
 And show me what Love paid for 
 Oh Lord let my heart beat with 
 Yours This lettered love 
 Is shaping my story 
 All for the praise of Your Name 
 All for the fame of Your glory 
 Jesus be all that I seek 
 Your presence is all that I need 
 Like the sun and moon 
 Like the night and noon 
 Your Word is light to me 
 And I'll praise You 
 Splitting death and life 
 Like the earth and sky 
 Your Word is light in me 
 And I'll praise You 
 Lord have this broken heart 
 For this broken heart is paid for 
 And shaped by the truth of Your Word

 Jesus be all that I seek 
 Your presence is all that I need

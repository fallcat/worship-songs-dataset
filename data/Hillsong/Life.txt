Your life 
 Your life 
 Your life 
 In mine 
 Your thoughts 
 Your ways 
 Your mystery 
 Too deep for words 
 My spirit burns to worship You 
 Your life 
 Your life 
 Your life 
 In mine 
 Your heart 
 Your plans 
 Your will for me 
 There's nothing else my soul desires 
 Than more of You 
 Your life 
 Your life 
 Your life 
 In mine 
 Take my heart, take my soul 
 Take my mind and I will 
 Give my thoughts, give my all 
 Give my life to follow You 
 Take my hands, take my breath 
 Take my dreams and I will 
 Lift my eyes, lift my faith 
 Lift my voice and worship You 
 Take my heart, take my soul 
 Take my mind and I will 
 Give my thoughts, give my all 
 Give my life to follow You 
 Take my hands, take my breath 
 Take my dreams and I will 
 Lift my eyes, lift my faith 
 Lift my voice and worship You 
 My God, my closest friend 
 I need Your love more than my lungs 
 Need oxygen 
 Take my heart, take my soul 
 Take my mind and I will 
 Give my thoughts, give my all 
 Give my life to follow You 
 Take my hands, take my breath 
 Take my dreams and I will 
 Lift my eyes, lift my faith 
 Lift my voice and worship You

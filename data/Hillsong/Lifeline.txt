You took me from the wayside 
 Called me Your own 
 Throwing me a lifeline 
 You carried me home 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 Over the horizon 
 Is where I look beyond 
 You're the silver lining 
 Breaking through the storm 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 A castaway lost in the violent sea 
 Drifting away till You rescued me 
 You set my feet on solid ground 
 When I lost my grip love held on tight 
 Even my worst didn't change Your mind 
 My guilt and shame lost in Your grace 
 You took me from the wayside 
 Called me Your own 
 Throwing me a lifeline 
 You carried me home 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 Over the horizon 
 Is where I look beyond 
 You're the silver lining 
 Breaking through the storm 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 Runaway heart in the distant land 
 I wandered so far still to find You there 
 There's no escaping Your embrace 
 With my hope locked in and my future sure 
 My life has a cause worth fighting for 
 My soul exists to know Your Name 
 You took me from the wayside 
 Called me Your own 
 Throwing me a lifeline 
 You carried me home 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 Over the horizon 
 Is where I look beyond 
 You're the silver lining 
 Breaking through the storm 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 And oh 
 You are my hope 
 Jesus forever 
 You've forgiven my failures 
 You are my hope 
 You never let go 
 Jesus forever 
 You've forgiven my failures 
 You are my hope 
 You took me from the wayside 
 Called me Your own 
 Throwing me a lifeline 
 You carried me home 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 Over the horizon 
 Is where I look beyond 
 You're the silver lining 
 Breaking through the storm 
 Jesus You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 You're all I want 
 And oh 
 You are my hope 
 Jesus forever 
 You've forgiven my failures 
 You are my hope 
 You never let go 
 Jesus forever 
 You've forgiven my failures 
 You are my hope 
 You never let go 
 Jesus forever 
 You've forgiven my failures 
 You are my hope 
 You never let go 
 Jesus forever 
 You've forgiven my failures

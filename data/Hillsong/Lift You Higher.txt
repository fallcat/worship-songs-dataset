You came to save the world 
 To rescue me 
 To rescue me 
 You came to give us hope 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You set our hearts on fire 
 It burns in me 
 It burns in me 
 Now You awaken us 
 For all to see 
 For all to see 
 Because Your love has set us free 
 Because Your love will never leave 
 Because You live and died for me 
 I live for You alone 
 We lift You higher 
 Our God 
 Your Name be lifted higher in ev'rything 
 Oh oh oh 
 We lift You up

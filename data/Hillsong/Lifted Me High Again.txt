Where the spirit is there is liberty 
 Fullness of joy 
 With a heart of praise, I will lift my voice 
 In the holy place 
 Your love has lifted me up again 
 Now I'm free to live 
 Your grace has lifted me high again 
 You are awesome in this place O Lord 
 We exalt Your name 
 For hope You set inside of me 
 I will ever sing 
 There's no higher love that I could find 
 For this joy 
 I will thank You 
 I will thank You

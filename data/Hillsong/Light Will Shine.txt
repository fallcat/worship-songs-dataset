Salvation rise 
 As we sing of Your freedom 
 We leave the past behind 
 As we look to Your kingdom 
 You bridge the great divide 
 Between our hearts and Your glory 
 Our shame dissolved 
 In the depths of Your mercy 
 We are devoted 
 We are devoted to You 
 Your light will shine in the darkness 
 Your light will shine in the dark, in the dark 
 Woah, we are Yours 
 We fill the open skies 
 With the sound of Your praises 
 Our future lies 
 In the hope of our Savior 
 We are devoted 
 We are devoted to You 
 Your light will shine in the darkness 
 Your light will shine in the dark, in the dark 
 Woah, we are Yours 
 Your light will shine in the darkness 
 Your light will shine in the dark, in the dark 
 Woah, we are Yours 
 It's Your love, Your love 
 It's Your love, Your love 
 Your light will shine in the darkness 
 Your light will shine in the dark, in the dark 
 Woah, we are Yours 
 Your light will shine in the darkness 
 Your light will shine in the dark, in the dark 
 Woah, we are Yours 
 It's Your love, Your love 
 It's Your love, Your love

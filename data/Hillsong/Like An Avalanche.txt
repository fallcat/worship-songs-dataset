Beautiful God 
 Laying Your majesty aside 
 You reached out in love to show me life 
 Lifted from darkness into light 
 Oh 
 King for a slave 
 Trading Your righteousness for shame 
 Despite all my pride and foolish ways 
 Caught in Your infinite embrace 
 Oh 
 And I find myself here on my knees again 
 Caught up in grace like an avalanche 
 Nothing compares to this love love love 
 Burning in my heart 
 Saviour and Friend 
 Breathing Your life into my heart 
 Your word is the lamp unto my path 
 Forever I'm humbled by Your love 
 Oh 
 Take my life 
 Take all that I am 
 With all that I am I will love You 
 Take my heart 
 Take all that I have 
 Jesus how I adore You 
 And I find myself here on my knees again 
 Caught up in grace like an avalanche 
 Nothing compare to this love love love

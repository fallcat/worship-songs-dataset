May my prayer like incense rise before You 
 The lifting of my hands as sacrifice 
 Oh Lord Jesus turn Your eyes upon me 
 For I know there is mercy in Your sight 
 Your statutes are my heritage forever 
 My heart is set on keeping Your decrees 
 Please still my anxious urge toward rebellion 
 Let Love keep my will upon its knees 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 To all creation I can see a limit 
 But Your commands are boundless and have none 
 So Your Word is my joy and meditation 
 From the rising to the setting of the sun 
 All Your ways are loving and are faithful 
 The road is narrow but Your burden light 
 Because You gladly lean to lead the humble 
 I shall gladly kneel to leave my pride 
 (Selah) 
 To all creation I can see a limit 
 But Your commands are boundless and have none 
 So Your Word is my joy and meditation 
 From the rising to the setting of the sun 
 I will seek You in the morning 
 I will learn to walk in Your ways 
 And step by step You'll lead me 
 And I will follow You all of my days

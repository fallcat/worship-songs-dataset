Cover me 
 In stillness you are welcome here 
 Comfort me 
 And teach me Lord to know Your peace 
 I look to the cross 
 Lord, let me see Your love anew 
 There I find peace 
 There I find peace again 
 Draw me near into Your arms 
 The strength I know left my soul 
 To rest in You, my only hope 
 I look to the cross 
 Lord, let me see Your love anew 
 'Cause there I find peace 
 There I find peace again 
 I look to the cross 
 Lord, let me see Your love anew 
 'Cause there I find peace 
 There I find peace again 
 Oh, I found peace again 
 In You I found, I found peace again 
 'Cause the Lord, my light and my salvation 
 In whom then I shall be afraid 
 I'll never be the same 
 The Lord, my light and my salvation 
 In whom then I shall be afraid 
 I'll never be the same again 
 In You I find peace again 
 I look to the cross 
 Lord, let me see Your love anew 
 There I find peace 
 There I find peace again in You 
 I look to the cross 
 Lord, let me see Your love anew 
 'Cause there I find peace 
 There I find peace again

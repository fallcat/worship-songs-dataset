Oh we look to the Son 
 Set our eyes on our Saviour 
 See the image of love 
 Sing His praises forever 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Salvation 
 Tearing through the dead of night 
 See the kingdom burst into colour 
 At the speed of light 
 Freedom 
 Shaking up the atmosphere 
 See the shadows fade into nothing 
 As the day appears 
 Beyond the skies above 
 Love reaching out for us 
 The Everlasting One 
 Jesus our God 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Set our eyes on our Saviour 
 See the image of love 
 Sing His praises forever 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Creation 
 Waking up to Kingdom come 
 See the hope of Heaven 
 Shining like the rising sun 
 Now forever 
 Lifted up from death to life 
 There's no fear in love 
 And no darkness in His endless light 
 Beyond the skies above 
 Love reaching out for us 
 The Everlasting One 
 Jesus our God 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Set our eyes on our Saviour 
 See the image of love 
 Sing His praises forever 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Beyond the skies above 
 Love reaching out for us 
 The Everlasting One 
 Jesus our God 
 Beyond the skies above 
 Love reaching out for us 
 The Everlasting One 
 Jesus our God 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Set our eyes on our Saviour 
 See the image of love 
 Sing His praises forever 
 Oh we look to the Son 
 Oh we look to the Son

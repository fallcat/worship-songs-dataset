So I look to You 
 So I look to You 
 No one else will do 
 No one else will do 
 I know You love 
 And I know You died for me 
 And I know You care 
 And I know You care 
 And I know You live again 
 Your life for all my sin 
 And now I stand here in 
 In Your grace again 
 When I look into the sky above 
 Wonder how my life has changed 
 Wonder how Your love, it came to me 
 When I look into the sky above 
 And all my fears, so far away 
 And all I feel is Heaven calling me 
 So I look to You 
 So I look to You 
 No one else will do 
 No one else will do 
 I know You love 
 And I know You died for me 
 And I know You care 
 And I know You care 
 And I know You live again 
 Your life for all my sin 
 And now I stand here in 
 In Your grace again 
 When I look into the sky above 
 Wonder how my life has changed 
 Wonder how Your love, it came to me 
 When I look into the sky above 
 And all my fears, so far away 
 And all I feel is Heaven calling me 
 So I look to You 
 So I look to You 
 No one else will do 
 No one else will do 
 So I look to You 
 So I look to You 
 No one else will do 
 No one else will do 
 When I look into the sky above 
 Wonder how my life has changed 
 Wonder how Your love, it came to me 
 When I look into the sky above 
 And all my fears, so far away 
 And all I feel is Heaven calling me 
 So I look to You 
 So I look to You 
 No one else will do 
 No one else will do 
 So I look to You 
 So I look to You 
 No one else will do 
 No one else will do 
 So I look to You 
 So I look to You 
 No one else will do

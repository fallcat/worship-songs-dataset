Lord, I give myself, I trust in You, 
 Mighty God, My Saviour. 
 And Your mercy and love overflows 
 And my soul rejoices. 
 Lord, show me Your ways, guide my steps, 
 Lead me to You righteousness. 
 And the light of Your love 
 Takes my fear away 
 'Cause I know You walk before me. 
 Oh, my Shepherd, 
 You let me rest in Your arms, 
 You comfort me. 
 And everywhere that I go 
 I'm not alone, Mighty God, 
 I know, You're with me. 
 And everywhere that I go 
 I'm not alone, Mighty God, 
 I know You're with me.

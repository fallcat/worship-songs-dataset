Beholding Your beauty 
 Is all that I long for 
 To worship You Jesus 
 Is my sole desire 
 For this very heart 
 You have shaped for Your pleasure 
 Purposed to lift Your Name higher 
 Here in surrender 
 In pure adoration 
 I enter Your courts 
 With an offering of praise 
 I am Your servant 
 Come to bring You glory 
 As is fit for the work of Your hands 
 Now unto the Lamb 
 Who sits on the throne 
 Be glory and honour and praise 
 All of creation resounds with the song 
 Worship and praise Him 
 The Lord of lords 
 Spirit now living 
 And dwelling within me 
 Keep my eyes fixed 
 Ever on Jesus' face 
 Let not the things of this world 
 Ever sway me 
 I'll run 'til I finish the race 
 Now unto the Lamb 
 Who sits on the throne 
 Be glory and honour and praise 
 All of eternity echoes the song 
 Worship and praise Him 
 The Lord of lords 
 Holy Lord 
 You are holy 
 Jesus Christ 
 Is the Lord 
 Now unto the Lamb 
 Who sits on the throne 
 Be glory and honour and praise 
 Call all the saints to join in the song 
 Worship and praise Him 
 The Lord of lords

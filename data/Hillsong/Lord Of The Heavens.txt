Lord of the Heavens and the earth 
 My Savior, Redeemer, risen Lord 
 All honor, glory, power, and strength 
 To Him upon the throne 
 Holy, holy, You are worthy 
 Praises to the Son of God 
 Jesus, You alone are worthy 
 Crowned in righteousness and peace 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah 
 Praises to the great I am 
 Hosanna, join with angels singing 
 Worthy is the Lamb of God

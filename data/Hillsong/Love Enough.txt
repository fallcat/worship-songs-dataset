Your love's enough to see the broken hearts 
 Gain a brand new start with a brand new heart 
 As the faithful hope in things unseen 
 You're enough to see all the things they dream 
 Come to life 
 We're living in the Saviour today 
 And this day is what we have now 
 In this moment we have chosen to praise 
 And it's changing how we live now 
 Your love it broke my fall 
 It's more than enough and I need it 
 'Cause I've never known better 
 And I'll never know better 
 This love will see me soar 
 It's more than enough and I need it 
 'Cause I've never known better 
 And I'll never know better 
 Your love's enough to see the humbled man 
 Find the cause of Christ 
 With his outstretched hands 
 As the cripple grabs his mat to walk 
 You're enough to save him from the pain he bore 
 My Saviour 
 You'll never let me go 
 My life is now secure 
 My Saviour 
 You'll never let me go 
 And in Your hands my future's brighter

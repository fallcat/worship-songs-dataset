We found love that never runs dry 
 From the depths 
 To the sky 
 Eyes fixed on the One who knows no end 
 You stand strong for all of time 
 In the joy 
 In the trial 
 You are the Beginning and the End 
 Your love goes on 
 Your love goes on 
 Ever our heart will seek 
 Jesus in everything 
 From sky to ocean deep 
 Your love goes on 
 Through every rise and fall 
 We are forever Yours 
 One thing we know is sure 
 Your love goes on and on and on 
 From dawn break into the night 
 You're here with us 
 You're on our side 
 Your arms are forever open wide 
 You stand strong for all of time 
 In the joy 
 In the trial 
 You are the Beginning and the End 
 Your love goes on

 Ever our heart will seek 
 Jesus in everything 
 From sky to ocean deep 
 Your love goes on 
 Through every rise and fall 
 We are forever Yours 
 One thing we know is sure 
 Your love goes on and on and on

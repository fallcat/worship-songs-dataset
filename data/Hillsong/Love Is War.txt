In Your justice and Your mercy 
 Heaven walked the broken road 
 Here to fight this sinner's battle 
 Here to make my fall Your own 
 Turn my eyes to see Your face 
 As all my fears surrender 
 Hold my heart within this grace 
 Where burden turns to wonder 
 I will fight to follow 
 I will fight for love 
 Throw my life forever 
 To the triumph of the Son 
 Let Your love be my companion 
 In the war against my pride 
 Long to break all vain obsession 
 Till You're all that I desire 
 Turn my eyes to see Your face 
 As all my fears surrender 
 Hold my heart within this grace 
 Where burden turns to wonder 
 I will fight to follow 
 I will fight for love 
 Throw my life forever 
 To the triumph of the Son 
 And I know Your love has won it all 
 You took the fall 
 To embrace my sorrows 
 I know You took the fight 
 You came and died but the grave was borrowed 
 I know You stood again 
 So I can stand with a life to follow 
 In the light of Your name 
 Turn my eyes to see Your face 
 As all my fears surrender 
 Hold my heart within this grace 
 Where burden turns to wonder 
 I will fight to follow 
 I will fight for love 
 Throw my life forever 
 To the triumph of the Son 
 And I know Your love has won it all 
 You took the fall 
 To embrace my sorrows 
 I know You took the fight 
 You came and died but the grave was borrowed 
 I know You stood again 
 So I can stand with a life to follow 
 In the light of Your name

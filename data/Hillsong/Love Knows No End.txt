I lift my eyes to see Your face 
 I know my help is in Your Name 
 In everything 
 Held by hands 
 Of mercy 
 I will run and not grow weary 
 I will rise in God my strength 
 My heart will trust 
 For all my hope 
 Is Christ alone 
 Now my soul sings 
 Your love it knows no end 
 Your love it knows no end 
 Your love it knows no end 
 I will love for You have loved 
 I will forgive as You forgive 
 Your love prevails 
 You fill my life 
 With hope again 
 You reign forever 
 You reign forever 
 You are the light unto this world

I am desperate for Your touch 
 A glimpse of heaven 
 For the glory of Your Son. 
 In a moment You can 
 Turn a life around 
 Forever to be found in You. 
 I am reaching out to find 
 There's nothing greater than 
 Your love that holds my life. 
 Your grace and mercy that 
 Have saved me by Your blood, 
 And swept away my shame Oh Lord. 
 Your love is like fire 
 That burns for all to see. 
 My only desire 
 To worship at Your feet. 
 So let this fire 
 Consume my life. 
 Let Your love take me deeper 
 Draw me closer to where You are, 
 'Cause all I want is more of You. 
 And I'm surrender to Your love 
 Forever humbled by the 
 Message of the cross. 
 I stand abandoned in 
 Your presence and Your embrace, 
 And I'll never be the same Oh God. 
 Your love is like fire, 
 That burns for all to see. 
 My only desire, 
 To worship at Your feet. 
 So let this fire 
 Consume my life. 
 Let Your love take me deeper, 
 Draw me closer to where You are, 
 'Cause all I want is more of You. 
 When You call I will follow. 
 At the cross I surrender all, 
 Jesus I belong to You. 
 I belong to You Lord 
 Your love is like fire, 
 That burns for all to see. 
 My only desire, 
 To worship at Your feet. 
 Your love is like fire, 
 That burns for all to see. 
 My only desire, 
 To worship at Your feet. 
 So let this fire 
 Consume my life. 
 Let Your love take me deeper, 
 Draw me closer to where You are, 
 'Cause all I want is more of You. 
 When You call I will follow, 
 At the cross I surrender all, 
 Jesus I belong to You. 
 Let Your love take me deeper, 
 Pull me closer to where You are, 
 Cause all I want is more of You 
 When You call I will follow, 
 At the cross I surrender all, 
 Jesus I belong to You.

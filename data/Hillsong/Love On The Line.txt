You put Your love on the line 
 To bear the weight of sin that was mine 
 Washing my river of wrongs 
 Into the sea of Your infinite love 
 With arms held high 
 Lord I give my life 
 Knowing I'm found in Christ 
 In Your love forever 
 With all I am 
 In Your grace I stand 
 The greatest of all romance 
 Love of God my Savior 
 Mercy roars like hurricane winds 
 Furious love laid waste to my sin 
 To the one who has rescued my soul 
 To the one who has welcomed me home 
 To the one who is Savior of all 
 I sing forever

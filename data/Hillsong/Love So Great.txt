Your love so great 
 Jesus in all things 
 I've seen a glimpse of Your heart 
 A billion years 
 Still I'll be singing 
 How can I praise You enough 
 You are the Lord Almighty 
 Out shining all the stars in glory 
 Your love is like the wildest ocean 
 Oh nothing else compares 
 Creation calls 
 All to the Saviour 
 We are alive for Your praise 
 In earth and sky no one is higher 
 Our God of wonders You reign 
 Not to us 
 But to Your name 
 We lift up 
 All praise

Closer than my thoughts 
 Closer than a kiss 
 How can it be more 
 Intimate than this? 
 More honest words than these I'll never find 
 With all my heart, my strength, my soul, my mind 
 I love You, I love You, 
 I'm Yours and You are mine 
 I love You, I love You, 
 I love You Jesus Christ 
 Let me hear Your voice 
 Whisper Heaven's song 
 Deeper into You 
 Is where I belong 
 More honest words than these I'll never find 
 With all my heart, my strength, my soul, my mind 
 I love You, I love You, 
 I'm Yours and You are mine 
 I love You, I love You, 
 I love You Jesus Christ

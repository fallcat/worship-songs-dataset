I will bless the Lord forever 
 And I will trust Him at all times 
 He has delivered me from all sin 
 And He has set my feet upon a rock 
 And I will not be moved 
 And I'll say of the Lord 
 You are my shield, my strength 
 My portion, Deliverer 
 My shelter, strong tower 
 My very present help in time of need 
 Whom have I in Heaven but You? 
 There's none I desire beside You 
 You have made me glad 
 And I'll say of the Lord 
 You are my shield, my strength 
 My portion, Deliverer 
 My shelter, strong tower 
 My very present help 
 You are my shield, my strength 
 My portion, Deliverer 
 My shelter, strong tower 
 My very present help in time of need 
 You have made me glad 
 And I'll say of the Lord 
 My very present help in time of need 
 (repeat)

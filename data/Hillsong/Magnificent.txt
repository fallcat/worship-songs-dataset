Who compares to You? 
 Who set the stars in their place? 
 You who calmed the raging seas 
 That came crashing over me 
 Who compares to You? 
 You who bring the morning light 
 The hope of all the earth 
 Is rest assured in Your great love 
 You are magnificent, eternally 
 Wonderful, glorious 
 Jesus 
 No one ever will compare to You 
 Jesus 
 Where the evening fades 
 You call forth songs of joy 
 As the morning wakes 
 We Your children give You praise

Here I am, humbled by Your Majesty 
 Covered by Your grace so free 
 Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man 
 Covered by the blood of the Lamb 
 Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine 
 Since You laid down Your life 
 The greatest sacrifice 
 Majesty, Majesty 
 Your grace has found me just as I am 
 Empty handed but alive in Your hands 
 Here I am humbled by the love that You give 
 Forgiven so that I can forgive 
 So here I stand 
 Knowing that I'm Your desire 
 Sanctified by glory and fire 
 And now I've found the greatest love of all is mine 
 Since You laid down Your life 
 The greatest sacrifice 
 Majesty, Majesty 
 Your grace has found me just as I am 
 Empty handed but alive in Your hands 
 Singing Majesty, Majesty 
 Forever I am changed by Your love 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 Majesty 
 We're singing Majesty, Majesty 
 Your grace has found me just as I am 
 And I'm nothing but alive in Your hands 
 We're singing Majesty, Majesty 
 Forever I am changed by Your love 
 In the beauty of Your Majesty 
 Majesty

Ma-jes-ty, King for Eternity 
 Earth and sea and Heaven 
 All is made by you--- 
 Ma-jes-ty, King for Eternity 
 Fortress of deliverance 
 Safest place to hide--- 
 We will exault your name 
 King Jesus 
 Every knee must bow infront of you-- 
 We will exault your name 
 King Jesus 
 There is non like you 
 For there is non like you. 
 King of kings, 
 Majesty, God of heaven 
 Living in me-- 
 Gentle Saviour, closest friend 
 Strong deliverer, beginning and end 
 All within me, fall at your feet 
 Your ma-jes-ty 
 Second Chorus 
 Your majesty, I can't but bow 
 I lift my all--, before you now 
 In royal robes, I don't deserve 
 I live to serve your ma-jes-ty

Man of Sorrows, Lamb of God 
 By His own betrayed 
 The sin of men and wrath of God 
 Has been on Jesus laid 
 Silent as He stood accused 
 Beaten, mocked, and scorned 
 Bowing to the Father's will 
 He took a crown of thorns 
 Oh that rugged cross, my salvation 
 Where Your love poured out over me 
 Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!" 
 Praise and honour unto Thee 
 Sent of heaven, God's own Son 
 To purchase and redeem 
 And reconcile the very ones 
 Who nailed Him to that tree 
 Oh that rugged cross, my salvation 
 Where Your love poured out over me 
 Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!" 
 Praise and honour unto Thee 
 Now my debt is paid 
 It is paid in full 
 By the precious blood 
 That my Jesus spilled 
 Now the curse of sin has no hold on me 
 Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed! 
 Oh that rugged cross, my salvation 
 Where Your love poured out over me 
 Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!" 
 Praise and honour unto Thee 
 See, the stone is rolled away 
 Behold the empty tomb 
 Hallelujah, God be praised 
 He's risen from the grave! 
 Oh that rugged cross, my salvation 
 Where Your love poured out over me 
 Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!" 
 Praise and honour unto Thee 
 Praise and honour unto Thee

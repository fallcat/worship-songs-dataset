I come to You, my God 
 The joy of my salvation 
 In You I put my trust 
 And though I walk through valleys low 
 I will fear no evil 
 Your love endures forever, reaches to the heavens 
 And though my flesh may fail me 
 You're the strength of my heart, You will always be 
 I know Your loving kindness, the power of forgiveness 
 All that I hold dear is Yours, my Jesus, it's You I long for 
 I love Your Name, oh Lord 
 I'll sing Your praises eternally 
 My life is in Your hands 
 And when darkness tries to cover me 
 I will ever give You praise 
 I will ever glorify 
 Your love endures forever, reaches to the heavens 
 And though my flesh may fail me 
 You're the strength of my heart, You will always be 
 I know Your loving kindness, the power of forgiveness 
 All that I hold dear is Yours, my Jesus, it's You I long for 
 More than anything 
 And though I walk through valleys low 
 I will fear no evil 
 Your love endures forever, reaches to the heavens 
 And though my flesh may fail me 
 You're the strength of my heart, You will always be 
 I know Your loving kindness, the power of forgiveness 
 All that I hold dear is Yours, my Jesus, it's You I long for 
 Oh it's You

Mercy mercy 
 Bring me to my knees 
 As the morning 
 Calls to light the dark in me 
 Heaven's story 
 Breathing life into my bones 
 Spirit lift me 
 From this wasteland lead me home 
 Now I 
 Find my life in Yours 
 My eyes 
 On Your name 
 Arrest my heart 
 From its reckless path 
 Release the chains in me 
 Awake my soul 
 To the hope You hold 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Humble glory 
 Chose to carry all my shame 
 Rendered worthy 
 In the shadow of Your Name 
 Gracious fury 
 Written in my Savior's scars 
 Mercy mercy 
 Now engraved upon my heart 
 Now I 
 Find my life in Yours 
 My eyes 
 On Your name 
 Arrest my heart 
 From its reckless path 
 Release the chains in me 
 Awake my soul 
 To the hope you hold 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Arrest my heart 
 From its reckless path 
 Release the chains in me 
 Awake my soul 
 To the hope you hold 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Mercy mercy 
 Bring me to my knees 
 As the morning 
 Calls to light the dark in me

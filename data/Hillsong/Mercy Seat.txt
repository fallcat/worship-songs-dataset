In the darkness, where everything is unknown 
 I faced the power of sin on my own 
 I did not know of a place I could go 
 Where I could find a way to heal my wounded soul 
 He said that I could come into His presence without fear 
 Into the holy place where His mercy hovers near 
 I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the mercy seat 
 Where Jesus is calling, He said His grace would cover me 
 His blood will flow freely, It will provide the healing 
 I'm running to the mercy seat, I'm running to the mercy seat 
 Are you living where hope has not been 
 Lost in a curse of a lifetime of sin 
 Look, the illusions, they never come true 
 I know where there's a place of mercy for you 
 He said that you could come into His presence without fear 
 Into the holy place where His mercy hovers near 
 Come running, come running, come running to the mercy seat 
 Where Jesus is calling, His grace will be a covering 
 His blood will flow freely, It will provide the healing 
 Come running to the mercy seat

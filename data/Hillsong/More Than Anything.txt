You knew us from the start, our every moment 
 Though we fell apart You chose to love us 
 Never letting go, You sent Your Son for us 
 He came into the world with one desire 
 To lead us from our sins, remove our failures 
 So we could be with You and know ourselves as Yours 
 In a world that tries to find a way in itself 
 Searching high and low, I'm looking for a meaning 
 We will hold to what we know is truth, know is love 
 Life is found when we give ourselves all to You Lord 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life saved mine 
 Our future in Your hands our lives with purpose 
 Sins now erased, our past behind us 
 Never looking back, we know ourselves as Yours 
 In a world that tries to find a way in itself 
 Searching high and low, I'm looking for a meaning 
 We will hold to what we know is truth, know is love 
 Life is found when we give ourselves all to You Lord 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life saved mine 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life 
 Give it all, give it all to the One who's life saved mine, yeah 
 This we know we have a new life 
 We are Yours now and forever 
 In this life all that we seek is to be with You 
 More than anything 
 This we know we have a new life 
 We are Yours now and forever 
 In this life all that we seek is to be with You 
 More than anything 
 This we know we have a new life 
 We are Yours now and forever

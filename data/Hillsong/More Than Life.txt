Stand by everything You said 
 Stand by the promises we made 
 Let go of everything I 've done 
 I'll run into Your open arms 
 And all I know 
 I love You more than life 
 I love You more than life 
 Fall back on everything You've done 
 Fall back on everlasting arms 
 When all the world is swept away 
 You are all the things I need 
 You're the air I breathe 
 How can it be 
 You were the one on the cross 
 Lifted for all our shame? 
 How can it be 
 The scars in Your hands are for me? 
 You are the king of all

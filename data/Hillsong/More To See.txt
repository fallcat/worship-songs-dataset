Well I know that I may have had 
 My share of failing and falling 
 But I have come to understand 
 One thing remains 
 By all He's done 
 I have been made holy 
 Worthy of serving the One 
 The One who wrote eternity 
 So deep in my heart 
 Open your eyes and see 
 The wonder of a life 
 So wonderfully free 
 Lift up your head believe 
 There is more 
 There's so much more to see 
 You remind me still 
 Of the hope and promise 
 Daring my heart to be brave 
 And all the while 
 You strengthen me 
 So deep in my heart 
 His mercies are new every morning 
 His mercies are new every day 
 His mercies are new every morning 
 Beautifully new every day 
 Lift up your eyes and see 
 Lift up your eyes and see 
 Lift up your eyes and see 
 Lift up your eyes and see

See a light in the darkness 
 A city shining without a veil 
 This hill becoming a mountain 
 A solid rock that will never fail 
 Your Name my hope 
 Fortress in the raging storm 
 My heart is Your home 
 Jesus let Your love take hold 
 The Stone the builders rejected 
 Laid to ransom a fractured bride 
 Our crushing weight on Your shoulders 
 You stand forever with arms stretched wide 
 For Your Name 
 Heart and soul 
 My life is Yours a living stone 
 For Your glory 
 Heart and soul 
 Surrendered all to build a home 
 Your Name my sure foundation 
 The hope of glory for one and all 
 Your love endures forever 
 A holy mountain that will not fall 
 All the earth welcome home 
 In every heart Your will be done 
 All creation welcome home 
 This hope is ours 
 Your kingdom come 
 We cry holy holy holy 
 We cry holy is Your Name

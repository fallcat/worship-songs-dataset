I won't stop, never gonna stop praising 
 Everyday You'll be my number one 
 Jesus, Jesus my number one 
 As the sun comes up 'til it's going back down 
 No, I'll never back down from living for You my God 
 I'm living for truth my God 
 As time goes by and the seasons change 
 No, I'm never gonna change my love for You my God 
 My hope in You my God, everybody now 
 I won't stop, never gonna stop praising 
 Everyday You'll be my number one 
 Jesus, Jesus my number one 
 As I wake up in the morning 
 And I'm ready to start my day 
 I'll Praise You my God 
 No matter what I face 
 Gonna put my faith in You 
 I'll praise You my God 
 And the end of the day 
 Gonna stand my ground and say 
 I'll Praise You my God 
 Wave your hands in the air 
 And tell me that You're gonna do 
 I'll praise You my God 
 I won't stop 
 Never gonna stop praising 
 Never gonna stop praising 
 Never gonna stop praising 
 Never gonna stop praising

You hold the future in Your hands, 
 You know my dreams and You have a plan 
 And as You light my way 
 I'll follow You. 
 My eyes on all of the above, 
 My soul secure in all You've done. 
 My mind's made up and You are the only one for me. 
 Jesus saviour, 
 In my life You are everything. 
 My future decided 
 I will praise Your name. 
 Now I know that I am, 
 I am Yours, 
 Yeah I know that I am, 
 I am Yours. 
 With all the earth in Your command 
 You are the rock on which I stand 
 And as I live each day 
 I'll follow You. 
 Jesus saviour, 
 In my life You are everything. 
 My future decided 
 I will praise Your name. 
 Now I know that I am, 
 I am Yours, 
 Yeah I know that I am, 
 I am Yours. 
 Unafraid, unashamed, Lord we know who we are

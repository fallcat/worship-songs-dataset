Your faithful love 
 Has always been there for me 
 The greatest ove 
 That I've ever known 
 What can I give to you 
 For all you've given to me 
 You gave it all 
 And you are all I need 
 You are my King, You are my God 
 The praises I bring, come from my heart 
 This is for You, 
 For all you've done for me 
 And I want it to show you 
 How much you mean 
 My God, my God

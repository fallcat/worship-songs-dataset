Perfect in love 
 Lord, You came to earth 
 To rescue me 
 You took my place upon that cross 
 The stains that held me back 
 Were washed away 
 You made me whole 
 Your love has set 
 The broken captives free 
 Your love released 
 The chains once binding me 
 I'm found in grace 
 In love's embrace 
 My heart is overwhelmed 
 I stand redeemed 
 Your Spirit now alive within my heart 
 I walk with you all of my days 
 I shall live to glorify You God 
 Hear my soul rejoice 
 Your love has set 
 The broken captives free 
 Your love released the chains once binding me 
 I'm found in grace 
 In love's embrace 
 My heart is overwhelmed 
 Sings my soul of how 
 Your love has set me free 
 Sings my heart of how 
 Your mercy rescued me 
 Hear my cry of endless love 
 To my Saviour and to my King 
 My heart is overwhelmed 
 Sings my soul of how 
 Your love has set me free 
 Sings my heart of how 
 Your mercy rescued me 
 Hear my cry of endless love 
 To my Saviour and to my King 
 My heart is overwhelmed

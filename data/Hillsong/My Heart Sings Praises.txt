My heart sings praises each time I say Your name 
 This love is deeper than simple words can say 
 You go before me, You make a perfect way 
 My one desire is to give You perfect praise 
 In my heart You are the power 
 In my night never failing light 
 With every breath that I take 
 I'll declare the things You've done 
 In my mind mighty Overcomer 
 In my soul the reason why 
 In my life You are the fire that calls me on

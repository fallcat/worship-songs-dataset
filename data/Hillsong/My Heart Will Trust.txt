I'll walk closer now on the higher way 
 Through the darkest night will You hold my hand? 
 Jesus, guide my way 
 Oh, You mourn with me and You dance with me 
 For my heart of hearts is bound to You 
 Though I walk through valleys low 
 I'll fear no evil 
 By the waters still my soul 
 My heart will trust in You 
 Though I walk through valleys low 
 I'll fear no evil 
 By the waters still my soul 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 Oh, You counsel me and You comfort me 
 When I cannot see, You light my path 
 Though I walk through valleys low 
 I'll fear no evil 
 By the waters still my soul 
 My heart will trust in You 
 Though I walk through valleys low 
 I'll fear no evil 
 By the waters still my soul 
 My heart will trust in You 
 Though I walk through valleys low 
 I'll fear no evil 
 By the waters still my soul 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 Though I walk through valleys low 
 I'll fear no evil 
 By the waters still my soul 
 My heart will trust in You 
 Though I walk through valleys low 
 I'll fear no evil 
 By the waters still my soul 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You 
 My heart will trust in You

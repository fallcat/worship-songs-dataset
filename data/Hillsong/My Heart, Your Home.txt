Come and make my heart Your home 
 Come and be everything I am and all I know 
 Search me through and through 
 Till my heart becomes a home for You 
 Oh, come and make my heart Your home 
 Come and be everything I am and all I know 
 And search me through and through 
 Till my heart becomes a home for You 
 A home for you 
 A home for you 
 Let everything I do 
 Open up a door for you to come through 
 And then my heart will be a place where you wanna be 
 Come and make my heart Your home 
 Come and be everything I am and all I know 
 And search me through and through 
 Till my heart becomes a home for You 
 A home for you 
 A home for you 
 Let everything I do 
 Open up a door for you to come through 
 And then my heart will be a place where you wanna be 
 Come and make my heart, come and make it Your home 
 Come and be everything I am and all I know 
 And search me through and through 
 Till my heart becomes a home for You 
 Till my heart becomes a home for You 
 Till my heart becomes a home for You 
 A home for You

You are righteous 
 You love justice 
 And those who honour You 
 Will see your face 
 I will arise and lift my eyes to see 
 Your majesty 
 Your holiness 
 And all I am will bless you 
 My hope is in the Name of the Lord 
 Where my help comes from 
 You're my strength, my song 
 My trust is in the Name of the Lord 
 I will sing your praise 
 You are faithful

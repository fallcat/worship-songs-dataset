I know he rescued my soul 
 His blood has covered my sin 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 My shame His taken away 
 My pain is healed in his name 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I'll raise a banner 
 'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave 
 My Redeemer Lives 
 My Redeemer Lives 
 My Redeemer Lives 
 My Redeemer Lives 
 You Lift my burdens 
 I'll rise with You 
 I'm dancing on this mountain top to see your kingdom come

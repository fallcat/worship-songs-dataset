God will always be my story 
 Nothing less than Christ my Savior 
 God will always be my hope 
 Nothing more than Christ alone 
 And this will be my story 
 And this will be my song 
 My chains are broken 
 I am free 
 And this will be my story 
 And this will be my song 
 I'll praise You my Savior 
 Jesus 
 Take my life but give me Jesus 
 To know You God is why I live 
 Take the world but give me Jesus 
 For all my days I'll follow You 
 And this will be my story 
 And this will be my song 
 My chains are broken 
 I am free 
 And this will be my story 
 And this will be my song 
 I'll praise You my Savior 
 Jesus 
 We lift Your name up 
 We lift Your name 
 You are higher 
 There's no one like You, Jesus 
 (x4) 
 And this will be my story 
 And this will be my song 
 My chains are broken 
 I am free 
 And this will be my story 
 And this will be my song 
 I'll praise You my Savior 
 Jesus 
 We lift Your name up 
 We lift Your name 
 You are higher 
 There's no one like You, Jesus 
 (x4)

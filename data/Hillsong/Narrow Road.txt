We walk on this narrow road 
 Now restored as one we walk 
 In Your hope 
 And though 
 Darkness fills our path 
 Fear won't fix its hold on us 
 For we know 
 Love will shine before us on our path 
 And guide our every step within the dark 
 We bear tidings of Your hope 
 Freedom from the sinner's plight 
 Through Your love 
 Our eyes set upon this task 
 Truth in hand as one we walk 
 We advance 
 Love will shine before us on our path 
 To guide our every step within the dark 
 To know You is our only cry 
 Knowing You our only cry 
 Knowing You our only cry 
 Lord here we are with humbled hearts 
 To see your will be done 
 Let love shape us to Your own design 
 To bear our Maker's sign 
 Love will shine before us on our path 
 To guide our every step within the dark 
 To know You is our only cry 
 Knowing You our only cry 
 Knowing You our only cry

I need you here... I need you here... 
 You're like the rain that falls 
 Fall on this heart and make me new 
 I look to you... I look to you... 
 You're king king above the earth... 
 And you have put heaven in my heart... 
 I only want to bwe where you are... 
 Holy, holy is the Lord king of glory... 
 Forever saviour of the world... 
 Though mountains may be moved... 
 And fall into the raging seas... 
 You'll never let me fall... 
 You hold me in your nail-scared hands

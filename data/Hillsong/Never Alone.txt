In the dark You lift my eyes 
 For this journey You designed 
 Your light guiding me 
 Let my heart align with You 
 In Your Word and in Your Truth 
 Your voice calling me 
 Faith in the unseen 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 Though my world may fall and fail 
 You alone are sovereign still 
 Constant in my trial 
 On the Earth Your kingdom reign 
 All creation brings You praise 
 Jesus You are Life 
 Your name lifted high 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 My soul revived in your broken hands 
 Gracious blood wore my sin and shame 
 Now forever until the end 
 Oh, You reign 
 Oh, You reign 
 My soul revived in your broken hands 
 Gracious blood wore my sin and shame 
 Now forever until the end 
 Oh, You reign 
 Oh, You reign 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 Oh You reign in my soul 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone

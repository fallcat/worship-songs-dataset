Find me with open arms 
 Pull me towards Your heart 
 Swept away in the tides of Your Spirit 
 Your hope will not resign 
 Your grace cannot run dry 
 I will dive into You 
 For all my days 
 In Your shadow I will remain 
 Oh I could stay here forever 
 By Your side 
 I know You won't shy away 
 I am never forsaken 
 In dark and sleepless nights 
 To You I'm holding tight 
 I will rest in the depths of Your mercy 
 You drench my weary soul 
 Your Spirit overflows 
 Here I soak in Your love 
 I'm covered by Your love 
 It's surging in my heart 
 Forever I am found in You my God 
 My feet had wandered far 
 But now I'm where You are 
 Forever I am found in You my God

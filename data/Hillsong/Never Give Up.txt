The rain may be falling and lightning fills the sky 
 But the sun is rising 
 God is on my side 
 The wind may blow around me and thunder may go boom 
 The clouds are disappearing 
 Your light is shining through 
 Never give up 'cause He's always there 
 Never give up anytime, anywhere 
 Never give up 'cause He's always there 
 Remember God is always by your side

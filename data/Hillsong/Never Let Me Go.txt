In the shadows, 
 My spirit weak, 
 Love broke through the darkness and lifted me 
 And I know You'll never let me go. 
 In the storm, 
 In the raging sea, 
 Love conquered the fear and delivered me. 
 And I know You'll never let me go. 
 Oh love, 
 In the shadows be the light who leads me on, 
 Your love I will follow. 
 Be my guide, 
 Your will be done. 
 Oh love I surrender, 
 Now forever I'll belong in the love of the father. 
 You are faithful 
 You are strong, 
 So hold me now. 
 In this life as I walk these streets, 
 Love open my eyes, 
 Show me what You see, 
 I know, I'll never let You go.

In the crushing, in the pressing 
 You are making new wine 
 In the soil I, now surrender 
 You are breaking new ground 
 So I yield to You and to Your careful hand 
 When I trust You, I don't need to understand 
 Make me Your vessel, make me an offering 
 Make me whatever You want me to be 
 I came here with nothing but all You have given me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 In the crushing, in the pressing 
 You are making new wine 
 In the soil I, now surrender 
 You are breaking new ground 
 You are breaking new ground 
 Make me Your vessel, make me an offering 
 Make me whatever You want me to be 
 I came here with nothing but all You have given me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Where there is new wine 
 There is new power 
 There is new freedom 
 The Kingdom is here 
 I lay down my old flames 
 To carry Your new fire today 
 Where there is new wine 
 There is new power 
 There is new freedom 
 And the Kingdom is here 
 I lay down my old flames 
 To carry Your new fire today 
 Make me Your vessel, make me an offering 
 Make me whatever You want me to be 
 God, I came here with nothing but all You have given me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Make me Your vessel, make me an offering 
 Make me whatever You want me to be 
 I came here with nothing but all You have given me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Make me, make me 
 Make me Your vessel, make me an offering 
 Make me whatever You want me to be 
 God, I came here with nothing but all You have given me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Where there is new wine 
 There is new power 
 There is new freedom 
 The Kingdom is here 
 I lay down my old flames 
 To carry Your new fire today 
 Where there is new wine 
 There is new power 
 There is new freedom 
 And the Kingdom is here 
 I lay down my old flames 
 To carry Your new fire today 
 As long as You 
 Make me Your vessel, make me an offering 
 Make me whatever You want me to be 
 I came here with nothing but all You have given me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me 
 Jesus, bring new wine out of me

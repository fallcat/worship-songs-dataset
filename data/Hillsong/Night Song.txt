When I wake in the morning I will sing, 
 Sing I love You, I love You 
 As I close my eyes 
 To sleep at night I will worship, worship You 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 When I wake in the morning I will sing, 
 Sing I love You, I love You 
 As I close my eyes 
 To sleep at night I will worship, worship You 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You. 
 I love You, Jesus I love You

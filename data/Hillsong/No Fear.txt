I am not afraid 
 You have called me by name 
 I am your child 
 My weakness is your strength 
 I stand on rock not sand 
 I live to fulfil your plan 
 (Repeat) 
 When I go through the waters 
 You will be with me 
 When I go through the rivers 
 I will not drown 
 When I walk through the fire 
 I can not be burned 
 Your the rock on which I stand 
 I have no need to fear 
 I walk with you so near 
 My god supplies all my needs 
 Today I sing this song 
 And think of what you've done 
 I will not rest till the world sees

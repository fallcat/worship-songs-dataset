We've got nothing to lose 
 We've got no reason to hide 
 We've got the answer inside of us 
 It's time we took our disguises off 
 See Your glory revealed 
 See Your name lifted high 
 'Cause there is nobody else for us 
 Jesus you are the only one 
 You are alive and we are free 
 You are everything, everything we need 
 There's not a minute to waste 
 Not a second to lose 
 'Cause there's a city that waits for us 
 It's time to took all the lamp shades off 
 See Your glory revealed 
 See Your name lifted higher 
 'Cause there is nobody else for us 
 Jesus you are the only one 
 You are alive and we are free 
 You are everything, everything we need 
 Love has spoken and we believe 
 You are everything, everything we need 
 Nothing compares to You 
 Nothing could ever separate us now 
 This love is ours 
 Nothing compares to You 
 Nothing could ever separate us now 
 This love is ours 
 Nothing compares to You 
 Nothing could ever separate us now 
 This love 
 You are alive and we are free 
 You are everything, everything we need 
 Love has spoken and we believe 
 You are everything, everything we need 
 Nothing can separate us 
 Nothing can come between us 
 Nothing can separate us now 
 Nothing can separate us 
 Nothing can come between us 
 Nothing can separate us now 
 Nothing can separate us 
 Nothing can come between us 
 Nothing can separate us now 
 Nothing 
 Nothing 
 Nothing can separate us now

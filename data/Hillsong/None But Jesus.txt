In the quiet 
 In the stillness 
 I know that You are God 
 In the secret of Your presence 
 I know there I am restored 
 When You call I won't refuse 
 Each new day again I'll choose 
 There is no one else for me 
 None but Jesus 
 Crucified to set me free 
 Now I live to bring Him praise 
 In the chaos in confusion 
 I know You're sovereign still 
 In the moment of my weakness 
 You give me grace to do Your will 
 When You call I won't delay 
 This my song through all my days 
 All my delight is in You Lord 
 All of my hope 
 All of my strength 
 All my delight is in You Lord 
 Forever more

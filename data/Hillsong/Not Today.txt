Trouble won't throw me, won't break me 
 Won't scare me no more 
 Fear must have thought I was faithless 
 When it came for my heart 
 'Cause I got a song that will never die 
 I know Your love is the reason why 
 I'll sing the night into the morning 
 I'll sing the fear into Your praise 
 I'll sing my soul into Your presence 
 Whenever I say Your name 
 Let the devil know not today 
 Tell me did the enemy panic 
 As You took up that cross 
 Tell me did the darkness cry mercy 
 As You rolled back that rock 
 'Cause I know Your life is the life in mine 
 I know Your love is the reason why 
 I'll sing the night into the morning 
 I'll sing the fear into Your praise 
 I'll sing my soul into Your presence 
 Whenever I say Your name 
 Let the devil know not today 
 Whenever I say Your name, Jesus 
 Let the devil know not today 
 Not now, not ever again 
 Your love stood down death 
 Crushed the devil's head 
 Fear is just a liar 
 Running out of breath 
 The fight beneath Your feet 
 I'm standing on Jesus name 
 So let the devil know not today 
 Let the devil know not today, no, no 
 Not now, not ever again, Jesus 
 Let the devil know not today 
 Not today, not today 
 I'll sing the night into the morning 
 I'll sing the fear into Your praise 
 I'll sing my soul into Your presence 
 Whenever I say Your name, Jesus 
 Let the devil know not today 
 Let the devil know not today, no, no 
 Not now, not ever again 
 Let the devil know not today 
 Let the devil know not today 
 Let the devil know not today

Oh! precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow; 
 No other fount I know, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
 What can wash away my sin? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
 What can make me whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
 Oh! precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow; 
 No other fount I know, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
 This is all my hope and peace, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
 This is all my righteousness, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
 Oh! precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow; 
 No other fount I know, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
 Glory! Glory! This I sing 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus, 
 All my praise for this I bring 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
 Oh! precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow; 
 No other fount I know, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

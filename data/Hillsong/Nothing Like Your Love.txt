Love unchanging 
 God Your mercy never fades 
 And I'm surrounded 
 By Your compassion and Your grace 
 Your love 
 Brighter than the sun 
 More beautiful than words could ever say 
 This endless light 
 Shining over all 
 It leads me to Your glory everlasting 
 In Your kindness 
 For the broken and the lost 
 You gave Your only Son 
 To bear my shame upon the cross 
 Your love amazing 
 Fills my heart and I sing out 
 There is none like You 
 There is nothing like 
 Your love amazing 
 Fills my heart and I sing out 
 There is none like You 
 There is nothing like Your love 
 There is nothing like Your love

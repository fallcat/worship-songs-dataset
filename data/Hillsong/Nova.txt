Let all the earth declare Your name 
 Voices resounding heaven's fame 
 Our God be praised forever 
 Flood all the earth with endless light 
 Raise up the streets from death to life 
 Our God be praised forever 
 Oh God, be praised 
 Come, let Your glory arise 
 And shine as the nations collide with Your story 
 Love overtaking our lives 
 Arise as our hearts come alight with Your glory 
 Let all injustice shut it's mouth 
 As we join our hearts and start to shout 
 Our God be praised forever 
 Oh God, be praised 
 Come, let Your glory arise 
 And shine as the nations collide with Your story 
 Love overtaking our lives 
 Arise as our hearts come alight with Your glory 
 Be unto Your name 
 All glory and honor 
 Singing holy is our God 
 Holy is our God 
 Your life on display 
 Your strength in our weakness 
 Singing holy is our God 
 Holy is our God 
 How great is Your love 
 How great are Your ways 
 There's nothing we want more 
 But to live for You, God 
 There's no other name 
 More worthy of praise 
 Jesus, let Your love be known 
 Come, let Your glory arise 
 And shine as the nations collide with Your story 
 Love overtaking our lives 
 Arise as our hearts come alight with Your glory 
 We'll shine with Your glory 
 We'll shine with Your glory 
 We'll shine with Your glory 
 It's all for Your glory

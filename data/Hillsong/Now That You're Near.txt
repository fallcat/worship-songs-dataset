I stand before You Lord 
 And give You all my praise 
 Your love is all I need 
 Jesus You're all I need 
 My life belongs to You 
 You gave Your life for me 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Jesus You're all I need 
 Hold me in Your arms 
 Never let me go 
 I want to spend eternity with You 
 And now (that) You're near 
 Everything is different 
 Everything's so different Lord 
 I know I'm not the same 
 My life You've changed 
 I want to be with You 
 I want to be with You 
 And I will sing for You always 
 'Cause in Your presence God 
 Is where I want to stay

God of eternity You reign 
 With justice and mercy truth and grace 
 Gift of salvation to the lost 
 And by Your word You'll build Your church 
 And Your Kingdom will know no end 
 Let Your voice be heard in all of the earth 
 Let this generation rise to be 
 Your glorious church, Hope to the nations 
 Let this generation rise now 
 For a such a time as this we've come 
 To carry the cause of Christ freedom 
 Lord raise us up to be Your light 
 The answer of hope to all of the world 
 And Your Kingdom will know no end 
 Now is the time right now 
 Your church will arise now

O, holy night 
 The stars are brightly shining 
 It is the night 
 Of the dear Savior's birth 
 Long lay the world 
 In sin and error pining 
 Till He appeared 
 And the soul felt its worth 
 A thrill of hope 
 The weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks 
 A new and glorious morn 
 Fall on your knees 
 Oh, hear the angel voices 
 O, night divine 
 The night when Christ was born 
 Truly He taught 
 Us to love one another 
 His law is love 
 And His gospel is peace 
 Chains, He shall break 
 For the slave is our brother 
 And in His name 
 All oppression shall cease 
 Sweet hymns of joy 
 In grateful chorus raise we 
 With all our hearts 
 We praise His holy name 
 Christ is the Lord 
 And we shall ever praise Him 
 His power and glory 
 Ever more proclaim 
 O, night divine 
 The night when Christ was born 
 Fall on your knees 
 O, hear the angel voices 
 O, night divine 
 The night when Christ was born

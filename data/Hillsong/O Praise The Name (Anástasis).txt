I cast my mind to Calvary 
 Where Jesus bled and died for me 
 I see His wounds, His hands, His feet 
 My Savior on that cursed tree 
 His body bound and drenched in tears 
 They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb 
 The entrance sealed by heavy stone 
 Messiah still and all alone 
 O praise the name of the Lord our God 
 O praise His name forever more 
 For endless days we will sing Your praise 
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God 
 And then on the third at break of dawn 
 The Son of heaven rose again 
 O trampled death where is your sting? 
 The angels roar for Christ the King 
 O praise the name of the Lord our God 
 O praise His name forever more 
 For endless days we will sing Your praise 
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God 
 He shall return in robes of white 
 The blazing Son shall pierce the night 
 And I will rise among the saints 
 My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face 
 O praise the name of the Lord our God 
 O praise His name forever more 
 For endless days we will sing Your praise 
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God 
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God 
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

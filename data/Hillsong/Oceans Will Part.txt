If my heart has grown cold, there Your love will unfold 
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand 
 When I'm blind to my way, there Your Spirit will pray 
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand 
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand 
 Oceans will part, nations come 
 At the whisper of Your call 
 Hope will rise, glory shown 
 In my life Your will be done 
 Present suffering may pass, Lord, Your mercy will last 
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hands 
 And my heart will find praise, I'll delight in Your way 
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hands 
 As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand 
 Oceans will part, nations come 
 At the whisper of Your call 
 Hope will rise, glory shown 
 In my life Your will be done 
 Oceans will part, nations come 
 At the whisper of Your call 
 Hope will rise, glory shown 
 In my life Your will be done, Your will be done 
 Will be done, Your will be done 
 As You open my eyes 
 To the work of Your hand 
 Jesus open my eyes 
 To the work of Your hand 
 Oceans will part, nations come 
 At the whisper of Your call 
 Hope will rise, glory shown 
 In my life Your will be done 
 Oceans will part, nations come 
 At the whisper of Your call 
 Hope will rise, glory shown 
 In my life Your will be done 
 In my life Your will be done 
 In my life Your will be done

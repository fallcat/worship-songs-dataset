Oh, You bring hope to the hopeless 
 And light to those in the darkness 
 And death to life, now I'm alive 
 Oh, You give peace to the restless 
 And joy to homes that are broken 
 I see You now, in You I'm found 
 And You opened the door for me 
 And You laid down your life to set me free 
 All that I am will serve You Lord 
 Oh, You fill those who are empty 
 And rescue those in the valley 
 And through it all You calm my soul 
 Oh, now You find me in my weakness 
 And heal the wounds of my heartache 
 I worship You in spirit and truth 
 And You opened the door for me 
 And You laid down your life to set me free 
 All that I am will serve You Lord, You Lord 
 And You opened my eyes to see 
 All the wonder and awe of Christ in me 
 Jesus You're everything I need, I need 
 It's You I need, you're all I need 
 You're everything 
 All honor, all glory, all praise to You 
 All honor, all glory, all praise to You 
 All honor, all glory, all praise to You 
 All honor, all glory, all praise to You 
 All honor, all glory, all praise to You 
 All honor, all glory, all praise to You 
 And You opened the door for me 
 And You laid down your life to set me free 
 All that I am will serve You Lord 
 And You opened my eyes to see 
 All the wonder and awe of Christ in me 
 Jesus You're everything I need, I need 
 It's You I need, I need 
 It's You I need

More than I could hope or dream of 
 You have poured your favor on me 
 One day in the house of God is 
 Better than a thousand days in the world 
 So blessed, I can't contain it 
 So much, I've got to give it away 
 Your love taught me to live now 
 You are more than enough for me 
 More than I could hope or dream of 
 You have poured Your favor on me 
 One day in the house of God is 
 Better than a thousand days in the world 
 You see, I'm so blessed, I can't contain it 
 So much, I've got to give it away 
 Your love taught me to live now 
 You are more than enough for me 
 So blessed, I can't contain it 
 So much, I've got to give it away 
 Your love taught me to live now 
 You are more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 Lord, You're more than enough for me 
 So blessed, I can't contain it 
 So much, I've got to give it away 
 Your love taught me to live now 
 You are more than enough for me 
 So blessed, I can't contain it 
 So much, I've got to give it away 
 Your love taught me to live now

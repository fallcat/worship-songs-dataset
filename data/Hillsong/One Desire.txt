You gave it all for me 
 My soul desire, my everything 
 And all I am is devoted to You 
 How could I fail to see 
 You are the love that rescued me 
 And all I am is devoted to You 
 And oh, how could I not be moved 
 Lord here with You 
 So have Your way in me 
 Cause Lord, there is just one thing 
 That I will seek 
 This is my cry 
 My one desire 
 Is to be where You are, Lord 
 Now and forever 
 It's more than a song 
 My one desire 
 Is to be with You 
 Is to be with You, Jesus

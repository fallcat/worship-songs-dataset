I tasted the world seen more than enough 
 Its promise is fleeting 
 Of water and wine I emptied the cup 
 And found myself wanting 
 But there is a well that never runs dry 
 The water of life, the blood of the vine 
 Cause all I know is 
 Everything I have means nothing 
 Jesus if You're not my one thing 
 Everything I need right now 
 All I need is You right now 
 Just one thing I ask and this I will seek 
 If only to know You 
 To be where You are and go where You lead 
 My God I will follow 
 The things of this world I've counted as loss 
 I lay it all down to take up this cross 
 Cause all I know is 
 Everything I have means nothing 
 Jesus if You're not my one thing 
 Everything I need right now 
 Cause all I want is 
 Everything You are and nothing 
 Jesus if You're not my one thing 
 Everything to me right now 
 And I'll sing 
 Whoa whoa 
 I want nothing but to know You 
 And to be with You my God 
 And I'll sing 
 Whoa whoa 
 And with everything within me 
 I will worship You my God

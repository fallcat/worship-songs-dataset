One thing 
 One thing I desire 
 One thing I seek 
 To gaze upon Your beauty 
 Your majesty 
 In the day of trouble 
 You cover me 
 In the secret place of refuge 
 Lord I will sing 
 So I pray to You 
 So I pray to You 
 Lord Your Name is higher than the heavens 
 Lord Your Name is higher than all created things 
 Higher than hope 
 Higher than dreams 
 The Name of the Lord 
 All I want is You 
 All I want is You 
 Jesus

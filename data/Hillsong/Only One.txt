I stand before you now my Savior 
 Shouting Your praise 
 You've changed my world and made my heart sing 
 And everything I have, I lay it at Your feet 
 Everything is different now with You my God 
 You broke my chains of sin 
 You're always there to lift me when I fall 
 You never let me go, Lord I give You my all 
 Now that I've found You 
 Everything around me is changing 
 Nothing will be the same 
 Now that You've saved me 
 'Cause I'll be the one to shout You're fame forever 
 'Cause I'll be the one to sing Your praise my Savior 
 You are the strength inside of me 
 You are the light that lets me see, my only one 
 Everything is different now with You my God 
 You broke my chains of sin 
 You're always there to lift me when I fall 
 You never let me go, Lord I give You my all 
 Now that I've found You 
 Everything around me is changing 
 Nothing will be the same 
 Now that You've saved me 
 'Cause I'll be the one to shout You're fame forever 
 'Cause I'll be the one to sing Your praise my Savior 
 You are the strength inside of me 
 You are the light that lets me see, my only one 
 Now that I've found You 
 Everything around me is changing 
 Nothing will be the same 
 Now that You've saved me 
 Now that I've found You 
 Everything around me is changing 
 Nothing will be the same

This is no performance 
 Lord I pray it's worship 
 Empty words I can't afford 
 I'm not chasing feelings 
 That's not why I'm singing 
 You're the reason for my song 
 I only wanna sing 
 If I sing with everything 
 If I sing for you my King 
 I can't imagine why 
 I would do this all for hype 
 'Cause it's all to lift You high 
 You don't want perfection 
 Just my soul's attention 
 All I have is what I'll give 
 More than a song that lasts a moment 
 I'll live a life full of honest worship 
 If I'm here to sing then I'll sing with purpose 
 All the praise, Lord, You deserve it, now 
 I only wanna sing 
 If I sing with everything 
 If I sing for you my King 
 I can't imagine why 
 I would do this all for hype 
 'Cause it's all to lift You high 
 I only wanna sing 
 If I sing with everything 
 If I sing for you my King 
 I can't imagine why 
 I would do this all for hype 
 'Cause it's all to lift You high

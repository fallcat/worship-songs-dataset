On the mountain in the valley 
 Ev'rywhere I go 
 You are with me right beside me 
 You never let me go 
 The Messiah the Almighty 
 Saviour of my soul 
 Saviour of my soul 
 In the daylight in the shadow 
 Your faithfulness untold 
 You surround me and protect me 
 Guiding as I go 
 The Messiah the Almighty 
 Saviour of my soul 
 Saviour of my soul 
 There is nowhere I can run 
 There is nowhere I can hide 
 And if I ever lose my way 
 You're calling out my name 
 You're calling out my name 
 Jesus 
 Only You can save us Jesus 
 Only You can heal us Jesus 
 Only You can fix this Jesus 
 Only You (Jesus) 
 Now the boroughs have been opened 
 And the broken have been chosen 
 And the city is becoming alive in You

Signs and wonders from above 
 When You pour out Your Spirit 
 On the old and the young 
 In the power of Your presence 
 Holy Spirit rain 
 Falling like a flood 
 Break upon my praise 
 As I sing of Your love 
 Holy Spirit fire 
 Burn within my soul 
 As I call on Your Name 
 As I call on Your Name 
 Dreams and visions of the Son 
 As we stand in Your presence 
 Revelations of Your love 
 As I look to the heavens 
 Holy Spirit rain 
 Falling like a flood 
 Break upon my praise 
 As I sing of Your love 
 Holy Spirit fire 
 Burn within my soul 
 As I call on Your name 
 (Jesus) 
 Oh Holy Spirit 
 Burn like a fire 
 All consuming, consume me 
 Here in Your presence 
 Lord I surrender to Your glory 
 For Your glory 
 Living water 
 River wild in me 
 Immerse me in Your mercy 
 Open heaven 
 Crashing over me 
 Restore me in Your glory 
 Oh Holy Spirit 
 Burn like a fire 
 All consuming, consume me 
 Here in Your presence 
 Lord I surrender to Your glory 
 For Your glory

In the stars I see Your majesty displayed 
 In the heavens all Your wonders are proclaimed 
 I see Your fame in all of the earth 
 And I seek to know the ways of Your heart 
 Through the seas and open skies I hear Your praise 
 As the shout of all creation lifts Your Name 
 I hear Your praise in all of the earth 
 And I seek to know the ways of Your heart 
 So open my eyes oh God 
 Open my heart to see 
 All the wonders and the power of Your name 
 By Your grace I'll live 
 By Your grace I'll see 
 For my life and my salvation is in You 
 For You take the sinner's heart and bring new life 
 Through the cross we are restored within Your Light 
 I know Your love is all that I need 
 And I seek to know the ways of Your heart 
 I know Your love is all that I need 
 And I seek to know the ways of Your heart

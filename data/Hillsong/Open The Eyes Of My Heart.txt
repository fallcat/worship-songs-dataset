Open the eyes of my heart Lord 
 Open the eyes of my heart 
 I want to see you 
 I want to see you 
 To see You high and lifted up 
 Shining in the light of Your glory 
 Pour out Your power and love 
 As we sing holy, holy, holy 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 I want to see you 
 I want to see you

The words of Christ 
 Passed down through generations 
 The Son of God teaching us to pray 
 Echoed words 
 Father have Your will, Your way in me 
 Completely 
 We wholly trust 
 You're faithful in provision 
 Amazing grace, mercy for our sins 
 May we forgive 
 The way that You've forgiven us, oh Lord 
 So we can sing 
 Our Father 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 Forever our God be exalted 
 Your kingdom come and in us 
 Let Your will be done 
 Our Father 
 Lead us from the valley of temptation 
 Deliver us from the evil one 
 Lord You reign and here we stand 
 Victorious in Your Name 
 Together we pray 
 Our Father 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 Forever our God be exalted 
 Your kingdom come and in us 
 Let Your will be done 
 Our Father 
 Yours is the kingdom and power and glory 
 God of authority ancient of days 
 Yours is the wisdom and honour 
 Forever and always 
 And always 
 Yours is the kingdom and power and glory 
 God of authority ancient of days 
 Yours is the wisdom and honour 
 Forever and always 
 We pray 
 Our Father 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 Forever our God be exalted 
 Your kingdom come and in us 
 Let Your will be done 
 Our Father 
 Our Father 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 Forever our God be exalted 
 Your kingdom come and in us 
 Let Your will be done 
 Our Father 
 We pray 
 Our Father 
 We pray 
 Our Father

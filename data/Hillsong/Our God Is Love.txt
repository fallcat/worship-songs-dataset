Every soul every beating heart 
 Every nation and every tongue 
 Come find hope in the love of the Father 
 All creation will bow as one 
 Lift their eyes to the risen Son 
 Jesus Savior forever and after 
 This is love 
 Jesus came and died and gave His life for us 
 Let our voices rise and sing for all He's done 
 Our fear is overcome 
 Our God is love 
 Our God is love 
 Every distant and broken heart 
 Every prayer every outstretched arm 
 Finding hope in the love of the Father 
 Age to age let His praises rise 
 All the glory for all of time 
 Jesus Savior forever and after 
 Age to age we will be singing 
 In the light of all He's done 
 All the earth everyone singing 
 In the wonder of His love

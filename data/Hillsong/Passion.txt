In the grove, when your cup seemed too much 
 With the worst yet to come 
 I was on your mind 
 On the cross, as the crowds cursed your name 
 Heaven's eyes turned away 
 Still you thought of me 
 I know you love me so 
 Through it all, you were thinking of me 
 Even death couldn't keep all your love for me 
 But you died, so that I could have life 
 There's no greater love than this 
 I know you love me so 
 I know you love me so 
 Your love is still the same 
 Beginning and forever 
 I sing of all your passion won for me 
 I sing of all your love first done in me 
 Your love will never change 
 Beginning and forever 
 I sing of all your passion won for me 
 I sing of all your love first done in me 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 You're brighter than the sun 
 Risen from the shadows 
 Seated on the throne of majesty 
 Higher than the skies and all the sea 
 You're brighter than the sun 
 Risen from the shadows 
 Seated on the throne of majesty 
 Higher than the skies and all the sea 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I found you 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you

I've come to love on you 
 I've come to pledge my life to you 
 I've come to sit at your feet and sing sweet songs to you 
 I've come to give my life 
 To the greatest love of all 
 I've come to lift my hands to you 
 The desire of my heart, the lover of my soul 
 And I will worship you with all my heart 
 For you are worthy 
 And I will bow to you my perfect king, JESUS 
 I love you, Jesus 
 I love you, Jesus

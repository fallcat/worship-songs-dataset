I wanna see the broken hearts 
 Finding hope in God above 
 I wanna know I'm doing all I can 
 So with this life, with all I am 
 No matter what the cost may be 
 I pray to see your love become our cause 
 I won't stop believing 
 You alone are, You alone are God 
 In You there's freedom 
 Your love brings me to my knees again 
 We're gonna bring an anthem of love 
 We're gonna live for you now 
 This perfect love, I can't explain 
 This way of life that has no end 
 Your mercy satisfies, it's all I need 
 My purpose found in You alone 
 To love the lost and bring them home 
 We were made to glorify our king 
 Your love brings me to my knees again 
 We're gonna bring an anthem of love 
 We're gonna live for you 
 May your love become my every thought 
 I wanna know the sound of your heart 
 I wanna live for you now 
 Sing You, you bring me life 
 You bring me hope 
 You're all I need

The tide is turning 
 This is redemption's hour 
 In the midst of the world lost for love 
 You are all we have now 
 The lost returning 
 Salvation is all around 
 In the midst of the world broken down 
 You are all we have now 
 For You are God and this hope is ours 
 So Father open the skies 
 Flood the Earth with your light 
 This is love, to break a world indifferent 
 Sing 
 Our hearts are burning 
 The fire that won't burn out 
 In the midst of a world that's grown cold 
 You are all we have now 
 The earth resounding 
 The anthem of your renown 
 As we lift up our eyes 
 And look to your glory 
 Call us out let the world see 
 You are God and this hope is ours 
 So call us out, let the world see 
 You are God as we sing 
 Open the skies 
 Flood the Earth with your light 
 This is love to break a world indifferent 
 As we lift up our eyes 
 Fill our hearts with your fire 
 In a world the same we'll be the difference, the difference 
 So call us out let the world see 
 You are God and this hope is ours 
 Our eyes are open 
 Every chain now broken 
 In this world we are different 
 Let your love become us 
 As we live to make you famous 
 We're in this world but we are different 
 So call us out, let the world see 
 You are God as we sing 
 Father open the skies 
 Flood the Earth with your life 
 This is love to break a world indifferent 
 As we lift up our eyes 
 Fill our hearts with your fire 
 In a world the same we'll be the difference, the difference 
 So call us out let the world see 
 You are God one and only 
 In this world you are all we have now

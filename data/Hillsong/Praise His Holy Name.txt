(Words and music Darlene Zschech) 
 We're gonna praise His Holy Name 
 We're gonna praise His Holy Name 
 Lift Him up, above the heavens 
 Praise His Holy Name 
 Lord I want to thank You 
 For everything You've done 
 Way beyond my wildest 
 Hopes and dreams 
 Gonna lift my hands 
 And sing out loud 
 And praise His wonderful Name 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 Glory to Almighty God (Glory to Almighty God) 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 Glory to Almighty God (Glory to Almighty God)

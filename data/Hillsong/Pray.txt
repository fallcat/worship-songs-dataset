We call upon Your Name 
 Humble ourselves and pray 
 Move in our hearts, move in our land 
 Every Nation, tribe and tongue will proclaim 
 Your Kingdom come 
 We Pray, Pray 
 Open the windows of Heaven on us 
 Today, we pray, pour out Your Spirit 
 Your wonders on earth 
 We come on bended knees 
 We bring an offering 
 Lead us in Your way everlasting 
 Every heart of every man will pray 
 Your will be done. 
 Our Father, who art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 Your Kingdom come 
 Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven 
 And lead us not into temtation 
 Deliver us from evil 
 For thine is The Kingdom, 
 The Power and Glory, 
 Forever and ever.

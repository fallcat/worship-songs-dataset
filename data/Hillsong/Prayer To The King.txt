We seek the Son of God 
 We seek the Risen Lord 
 We seek the King of kings 
 The Savior of the world 
 We give our lives to You 
 We choose to follow You 
 We believe in You 
 We worship You 
 We seek Your face and 
 Humble ourselves here 
 The fire of God 
 Consuming the hearts of man 
 Nations will bow to You 
 Kingdoms will shake before 
 You 
 We pray for revival

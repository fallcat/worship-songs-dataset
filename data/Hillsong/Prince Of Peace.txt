My heart a storm, clouds raging deep within 
 The Prince of peace came bursting through the wind 
 The violent sky held its breath 
 And in Your light I found rest 
 Tearing through the night 
 Riding on the storm 
 Staring down the fight 
 My eyes found Yours 
 Shining like the sun 
 Striding through my fear 
 The Prince of peace 
 Met me there 
 You heard my prayer 
 Hope like the sun, light piercing through the dark 
 The Prince of peace came and broke into my heart 
 The violent cross, the empty grave 
 And in Your light I found grace 
 Tearing through the night 
 Riding on the storm 
 Staring down the fight 
 My eyes found Yours 
 Shining like the sun 
 Striding through my fear 
 The Prince of peace 
 Met me there 
 You're always there 
 And You hear my prayer 
 Your love surrounds me 
 When my thoughts wage war 
 When night screams terror 
 There Your voice will roar 
 Come death or shadow 
 God I know Your light will meet me there 
 When fear comes knocking 
 There You'll be my guard 
 When day breeds trouble 
 There You'll hold my heart 
 Come storm or battle 
 God I know Your peace will meet me there 
 (Again and again) 
 Oh, be still my heart 
 I know that You are God 
 Oh fear no evil 
 For I know You are here 
 And my soul will know Your love surrounds me 
 When my thoughts wage war 
 When night screams terror 
 There Your voice will roar 
 Come death or shadow 
 God I know Your light will meet me there 
 And my soul will know 
 When fear comes knocking 
 There You'll be my guard 
 When day breeds trouble 
 There You'll hold my heart 
 Come storm or battle 
 God I know Your peace will meet me there 
 Oh, be still my heart 
 And my soul will ever know that You are God 
 And You heard my prayer

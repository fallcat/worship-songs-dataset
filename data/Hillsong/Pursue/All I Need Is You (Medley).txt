I close my eyes to see 
 My king in majesty 
 Your grace compels my soul 
 To love and drawing close 
 I lift my hands and sing 
 Surrender everything 
 In you I know I'm found 
 My God, to you I'll bow 
 Now until forever 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 Show me what I don't know 
 More of you 
 I'm desperate for your presence 
 Longing to be with you 
 Lead me to a new place 
 More of you 
 Through the fire I'll persevere 
 I won't submit to any fear 
 Where I'll go, you've been before 
 All my trust is in you, lord 
 Now until forever 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 Show me what I don't know 
 More of you 
 I'm desperate for your presence 
 Longing to be with you 
 Lead me to a new place 
 More of you 
 Lead me to you 
 Forever, lord, I will pursue 
 I will pursue 
 You've won my heart 
 Jesus, you're all that I want 
 All that I want 
 Now until forever 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 Show me what I don't know 
 More of you 
 I'm desperate for your presence 
 Longing to be with you 
 Lead me to a new place 
 More of you 
 Open my eyes 
 Let me see more of your love 
 More of your love 
 Here I will wait 
 Just for a glimpse of you, God 
 I'll wait for you, God 
 All I need is You 
 All I need is You Lord

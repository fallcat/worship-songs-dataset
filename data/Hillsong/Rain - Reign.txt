Everything starts in You 
 Made to be beautiful 
 Nothing could tear Your heart 
 From the covenant You made for love 
 Everything moves in time 
 Played into Your design 
 Nothing could tear Your heart 
 From the world You died to save 
 You fall like rain 
 In fire and thunder 
 The mountains melt 
 Like wax before You 
 Everything finds its place 
 Folding beneath Your ways 
 Nothing could stand against 
 Your resurrected name 
 You fall like rain 
 In fire and thunder 
 The mountains melt 
 Like wax before You 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 In everlasting grace and wonder 
 Your love making all things new 
 Your love making everything beautiful 
 My God 
 Making all things new 
 Everything turning from ruin to life in You 
 Making all things new 
 Everything turning to something so beautiful 
 Your goodness, Your mercy 
 Your promise crashing down like rain 
 Your kingdom, Your glory 
 Your presence breaking out 
 Like rain! 
 In fire and thunder 
 The mountains melt 
 Like wax before You 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 In everlasting grace and wonder 
 Your love making all things new 
 Your love making everything beautiful 
 Everything ends in praise 
 Shining in Your embrace 
 Nothing could tear Your heart 
 From the promise that remains 
 You fall like rain 
 In fire and thunder 
 The mountains melt 
 Like wax before You 
 Your kingdom reigns 
 In everlasting grace and wonder 
 Your love making all things new 
 Your love making everything beautiful

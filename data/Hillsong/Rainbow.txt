It's not a secret, it's not a fairytale 
 It's not made up, Jonas was in a whale 
 For three whole days, 1,2,3! 
 The greatest treasure, the Word God's people wrote 
 It's in the Bible, where Noah built a boat 
 And it rained and rained 
 The rainbows in the sky to show God's promises are true 
 THe rainbows in the sky to show the world 
 He's the only way for your everyday

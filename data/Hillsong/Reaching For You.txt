I can't believe the way Your love has got a hold on me 
 Each morning I wake to find You near 
 You lift me above my fears and set my feet on solid ground 
 All of my days belong to You 
 And I breathe in Your breath of life that fills my heart 
 You are my all consuming fire 
 I stand here before You in wide opened wonder 
 Amazed at the glory of You 
 The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me 
 As I'm reaching for You 
 I can't believe the way Your love has got a hold on me 
 Each morning I wake to find You near 
 You lift me above my fears and set my feet on solid ground 
 All of my days belong to You 
 And I breathe in Your breath of life that fills my heart 
 You are my all consuming fire 
 And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder 
 Amazed at the glory of You 
 The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me 
 As I'm reaching for You 
 And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder 
 Amazed at the glory of You 
 The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me 
 As I'm reaching for You 
 And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder 
 Amazed at the glory of You 
 The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me 
 As I'm reaching for You 
 And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder 
 Amazed at the glory of You 
 The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me 
 As I'm reaching for You 
 Reaching for You 
 Reaching for You 
 Reaching for You 
 And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder 
 Amazed at the glory of You 
 The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me 
 As I'm reaching for You

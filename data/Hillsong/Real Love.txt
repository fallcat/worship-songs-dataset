Staring into Your eyes 
 Makes my heart come alive 
 Suddenly brought to life 
 When I met You 
 Reaching beyond the skies 
 Running deep, stretching wide 
 Perfect love realized 
 Here with You 
 Yeah this love is for real 
 You will never let go 
 Never let go, oh 
 And it's more than just words 
 Love beyond my control 
 Out of control 
 This is real love 
 This is real love 
 This is real love 
 This is real love 
 You're pulling me closer and closer 
 Holding my heart till the very end 
 Jesus, I'm found in your freedom 
 This is real love, this is real love 
 In Your heart, I'm found 
 I want You, I want You 
 You won't let me down 
 You got me, You got me 
 Yeah this love is for real 
 You will never let go 
 Never let go, oh 
 And it's more than just words 
 Love beyond my control 
 Out of control 
 You're pulling me closer and closer 
 Holding my heart till the very end 
 Jesus, I'm found in your freedom 
 This is real love, this is real love 
 Oh 
 You're pulling me closer and closer 
 Holding my heart till the very end 
 Jesus, I'm found in your freedom 
 This is real love, this is real love 
 Oh 
 Staring into Your eyes 
 Makes my heart come alive 
 Suddenly brought to life 
 When I met You 
 This is real love 
 This is real love 
 This is real love 
 This is real love 
 You're pulling me closer and closer 
 Holding my heart till the very end 
 Jesus, I'm found in your freedom 
 This is real love, this is real love 
 This is real love

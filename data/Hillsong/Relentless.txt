Salvation sounds a new beginning 
 As distant hearts begin believing 
 Redemption's bid is unrelenting 
 Your love goes on 
 Your love goes on 
 You carry us 
 Carry us 
 When the world gives way 
 You cover us 
 Cover us 
 With Your endless grace 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 The time is up for chasing shadows 
 You gave the world a light to follow 
 A hope that shines beyond tomorrow 
 Your love goes on 
 Your love goes on 
 You carry us 
 Carry us 
 When the world gives way 
 You cover us 
 Cover us 
 With Your endless grace 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 Tearing through the veil of darkness 
 Breaking every chain, You set us free 
 Fighting for the furthest heart You gave 
 Your own life for all to see 
 Tearing through the veil of darkness 
 Breaking every chain, You set us free 
 Fighting for the furthest heart You gave 
 Your life 
 (You carry us, carry us 
 You cover us, cover us) 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless 
 Your love is relentless...

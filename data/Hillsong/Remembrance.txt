I take the bread of life 
 Broken for all my sin 
 Your body crucified 
 To make me whole again 
 I will recall the cup 
 Poured out in sacrifice 
 To trade this sinner's end 
 For Your new covenant 
 Hallelujah 
 I'll live my life in remembrance 
 Hallelujah 
 Your promise I won't forget 
 I'll walk salvation's road 
 With fear and trembling 
 Your way borne as my own 
 As Christ is formed in me 
 Hallelujah 
 I'll live my life in remembrance 
 Hallelujah 
 Your promise I won't forget 
 If ever I should lose my way 
 If ever I deny Your grace 
 Remind me of the price You paid 
 Hallelujah 
 I'll live in remembrance 
 You've been so, so good to me 
 You've been so, so good to me 
 Oh to think where I would be 
 If not for You 
 If not for You 
 You've been so, so good to me 
 You've been so, so good to me 
 Oh to think where I would be 
 If not for You 
 If not for You 
 If not for You 
 If not for You 
 As far as heights reach from the depths 
 As far as east is from the west 
 So far Your grace has carried me 
 Until I see You face to face 
 Until at last I've won my race 
 Remind me You're not finished yet 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 I'll live in remembrance

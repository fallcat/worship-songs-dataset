Your faithfulness endures always 
 Where mountains fall and reason fails 
 And You calm the raging seas 
 And You calm the storms in me, again 
 All I know is I find rest in You 
 All I know is I find rest in You 
 My heart will praise throughout the night 
 Where singing seems a sacrifice 
 And You calm the raging seas 
 And You calm the storms in me, again 
 All I know is I find rest in You 
 All I know is I find rest in You 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Your grace is all I need 
 Your grace is all I need 
 All I know is I find rest in You 
 All I know is I find rest in You 
 All I know is I find rest in You 
 All I know is I find rest in You

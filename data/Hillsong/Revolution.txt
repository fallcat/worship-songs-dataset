One generation living salvation 
 Here we go 
 Seeing revival we will defy all 
 That holds us back from You 
 So we will rise together 
 And with one voice to say 
 Jesus is our Saviour 
 There will be no other 
 We will shout it out 
 We want the world to know 
 One generation living salvation 
 Living for You 
 Seeing revival we will defy all 
 That holds us back from You 
 This is the generation 
 We live devoted to Your Name 
 This is the revolution 
 We will not leave this world the same 
 'Cause we want the world to know 
 We want the world to know 
 We live our lives for You 
 In all we say and do 
 We want the world to know 
 We want the world to know

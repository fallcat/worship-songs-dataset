My life is a light for Your cause 
 My will laid aside for Your call 
 And reserved are the depths of my heart 
 Only for You 
 I'm caught in the rhythms of grace 
 They overcome all of my ways 
 Realigning each step everyday 
 To live for Your glory 
 There's none beside You God 
 There's none beside You God 
 You're there in the dark of the night 
 While holding the sun and it's light 
 Through the triumph and trials alike 
 There's no-one beside You 
 Your voice called the stars by their name 
 'Cause You whispered them all to their place 
 To testify to Your wonder and praise 
 Both now and forever 
 There's none beside You God 
 There's none beside You God 
 I love my life to shine Your light 
 'Cause there's none beside You God 
 No eye has seen 
 No ear has heard 
 The depths of Your love, Lord 
 No mind can fathom 
 The love You deserve 
 How great You are

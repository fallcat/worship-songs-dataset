All the earth come alive, lift your eyes to the morning 
 Let our hearts beat again with a lifeblood that never fails 
 Your love, it will never fail 
 Breaking down the divide in a holy collision 
 The Divine in disguise took the cross for our sin and shame 
 Our God You will never fail 
 See the lost in return, swing the doors ever wider 
 See the tide, as it turns, love and mercy is on the rise 
 As the world folds into Your light, all creation will see Your light 
 Hear the sound of freedom rise as our song breaks the silence 
 Echoing the angel cry, let us lift up Your holy Name 
 Hereafter to sing Your praise, forever and ever 
 We will hold, we will love, we will fall in surrender 
 We will rise, we will run, we will live to declare Your Name 
 Forever to bring You praise, forever we'll lift up Your Name 
 The universe on its knees, see the stars in surrender 
 God above kings and queens, every idol will bend and break 
 But our God You will never fail, forever and ever 
 We will hold, we will love, we will fall in surrender 
 We will rise, we will run, we will live to declare Your Name 
 Forever to bring You praise 
 We will hold, we will love, we will fall in surrender 
 We will rise, we will run, we will live to declare Your Name 
 Forever to bring You praise, forever we'll lift up Your Name 
 Swing the doors wider, sound the praise louder 
 All our hearts cry out, for the glory of Your Name 
 Our God You will never fail 
 Lift the Name higher, shine the light brighter 
 All the earth cry out for the glory of Your Name 
 Our God You will never fail 
 We will hold, we will love, we will fall in surrender 
 We will rise, we will run, we will live to declare Your Name 
 Forever to bring You praise 
 Swing the doors wider, sound the praise louder 
 All our hearts cry out, for the glory of Your Name 
 Our God You will never fail 
 Lift the Name higher, shine the light brighter 
 All the earth cry out for the glory of Your Name 
 Our God You will never fail, forever we'll lift up Your Name

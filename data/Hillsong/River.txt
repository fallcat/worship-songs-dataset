I lift my eyes to Your throne 
 Lord as I lose myself in You 
 The song in my heart will be 
 Your alone 
 My treasure is in the Cross 
 Jesus I love to meet You There 
 I hunger and thirst for You 
 Now flood my soul 
 River of Love 
 River of Healing 
 Holly Spirit flow 
 River of Grace 
 River of Mercy flow 
 River of Peace 
 River of Promise 
 Holy Spirit flow 
 River of Joy 
 River of Blessing flow

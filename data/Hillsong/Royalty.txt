God made me who I'm meant to be 
 He loves me just the way I am 
 God made me who I'm meant to be 
 His dream for me is so amazing 
 And for this simple reason I am happy to be me 
 Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh, My God watches over me 
 Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh, I feel like royalty 
 And for this simple reason I am happy to be me

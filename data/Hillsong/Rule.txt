Be the crown in the light and sound 
 Be the fire burning inside out 
 Be the love casting out of fear 
 Let your name move the atmosphere 
 Love like the skies are wide 
 Crashing down to bring the world to life 
 Hope came dancing on an empty grave 
 Death has lost its rule to the King of grace 
 Oh ho ho ho ho, oh oh oh 
 Be the crown in the light and sound 
 Be the fire burning inside out 
 Be the love casting out of fear 
 Let your name move the atmosphere 
 Oh ho ho ho ho, oh oh oh 
 And we owe it all to Jesus 
 Sin and all the shame deleted 
 Death and all the chains defeated 
 And the light we see its Jesus 
 And the name we see is freedom 
 And the sound we know 
 Knows no fear 
 Your love through the atmosphere

You were God from the outset 
 Powerful and creative 
 You had saw us here before 
 You called all the stars and the earth to existence 
 You are God, You are Holy 
 History's Your story 
 You who was and is and forever will be 
 God we live for Your glory 
 So we will run altogether our hearts aflame 
 Like a fire that can't be tamed 
 Our God all glory to Your name, Jesus 
 You are God You are freedom 
 You're alive now within us 
 You who saw us here before 
 You conquered the grave 
 And delivered on the promise 
 So we will run altogether our hearts aflame 
 With a fire that can't be tamed 
 Our God all glory to Your name 
 We will run our surrender to bring You fame 
 Our desire that You be praised 
 Our God all glory to Your name, Jesus

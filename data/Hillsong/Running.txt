Ready at the line looking out 
 Looking out to all that's ahead 
 When every heart 
 Confesses Your Name 
 We're pressing on towards that day 
 We're never gonna stop 
 We're never gonna stop 
 Letting go of every mistake 
 Throwing off the chains of restraint 
 All that will remain 
 A passion for Your Name 
 Burning as we run this race 
 We're never gonna stop 
 We're never gonna stop 
 We're never gonna stop 
 We're never gonna stop 
 We are running 
 Chasing after all that You are 
 We are running 
 'Cause all that You are 
 Is all that we want now 
 Every stride is taken in faith 
 Every step compelled by Your grace 
 We're taking up our cross 
 No matter what the cost 
 We give it all to go Your way 
 We're never gonna stop 
 We're never gonna stop 
 Onwards we draw towards Your light 
 Desperate we seek 
 To know You more and more 
 Further we look beyond ourselves 
 To Your love 
 To Your love

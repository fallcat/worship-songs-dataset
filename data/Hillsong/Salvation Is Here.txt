God above all the world in motion 
 God above all my hopes and fears 
 I don't care what the world throws at me now 
 It's gonna be all right 
 Hear the sound of the generations 
 Making loud our freedom song 
 All in all that the world would know Your name 
 It's gonna be all right 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 Salvation is here 
 God above all the world in motion 
 God above all my hopes and fears 
 I don't care what the world throws at me now 
 It's gonna be all right 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 Salvation is here 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and He lives in me 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation that died just to set me free 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and He lives in me 
 Salvation is here 
 Cause You are alive and You live in me 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and it lives in me 
 Salvation is here 
 Savation is here that died just to set me free 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and it lives in me 
 Cause You are alive and You live in me 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and it lives in me 
 Salvation is here 
 Savation is here that died just to set me free 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and it lives in me 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 Salvation is here 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 Salvation is here

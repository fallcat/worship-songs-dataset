(Words and music Geoff Bullock) 
 Salvation! 
 Your grace has set me free 
 Delivered, saved and sanctified 
 Redeemed, forgiven, justified 
 Salvation! 
 Your grace has rescued me 
 I've come to put my trust in the Lord 
 Salvation! 
 Your blood it covers me 
 Renewed and raised and purified 
 Baptised, restored and glorified 
 Salvation! 
 Your Word transforming me 
 I've come to put my trust in the Lord 
 I'm walking step by step 
 I'm reading line by line 
 Faith to faith I'm praying all the time 
 I'm singing praise Your Name 
 I know I'm not the same 
 Heaven opens, Spirit falls 
 I'm saved in Jesus' Name

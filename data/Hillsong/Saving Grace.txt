Night and day I seek Your face 
 Long for You in the secret place 
 All I want in this life 
 Is to truly know you more... 
 As the waters cover the sea, 
 So Your love covers me 
 Guiding me on, 
 Roads unknown 
 I trust in You alone 
 My Saving Grace 
 My endless love 
 Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You 
 My one desire 
 My only truth 
 Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with you 
 And I will rise on wings of eagles 
 Soaring high above all my fears 
 I rest in Your open arms of love

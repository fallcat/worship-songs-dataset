A Saviour on a hill dying for my shame 
 Could this be true? 
 Defies the world I see 
 Yet this is all my heart was longing for 
 To know You my Lord 
 To know You Lord 
 You deserve 
 You deserve 
 You deserve all the praise 
 The heavens wept for You 
 The earth cried out "Could He be the One?" 
 For You so loved the world 
 You gave Your only Son to say 
 I love you so 
 Oh how I love You so 
 Hallelujah to the King 
 Hallelujah we will sing forever 
 And all humanity 
 Aches to find this beautiful love You give 
 We come to You again 
 To offer up our lives 
 To worship You alone 
 To worship You alone

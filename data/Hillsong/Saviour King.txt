And now the weak say I have strength 
 By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead 
 And now the poor stand and confess 
 That my portion is You and I'm more than blessed 
 Let now our hearts burn with a flame 
 A fire consuming all for Your Son's Holy Name 
 And with the heavens we declare 
 You are our King 
 We love You Lord, we worship You 
 You are our God, You alone are good 
 You asked Your Son to carry this 
 The heavy cross, our weight of sin 
 I love You Lord, I worship You 
 Hope which was lost, now stands renewed 
 I give my life to honor this 
 The love of Christ, the Saviour King 
 Let now Your church shine as Your bride 
 That You saw in Your heart as You offered up Your life 
 Let now the lost be welcomed home 
 By the saved and redeemed those adopted as Your own 
 I give my life to honor this 
 The love of Christ, the Saviour King

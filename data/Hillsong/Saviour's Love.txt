Jesus, I surrender my hope and my plans 
 I place my dreams in Your house, in Your hand 
 'Cause I know who I am in You, no shadow of doubt 
 'Cause it's the life You gave and the life You give 
 It's my Saviour's love for me, so I live my life 
 And all the world will know, will know 
 It's my Saviour's love, it's my Saviour's love 
 It's my Saviour's love for me 
 Jesus, now I'm living all the dreams of my heart 
 I never knew life could be like this, Your faithfulness 
 'Cause I know who I am in You, no shadow of doubt 
 'Cause it's the life You gave and the life You give 
 It's my Saviour's love for me, so I live my life 
 And all the world will know, will know 
 It's my Saviour's love, It's my Saviour's love 
 It's my Saviour's love for me 
 Holy is the, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the, Holy is the Lord 
 It's my Saviour's love, it's my Saviour's love 
 It's my Saviour's love 
 It's my Saviour's love, it's my Saviour's love 
 It's my Saviour's love 
 It's my Saviour's love, it's my Saviour's love 
 It's my Saviour's love, for me

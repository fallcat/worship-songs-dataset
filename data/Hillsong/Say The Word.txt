Say the word and there is light 
 Say the word and dead bones rise 
 Every start and end hangs on Your voice 
 For Your word never returns void 
 Written in a billion skies 
 Speaking to this heart of mine 
 All that I am with all creation 
 Hanging on every word that You've spoken 
 And it will not be shaken 
 Clinging for life to all Your promise 
 Hanging on every word that You say 
 It will remain 
 And my soul will hang on every word You say 
 Word made flesh You wrote in grace 
 Promise kept through cross and grave 
 Over words of stone You spelled out love 
 And when You say it is done 
 It is done 
 Written in a billion skies 
 Speaking to this heart of mine 
 All that I am with all creation 
 Hanging on every word that You've spoken 
 And it will not be shaken 
 Clinging for life to all Your promise 
 Hanging on every word that You say 
 It will remain 
 And my soul will hang on every word You say 
 'Cause I know Your word will never ever fail 
 And my soul will hang on every word You say

Grace, what have You done? 
 Murdered for me on that cross 
 Accused in absence of wrong 
 My sin washed away in Your blood 
 Too much to make sense of it all 
 I know that Your love breaks my fall 
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place 
 So my soul will live 
 Oh to be like You 
 Give all I have just to know You 
 Jesus, there's no one besides You 
 Forever the hope in my heart 
 Death, where is your sting? 
 Your power is as dead as my sin 
 The cross has taught me to live 
 And mercy, my heart now to sing 
 The day and its trouble shall come 
 I know that Your strength is enough 
 The scandal of grace, You died in my place 
 So my soul will live 
 Oh to be like You 
 Give all I have just to know You 
 Jesus, there's no one besides You 
 Forever the hope in my heart 
 (x2) 
 And it's all, because of You, Jesus 
 It's all, because of You, Jesus 
 It's all, because of Your love 
 And my soul will live 
 Oh to be like You 
 Give all I have just to know You 
 Jesus, there's no one besides You 
 Forever the hope in my heart 
 (x2)

Search my heart 
 And search my soul 
 There is nothing else 
 That I want more 
 Shine Your light 
 And show Your face 
 In my life 
 Lord have Your way 
 So with all my heart and all my soul 
 With all I am, Lord, I will follow You 
 You took the cross, You took my shame 
 Restored my life, now I live to worship You 
 Hear my cry 
 And hear my prayer 
 Draw me close 
 I know you're near 
 Without You I am nothing

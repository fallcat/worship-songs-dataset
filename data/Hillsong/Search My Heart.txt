Search my heart and search my soul 
 There is nothing else that I want more 
 Shine Your light and show Your face 
 In my life, Lord, have Your way, have Your way 
 Hear my cry and hear my prayer 
 Draw me close, I know You're near 
 Give me strength and give me grace 
 To walk with You, Lord, all my days 
 So with all my heart and all my soul 
 With all I am, Lord, I will follow You 
 You took the cross, You took my shame 
 Restored my life, now I live to worship You 
 Search my heart and search my soul 
 There is nothing else that I want more 
 With all my heart and all my soul 
 With all I am, Lord, I will follow You 
 You took the cross, You took my shame 
 Restored my life, Lord, I will follow You 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 With all my heart and all my soul 
 With all I am, Lord, I will follow You 
 You took the cross, You took my shame 
 Restored my life, Lord, I will follow You 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Without You I am nothing 
 Search my heart and search my soul

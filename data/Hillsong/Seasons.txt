Like the frost on a rose 
 Winter comes for us all 
 Oh how nature acquaints us 
 With the nature of patience 
 Like a seed in the snow 
 I've been buried to grow 
 For Your promise is loyal 
 From seed to sequoia 
 I know 
 Though the winter is long even richer 
 The harvest it brings 
 Though my waiting prolongs even greater 
 Your promise for me like a seed 
 I believe that my season will come 
 Lord I think of Your love 
 Like the low winter sun 
 As I gaze I am blinded 
 In the light of Your brightness 
 Like a fire to the snow 
 I'm renewed in Your warmth 
 Melt the ice of this wild soul 
 Till the barren is beautiful 
 I know 
 Though the winter is long even richer 
 The harvest it brings 
 Though my waiting prolongs even greater 
 Your promise for me like a seed 
 I believe that my season will come 
 I can see the promise 
 I can see the future 
 You're the God of seasons 
 I'm just in the winter 
 If all I know of harvest 
 Is that it's worth my patience 
 Then if You're not done working 
 God I'm not done waiting 
 You can see my promise 
 Even in the winter 
 Cause You're the God of greatness 
 Even in a manger 
 For all I know of seasons 
 Is that You take Your time 
 You could have saved us in a second 
 Instead You sent a child 
 Though the winter is long even richer 
 The harvest it brings 
 Though my waiting prolongs even greater 
 Your promise for me like a seed 
 I believe that my season will come 
 And when I finally see my tree 
 Still I believe there's a season to come 
 Like a seed You were sown 
 For the sake of us all 
 From Bethlehem's soil 
 Grew Calvary's sequoia

You called my name, reached out your hand, 
 Restored my life, and I was redeemed, 
 The moment you entered my life, 
 Amazing grace, Christ gave that day, 
 My life was changed, 
 Went from my shoulders, fell the weight of my sin 
 So it's with everything I am, 
 I reach out for your hand, 
 The hope that changed a second chance I've gained, 
 On you I throw my life, casting all my fears aside, 
 How could greater love than this, ever possibly exist 
 Consume my thoughts, as I rest in you, 
 I'm now in love, with a Saviour, 
 Bearing the marks of his love 
 So I wait upon you now, 
 With my hands released to you, 
 Where a little faiths enough, 
 To see mountains lift and move, 
 Yeah and I wait upon you now, 
 Dedicated to your will, 
 To this love that will remain, 
 A love that never fails

It's You I can't escape 
 Your love has me surrounded 
 In every way 
 So I surrender now 
 And raise my hands 
 All I want is You (All I want is You) 
 You have carried me 
 Through many storms 
 And many raging seas 
 You rescue me 
 In my hour of need 
 And all I want is You (All I want is You) 
 I'm coming to You 
 For the love that I need 
 I'm desperate for Your touch 
 I'm seeking You 
 I'm seeking You 
 You're always by my side 
 My closest friend 
 In You I can rely 
 You're with me 
 Every moment of my life 
 All I want is You (All I want is You)

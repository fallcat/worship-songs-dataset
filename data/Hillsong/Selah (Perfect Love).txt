Cover me 
 In stillness You are welcome here 
 Comfort me 
 And teach me Lord to know Your peace 
 I look to the cross 
 Lord, let me see Your love anew 
 There I find peace 
 There I find peace again 
 Draw me near 
 Into Your arms the strength I know 
 Lift my soul 
 To rest in You my only hope 
 The Lord, my light and my salvation 
 In whom then shall I be afraid 
 I'll never be the same 
 I'll never be the same again 
 In You I find peace again

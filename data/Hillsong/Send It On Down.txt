Send it on down. Send it on down. 
 Lord, let the Holy Ghost come on down. 
 Send it on down. Send it on down. 
 Lord, let the Holy Ghost come on down. 
 (Repeat 1st time only) 
 Lord we're your children, and we are 
 Asking, for You to send your fire! 
 Our hearts are hungry, our spirits are thirsty... 
 We need to feel the power! 
 Just like the prophet, said it would be, 
 In the last days an outpouring we'd see. 
 Yes, we are waiting... Anticipating, 
 Lord, won't You send the Holy Ghost now? 
 Heavenly Father, hear our call. 
 Let Your Holy Spirit fall 
 Send down the power, 
 Let it fall like rain; 
 As we lift our praises to Your name!

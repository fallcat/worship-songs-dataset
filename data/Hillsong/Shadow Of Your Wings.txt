My spirit rests in You 
 You're all I know 
 Embrace and touch me 
 Like a child 
 I'm safe in You 
 You're my shelter through it all 
 You're my refuge and my strength 
 Lord I hide in the shadow of Your wings 
 My Lord, You're faithful 
 You supply all good things 
 You know completely 
 All my thoughts 
 My deepest needs

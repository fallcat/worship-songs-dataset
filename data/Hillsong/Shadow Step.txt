Light up the way of Your heart 
 Move me like You do the mountains 
 Move me like You do the wind 
 And I'll chase Your voice through the dark 
 Fix my eyes on the unexpected 
 In the wonder of Your shadow step 
 So take another step 
 You met me at the sinners table 
 I found You waiting by the well, unexpected 
 You are always there 
 Tracing all my steps 
 Light up the way of Your heart 
 Move me like You do the mountains 
 Move me like You do the wind 
 And I'll chase Your voice through the dark 
 Fix my eyes on the unexpected 
 In the wonder of Your shadow step 
 So take another step 
 You never left the lost forsaken 
 Your mercy paves the road ahead, unexpected 
 You are always good 
 You are always good 
 Light up the way of Your heart 
 Move me like You do the mountains 
 Move me like You do the wind 
 And I'll chase Your voice through the dark 
 Fix my eyes on the unexpected 
 In the wonder of Your shadow step 
 And I won't be afraid 
 In every way, You never fail 
 So have Your way, here God 
 And I'll sing Your praise 
 Fix my heart to Yours 
 Ready for the unexpected 
 Ready for what You will do next 
 I can't explain Your heart 
 Or dare to trace-out all You are 
 But when I think about the road You took for love 
 I know Your grace will stay the path 
 Light up the way of Your heart 
 Move me like You do the mountains 
 Move me like You do the wind 
 And I'll chase Your voice through the dark 
 Fix my eyes on the unexpected 
 In the wonder of Your shadow step 
 And I won't be afraid 
 In every way, You never fail 
 So have Your way, here God 
 And I'll sing Your praise 
 Fix my heart to Yours 
 Ready for the unexpected 
 Ready for what You will do next 
 So take another step

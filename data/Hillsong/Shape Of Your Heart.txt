There's a light hanging over me 
 There's a beam running way down 
 Turning sorrow to ecstasy 
 As the dust comes to life 
 See the shape of your heart 
 Where the margins collide 
 There's a life hanging over me, over me 
 Where your love crossed the lines 
 You run deep like the wildest heavens 
 You run deep like the wild in me 
 There's a love hanging over me 
 There's a beam running way out 
 In the shadow of mystery, where my soul comes alive 
 See the shape of your heart, where the margins collide 
 There a life hanging over me, over me 
 Where your love crossed the lines 
 You run deep like the wildest heavens 
 You run deep like the wild in me 
 You run wide like the four horizons 
 You run wide enough to cover me 
 How I love you Jesus 
 (I will worship you, I will worship you Jesus) 
 See the shape of your heart, where the margins collide 
 There a life hanging over me, over me 
 Where your love crossed the lines 
 You run deep like the wildest heavens 
 You run deep like the wild in me 
 You run wide like the four horizons 
 You run wide enough to cover me 
 There's a cross hanging over me 
 There's a fire burning inside out 
 As the word comes to life in me 
 In the shape of your heart

Look across the world 
 And let us shine for you, Lord 
 The whole world is yours 
 And I want to live for you 
 One thing I know 
 Is that you've changed my life 
 I give you my all 
 All you are is good 
 Give you my heart 
 God it's only you I seek 
 Give you my praise 
 'Cause I believe in you 
 Look across the world 
 And let us shine for you, Lord 
 The whole world is yours 
 And I want to live for you, O God 
 All that I know 
 Is that you've changed my life 
 I give you my all 
 And all you are is good 
 Carry the lost 
 Make my prayer in this life real 
 Carry my cross 
 Hold on 'til I see you 
 Look across the world 
 And let us shine for you, Lord 
 The whole world is yours 
 And I want to live for you, O God 
 And I want to live 
 I want to love you more 
 I want to be used 
 Father in all of the world 
 May your word be heard 
 May it stay on my lips 
 To live what I speak 
 Until your kingdom come 
 Look across the world 
 And let us shine for you 
 And let us shine for you 
 Look across the world 
 And let us shine for you, Lord 
 The whole world is yours 
 And I want to live for you 
 Look across the world 
 And let us shine for you, Lord 
 The whole world is yours 
 And I want to live for you 
 And I want to live for you 
 And I want to live for you

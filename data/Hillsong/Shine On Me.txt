I'm standing here Lord 
 Knowing I'm found by You 
 Here in the stillness 
 Knowing that You are God 
 Your surrounds me 
 Taking away all fear 
 In my salvation 
 Jesus I know that You're here with me 
 So let Your eyes look for me 
 And let Your face shine on me 
 And may You hear my heart song 
 I just want to worship You 
 I just want to worship You 
 I just want to worship You

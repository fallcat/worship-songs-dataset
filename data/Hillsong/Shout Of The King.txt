 I'll give You praise till I overcome 
 I give You praise when the sun is shining 
 I give You praise in the dark of night 
 I give You praise when the battle rages 
 I give You praise till it works out right 
 The shout of the King is among us 
 God lives here in our praises 
 The shout of the King is among us 
 Praise Him

 Praise Him in everything

My Jesus, my Saviour 
 Lord, there is none like you 
 All of my days I want to praise 
 The wonders of your might love. 
 My comfort, my shelter 
 Tower of refuge and strength 
 Let every breath, all that I am 
 Never cease to worship you. 
 Shout to the Lord 
 All the earth, let us sing 
 Power and majesty 
 Praise to the king. 
 Mountains bow down 
 And the seas will roar 
 At the sound of your name. 
 I sing for joy 
 At the work of your hands 
 Forever I'll love you 
 Forever I'll stand. 
 Nothing compares 
 To the promise I have in you

Some say You're just a good man 
 Some say You were kind 
 Some say You are in the grave 
 But I say You're alive 
 Some say You're just a prophet 
 Some say You were wise 
 Some say You were just a man 
 But I say You are God 
 You are my God 
 I will shout Your fame to all the earth 
 I will lift Your name on high 
 And the world will know Your greatness 
 You are my God, I will shout Your fame 
 I know You're the Messiah 
 You gave Your life for me 
 And I know You're the only way 
 Jesus You are God 
 You are my God 
 I will shout Your fame to all the earth 
 I will lift Your name on high 
 I will show the world Your greatness 
 You are my God, Jesus 
 I will shout Your fame to all the earth 
 I will lift Your name on high 
 I will show the world Your goodness 
 As I live a life that shouts Your fame 
 As I live a life that shouts Your fame 
 Jesus, I decide to live 
 Live a life that shouts Your fame 
 Shout Your fame 
 Shout Your fame 
 Shout Your fame 
 Shout Your fame 
 Shout Your fame 
 Shout Your fame 
 Shout Your fame 
 Shout Your fame

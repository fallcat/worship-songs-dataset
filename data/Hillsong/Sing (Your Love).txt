It used to be darkness 
 Without You 
 I lived my life in blindness 
 Now I am found 
 And I'll sing, I'll sing, I love You so 
 And I'll sing 
 Because the world can't take away 
 Your love 
 Found me in weakness 
 Broken 
 You came to me in kindness 
 And now I live 
 And I'll sing, I'll sing, I love You so 
 And I'll sing 
 Because the world can't take away 
 Your love 
 And I'll sing, sing, I love You so 
 And I'll sing 
 Because the world can't take away 
 Your love 
 And I'll give my life for You Lord 
 For all You've done 
 I'll give my life for You Lord 
 For all You've done 
 I'll give my life for You Lord 
 For all You've done 
 I'll give my life for You Lord 
 For all You've done 
 I'll give my life for You Lord 
 For all You've done 
 I'll give my life for You Lord 
 For all You've done 
 I'll give my life for You Lord 
 And I'll sing, I'll sing, I love You so 
 And I'll sing 
 Because the world can't take away 
 Your love 
 And I'll sing, I'll sing, I love You so 
 And I'll sing 
 Because the world can't take away 
 Your love

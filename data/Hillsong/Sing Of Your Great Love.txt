All that is within me Lord 
 Will bless Your Holy name 
 I live my life to worship You alone 
 You brought me out of darkness 
 And into Your glorious light 
 Forever I will sing of Your great love 
 Forever I will sing of Your great love 
 I love to see You glorified 
 To see You lifted high 
 I yearn to see all nations bow their knees 
 It's You alone Lord Jesus 
 Who can cause the coldest heart 
 To find Your love and everlasting peace 
 To find Your love and everlasting peace 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 I love to see You glorified 
 To see You lifted high 
 I yearn to see all nations bow their knees 
 It's You alone Lord Jesus 
 Who can cause the coldest heart 
 To find Your love and everlasting peace 
 To find Your love and everlasting peace 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Your trumpet will sound 
 And all heavens will know 
 That the time has finally come 
 For the bride to take Her place 
 And we'll hear the angels sing 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord

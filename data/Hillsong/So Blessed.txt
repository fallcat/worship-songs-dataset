More than I could hope or dream of, 
 You want to pour your favour on me. 
 One day in the house of God is, 
 Better than a thousand days in the world. 
 So blessed I can't contain it. So much I gotta give it away. 
 Your love has taught me to live now. 
 You are more than enough for me. 
 Lord, You are more than enough for me 
 Lord, You are more than enough for me 
 Lord, You are more than enough for me 
 Lord, You are more than enough for me

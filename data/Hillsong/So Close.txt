I'm so secure 
 You're here with me. 
 You stay the same 
 Your love remains 
 Here in my heart. 
 So close I believe 
 You're holding me now, 
 In Your hands I belong. 
 You'll never let me go; 
 So close I believe 
 You're holding me now 
 In Your hands I belong, 
 You'll never let me go. 
 You gave Your life 
 And Your endless love. 
 You set me free 
 And show the way 
 Now I am found 
 All along You were beside me 
 Even when I couldn't tell 
 And through the years 
 You showed me more of You 
 More of You

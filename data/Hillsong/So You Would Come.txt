Before the world began 
 You were on His mind 
 And every tear you cry 
 Is precious in His eyes 
 Because of His great love 
 He gave His only Son 
 Everything was done 
 So you would come 
 Nothing you can do 
 Could make Him love you more 
 And nothing that you've done 
 Could make Him close the door 
 Because of His great love 
 He gave His only Son 
 Everything was done 
 So you would come 
 Come to the Father 
 Though your gift is small 
 Broken hearts, broken lives 
 He will take them all 
 The power of the Word 
 The power of His blood 
 Everything was done 
 So you would come

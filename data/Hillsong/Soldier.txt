Can't nobody stop me now 
 'Cause I'm part of the army now 
 Praise the LORD is what I wanna shout 
 Even in a crowd I'm gonna sing it Loud 
 You can see what you want to see 
 But I know what he's done for me 
 Every day I can feel his power 
 'Cause the spirit of the Lord 
 He lifts me higher 
 All the world, can't stop, can't stop him 
 All the world, can't stop, can't stop him now 
 My God is the strongest tower 
 Turn to him in the scary hour 
 Even when it gets harder now 
 All I wanna do is just praise him louder 
 Keep singing till my voice run out 
 Keep running till he lifts me out 
 Keep singing it 'cause I can't stop 
 Oh, I can't stop 
 You got the give yourself up 
 You got to lose your pride 
 You got to see it different 
 Open up your spiritual eyes 
 The devil wants you beaten 
 He wants you lying, cheating 
 But that won't last much longer 
 My dad is bigger, stronger

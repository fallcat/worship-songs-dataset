It is not a human right 
 To stare not fight 
 While broken nations dream 
 Open up our eyes, so blind 
 That we might find 
 The Mercy for the need 
 Singin' Hey Now 
 Fill our hearts with your compassion 
 Hey Now 
 As we hold to our confession 
 Yeah 
 It is not too far a cry 
 To much to try 
 To help the least of these 
 Politics will not decide 
 If we should rise 
 And be your hands and feet 
 Singing Hey Now 
 Fill our hearts with your compassion 
 Hey Now 
 As we hold to our confession 
 Whoa-oh-oh, 
 God be the solution 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 We will be Your hands and be Your feet. 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Higher than a circumstance 
 Your promise stands 
 Your love for all to see 
 Higher than protest line and dollar signs 
 Your love is all we need 
 Only you can mend the broken heart 
 And cause the blind to see 
 Erase complete the sinners past 
 And set the captives free 
 Only you can take the widows cry 
 And cause her heart to sing 
 Be a father to the fatherless 
 Our savior and our king 
 We will be your hands, we will be your feet 
 We will run this race 
 On the darkest place, we will be your light 
 We will be your light 
 We will be your hands, we will be your feet 
 We will run this race for the least of these 
 In the darkest place, we will be your light 
 We will be your light (we'll say/sing?) 
 We will run we will run 
 We will (run with the solution?) (2x) 
 We will be your hands we will be your feet 
 We will run this race for the least of these 
 In the darkest place we will be your light 
 We will be your light

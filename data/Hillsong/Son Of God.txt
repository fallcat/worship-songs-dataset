Hold my hand and walk with me 
 You're the light that makes me see 
 And on this path my soul you lead 
 Oh my shepherd, walk with me 
 I need You more than breath 
 You're my hope, in You I live 
 And Angels worship at Your throne 
 Power and Glory to You alone 
 My Savior 
 Glorious One 
 My Redeemer 
 Living in my heart 
 Now and forever 
 Your Kingdom come 
 Oh Jesus, Son of God 
 Jesus, Son of God 
 I need You more than breath 
 You're my hope, in You I live 
 And Angels worship at Your throne 
 Power and Glory to You alone 
 My Savior 
 Glorious One 
 My Redeemer 
 Living in my heart 
 Now and forever 
 Your Kingdom come 
 Oh Jesus, Son of God 
 Oh Jesus, Son of God 
 Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Holy is The Lamb of God 
 Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Worthy is The Lamb of God 
 Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Holy is The Lamb of God 
 Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Worthy is The Lamb of God 
 My Savior 
 Glorious One 
 Oh, you are my Redeemer 
 Living in my heart 
 Now and forever 
 Your Kingdom come 
 Oh Jesus, Son of God 
 Jesus, Son of God 
 Jesus, Son of God

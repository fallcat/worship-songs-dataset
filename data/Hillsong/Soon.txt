Soon and very soon 
 My King is coming 
 Robed in righteousness and crowned with love 
 When I see Him 
 I shall be made like Him 
 Soon and very soon 
 Soon and very soon 
 I'll be going 
 To the place He has prepared for me 
 There my sin erased 
 My shame forgotten 
 Soon and very soon 
 I will be with the One I love 
 With unveiled face I'll see Him 
 There my soul will be satisfied 
 Soon and very soon 
 Soon and very soon 
 See the procession 
 The angels and the elders 'round the throne 
 At His feet I'll lay my crowns My worship 
 Soon and very soon 
 I will be with the One I love 
 With unveiled face I'll see Him 
 There my soul will be satisfied 
 Soon and very soon 
 Though I have not seen Him 
 My heart knows Him well 
 Jesus Christ the Lamb 
 The Lord of heaven 
 I will be with the One I love 
 With unveiled face I'll see Him 
 There my soul will be satisfied 
 Soon and very soon 
 Soon and very soon

Sovereign hands 
 Nailed to a humble cross 
 Scars You bear 
 Speak of Your redeeming love 
 No wonder I call You the Saviour 
 No wonder I'm singing 
 God of all the heavens 
 Now and till forever 
 High above the universe 
 God of our redemption 
 God of my surrender 
 The glory is Yours 
 Sovereign God 
 Laying down a holy life 
 Heaven's Son 
 Willing to be crucified 
 Holy 
 Holy 
 Holy Lord 
 Open hands 
 Given to a sovereign cause 
 All I have 
 God will be forever Yours

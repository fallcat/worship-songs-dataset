Fate 
 Holds nothing on the providence I know 
 No longer bound to things of wood and stone 
 When all I had to offer was my worst 
 You saw my heavy heart and loved me first 
 Your beauty staring down my brokenness 
 You chose to throw Your heart into the mess 
 Compassion crashing down upon my debt You were there 
 All this time 
 Like a river running through my failure 
 You carried me all this time 
 Like the splinters buried in 
 Your shoulders You carry me now 
 Hallelujah 
 If ever now my heart cries hallelujah 
 If ever now in the wonder of Your grace 
 A thousand times a thousand years my soul 
 Will say 
 Grace 
 You saw the crushing weight my flesh deserved 
 You kneeled and wrote forgiveness in the dirt 
 And one by one the stones fell where they lay 
 As one by one my accusers walked away 
 With nothing left to throw they made a cross 
 And knowing only love could count the cost 
 You were there 
 All this time 
 Like a river running through my failure 
 You carried me all this time 
 Like the splinters buried in 
 Your shoulders Your love carried all my shame 
 Jesus how my soul will praise You 
 You carried me all this way 
 Like a diamond in the scars upon 
 Your crown You carry me now 
 Hallelujah 
 If ever now my heart cries hallelujah 
 If ever now in the wonder of Your grace 
 A thousand times a thousand years 
 My soul will say 
 Hallelujah 
 Forever now in the greatness of my Saviour 
 Forever now in the brightness of Your Name 
 Jesus on this rock I'll sing Your praise

Better than all this world 
 Better than all I know 
 Better than life itself 
 Your love is 
 All that I have is Yours 
 All that I'm living for 
 All that I need is You Lord 
 You alone are better than life 
 Than anything in this world 
 You alone are all I want 
 In everything You are good 
 I stand in awe of all that You are 
 I stand in awe of You 
 Everything unto You 
 Everything held by You 
 All of our hope is in You Jesus 
 Nothing compares to You 
 Nothing will take Your place 
 All of our trust is in You Lord 
 All of my heart 
 All that I am 
 Worship 
 Jesus

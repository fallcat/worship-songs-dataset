Who spoke the Earth and sky to form 
 Who sets the sun and calls the dawn 
 Who breathed me out of dust to life 
 With the will to trust or run and hide 
 I will stay should the world by me fold 
 Lift up Your name as the darkness falls 
 I will wait and hold fast to Your word 
 Heart on Your heart and my eyes on You 
 Who loved me through my rebel way 
 Who chose to carry all my shame 
 Who breaths in me with endless life 
 The king of glory Jesus Christ 
 I will stay should the world by me fold 
 Lift up Your name as the darkness falls 
 I will wait and hold fast to Your word 
 Heart on Your heart and my eyes on You 
 God of wonder and God of grace 
 Let my soul stand always to praise You 
 Fix my eyes on Your perfect way 
 And I'll never look back 
 I will stay should the world by me fold 
 Lift up Your name as the darkness falls 
 I will wait and hold fast to Your word 
 Heart on Your heart and my eyes on You 
 Who lifts the poor and heals the blind 
 Who trampled death for all mankind 
 Who stands for all with arms stretched wide 
 My King forever Jesus Christ

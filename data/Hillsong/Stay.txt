Stay 
 Words and Music by: Luke Munns 
 I am not the same 
 I've been called by name 
 You gave me new life 
 I cannot express how it feels 
 Here in your arms 
 Here I'll stay forever 
 I have found your love 
 Here I'll stay forever 
 Hold me in your arms 
 Jesus take my hand 
 Lead me on your path 
 I give you my life 
 I cannot express how it feels 
 Here in your arms 
 Here I'll stay forever 
 Here I'll stay with you

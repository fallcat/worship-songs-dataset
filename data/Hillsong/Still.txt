Hide me now 
 Under Your wings 
 Cover me 
 Within Your mighty hand 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with you above the storm 
 Father, You are King over the flood 
 I will be still and know You are God 
 Find rest my soul 
 In Christ alone 
 Know His power 
 In quietness and trust

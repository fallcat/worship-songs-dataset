Tired of endless walking 
 Not knowing which way to go 
 I collapsed on a street called mercy 
 I was found in You 
 Throwing Your arms around me 
 You held me like I was Yours 
 Like You'd been there the whole time waiting 
 I was found in You 
 Wrapped up in scarlet kindness 
 You welcomed this sinner home 
 Now I breathe in the air of heaven 
 All I want is You 
 Keep me within Your shadow 
 Lord tether my heart to Yours 
 I want nothing without Your presence 
 All I want is You 
 You are all I want 
 You are all I need 
 Every breath I take 
 Is a breath to say 
 I am Yours now forever

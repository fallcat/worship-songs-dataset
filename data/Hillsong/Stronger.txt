There is love that came for us 
 Humbled to a sinner's cross you broke my shame and sinfuless you rose again victorious 
 Faithfulness none can deny through the strom and through the fire there is truth that sets me free Jesus Christ who lives in me 
 You are stronger you are stronger 
 Sin is broken you have saved me it is written Christ is risen Jesus you are Lord of all 
 No beginning and no end You're my hope and my defence you came to seek and save the lost you paid it all upon the cross 
 So let your name be lifted higher 
 Be lifted higher be lifted higher

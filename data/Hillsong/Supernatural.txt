These are the days when 
 We can see miracles 
 Your wonders everywhere 
 Here is my life Lord 
 You can use me 
 To show the world You care. 
 You made me, You saved me Lord 
 You called me, and gave me Jesus. 
 Supernatural, supernatural God 
 All things are possible 
 Supernatural, supernatural God 
 I'm gonna praise You. 
 You are my healer 
 And my salvation, thank you for your grace 
 Your name is higher 
 Than any other, greatly to be praised.

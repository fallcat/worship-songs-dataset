You broke the night like the sun 
 And healed my heart with Your great love 
 Any trouble I couldn't bear 
 You lifted me upon Your shoulders 
 Love that's stronger 
 Love that covers sin 
 And takes the weight of the world 
 I love You 
 All of my hope is in You 
 Jesus Christ take my life 
 Take all of me 
 You stand on mountain tops with me 
 With You I walk through the valleys 
 You gave Your only Son for me 
 Your grace is all I rely on 
 I love You so, and I give up my heart to say 
 I need You so, my everything

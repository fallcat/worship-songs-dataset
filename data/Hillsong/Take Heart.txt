There is a light, it burns brighter than the sun 
 He steals the night and casts no shadow 
 There is hope, should oceans rise and mountains fall 
 He never fails 
 So take heart 
 Let His love lead us through the night 
 Hold on to hope 
 And take courage again 
 In death by love the fallen world was overcome 
 He wears the scars of our freedom 
 In His name all our fears are swept away 
 He never fails 
 So take heart 
 Let His love lead us through the night 
 Hold on to hope 
 And take courage again 
 All our troubles and all our tears 
 God, our hope, He has overcome 
 All our failure and all our fear 
 God, our love, He has overcome 
 All our heartache and all our pain 
 God, our healer, He has overcome 
 All our burdens and all our shame 
 God, our freedom, He has overcome 
 All our troubles and all our tears 
 God, our hope, He has overcome 
 All our failures and all our fear 
 God, our love, He has overcome 
 God, our justice, God, our grace 
 God, our freedom, He has overcome 
 God, our refuge, God, our strength 
 God is with us, He has overcome

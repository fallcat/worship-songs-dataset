Maker of earth and sky 
 And everything before our eyes 
 Your word formed life and light 
 Within the crucible of time 
 The genesis of all mankind 
 Our lives a tapestry of grace 
 Your hand has weaved together 
 In You no thread will ever fray 
 This hope is ours forever 
 Your work of art a mystery 
 Beyond all earthly measure 
 Your love for us a masterpiece 
 Jesus our hope always 
 Hallelujah hallelujah 
 Author of grace divine 
 Love orchestrated in our lives 
 The cross of Calvary 
 The gift of God the centrepiece 
 Upon that cross You set us free 
 Lift our eyes towards the Son 
 Glorious You stand alone 
 Raised to life You've overcome 
 Holy is the Lord our God 
 Your love is unrivalled 
 Your glory spans eternity 
 Your word is final 
 The cross of Christ our victory 
 Every knee will bow at the Name of Jesus 
 For there is no name like the Name of Jesus

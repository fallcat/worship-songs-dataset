O taste and see 
 That the Lord is good 
 O taste and see 
 That the Lord is good 
 He is good to me 
 You've turned my mourning 
 Into dancing 
 Put off my rags and clothed me with gladness 
 And I will arise and I will praise you 
 I'll sing and not be silent 
 O Lord, My God 
 I will give thanks to you forever 
 O Lord, My God 
 I will give thanks to you 
 And I'll live only for you 
 And I'll lift these hands up to you 
 And I'll dance before you 
 I will shout it, I will shout it to you

Tear down the walls see the world 
 Is there something we have missed 
 Turn from ourselves 
 Look beyond 
 There is so much more than this 
 And I don't need to see it to believe it 
 I don't need to see it to believe it 
 'Cause I can't shake this 
 Fire deep inside my heart 
 Look to the skies hope arise 
 See His majesty revealed 
 More than this life there is love 
 There is hope and this is real 
 'Cause I don't need to see it to believe it 
 I don't need to see it to believe it 
 'Cause I can't shake this fire burning 
 Deep inside my heart 
 This life is Yours and hope is rising 
 As Your glory floods our hearts 
 Let love tear down these walls 
 That all creation would 
 Come back to You 
 It's all for You 
 Your Name is glorious 
 Glorious 
 Your love is changing us 
 Calling us 
 To worship in spirit and in truth 
 As all creation returns to You 
 Oh for all the sons and daughters 
 Who are walking in the darkness 
 You are calling us to lead them back to You 
 We will see Your spirit rising 
 As the lost come out of hiding 
 Every heart will see this hope we have in You 
 'Cause I don't need to see it to believe it 
 I don't need to see it to believe it 
 'Cause I can't shake this fire burning 
 Deep inside my heart 
 This life is Yours and hope is rising 
 As Your glory floods our hearts 
 Let love tear down these walls 
 That all creation would 
 Come back to You 
 It's all for You 
 Your Name is glorious 
 Glorious 
 Your love is changing us 
 Calling us 
 To worship in spirit and in truth 
 As all creation returns to You

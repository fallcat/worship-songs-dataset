Don't want to stand here and shout Your praise 
 And walk away and forget Your Name 
 I'll stand for you if it's all I do 
 Cause there is none that compare to You 
 Cause all I want in this lifetime is You 
 And all I want in this whole world is you 
 Tell the world that Jesus lives 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 Tell the world that he died for them 
 Tell the world that he lives again 
 No longer I but Christ in me 
 'Cause it's the truth that set me free 
 How could this world be a better place? 
 But by thy mercy and by thy grace 
 C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You 
 C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that Jesus lives 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 Tell the world that he died for them 
 Tell the world that he lives again 
 C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that 
 Tell the world that 
 C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that 
 Tell the world that 
 About You

Don't want to stand here and shout Your praise 
 And walk away and forget Your Name 
 I'll stand for You if it's all I do 
 'Cause there is none that compare to You 
 And all I want in this lifetime is You 
 And all I want in this whole world is You 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 Tell the world that Jesus lives 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 Tell the world that He died for them 
 Tell the world that He lives again 
 No longer I but Christ in me 
 'Cause it's the truth that set me free 
 How could this world be a better place? 
 But by Thy mercy and by Thy grace 
 'Cause all I want in this lifetime is You 
 And all I want in this whole world is You, You, You 
 Tell the world that Jesus lives 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 Tell the world that He died for them 
 Tell the world that He lives again 
 Tell the world that Jesus lives 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 Tell the world that He died for them 
 Tell the world that He lives again 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that Jesus lives 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 Tell the world that He died for them 
 Tell the world that He lives again 
 Tell the world that Jesus lives 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 Tell the world that He died for them 
 Tell the world that He lives again 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that 
 C'mon, c'mon, we'll tell the world about You 
 Tell the world that, tell the world that, about You

Grace that flows like a river 
 Washing over me 
 Fount of Heaven, love of Christ 
 Overflow in me 
 Thank You Jesus 
 You set me free 
 Christ my Savior 
 You rescued me 
 Take this life delivered 
 A vessel of Your love 
 Wholly now devoted 
 To see Your kingdom come 
 Thank You Jesus 
 You set me free 
 Christ my Savior 
 You rescued me 
 (x2) 
 You've given me life 
 You've opened my eyes 
 I love You Lord 
 I love You Lord 
 You've entered my heart 
 You've set me apart 
 I love You Lord 
 I love You Lord 
 (x4) 
 Thank You Jesus 
 You set me free 
 Christ my Savior 
 You rescued me 
 (x2)

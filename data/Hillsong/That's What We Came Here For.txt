We come into Your presence with singing 
 Come into Your presence with praise 
 Enter Your gates with thankful hearts 
 We are going to celebrate 
 All of heaven's waiting 
 Power is on its way 
 So we shout hallelujah 
 Lifting to You a mighty roar of praise 
 You deserve the highest praise 
 We can give and more 
 Lord, we give You our praise 
 That's what we came here for 
 You deserve the highest praise 
 We can give and more

Whoa, now's the time to change this world 
 Whoa, broken hearts will hear Your Word 
 Whoa, the cry of freedom fills the earth 
 Because of You we stand in hope 
 Whoa, take this stand don't be afraid 
 Whoa, break the chains of fear to fail 
 Whoa, Christ has brought the victory 
 Because of You we stand in hope 
 All You are is everything I need 
 We'll see the lost come home 
 And find their King 
 I want to be a light that shines for You 
 To see You lifted high in love and truth 
 Whoa, unified we hear the call 
 Whoa, to reach this city for You, Lord 
 Whoa, we can be the change for earth 
 Because of You we stand in hope

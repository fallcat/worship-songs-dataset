You are the difference in us 
 You've broken the past 
 And set us apart 
 You caused the darkness to end 
 You lifted our heads 
 To know you again 
 Lord you bring us to life 
 In you our hope will arise 
 We are found 
 There's nothing that can hold us down 
 With anything against us 
 We know your love will be the difference 
 Be the difference 
 You defied reason with love 
 Took the fall meant for us 
 You alone are enough 
 Though we were destined to fail 
 You opened the way 
 And broke every chain 
 Lord you bring us to life 
 In you our hope will arise 
 We are found 
 There's nothing that can hold us down 
 With anything against us 
 We know your love will be the difference 
 Be the difference 
 You give and take 
 Still we will go your way 
 All our fear is in the distance 
 We know your love will be the difference 
 Be the difference 
 You awaken our hearts 
 To you we owe what we are 
 You're the change in us 
 The change in us 
 We know 
 You awaken our hearts 
 To you we owe what we are 
 You're the change in us 
 The change in us 
 We know 
 We are found 
 There's nothing that can hold us down 
 With anything against us 
 We know your love will be the difference 
 Be the difference 
 You give and take 
 Still we will go your way 
 All our fear is in the distance 
 We know your love will be the difference 
 Be the difference

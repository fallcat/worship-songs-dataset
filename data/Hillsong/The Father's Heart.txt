When the walls close in around me 
 Let Your glory light the darkness of my night 
 When the suffering's all that I see 
 May I walk with You by faith and not by sight 
 On the throne of sweet surrender 
 I have nothing but to offer You my life 
 Greater love I have not found it 
 Oh by mercy You have eased this troubled mind 
 Open hearted I will search and I will find 
 Whoa 
 Sin is broken 
 The lost now chosen 
 The Father's heart 
 (x2) 
 Humble king You go before me 
 By Your grace I stand for everything that's true 
 Through Your Son I am made worthy 
 There's no other who can love me like You do 
 And forever I keep running back to You 
 Whoa 
 Sin is broken 
 The lost now chosen 
 The Father's heart 
 (x3) 
 Sin is broken 
 The lost now chosen 
 The father's heart 
 You reign 
 You reign in all the earth 
 Whoa 
 (x6)

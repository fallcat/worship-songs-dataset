You are the first and the last 
 Beginning and the end 
 The promise of wonders to come 
 The future is in your hands 
 Caught in the light 
 With all the earth we will sing 
 You are the author of love 
 Our freedom is in your name 
 Embracing the cross meant for us 
 And bought us to life again 
 Caught in the love 
 With all we are let us sing 
 God our hope 
 And our salvation 
 Worthy of all the praise 
 Be our light everlasting 
 Great is your name 
 Jesus the first and the last 
 Show us the way of your love 
 Lead us toward the truth 
 Stir up the fire in us 
 To live out this life for you 
 Caught in your name 
 Jesus forever we'll sing 
 Every heart 
 Every nation will hear the sound 
 As your light breaks through the darkness 
 And your name rings out 
 Every distant horizon will meet as one 
 Singing holy is your name 
 We sing holy is your name

The first Noel the angels did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep. 
 Noel, noel 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 They looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the east, beyond them far 
 And to the earth it gave great light 
 And so it continued both day and night 
 Then let us all with one accord 
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord 
 That hath made heaven and earth of naught 
 And with his blood mankind hath bought. 
 Noel, noel 
 Holy is, holy is. 
 Noel, noel 
 Holy is, holy is. 
 Noel, noel 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord 
 Holy is, holy is the Lord

The first noel the angels did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep 
 Noel, noel, noel, noel 
 Born is the king of Israel 
 They looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the east, beyond them far 
 And to the earth it gave great light 
 And so it continued both day and night 
 Noel, noel, noel, noel 
 Born is the king of Israel 
 And by the light of that same star 
 Three wise men came from country far 
 To seek for a king was their intent 
 And to follow the star wherever it went 
 This star drew nigh to the northwest 
 O'er Bethlehem it took it rest 
 And there it did both stop and stay 
 Right over the place where Jesus lay 
 Then entered in those wise men three 
 Full reverently upon their knee 
 And offered there in his presence 
 Their gold, and myrrh, and frakincense 
 Then let us all with one accord 
 Sing praises to our heavenly lord 
 That hath made heaven and earth of naught 
 And with his blood mankind hath bought 
 The first noel the angels did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep 
 Noel, noel, noel, noel 
 Born is the king of Israel

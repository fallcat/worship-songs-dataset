We're gonna dance dance dance 
 In the freedom we know 
 We're gonna dance dance 
 In the freedom we know 
 We're gonna dance dance dance 
 In the freedom we know 
 Because the freedom we know is gonna last forever 
 The world turns in all of its ways 
 But I'm soul set on a holy name 
 And when all earth is said and done 
 Still I will praise Him 
 There's no end to the love that He gives 
 And now broken dreams have life again 
 In the hope of the risen king 
 Let us praise Him 
 A Mystery unthinkable 
 But He took the fall just to save my soul 
 Now the love is the life I know 
 And on and on and on 
 We'll be singing' 
 Soul set free in the one I love 
 Come on come on 
 And let the whole earth sing in the freedom we know 
 Come on come on and praise Him 
 Come, come all the lost and the found 
 Let us rise up with a holy sound 
 All the earth unified as one 
 Just to praise Him 
 In full view with nothing to hide 
 Like a city on a hill we're gonna shine 
 In the light of the freedom 
 Let us praise Him 
 We're gonna dance dance dance 
 In the freedom we know 
 We're gonna dance dance 
 In the freedom we know 
 We're gonna dance dance dance 
 In the freedom we know 
 Because the freedom we know is gonna last forever

Give me eyes to see 
 More of who You are 
 May what I behold, 
 Still my anxious heart. 
 Take what I have known 
 And break it all apart 
 For You my God, are greater still. 
 No sky contains, 
 No doubt restrains, 
 All You are, 
 The greatness of our God. 
 I spend my life to know, 
 And I'm far from close 
 To all You are, 
 The greatness of our God. 
 Give me grace to see 
 Beyond this moment here. 
 To believe that there 
 Is nothing left to fear. 
 That You alone are high above it all. 
 For You my God, are greater still. 
 No sky contains, 
 No doubt restrains, 
 All You are, 
 The greatness of our God. 
 I spend my life to know, 
 And I'm far from close 
 To all You are, 
 The greatness of our God. 
 And there is nothing 
 That can ever separate us. 
 There is nothing that can ever 
 Separate us from Your love. 
 No life, no death, of this I am convinced. 
 You my God, are greater still. 
 And no words can say, or song convey, 
 All You are the greatness of our God. 
 I spend my life to know, 
 And I'm far from close 
 To all You are, 
 The greatness of our God.

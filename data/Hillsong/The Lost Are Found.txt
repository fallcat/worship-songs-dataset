Everlasting 
 While earthly ages fade 
 In mercy 
 Our god your kingdom reigns 
 Lord over everything 
 You are near 
 All of the universe at your feet 
 In the saviour 
 Injustice brought to right 
 For your glory 
 That your name be lifted high 
 Lord over everything 
 You are near 
 All of the universe at your feet 
 Lord over everything 
 You are near 
 All of the universe at your feet 
 The lost are found 
 The blind will see 
 The lame will walk 
 The dead will live 
 And you are god 
 Forever you will reign 
 The lost are found 
 The blind will see 
 The lame will walk 
 The dead will live 
 And you are god 
 Forever you will reign

Come join the song, lift your voice 
 As Heaven and Earth give praise 
 Fall to your knees at the feet 
 Of the Son of the One true God 
 Turn from old ways, lift your eyes 
 For the kingdom of God is here 
 Open your heart, offer all 
 For Jesus Christ is here, now 
 We have found our hope 
 We have found our peace 
 We have found our rest 
 In the One who loves 
 He will light the way 
 He will lead us home 
 As we offer all 
 To the One who saves us 
 Call on the name that is hope 
 Jesus, the Son of God 
 Lord over all, He is good 
 And His mercy endures, always 
 We have found our hope 
 We have found our peace 
 We have found our rest 
 In the One who loves 
 He will light the way 
 He will lead us home 
 As we offer all 
 To the One who saves us all 
 His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever and ever 
 His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever and ever 
 Oh, His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever and ever 
 Oh, His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever and ever 
 We have found our hope 
 We have found our peace 
 We have found our rest 
 In the One who loves 
 He will light the way 
 He will lead us home 
 As we offer all 
 To the One who saves 
 Oh, His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever and ever 
 Oh, His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever His love endures 
 Forever and ever, Jesus

The passion of our Saviour 
 The mercy of our God 
 The cross that leaves no question 
 Of the measure of His love 
 Our chains are gone 
 Our debt is paid 
 The cross has overthrown the grave 
 For Jesus' blood that sets us free 
 Means death to death 
 And life for me 
 The Innocent judged guilty 
 While the guilty one walks free 
 Death would be His portion 
 And our portion liberty 
 Our chains are gone 
 Our debt is paid 
 The cross has overthrown the grave 
 For Jesus' blood that sets us free 
 Means death to death 
 And life for me 
 I give my whole life 
 To honour this love 
 By the Lamb who was slain 
 I'm forgiven 
 The sinner's Saviour 
 Crown Him forever 
 For the Lamb who was slain 
 He is risen 
 I give my whole life 
 To honour this love 
 By the Lamb who was slain 
 I'm forgiven 
 The sinner's Saviour 
 Crown Him forever 
 For the Lamb who was slain 
 He is risen 
 Our chains are gone 
 Our debt is paid 
 The cross has overthrown the grave 
 For Jesus' blood that sets us free 
 Means death to death 
 And life for me 
 Means death to death 
 And life for me

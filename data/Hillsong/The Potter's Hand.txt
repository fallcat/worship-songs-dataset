Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior 
 I know for sure all of my days are held in Your hand 
 And crafted into Your perfect plan 
 You gently called me into Your presence 
 Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit 
 Teach me dear Lord, to live all of my life 
 Through Your eyes 
 And I'm captured by Your Holy calling 
 Set me apart, I know You're drawing me to Yourself 
 Lead me Lord, I pray 
 Take me and mold me, use me, fill me 
 I give my life to the Potter's hand 
 Call me, You guide me, lead me, walk beside me 
 I give my life to the Potter's hand 
 You gently call me into Your presence 
 Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit 
 Teach me dear Lord, to live all of my life 
 Through Your eyes 
 I'm captured by Your Holy calling 
 Set me apart, I know You're drawing me to Yourself 
 Lead me Lord, I pray 
 Take me and mold me, use me, fill me 
 I give my life to my Potter's hand 
 Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me 
 I give my life to the Potter's hand 
 Take me and mold me, use me, fill me 
 I give my life to the Potter's hand 
 Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me 
 I give my life to the Potter's hand

You stood before creation 
 Eternity within Your hand 
 You spoke the earth into motion 
 My soul now to stand 
 You stood before my failure 
 Carried the Cross for my shame 
 My sin weighed upon Your shoulders 
 My soul now to stand 
 So what can I say 
 What can I do 
 But offer this heart O God 
 Completely to You 
 So I'll walk upon salvation 
 Your Spirit alive in me 
 This life to declare Your promise 
 My soul now to stand 
 So what can I say 
 What can I do 
 But offer this heart O God 
 Completely to You 
 So I'll stand 
 With arms high and heart abandoned 
 In awe of the One who gave it all 
 So I'll stand 
 My soul Lord to You surrendered 
 All I am is Yours

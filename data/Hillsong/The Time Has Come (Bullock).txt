The time has come 
 Where justice will prevail 
 The time has come 
 His truth will never fail 
 The kingdoms of this world will fall 
 Every tower and every wall 
 And in the pow'r of righteousness 
 We stand 
 The time has come 
 The time has come 
 The time has come for justice 
 The time has come for peace 
 Time has come for righteousness 
 To shout it in the streets 
 The time has come for mercy 
 Time has come for grace 
 Time has come for every man 
 For healing and release 
 The time has come 
 Where justice will prevail 
 The time has come 
 His truth will never fail 
 The kingdoms of this world will fall 
 Every tower and every wall 
 And in the pow'r of righteousness 
 We stand 
 The time has come 
 The time has come 
 The time has come for healing 
 To reach across this land 
 Wounded spirits broken hearts 
 Shall hear and understand 
 That the time has come for mercy 
 For justice and for peace 
 The time has come and freedom cries 
 In grace we find release 
 The time has come 
 Where justice will prevail 
 The time has come 
 His truth will never fail 
 The kingdoms of this world will fall 
 Every tower and every wall 
 And in the pow'r of righteousness 
 We stand 
 The time has come 
 The time has come

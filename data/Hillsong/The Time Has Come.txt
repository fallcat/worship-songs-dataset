Found love beyond all reason 
 You gave Your life, you're all for me 
 And called me yours forever 
 Caught in the mercy fallout 
 I found hope found life 
 Found all I need 
 'Cause you're all I need 
 The time has come 
 To stand for all we believe in 
 So I for one am gonna 
 Give my praise to You 
 Today today it's all or nothing 
 All the way 
 The praise goes out to you 
 Yeah all the praise goes out to you 
 Today today I live for one thing 
 To give You praise 
 In everything I do 
 Yeah all the praise goes out to you 
 All we are is yours 
 And all we're living for 
 Is all you are 
 Is all that you are Lord

You inhabit the praises of your people 
 You delight in the glory of your son 
 In the love of the Father, we will worship 
 In the kingdom of God, we find our home 
 The wonder of your love 
 Will break the chains that bind us 
 The power of your touch 
 Releases us to worship 
 Sing out to God, sing hallelujah 
 With all we are, we will worship you 
 Holy is your name 
 Holy is your name, oh God 
 And together we'll lift the name of Jesus 
 And together we'll sing of your great love 
 We will join with the angels and praise you 
 May our voices be pleasing to you God 
 The wonder of your love 
 Will break the chains that bind us 
 The power of your touch 
 Releases us to worship 
 Sing out to God, sing hallelujah 
 With all we are, we will worship you 
 Holy is your name 
 Holy is your name, oh God 
 Sing out to God, sing hallelujah 
 With all we are, we will worship you 
 Holy is your name 
 Holy is your name, oh God

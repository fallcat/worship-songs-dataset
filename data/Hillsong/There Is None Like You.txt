There is none like You, 
 No one else can touch my heart like You do, 
 I can search for all eternity Lord 
 And find, there is none like You. 
 There is none like You. 
 No one else can touch my heart like You do, 
 I can search for all eternity Lord 
 And find, there is none like You. 
 Your mercy flows like a river wide, 
 And healing comes from Your hand. 
 Suffering children are safe in Your arms, 
 There is none like You. 
 There is none like You, (There is none like You, Lord) 
 There is none like You. 
 I can search for all eternity Lord, 
 There is none like You. 
 I can search for all eternity Lord, 
 There is none, (there is none,) 
 There is none Lord, 
 There is none like You.

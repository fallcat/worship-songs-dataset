Father true and merciful 
 Bound to me with love 
 Adopted in free from all sin 
 Jesus Saviour glorified 
 Your offering none could give 
 I stand before You humbled and in awe 
 And all 
 To You God 
 For all You are to me 
 There is nothing like 
 There is nothing like 
 Your Love... Your Love 
 Holy Spirit gift of God 
 Teach my soul to soar 
 Train me in Your Holy ways oh Lord 
 I love you forever 
 I love you forever 
 I love you forever Lord

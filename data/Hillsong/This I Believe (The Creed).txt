Our Father everlasting 
 The all creating One 
 God Almighty 
 Through Your Holy Spirit 
 Conceiving Christ the Son 
 Jesus our Savior 
 I believe in God our Father 
 I believe in Christ the Son 
 I believe in the Holy Spirit 
 Our God is three in one 
 I believe in the resurrection 
 That we will rise again 
 For I believe in the name of Jesus 
 Our Judge and our Defender 
 Suffered and crucified 
 Forgiveness is in You 
 Descended into darkness 
 You rose in glorious life 
 Forever seated high 
 I believe in God our Father 
 I believe in Christ the Son 
 I believe in the Holy Spirit 
 Our God is three in one 
 I believe in the resurrection 
 That we will rise again 
 For I believe in the name of Jesus 
 I believe in You 
 I believe You rose again 
 I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord 
 I believe in God our Father 
 I believe in Christ the Son 
 I believe in the Holy Spirit 
 Our God is three in one 
 I believe in the resurrection 
 That we will rise again 
 For I believe in the name of Jesus 
 For I believe in the name of Jesus 
 For I believe in the name of Jesus 
 I believe in life eternal 
 I believe in the virgin birth 
 I believe in the saints' communion 
 And in Your holy Church 
 I believe in the resurrection 
 When Jesus comes again 
 For I believe, in the name of Jesus 
 I believe in God our Father 
 I believe in Christ the Son 
 I believe in the Holy Spirit 
 Our God is three in one 
 I believe in the resurrection 
 That we will rise again 
 For I believe in the name of Jesus 
 For I believe in the name of Jesus

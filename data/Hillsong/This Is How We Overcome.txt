Your light broke through my night 
 Restored exceeding joy 
 Your grace fell like the rain 
 And made this desert live 
 You have turned my mourning into dancing 
 You have turned my sorrow into joy 
 Your hand lifted me up 
 I stand on higher ground 
 Your praise rose in my heart 
 And made this valley sing 
 You have turned my mourning into dancing 
 You have turned my sorrow into joy 
 You have turned my mourning into dancing 
 You have turned my sorrow into joy 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 This is how we overcome 
 You have turned my mourning into dancing 
 You have turned my sorrow into joy 
 You have turned my mourning into dancing 
 You have turned my sorrow into joy

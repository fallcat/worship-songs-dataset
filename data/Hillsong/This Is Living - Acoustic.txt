Waking up knowing there's a reason 
 All my dreams come alive 
 Life is for living with you 
 I've made my decision 
 You lift me up 
 Fill my eyes with wonder 
 Forever young in your love 
 This freedom's untainted with you 
 No moment is wasted 
 See the sun now 
 Bursting through the clouds 
 Black and white 
 Turn to colour all around 
 All is new 
 In the Savior I am found 
 This is living now 
 This is living now 
 You lead the way God 
 You're right beside me 
 In Your love I'm complete 
 There's nothing like living with you 
 This life you created I choose 
 See the sun now 
 Bursting through the clouds 
 Black and white 
 Turn to colour all around 
 All is new 
 In the Savior I am found 
 This is living now 
 This is living now 
 You take me higher 
 Than I've been before 
 It's your perfect love that sees me soar 
 God your freedom is an open door 
 You are everything 
 I want and more 
 Maybe I ain't really know what living is 
 Is it love if it was am I living it? 
 Do I live in it? So astounding 
 Love is an ocean you can drown me 
 The sweet embrace the lovely taste I taste and see I'm under Grace 
 The place to be it means I don't ever need an umbrella 
 I'm cool in the cold and the hot weather 
 Whether or never I ever understand 
 I'm a man in the hands of great plans 
 I stand with faith in a life I never known or touched 
 It's still outside my clutch but 
 I'm like what's to dream of? And what's to hope in? 
 What's to die for? And live to no end? 
 This is living 
 The life I've been given's a gift 
 If I'm gonna live it, I'm gonna live it to death 
 So what's to dream of? And what's to hope in? 
 What's to die for? And live to no end? 
 This is living 
 The life I've been given's a gift 
 If I'm gonna live it, I'm gonna live it to death 
 This is living now 
 This is living now 
 You take me higher 
 Than I've been before 
 It's your perfect love that sees me soar 
 God your freedom is an open door 
 You are everything 
 I want and more

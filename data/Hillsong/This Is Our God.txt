Your grace is enough 
 More than I need 
 And Your word I will believe 
 I wait for You 
 Draw near again 
 And Your spirit make me new 
 And I will fall at Your feet 
 I will fall at Your feet 
 And I will worship You here 
 Your presence in me 
 Jesus light the way 
 By the power of Your word 
 I am restored 
 I am redeemed 
 By Your spirit I am free 
 And I will fall at Your feet 
 I will fall at Your feet 
 And I will worship You here 
 Freely You gave it all for us 
 Surrendered Your life upon that cross 
 Great is Your love 
 Poured out for all 
 This is our God 
 Lifted on high from death to life 
 Forever our God is glorified 
 Sovereign King 
 Rescued the world 
 This is our God 
 And I will fall at Your feet 
 I will fall at Your feet 
 And I will worship You here 
 And I will fall at Your feet 
 I will fall at Your feet 
 And I will worship You here 
 Freely You gave it all for us 
 Surrendered Your life upon that cross 
 Great is Your love 
 Poured out for all 
 This is our God 
 Lifted on high from death to life 
 Forever out God is glorified 
 Sovereign King 
 Rescued the world 
 This is our God

I see all that You've given to me 
 I just got to praise 
 I sing cause Jesus is living in me 
 And I'm so amazed! 
 Your love gave me a way to freedom 
 Now I walk in the light 
 You're all 
 All that my heart is seeking 
 Cause You're great in my life 
 This is the day 
 My God has made 
 I've got a reason to celebrate 
 To jump up and down 
 And spin all around 
 To shouted hey: This is the day! 
 It doesn't matter what I face 
 It doesn't matter what comes my way 
 I know that You care for me 
 So it's all right 
 Yes, so it's all right!

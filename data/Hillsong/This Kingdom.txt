Jesus - god's righteousness revealed 
 The son of man, the son of god 
 His kingdom comes 
 Jesus - redemption's sacrifice 
 Now glorified, now justified 
 His kingdom comes 
 And this kingdom will know no end 
 And its glory shall know no bounds 
 For the majesty and power 
 Of this kingdom's king has come 
 And this kingdom's reign 
 And this kingdom's rule 
 And this kingdom's power and authority 
 Jesus - god's righteousness revealed 
 Jesus - the expression of god's love 
 The grace of god, the word of god 
 Revealed to us 
 Jesus - god's holiness displayed 
 Now glorified, now justified 
 His kingdom comes 
 Jesus... 
 God's righteousness revealed

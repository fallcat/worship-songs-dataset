You are forever in my life 
 You see me through the seasons 
 Cover me with Your hand 
 And lead me in Your righteousness 
 And I look to You 
 And I wait on You 
 I will sing to You, Lord 
 A hymn of love 
 For Your faithfulness to me 
 I'm carried in everlasting arms 
 You'll never let me go 
 Through it all 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah

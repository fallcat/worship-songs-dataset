Humble King holy One 
 Friend of sinners God's own Son 
 God in flesh among men 
 You walked my road You understand 
 Servant King friend to me 
 You saved my soul washed my feet 
 Here I'll bow give all to You 
 Lord I want to be like You 
 All I want all I need 
 More of You less of me 
 Take this life Lord it's Yours 
 Have my heart have it all 
 I will walk in Your ways 
 Love Your word seek Your face 
 My reward my sole pursuit 
 To know You more to be like You 
 Jesus Jesus all I want is to be like You 
 Jesus Jesus all I want is to be like You

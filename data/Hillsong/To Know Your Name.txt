The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems 
 Forgiven I'm alive, restored set free 
 Your Majesty resides inside of me 
 Forever I believe, forever I believe 
 Arrested by Your truth and righteousness 
 Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness 
 Convicted by Your spirit, led by Your word 
 Your love will never fail, Your love will never fail 
 'Cause I know You gave the world 
 Your only Son for us 
 To know Your name 
 To live within the Saviour's love and He took my place 
 Knowing He'd be crucified 
 And You loved, You loved 
 A people undeserving!

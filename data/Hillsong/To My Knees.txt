In the Saviour's love 
 I find joy beyond compare 
 Endless peace covers all of me 
 When You breathe within 
 You turn winter into spring 
 Grace dissolves every fear in me 
 Your Love brings me to my knees 
 Brings me to my knees 
 My King forever 
 You are all my heart desires 
 Until the end of time 
 My soul surrendered 
 In my vacant heart 
 Lord You came and made a home 
 You bring light to the dark in me 
 When I lose my way 
 I am beckoned into grace 
 You alone are my everything 
 Your Love brings me to my knees 
 Brings me to my knees 
 My King forever 
 You are all my heart desires 
 Until the end of time 
 My soul surrendered 
 All the earth sing of mercy never ending 
 I will worship with all that is within me 
 Holy Holy, Lord God almighty 
 King of Heaven, Yours is the glory 
 All the earth sing of mercy never ending 
 I will worship with all that is within me 
 Holy Holy, Lord God almighty 
 King of Heaven, Yours is the glory 
 Your Love brings me to my knees 
 Brings me to my knees 
 My King forever 
 You are all my heart desires 
 Until the end of time 
 My soul surrendered 
 Your Love brings me to my knees 
 Brings me to my knees 
 My King forever 
 You are all my heart desires 
 Until the end of time 
 My soul surrendered 
 Your Love brings me to my knees 
 Brings me to my knees 
 My King forever 
 You are all my heart desires 
 Until the end of time 
 My soul surrendered

Love unfailing 
 Overtaking my heart 
 You take me in, 
 Finding peace again. 
 Fear is lost in all you are. 
 And I would give the world 
 To tell your story. 
 'Cause I know that you've called me. 
 I know that you've called me... 
 I've lost myself for good 
 Within your promise. 
 And I won't hide it... I won't hide it 
 Jesus, I believe in you 
 And I would go, 
 To the ends of the earth 
 To the ends of the earth 
 For you, alone are the son of God... 
 And all the world will see 
 That you are God... 
 That you are God...

Every knee will bow 
 And every tongue confess 
 That Jesus Christ is Lord 
 Lord and King 
 All glory to Your name 
 All honour to Your Majesty 
 Forever, forever 
 All praise to You alone 
 Every eye will see 
 And every heart will know 
 The beauty of the Lord 
 In all the earth 
 All praise to You alone 
 All praise to You alone 
 All praise to You alone

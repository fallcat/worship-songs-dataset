Here I stand 
 Forever in Your mighty hand 
 Living with Your promise 
 Written on my heart 
 I am Yours 
 Surrendered wholly to You 
 You set me in Your family 
 Calling me Your own 
 Now I 
 I belong to You 
 Lord I need 
 Your Spirit Your word Your truth 
 Hear my cry 
 My deep desire 
 To know You more 
 In Your Name 
 I will lift my hands 
 To the King 
 This anthem of praise I bring 
 Heaven knows 
 I long to love You 
 With all I am 
 I belong to You

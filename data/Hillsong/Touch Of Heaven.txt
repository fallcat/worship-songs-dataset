How I live for the moments 
 Where I'm still in Your presence 
 All the noise dies down 
 Lord, speak to me now 
 You have all my attention 
 I will linger and listen 
 I can't miss a thing 
 Lord, I know my heart wants more of You 
 My heart wants something new 
 So I surrender all 
 All I want is to live within Your love 
 Be undone by who You are 
 My desire is to know You deeper 
 Lord, I will open up again 
 Throw my fears into the wind 
 I am desperate for a touch of heaven 
 You're the fire in the morning 
 You're the cool in the evening 
 The breath in my soul 
 Oh, the life in my bones 
 There is no hesitation 
 In Your love and affection 
 It's the sweetest of all 
 Lord, I know my heart wants more of You 
 My heart wants something new 
 So I surrender all 
 And all I want is to live within Your love 
 Be undone by who You are 
 My desire is to know You deeper 
 Lord, I will open up again 
 Throw my fears into the wind 
 I am desperate for a touch of heaven 
 I'll open up my heart to You 
 I'll open up my heart to You now 
 So do what only You can 
 Jesus, have Your way in me now 
 I'll open up my heart to You 
 I'll open up my heart to You now 
 So do what only You can 
 Jesus, have Your way in me now 
 'Cause all I want is to live within Your love 
 Be undone by who You are 
 My desire is to know You deeper 
 Lord, I will open up again 
 Throw my fears into the wind 
 I am desperate for a touch of heaven 
 'Cause all I want is to live within Your love 
 Be undone by who You are 
 My desire is to know You deeper 
 Lord, I will open up again 
 Throw my fears into the wind 
 I am desperate for a touch of heaven

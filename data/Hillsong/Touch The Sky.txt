What fortune lies beyond the stars 
 Those dazzling heights too vast to climb 
 I got so high to fall so far 
 But I found heaven as love swept low 
 My heart beating 
 My soul breathing 
 I found my life 
 When I laid it down 
 Upward falling 
 Spirit soaring 
 I touch the sky 
 When my knees hit the ground 
 What treasure waits within Your scars 
 The gift of freedom gold can't buy 
 I bought the world and sold my heart 
 You traded heaven to have me again 
 My heart beating 
 My soul breathing 
 I found my life 
 When I laid it down 
 Upward falling 
 Spirit soaring 
 I touch the sky 
 When my knees hit the ground 
 Find me here at your feet again 
 Everything I am 
 Reaching out 
 I surrender come sweep me up in 
 Your love again and my soul will dance on the 
 Wings of Forever 
 Find me here at your feet again 
 Everything I am 
 Reaching out 
 I surrender come sweep me up in 
 Your love again and my soul will dance on the 
 Wings of Forever 
 My heart beating 
 My soul breathing 
 I found my life 
 When I laid it down 
 Upward falling 
 Spirit soaring 
 I touch the sky 
 When my knees hit the ground 
 My heart beating 
 My soul breathing 
 I found my life 
 When I laid it down 
 Upward falling 
 Spirit soaring 
 I touch the sky 
 When my knees hit the ground 
 Find me here at your feet again 
 Everything I am 
 Reaching out 
 I surrender come sweep me up in 
 Your love again and my soul will dance on the 
 Wings of Forever 
 Upward falling 
 Spirit soaring 
 I touch the sky 
 When my knees hit the ground

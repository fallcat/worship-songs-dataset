We will seek Your face, Almighty God 
 Turn and pray for You to heal our land 
 Father, let revival start in us 
 Then every heart will know Your Kingdom come 
 Lifting up the name of the Lord 
 In power and in unity 
 We will see the nations turn 
 Touching Heaven, changing earth 
 Lifting up the name of the Lord 
 In power and in unity 
 We will see the nations turn 
 Touching Heaven, changing earth 
 Touching Heaven, changing earth 
 Never looking back, we'll run the race 
 Giving You our lives, we'll gain the prize 
 We will take the harvest given to us 
 Though we sow in tears, we'll reap in joy 
 Lifting up the name of the Lord 
 In power and in unity 
 We will see the nations turn 
 Touching Heaven, changing earth 
 Lifting up the name of the Lord 
 In power and in unity 
 We will see the nations turn 
 Touching Heaven, changing earth 
 Touching Heaven, changing earth

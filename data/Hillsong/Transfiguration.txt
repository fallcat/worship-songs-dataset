From the cloud You speak 
 What was veiled now is seen 
 Jesus the image of 
 The invisible God 
 Divinity confirmed 
 In the transfigured Word 
 A kingdom once concealed 
 On the earth now revealed 
 Holy is the Lord revealed before my eyes 
 And my burning heart can scarcely take it in 
 As I behold your beauty with unworthy eyes 
 The only song my soul can find to sing 
 Is Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah my King 
 Lead my longing heart 
 To the high ground, to the clear view 
 And in awe I'll be there 
 Beholding You 
 Holy is the Lord revealed before my eyes 
 And my burning heart can scarcely take it in 
 As I behold your beauty with unworthy eyes 
 The only song my soul can find to sing 
 Is Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my King 
 Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my King 
 Now I know 
 I have seen 
 The glory that cannot be unseen 
 I am changed 
 Changing still 
 As I look upon the Lord and believe 
 Holy is the Lord revealed before my eyes 
 And my burning heart can scarcely take it in 
 As I behold your beauty with unworthy eyes 
 The only song my soul can find to sing 
 Is Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my King 
 Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my King

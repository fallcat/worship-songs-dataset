When it doesn't go my way 
 I know that it is not the end 
 I'm trusting you have better plans 
 I haven't even dreamt of yet 
 I know that You are for me 
 When everything's against me 
 I put all my hope in You 
 Jesus I will trust You 
 I will trust you 
 I know you never fail 
 I will trust you 
 Jesus I will (I will) 
 Jesus I will (I will) 
 I don't know how the story ends 
 But I know that You finished it 
 I'll close my eyes and just let go 
 And fall into my only Hope 
 There's safety in the falling 
 When I surrender fully 
 I put all my hope in You 
 Jesus I will trust You 
 I will trust you 
 I know you never fail 
 I will trust you 
 Jesus I will (I will) 
 Jesus I will (I will) 
 The only thing I know 
 Is God you're in control 
 In every little detail 
 You are close 
 I'll never be alone 
 Here in the unknown 
 The power of Your Presence 
 Fills my soul 
 Now everything I know 
 Is God you're in control 
 In every little detail 
 You are close 
 I'll never be alone 
 Here in the unknown 
 The power of Your Presence 
 Fills my soul 
 Jesus I will trust You 
 I will trust you 
 I know you never fail 
 I will trust you 
 Jesus I will (I will) 
 Jesus I will (I will)

Artist: Youth Alive 
 Song: U.R.Y 
 I live for you, all that I am, all that I do... 
 My heart beats with u, and each day I wake... 
 I'll think of you... 
 *Chrous: 
 You are why I sing, you are why I live, 
 Everything of me, I'll place it at your feet 
 You are why I love... you are why I give... 
 Everything of me belongs to you... 
 I live for you... you are my God... 
 You are the truth... 
 You're all that I need, my soul in longs more of you 
 Repeat*

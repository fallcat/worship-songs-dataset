There's no silver or gold 
 And no treasure untold 
 That could draw me away from Your heart 
 Neither love of myself 
 Or of anyone else will do 
 Jesus nothing compares 
 To this grace that rescues me 
 Saviour now and forever 
 Your face is all I seek 
 Now all I am 
 I lay at Your feet 
 I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty 
 One thing I know 
 I find all I need 
 In Your unending love 
 In Your unending love 
 Letting go of my pride 
 I lay down my desires 
 Just to worship in Spirit and truth 
 More than all of my dreams 
 More than fame I will seek You Lord 
 Jesus nothing compares 
 To this grace that rescued me 
 Saviour now and forever 
 Your face is all I seek 
 Now all I am 
 I lay at Your feet 
 I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty 
 One thing I know 
 I find all I need 
 In Your unending love 
 In Your unending love 
 Now all I am 
 I lay at Your feet 
 I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty 
 One thing I know 
 I find all I need 
 In Your unending love 
 In Your unending love

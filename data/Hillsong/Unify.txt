You reached out and rescued me... 
 Answer to my dreams 
 And love hung on a cross 
 So we could meet... 
 Calmed my restlesness... words fail to express 
 There's nowhere I would rather be thatn with You... 
 The whole earth falls to it's knees 
 At the sound of Your beautiful name 
 And all the voices in the world unify today 
 To bring You this song of praise 
 I call on You my King... 
 You open your arms to me 
 And embrace me like a father to a child

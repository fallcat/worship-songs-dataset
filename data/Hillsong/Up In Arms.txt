A reckless love too wild to understand 
 Breathing the world to life in Your romance 
 So here I am 
 Your love has got me up in arms again 
 And this hope won't let me go 
 My joy is boundless 
 My soul knows its worth 
 In arms stretching wider 
 Than my heart could ever fall 
 You own the skies and still You want my heart 
 Casting Your throne aside to lift me up 
 So here I am 
 Your love has got me up in arms again 
 And this hope won't let me go 
 My joy is boundless 
 My soul knows its worth 
 In arms stretching wider 
 Than my heart could ever fall 
 Your word is final 
 Your name above all 
 The cross my reminder 
 Your love is forever 
 Cause here I am 
 Your love has got me up in arms again 
 And this hope won't let me go 
 My joy is boundless 
 My soul knows its worth 
 In arms stretching wider 
 Than my heart could ever fall 
 Your word is final 
 Your name above all 
 The cross my reminder 
 Your love is forever 
 Cause here I am 
 Your love has got me up in arms again 
 And this hope won't let me go 
 Here I am 
 Jesus take my life and all I have 
 Now this hope won't let me go

From Your sacrifice for the sake of all 
 Redemption's birth and relentless hope 
 As the weight of grace crushed the face of love 
 And You bled and died for Your enemies 
 To woo us back from death and woe 
 A valentine to a faithless world 
 Every wayward heart, You pursue us all 
 And in kindness call us home 
 This world is Yours 
 My God, this world is Yours 
 All You made to be Yours 
 I know You love us all 
 Your agape love displaces fear 
 And the plan is working, heaven's near 
 For the kingdom comes to the heart that whispers 
 Have mercy God on me 
 This world is Yours 
 My God, this world is Yours 
 All You made to be Yours 
 I know You love us all 
 All this world is Yours 
 My God, this world is Yours 
 All You made to be Yours 
 I know You love us all 
 You reign forever, You reign forevermore 
 My heart surrendered, You reign forevermore 
 You reign forever, You reign forevermore 
 My heart surrendered, You reign forevermore 
 You reign forever, You reign forevermore 
 My heart surrendered, You reign forevermore 
 This world is Yours 
 My God, this world is Yours 
 All You made to be Yours 
 I know You love us all 
 All this world is Yours 
 My God, this world is Yours 
 All You made to be Yours 
 I know You love us all

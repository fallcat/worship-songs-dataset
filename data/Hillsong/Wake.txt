At break of day, in hope we rise 
 We speak Your Name, we lift our eyes 
 Tune our hearts into Your beat 
 Where we walk, there You'll be 
 With fire in our eyes, our lives alight 
 Your love untamed, it's blazing out 
 The streets will glow forever bright 
 Your glory's breaking through the night 
 You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay 
 By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday 
 You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay 
 By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday 
 You wake within me, wake within me 
 You're in my heart forever 
 You wake within me, wake within me 
 You're in my heart forever 
 With fire in our eyes, our lives alight 
 Your love untamed, it's blazing out 
 The streets will glow forever bright 
 Your glory's breaking through the night 
 You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay 
 By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday 
 You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay 
 By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday 
 You wake within me, wake within me 
 You're in my heart forever 
 You wake within me, wake within me 
 You're in my heart forever 
 Forever, forever, forever in Your love 
 Forever, forever, forever in Your love 
 Forever, forever, forever in Your love 
 Forever, forever, we know that 
 You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay 
 By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday 
 You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay 
 By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday 
 You wake within me, wake within me 
 You're in my heart forever 
 You wake within me, wake within me 
 You're in my heart forever

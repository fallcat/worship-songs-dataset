 Album: God is in the House 
 Words and music by darlene zschech 
 Walking in the light 
 Following my Savior 
 Jesus, never let me go 
 Created in His image 
 Living in the promise 
 Of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 He'll never let me go 
 You cal me on to higher ground 
 Your mercy, love and grace abounds 
 And my soul 
 Sings Your praises 
 I'll walk in Your truth 
 I'll walk in Your light 
 Your joy and strength, it fills my life 
 And my soul 
 Sings Your praises 
 You touch my soul with holy fire 
 My life, my all, my one desire 
 To see, see Your glory 
 You hear my prayers and set me free 
 New life, new hope, my one desire 
 To see, see Your glory

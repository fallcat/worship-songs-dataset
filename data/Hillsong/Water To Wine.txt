Everlasting 
 So infinite in wildest love 
 My soul thirsts for the things above 
 Turn this water into wine 
 Blood and water 
 The mercy flowing from Your side 
 A river made of endless light 
 When my heart was running dry 
 So I'll stay 
 Stay in Your love 
 As long as life within me I'll remain 
 In who You are Lord 
 Take this wineskin 
 My spirit bursts for something new 
 There's nothing I want more than You 
 'Cause only You can satisfy 
 So I'll stay 
 I'll stay in Your love 
 As long as life within me I'll remain 
 In who You are Lord 
 So I'll stay 
 Stay in Your love 
 In the vintage of Your heart 
 Lord only You could satisfy me 
 So I'll stay 
 Fixed within Your life 
 A branch within Your vine 
 Apart from You Lord, I've got nothing 
 So I'll stay 
 I will stay within Your hold 
 I know You'll never let me go 
 And my soul it runs with mercy 
 So I'll stay 
 Stay in Your love 
 I'll stay where You are 
 As long as life remains 
 So I'll stay 
 Stay with You 
 I'll never walk away 
 I'll never be the same 
 Turn this water into wine 
 I know You love me Lord 
 I know You love me Lord 
 I know You love me Lord 
 I know You love me Lord 
 Let Your Spirit transform my soul 
 Your Spirit awakens me 
 Your Spirit sets me free 
 And for all I'm yet to know 
 I know You'll never let me go 
 I know You love me 
 I know You love me so 
 I know what love means 
 It's who You are

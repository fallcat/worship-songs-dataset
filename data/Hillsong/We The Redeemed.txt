There is nothing like Your love 
 No exchange for all You gave 
 To be welcomed into life 
 So I can know the love that saves 
 Now forever to belong 
 To walk with You for all my days 
 There's no greater love than this 
 You are the Author and the Way 
 This is the sound of the redeemed 
 Rising up to praise the King 
 Our hope is in You 
 This is the sound of the redeemed 
 Rising up to praise the King 
 Singing glorious glorious One You have saved us 
 Honor and Power and Praise to the Savior. 
 You are the Answer You are the Answer 
 You come with power come with fire 
 As we lift Your name on high 
 And join with all the saints to sing 
 In bringing Honor to the King.

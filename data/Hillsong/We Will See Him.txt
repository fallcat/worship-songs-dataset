I will lift my eyes only to God alone 
 I will set my heart trust in the Holy One 
 I will live in faith knowing His Word is sure 
 Shout loud to Earth the harvest is here and now 
 Great is our God in all the Earth 
 We will see Him 
 Coming on the clouds of Heaven exalted 
 We will see Him 
 High and lifted up he reigns in majesty in holiness 
 Almighty One 
 I will live in hope that Jesus is coming soon 
 Every nation sing glory to Christ our King 
 We'll see the glory of His Word 
 All of His promises revealed 
 See his glory shine forever 
 In light of all 
 Hallelujah lift Him higher 
 For our God reigns

You were the Word at the beginning 
 One with God, the Lord Most High 
 Your hidden glory in creation 
 Now revealed in You our Christ 
 What a beautiful name it is 
 What a beautiful name it is 
 The name of Jesus Christ my King 
 What a beautiful name it is 
 Nothing compares to this 
 What a beautiful name it is 
 The Name of Jesus 
 You didn't want heaven without us 
 So Jesus, You brought heaven down 
 My sin was great, Your love was greater 
 What could separate us now 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 The name of Jesus Christ my King 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 Nothing compares to this 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 The name of Jesus 
 What a wonderful name it is 
 The name of Jesus 
 How sweet is Your name, O God 
 How good You are 
 We love to sing of Your name, Lord 
 Love to sing of who You are 
 Death could not hold You, the veil tore before You 
 You silence the boast of sin and grave 
 The heavens are roaring the praise of Your glory 
 For You are raised to life again 
 You have no rival, You have no equal 
 Now and forever, God You reign 
 Yours is the kingdom, Yours is the glory 
 Yours is the name above all names 
 What a powerful name it is 
 What a powerful name it is 
 The name of Jesus Christ my King 
 What a powerful name it is 
 Nothing can stand against 
 What a powerful name it is 
 The name of Jesus 
 You have no rival, You have no equal 
 Now and forever, God You reign 
 Yours is the kingdom, Yours is the glory 
 Yours is the name above all names 
 What a powerful name it is 
 What a powerful name it is 
 The name of Jesus Christ my King 
 What a powerful name it is 
 Nothing can stand against 
 What a powerful name it is 
 The name of Jesus 
 What a powerful name it is 
 The name of Jesus 
 What a powerful name it is 
 The name of Jesus

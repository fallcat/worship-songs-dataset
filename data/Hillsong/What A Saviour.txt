What a Savior my Redeemer 
 Friend of sinners one like me 
 Oh what kindness suffered violence 
 Healed my blindness and set me free 
 Oh what grace I've found in You my Jesus 
 That my soul should entertain Your greatness 
 Should this life hold nothing but my Savior 
 I will praise You 
 Always 
 A heaven's glory clothed in mercy 
 Knew my story yet took my end 
 And Oh what freedom hope like heaven 
 Now forgiven I will rise again 
 Oh what grace I've found in You my Jesus 
 That my soul should entertain Your greatness 
 Should this life hold nothing but my Saviour 
 I will praise You 
 Always 
 Oh what grace I've found in You my Jesus 
 That my soul should entertain Your greatness 
 Should this life hold nothing but my Saviour 
 I will praise You 
 Always 
 I will praise You 
 Always 
 Should this life I live 
 Hold nothing but the cross where Jesus took my shame 
 Then with arms stretched wide 
 And my head held high 
 My every breath will sing again

With all I'm holding inside 
 With all hopes and desires 
 And all the dreams that I've dreamt 
 With all I'm hoping to be 
 And all that the world will bring 
 And all that fails to compare 
 You say You want all of me 
 I wouldn't have it any other way 
 I've got a Saviour and He's living in me 
 Whoa 
 I wana know 
 I wana know You today 
 And You're the best thing that has happened to me 
 And the world will never take 
 The world will never take You away 
 No one could ever take You away

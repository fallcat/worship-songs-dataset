Love 
 Laid its breath against my chest 
 My skin was thick 
 But You breathed down all my walls 
 Love 
 Like the fire steals the cold 
 The ice wore thin 
 As Your light tore through my door 
 You have my heart 
 You have my heart 
 You have my heart oh God 
 You have my heart 
 Oh hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Oh hallelujah 
 I found Your love 
 When I lost my heart to You 
 Love 
 Trading crowns to wear my shame 
 The Prince's throne for the cross that bore my thorns 
 Oh love 
 Like crashing waves of endless grace 
 You won't relent 
 Until all I am is Yours

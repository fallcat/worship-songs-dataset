When I Think about the Lord, 
 How He saved me, how He raised me, 
 How He filled me, with the Holy Ghost. 
 How He healed me, to the uttermost. 
 When I Think about the Lord, 
 How He picked me up and turned me around, 
 How He placed my feet on solid ground 
 It makes me wanna shout, 
 Hallelujah, 
 Thank you Jesus, 
 LORD, your worthy, of all the glory, and all the honor, 
 And all the praise...

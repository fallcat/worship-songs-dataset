You've overcome this world with love 
 And made my fight Your own 
 I lift my eyes and throw fear aside 
 And sing out into the night 
 Cause even when the world caves 
 Even when the fight calls 
 Even when the war's waged 
 I'll take heart 
 I know You are greater 
 Forever You are Savior 
 I will sing Your praise 
 With all that I have 
 With all that I am Lord 
 I'll stare down the waves 
 Cause You own the tide 
 I still myself and know 
 You wait for me 
 On waters wild 
 Where faith walks above the storm 
 Even when the world caves 
 Even when the fight calls 
 Even when the war's waged 
 I'll take heart 
 I know You are greater 
 Forever You are Savior 
 I will sing Your praise 
 With all that I have 
 With all that I am Lord 
 I won't let the storm weather my heart 
 Won't let the darkness beat me down 
 Sing in the night my hope alive in You 
 I'll walk through the fire and not be burned 
 Pray in the fight and watch it turn 
 Jesus tonight I give it all to You 
 I won't let the storm weather my heart 
 Won't let the darkness beat me down 
 Sing in the night my hope alive in You 
 I'll walk through the fire and not be burned 
 Pray in the fight and watch it turn 
 Jesus tonight I give it all to You 
 Even when the world caves 
 Even when the fight calls 
 Even when the war's waged 
 I'll take heart 
 I know You are greater 
 Forever You are Savior 
 I will sing Your praise 
 With all that I have 
 With all that I am Lord 
 With all that I have 
 With all that I am Lord 
 Yeah 
 Oh oh 
 Yeah 
 Oh oh 
 I won't let the storm weather my heart 
 Won't let the darkness beat me down 
 Sing in the night my hope alive in You 
 I'll walk through the fire and not be burned 
 Pray in the fight and watch it turn 
 Jesus tonight I give it all to You 
 I won't let the storm weather my heart 
 Won't let the darkness beat me down 
 Sing in the night my hope alive in You 
 I'll walk through the fire and not be burned 
 Pray in the fight and watch it turn 
 Jesus tonight I give it all to You

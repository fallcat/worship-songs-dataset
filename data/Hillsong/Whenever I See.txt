Oh when He rolls up his sleeves He ain't just puttin' on the ritz, 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 There is thunder in his footsteps and lightning in his fists 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 And the Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden 
 It wasn't for no reason that He shed his blood 
 His return is very soon and so you'd better be believin' that 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 He reigns from heaven above 
 With wisdom, pow'r and love 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 And when the sky was starless in the void of the night 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 He spoke into the darkness and created the light 
 Our God is an awesome God 
 And judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom 
 Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross 
 I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that 
 Our God is an awesome God

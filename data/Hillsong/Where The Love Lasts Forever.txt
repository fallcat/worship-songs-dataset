Your mercy found me, upon the broken road 
 And lifted me beyond my failing into Your glory 
 My sin and shame dissolved 
 And now forever Yours I'll stand 
 In love never to end to call You more than Lord 
 Glorious friend 
 So I throw my life upon all You are 
 'Cause I know You gave it all for me and when all else fades 
 My soul will dance with You 
 Where the love lasts forever 
 Your mercy found me, upon the broken road 
 And lifted me beyond my failing into Your glory 
 My sin and shame dissolved 
 And now forever Yours I'll stand 
 And forever I will sing 
 Lord, forever I will sing 
 Of how You gave Your life away just to save me 
 Lord, You saved me

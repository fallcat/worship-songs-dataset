For we know the truth 
 Your truth has set us free 
 In Your Name alone 
 We have been released 
 You are here with us 
 You are here with us 
 We are slaves no more 
 Freedom is our hope 
 Never looking back 
 Jesus You are Lord 
 We give all to You 
 We give all to You 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 Chains are broken eyes are open 
 Christ is with us 
 Christ is with us 
 Who the Son has freed 
 He is free indeed 
 All our sin is gone 
 We have been redeemed 
 Jesus paid it all 
 Jesus paid it all 
 Open wide the gates of heaven 
 Fill our hearts as we surrender 
 Lord let Your presence fall 
 Lord let Your presence fall 
 Open wide the gates of heaven 
 We will worship You forever 
 Lord let Your presence fall 
 Lord let Your presence fall

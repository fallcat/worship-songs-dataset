There is no height or depth 
 Neither life nor death 
 That can take me from all that I find 
 Here now in Your Glory Lord 
 No other powers or love 
 The things of now or to come 
 > There's nothing on earth in this life 
 That could ever separate us Lord 
 Your Love is never ending 
 To your hands we surrender 
 Where all our sins are washed away 
 Your Grace beyond reason 
 Has paid for our freedom 
 We're made alive in You 
 We run to Your Throne 
 Where we belong 
 Every heart will sing 
 That Jesus is Lord 
 Casting all else aside 
 For the joy of our Christ 
 Let Your Glory fall 
 Our hearts are filled with Your Fire 
 No other powers or love 
 The things of now or to come 
 There's nothing on earth in this life 
 That could ever separate us Lord

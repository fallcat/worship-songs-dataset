I lived 
 Heart on a wire 
 Hand in the fire for so long 
 But You've shown me better 
 A new kind of love 
 It's ever the one I want 
 I'm lifting you higher, higher 
 There's nothing that I'd rather do 
 A sweet elevation of praises 
 There's no one I love more than You 
 I never knew a love like this before 
 The kind of life that I cannot find on my own 
 I've seen the world but I have never been so sure 
 That I want Your heart 
 God, I just want to be where You are 
 Where You are 
 I just want to be where You are 
 Your love, like nothing I've seen 
 My wildest of dreams don't come close 
 Life never no better than living like this 
 I cannot resist You Lord 
 I'm lifting you higher, higher 
 There's nothing that I'd rather do 
 A sweet elevation of praises 
 There's no one I love more than You 
 I never knew a love like this before 
 The kind of life that I cannot find on my own 
 I've seen the world but I have never been so sure 
 That I want Your heart 
 God, I just want to be where You are 
 Where You are 
 I just want to be where You are 
 Where You are 
 I just want to be where You are 
 And after all this time with You by my side 
 I can't imagine what it'd be like on my own 
 I've made up my heart, this love is all I've got 
 And You're the only one I know worth living for 
 A sweet elevation of praises 
 There's no one I love more than You 
 I never knew a love like this before 
 The kind of life that I cannot find on my own 
 I've seen the world but I have never been so sure 
 That I want Your heart 
 God I just want to be where You are 
 Where You are 
 I just want to be where You are 
 Where You are 
 I just want to be where You are 
 Where You are 
 I just want to be where You are

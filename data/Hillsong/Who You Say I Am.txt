Who am I that the highest King 
 Would welcome me 
 I was lost but He brought me in 
 Oh His love for me 
 Oh His love for me 
 Who the Son sets free 
 Oh is free indeed 
 I'm a child of God 
 Yes I am 
 Free at last He has ransomed me 
 His grace runs deep 
 While I was a slave to sin 
 Jesus died for me 
 Yes He died for me 
 Who the Son sets free 
 Oh is free indeed 
 I'm a child of God 
 Yes I am 
 In my Father's house 
 There's a place for me 
 I'm a child of God 
 Yes I am 
 I am chosen, not forsaken 
 I am who You say I am 
 You are for me, not against me 
 I am who You say I am 
 I am chosen, not forsaken 
 I am who You say I am 
 You are for me, not against me 
 I am who You say I am 
 I am who You say I am 
 Who the Son sets free 
 Oh is free indeed 
 I'm a child of God 
 Yes I am 
 In my Father's house 
 There's a place for me 
 I'm a child of God 
 Yes I am 
 In my Father's house 
 There's a place for me 
 I'm a child of God 
 Yes I am

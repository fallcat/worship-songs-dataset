Into Your hand I commit again 
 With All I am For You Lord 
 You hold my world in the palm of Your hand 
 And I'm Yours forever 
 Jesus I believe in You 
 Jesus I belong to You 
 You're the reason that I live 
 The reason that I sing with all I am 
 I'll walk with You wherever You go 
 Through tears and joy I'll trust in You 
 And I will live in all of Your ways 
 Your promises forever 
 Jesus I believe in You 
 Jesus I belong to You 
 You're the reason that I live 
 The reason that I sing 
 Jesus I believe in You 
 Jesus I belong to You 
 You're the reason that I live 
 The reason that I sing with all I am 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 I will worship, I will worship You 
 Jesus I believe in You 
 Jesus I belong to You 
 You're the reason that I live 
 The reason that I sing 
 Jesus I believe in You 
 Jesus I belong to You 
 You're the reason that I live 
 The reason that I sing 
 Jesus I believe in You 
 Jesus I belong to You 
 You're the reason that I live 
 The reason that I sing with all I am

Open our hearts, 
 To see the things 
 That make Your heart cry, 
 To be the church 
 The You would desire. 
 Light to be seen. 
 Break down our pride, 
 And all the walls 
 We've built up inside, 
 Our earthly crowns 
 And all our desires, 
 We lay at Your feet. 
 So let hope rise, 
 And darkness tremble 
 In Your holy light, 
 And every eye will see 
 Jesus, our God, 
 Great and mighty to be praised. 
 God of all days, 
 Glorious in all of Your ways. 
 Your majesty, the wonder and grace, 
 In the light of Your name. 
 With everything, 
 With everything, 
 We will shout for your glory. 
 With everything, 
 With everything, 
 We will shout forth your praise. 
 Our hearts will cry 
 Be glorified, 
 Be lifted high, 
 Above all names. 
 For You our King, 
 With everything, 
 We will shout forth your praise. 
 Woah...

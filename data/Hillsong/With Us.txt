Before the world 
 You knew the plans for me 
 Before my heart believed 
 You came to my rescue 
 And now I'm found in love 
 There's nowhere else to run 
 You keep my life within 
 Your mighty hand 
 Oh God 
 There's no end to Your love 
 There's no end to Your love 
 You're with us 
 You're with us 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That could take You away 
 You're with us 
 You're with us 
 Before I call 
 I know You'll answer me 
 You'll make a way 
 Beyond what I could imagine 
 What could separate 
 From the love You give 
 I put my hope in everything 
 That You are 
 Oh God 
 There's no end to Your love 
 There's no end to Your love 
 You're with us 
 You're with us 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That could take You away 
 You're with us 
 You're with us 
 You reign in our hearts 
 You reign above all 
 Be lifted on high 
 You reign in our hearts 
 You reign above all 
 Be lifted on high 
 You reign in our hearts 
 You reign above all 
 Be lifted on high 
 You reign in our hearts 
 You reign above all 
 Be lifted on high 
 There's no end to Your love 
 There's no end to Your love 
 You're with us 
 You're with us 
 There's nothing in this world 
 That could take You away 
 You're with us 
 You're with us

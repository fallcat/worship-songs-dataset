Have you ever seen the wonder 
 In the glimmer of first sight 
 As the eyes begin to open 
 And the blindness meets the light 
 If you have so say 
 I see the world in light 
 I see the world in wonder 
 I see the world in life 
 Bursting in living colour 
 I see the world Your way 
 And I'm walking in the light 
 Have you ever seen the wonder 
 In the air of second life 
 Having come out of the waters 
 With the old one left behind 
 If you have so say 
 I see the world in light 
 I see the world in wonder 
 I see the world in life 
 Bursting in living colour 
 I see the world Your way 
 And I'm walking in the light 
 I see the world in grace 
 I see the world in gospel 
 I see the world Your way 
 And I'm walking in the light 
 I'm walking in the wonder 
 You're the wonder in the wild 
 Turning wilderness to wonder 
 If You have so say 
 I see the world in love 
 I see the world in freedom 
 I see the Jesus way 
 You're the wonder in the wild 
 I see the world Your way 
 And I'm not afraid to follow 
 I see the world Your way 
 And I'm not ashamed to say so 
 I see the Jesus way 
 And I'm walking in the light 
 I see the world in light 
 I see the world in wonder 
 I see the world in life 
 Bursting in living colour 
 I see the world Your way 
 And I'm walking in the light 
 I see the world in grace 
 I see the world in gospel 
 I see the world Your way 
 And I'm walking in the light 
 I'm walking in the wonder 
 You're the wonder in the wild 
 Turning wilderness to wonder 
 I see the world in love 
 I see the world in freedom 
 I see the Jesus way 
 You're the wonder in the wild

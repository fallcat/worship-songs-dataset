I should have been the guilty one 
 You took the blame for everything 
 I should have been in exile 
 You became the door to freedom 
 I used to live in the darkness 
 Searching for a way of escape 
 Then You turned the light on 
 Now I can see, now I can see 
 You're the answer for the world 
 The Healer of our hearts 
 Oh, what a wonder You are 
 You're my all-sufficiency 
 The Author of forgiveness 
 Oh, what a wonder, a wonder working God 
 Once I was a stranger 
 You welcomed me as a long lost friend 
 Now I have a future 
 Found in the Son, found in the Son 
 You're the answer for the world 
 The Healer of our hearts 
 Oh, what a wonder You are 
 You're my all-sufficiency 
 The Author of forgiveness 
 Oh, what a wonder 
 You're the answer for the world 
 The Healer of our hearts 
 Oh, what a wonder You are 
 You're my all-sufficiency 
 The Author of forgiveness 
 Oh, what a wonder, a wonder working God 
 Wonder working, wonder working, wonder working God 
 (There's none like You, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah) 
 Wonder working, wonder working, wonder working God 
 (Wonder working God) 
 Wonder working, wonder working, wonder working God 
 Wonder working, wonder working, wonder working God 
 Wonder working, wonder working, wonder working God

Thank you for the cross Lord 
 Thank you for the price You paid 
 Bearing all my sin and shame 
 In love You came 
 And gave amazing grace 
 Thank you for this love Lord 
 Thank you for the nail pierced hands 
 Washed me in Your cleansing flow 
 Now all I know 
 Your forgiveness and embrace 
 Worthy is the Lamb 
 Seated on the throne 
 Crown You now with many crowns 
 You reign victorious 
 High and lifted up 
 Jesus Son of God 
 The Darling of Heaven crucified 
 Worthy is the Lamb 
 Worthy is the Lamb

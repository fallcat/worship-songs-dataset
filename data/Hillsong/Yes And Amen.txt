God says Yes! And I know that I'm blessed 
 Yes! Got a heart that's at rest 
 Yes! And a future that's sealed 
 Yes! If I'm healed then I'm healed 
 I'm not afraid of circumstances 
 'Cause I, have already found the answers 
 In Christ all of God's promises are Yes! 
 Yes and Amen! 
 (repeat) 
 Stanza I: 
 Now's the time to let faith win 
 God has placed His promises in the center of His Will 
 Seek His Kingdom and His Ways 
 All the power of heaven is yours to call today 
 (repeat stanza I) 
 All God's promises 
 Yes and Amen! 
 Celebrate God's promises 
 Yes and Amen! 
 (repeat bridge 3x)

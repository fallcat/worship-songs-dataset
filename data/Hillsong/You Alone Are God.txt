I confess my hope 
 In the light of Your salvation 
 Where I lose myself 
 I will find You're all I need 
 Sing my soul 
 Of the Savior's love 
 Sing my soul 
 Unto God alone 
 I will meet You here 
 In the life we call surrender 
 Let the world I know 
 Be the glory of Your grace 
 You alone are God 
 You alone are God 
 We declare the glory of Your name 
 Reign in all the earth 
 Reign in all the earth Jesus

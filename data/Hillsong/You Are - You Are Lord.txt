You are my light and salvation, whom shall I fear? 
 You are the strength of all my days, of whom shall I be afraid? 
 Though war may rise against me, of this will I be sure 
 That I will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy Name 
 Yes, I will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy Name 
 Lord, it is You I desire, it's You that I seek 
 To live with You in Your house forever, beholding Your beauty 
 And In the time of trouble, of this will I be sure 
 You ask me who do I say that You are 
 And I say that you are the Christ, Son of the living God

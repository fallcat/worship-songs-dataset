As I come into Your presence 
 Past the gates of praise 
 Into Your sanctuary 
 Till we're standing face to face 
 I look upon Your countenance 
 I see the glory of Your Holy face 
 I can only bow down and say... 
 You are awesome in this place, Mighty God 
 You are awesome in this place, Abba Father 
 You are worthy of all praise 
 To You our hands we raise 
 You are awesome in this place, Mighty God

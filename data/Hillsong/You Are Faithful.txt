Lord of all the earth, 
 How You care for me 
 You have made me, 
 You will save 
 And carry me always 
 You are faithful, 
 You are faithful 
 You are faithful, 
 Your joy is my strength 
 Lord you are my God, 
 I rely on You 
 I put my hope 
 In things not seen 
 Your promises all true 
 Always you're with me 
 Your hand will lift me 
 My trust is in your hands

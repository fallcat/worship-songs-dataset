You are God 
 You alive 
 I will worship You forever 
 2x 
 He know me before I took my first breath 
 And He know the day that I will breath the last 
 You're the Alfa Omega beginning and end 
 Forever to You I sing 
 Into Your hands I commit my spirit 
 You're the only one who satisfies my soul 
 You're the Alfa Omega beginning and end 
 Forever to You I sing

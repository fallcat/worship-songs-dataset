Sing this 
 You are holy, holy 
 Lord there is none, like You 
 You are holy, holy 
 Glory to You my Lord 
 You are holy, holy 
 Lord there is none, like You 
 You are holy, holy 
 Glory to You my Lord 
 I sing Your praises forever 
 Deeper in love with You 
 Here in Your courts 
 Where I'm close to Your throne 
 I've found where I belong 
 I sing Your praises forever 
 Deeper in love with You 
 Here in Your courts 
 Where I'm close to Your throne 
 I've found where I belong 
 You are holy, holy 
 Lord there is none, like You 
 You are holy, holy 
 Glory to You my Lord 
 And I sing Your praises forever 
 Deeper in love with You 
 Here in Your courts 
 Where I'm close to Your throne 
 I've found where I belong

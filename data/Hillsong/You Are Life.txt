You have come 
 And we have found life 
 Everlasting 
 Now alive 
 To know Your freedom 
 Never ending 
 You alone have made a way for us 
 In Your love 
 You are life 
 I'm living in the light of my Saviour 
 Dancing in the arms of forever 
 I'm singing like I'm walking on water 
 You are life 
 Alive in me 
 From greyest skies 
 To living color 
 You have called us 
 In Your life 
 Your light uncovered 
 The world to see now 
 You alone have made a way for us 
 In Your love 
 You are life 
 I'm living in the light of my Saviour 
 Dancing in the arms of forever 
 I'm singing like I'm walking on water 
 You are life 
 Alive in me 
 I give my life to follow 
 'Cause Your love is all I want now 
 You are life 
 You are life alive in me 
 For all the world 
 To find Your love 
 For all the world 
 To see that You are God 
 Forever be lifted high (come on, you sing) 
 For One who holds the universe 
 And every beating heart 
 Across the earth 
 Jesus be lifted high 
 You are life 
 I'm living in the light of my Saviour 
 Dancing in the arms of forever 
 I'm singing like I'm walking on water 
 You are life 
 Alive in me 
 I give my life to follow 
 'Cause Your love is all I want now 
 You are life 
 You are life alive in me

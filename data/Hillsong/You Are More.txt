On the day I called 
 You answered me 
 And the hope in my soul increased 
 I lift my hands 
 And turn my eyes 
 To the God who heals my heart 
 And gives me peace 
 You are more than 
 My words could ever say 
 You are Lord over all 
 Over all of my days 
 I will see this season through 
 I will fix my eyes on You 
 Only You 
 Only You 
 I worship You 
 And lift You high 
 God forever let Your name be glorified 
 I lift my voice 
 And sing Your name 
 For you gave Your life to cleanse my sin 
 And took away my shame 
 You are more than 
 My words could ever say 
 You are Lord over all 
 Over all of my days 
 I will see this season through 
 I will fix my eyes on You 
 Only You 
 Only You 
 Hallelujah 
 The earth will sing 
 May Your name be glorified 
 Hallelujah 
 The earth will sing 
 May Your name be glorified 
 You are more than 
 My words could ever say 
 You are Lord over all 
 Over all of my days 
 I will see this season through 
 I will fix my eyes on You 
 Only You 
 Only You

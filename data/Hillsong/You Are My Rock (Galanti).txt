You are my rock on You I stand 
 Safe from the storms that surround me 
 You're my only rock in You I can 
 Don't have to rely on my own strength 
 There's a voice in the silence 
 Piercing the darkness of my own selfish soul 
 There's a cry deep within me 
 A yearning to feel You 
 I look to You Lord 
 I can't pretend I don't run from 
 The feelings I'm trying to hide 
 Must get the focus off me and my problems 
 I look to the cross

There's a voice in the silence, piercing the darkness of my own selfish soul 
 There's a cry deep within me, a yearning to fell you 
 I look to you, Lord 
 I can pretend I don't run from the feelings I'm trying to hide 
 Must get the focus of me and my problems 
 I look to the cross 
 You are my Rock 
 On You I stand 
 Safe from the storms that surround me 
 You're my only Rock, In you I can 
 Don't have to rely on my own strength.

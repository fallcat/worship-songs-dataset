I will bless the Lord forever, 
 And I will trust Him at all times. 
 He has delivered me from all things, 
 And He has set my feet upon the Rock. 
 I will not be moved, and I'll say of the Lord: 
 You are my Shield, my Strength, my Portion, Deliverer, 
 My Shelter, Strong Tower, my very present help in time of need. 
 Room have I in heaven by You. 
 There's not a desire beside You. 
 You have made me glad, and I'll say of the Lord: 
 You are my Shield, my Strength, my Portion, Deliverer, 
 My Shelter, Strong Tower, my very present help in time of need. 
 My very present help in time of need. 
 My very present help in time of need.

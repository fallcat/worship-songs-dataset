 Strength like no other 
 Strength like no other 
 Reaches to me 
 You are my hope 
 Hope like no other 
 Hope like no other

 In the power of Your Name 
 You lift me up 
 You lift me up 
 Unfailing love 
 Stronger than mountains 
 Deeper than oceans 
 Reaches to me 
 Your love O Lord 
 Reaches to the heavens 
 Your faithfulness 
 Reaches to the skies

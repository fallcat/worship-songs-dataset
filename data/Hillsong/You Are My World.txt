My father I adore You more 
 Than anything my heart could wish for 
 I just want You 
 And Jesus my beloved savior 
 Everything I am I owe to You 
 I owe it all to You 
 And angels come and adore You 
 And we Your children worship You 
 You are my world 
 You are my God 
 And I lay down my life for You 
 You are my Lord 
 The one I love 
 No one could ever take Your place 
 And everything I have I give to You 
 My Lord, the One I live for 
 I live for You 
 And all my days are gifts from You 
 I pray Id use them as You want me to 
 Use them for You 
 And angels come and adore You 
 And we your children worship You 
 You are my world 
 You are my God 
 And I lay down my life for You 
 You are my Lord 
 The One I love 
 No one could ever take Your place

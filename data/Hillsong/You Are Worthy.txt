Any crown I've ever worn 
 I lay it down 
 Any praise I've ever gained 
 I give it all to You 
 For there's nothing in this world 
 That can compare 
 For You alone are worthy 
 You alone are worthy 
 You are near to all who call 
 Upon Your name 
 Ever givin', ever loving 
 You remain the same 
 For You open up Your hand 
 And satisfy 
 I give You all the glory 
 Give You all the glory 
 You are worthy, oh Lord, of all honour 
 You are worthy to receive all praise 
 In Your presence I live and with all I have to give 
 I will worship You 
 You are near to all who call 
 Upon Your name 
 Ever giving, ever loving 
 You remain the same 
 For You open up Your hand 
 And satisfy 
 I give You all the glory 
 Give You all the glory 
 You are worthy, oh Lord, of all honour 
 You are worthy to receive all praise 
 In Your presence I live and with all I have to give 
 I will worship You 
 You are worthy, oh Lord, of all honour 
 You are worthy to receive all praise 
 In Your presence I live and with all I have to give 
 I will worship You 
 Honour You 
 Glorify Your holy name 
 I will worship You 
 Honour You 
 Glorify Your holy name 
 We will worship You, Lord 
 You are worthy, oh Lord, of all honour 
 You are worthy to receive all praise 
 In Your presence I live and with all I have to give 
 I will worship You 
 You are worthy, oh Lord, of all honour 
 You are worthy to receive all praise 
 In Your presence I live and with all I have to give 
 I will worship You 
 You are worthy, oh Lord, of all honour 
 You are worthy to receive all praise 
 In Your presence I live and with all I have to give 
 I will worship You 
 I will worship You 
 I will worship You 
 We worship You and honor You 
 We worship You, my Lord 
 You lift up my sins to You 
 We sing a new song to Your name

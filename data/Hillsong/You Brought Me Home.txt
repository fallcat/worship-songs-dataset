Your name oh Lord endures forever 
 Your fame oh Lord for all time 
 Your praises Lord will leave me never 
 Your love oh Lord is all mine 
 To Him my wisdom made the heavens 
 And His mercy ever lasting 
 To the One who gives salvation 
 I lift up my soul to You 
 Jesus, Savior, holy Lord 
 I know that You'll never forsake me or leave me alone 
 My Redeemer, Jesus Christ 
 You sacrificed yourself on the cross to bring me home 
 You brought me home

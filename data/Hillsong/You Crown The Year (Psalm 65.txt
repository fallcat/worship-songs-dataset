You crown the year with Your goodness 
 You answer us with awesome deeds 
 Your hope resounds God our Saviour 
 To distant lands and farthest seas 
 O paint the fields bright and golden 
 Drench the harvest with Your rain 
 God's river filled with living water 
 That flows to all as You ordained 
 Praise the Name of the Lord 
 O my soul sing His worth 
 All of life join the song 
 Come and lift up our King 
 Now let the earth join the dancing 
 Deck her out in showers of spring 
 The dusk and dawn forever relay 
 The call to come and worship Him 
 Holy holy 
 Worthy are You Lord 
 All the glory 
 To Your Name forever 
 You crown the year with Your goodness 
 You answer us with awesome deeds

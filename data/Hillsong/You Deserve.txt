What is this love given to us 
 That saved my life through selfless sacrifice 
 Although we fail the cross prevails 
 Forgiveness stands 
 You take me back again 
 You've shown me life 
 You've opened my eyes 
 So I give You my praise 
 Yeah I give You my all 
 You've shown me life 
 You've opened my eyes 
 To the truth that there's no greater love 
 Now in the darkness God's light shines 
 Christ forever glorified 
 So come on come on sing out to God 
 Now with all we've got 
 We live for You our God 
 Salvation's strong in Christ alone 
 The Saviour King alone in victory 
 I step aside give You my life 
 For You to move do what You want to do 
 I can't imagine a life without You without You 
 'Cause it's all for You 
 Yeah it's all for You 
 God

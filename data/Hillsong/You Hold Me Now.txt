On that day when I see 
 All that You have for me 
 When I see You face to face 
 There surrounded by Your grace 
 All my fears swept away 
 In the light of your embrace 
 When Your love is all I need 
 And forever I am free 
 Where the streets are made of gold 
 In Your presence healed and whole 
 Let these songs of heaven rise to you alone 
 No weeping, no hurt or pain 
 No suffering, You hold me now 
 You hold me now 
 No darkness, no sick or lame 
 No hiding You hold me now, 
 You hold me now 
 In this life I will stand 
 Through my joy and my pain 
 Knowing there's a greater day 
 There's a hope that never fails 
 When You're name is lifted high 
 And forever praises rise 
 For the glory of Your Name 
 I'm believing for the day 
 When the wars and violence cease 
 All creation lives in peace 
 Let these songs of heaven rise to you alone 
 No weeping, no hurt or pain 
 No suffering, You hold me now 
 You hold me now 
 No darkness, no sick or lame 
 No hiding, You hold me now, 
 You hold me now 
 For eternity 
 All my heart will give 
 All the glory to Your name 
 For eternity 
 All my heart will give 
 All the glory to Your name 
 For eternity 
 All my heart will give 
 All the glory to Your name 
 For eternity 
 All my heart will give 
 All the glory to Your name 
 No weeping, no hurt or pain 
 No suffering, You hold me now 
 You hold me now 
 No darkness, no sick or lame 
 No hiding, You hold me now, 
 You hold me now 
 No weeping, no hurt or pain 
 No suffering, You hold me now 
 You hold me now 
 No darkness, no sick or lame 
 No hiding, You hold me now, 
 You hold me now 
 No weeping, no hurt or pain 
 No suffering, You hold me now 
 You hold me now 
 No darkness, no sick or lame 
 No hiding, You hold me now, 
 You hold me now

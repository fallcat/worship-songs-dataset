When waters rise all around me 
 When mountains stand in the path I see 
 I look to love that's unfailing 
 I look to grace that is all I need 
 Oh call call upon the Name Jesus Christ 
 The only Name that saves 
 For there is no one like our God 
 There's no one like our God 
 There's nothing that can stand against You 
 There's no stronghold You can't break 
 No life that You can't save 
 Our God You never fail 
 Your light will shine through the darkness 
 Your word will calm ev'ry crashing wave 
 My hope it lies in Your promise 
 My faith it stands on the empty grave 
 Strong through ev'ry trial 
 Faithful through the night 
 Our God will never fail 
 Our God will never fail 
 Anchor through the flood 
 You keep holding on 
 I know You'll never fail 
 Jesus You'll never fail

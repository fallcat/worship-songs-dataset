What could stand before You 
 As You chose to embrace 
 A cross so undeserved You took for me 
 The weight of sin upon You 
 When You offered Your life 
 As You walked the streets of men 
 With fading strength 
 How could we live but not see 
 Your sacrifice 
 Your glory 
 You reign, You reign 
 Over everything Lord, You reign 
 With power, and justice divine 
 Over everything Lord, You reign 
 What was Your last thought 
 As You drew Your last breath 
 Where the victory was Yours for us to see 
 And all will know the truth 
 As we live by Your grace 
 Every praise to You alone 
 See now the King of Glory 
 Love of God become my calling 
 Father I surrender all I am to You forever

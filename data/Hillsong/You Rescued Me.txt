You rescued me and picked me up 
 A living hope of grace revealed 
 A life transformed in righteousness 
 O Lord You have rescued me 
 Forgiving me, You healed my heart 
 And set me free from sin and death 
 You brought me life You've made me whole 
 O Lord You have rescued me 
 And You loved me before I knew You 
 And You knew me for all time 
 I've been created in Your image O Lord 
 And You bought me, and You sought me 
 Your blood poured out for me 
 A new creation in Your image O Lord 
 You rescued me, You rescued me 
 You rescued me and picked me up 
 A living hope of grace revealed 
 A life transformed in righteousness 
 O Lord You have rescued me 
 Forgiving me, You healed my heart 
 And set me free from sin and death 
 You brought me life You've made me whole 
 O Lord You have rescued me 
 And You loved me before I knew You 
 And You knew me for all time 
 I've been created in Your image O Lord 
 And You bought me, and You sought me 
 Your blood poured out for me 
 A new creation in Your image O Lord 
 You rescued me (x6)

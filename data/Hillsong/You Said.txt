 Whatever you need" 
 You said, "Pray and I'll hear from Heaven 
 And I'll heal your land" 
 You said, Your glory will fill the earth 
 Like water, the sea 
 You said, "Lift up your eyes 
 The harvest is here, yes the Kingdom is near" 
 You said, "Ask and I'll give the nations to you" 
 Oh, Lord, that's the cry of my heart 
 Distant shores and the islands will see 
 Your light, as it rises on us 
 You said, Your glory will fill the earth 
 Like water the sea 
 You said, "Lift up your eyes 
 The harvest is here, the Kingdom is near" 
 You said, "Ask and I'll give the nations to you" 
 Oh, Lord, that's the cry of my heart 
 Distant shores and the islands will see 
 Your light, as it rises on us 
 You said, "Ask and I'll give the nations to you" 
 Oh, Lord, that's the cry of my heart 
 Distant shores and the islands will see 
 Your light, as it rises on us 
 You said, "Ask and I'll give the nations to you" 
 Oh, Lord, that's the cry of my heart 
 Distant shores and the islands will see 
 Your light, as it rises on us 
 You said that we believe 
 Oh, Lord, I ask for the nation 
 Oh, Lord, I ask for the nation 
 Even though you were there Lord 
 Oh, Lord, I ask for the nation 
 Oh, Lord, I ask for the nation

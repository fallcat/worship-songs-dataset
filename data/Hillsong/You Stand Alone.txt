I will lay me down 
 At Your feet in worship 
 And listen to the 
 Sweetest sound of all 
 Oh God You are my God 
 How my heart it longs for You 
 I'm thirsty for Your presence 
 In my world 
 I cry out night and day for more 
 To hold the majesty in You 
 My God You stand alone 
 And I worship at Your throne 
 I will look to see 
 Your power and glory 
 Jesus Lord of all 
 Jesus Lord of all

I remember the first time 
 Your love reached deep 
 Into my world 
 You read me 
 Like an open book 
 You took all the pieces 
 And made my life complete 
 In You 
 I soar on the heights 
 Of Your love 
 Dive the depths of Your grace 
 You take me higher 
 'Til I see beyond the storm 
 Surrounding me with Your love 
 I turn to find You near 
 You take me higher 
 You lift my head to open skies 
 Your fire burns within my soul 
 Abandoned to Your call 
 I take the hand of One 
 Who knows me 
 From the inside out 
 He guides me through 
 The streets of life 
 He take me through 
 Open doors 
 They open onto fields of white 
 He tells me to see 
 And perceive 
 And to hear their cry 
 You take me higher 
 'Til I see beyond the storm 
 Surrounding me with Your love 
 I turn to find You near 
 You take me higher 
 You lift my head to open skies 
 Your fire burns within my soul 
 Abandoned to Your call

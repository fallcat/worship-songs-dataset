I have decided 
 I have resolved 
 To wait upon You Lord 
 My rock and Redeemer 
 Shield and reward 
 I'll wait upon You Lord 
 As surely as the sun will rise 
 You'll come to us 
 Certain as the dawn appears 
 You'll come 
 Let Your glory fall as You respond to us 
 Spirit rain 
 Flood into our thirsty hearts again 
 You'll come 
 You'll come 
 We are not shaken 
 We are not moved 
 We wait upon You Lord 
 Mighty deliverer 
 Triumph and truth 
 We wait upon You Lord 
 As surely as the sun will rise 
 You'll come to us 
 Certain as Your word endures 
 You'll come 
 Let Your glory fall as You respond to us 
 Spirit rain 
 Flood into our thirsty hearts again 
 You'll come 
 You'll come 
 Chains be broken 
 Lives be healed 
 Eyes be opened 
 Christ is revealed

You see me when I'm sleping 
 You know when I'm awake 
 You hear me when I pray to You 
 Every word I say 
 I know You are my Father 
 The greatest One of all 
 You never ever fail me 
 My friend forever more 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need, in this world 
 You walk with me and guide me 
 My heart is in Yours hands 
 You speak your word, I hear You Lord 
 I live by Your commands 
 You change me from the inside 
 And turned the bad to good 
 You loved from my very first day 
 When I didn't know You could 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need, in this world 
 I feel You in my heart 
 In my heart 
 Oh God (Repeat)

You're all I need 
 Everything I'd ever hoped for 
 I've found in You 
 Everything I'll ever need 
 You're all I am 
 Everything I've ever hoped to be 
 I found it all in You 
 And all I see 
 Everything I've ever searched for 
 I've seen in You 
 Everything I've dreamed 
 And Your Spirit leads me on 
 In the Grace of Jesus Christ 
 This hope it fills my soul 
 All glory to Your Name 
 All power to Your Name 
 All majesty and all honor 
 All glory to Your Name 
 Your Kingdom comes to reign 
 In the glory of Your Name 
 In the power of Your Spirit 
 The glory of God 
 All glory to Your Name

You're the one 
 My whole world's wrapped around You 
 Cheer me on 
 Not looking back but moving 
 You're the one 
 I know that I am safe here in Your arms 
 Forever walking in Your love 
 Wherever You are, You know I'll follow 
 Forever nearer, I want to be with You 
 Your truth empowers me to win 
 With You beside me 
 I know that in You life begins 
 Your love completes me 
 You're the one 
 My whole world's wrapped around You 
 Cheer me on 
 Not looking back but moving 
 You're the one 
 I know that I am safe here in Your arms 
 Forever walking in Your love 
 Strength in my weakness 
 Your voice breathes life into my world 
 At the sound of Your promise 
 I rise and shout to all the earth 
 Your truth empowers me to win 
 With You beside me 
 I know that in You life begins 
 Your love completes me 
 You're the one 
 My whole world's wrapped around You 
 Cheer me on 
 Not looking back but moving 
 You're the one 
 I know that I am safe here in Your arms 
 Forever walking in Your love 
 You're the one 
 My whole world's wrapped around You 
 Cheer me on 
 Not looking back but moving 
 You're the one 
 I know that I am safe here in Your arms 
 Forever walking in Your love 
 You're The One...

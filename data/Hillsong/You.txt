Invading all my weakness 
 You wrapped me up in grace 
 The worst of me succeeded by the best of You 
 My heart is overtaken 
 My soul is overwhelmed 
 The worst of me succeeded by the best of You 
 My dreams have found their purpose 
 My future in Your hands 
 This life would have no meaning if it weren't for You 
 So I lay me down 
 For Kingdom come 
 Steel all that is within me 
 Cause all I want in this world is more of You 
 And the less of me it is You 
 Increasing as I fade away 
 Your light for all the world to see 
 God It is You who breaks the chains 
 It is You who lights the way 
 And everything I am cries out for You 
 Lord make my life transparent 
 Your life in mine displayed 
 And let every earthly glory 
 Go back to You 
 So I lay me down 
 For Kingdom come 
 Steel all that is within me 
 Cause all I want in this world Is more of You 
 And the less of me it is You 
 Increasing as I fade away 
 Your light for all the world to see 
 God It is You who breaks the chains 
 It is You who lights the way 
 And everything I am cries out for You

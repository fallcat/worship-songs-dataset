You surrounded me with songs of praise 
 You have bought me to this place 
 Where Your love and grace move within my life 
 Now Your message is my light 
 Your love is beautiful 
 Your love is beautiful 
 It's the reason why I sing 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 I am planted here by the waters 
 And I'm living for the King 
 I have found my peace in the house of God 
 This is where I'm meant to be 
 Your love is beautiful 
 Your love is beautiful 
 It's the reason why I sing 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 Your love is beautiful 
 Your love is beautiful 
 It's the reason why I sing 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin 
 All around the world 
 Let the praise begin

Your people sing praises 
 Let laughter fill the world 
 Your people sing praises 
 Let love and faith be heard 
 Jesus came to the rescue 
 And where the reason He came 
 To come on lift up a mighty voice 
 Till Jesus come again 
 We praise the Lord with our voices 
 We praise the Lord with our hearts 
 We praise the Lord with all our strength 
 And everything else that we've got 
 We praise His with dancing 
 We praise His with the drums 
 To come on lift up Jesus' Name 
 Till the day He comes

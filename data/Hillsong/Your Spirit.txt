I lay down my life at Your feet 
 Humble myself under Your mighty hand 
 For I have sinned and fallen short before 
 But I know Your grace abounds 
 Pour out Your Spirit on us 
 Pour out Your Spirit on us 
 Upon us now 
 Spirit come and fill this place 
 Sweet presence 
 Jesus Your embrace 
 Thank You Lord 
 You're worthy to be praised 
 Above all things 
 I seek Your face

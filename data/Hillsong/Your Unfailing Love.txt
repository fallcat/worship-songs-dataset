When the darkness fills my senses 
 When my blindness keeps me from Your touch 
 Jesus come 
 When my burden keeps me doubting 
 When my memories take the place of You 
 Jesus come 
 And I'll follow You there 
 To the place where we meet 
 And I'll lay down my pride 
 As You search me again 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 Your unfailing love over me again 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 Your unfailing love over me again 
 When the darkness fills my senses 
 When my blindness keeps me from Your touch 
 Jesus come 
 When my burden keeps me doubting 
 When my memories take the place of You 
 Jesus, Jesus come 
 And I'll follow You there 
 To the place where we meet 
 And I'll lay down my pride 
 As You search me again 
 And I'll follow You there 
 To the place where we meet 
 And I'll lay down my my pride 
 As You search me again 
 And I'll follow You there 
 To the place where we meet 
 And I'll lay down my pride 
 As You search me again 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 Your unfailing love over me again 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 Your unfailing love over me again 
 Unfailing love 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 Your unfailing love over me again 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 Your unfailing love over me again

Before the earth knew its foundations 
 You spoke the dust into creation 
 Until the end when all has withered 
 Then still Your word will endure forever 
 The lamp unto my feet 
 The light unto my path 
 Oh 
 Your word will not be shaken 
 Your word will never fail me 
 Like a fire in my bones 
 Like a whisper to my soul 
 Your word is revelation 
 Deep calls to deep within Your presence 
 When I hear You speak, my soul awakens 
 Your Spirit leads, my heart to worship 
 As Your word reveals the light of Jesus 
 The lamp unto my feet 
 The light unto my path 
 Oh 
 Your word will not be shaken 
 Your word will never fail me 
 Like a fire in my bones 
 Like a whisper to my soul 
 Your word is revelation 
 Oh 
 Your word will not be shaken 
 Your word will never fail me 
 Like a fire in my bones 
 Like a whisper to my soul 
 Your word is revelation 
 Your word will not be shaken 
 Your word will never fail me 
 Like a fire in my bones 
 Like a whisper to my soul 
 Your word is revelation 
 Your word will never fail me 
 Like a fire in my bones 
 Like a whisper to my soul 
 Your word is revelation

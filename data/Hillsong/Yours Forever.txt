Say His name within the darkest hour 
 And see His light illuminate our path 
 The road is narrow but our gaze is set 
 On the love of Christ till the very end 
 Walk in the truth that overcame our sin 
 We're leaving our past and how we once had lived 
 Giving our lives to see Your name made known 
 'Cause the love of Christ is what the world needs most 
 So Lord lead us in the ways of Your love 
 To lead our broken world to Your cross 
 Lead us in the ways of Your love 
 We are Yours forever 
 Our lives won't be the same 
 Yours forever 
 Our eyes won't turn away 
 Yours forever 
 Singing Your praises until our lungs give out 
 To the hope of the world, the One who gave us life 
 Giving our lives to see Your name made known 
 'Cause the love of Christ is what the world needs most 
 So Lord lead us in the ways of Your love 
 To lead our broken world to Your cross 
 Lead us in the ways of Your love 
 We are Yours forever 
 Our lives won't be the same 
 Yours forever 
 Our eyes won't turn away 
 Yours forever 
 Our lives won't be the same 
 Yours forever 
 Our eyes won't turn away 
 We're living in the One who gave 
 His life to see our sin erased 
 We know, we know 
 Our hope is never gonna fade away 
 We're living in the One who gave 
 His life to see our sin erased 
 We know, we know 
 Our hope is never gonna fade away 
 Lord lead us in the ways of Your love 
 To lead our broken world to Your cross 
 Lead us in the ways of Your love 
 We are Yours forever 
 Our lives won't be the same 
 Yours forever 
 Our eyes won't turn away 
 Yours forever 
 Our lives won't be the same 
 Yours forever 
 Our eyes won't turn away

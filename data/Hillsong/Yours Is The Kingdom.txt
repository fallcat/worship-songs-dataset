Yours is the Kingdom 
 And the power 
 And the glory forever is Yours 
 Heaven and earth bow down 
 In the wonder of Your Name 
 Heaven is open 
 Death is broken 
 And the glory forever is Yours 
 Nothing can overcome 
 The power of Your Name 
 King above kings 
 All the universe will sing 
 Everlasting God 
 You are wonderful 
 You are wonderful 
 And the shout of the earth 
 Will be Your praise 
 God forever 
 And the light unto all 
 Will be Your wonderful Name 
 For the glory Lord is Yours 
 God forever 
 All the glory Lord is Yours

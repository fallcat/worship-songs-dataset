Many words cannot express 
 The beauty of Your holiness 
 How Your image came to rest in me 
 And many waters cannot quench 
 The fire burning deep within 
 Let Your love begin to rise in me 
 We sing oh, oh let it rise 
 Show me the heights and the depths 
 Show me the length and the width 
 Fling wide the doors of my chest 
 Fill me with the fullness 
 Show me the heights and the depths 
 Show me the length and the width 
 Fling wide the doors of my chest 
 Fill me with the fullness 
 Fill me with the fullness

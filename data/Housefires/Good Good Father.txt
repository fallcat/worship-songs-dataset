I've heard a thousand stories 
 Of what they think You're like 
 But I've heard the tender whisper 
 Of love in the dead of night 
 And You tell me that You're pleased 
 And that I'm never alone 
 You're a good, good Father 
 It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are 
 And I'm loved by You 
 It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am 
 I've seen many searching 
 For answers far and wide 
 But I know we're all searching 
 For answers only You provide 
 Because You know just what we need 
 Before we even say a word 
 You are perfect in all of Your ways 
 You are perfect in all of Your ways 
 You are perfect in all of Your ways to us 
 Love so undeniable 
 I can hardly speak 
 Peace so unexplainable 
 I can hardly think 
 As You call me deeper still 
 As You call me deeper still 
 As You call me deeper still 
 Into love, love, love...

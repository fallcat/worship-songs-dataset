There is beauty in my brokenness 
 I've got true love instead of pain 
 There is freedom though you've captured me 
 I've got joy instead of mourning 
 You give me joy down deep in my soul 
 Down deep in my soul 
 Down deep in my soul 
 In your presence there is freedom 
 In your presence there is fullness 
 In your presence there is joy 
 There is joy forevermore 
 Never been so free 
 Caught in your love for me 
 Never been more secure 
 Knowing your heart, Lord

Rivers of unfailing love 
 Sweep my fears away 
 The kindness of the Savior's touch 
 Heals the heart that breaks 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 Won't You take me higher and higher 
 And You show me love again 
 You alone my sole desire 
 The wonders of Your heart for us 
 Awakes the dead in me 
 His praises rise, it floods a fire 
 And stirs my soul to sing 
 That You're the lifter of my head 
 Won't You take me higher and higher 
 And You show me love again 
 You alone my sole desire 
 (You're the lifter) 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 Won't You take me higher and higher 
 And You show me love again 
 You alone my sole desire 
 The King of kings, the Lord of lords 
 Highly exalted 
 The Son of God, the face of love 
 Oh You're highly exalted 
 The King of kings, the Lord of lords 
 Highly exalted 
 The Son of God, the face of love 
 Highly exalted 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 Won't You take me higher and higher 
 And You show me love again 
 You alone my sole desire 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 Won't You take me higher and higher 
 And You show me love again 
 You alone my sole desire 
 You alone 
 You alone 
 You lift my eyes 
 Oh, You lift my eyes 
 So I fix my eyes on what I cannot see 
 Mercy and grace all around 
 Oh, You lift my head 
 Oh, You lift my head 
 All I could see was everything wrong 
 And all I could see is that I wasn't good enough 
 All I could see is my selfish pride 
 Oh, You lift my eyes 
 Oh, You lift my eyes 
 'Cause You're the lifter of my head 
 Won't You take me higher and higher 
 (Teach me to see the night and You) 
 You show me love again 
 (You alone, You alone) 
 You alone my sole desire 
 (Oh, You lift my head tonight) 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 (I set the Lord always before me) 
 Won't You take me higher and higher 
 He is at my right hand, I would not be shaken 
 And You show me love again 
 (Lift my head, lift my head) 
 You alone my sole desire 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 And You take me higher and higher 
 And You show me love again 
 You alone my sole desire 
 Oh, You show me love 
 And I was blind, You show me love 
 The scales fall off my eyes tonight 
 Jesus, King of kings 
 The King of kings, the Lord of lords 
 Highly exalted 
 The Son of God, You're the face of love 
 Highly exalted 
 (The King of kings) 
 The King of kings, the Lord of lords 
 Highly exalted 
 The Son of God, the face of love 
 Highly exalted

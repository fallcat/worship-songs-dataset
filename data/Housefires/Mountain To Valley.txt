Plagued by Your promises 
 Words You have spoken 
 Desire You've placed in me 
 Faithfully You will complete 
 From mountain to the valley 
 From the dessert to the raging sea 
 And in the silence or the city streets 
 Oh, Your presence always covers me 
 Hope, You will lead the way 
 Peace, You will be my strength 
 To see in the midst of storms 
 And believe in Your goodness, Lord 
 From mountain to the valley 
 From the dessert to the raging sea 
 In the silence or the city streets 
 Oh, Your presence always covers me 
 From mountain to the valley 
 From the dessert to the raging sea 
 And in the silence or the city streets 
 Oh, Your presence always covers me 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 Such a journey walking with You now 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 Such a journey walking with You now 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 You take me in, You lead me out 
 Such a journey walking with You now 
 When I don't know what steps to take 
 When I don't know what moves to make 
 This one thing I can't escape 
 Your love 
 When I don't have the words to say 
 When I can't seem to find my way 
 This one thing I can't escape 
 It's Your love, it's Your love 
 From mountain to the valley 
 From the dessert to the raging sea 
 In the silence or the city streets 
 Oh, Your presence always covers me 
 From mountain to the valley 
 From the dessert to the raging sea 
 In the silence or the city streets 
 Oh, Your presence always covers me 
 Oh, Your presence always covers me 
 Oh, Your presence always covers me 
 When I don't know what steps to take 
 When I don't know what moves to make 
 This one thing I can't escape 
 Your love 
 When I don't have the words to say 
 When I can't seem to find my way 
 This one thing I can't escape 
 Your love 
 Oh, it's Your love 
 It's Your love 
 It's Your love

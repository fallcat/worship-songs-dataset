Even in the wilderness 
 Through confusion and barrenness 
 You are beautiful God 
 Even in my brokenness 
 Through this pain I will confess 
 You are always good 
 Deserts will bloom in the light of Your love 
 Valleys make room for the river of God 
 You never run dry 
 Never run dry 
 Never run dry 
 You're my source, never ending 
 You're my life, never lacking

Where can I run from Your presence? 
 Where can I flee from You? 
 Even if I hide on the highest mountain 
 You are there 
 Where can I run from Your presence? 
 Where can I flee from You? 
 Even if I lie in the lowest valley 
 You will find me there 
 Deeper than any ocean 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Higher than any mountain 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 And if I clothe myself in shadow 
 Would I fade away from You? 
 No, even if I fall to the deepest darkness 
 Love surrounds me still 
 No, even if I fall to the deepest darkness 
 Your love surrounds me still 
 Deeper than any ocean 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Higher than any mountain 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Deeper than any ocean 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Higher than any mountain 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 There is no ending to Your 
 Love that holds on and won't let go 
 Love that won't leave me on my own 
 I'm falling deeper into Your 
 Love that holds on and won't let go 
 Love that won't leave me on my own 
 There is no ending to Your 
 Love that holds on and won't let go 
 Love that won't leave me on my own 
 I'm falling deeper into Your 
 Love that holds on and won't let go 
 Love that won't leave me on my own 
 Deeper than any ocean 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Higher than any mountain 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Deeper than any ocean 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Higher than any mountain 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Your love goes on and on 
 Your love goes on and on and on and on 
 Your love goes on 
 Your love goes on and on 
 Your love goes on

 There's nowhere I could run 
 There's nowhere I could hide 
 There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord 
 There's nowhere I could run 
 There's nowhere I could hide 
 There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord 
 There's nowhere I could run 
 There's nowhere I could hide 
 There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord 
 There's nowhere I could run 
 There's nowhere I could hide 
 There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord

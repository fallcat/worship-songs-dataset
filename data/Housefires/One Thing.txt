This one thing I ask 
 This one thing I seek 
 To dwell within your house 
 Everyday of my life 
 This one thing I ask 
 This only do I seek 
 To gaze upon your beauty 
 In this holy place 
 You are the one thing 
 You are the one thing that I need 
 You are the one thing 
 You are the one thing that I need 
 You give me eyes to see, eyes to see you 
 You give me ears to hear, ears to hear you 
 You give me a heart to know, a heart to know you 
 I wanna know you more, I wanna know you more

Pull me in closer, close to Your heart 
 May I be a pure reflection of all You are 
 Love that is patient, love that is kind 
 And love that keeps no offenses or wrongs in my mind 
 Make me like Jesus 
 Make me like Jesus 
 My heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I'm open, I'm open 
 My heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I'm open, I'm open 
 You're faithful to find me, right where I am 
 Though even in my wandering, You call me friend 
 And mercy receives me and lifts me to my feet 
 And I'm caught up in the wonder and mystery 
 I'll know when Jesus 
 I'll know when Jesus 
 My heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I'm open, I'm open 
 My heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I'm open, I'm open 
 Do whatever You wanna do 
 And say whatever You wanna say 
 And move however You wanna move 
 And change whatever You wanna change 
 Do whatever You wanna do 
 And say whatever You wanna say 
 And move however You wanna move, God 
 And change whatever You wanna change 
 My heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I'm open, I'm open 
 My heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I am open, I am oh (open) 
 What are You saying? Where are You going? 
 My heart is open wide and my eyes are open wide 
 What are You saying? Where are You going? 
 My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide, come on 
 What are You saying? Where are You going? 
 My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide 
 What are You saying? Where are You going? 
 My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide 
 What are You saying? Where are You going? 
 My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide 
 What are You saying? Where are You going? 
 My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide 
 And my heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I'm open, I'm open 
 My heart is an open space 
 For You to come and have Your way 
 I'm open, I'm open

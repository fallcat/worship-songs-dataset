Your love will never fail, You're steadfast 
 Your promises are true, You're faithful 
 You cover all my sin with forgiveness 
 My eyes have seen Your ways, Your goodness 
 Love and faithfulness meet, we behold Your glory 
 When righteousness and peace kiss, heaven's all around us 
 Spring up, O Well, Living Water rise within us 
 Spring up, O Well, Holy Spirit deep within us 
 Rise, Rise 
 Rise, Rise 
 Your love will never fail, You're steadfast 
 Your promises are true, You're faithful 
 You cover all my sin with forgiveness 
 My eyes have seen Your ways, Your goodness 
 Love and faithfulness meet, we behold Your glory 
 When righteousness and peace kiss, heaven's all around us 
 Spring up, O Well, Living Water rise within us 
 Spring up, O Well, Holy Spirit deep within us

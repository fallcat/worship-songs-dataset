This love is an everyday kind of love 
 Every morning I'm in it 
 This love is an everyday kind of love 
 Every evening I'm in it 
 This love will ruin every fear 
 This love lifts me up above the waves 
 I don't need to be overwhelmed 
 It raises me upon a rock 
 So my feet can finally stand on ground

You knock on the door of my heart 
 And I will answer You 
 I will answer You 
 You make me a covenant of love 
 And I will walk with You 
 Yes, I will walk with You

 You and You alone can have it all 
 You lead me by waters that are calm 
 And I will follow You 
 I will follow You 
 You're dancing and singing over us 
 And I will dance with You 
 I will dance with You 
 I'm not afraid 
 I'm not afraid anymore

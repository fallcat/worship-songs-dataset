Oh my peace 
 Jesus my peace 
 Oh You are my peace 
 I'm letting go of fear tonight 
 Letting go of worry, letting go of pain 
 Oh, every hindrance upon me 
 Letting go of all my fear, all my worries 
 Letting go of pain, every hindrance upon me 
 I'll let it go, I let it go, I let it go 
 We cast our anxiety on You, Jesus 
 'Cause You care for us Lord 
 Yes I let it go, I let it go, oh 
 'Cause You are my peace 
 I let it go, oh I let it go, oh just let it go 
 'Cause You are my peace 
 I let it go, I let it go, oh I let it go 
 Oh, You are my peace 
 Yeah I let it go, yes I let it go, I let it go 
 Oh, You are my peace 
 So I trust You, yes I trust You, Jesus I trust You 
 Oh, You are my peace 
 Yes I trust You, I trust You, oh I trust You 
 Oh, You are my peace 
 All you weary, come and lay your burdens down 
 His yoke is easy, there is rest to be found 
 All you weary, come and lay your burdens down 
 His yoke is easy, there is rest to be found 
 All you weary, come and lay your burdens down 
 His yoke is easy, there is rest to be found 
 All you weary, come and lay your burdens down 
 His yoke is easy, there is rest to be found 
 So I trust You, I trust You, Father I trust You 
 Oh, You are my peace

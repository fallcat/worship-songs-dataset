O that men would praise Him 
 O that men would praise Him 
 Let the nations praise Him 
 Let the nations praise Him 
 O that men would praise His name 
 Praise His name to the ends of the earth 
 And again I say... 
 Rejoice in the Lord always 
 And again I say, and again I say 
 Rejoice in the Lord always 
 And again I say, and again I say 
 Rejoice 
 Rejoice...

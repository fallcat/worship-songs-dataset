Rejoice in the Lord always 
 And again I say, and again I say 
 Rejoice in the Lord always 
 And again I say, and again I say 
 Rejoice 
 Come bless the Lord, come bless the Lord 
 Draw near to worship Christ the Lord 
 And bless His name, His Holy name 
 Declaring He is good 
 O that men would praise Him 
 O that men would praise Him 
 O that men would praise His name 
 Praise His name to the ends of the earth 
 And again I say... 
 Rejoice 
 Rejoice...

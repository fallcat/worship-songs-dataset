All around, all around 
 Everywhere I look Your love is all around 
 All around, all around 
 Everywhere I look Your love is all around 
 Let the nations sing, let the people shout 
 Let Your kingdom come, pour Your Spirit out 
 Manifest, manifest Your love 
 Manifest, manifest Your love 
 Your love is too deep to navigate 
 And it's too high to climb 
 But still it's available 
 Time after time, after time, after time, after time 
 Your love lifted me 
 It's too deep to navigate 
 It's too high to climb 
 But still it's available 
 Time after time, after time, after time, after time 
 Everywhere I look Your love is all around 
 Everywhere I look Your love is all around

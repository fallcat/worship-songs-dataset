What I wanna say now is a message for the people 
 Who have storms in your life, we gotta work it out 
 Let me say it once now then again for those who need it 
 In these troubled times, let's try to work it out 
 Anybody ask you tell 'em you don't need a reason 
 To believe me now, we're gonna work it out 
 And if you want me then I'll tell them 
 Like you told me a hundred thousand times we can work it out 
 Maybe you know how it feels 
 Maybe sometimes it all comes down to what is real 
 It ain't always what it seems 
 Still it's better to believe than to have seen 
 Let me get you say now with as much as you can feel it 
 In your own design, we can work it out 
 Don't you be afraid, child, ain't no reason to conceal it 
 This is your good time, let's try to work it out 
 If the spirit moves ya, let it lose ya in the groove of what you know is right 
 Do you know what I mean? 
 Is it something you just can't receive? 
 And it's not what it seems 
 Still it's better to believe than to have seen 
 Do you know what I mean? 
 When I say it comes down to what is real 
 Maybe it's not what it seems, oh yeah 
 Still it's better, still it's better 
 Still it's better, better to believe 
 Still it's better, still it's better 
 Still it's better, better to believe 
 Still it's better, still it's better 
 Still it's better, better to believe 
 Still it's better, still it's better 
 Still it's better, better to believe 
 Still it's better, still it's better 
 Still it's better, better to believe

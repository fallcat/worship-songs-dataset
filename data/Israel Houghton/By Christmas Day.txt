Another year has passed 
 Life just moves too fast 
 Where will I find time to live my dream 
 There's so much left of me to be 
 Expedite and bring to life those things I need 
 Hear my prayer 
 My request 
 This is my earnest plea 
 Hearts desire what I believe to see 
 God let it be if You don't mind 
 Could it be mine by Christmas day 
 Hear what I say 
 Not a timeline 
 Just let it be mine 
 Christmas day 
 My time to save the world 
 Or help one boy or girl 
 By simply taking out the time to hear 
 What could it hurt to help to dry a tear 
 Or letting one lonely heart know I care 
 Let it be mine 
 Let it be mine 
 Let it be mine 
 Let it be mine Christmas day

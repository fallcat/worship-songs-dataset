(Feat. Jonathan Butler) 
 Come and let us sing 
 Come and let us sing 
 Come and let us sing 
 To the King of kings 
 Enter his gates with thanksgiving 
 Enter his courts with praise 
 He's worthy to be praised 
 Exalt his holy name 
 Glory and honor 
 Majesty and power 
 Come and let us shout 
 Come and let us shout 
 Come and let us shout 
 To the Lord our God 
 Come and let us dance 
 Come and let us dance 
 Come and let us dance 
 Lift up holy hands 
 Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

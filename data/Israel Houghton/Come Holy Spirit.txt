 Come with Grace and fire 
 Mighty Rushing wind 
 Comforter and Breath of heaven 
 Fill my heart again 
 Come holy Spirit O How we need you

 Come with Heavens power 
 Let the rains descend 
 Times of sweet refreshing

 Fill my heart, Heal my heart

 Every hour I need thee 
 Bless me now my savior

 I praise you, I praise you 
 Praise the name of Jesus 
 He's my rock, He's my fortress 
 He's my deliverer in him will I trust 
 Praise the name of Jesus 
 I worship you, I worship you 
 I worship you, I worship you 
 I give you praise 
 For you are my righteousness 
 I worship you almighty God 
 There is none like you [x4]

Come in from the outside 
 Don't be ashamed 
 Come in from the outside 
 And bless His name 
 It's all on the inside 
 Where His glory reigns 
 Enter in 
 Come in from the outside 
 Just as you are 
 Come in from the outside 
 You're not too far 
 It's all on the inside 
 Simply open your heart 
 Enter in 
 Everybody everybody 
 Everybody everybody 
 Everybody everybody 
 Let everything that hath breath 
 Praise the Lord 
 Everybody everybody 
 Praise 
 We're the generation 
 That will give You praise and adoration 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Let Your will be done 
 Establish now Your throne, oh my Lord 
 O my Lord 
 Lord, Lord, Lord 
 Praise You Lord 
 Lord, Lord, Lord 
 We love You Lord 
 Lord, Lord, Lord 
 O my Lord

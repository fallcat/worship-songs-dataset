Lord I reach for You lead me to Your heart 
 And I thirst for You draw me deeper still 
 Deeper into the water 
 Deeper until I under 
 Living water flow 
 And over take us 
 Ooh, flow 
 Healing water flow 
 And over take us 
 Close enough to feel the cadence of Your heart 
 For justice Lord 
 Streams of justice flow to the least of these 
 Take us Lord 
 Deeper into the water 
 Deeper until I under 
 Living water flow 
 And over take us 
 Ooh, flow 
 Healing water flow 
 And over take us 
 God give us a heart 
 Give us a heart 
 Give us Your heart 
 God give us a heart 
 Deep cries out to deep 
 God give us a heart 
 Give us a heart 
 Give us Your heart 
 God give us a heart 
 For the least of these 
 For the least of these 
 For the least of these

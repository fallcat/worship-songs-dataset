I heard 'em say He brought me from a mighty long way 
 And now today I can testify that I believe it 
 And on my way I realized He's the one who kept me 
 When the storms of life arise, sleepless nights and desperate cries 
 He has captured every tear assuring me He hears 
 Every prayer, waiting on the answer only to discover He is near 
 And He hears every prayer for He has done great things 
 And I believe He's a God that always answers prayer 
 I heard 'em say the prayers of the righteous availeth much 
 And now today I can testify that I believe it 
 Now on my way I wanna let you know that He will keep you 
 When the storms of life arise, sleepless nights and desperate cries 
 He's captured every tear assuring me that He hears 
 Every prayer, waiting on the answer only to discover He is near 
 And He hears every prayer for He has done great things 
 I believe He's a God that always answers prayer 
 Don't despise the tears you've cried 
 Or the prayers that you have prayed 
 Heaven heard your every word 
 And the answer, the answer's on the way 
 I heard 'em say there is an answer on the way 
 My God has done so many great things, great things 
 Hold on and you will see there is an answer on the way 
 My God has done so many great things, great things 
 Oh, there is an answer on the way 
 My God has done so many great things, great things 
 Hold on, hold on, there is an answer on the way 
 My God has done so many great things, great things 
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on 
 You can make it, you can make it 
 You can make it for he has done great things 
 I believe He's a God that always 
 I believe He's a God that always 
 I believe He's a God who always answers prayers 
 Yes, He does

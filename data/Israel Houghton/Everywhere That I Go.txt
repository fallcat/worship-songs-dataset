Go 
 I belong to You, You belong to me Lord 
 I'm surrounded everywhere that I go 
 I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord 
 I'm surrounded everywhere that I go 
 Oh, would you sing it with me? 
 I belong to You, You belong to me Lord 
 I'm surrounded everywhere that I go 
 I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord 
 I'm surrounded everywhere that I go 
 And I am Yours and You are mine, oh mine 
 You promised me You'd never leave 
 You promised me I'm never forsaken 
 I believe goodness and mercy will follow me 
 Surrounding me where I go, everywhere that I go 
 I belong to You, You belong to me Lord 
 I'm surrounded everywhere that I go 
 I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord 
 I'm surrounded everywhere that I go 
 And I am Yours and You are mine, oh mine 
 You promised me You'd never leave 
 You promised me I'm never forsaken 
 I believe goodness and mercy will follow me 
 Surrounding me where I go, everywhere that I go 
 You Lord are a shield above me 
 Everywhere, everywhere that I go 
 You Lord are a shield above me 
 Everywhere, everywhere that I go 
 You Lord are a shield above me 
 Everywhere, everywhere that I go 
 Your grace and love surrounds me 
 Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere that I go 
 I believe goodness and mercy will follow me 
 Surrounding me where I go 
 You promised me You'd never leave me 
 You promised me I'm never forsaken 
 I believe goodness and mercy will follow me 
 Surrounding me where I go, where I go 
 Where I go, everywhere that I go

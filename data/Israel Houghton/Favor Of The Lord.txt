Verse One: 
 It's my season for the favor of the Lord 
 Soul is thirsty for an outpour 
 I am standing on the promises of God 
 Everything he has for me I receive 
 I am blessed to be a blessing 
 I have a promise a promise from Heaven 
 It's my season it's my time for the favor of the Lord 
 Vamp: 
 Pressed down shaken it together 
 Running over in the favor of God 
 Pressed down shaken together 
 Running over running over

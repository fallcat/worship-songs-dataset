There will never be a friend as dear to me 
 There will never be a friend as dear to me 
 There will never be a friend as dear to me as You 
 I worship You in spirit and in truth 
 I worship You in Spirit and in truth 
 There will never be a friend as dear to me 
 There will never be a friend as dear to me 
 There will never be a friend as dear to me as... 
 There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus 
 No, no, no, no, no not one 
 No, no, not one 
 There's not an hour that He is, He is not near us 
 No, no, not one 
 O no, no not one 
 Jesus knows 
 He knows all about our trouble 
 And He will guide till the day 
 The day is done 
 There's not a friend 
 There's not a friend 
 There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus 
 No not one 
 No not one 
 No not one 
 No not one 
 No not one 
 O what peace we often forfeit 
 O what needless pain we bear 
 All because we do not carry 
 All we gotta do is carry 
 Everything to God in prayer 
 What a friend we have in Jesus 
 All our sins and griefs to bear 
 What a privilege to carry 
 Everything to God in prayer 
 Everything to God in prayer 
 Everything to God in prayer 
 Everytime You call me I receive Your healing 
 Everytime You call me friend 
 I receive Your healing

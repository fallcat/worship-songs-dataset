You are drawing me into Your presence 
 To the beauty of Your Holiness 
 You are calling me to come and worship 
 And my answer to Your call is 'Yes' 
 I'm coming closer, closer to the flame 
 And I can hear Your voice as clear 
 As the first day, You say 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back, return 
 And let the fires burn again 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back, return 
 And let the fires burn again 
 I'm reminded of the days of passion 
 When my worship flowed so unrestrained, remember 
 Like the prodigal I've learned my lesson, yeah 
 And I never want to be the same 
 I'm coming closer, closer to the flame 
 And I can hear Your voice as clear 
 As the first day, You say 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back, return 
 And let the fires burn again 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back, return 
 And let the fires burn again 
 Go back, return 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back, return 
 And let the fires burn again 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back to your first love 
 Go back, return 
 And let the fires burn again 
 Go back, go back, go back 
 Go back, go back, go back 
 Turn around, return 
 And let the fires burn again 
 Go, how did you get here 
 Turn around you're gonna sound all over again 
 Go back return 
 And let the fires burn again, again, again 
 People are trippin' man 
 People need Jesus, Tommy 
 Let's get, let's bring Jesus to 'em

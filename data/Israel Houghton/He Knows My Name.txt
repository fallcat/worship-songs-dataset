Israel: 
 I have a Maker 
 He Formed My Heart 
 Before even time began 
 My life was in hands 
 He knows my name 
 He knows my every thought 
 He sees each tear that falls 
 And hears me when I call 
 Kids: 
 I have a father 
 He calls me his own 
 He'll never leave me 
 No matter where I go 
 He knows my name 
 He knows my every thought 
 He sees each tear that falls 
 And hears me when I call 
 He hears me when I call... 
 He hears me when I call... 
 He hears me when I call...(you are my father and I love you) 
 He hears me when I call...(you are my father and I love you) 
 He hears me when I call...(you are my father and I love you) 
 He hears me when I call...(you are my father and I love you) 
 He knows my name 
 He knows my every thought 
 He sees each tear that falls 
 And hears me when I call

Light of the world 
 You stepped down into darkness 
 Opened my eyes let me see 
 Beauty that made this heart adore You 
 Hope of a life spent with You 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 King of all days 
 O so highly exalted 
 Glorious in Heaven above 
 Humbly You came to the earth You created 
 All for love's sake became poor 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon the cross 
 ...Worship You 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 I worship You for who You are 
 I worship You 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 I worship You for who You are

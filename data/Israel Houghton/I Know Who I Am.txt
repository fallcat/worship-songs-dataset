I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I am yours, I am yours 
 And you are mine 
 Jesus you are mine 
 You are mine 
 Jesus you are mine 
 I was running and you found me 
 I was blinded and you gave me sight 
 You put a song of praise in me 
 I was broken and you healed me 
 I was dying and you gave me life 
 Lord you are my identity 
 And I know, I know 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I am yours, I am yours 
 I was running and you found me 
 I was blinded and you gave me sight 
 You put a song of praise in me 
 I was broken and you healed me 
 I was dying and you gave me life 
 Lord you are my identity 
 And I know, I know, I know, I know 
 I am forgiven 
 I am your friend 
 I am accepted, I know who I am 
 (I know who I am) 
 I am secured, I'm confident, 
 That I am loved, I know who I am 
 (I know who I am) 
 I am alive 
 I've been set free 
 I belong to you and you belong to me 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh 
 Hey 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I am yours, I am yours 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I know who I am 
 I am yours, I am yours 
 And you are mine 
 Jesus you are mine 
 You are mine 
 Jesus you are mine

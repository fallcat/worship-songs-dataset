Father, I love you 
 My heart is filled with desire to see 
 Your power and glory 
 Cover the earth as the waters clothe the sea 
 I am surrounded by the fortress of God 
 Totally surrendered to you 
 Padre te amo en mi corazon, hay deseos de ver 
 Tu feurza tu gloria, que cubre la tierra 
 Como ola del mar, soy rodeada 
 De la gracia de dios, totalmente entregada a ti 
 I lift up my hands standing unashamed 
 I worship You father, exalting your name 
 You've captured my heart, now my life is changed 
 I lift up my hands, I lift up my hands 
 I lift up my hands standing unashamed 
 I worship You father, exalting your name 
 You've captured my heart, now my life is changed 
 I lift up my hands, I lift up my hands 
 I lift up my hands 
 I lift up my hands 
 I lift up my hands

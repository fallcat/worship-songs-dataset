How precious how lovely 
 Are your thoughts oh Lord toward me 
 How truly amazing 
 Is the grace that You have shown 
 Oh Majesty I live to see Your face 
 I will search for You 
 And I will find You 
 I will find You with all my heart 
 I will lift my hands to You in worship 
 And I will worship with all my heart 
 How gracious relentless 
 Is the Father's love toward us 
 Breathtaking the beauty 
 And the radiance of You 
 Oh Majesty I live to see 
 Your face and be transformed 
 Into Your image 
 I will search for You 
 And I will find You 
 I will find You with all my heart 
 I will lift my hands to You in worship 
 And I will worship with all my heart 
 I will search for You 
 And I will find You 
 I will find You with all my heart 
 I will lift my hands to You in worship 
 And I will worship with all my heart 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I will worship You with all my heart 
 Oh Majesty I live to see 
 Your face and be transformed 
 Into Your image 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I will worship You with all my heart 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I will worship You with all my heart 
 I will search for You 
 And I will find You 
 I will find You with all my heart 
 I will lift my hands to You in worship 
 And I will worship with all my heart

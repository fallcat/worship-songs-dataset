Where would I be 
 If not for Your grace? 
 Carrying me 
 Through every season 
 Where would I be 
 If not for Your grace? 
 Came to rescue me 
 And I want to thank You 
 For Your grace 
 Grace that restores 
 Grace that redeems 
 Grace that releases 
 Me to worship 
 Grace that repairs 
 Visions and dreams 
 Grace that releases 
 Miracles

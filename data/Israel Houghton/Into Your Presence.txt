I came here to lose my - self 
 To give all I am a - way 
 I'm offering all I have to g- I've 
 And I will take nothing 
 I will take nothing 
 But You 
 So take me into You presence 
 Into Your glory 
 I am surren - dered to You 
 There You can change me and rear - range me 
 I need You 
 Into Your presence 
 Into Your glory 
 I am surren - dered to You 
 There You can change me and rear - range me ... 
 1. I need You 
 2. I need You 
 'Cause I need You 
 'Cause I need You 
 'Cause I need You 
 'Cause I need You

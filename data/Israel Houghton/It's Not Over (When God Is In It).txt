It's not over, it's not finished 
 It's not ending, it's only the beginning 
 When god is in it, all things are new 
 All things are new 
 I know it's darkest just before dawn 
 Might be the hardest season you experience 
 I know it hurts, won't be too long 
 You're closer than you think you are 
 You're closer than you've been before 
 Look to the sky, help is on the way 
 It's not over, it's not finished 
 It's not ending, it's only the beginning 
 When god is in it all things are new 
 All things are new 
 Something is moving, turning around 
 Seasons are changing, everything is different now 
 Here comes the sun, piercing the clouds 
 You're closer than you think you are 
 You're closer than you've been before 
 Look to the sky, help is on the way 
 Our god is faithful (faithful to say) 
 It's not over, it's not finished 
 It's not ending, it's only the beginning 
 It's not over, it's not finished 
 It's not ending, it's only the beginning 
 When god is in it 
 When god is in it 
 When god is in it, there is no limit 
 When god is in it, it's not over 
 It's not over 
 When god is in it, there is no limit 
 When god is in it, it's not over 
 When god is in it, there is no limit 
 When god is in it, it's not over 
 It's not over, till god says so 
 So I count it all joy 
 You make all things new 
 It's not over, till god says so 
 So I count it all joy 
 It's not over, it's not over 
 It's not over, till god says so 
 So I count it all joy 
 You make all things new 
 It's not over, till god says so 
 So I count it all joy 
 It's not over, it's not over, it's not over, it's not over 
 It's not over

Jesus at the center of it all 
 Jesus at the center of it all 
 From beginning to the end 
 It will always be, it's always been You, Jesus 
 Jesus, nothing else matters 
 Nothing in this world will do 
 Jesus, You're the center 
 Everything revolves around You 
 Jesus, You 
 Jesus, be the center of my life 
 Jesus, be the center of my life 
 From beginning to the end 
 It will always be, it's always been You, Jesus 
 Jesus, nothing else matters 
 Nothing in this world will do 
 Jesus, You're the center 
 Everything revolves around You, Jesus, You 
 From my heart to the Heavens, Jesus be the center 
 It's all about You, yes, it's all about You 
 From my heart to the Heavens, Jesus be the center 
 It's all about You, yes, it's all about You 
 So Jesus, be the center of Your church 
 Jesus be the center of Your church 
 And every knee will bow 
 And every tongue shall confess You Jesus, Jesus 
 Say His name, Jesus, Jesus 
 From my heart to the Heavens, Jesus be the center 
 It's all about You, yes, it's all about You

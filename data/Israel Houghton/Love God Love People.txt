Hi Guys, 
 Welcome to Abbey Road 
 Please come in. 
 Oh wow. Thank you so much. 
 How can I thank You for the way that You freely gave 
 Love so beautiful 
 Unconditionally 
 I had to stop, take a break, feeling good today 
 Everything's wonderful 
 You didn't have to do this for me 
 But then I look and see 
 All of the suffering 
 Wanna do something 
 But something's got to start with me 
 I can't give it 
 Till I live it 
 Now that my eyes are opened 
 Teach me how to love 
 Love God 
 Love People 
 Love my neighbor as myself 
 My brother 
 My sister 
 Everybody love somebody 
 Oh... oh... oh... 
 Love somebody 
 And now it's time to make a change 
 Revolution Day 
 Put it into action 
 And live compassionately 
 You take the black and the white 
 Red, Yellow, Brown 
 Life gets better 
 It just gets better when we 
 We look around and see 
 All of the humanity 
 Waiting on someone 
 That someone is you and me 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 Now that your heart is opened 
 Just reach out and love 
 Love God (Love God) 
 Love People (Love People) 
 Love my neighbor as myself 
 My brother 
 My sister 
 Everybody love somebody 
 Love God (Love God) 
 Love People (Love People) 
 Love my neighbor as myself 
 My brother 
 My sister 
 Everybody love somebody 
 Oh... oh... oh... 
 Love somebody 
 L... O... V... E... 
 L... O... V... E... 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 You can't live it 
 Till you give it away 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 Now that your heart is wide open 
 You've gotta give all of your love 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 You can't live it 
 Till you give it away 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 Now that your heart is wide open 
 You've gotta give all of your love 
 You can't live without giving love 
 So let your heart be open 
 Just reach out and 
 Just reach out and love 
 Love God (Love God) 
 Love People (Love People) 
 Love my neighbor as myself 
 My brother

 Everybody love somebody 
 Love God (Love God)

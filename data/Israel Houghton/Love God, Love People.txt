How can I thank You for the way that you freely gave 
 Love so beautiful unconditionally 
 Had to stop take a break feelin' good today 
 Everything's wonderful You didn't have to do this for me 
 But then I look and see all of the suffering 
 I wanna do something 
 But something's gotta start with me 
 I can't give till I live it 
 Now that my eyes are open 
 Teach me how to love 
 Love God love people 
 Love my neighbor as myself 
 My brother, my sister 
 Everybody love somebody 
 Love somebody 
 And now it's time to make a change 
 Revolution day 
 Put it into action live compassionately 
 You take the black and the white 
 Red yellow brown 
 Life gets better 
 We look around and see all of humanity 
 Waiting on someone 
 Someone is you and me 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 Now that your heart is open 
 Just reach out and love 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 You can't live it 
 Until you give it away 
 You can't give it 
 Till you live it 
 Now that your heart is wide open 
 You gotta give all of your love 
 You can't live without giving love 
 So let your heart be open 
 Just reach out and 
 Just reach out and love 
 How can I thank You for the way that you freely gave 
 Love so beautiful unconditionally 
 Had to stop take a break feelin' good today

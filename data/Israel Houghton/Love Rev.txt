People dream of simple things 
 Like worry free water 
 While some of us 
 Complaint and fuss 
 About things like internet connections 
 A mother pleads her baby screams 
 This HIV's relentless 
 But my new web page is all the rage 
 LOL OMG like we should totally be friends 
 What if we could see what they see 
 Hear what they hear 
 Feel what they feel 
 God is with us 
 When we are with them 
 When we are with them 
 God is with us 
 God is for us if we are for them 
 If we are for them 
 God is for us 
 So be an answer a solution 
 Join the love revolution 
 C'mon c'mon c'mon 
 The sun beats down on cracking ground 
 No food around for miles 
 But I'm so upset I'm a little stressed 
 'Cause my pizza delivery is running late 
 And they said it was gonna be here within 30 minutes or less 
 I'm just sayin' it better be free I'm just sayin' 
 A troubled night no end in sight 
 Mosquito bites are deadly 
 But I have a cold stuffy nose 
 And my medicine just hasn't kicked in yet 
 What if I and the ME 
 Turned into THEY and the WE 
 Together we could be 
 The change that we all want to see 
 All right it's a love it's a love 
 It's a love revolution

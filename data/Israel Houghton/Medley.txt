You put a song in my heart rhythm in my step 
 Praise as my garment for the spirit of heaviness 
 Beauty for ashes joy for my pain 
 Love overwhelming causes me to say 
 You've made me glad 
 You've made me glad 
 You've made me glad 
 Lord I will rejoice because You have 
 You've made me glad 
 You've made me glad 
 You've made me glad 
 Lord I will rejoice because You have made me glad 
 So I will lift my hands and lift my voice 
 The way I feel I have no choice 
 You made me glad 
 I'm gonna dannce and sing and shout for joy 
 And praise Your name I will rejoice 
 You made me glad 
 Lord we declare 
 Who can compare 
 Who would even dare 
 Cause there is no one like You

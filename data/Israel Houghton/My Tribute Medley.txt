How can say thanks for the things 
 You have done for me 
 Things so undeserved yet you gave. 
 To prove your love for me 
 The voices of a million angels 
 Could not express my gratitude 
 All that am and ever hope to be 
 I owe it all to thee 
 To god be the glory, to god be the glory 
 To god be the glory for the things he has done 
 He has done 
 With his blood he has saved me 
 With his power he has raised me 
 To God be the glory for the things he has done 
 Just let me live my life and 
 Let it be pleasing LORD to thee 
 And if I gain any praise let it go to Calvary 
 With his blood he has saved me 
 With his power he has raised me 
 To God be the glory for the things he has done 
 How great is our God 
 Sing with me 
 How great is our God 
 And all will see 
 Hoe great is our God

It's a new season, it's a new day 
 A fresh anointing is flowing my way 
 It's a season of power and prosperity 
 It's a new season coming to me 
 The devil's time is up, no longer can he bother me 
 'Cause the Creator of the universe, He fathers me 
 And it's transferable, my children's children shall be free 
 It's a new season 
 (It's a new season) 
 If you don't know by now, you need to know it's jubilee 
 Where debts are cancel and your children walk in victory 
 It's so available to you right now, just taste and see 
 It's a new season 
 (It's a new season) 
 The new millennium presents a new horizon 
 And no greater time for us to make a choice and take a stand 
 All that we need is resting in His hands 
 It's a new season 
 (It's a new season) 
 All that was stolen is returned to you a hundred fold 
 Tried in the fire but you're coming out gold 
 Cling to His hand, yes, to every promise take a hold 
 It's a new season 
 (It's a new season) 
 It's a new season coming to me

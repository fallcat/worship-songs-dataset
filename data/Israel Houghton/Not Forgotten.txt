I am not forgotten 
 I am not forgotten 
 I am not forgotten 
 God knows my name 
 He knows my name 
 Light over darkness 
 Strength over weakness 
 Joy over sadness 
 He knows my name 
 Father to the fatherless 
 Friend to the friendless 
 Hope for the hopeless 
 He knows my name 
 I will praise You, I will praise You 
 For I am fearfully and wonderfully made 
 I am not forgotten, never forsaken 
 I am not forgotten 
 I am not forgotten 
 I am not forgotten 
 God knows my name 
 He knows my name 
 Do you realize that you're alive 
 At the greatest time in history? 
 We are the chosen generation 
 We are the chosen generation 
 We're gonna change the world 
 We're gonna change the world

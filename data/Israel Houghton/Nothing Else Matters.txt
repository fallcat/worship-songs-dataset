So many pressures in life 
 So many reasons to throw in the towel 
 When I feel like I'm losing this fight 
 Consolation from Heaven comes clearly to me 
 To remind me, to remind me 
 Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus 
 Seeking the Master, the one who reigns over my life 
 Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus 
 Just to sit at Your feet, hear Your voice clearly speak 
 Lifts me out of defeat, for in You I'm complete 
 Reminds me nothing else, nothing else matters 
 You've got so many rivers to cross 
 So many mountains discouraging you 
 Just don't focus on yesterday's loss, no 
 Consolation from Heaven comes clearly to you 
 To remind you, to remind you 
 Nothing else than seeing You, Jesus 
 Seeking the Master, you're the one who reigns over my life 
 Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus 
 Just to sit at Your feet, hear Your voice clearly speak 
 Lifts me out of defeat, for in You I'm complete 
 Just remind me that nothing else, nothing else matters 
 Lord, I'm broken, before I need to receive 
 A fresh touch from Heaven and you'll not leave 
 'Til You touch me, oh Lord I pray 
 I need You every day with all of my heart I believe, I believe 
 That You're all I'll ever need, oh yes you are 
 You're all I'll ever need, you're all I'll ever need, yeah 
 Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus 
 Seeking the Master, seeking you right now 
 You're the one who reigns over my life 
 Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus 
 Just to sit at Your feet, hear Your voice clearly speak 
 Lifts me out of defeat, for in You I'm complete 
 Just to sit at Your feet, hear Your voice clearly speak 
 Lifts me out of defeat, for in You I'm complete 
 Just to sit, hear Your voice clearly speak 
 Oh yeah, say it again, say it again, say it again 
 Just remind me that nothing else, nothing else matters

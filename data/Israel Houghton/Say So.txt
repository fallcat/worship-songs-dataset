What does it mean to be saved? 
 Isn't it more than just a prayer to pray? 
 More than just a way to heaven. 
 What does it mean to be His? 
 To be formed in His likeness, 
 Know that we have a purpose. 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world, in the world 
 To be salt and light in the world 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Say so, say so. 
 Oh, that the church would arise 
 Oh that we would see with Jesus eyes. 
 We could show the world heaven 
 Show what it means to be His 
 To be formed in His likeness 
 Show them they have a purpose 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world, in the world 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world. 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world, in the world. 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world. 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Say so, say so. 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed. 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed, 
 I am redeemed. 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world, in the world. 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world. 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world, in the world 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world. 
 To be salt and light 
 In the world, in the world, in the world 
 In the world, in the world. 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord rise up 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord rise up 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord rise up 
 Rise up, Rise up. 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Say so, say so.

 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Say so, say so, say so.

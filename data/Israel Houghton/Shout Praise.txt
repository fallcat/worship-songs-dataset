Praise Him sun and moon, praise Him shining stars 
 All created things made at His command 
 Governments and kings, nations of the earth 
 Gather young and old to worship 
 Let everything that has breath 
 Shout praise to His name 
 To the name above all names 
 Sing glory, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah to His name 
 King Jesus, Jesus be praised 
 Underneath our feet there's a shaking 
 As the church awakes to it's calling 
 Hope is rising strong, freedom's coming 
 Heaven and earth unite in worship 
 Let everything that has breath 
 Shout praise to His name 
 To the name above all names 
 Sing glory, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah to His name 
 King Jesus, Jesus be praised 
 What you want, what you know 
 We've got to make His kingdom grow 
 What you want, what you know 
 We've got to make His kingdom grow 
 The King is coming, King is coming 
 Let everything that has breath praise Him 
 The King is coming, King is coming 
 Let everything that has breath praise Him 
 The King is coming, King is coming 
 Let everything that has breath praise Him 
 The King is coming, King is coming 
 Let everything that has breath 
 Shout praise to His name 
 To the name above all names 
 Sing glory, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah to His name 
 Shout praise 
 Sing glory 
 Hallelujah to His name 
 King Jesus, Jesus 
 King Jesus, Jesus be praised

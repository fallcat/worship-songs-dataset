I was lost, I was desperate and broken 
 Wounded heart and the wounds were still open 
 That's the way You found me 
 That's the way You found me 
 Turn the page by Your hand 
 Yesterday washed away as You write in the sand 
 My accusers, where are they? 
 One by one in the silence they all walk away 
 And I will worship You for all that You are 
 And all You've done for me 
 As long as I live I'll sing 
 I'll sing redemption's song 
 Weeping comes in the night 
 But there's joy, blessed joy in the morning sky 
 Now that I, I belong 
 To the One who has given the words to the song 
 And I will freely sing of all that You are 
 And all You've done for me 
 As long as I live I'll sing 
 I'll sing redemption's song 
 Sing redemption's song 
 All that You are and all You've done for me 
 As long as I live I will sing 
 I will sing redemption's song 
 I was lost, I was desperate and broken 
 That's the way You found me 
 That's the way You found me 
 That's the way You found me 
 That's why I love You 
 That's why I love You 
 That's why I love You 
 That's why I love You 
 That's why I love You 
 That's why I love You, why I love You

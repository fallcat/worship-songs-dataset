You have taken the precious from the worthless 
 And given us beauty for ashes, love for hate 
 You have chosen the weak things of the world 
 To shame that which is strong 
 And the foolish things to shame the wise 
 You are help to the helpless 
 Strength to the stranger 
 And a father to the child that's left alone 
 You invited the thirsty to come to the water 
 And those who have no money come and buy 
 So come 
 Come, so come 
 Behold the days are coming 
 For the Lord has promised 
 When the plow man will overtake the reaper 
 And our hearts will be the threshing floor 
 And the move of God we cried out for will come 
 Surely come, Oh God 
 And you will shake the heavens and fill your house with glory 
 Turn the shame of the outcast into praise 
 Now all creation groans and waits for the Spirit and Bride 
 To say the words that your heart has longed to hear 
 So come 
 Come, so come

Verse One: 
 You gave me courage to believe that all your goodness I will see and if it had not been for you standing on my side where would I be 
 If not for your goodness if not for your grace I don't know where I would be today if not for your kindness I never could say I'm still standing if not for your mercy if not for your love I most likely would have given up if not for your favor I never could say I'm still standing but by the grace of God 
 Verse Two: 
 To you I lift my offering and set my heart on higher things for if it had not been for you standing on my side where would I be 
 Vamp: 
 I'm still standing I'm standing I'm still standing but by the grace of God

 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
 Follow me all my days 
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
 Yeah, follow me all of the days of my life 
 Used to believe that I could never ever please Ya 
 Spent a long time running scared 
 Couldn't receive that You would never ever leave me 
 Didn't know that You would call me friend 
 But now Your grace for me is ever chasing me 
 No possibility of ever letting go 
 And You're not mad at me, no You're not mad at me 
 You're madly in love with me 
 You love me madly, madly, madly 
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
 Follow me all my days 
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
 Yeah, follow me all of the days of my life 
 With all of my might I sing Your praises so freely 
 I lift my hands and I lift them high 
 Open my heart to say that You are so lovely 
 I worship You as a lifestyle 
 And now Your grace for me is overtaking me 
 No possibility of ever letting go 
 So You're not mad at me, no You're not mad at me 
 You're madly in love with me 
 You love me madly, madly, madly 
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
 Follow me all my days 
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
 Follow me all of the days of my life 
 Fi me life, fi me la life, what me say? 
 Watch yah now, see it yah, now, now 
 Watch yah now, see it yah, now, now 
 Goodness and mercy it ago follow, follow, follow, follow me 
 All the days of my, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 All the days of fi we life, me sing so 
 So be confident of this one thing 
 That He who has began a good work in you shall complete 
 When you go through the waters go through the fire, He will be there 
 Oh no, no rivers shall not overflow you, He will be there

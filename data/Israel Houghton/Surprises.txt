From first to last 
 You knew my days 
 Future and past 
 You saw everything 
 When I would fail 
 When I would win 
 When I would need 
 Grace to start again 
 Nothing surprises You 
 Nothing surprises You about me Jesus 
 Nothing that I could do 
 Nothing could separate You from me 
 Oh, You see me 
 You know me! 
 You love me madly 
 Cover my life 
 Order my steps 
 I'll follow Christ? 
 My answer's yes 
 Sometimes I'll rise 
 And sometimes I'll fall 
 So glad your love is unconditional 
 Nothing surprises You 
 Nothing surprises You about me Jesus 
 Nothing that I could do 
 Nothing could separate You from me 
 Oh, You see me 
 You know me! 
 You love me madly 
 And You're not mad at me 
 You're not mad at me 
 You're more than enough 
 Oh you're madly in love with me 
 And You're not mad at me 
 You're not mad at me 
 You're more than enough 
 Oh you're madly in love with me 
 No, You're not mad at me 
 No, You're my Daddy 
 You're more than enough 
 Oh You're madly in love with me 
 You're not mad at me 
 You're not mad at me 
 You're not mad at me 
 More than enough 
 More than enough 
 You see me 
 You know me 
 You love me madly 
 You're more than enough (more than enough) 
 You're more than enough (more than enough) 
 Crazy about me 
 Madly, You're madly in love with me

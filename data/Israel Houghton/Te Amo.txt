Te Amo, I love You 
 Con todo mi corazon (2x) 
 With all my heart, Oh Senor 
 With all my soul, Oh Senor 
 I Love You Lord 
 Te Amo, Te Amo 
 I love You Lord, I love You Lord (2x) 
 I love the way, You never change 
 Your Word remains for ever and ever 
 I love Your Name, Jesus the same 
 Yesterday today, for ever and ever 
 Oh Lord your love never fails me 
 Oh Lord you love never fails 
 I love Your Grace, that broke the chains 
 Of sin and shame, for ever and ever 
 I love Your Mercy, Lord You are Worthy 
 Of all the Glory, for ever and ever 
 Ooh oh oh Your Love never fails me 
 No Your Love never fails me. 
 (T-Bone) 
 Your love is out outta this world 
 Its extraterrestrial 
 Like a thief como ladron 
 You stole my heart corazon 
 Your love is so magnetic 
 It keeps pulling me closer in 
 Y tu son mi todo padre 
 You are my everything 
 Al fin encontre lo que buscaba 
 Cuando tenia nada 
 Mi alma estava tan vacia but now 
 I finally found what I was missing 
 Every christian that's listening 
 Can reminisce to what I'm talking about 
 It's a love that I can't contain 
 Something that you just can't explain 
 Can't hold back and I can't refrain 
 'Cause God your love it's like pouring rain 
 Oh oh oh your love never fails 
 Camino derechito no camino de lado 
 Camino derechito con mi cristo a mi lado vamo 
 Oh oh oh your love never fails 
 Camino derechito con mi cristo a mi lado vamo 
 Oh oh oh your love never fails

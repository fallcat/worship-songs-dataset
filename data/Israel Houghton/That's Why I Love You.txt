Hallelujah, what a mighty God 
 You made a way for me 
 You made a way for me 
 No one like You 
 Wonderful You are 
 You freely gave to me 
 You freely gave me a 
 Hope and a future 
 Now I live to worship You 
 That's why I love You 
 Because You first loved me 
 Yeah, You first loved me 
 Thank You Jesus 
 My whole life has changed 
 You laid it down for me 
 You laid it down for me 
 Out of darkness 
 Called me by my name 
 You shined Your light on me 
 You shined Your light of 
 Hope and a future 
 Now I live to worship You 
 You gave me a hope 
 You gave me a future 
 I love You 
 'Cause You first loved me

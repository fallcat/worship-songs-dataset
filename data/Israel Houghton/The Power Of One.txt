What if it all depended on me 
 To change the world, to change the world? 
 What if my only responsibility was 
 To change the world, change the world? 
 Let me be the one to start a revolution 
 Let me sing my song to the people of the world 
 It all begins with one, the power of one 
 Joining the hundreds of millions of people believing 
 In one, the power of one 
 Don't hang around, stand up or sit down and believe 
 We can change the world together 
 We can change the world together 
 What kind of love can conquer disease? 
 And change the world, change the world? 
 What I can do to make poverty history 
 And change the world, change the world? 
 Let me be the one to start a revolution 
 Let me sing my song to the people of the world 
 To the children of the world 
 It all begins with one, the power of one 
 Joining the hundreds of millions of people believing 
 In one, the power of one 
 Don't hang around, stand up or sit down and believe 
 We can change the world together 
 We can change the world together 
 Please don't close your eyes, please don't turn away 
 Let your voices rise, put love on display 
 And make a difference now 
 I believe you and me can make a difference now 
 It all begins with one, the power of one 
 Joining the hundreds of millions of people believing 
 In one, the power of one 
 Don't hang around, stand up or sit down and believe 
 We can change the world together 
 We can change the world together 
 We can change the world together 
 It all begins with one 
 It all begins with one 
 You and me can make it, you and me can make it 
 You and me can make it better together 
 You and me can make it, you and me can make it 
 You and me can make it better together with one

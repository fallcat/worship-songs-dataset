There's a liftin' of the hands 
 There's a liftin' of the hearts 
 There's a lifting of the eyes beyond the hills where our help comes from 
 We will lift up our hands 
 We will lift up our hearts 
 We will lift up our eyes beyond the hills where our help comes from 
 Our help comes from you, we lift up our hands 
 Our help comes from you, we lift up our hearts 
 Our help comes from you, we lift up our eyes where our help comes from 
 There's a liftin', we lift up our hands 
 There's a liftin', we lift up our hearts 
 There's a liftin', we lift up our eyes where our help comes from 
 We realize where I help comes from

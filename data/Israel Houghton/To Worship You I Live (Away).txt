Away, away from the noise 
 Alone with You 
 Away, away to hear your voice 
 And meet with You 
 Nothing else matters, my one desire is 
 To worship You, I live 
 To worship You, I live, I live 
 To worship You 
 To worship You, I live 
 To worship You, I live, I live 
 To worship You 
 Away, away, away, away from the noise 
 Alone with You 
 'Way, away to hear your voice 
 And meet with You, meet with You 
 It's been a while but hear my heart cry again 
 To worship You, I live 
 To worship You, I live, I live 
 To worship You 
 To worship You, I live 
 To worship You, I live, I live 
 To worship You 
 To worship You, I live 
 To worship You, I live, I live 
 To worship You 
 Nothing else matters 
 Nothing else matters 
 To worship You, I live 
 To worship You, I live, I live 
 To worship You

I'm trading my sorrows 
 And I'm trading my shame 
 And I'm laying it down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 And I'm trading my sickness 
 And I'm trading my pain 
 I'm laying it, laying it, laying it down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 I'm laying it down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 I'm trading my sickness 
 I'm trading my pain 
 I'm laying it down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Amen 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Amen 
 I'm pressed but not crushed 
 Persecuted, not abandoned 
 Struck down but not destroyed 
 And I am blessed beyond the curse 
 For His promise will endure 
 That His joy is going to be my strength 
 Though my sorrows may last for the night 
 His joy comes with the morning 
 I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 I'm laying it down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 I'm trading my sickness 
 I'm trading my pain 
 I'm laying it down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 Joy is here, wake up 
 Joy is here, wake up 
 Joy is here, wake up 
 Joy is here, wake up 
 Joy is here, wake up 
 Joy is here, wake up 
 Joy is here, wake up 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Amen 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Amen 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Amen 
 Yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, yeah 
 Glory, glory, Hallelujah

 Glory, glory, Hallelujah 
 [Incomprehensible] I lay my burden down

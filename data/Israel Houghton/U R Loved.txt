What if it all depended on me 
 To change the world? 
 To change the world 
 What if my only responsibility 
 Was to change the world? 
 To change the world 
 Let me be the one to start a revolution 
 Let me sing my song to the people of the world 
 It all begins with 
 One, the power of one 
 Joining the hundreds of millions 
 Of people believing in one 
 The power of one 
 Don't hang around 
 Stand up or sit down 
 It all begins with one 
 What kind of love can conquer disease 
 And change the world? 
 And change the world 
 What can I do to? 
 Make poverty history 
 And change the world 
 And change the world? 
 Let me be the one to start a revolution 
 Let me sing my song to the people of the world 
 To the children of the world 
 It all begins with 
 Please don't turn away 
 Let your voices rise 
 Put love on display 
 And make a difference now 
 I believe you and me 
 Can make a difference now 
 Oh, oh, oh, it all begins with one

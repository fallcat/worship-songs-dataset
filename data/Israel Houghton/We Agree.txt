These are the days of your decree 
 What we speak will be established 
 What we bind and what we loose is bound and loosed in heaven. 
 These are the days when seasons change 
 The first is last the last is first all that you lost shall be returned lost years recovered 
 So we agree we agree 
 We believe that the famine is over 
 We believe that fruit is on the vine 
 We believe dry places are watered 
 It's the latter rain the latter rain we believe 
 Anything can happen, 
 Anything can happen when we agree 
 All things are possible nothing is impossible when we agree when we agree

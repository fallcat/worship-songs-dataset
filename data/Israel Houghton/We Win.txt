We overcome by Your Word 
 Your Word will always prevail 
 We overcome by the blood of the Lamb 
 And the promise we have in You 
 We lift our voice with a shout 
 You always cause us to trumph 
 We lift our hands like it's already done 
 For it's already won by You 
 We win because of You 
 We overcome and conquer in Your name 
 We win because of You 
 All things are possible 
 We win 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 We got the victory 
 We got the victory 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 We got the victory 
 It's all because of You 
 We win

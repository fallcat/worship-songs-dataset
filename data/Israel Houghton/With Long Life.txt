With Long life You will satisfy me, You will satisfy me, with long life 
 (2x) 
 So I will praise you forever, only you can satify 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 When I call on, You will answer 
 When I fall, You will raise me up 
 I'm protected, by Your shadow 
 Your so good, Your so good to me 
 I will praise you forever 
 (Verse) T-Bone 
 You got to give all the glory to the King of the Kings 
 And give honour and praise for long life and blessings 
 Now raise your hands, wave them up in the sky 
 And Glorify the Lord cause He's the source of my life, sing 
 You are the source of my life and hope and my life and hope is in You 
 You are the source of my life and hope and my life and hope is in You 
 (Isreal) 
 [I will live] I will live, [and not die] and not die 
 [In your presence] In your presence, [satified] satified 
 (3x) 
 (Israel) 
 [I will live] I will live, [and not die] and not die 
 You are the source of my life and hope 
 And my life and hope is in You 
 (Isreal) 
 [I will live] I will live, [and not die] and not die 
 [In your presence] In your presence, [satified] satified 
 [I will live] I will live, [and not die] and not die 
 You are the source of my life and hope lover of my soul, my future, Holy, Daily sustainer, Past redeemer, forever and ever and ever

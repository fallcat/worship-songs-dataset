All the way I choose to follow 
 All the way to where you lead 
 All the way you show your love for me 
 All the way to calvary 
 So with all my heart, my soul, my mind, my strength I love you ... 
 Oh Yahweh, 
 You're the lifter, 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 Yahweh 
 You are with us 
 You are with us all the way 
 OH OH ... All the way 
 All the way ... 
 All the way I choose to follow 
 All the way to where you lead 
 All the way you gave your life for me 
 All the way to calvary 
 So with all my heart, my soul, my mind, my strength I love you ...

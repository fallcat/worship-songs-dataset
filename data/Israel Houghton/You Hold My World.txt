Take my heart 
 Lord will you take my heart 
 As I surrender to Your will 
 I confess You are my righteousness 
 And until You move me I'll be still 
 And know that You are God. 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 And I am amazed at Your love 
 I am amazed that You love me 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 And I'm not afraid my world is safe 
 In Your hands oh 
 In Your hands 
 Take my life 
 Lord will You take my life 
 You are the reason that I live 
 I believe You have forgiven me 
 And by Your grace I will forgive 
 And know that You are God 
 And know that You are God 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 And I am amazed at Your love 
 I am amazed that You love me 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 And I'm not afraid my world is safe 
 In Your hands oh 
 In Your hands 
 You won't let go of me 
 You won't let go of me 
 You won't let go of me 
 You won't let go Never let go 
 You will take care of me 
 You will take care of me 
 You will take care of me 
 You will take care 
 Always take care 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 You hold my world 
 And you won't let go

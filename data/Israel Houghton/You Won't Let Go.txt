Never, never let go 
 Nothing can separate 
 Nothing can separate me from 
 The love that Jesus gave 
 The love that made a way for me 
 Your grace took hold of me 
 And now I walk in freedom 
 And even if I fall 
 You said You won't let go of me 
 You won't let go 
 You won't let go 
 You won't let go 
 Never let go 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 You won't let go 
 I am Yours forever 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 You won't let go 
 I am Yours forever

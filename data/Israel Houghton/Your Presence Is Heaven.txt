Who is like You Lord in all the earth 
 Matchless love and beauty, endless worth 
 Nothing in this world will satisfy 
 Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry 
 Your presence is heaven to me 
 Your presence is heaven to me 
 Treasure of my heart and of my soul 
 In my weakness, you are merciful 
 Redeemer of my past and present wrongs 
 And holder of my future days to come 
 Your presence is heaven to me, 
 Your presence is heaven to me 
 Your presence is heaven to me 
 Your presence is heaven to me 
 It's heaven to me God, so we'll sing it 
 Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus, Your presence is heaven to me 
 Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus, Your presence is heaven to me 
 All my days on earth I will await the moment that I see You face to face 
 Nothing in this world can satisfy 
 But Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry 
 Oh Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry, you never run dry 
 Your presence is heaven to me, oh whoa 
 Your presence is heaven to me 
 Lord, Your presence is heaven to me 
 Your presence is heaven to me 
 So we sing it, oh Jesus, Oh Jesus, Your presence is heaven to me 
 Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus, Your presence is heaven to me

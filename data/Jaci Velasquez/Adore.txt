From the moment You opened up my eyes 
 I have seen the world in a different light 
 From the dawn to the setting sun 
 I am overwhelmed 
 By all that You have done 
 Adore, Adore, Adore 
 Jesus I adore You, 
 Adore, 
 Adore, Adore, Adore, adore 
 Jesus, I adore You 
 And I lay my life before You, O Lord 
 There's a union of two becoming one 
 Deep inside my heart 
 I know that I belong 
 You have given everything to me 
 The least that I can do 
 Is give it back to You 
 And all I am and ever will be 
 Is for You, Lord 
 And everything within me cries 
 Adore, Adore, Adore 
 Jesus I adore You, 
 Yes I Adore You 
 And I lay my life before You 
 Adore, Adore, Adore, Adore 
 Jesus, I adore you 
 And I lay my life before You 
 I long to love and adore You 
 I lay my life before You, O Lord 
 I adore You

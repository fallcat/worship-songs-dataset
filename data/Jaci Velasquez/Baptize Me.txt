In the desert of my shame 
 I have found myself to blame 
 Now I thirst for innocence 
 And Your blood is there to quench 
 Pour Your life into my soul 
 Let the cleansing waters flow 
 Make me white as snow 
 Hear me as I pray 
 Wash my sins away 
 Draw me in Your grace 
 Baptize me 
 As my lips confess 
 Fill this emptiness 
 With Your holiness 
 Baptize me 
 Touch my eyes and give me sight 
 Father bathe me in Your light 
 At Your feet I'll always be 
 Until the day Your face I'll see 
 Let Your words consume my heart 
 Lead me to the deepest part 
 And the healing starts 
 Hear me as I pray 
 Wash my sins away 
 Draw me in Your grace 
 Baptize me 
 As my lips confess 
 Fill this emptiness 
 With Your holiness 
 Baptize me 
 Hear me as I pray 
 Wash my sins away 
 Draw me in Your grace 
 Baptize me 
 As my lips confess 
 Fill this emptiness 
 With Your holiness 
 Baptize me 
 spoken: 
 There is a river of life flowing from the throne of God 
 There is One who came by water and blood 
 There is a Spirit who testifies to this 
 Anyone who believes in the Son has this testimony in his heart 
 Behold the Lamb of God who also washes away the sins of the world 
 Baptize me 
 spoken: 
 Hear me as I pray

 Wash my sins away 
 Draw me in Your grace 
 Baptize me 
 As my lips confess 
 Fill this emptiness 
 With Your holiness

 Hear me as I pray 
 Wash my sins away 
 Draw me in Your saving grace 
 Baptize me 
 Baptize me 
 Baptize me 
 Baptize me

Tell me have you ever been 
 On the outside looking in 
 Well it's a cold and lonely place 
 Out from under heaven's grace 
 Did you ever wonder why 
 Or did it ever make you cry 
 Tears of joy when you found out 
 What His love is all about 
 It's the water that I need 
 It's the air that my heart breathes 
 And I have come to realize 
 Love is keeping me alive 
 In the shelter of Your arms I've found 
 The center of Your love is where I'm free 
 And I just want to be in the center of Your love 
 Yeah that's all I'm thinking of 
 Whoa I just want to know 
 How Your love is with me everywhere 
 Your love is with me everywhere I go 
 (Everywhere I go) 
 There is nothing I can see 
 That the world can offer me 
 What could possibly compare 
 To Your tender, loving care 
 You're the only one I've found 
 Who can make my world go 'round 
 'Cause it's only at Your side 
 Where there's meaning in my life 
 All that's in this world has let me down 
 But You are all that matters to me 
 In the shelter of Your arms I've found 
 The center of Your love is where I'm free 
 I just want to be in the center of Your love 
 Yeah that's all I'm dreaming of 
 Whoa I just want to know 
 How Your love is with me everywhere 
 Your love is with me everywhere I go 
 (Everywhere I go)

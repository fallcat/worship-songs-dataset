You decided long ago 
 To let me in to your deepest soul 
 You have given me 
 A pride of place 
 Then somehow you let it fade away 
 I know you so well 
 And I can tell 
 When you've been hiding something from me 
 Just let it go 
 Let my love flow 
 Let it bring you release 
 I have come 
 To breathe new life 
 Into the heart of a child of mine 
 I have come 
 To give you peace 
 So lift your head and believe 
 You were made 
 In a beautiful way 
 Born to be holy 
 And sure of your faith 
 Something inside you 
 Has led you astray 
 Now you're locked in a struggle 
 And it won't go away 
 I know you have been 
 Down on your knees 
 I saw you cryin' for mercy 
 Well how can I help 
 When you're still holdin' on 
 To somethin' more precious than me 
 I have come 
 To breathe new life 
 Into the heart of a child of mine 
 I have come 
 To lift you up 
 To set you free so you believe 
 It's all about total surrender 
 It's all about total surrender 
 It's all about total surrender 
 Givin' it up when the goin' gets tough 
 Givin' it up when the goin' gets rough

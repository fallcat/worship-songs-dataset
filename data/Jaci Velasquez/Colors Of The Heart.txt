Gracia, justicia, paz y verdad -- los colores. ["grace, justice, peace and truth -- the colors."] 
 What would you see if you saw me walking down your street, 
 The shade of my skin or the heart that's beating deeply within? 
 [Oh, we're*] only as different 
 As we want the difference to be. (mmm-mmm) 
 Colors may change from face to face, 
 But we're all human underneath. 
 Oh, I want the world to see (mmm-hmm) 
 The colors that live in me, 
 Grace and peace, truth and love, 
 Oh these are the colors of the heart. 
 I want the world to see 
 ([Yo quiero*] que vean mi color) ["[i want you] to see my passion (or color)"] 
 The colors that live in me, 
 ([Como el*] color del amor) ["[like the] color of love"] 
 Grace and peace, truth and love, 
 Oh these are the colors of the heart. 
 Of the heart... 
 Under the skin is the place where understanding begins. 
 It's here that I've found everybody stands on common ground. 
 Fallen people in need of the grace 
 That can heal the wounds of history, 
 And open up our jaded eyes (open up our jaded eyes) 
 To all that's good in you and me. 
 Oh, I want the world to see 
 The colors that live in me, 
 Grace and peace, truth and love, 
 Oh these are the colors of the heart. 
 Yo quiero que vean mi color ["i want you to see my passion (or color)"] 
 I want the world to see 
 Como el color del amor ["like the color of love"] 
 Colors that live in me: 
 Grace and peace, truth and love, 
 Oh these are the colors of the heart. 
 We['ve*] let the color of our skin divide us 
 And it's been going on too long; 
 The time has come to let the colors inside us 
 Come shining through and make us strong. (make us strong) 
 I want the world to see 
 The colors that live in me 
 Grace and peace, truth and love, 
 Oh these are the colors of the heart. 
 Yo quiero que vean mi color ["i want you to see my passion (or color)"] 
 I want the world to see 
 Como el color del amor ["like the color of love"] 
 Colors that live in me 
 Es su gracia, justicia, verdad, ["it's your grace, justice, truth"] 
 Los colores del corazon. ["the colors of the heart."] 
 Colors of the heart, 
 Colors of the heart. 
 Como gloria, (mmm) como gracia, justicia, paz y verdad (I want the world to see, oh) in mi corazon. 
 ("Like glory, like grace, peace, and truth in my heart.") 
 (Ooh) in mi corazon... (oh) gracia, justicia... ["in my heart... grace, justice..."]

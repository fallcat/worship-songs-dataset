You are the reason 
 For blue in the sky 
 Yes, you are the reason why 
 Snow covers winter 
 And melts into spring 
 And rivers meet the sea 
 God is here for you 
 And you were made for him 
 He'll give you more of everything 
 'Cause he has always loved you 
 His promises are true 
 So true if you 
 Come as you are 
 Don't change a thing 
 Open your heart 
 He'll walk right in 
 Come as you are 
 No alibis 
 His love for you 
 Will never die 
 There is a heaven 
 Open your eyes 
 There you have no disguise 
 He'll never leave you 
 No need to hide 
 He's always by your side 
 If you just believe 
 There is a way you'll see 
 It's just one step to eternity 
 And he will always love you 
 This promise will be true 
 So true if you

When I'm a sparrow in a winter 
 You are a seed I find 
 When I'm a heart with the splinter 
 Your hot blood keeps me alive 
 If I could call you a color 
 You'd be the deepest of blues 
 If I have my pleasure of anything 
 You'd be the One that I'd choose 
 Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for You 
 Now that I can see the mystery's revealed 
 Now I'm comin' clean 
 I can feel my fears released 
 Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for You 
 I'm soft like clay 
 Your hands they mold me 
 For You, I would run away 
 Just to hear You calling out my name 
 Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for You 
 Now that I can see the mystery's revealed 
 Now I'm comin' clean 
 I can feel my fears released 
 Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for You 
 I'm broken and empty 
 Without You, I'm blinded 
 I need You I need You near me, I need You near me 
 Ohh ohh 
 I'm falling 
 Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for You 
 Now that I can see the mystery's revealed, huh 
 Now I'm comin' clean 
 I can feel my fears released 
 Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for You 
 Please catch me, I'm falling for You 
 Please catch me, I'm falling for You 
 Please catch me, I'm falling for You 
 Please catch me, I'm falling for

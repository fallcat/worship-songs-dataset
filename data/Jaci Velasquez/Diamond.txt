I know You're messing with me 
 Doing things I can't believe 
 And I like it, yeah, I like it 
 You take imperfect away 
 Leave all that's good in place 
 And it's alright, yeah, it's alright 
 How You take an ordinary life 
 And fill it 'til it's full of light 
 Because of Your love 
 And I know You see straight through me 
 And I trust what You are doing 
 'Til I'm shining like a diamond 
 I was only a stone 
 Cast out and so alone 
 When You found me 
 Yeah You found me 
 I know that in Your eyes 
 I'm treasure, just like a prize 
 And it's so sweet 
 Yeah it's so sweet 
 How You take an ordinary life 
 And fill it 'til it's full of light 
 Because of Your love 
 And I know You see straight through me 
 And I trust what You are doing 
 'Til I'm shining like a diamond 
 Oh, let me shine 
 How You take an ordinary life 
 And fill it with light 
 Like a diamond 
 How You take an ordinary life 
 And fill it 'til it's full of light 
 Because of Your love 
 And I know You see straight through me 
 And I trust what You are doing 
 'Til I'm shining like a diamond 
 How You take an ordinary life 
 And fill it 'til it's full of light 
 Because of Your love 
 And I know You see straight through me 
 And I trust what You are doing 
 'Til I'm shining like a diamond 
 I'm shining like a diamond 
 I'm shining like a diamond 
 I'm shining like a diamond

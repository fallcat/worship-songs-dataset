You in the mirror 
 I've been spying on you 
 I see a girl, whose world 
 Is broken in two 
 I get the picture 
 That you grew up too fast 
 You've got your dreams, it seems 
 And more than you asked 
 Oo you're fading 
 Oo you're wearing thin 
 Oo you're breaking 
 Escuchame-let me save you some pain 
 Escuchame-I will show you the way 
 Mirame-you will be me some day 
 Baby don't make the same mistakes...Escuchame 
 I've got a secret 
 That'll carry you through 
 There is a God who loves 
 To look after you 
 Hey little sister 
 Don't you worry no more 
 Just come with me, you see 
 I've been there before 
 Oo the heartbreaks 
 Oo the lessons learned 
 Oo I know what it takes 
 CHORUS 
 BRIDGE 
 Words of wisdom 
 Can you hear them? 
 CHORUS

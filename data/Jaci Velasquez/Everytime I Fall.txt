Words and music by Jeremy Base and Paul Evans 
 Every time I fall a little bit harder 
 Every time I fall a little bit farther 
 Every time I fall 
 I fall right back into your arms 
 Every time I try 
 To explain the reason why 
 I have let You down 
 I fall to the ground 
 What is it You see in me 
 That makes You believe 
 No matter how far I stray 
 I will still find the way 
 Just when I think I'm not strong enough 
 You reach out to me and You lift me up 
 Time and time again 
 When I think I've reached the end 
 It's Your voice I hear 
 That draws me near 
 I don't know what makes You stay 
 When I act this way 
 No matter what we've been through 
 I can turn to You 
 Just when I think I'm not strong enough 
 You reach out to me and You lift me up 
 You find the beauty in my imperfections 
 The guiding light in all my misdirection 
 And when I think You've finally given up 
 You fill my heart with unconditional love 
 Every Time I fall 
 I fall back in Your arms

I could never leave you alone 
 How could you expect me to? 
 You need me more than you know 
 Hand me all your pain 
 And I will love you anyway 
 I will, I will, I will 
 Even 'til the end of time 
 Even if two worlds collide 
 I will never let you fall, I'll fall for you 
 Fall for you 
 Impossible to fall from grace 
 Even if you were to think 
 That you could ever lose your faith 
 Give and take it all away 
 And I will love you everyday 
 I will, I will, I will 
 Even 'til the end of time 
 Even if two worlds collide 
 I will never let you fall, I'll fall for you 
 Fall for you 
 Shout or scream, do anything 
 If you gotta let it out 
 (I'll fall for you) 
 Run or hide, I'm on your side 
 I'll never let you down 
 Even 'til the end of time 
 Even if two worlds collide 
 I will never let you fall, I'll fall 
 Even 'til the end of time 
 Even if two worlds collide 
 I will never let you fall, I'll fall 
 Fall for you 
 I'll fall, I'll fall for you 
 I'll fall, I'll fall for you

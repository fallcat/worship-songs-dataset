You are the One, there's no one else 
 Who lifts me up 
 And gives me water from the well 
 But there's a hole 
 That seems to drain it all away 
 And once again I'm left in fear 
 And doubt 
 When all my strength is crying out 
 So here I am again 
 Willing to be opened up and broken 
 Like a flower in the rain 
 Tell me what have I to do 
 To die and then be raised 
 To reach beyond the pain 
 Like a flower in the rain 
 The evil wind it blows a storm 
 To rock my world 
 Just when I think I'm safe and warm 
 I'm led astray far too easily 
 It's always hard for me to say I'm wrong 
 Until I know I can't go on 
 Lord, You have searched me 
 And know when I sleep and when I rise 
 You're familiar with all my ways 
 Even the darkness will shine 
 Like the day 
 When you look into my heart

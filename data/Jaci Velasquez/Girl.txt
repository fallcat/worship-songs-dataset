Gotta get 'em out of your mind 
 They're still in your head 
 Killing your dreams, every word they said 
 Lies bigger than life 
 At least that's how it seems 
 If it's all up to them, then I guess you'd be 
 Falling apart 
 And they wouldn't care 
 But you're breaking my heart 
 'Cause I'm well aware 
 Girl you got a way 
 Something about you that fits you perfectly 
 And girl you got a laugh that makes me smile 
 Yeah you know you're so unique 
 And don't let anybody question your style 
 Don't let 'em talk 'til they walk in your shoes 
 Just for a while 
 Fitting in can be such a fuss 
 But we make it a must 
 Can't be too real or too virtuous 
 Flirty eyes and flawless skin 
 What happened to beauty that lies within? 
 So, here's to the girls, the tan and the fair 
 You're one of a kind, beyond compare 
 Girl you got a way 
 Something about you that fits you perfectly 
 And girl you got a laugh that makes me smile 
 Yeah you know you're so unique 
 Don't let anybody question your style 
 Don't let 'em talk 'til they walk in your shoes 
 Just for a while 
 Just for a while, just for a while 
 Just look at you, really look at you 
 You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty girl 
 Don't let anybody question your style 
 Don't let 'em talk 'til they walk in your shoes 
 Girl you got a way 
 Something about you that fits you perfectly 
 And girl you got a laugh that makes me smile 
 Yeah you know you're so unique 
 Don't let anybody question your style 
 Don't let 'em talk 'til they walk in your shoes 
 Just for a little while 
 Just la-la-look at you 
 Just la-la-look at you 
 Just la-la-look at you 
 Girl

I wanna cross a borderline 
 And walk on dusty floors 
 Give up two weeks of my life 
 Feed the hungry, clothe the poor 
 I wanna drive up to a homeless man 
 Or holding up a sign 
 Handing my only twenty 
 'God bless him' as I say goodbye, but more than this 
 I wanna give them hope 
 I wanna give them peace 
 I wanna give the greatest of these 
 Give them love, love 
 I wanna tell the truth 
 And lead them to the light 
 And tell them everything will be alright 
 Give them love, give them Jesus 
 I wanna walk through something with someone 
 I wanna listen to their pain 
 Oh, I'll be a shoulder they can cry on 
 A friend who'll never walk away, but more than this 
 I wanna give them hope 
 I wanna give them peace 
 I wanna give the greatest of these 
 Give them love, love 
 I wanna tell the truth 
 And lead them to the light 
 And tell them everything will be alright 
 Give them love, give them Jesus 
 I wanna to change the world, make it a better place 
 But is it really better if we never really know, really know 
 Real hope, real peace 
 All the greatest of these, real love, love 
 I wanna give them hope 
 I wanna give them peace 
 I wanna give the greatest of these 
 Give them love, love 
 I wanna tell the truth and lead them to the light 
 And tell them everything will be alright 
 Give them love, give them Jesus, give them love, give them Jesus 
 Give them Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, give them Jesus

Come on in 
 Sometimes it feels as though my life is like a test 
 With expectations that I've got to be the best 
 Feels like everybody's always watchin' 
 One little slip gets people talkin' 
 So many unkind words are spoken 
 You see my heart is hurting 
 But it's still open 
 I have no other choice, but to let you see so 
 Come on in 'cause I know I can take it 
 You can throw those stones 
 Even tho I may be fragile 
 You're not gonna see me shatter 
 'Cause I know who I am and I won't fake it 
 I'm gonna take a stand 
 'Cause it's my faith that keeps me strong 
 That is all 
 The light is on 
 In my glass house 
 In my glass house 
 So tomoro morning when we step outside our castle 
 We think before we let the judgement calls unravel 
 Our Savior said to love one onother 
 Why must we go on hurting one another 
 Though it may be easier to run and hide 
 I'm gonna let you in 
 'Cause I can take it 
 Even though I maybe fragile 
 You're not gonna see me shatter, no 
 'Cause I know who I am and I won't fake it 
 I'm gonna take a stand 
 'Cause it's my faith that keeps me strong 
 The light is on 
 May I always find a way to give compassion 
 And remember how it hurt 
 When someone else's world is crashing 
 Lord, I pray for love, yeah 
 Come on in 'cause I know I can take it 
 You can throw those stones 
 Even though I may be fragile 
 You're not gonna see me shatter 
 No 
 'Cause I know who I am and I won't fake it 
 I'm gonna take a stand 
 'Cause it's my faith that keeps me strong 
 The light is on 
 In my glass house 
 Come on in 'cause I know I can take it 
 You can throw those stones 
 Even though I may be fragile 
 You're not gonna see me shatter 
 No 
 'Cause I know who I am and I won't fake it 
 I'm gonna take a stand 
 'Cause it's my faith that keeps me strong 
 And it's all 
 In my glass house 
 Welcome

I see the glory 
 There's glory all around in the world 
 And glory has been found -it surrounds me 
 And opens my mind and heart 
 Looking for a meaning 
 Wandering around with no direction 
 I'd rush to take that next big step 
 To make it that much more ahead 
 I went for the horizon 
 And I found the glory of Your love 
 We've been through stormy weather 
 Now I know Your love's with me forever 
 You're here to take that step with me 
 You're by my side eternally 
 I went for the horizon 
 And I found the glory of Your love 
 I went for the horizon 
 And I found the glory of Your love 
 Glory Hallelujah (x2)

In the quiet, love is reaching 
 It's yours to hold 
 Be still and know that 
 Even when you're lost and lonely 
 And hope is gone, you're not alone 
 Far beyond the understanding 
 There's a hand that leads 
 If you believe 
 Through the darkness, see the light 
 Remember God loves you 
 The road ahead is long and winding 
 With eyes of faith, you'll find the way, yeah 
 And when the journey leaves you weary 
 You can rest in the comfort of heaven's arms 
 Sweet loving arms 
 And peace will follow 
 Peace be with you always 
 As you go 
 For now you know that... 
 Through the darkness, there's a light 
 Remember God loves you 
 When you open up your heart 
 His love will meet you where you are 
 He will always be a part of everything you do 
 He is here to set you free 
 And give you all the strength you need 
 To carry on, to carry on 
 Through the darkness, see the light 
 Remember God loves you. (remember, remember) 
 Remember God loves you

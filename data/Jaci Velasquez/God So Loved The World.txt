God so loved the world 
 That He gave His one and only Son 
 That whosoever believes in Him 
 Will not perish but have everlasting life 
 I try so hard to find the words to say 
 To let you know how great is this God to whom I pray 
 Nothing can nor ever will compare 
 To the peace that flows in your soul when He is living there 
 Oh I know you've been through so much 
 It's hard to contemplate letting go and reaching out in trust 
 But I know the simple truth that love is here for you 
 So take Him at His word and see what He can do 
 God so loved the world 
 That He gave His one and only Son 
 That whosoever believes in Him 
 Will not perish but have everlasting life 
 The promise is yours and mine 
 Take hold of this love for the rest of your life 
 But it's time to take a step of faith 
 Be prepared for Jesus' love to carry you away 
 God so loved the world 
 That He gave His one and only Son 
 That whosoever believes in Him 
 Will not perish but have everlasting life, oh 
 Everlasting life, oh yeah 
 You loved me 
 God so loved the world 
 He gave, he gave His one and only Son, one and only Son 
 If you just believe, if you just believe 
 It will set you free, it will set you free 
 He loves you so much, he loves you so much 
 Just believe, just believe

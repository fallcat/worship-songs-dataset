God so loved the world 
 That he gave his one and only son 
 That who so ever believes in him 
 Will not perish but have everlasting life 
 I try so hard to find the words to say 
 To let you know how great is this God to whom I pray 
 Nothing can, nor ever, will compare 
 To the peace that flows in your soul 
 When He is living there 
 Oh, I know 
 You've been through so much 
 It's hard to contemplate 
 Letting go 
 And reaching out for his trust 
 But I know the simple truth 
 That love is here for you 
 So take Him at His word 
 And see what He can do 
 The promise is yours and mine 
 Take hold of His love for the rest of your life 
 But it's time to take a step of faith 
 Be prepared for Jesus' love to carry you one way 
 (God so loved the world) 4x 
 He gave his... 
 He gave his one and only son... 
 If you just believe 
 If you just believe 
 Love will set you free 
 He loves you so much 
 He loves you so much 
 Just believe 
 Just believe...

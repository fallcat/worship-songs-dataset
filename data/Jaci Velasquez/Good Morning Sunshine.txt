Good morning sunshine, where have you been? 
 What took so long, it's good to see you again 
 Good morning sunshine, you feel like a dream 
 I have been waiting for the promise you bring 
 It's been a long time 
 Good morning sunshine 
 Every day you find a new way to open up my eyes 
 Mercy and grace 
 Shine down on my face 
 Like sunlight from the sky 
 Good morning sunshine, where will you take me? 
 There's mountains to climb and so much to see 
 A new adventure is waiting ahead 
 I'm so excited just to get out of bed 
 Let's see what we find 
 Oh, my sweet sunshine 
 Every day you find a new way to open up my eyes 
 Mercy and grace 
 Shine down on my face 
 Like sunlight from the sky 
 Today is a new day, tomorrow's behind us 
 And we have been so blessed 
 Whatever's before us, I know with His help 
 We'll surely pass any test 
 Good morning sunshine 
 Good morning sunshine 
 Every day you find a new way to open up my eyes 
 Mercy and sweet grace 
 Shine down on our face 
 Like sunlight from the sky 
 So good morning sunshine 
 Good morning sunshine 
 You are mine 
 My only sunshine

I've given it my best shot 
 With everything that I've got 
 And still I feel I'm falling short again 
 I whistle while I'm working 
 Pretend that I'm not hurting 
 But deep inside I'm hiding all the pain 
 The more I try, the more I live a lie 
 It was love that saved me 
 You amaze me 
 But I was never too far from Your reach 
 Yesterday can't hold me 
 You took control of me 
 Conviction's overturned and I am pure 
 And I'm not guilty anymore, guilty anymore 
 I feel Your hand of mercy 
 Heal everything that's hurting 
 Your words so sweet 
 Cut right through my defense 
 You were always waiting for me 
 But I could never just see 
 If I lose myself I'll find my way to You 
 I know I don't wanna live a lie 
 It was love that saved me 
 You amaze me 
 But I was never too far from Your reach 
 Yesterday can't hold me 
 You took control of me 
 Conviction's overturned and I am pure 
 I'm not guilty anymore 
 I'm not guilty anymore 
 I know I don't wanna live a lie 
 It was love that saved me 
 You amaze me 
 But I was never too far from Your reach 
 Yesterday can't hold me 
 You took control of me 
 Conviction's overturned and I am pure 
 I'm not guilty anymore 
 No more, no more, no more, no more 
 And I'm not guilty anymore

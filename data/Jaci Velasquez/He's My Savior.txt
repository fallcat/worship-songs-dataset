He's the sunlight in my sky, He's the moon that shines at night 
 He's the rainbow over me, the river running to the sea 
 The music and the poetry, the beauty that my eyes can see 
 Still His love means so much more to me 
 He's my savior and everything within me 
 Wants to tell the world it's true 
 He's my savior if only you could open up your heart 
 You would know Him, too 
 He's the fire in my soul, He melts my heart 
 And makes me whole 
 He's the air upon my breath 
 The gentle touch of holiness 
 Just for me He gave His life and 
 In that moment paid the price 
 For all I've ever done and that is why 
 He's my savior and everything within me 
 Wants to tell the world it's true 
 He's my savior the moment that you open up your heart 
 You will know Him, too 
 I can take you there but I can't cross the line 
 It's my deepest prayer that this will be your time 
 I will vow, yeah 
 I will vow, yeah 
 Just for me He gave His life and in the moment paid the price 
 For all I've ever done and that is why 
 He's my savior my best friend 
 He's my savior He's my savior, He saved me 
 He's my savior and everything within me wants to 
 Tell the world it's true 
 He's my savior the moment that you open up your heart 
 You will know Him, too

Heaven is a place... 
 Where mothers don't have to cry for their babies 
 Wonderin' if they'll live to see 16 
 Fighting in the street for some money wonderin' if they'll ever make ends meet 
 Heaven is a place that everyone dreams of, filled with kindness flowing with the real love 
 One day I'm gonna climb those golden stairs 
 But until I get there, 
 (He) is working on me 
 (He) never leaves me 
 (He) lets me know that I am not alone in the darkness 
 (He) wants me to be happy 
 (He) smiles when I'm laughing 
 (He) makes me believe 
 Heaven's a place 
 Here, in my soul if I listen 
 There, even when I think it isn't 
 Building everywhere that I go 
 Calling out so that I can follow 
 Love is a place and it's all around us 
 Like a circle, it's around us 
 Where I wanna be, until I learn to fly 
 Until I reach the sky 
 (He) is working on me 
 (He) never leaves me 
 (He) lets me know that I am not alone in the darkness 
 (He) wants me to be happy 
 (He) smiles when I'm laughing 
 (He) makes me believe 
 Him, He knows Oh Oh 
 You know, He knows you Oh Oh He knows me too yeah 
 (He) is working on me (He's working on me) 
 (He) never leaves me (He never leaves me) 
 (He) lets me know that I am not alone in the darkness 
 (He) wants me to be happy 
 (He) smiles when I'm laughing 
 (He) makes me believe 
 Him, Oh 
 He's working on me 
 He never leaves me Oh Oh Oh 
 He's working on me 
 Yeah, HE never leaves, He always listens 
 Oh he loves me, Yeah Yeah

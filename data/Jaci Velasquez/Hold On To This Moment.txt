Sometimes in and out of sleep 
 Dreaming the same dream 
 Talking without talking 
 Berries and whipped cream 
 Sunlight across the messy bed 
 All the words we have said 
 Morning to late afternoon 
 Gazing at the moon 
 The "Do you remember when's" 
 All the places that we've seen 
 Pictures of you and me on the floor 
 I need nothing now you're here 
 All my wall have disappeared 
 Listen to your heart beat it goes 
 Boom, boom 
 Oh I'm happy right now want to stay right here 
 'Cause I want to near 
 Oh it comes so easily, we can hide away 
 And hold on to this moment, and hold on to this moment 
 Hug and a kiss and drive away 
 Passing time in thousand ways 
 Living life without a plan 
 Oh, we can remember this 
 Flashing time will be ours forever 
 Oh I'm happy right now, want to stay right here 
 'Cause I want to near 
 Oh it comes so easily, we can hide away 
 And hold on to this moment, and hold on to this 
 Wish we could show the world 
 And write it across the sky 
 And follow the sunset, you and I 
 Oh I'm happy right now, want to stay right here 
 'Cause I want to near 
 Oh it comes so easily, we can hide away 
 And hold on to this moment, and hold on to this moment

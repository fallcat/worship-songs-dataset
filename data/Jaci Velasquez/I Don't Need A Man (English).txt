I don't need a man 
 To make the call for me 
 I don't need a man 
 To break the fall for me 
 'Cause I know who I am 
 And who I wanna be (Uhmmmm) 
 There used to be a time 
 I had to win the race 
 When just to get the guy 
 Would put me in first place 
 But now its' time to fly 
 'Cause I don't need that adoration, validation just to feel alive 
 Don't get me wrong 
 I still wanna fall in love real high 
 If it's real and for the right reasons 
 And I might long for someone to come and steal my heart 
 But I don't need a man 
 I want, might want You 
 But I don't need you, no 
 Stanza 2: 
 I don't need a man 
 To wash the car for me 
 But if you do insist 
 The honey, take the keys 
 I hope you understand 
 That I don't have to have you save me just to make me feel like I'm all right 
 The road's wide open and I'm in for the ride 
 Though I'm still hoping 
 I don't wanna need us to come from the inside 
 It's amazing times are changing 
 I'm alone but who's complaining 
 I don't need no one to be someone 
 I'm already fine (oh) 
 Don't get me wrong 
 I still hope it's written in the stars 
 'Cause if it's real I'd be your one and only 
 It wont be long for someone to come and steal my heart 
 But I don't need a man 
 I want, might want You 
 But I don't need You, no (till fades)

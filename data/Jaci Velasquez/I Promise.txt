Lord, you know my heart 
 And all my desires 
 And the secret things I'll never tell 
 Lord you know them well 
 Though I may be young, 
 I see and understand 
 That at times like sheep 
 We go astray and things get out of hand 
 So I promise to be true to you 
 To live my life in purity 
 As unto you 
 Waiting for the day 
 When I hear you say 
 Here is the one I have created just for you 
 Until then O lord 
 I will be content 
 Knowing that true love 
 Will come some day 
 And will only come from you 
 'Cause I have seen the suffering that loneliness can cause 
 When we choose to give our love away 
 Without a righteous cause

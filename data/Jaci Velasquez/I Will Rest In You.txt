Lord, I'm in the dark, 
 Seems to me the line is dead when I come calling. 
 No one there, the sky is falling; 
 Lord, I need to know. 
 My mind is playing games again, 
 You're right where You have always been. 
 Take me back to You, 
 The place that I once knew as a little child; 
 Constantly the eyes of God watched over me. 
 Oh, I want to be 
 In the place that I once knew as a little child, 
 Fall into the bed of faith prepared for me. 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You. 
 Tell me I'm a fool, 
 Tell me that You love me for the fool I am, 
 [And*] comfort me like only You can, 
 And tell me there's a place 
 Where I can feel Your breath 
 Like sweet caresses on my face again. 
 Take me back to You, 
 The place that I once knew as a little child; 
 Constantly the eyes of God watched over me. 
 Oh, I want to be 
 In the place that I once knew as a little child, 
 Fall into the bed of faith prepared for me. 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You. 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You. 
 La la la la You. 
 La la la la la. 
 La la la la la-ah. 
 (You,) You la la la la You. 
 La la la la la-ah. (You.) 
 Take me back to You. 
 The place that I once knew as a little child; 
 Constantly the eyes of God watched over me 
 Oh, I want to be 
 In the place that I once knew as a little child, 
 Fall into the bed of faith prepared for me. 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You. 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You, 
 I will rest in You. 
 Oh, la la la la la 
 I will rest in You. 
 (I) I will rest in You. (in You) 
 I will rest in You. (Sweet caresses) 
 I will rest in You. 
 I will rest in You. 
 (So take me back to You) 
 I will rest in You (I, I) 
 I will rest in You.

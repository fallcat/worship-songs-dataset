I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love 
 Even more than I usually do 
 And although I know, it's a long road back 
 I promise you 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 You can count on me 
 Please have snow and mistletoe 
 And presents under the tree 
 Christmas Eve will find me 
 Where the love light leads 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 If only in my dreams 
 Oh, Christmas Eve will find me 
 Where the love light leads 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 If only in my dreams 
 If only in my dreams...

The first breath 
 A new sky 
 You hung the stars 
 And placed the sunrise 
 Painted colors 
 Yellow and green 
 And every other in between 
 From the dust 
 Became flesh and bone 
 The greatest gift I've ever known 
 I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 I feel Your arms around me 
 Your eyes of love surround me 
 I'm alive 
 To shine in pure perfection 
 And wake up every morning 
 In Your light 
 I'm so glad 
 I'm alive 
 Bare feet 
 My first steps 
 And new dreams 
 In every sunset 
 What a gift 
 That You give me every day 
 But what a price You had to pay 
 Life traveling on 
 And when my time has come 
 To say farewell 
 From dust to dust 
 But You bring me safely home 
 I take my first breath 
 I see the new sky 
 I hear the angels 
 I see my Father's eyes 
 And I know, I know

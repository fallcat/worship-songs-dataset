I'm Not Looking Down 
 I sit around 
 Waiting for the world 
 To come and let me down 
 And when I've come undone 
 You meet me where I am 
 But I cannot pretend 
 That everything makes sense 
 Help me get my feet back off the ground 
 All this thinking is killing me 
 Or am I just afraid to be 
 Help me to come back around 
 Either way now I'm not looking down 
 Underneath 
 Your sunny sky 
 I fly and I am floored by You, by You 
 Every breath you breathe 
 Has got me feeling free 
 I'm free indeed 
 Now everything makes sense 
 Either way, I'm not looking down

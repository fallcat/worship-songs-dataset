Nananananana nananana ooh, yeah (2x) 
 Do you feel you've been disowned 
 Left outside 
 In the cold 
 And without a home 
 Do you think that no one cares 
 That you're lost and alone 
 And without a prayer 
 Don't give in to the lie that there's no one you can turn to 
 Don't lose heart there is hope there is someone who will never desert you 
 If this world is a lonely place for you 
 Fall into the arms of love 
 If this world is a lonely place for you 
 There's a God that you can trust 
 He'll comfort you and lift you up 
 Nanananananana... etc 
 Are you looking for a friend 
 Who will stand by your side till the very end 
 Someone who is always true to his word 
 Be assured He won't turn from you 
 Put your faith in the One who will never let you down 
 He has proven His love, open up to all He has for you 
 He hears your cry 
 He sees your tears 
 He knows your pain 
 And all your fears 
 He waits for you 
 With open arms 
 He longs to live inside your heart 
 You'll never be alone again 
 Nananananana nanananana ooh yeah (4x)

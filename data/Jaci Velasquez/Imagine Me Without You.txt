As long as stars shine down from heaven 
 And the rivers run into the sea 
 Till the end of time forever 
 You're the only love I'll need 
 In my life You're all that matters 
 In my eyes the only truth I see 
 When my hopes and dreams have shattered 
 You're the one that's there for me 
 When I found You I was blessed 
 And I will never leave You 
 I need You 
 Imagine me without You 
 I'd be lost and so confused 
 I wouldn't last a day without 
 You there to see me through 
 Imagine me without You 
 Lord You know it's just impossible 
 Because of You it's all brand new 
 My life is now worthwhile 
 I can't imagine me without You 
 When You caught me I was falling 
 You're love lifted me back on my feet 
 It was like You heard me calling 
 And You rushed to set me free 
 When I found You I was blessed 
 And I will never leave You 
 I need You 
 Imagine me without You 
 I'd be lost and so confused 
 I wouldn't last a day without You there to see me 
 Through 
 Imagine me without You 
 Lord You know it's just impossible 
 Because of You it's all brand new 
 My life is now worthwhile 
 I can't imagine me without You

Falling all to pieces 
 While your demons rock your brain 
 Paralyzed in comfort, from the venom of your shame 
 Charming darkness trapped inside you 
 A fear you can't escape 
 Don't disappear, I'm right here 
 Come out come out, get out of your craze 
 Come on, come on, we're breaking away 
 Back into the light again 
 I know, I know that life is a maze 
 So come on, come on, 
 I'll show you the way 
 Back into the light again 
 You're coming to life again 
 Picking up the pieces, shattered promises and dreams, 
 Seemingly impossible, that you could ever be complete 
 But look at me I used to be hanging by a string 
 I made it here, your skies will clear 
 Come out come out, get out of your craze 
 Come on, come on, we're breaking away 
 Back into the light again 
 I know, I know that life is a maze 
 So come on, come on, 
 I'll show you the way 
 Back into the light again 
 Follow me, we'll get away, we'll live to see another day 
 We can bathe in the sunshine, follow me, we'll get away 
 We'll live to see another day, let's bathe in the sunshine

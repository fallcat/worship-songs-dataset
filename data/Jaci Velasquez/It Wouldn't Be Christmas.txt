We hang the lights, have snowball 
 Fights 
 And sing our favorite tunes 
 All of these are memories 
 I make each year with you 
 We decorate the douglas together 
 And watch "It's A Wonderful Life" 
 I look forward to every December 
 Because you're always here by my side 
 It wouldn't be Christmas without you 
 The season would just come and go 
 The holiday cheer would all disappear 
 Along with the sleigh bells and snow 
 Santa and eight little reindeer 
 Might as well pass on through 
 'Cause baby it wouldn't be Christmas 
 Without you 
 *From the album CHRISTMAS*

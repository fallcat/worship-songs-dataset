Funny, how we say 'It's going to be OK' 
 But funny isn't always humorous 
 It's sunny in the dark and dark in the day 
 Somehow we hope it will be all right 
 We'll make it to the light 
 Hold on, I would miss you so much 
 Don't go over something so little 
 You're wrong 'cause I finally see 
 It's not you, it's me 
 It's not you, it's me 
 Funny, how you're still my sweet fairy tale 
 Funny, how you're still my dream 
 It's crazy how you can break my heart 
 And you still are the air I breath 
 Please, don't leave 
 Hold on, I would miss you so much 
 Don't go over something so little 
 You're wrong 'cause I finally see 
 It's not you, it's me 
 It's not you, it's me 
 Don't waste time 'cause we don't have forever 
 Love's not blind or we would be together 
 Hold on, I would miss you so much 
 Don't go over something so little 
 You're wrong 'cause I finally see 
 It's not you, it's me 
 It's not you, it's me 
 I gotta forgive, I gotta let go 
 'Cause I'm the only one that I can control

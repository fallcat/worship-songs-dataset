Often, I am taken by the World 
 It sneaks up on me 
 But, eventually, You draw me back 
 To form this clay into a masterpiece 
 Oh, in spite of me 
 You see beauty 
 And Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Your mercy's new every day 
 When my heart cries out 
 All it can say is 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 You direct the path that seems astray 
 Assuring us that we will find the way 
 Help us find the way 
 Often I am shaken by your love 
 Oh it releases me 
 From the bondage of my sin 
 And through the cross 
 Adopted by your grace 
 You'll never turn your face 
 Never turn your face 
 And Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Your mercy's new every day 
 When my heart cries out 
 All it can say is 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

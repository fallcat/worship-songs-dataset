You're my best friend 
 In spite of flaws 
 I can't believe You're always there 
 You hear my prayers 
 You are my rock 
 You harbor truth 
 I can see you're light shine everywhere 
 Its all around me 
 You never judge me for my faults 
 Your love is unconditional 
 Without you I don't know where I'd be 
 Chorus 
 Jesus is...the sweet sweet love 
 of my soul 
 Jesus is...the only thing 
 making me whole 
 He's everything to me 
 All I desire to be 
 That's what Jesus is 
 That's what Jesus  is 
 Sweet comforter 
 You ease my mind 
 Always beside me constantly 
 You never leave me 
 And You know me oh so well 
 Better than I know myself 
 And Your word is all that I believe 
 Chorus 
 Your the spark of heavens light 
 The stars that shine at night 
 Here with You 
 It feels like home 
 Jesus Is...the healer of my heart 
 when it breaks 
 Jesus is...Fogiveness 
 when I make a mistake 
 He's all that I believe 
 He's everything I need 
 Thats what Jesus is 
 Chorus 
 He's all that I believe 
 He's every breath I breathe 
 That's what Jesus is 
 That's what my Jesus is

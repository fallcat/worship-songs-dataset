Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh 
 Dashing through the snow 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 O'er the fields we go 
 Laughing all the way 
 Bells on bobtail ring 
 Making spirits bright 
 What fun it is to laugh and sing 
 A sleighing song tonight 
 Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh 
 Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh 
 Now the ground is white 
 Go it while you're young 
 And take the girls tonight 
 And sing this sleighing song 
 Just get a bobtailed bay 
 Two forty as his speed 
 Hitch him to an open sleigh 
 And crack, you'll take the lead 
 Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one-horse open sleigh, yeah

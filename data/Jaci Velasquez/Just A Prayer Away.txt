Tears that fell like rain 
 Streamed down from my heart 
 Colors turned to gray 
 Emptiness led the way 
 Until I fell apart 
 You came to save me 
 To show me that 
 You're just a prayer away 
 No matter where I am 
 I know in my heart 
 You're never too far 
 When I'm losing my way 
 You're just a prayer away 
 My strength is in my faith 
 I'm never alone 
 I'm never afraid 
 'Cause you're just a prayer away 
 When I close my eyes 
 Lord, I call your name 
 And the dark subsides 
 Nothing can take the place 
 Of the peace I find 
 You came to save me 
 To show me that 
 Whenever I need to find you 
 I just fall on my knees 
 In you I find the strength that I need to live 
 To believe

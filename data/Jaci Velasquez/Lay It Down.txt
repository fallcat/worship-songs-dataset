I've been lookin' till my eyes are tired of lookin' 
 Listenin' till my ears are numb from listenin' 
 Prayin' till my knees are sore from kneelin' on the bedroom floor 
 I know that you know that my heart is achin' 
 I'm running out of tears and my will is breakin' 
 I don't think that I can carry the burden of it anymore 
 All of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans, 
 Are slowly slippin' through my folded hands 
 So I'm gonna lay it down 
 I'm gonna learn to trust You now 
 What eels can I do 
 Everything I am depends on You 
 And if the sun don't come back up 
 I know Your love will be enough 
 I'm gonna let it be, I'm gonna let it go, 
 I'm gonna lay it down. 
 I've been walkin' through this world like I'm barely livin' 
 Buried in the doubt of this hole I've been diggin' 
 But You're pullin' me out 
 I'm finally breathin' in the open air 
 This room may be dark but I'm finally seein' 
 There's a new ray of hope, and now I'm believin' 
 That the past is past, and the future's beginning to look brighter now 
 Oh, cause all of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans 
 Are safe and secure when I place them in Your hands 
 So I'm gonna lay it down 
 I'm gonna learn to trust You now 
 Oh what more can I do, 
 Cause everything I am depends on You 
 And if the sun don't come back up 
 You know Your love will be enough 
 I'm gonna let it be, I'm gonna let it go, 
 I'm gonna lay it down 
 I'm gonna lay it down 
 I'm gonna lay it down.

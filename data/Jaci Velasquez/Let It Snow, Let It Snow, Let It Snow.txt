Oh, the weather outside is frightful 
 But the fire is so delightful 
 And since we’ve no place to go 
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 It doesn’t show signs of stopping 
 And I’ve brought some corn for popping 
 The lights are turned way down low 
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 When we finally kiss good night 
 How I’ll hate going out in the storm 
 But if you really hold me tight 
 All the way home I’ll be warm 
 The fire is slowly dying 
 And, my dear, we’re still goodbying 
 As long as you love me so 
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 She doesn't care if it's in below 
 She's sitting by the fires glossy glow 
 She don't care about the cold and the winds that blow 
 She just says, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 Ooh, wee, goes the storm 
 Why should she worry when she's nice and warm? 
 Her guy by her side and the lights down low 
 She just says, let it snow, let it snow 
 Oh, the weather outside is frightful 
 But the fire is so delightful 
 And since we’ve no place to go 
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 It doesn’t show signs of stopping 
 And I’ve brought some corn for popping 
 The lights are turned way down low 
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 Let it snow 
 When we finally kiss good night 
 How I’ll hate going out in the storm 
 But if you really hold me tight 
 All the way home I’ll be warm 
 I'll be warm 
 Oh, the fire is slowly dying 
 And, my dear, we’re still goodbying 
 As long as you love me so 
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 Would you stay with me and let it snow

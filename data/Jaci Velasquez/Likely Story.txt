I'm a hopeless case 
 Just another girl in line 
 I'm not worth the chase 
 Flattered that you'd be so kind 
 You tell me that you're mine 
 I don't believe a word you say 
 It's all a waste of time 
 When you entice me with these games 
 You're disturbing me 
 When I sleep at night 
 You're possessing me 
 You consume my mind 
 This just can't be 
 Oh, oh, surely 
 A likely story 
 My Prince Charming 
 Will take me 
 Only in my dreams 
 Don't tell me 
 A likely story 
 'Cause no one like you 
 Could love someone like me 
 A Cinderella thing 
 The slipper doesn't fit so right 
 Why do you persist 
 That you need me by your side? 
 Stop pretending 
 Happy endings 
 Were never meant to be

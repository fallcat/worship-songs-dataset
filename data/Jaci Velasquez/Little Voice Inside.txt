Father, do you hear me? 
 'Cause I know I hear you 
 I waited for the answers 
 While sitting here in my room 
 I dance to the rythyn 
 And moved by myself 
 No one could see through me 
 Or hear the words I felt... 
 Little voice inside - keeps calling 
 Little voice inside - it cries 
 Little voice inside - keeps calling 
 Little voice - oh won't you be my guide? 
 I sometimes hear the cho 
 The pattern of my cry 
 I sometimes feel the pulling 
 From a sound that's deep insisde 
 Quiet are the whispers 
 And silent are my eyes 
 No one hears me 
 That little voice inside you see... 
 Little voice inside - keeps calling 
 Little voice inside - it cries 
 Little voice inside - keeps calling 
 Little voice - oh won't you be my guide?

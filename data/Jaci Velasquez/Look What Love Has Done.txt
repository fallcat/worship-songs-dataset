Where once the moon 
 Was just a rock spinning in the sky 
 Where once the stars 
 Were only tiny points of light 
 Now the moon looks like 
 It's heaven's shining pearl 
 Now those stars -- they look like 
 Windows into another world 
 Look what Love has done to me 
 Look what Love has done 
 There's poetry in all I see 
 Look what Love has done 
 And my heart is dancing through each day 
 My soul is running free 
 Look what Love has done to me. 
 Where once each breath 
 Was just a sigh of aching emptiness 
 Where once I hardly felt 
 The beating in my chest 
 Now each breath feels like 
 A precious kiss of life 
 Now inside me beat the 
 Wings of a thousand butterflies 
 Look what Love has done to me 
 Look what Love has done 
 This must be how it's meant to be 
 Look what Love has done 
 And my heart is dancing through each day 
 My soul is running free 
 Look what Love has done to me 
 And I can't tell 
 Was that a violin, or did You say something 
 Was that lightning striking where I stand 
 Or did You just reach out and take my hand

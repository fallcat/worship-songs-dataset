I know I can be a little stubborn 
 Sometimes 
 You might say, 
 A little righteous andtoo proud 
 I was lookin' for a way to compromise 
 Thinkin' maybe I could work things out 
 I thought I had all the answers 
 Never givin' in 
 But You loved me all along 
 And I admit I was wrong 
 All I know is I'm lost without You 
 I'm not gunna lie 
 I could never be strong without You 
 I need you be my side 
 If I ever thought we'd never be together 
 'Cause of all my foolish pride 
 Don't know what I'd do 
 I'm lost without You 
 I keep tryin' to find my way 
 But all I know is 
 I'm lost without You 
 I keep tryin' to face the day 
 I'm lost without You 
 You're the only one 
 Who gets rid of these blues 
 When I fall You'll catch me every time 
 The way You give me clarity 
 When I'm comfused 
 Just to hear Your voice 
 Can ease my mind 
 Oh my world's so cold at night 
 When I wander far away 
 Only You can make it right 
 No I'm not too proud to say 
 I keep tryin' to find my way 
 But all I know is 
 I'm lost without You 
 I keep tryin' to face the day 
 I'm lost without You 
 I know that You can hear me now 
 Make the pain just go away 
 Stop all the all the tears from 
 Running down my face 
 Lord 
 I keep tryin' to find my way 
 But all I know is 
 I'm lost without You 
 I keep tryin' to face the day 
 I'm lost without You

Hear the cry, tearful eyes 
 Can't deny and wish it all away (whoa) 
 Will the pain ever change? 
 If we save love for another day (whoa) 
 This is the time 
 For us to see the vision 
 Now is the time 
 To break the silence and 
 Love out loud 
 Let your loving be your voice 
 (Everybody, come on now) 
 Love out loud 
 Together we can make some noise 
 Love out loud 
 Without Fear 
 Sing a song and let the whole world hear 
 Love out loud 
 Be His hands, be His feet 
 Be the people we are called to be (whoa) 
 Take His love to the streets 
 Show compassion to a soul in need (whoa) 
 This is the time to break the silence and 
 Love out loud 
 Let your loving be your voice 
 (Everybody, come on now) 
 Love out loud 
 Together we can make some noise 
 Love out loud 
 Without Fear 
 Sing a song and let the whole world hear 
 Love out loud 
 Hush, listen to my heart 
 Can you hear me crying out 
 Willing to believe 
 That touch, is loving more than words 
 It's living out for all to see the light that shines through me 
 Love out Loud, everybody come on now 
 Love out loud 
 Let your loving be your voice 
 (Everybody, come on now) 
 Love out loud 
 Together we can make some noise 
 Love out loud 
 Without Fear 
 Sing a song and let the whole world hear 
 Love out loud

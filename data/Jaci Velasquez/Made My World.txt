I never thought of what I could be 
 Where I'd go 
 What I'd do 
 I never thought of what I should be 
 Until you 
 You came into my life 
 When I was all alone 
 You came down 
 And saved my soul 
 When I found my world was crashing 
 And I thought I'd lost my passion 
 You came and laid a hand 
 On this little girl 
 When I thought my dreams were fading 
 I looked up and saw you waiting 
 You reached your hand down 
 And you made my world 
 I never thought of where I might be 
 If I turned away from you 
 I never thought of all I would need 
 Without you 
 You came into my life 
 When I was all alone 
 You came down 
 And saved my soul 
 You came down 
 When I was all alone 
 You came down 
 You came down 
 And saved my soul 
 Oh, you made my world 
 You came and changed it all

Reaching, searching for some way 
 So much emotion to convey 
 Loving Father hear me as I offer 
 (My alleluia) 
 Hear beyond the words I bring 
 (My alleluia) 
 The song my speechless heart still sings 
 (My alleluia) 
 And hear my prayer when my words fail 
 Falling presence my true home 
 Send Your mercy, draw me close 
 Holy Father I place on the altar 
 (My alleluia) 
 Hear beyond the words I bring 
 (My alleluia) 
 The song my speechless heart still sings 
 (My alleluia) 
 And hear my prayer when my words fail, fail, fail 
 (My alleluia) 
 Hear beyond the words I bring 
 (My alleluia) 
 The song my speechless heart still sings 
 (My alleluia) 
 Find it pleasing in your sites 
 (My alleluia) 
 And hear my prayer when my words fail 
 Reaching, searching for some way

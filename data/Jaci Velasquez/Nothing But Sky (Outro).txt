I'm here 
 With all the scars and the tears 
 I've survived 
 It takes time 
 To find forgiveness 
 Get on with my life 
 I've gone through the heartache 
 Learned from the pain 
 Walked through 
 The broken, and all that remains 
 Is a heart that's wide open 
 Ready and willing to fly 
 Now, there's nothing but sky 
 Nothing but sky 
 It's clear 
 That what doesn't kill you 
 Makes you strong 
 I'm here 
 Right where I should be 
 In your tender arms 
 I've gone through the heartache 
 Learned from the pain 
 Walked through 
 The broken, and all that remains 
 Is a heart that's wide open 
 Ready and willing to fly 
 Now, there's nothing but sky 
 Nothing but sky 
 Nothing but blue sky around me 
 Nothing but sky 
 Nothing but this moment now 
 Floating high above the clouds 
 It's all I need, You here with me 
 I've gone through the heartache 
 Learned from the pain 
 Walked through 
 The broken, and all that remains 
 Is a heart that's wide open 
 Ready and willing to fly 
 Now, there's nothing but sky 
 Nothing but sky 
 There's no sign of rain 
 Ain't no clouds in my way 
 Nothing but blue sky around me 
 Nothing but sky

O little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in the dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting Light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight 
 For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above 
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep 
 Their watch of wondering love 
 Oh morning stars together proclaim the holy birth 
 And praises sing to God the King 
 And peace to men on earth 
 How silently, how silently the wonderous gift is given 
 So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heaven 
 No ear may hear His coming but in this world of sin 
 Where meeks souls will receive Him still 
 The dear Christ enters in 
 O holy Child of Bethlehem 
 Descend to us we pray 
 Cast out our sin and enter in 
 Be born in us today 
 We hear the Christmas angels 
 The great glad tidings tell 
 O come to us, abide with us 
 Our Lord Emmanuel (Emmanuel... Emmanuel)

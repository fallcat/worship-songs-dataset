There are days when I feel the best of me is ready to begin 
 Then they're days when I feel I'm letting go and soaring on the wind 
 'Cause I've learned in laughter or in pain how to survive 
 I get on my knees, I get on my knees 
 There I am before the love that changes me 
 See I don't know how but there's power when I'm on my knees 
 I can be in a crowd or by myself or almost anywhere 
 When I feel there's a need to talk with God, he is Emmanuel 
 When I close my eyes, no darkness there 
 There's only light 
 I get on my knees, I get on my knees 
 There I am before the love that changes me 
 See I don't know how but there's power in the blue skies, in the midnight 
 When I'm on my knees 
 I get on my knees, I get on my knees 
 There I am before the love that changes me 
 See I don't know how but there's power when I'm on my 
 Oh, When I'm on my 
 When I'm on my knees

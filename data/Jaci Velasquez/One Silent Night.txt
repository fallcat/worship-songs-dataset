 All is calm and all is bright (ba ba ba ba ba) 
 Holy (all is calm, all is bright) night 
 All is calm and all is bright (ba ba ba ba ba) 
 Sleep in heavenly peace

 That he gave his one and only son (ba ba ba ba ba) 
 That whosoever believes in him 
 Will not perish but have everlasting (sleep in heavenly peace) life 
 Sleep in heavenly peace, yeah 
 Sleep in heavenly peace (heavenly peace), yeah, oh 
 Christ the savior is born... 
 spoken: 
 On a cold moonlit night 
 In the sleepy town of bethlehem, 
 Born in silence, in holiness, 
 In beauty and tenderness... 
 It all came together one precious moment, 
 The promise, the purpose, the gift of our savior. 
 But it's time to take a step of faith, 
 Be prepared for Jesus' love to carry you away...

Heart pounds 
 To the sound 
 Comin' after me 
 Step back 
 What is that? 
 It's a mystery 
 Is it somethin' 
 Probably nothing 
 Still I find a way 
 To scare my self 
 Till I remember 
 This all feels familiar 
 And I know better. 
 They are only paper tigers following me 
 In the wild imagination of the make believe 
 And there's a fighter a survivor 
 Arising in me 
 I'm not afraid of paper tigers 
 Night brings 
 Creepy things 
 And I hide away 
 False fears disappear 
 In the light of day 
 The sun is rising 
 I'm realizing 
 The only thing to fear is fear itself 
 Now I'm certain 
 That my best of burden 
 Isn't worth the worry 
 ...And I won't run away from Paper Tigers...

When I'm in trouble, You rescue me 
 When I'm alone in my soul, You're here with me 
 Always unconditional when I need a friend 
 You hold me and You're strong, but gentle enough to bend 
 You know my name when I call, You don't forget me when I fall 
 You're my anchor, You're my wings 
 And I know You're listening 
 Love save me 
 Oh Lord make me 
 A reflection of Your love 
 Capture me, don't set me free 
 Surround me with Your love 
 Let me see through Your eyes, touch me with grace 
 When You color my world, it's such a beautiful place 
 I put all my faith in You, I'll go where You want me to 
 You'll be there with open arms 
 When I have a fragile heart 
 The closer I am to You lord 
 The nearer I am to love 
 Place the path to You before me 
 Keep Your hand above 
 This is my prayer to

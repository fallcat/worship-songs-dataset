There's something more to this 
 The stories I have heard 
 Of senseless apathy and cases of defeat 
 The course that we are on 
 Is treacherous and long 
 Sometimes is so unreal 
 But I know what to feel 
 We are in need 
 Of something real 
 To prove that life is something, not just nothing 
 Everybody wants to see everyone is here in need 
 Of the reason to believe, the reason to believe 
 We all want to rise above, yeah we're all in search of love 
 And the reason to believe, the reason to believe 
 We're living in an age 
 Of faith and disbelief 
 And curiousity of how we can be free 
 The state that we are in 
 We question everything 
 But I know right, 'cause I can see the light 
 The reason to believe 
 Yeah yeah 
 The reason to believe

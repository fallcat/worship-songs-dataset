Where a prayer could be enough 
 Our hands open up and give a little 
 More 
 Crowded hearts make room 
 Kindness falls like the snow 
 Tenderness like a row of dominoes 
 Season of love 
 A chance to shine in the darkness 
 To be hope, to give joy 
 All over the world it's Christmas 
 The season of love 
 Christ is here with us 
 In our hearts, through our hands 
 Love is the season 
 Holy infant Son of God 
 You are the light inside of every one 
 Of us 
 Miracle on earth 
 We see your star, feel your peace 
 You are why this will always be the 
 Season of love 
 A chance to shine in the darkness 
 To be hope, to give joy 
 All over the world it's Christmas 
 The season of love 
 Christ is here with us 
 In our hearts, through our hands 
 Love is the season 
 Love is the season

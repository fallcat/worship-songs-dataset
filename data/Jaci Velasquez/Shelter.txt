How the mind can wander 
 How the heart can stray 
 Suddenly you're on the edge of darkness 
 How it makes me ponder 
 How I'm led away 
 Down a path that leaves me worn and tarnished 
 Battling with the will within 
 I have known all along 
 That I should lean on you 
 'Cause I'm never strong enough to fight it on my own 
 Shelter me 
 The ways of the world are at my feet 
 Shelter me 
 From the desires that deceive 
 You are the fortress I need 
 Shelter me 
 How the mind can alter 
 How hte heart can change 
 When you set your sights on holiness 
 And though at times you falter 
 It's the only way 
 You can find a place of peace to rest 
 Safe from danger surrounding me 
 Safe from looming defeat 
 When temptation is at my door 
 Lord, I need a harbor be my soul's retreat 
 You will never leave me stranded fending for myself 
 When the enemy advances you are there to help 
 Enough to fight it on my own

You will make the change 
 And you'll begin today 
 You will turn around and 
 See the world another way 
 You'll stand up tall 
 And move with grace 
 And you will see yourself 
 In every face, every face 
 You'll open up your eyes 
 Like the sunrise 
 Your heart will fly and you'll realize 
 What a gift is to be alive, be alive 
 Be alive. 
 Shine... Shine on 
 Shine... Shine on 
 On and on 
 You will feel the heat 
 So soft, so sweet 
 You will listen long and well 
 Before you humbly speak 
 You'll walk that mile 
 Be the first to smile 
 To reach out you hand and 
 Reconcile, reconcile 
 And in the end you'll make amends 
 Be a true friend, strong enough to bend 
 Be grateful when you start again, 
 Start again 
 When you start again.

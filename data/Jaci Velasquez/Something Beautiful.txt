To pick up the pieces 
 Of all my promises 
 I might as well say I'm good enough 
 Only when failing 
 In need of saving 
 Can I surrender my life to yours 
 When it's all said and done 
 Let this be real 
 This strength from above 
 I hope they see 
 Something beautiful 
 Something wonderful 
 You are supernatural 
 The way You change my life 
 To something beautiful 
 I've taken chances 
 I've tried out romances 
 I want to breath in 
 All You've given me 
 Stepping out means I'm 
 Tripping and falling 
 Your loving hand would never let me 
 Let me hit the floor 
 When it's all said and done 
 Let this be real 
 This strengt from above 
 I hope they see

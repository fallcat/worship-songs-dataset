How I wonder why 
 Didn't you feel something? 
 Wasn't your heart jumping? 
 Didn't you have chills running down your spine? 
 Weren't you infatuated? 
 Weren't you illuminated? 
 Didn't you hear music playing? 
 I wonder why 
 I saw clouds breaking 
 Felt my whole world changing 
 So how could you just say it 
 "Goodbye" 
 Didn't it mean something 
 Surely you felt something 
 How could there be nothing 
 In your eyes 
 Come on and say something 
 Baby, you gotta do something 
 How could there be nothing 
 There inside 
 I wonder why 
 Footsteps down the hall 
 Another tear on my face 
 Words you'll never say 
 Race through my mind 
 Didn't it mean something 
 Surely you had to feel something 
 How could there be nothing 
 In your eyes 
 Come on and say something 
 Baby, you gotta do something 
 Don't leave me here all by myself 
 Didn't it mean something 
 Surely you had to feel something 
 How could there be nothing 
 In your eyes 
 I saw clouds breaking 
 Felt my whole world changing 
 So how could you be saying 
 "Goodbye"

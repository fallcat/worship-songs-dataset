What have I to offer 
 To a world in need 
 Yet for some unknown reason 
 You have chosen me 
 Lord You've set my journey 
 You've prepared the way 
 Still, I'm desperate for the words to say 
 All I am is willing 
 All I have is in Your hands 
 Speak for me, this my plea 
 Say the words I can't express 
 Sing for me a heavenly melody 
 That the people will be blessed 
 Speak for me 
 Every brief encounter 
 That You send my way 
 Is it just to show the love You gave me? 
 I see their troubled faces 
 A hunger deep inside 
 Lord, I depend on You to touch their lives 
 Light what burns within me 
 Let Your truth shine through my life 
 Sing for me, set me free 
 And they will see Your holiness 
 Speak for me 
 ('Cause Your love will lead them on to heaven's gate 
 Where they can look upon Your face) 
 You're all I have to offer to a world in need.

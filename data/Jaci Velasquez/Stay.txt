Hey now, hey now 
 Before I let you go away 
 Hey now slow down 
 There's a few things I must say 
 I know you know 
 There is gonna be a day 
 When I hear you say 
 You know I just can't stay 
 Though the birds are singing outside 
 My heart is still breaking deep inside 
 You and I are saying goodbye 
 But you just gotta stay 
 Hey now, hey now 
 We said it was you and me 
 But right now, some how 
 I can't let you leave 
 You don't have to go away 
 I'll be begging you to stay.

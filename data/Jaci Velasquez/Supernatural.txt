I've been listening 
 To doubt 
 She is all around me 
 Forcing her way 
 Into my heart 
 Till I can't resist 
 Then I feel grace 
 Make me believe in this 
 Supernatural thing 
 Supernatural 
 I'll do anything 
 To see Your face 
 Supernatural 
 I'll do anything 
 Anything 
 I have read every verse 
 But yet I still search 
 To bring down the light 
 But I'm in the way 
 And can't comprehend 
 But You take me back to when 
 I believed in this 
 Supernatural 
 I'll do anything 
 To see Your face 
 Supernatural 
 I'll do anything 
 Anything 
 How can I begin to understand 
 It could take a lifetime 
 Where did this journey start 
 And where will it go... 
 Supernatural 
 I'll do anything 
 To see Your face 
 Supernatural 
 I'll do anything 
 Anything

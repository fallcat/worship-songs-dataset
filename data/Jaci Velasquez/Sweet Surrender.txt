It's not a mysterious wind, and 
 It's not the thunder willing in 
 It's the spirit that I feel within that's calling 
 I understand but I can't explain 
 Now I see love in a different way 
 And with the sing leap the faith 
 I'm falling 
 Into Your loving arms 
 Showing no resistance 
 There's a peace that flows over me 
 Sweet surrender 
 Love me tender 
 You have captured my desire and heart completely 
 Sweet surrender 
 Yours forever 
 I will gladly give my all to You 
 Receive me 
 Oh Lord I am Yours 
 Your love of us has no escape 
 But I don't feel the need to run away 
 My heart has found a place to stay here with You 
 Nothing else could satisfy 
 The deep void that I had inside 
 From all the multiple battles I had lived through 
 Now here in Your loving arms 
 I have gone the distance 
 I will rest my soul in Your embrace 
 Sweet surrender 
 Love me tender 
 You have captured my desire and heart completely 
 Sweet surrender 
 Yours forever 
 I will gladly give my all to You 
 Receive me 
 'Cause I have gone the distance 
 I will rest my soul in Your embrace 
 Sweet surrender 
 Love me tender 
 You have captured my desire and heart completely 
 Oh Lord I am Yours 
 Oh Lord I am Yours

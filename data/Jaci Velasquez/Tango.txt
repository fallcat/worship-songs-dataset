Love is a fiery dance of give and take 
 The game of tug of war 
 Can be so tantalizing 
 We tend to fight over 
 Who's right, who's wrong 
 We push the buttons 
 That keep the tension rising 
 Whay-oh, oh whay-oh 
 Whay-oh, oh whay-oh, 
 I think it's time to tango 
 Whay-oh, Oh Whay-Oh, Whay-Oh, Oh-whay 
 Sometimes you gotta tango 
 You like to keep it civilized and calm 
 I like the drama 
 It exposes all the feelings 
 We won't resolve it 
 If we both shut down 
 We gotta work it out 
 Before we hit the ceiling 
 Whay-oh, oh whay-oh 
 Whay-oh, oh whay-oh, 
 I think it's time to tango 
 Whay-oh, Oh Whay-Oh, Whay-Oh, Oh-whay 
 Sometimes you gotta tango 
 Que se Muevan ("That they move") 
 Que se Baila ("That it's danced") 
 Let's dance together 
 Baby you and me 
 Can't let our differences 
 Ever come between us 
 We'll find the rhythm 
 If we meet halfway 
 Let's not get feisty 
 Just because we're Mars and Venus

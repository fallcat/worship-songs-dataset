Today I had one of those days 
 Where every step I tried to take ended with me on my face. 
 My confidence crumbles like dust 
 Right now my mistakes are so much bigger than my trust. 
 Won't be the last time, 
 But it you don't mind 
 Tell me again 
 That I am loved 
 Tell me again 
 My heart cannot hear it enough 
 I know you're in control. 
 But the fear inside my head says 
 Something different to my soul 
 Only you can stop this noise 
 Come and drown out all my doubt 
 And let me hear your voice 
 I'm ashamed to even ask 
 It's been underlined 
 You have told me before 
 Now I'm asking you one more time 
 Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! 
 Tell me again

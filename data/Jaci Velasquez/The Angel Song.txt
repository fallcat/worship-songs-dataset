In the chill of the night 
 While the moon gently sleeps 
 I wander in silence on snow-laden 
 Streets 
 As I gaze into sunsets over silhouette 
 Mountains 
 I am amazed that the God who made 
 All this, made me 
 As my eyes were open I began 
 To believe 
 The mystery of Christmas was truly 
 Revealed 
 A great host of angels came calling 
 To me 
 Taking me back to the pure sacred 
 Peace 
 Singing la, la, lalala, lalalala, lalalalalala 
 There's a savior born to us today 
 Singing la, la, lalala, lalalala, lalalalalala 
 The Messiah, Christ the Lord 
 In the light of the angels surrounding 
 My soul 
 I know for certain I'm never alone 
 Now let all of your children feel the 
 Love that you gave 
 And in honor of you give it away

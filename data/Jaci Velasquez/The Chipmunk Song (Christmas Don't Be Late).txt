 Christmas, Christmas time is near 
 Time for toys and time for cheer 
 We've been good, but we can't last 
 Hurry Christmas, hurry fast 
 Want a plane that loops the loop 
 Me, I want a hula hoop 
 We can hardly stand the wait 
 Please Christmas, don't be late. 
 Okay fellas get ready. 
 That was very good, Simon. 
 Naturally. 
 Very good Theodore. 
 Ah 
 Ah, Alvin, you were a little flat, watch it. 
 Ah, Alvin. 
 Alvin. 
 Alvin! 
 Okay 
 Want a plane that loops the loop 
 I still want a hula hoop 
 We can hardly stand the wait 
 Please Christmas, don't be late. 
 We can hardly stand the wait 
 Please Christmas, don't be late. 
 Very good, boys 
 Lets sing it again! 
 Yeah, lets sing it again! 
 No, that's enough, lets not overdo it 
 What do you mean overdo it? 
 We want to sing it again! 
 Now wait a minute, boys 
 Why can't we sing it again? 
 Alvin, cut that out 
 Theodore, just a minute. 
 Simon will you cut that out? Boys

People think I've got it all together 
 With the show of my sweet, sweet smile 
 But do they know if I've been happy ever 
 Pull up a chair 'cause this may take a while 
 Okay, so here's the thing 
 I've got my bad days 
 And some are even worse 
 I can be a blessing 
 And you know, I can be a curse 
 I tremble at rejection 
 I'm scared to be alone 
 Sometimes I may be selfish 
 But I always make it home 
 This is the real me 
 Am I the girl that you want me to be 
 This is the real me 
 With flaws and fears of intimacy 
 This is the real me 
 Can you face it 
 Can you feel it 
 Can you take it 
 Can you deal with 
 The real me 
 So now you see that I am far from perfect 
 I will fall and I will make mistakes 
 But I am here and this has taken courage 
 Will you abandon me or will you stay 
 I know that I'm demanding 
 And sometimes insecure 
 I think I've got the answers 
 But then I'm not so sure 
 I sometimes need attention 
 A little more than I should 
 But there is a part of me 
 That give the whole world if I could 
 Now that I've gone and let you in 
 And I no longer will pretend 
 Will you please still be my friend

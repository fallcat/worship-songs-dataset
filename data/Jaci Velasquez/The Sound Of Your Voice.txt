You spoke and light came to be 
 You spoke and carved out the seas 
 You stretched out the heavens 
 Holding the stars in their place 
 You spoke a marvelous plan 
 You spoke, breathed life into man 
 Creation displaying Your beauty 
 In wondrous array 
 The sound of Your voice echoes forever 
 The sound of Your voice holds us together 
 There's nothing more powerful 
 Nothing more glorious than the sound of Your voice 
 You speak calling my name 
 You speak and I'm never the same 
 How my heart thrills 
 As You whisper away all my fear 
 You speak of a kingdom to come 
 You speak of an army of love 
 Who'll go to the nations 
 Inviting the broken to hear, come and hear 
 The sound of Your voice echoes forever 
 The sound of Your voice holds us together 
 There's nothing more powerful 
 Nothing more glorious than the sound of Your voice 
 And down through the ages, a melody races 
 It chases the darkness away 
 For all who will listen there's hope and forgiveness 
 In love that has conquered the grave 
 The sound of Your voice echoes forever 
 The sound of Your voice holds us together 
 There's nothing more powerful 
 Nothing more glorious 
 There's nothing more powerful 
 Nothing more glorious than the sound of Your voice

Before the winter chill has gone, 
 The springtime rivers rise. 
 Before the setting sun has disappeared, 
 The moon is rising high. 
 And time waits for no man; 
 Seasons come and go. 
 In the midst of an ever-changing world, 
 This one thing I know: 
 You've got to live every moment 
 As though it was your last, 
 Before the thief of always 
 Steals tomorrow from your grasp. 
 Before the chance to know His love 
 Has somehow passed you by, 
 Let your heart reach out, right here, right now, 
 For the Lord to touch your life. 
 Before the trees have shed 
 Their autumn gold to leave the barest bark, 
 The frost beneath our feet will sparkle bright, 
 Like crystals under the sky. 
 And time waits for no man; 
 Seasons come and go. 
 In the midst of an ever-changing world, 
 This one thing I know: 
 You've got to live every moment 
 As though it was your last, 
 Before the thief of always 
 Steals tomorrow from your grasp. 
 Before the chance to know His love 
 Has somehow passed you by, 
 Let your heart reach out, right here, right now, 
 For the Lord to touch your life. 
 Don't ever doubt that God can lift us high. 
 Allow the flame of Heaven to be our guide. 
 Live every moment 
 As though it was your last, 
 Before the thief of always 
 Steals tomorrow from your grasp. 
 Before the chance to know His love 
 Has somehow passed you by, 
 Let your heart reach out, right here, right now, 
 For the Lord to touch your life. Oh...

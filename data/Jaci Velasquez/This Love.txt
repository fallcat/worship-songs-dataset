Love has got a way 
 Of making colors fade 
 No intentions here, prejudice or fear 
 There are no rules to play 
 Or judgments to be made 
 If beauty has grace, Let her stay 
 Heaven is a place that we can run to 
 Me and You 
 In God's eyes we're all the same 
 So be you and I'll be me 
 Don't be afraid 'cause in the light 
 There is no weight 
 Have faith 
 This love is for everyone 
 Silence is a spell 
 Lose your sense of self 
 I'm trying to explain 
 This liberating change 
 No formula or key 
 It's all for free 
 Wherevere your faith 
 Whether you're changed 
 It's ok there are no conditions 
 Loving arms will never fail

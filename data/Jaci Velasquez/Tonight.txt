Sometimes I feel the rain 
 Fall on the twilight of the day 
 Watch the world fade away 
 Through all the stains of time 
 In the far corner of my mind 
 All the dreams I left behind 
 You'll find 
 But tonight, I'm gonna live in your world 
 Where the stars come out and find you beautiful 
 Yeah tonight, I wanna live in your world 
 Where the stars come out and call you beautiful 
 Once I felt it all 
 The fear and freedom of the fall 
 Empty rooms and barren walls 
 And now the cold remains 
 From all the fallout of the day 
 Let it all fade away 
 I pray 
 That tonight, I'm gonna live in your world 
 Where the stars come out and find you beautiful 
 Yeah tonight, I wanna live in Your world 
 Where the stars come out and call you beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Won't you come out 
 Won't you come out tonight 
 Tonight, I'm gonna live in your world 
 Where the stars come out and find you beautiful 
 Yeah tonight, I wanna live in your world 
 Where the stars come out and call you beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Beautiful

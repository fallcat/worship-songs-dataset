I used to think that I'd be better off 
 If I could only know the end result 
 I used to ask you why, and hang my head and cry 
 As if you never catch me when I fall 
 Everyone's afraid 
 When the winds start blowing 
 But they're just winds of change 
 All I need to know 
 Is you're in control 
 And you know just what to do 
 I don't need to see 
 What I really need 
 Is a little more trust in you 
 It's hard to face my fear and let it go 
 When these seeds of faith have turned to stone 
 If I could just believe, I'd throw this mountain to the sea 
 And on this path I never walk alone 
 Everyone's afraid 
 When the wind starts blowing 
 But you're always the same 
 I'm reaching out, take my hand 
 Savior please rescue me 
 I'll make it through and follow you 
 And I will believe 
 All I can do is trust in you

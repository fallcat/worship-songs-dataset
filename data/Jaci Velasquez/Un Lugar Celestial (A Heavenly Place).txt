Sometimes I realize when I gaze in the skies 
 This spinning world is not my home 
 A place of mystery, a place of destiny 
 Is where I know one day I'll go 
 I dream of beauty I have never seen 
 I know the arms of heaven wait for me 
 And yet I feel its sweetness here and now 
 In this life on earth, I have found 
 CHORUS 
 Un lugar celestial 
 Just a little bit of heaven sent from up above 
 Un lugar celestial 
 Where the presence of my Father 
 Holds me in His love 
 Un lugar celestial 
 When all my skies are gray 
 I simply steal away 
 Into my secret hiding place 
 When hearts are cold as ice 
 The breath of paradise 
 Blows warm and gentle on my face 
 I know I need my time alone with Him 
 His healing waters flowing deep within 
 Don't have to wish upon a distant star 
 'Cause the light of love fills my heart 
 REPEAT CHORUS 
 El cielo me llamo (Heaven is calling me) 
 Caminando en las nubes (Walking on the clouds) 
 Dulse beso de libertad (Sweet kiss of liberty) 
 Nubes de gloria (Clouds of glory) 
 REPEAT CHORUS

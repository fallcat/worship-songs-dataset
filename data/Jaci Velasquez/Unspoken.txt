I hear daily news 
 People cry out for their freedom 
 My eyes turn to You 
 Don't they know Lord 
 You can lead them 
 If we all pray for peace 
 Change will come I believe 
 As we face the unknown 
 God heals us when we're broken 
 He is there, use your voice 
 Reach for Him 
 Make a choice 
 None of us are alone 
 Don't leave your heart unspoken 
 God heals us when we're broken 
 Don't leave your heart unspoken 
 I pray, save our souls 
 Help us find a new direction 
 We're lost in the cold 
 Let Your arms be our protection 
 If we all pray for peace 
 Change will come I believe 
 As we face the unknown 
 God heals us when we're broken 
 He is there, use your voice 
 Reach for Him 
 Make a choice 
 None of us are alone 
 Don't leave your heart unspoken 
 God heals us when we're broken 
 Don't leave your heart unspoken 
 Out of the dark 
 Into the light 
 He is there for us 
 With all His might 
 He has the answers 
 He hears your prayers 
 Turn every corner and you'll find Him there 
 Don't leave your heart unspoken 
 If we all pray for peace 
 Change will come I believe 
 As we face the unknown 
 God heals us when we're broken 
 He is there, use your voice 
 Reach for Him 
 Make a choice 
 None of us are alone 
 Don't leave your heart unspoken 
 God heals us when we're broken 
 Don't leave your heart unspoken

 Repeat 
 Come on now 
 We live in a dream 
 If we really think 
 Everything's all right 
 (Yeah) 
 This world is in need 
 Crying out to be freed 
 We gotta shed some light 
 (Oh) 
 Teach the world to smile 
 (And hear angels sing) 
 Feel the breath of God 
 (And the power it brings) 
 It's time to come together, you and I 
 And share the love of Jesus Christ 
 We can make a difference 
 We can make a change 
 We can make the world a better place 
 We can make a difference 
 We can make a change 
 We can make the sun shine through the rain 
 Shine on through the rain 
 Do do do do do

 Do do do do do do do 
 Do you know a man 
 Who's needing a hand? 
 Don't ya walk on by 
 (Oh) 
 A sister is sad 
 Lost all that she had 
 We gotta take the time 
 (Oh) 
 Look around your world 
 (It will testify) 
 Some have empty hearts 
 (Some have hungry eyes) 
 God can heal the suffering through our hands 
 Find compassion, take a stand 
 Do do do do do 
 Do do do do do 
 Do do do do do do do 
 Repeat 
 Teach the world to smile 
 (And hear angels sing) 
 Feel the breath of God 
 (And the power it brings) 
 It's time to come together, you and I 
 And share the love of Jesus Christ 
 We can make a difference 
 (Shine oh) 
 Make a change 
 (Come on now, shine on through it) 
 We can make a difference, difference, difference

 We can make a change 
 We can make a difference difference, difference

Sometimes you're wead and weary 
 Feels like you're heart is breaking 
 Nobody close enough to ease you mind 
 The darkness has you crawing 
 You wonder if you'll ever reach the light 
 But you've got to know 
 That the father is always there by your side 
 We will overcome heartache and sorrow 
 We will overcome all the pain in this world 
 We will rise above the cares of tomorrow 
 We all get disillusioned with all of life's confusions 
 Sometimes we simply have to walk by faith 
 The road may not be easy, byt there is hope and healing 
 Remember help is just a prayer away 
 So don't be afraid 
 He will give us all the strength that we need. 
 When we struggle through the hard times 
 There's a peace that comes from the Lord 
 Just remember He is faithful so believe and trust in Him more 
 And don't be afraid, He will give us all the strength that we need

I am weightless, the burden is gone 
 I am weightless, ooh, 
 I am weightless, your mercy has come 
 I am weightless, yeah 
 I'm walkin' on air 
 The world lifted off my shoulders 
 Without a care 
 Now, that the clouds are over 
 In this atmosphere 
 I can breath again 
 I am weightless, the burden is gone 
 I am weightless, ooh, 
 I am weightless, your mercy has come 
 I am weightless, yeah 
 My conscience burns 
 Time for a new confession 
 My heart returns 
 Let's hope I learned my lesson 
 And all concerns 
 Simply float away 
 I am weightless, the burden is gone 
 I am weightless, ooh, 
 I am weightless, your mercy has come 
 I am weightless, yeah 
 Lifted from the ashes 
 Sprinkled with Your blood 
 The sea of tears 
 My shame has made 
 I'm soaring high above 
 Yes, I am overcome by Your love

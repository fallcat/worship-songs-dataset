You've been so good to me and maybe that's why 
 I move so carelessly through the greet and goodbyes 
 I don't notice all the little things, that's why I'm scared 
 I have been noticing here and I'm needing You here 
 I've been thinking it over, I've been thinking it over, and I'd like to 
 Say... 
 When You hold me, when You hold me 
 Put Your arms around me more, put Your arms around me more 
 When You hold me, when You hold me 
 Put Your arms around me Lord, when I'm not worth waiting for 
 You're waiting for me 
 You're all I want to be, and that all I desire 
 Still I've been running free and I'm getting so tired 
 'Cause I've been chasing all the little things that take me from You 
 I've just been noticing I don't know what to do 
 And I've been thinking it over, I've been thinking it over, and I'd like to 
 Say... 
 When You hold me, when You hold me 
 Put Your arms around me more, put Your arms around me more 
 When You hold me, when You hold me 
 Put Your arms around me Lord, when I'm not worth waiting for 
 You're waiting for ... 
 When You hold me, when You hold me 
 Put Your arms around me more, put Your arms around me more 
 When You hold me, when You hold me 
 Put Your arms around me Lord, when I'm not worth waiting for 
 You're waited for... 
 You've waited for me

I've waited all this time, 
 Counted minutes as they've passed: 
 Searching for a sign, 
 Wishing for the best. 
 And just my hopes were wearing thin, 
 You turned my heart to Love again. 
 Like a miracle, out of the blue, 
 You rescued me like the angels do. 
 You shook the heavens, and cracked the sky, 
 When you walked, when you walked into my life. 
 When you appear, 
 Like sight to the blind, 
 Like music to my ears, 
 Like reason to arrive. 
 And just when I thought my chance was gone, 
 Love came to me, with open arms. 
 Like a miracle, out of the blue, 
 You rescued me like the angels do. 
 You shook the heavens and cracked the sky, 
 When you walked, when you walked into my life. 
 You spoke my name, 
 And the world begun again. 
 You touched my heart, 
 And it opened. 
 Like a miracle, out of the blue, 
 You rescued me like the angels do. 
 You shook the heavens and cracked the sky, 
 When you walked, when you walked into my life. 
 You rescued me 
 You shook the heavens and cracked the sky, 
 (When you walked) into my life.

Sometimes I'm sadden by the choices I make 
 So many tears I have cried 
 Got what I wanted but the dream seemed to fade 
 Still feeling unsatisfied 
 But you saved me 
 Forgave me, how you've shown 
 You'd never leave me all alone 
 Oh, Lord 
 Everytime I lose my place 
 The beauty of your grace 
 Shines a light so I can see 
 Everytime I lose my way 
 You make it all okay 
 I feel your love surrounding me 
 You are here, calming my fears 
 You lead me back with your sweet song, 
 You're where I belong 
 You're always there to guide me through my mistakes, 
 You've never once, left my side 
 The way you pick me up each time my heart breaks 
 The way you always stood by 
 I'd feel you, you'd move right through my heart 
 We never really were apart 
 Oh, Lord 
 I will always put my faith in you 
 'Cause I know you understand 
 I will try my best to follow you 
 'Cause I know you've got a plan 
 Just to have you in my life 
 Is far more than enough 
 You are everywhere around me now 
 I can feel your precious love 
 All the wonders of your ways 
 I'm constantly amazed 
 How you make me safe and sound 
 It's the way you lift me up 
 You've given me so much 
 Only you would never let me down 
 You are here, calming my fears 
 You lead me back with your sweet song, 
 You're where I belong.

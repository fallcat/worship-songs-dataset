Where I start, you begin 
 Try to measure the depth of the sky 
 That's what this is like 
 Picture the peace of the sun and the sand 
 And that's where I am 
 Imagine how it feels to know 
 I'm never alone 
 You're every breath, every thought, every sound 
 You're the ceiling, you are the ground 
 You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams 
 You are always with me 
 I can rest in the warmth of your words 
 You are not of this earth 
 You are love, you are serenity 
 And you stay with me 
 You are always with me 
 Everywhere I am I find 
 'Cause you are inside 
 You're every breath, every thought, every sound 
 You're the ceiling, you are the ground 
 You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams 
 You are always with me 
 In the moon and in the stars 
 In the light and in the dark 
 In the water, in the dirt 
 In the mirror I see you first 
 In the rain and the wind 
 Around 
 Within 
 Where I start you begin 
 You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams 
 You're with me 
 You're every breath, every thought, every sound 
 You're the ceiling, you are the ground 
 You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams 
 You are always with me

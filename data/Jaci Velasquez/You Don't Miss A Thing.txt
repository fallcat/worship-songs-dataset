You know my motives 
 You know my heart 
 No matter what I'm doin' 
 You see my secrets 
 Right through the dark 
 Who do I think I'm foolin'? 
 You watch me runnin' 
 You let me hide 
 'Cause You know where I'm goin' to 
 Seeking me 
 Reaching me 
 Keeping me in Your care, Lord 
 I can't escape it 
 1st Chorus: 
 You don't miss a thing I do 
 You see every move I make 
 But You know everything I need 
 You don't let a care get by You 
 You don't miss a thing, do You? 
 When my heart's broken 
 You dry my tears 
 'Cause You know what I'm feeling 
 When I am frozen 
 You melt my fears 
 Your gentle love is healing 
 You feed my hunger 
 You quench my thirst 
 'Cause You are my provider 
 Leading me 
 Teaching me 
 Keeping me in Your care, Lord 
 I can't escape it 
 2nd Chorus: 
 You don't miss a thing I do 
 You see every move I make 
 You know everything I need 
 You don't let a care get by You 
 You hear every word I say 
 I will never go unnoticed 
 'Cause You don't miss a thing, do You? 
 (Repeat) 
 You don't miss a thing... no, no, no...

A new day was beginning 
 And all the birds were singing 
 The sun was shining up in the sky 
 Sometimes the world around me 
 Is so awesome it astounds me 
 It leaves me feeling mystified 
 Oh I just can't believe 
 All the beauty I see 
 It takes my breath away 
 Sometimes I've gotta say 
 You're my God 
 What You've created 
 So many miracles in every day 
 You're my God 
 It's so amazing 
 It's so incredible I've gotta say 
 You're my God 
 I can't even imagine 
 How He made it happen 
 To see the silver moon from afar 
 It's almost unbelievable 
 It's truly inconceivable 
 To think of all the billions of stars 
 When I'm watching a rose 
 How it naturally grows 
 Just takes my breath away 
 There's just one thing to say 
 Oh all the gifts You've given me 
 Oh what You do's a mystery, just to be, 
 You got me falling to my knees 
 Oh I just can't believe

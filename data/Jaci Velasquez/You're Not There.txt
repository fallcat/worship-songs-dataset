Why do I think of you 
 Far beyond my reach 
 Why can't I comprehend 
 The love you have for me 
 God of all the universe 
 Of earth and sky and sea 
 Your desire to own my heart 
 Is such a mystery 
 You're not there 
 Way out there 
 Wandering in your great unknown 
 You are here ever near 
 In my heart you've found a home 
 You are living 
 You are breathing 
 I can feel your presence in me 
 All the prayers to the saints 
 Every votive burned 
 But now I know from within 
 Your loving voice is heard 
 You sent your spirit 
 The promised one 
 To be with me forever 
 You are living 
 You are breathing 
 You are loving 
 I am needing

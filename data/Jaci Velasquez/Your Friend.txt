If the wind will blow 
 I will hold you hand 
 When the sun won't shine, 
 I will never fade away 
 When the tears appear 
 To wipe away you smile 
 Don't be afraid, I'll be here 
 I will be your friend, who will always care 
 I'll be the first to catch you if ever you should fall 
 And hold you in my arms. 
 I will be your friend 
 If you lose your place 
 In life's crazy race 
 You can make it through 
 'Cause I will run with you 
 We'll always pray and 
 Believe in our hearts 
 That God will be here by our side 
 God knows our imperfections 
 And he loves us anyway 
 A closer friend than I could ever be 
 But a little piece of heaven 
 I will do my best to bring 
 You'll never have to search again 
 I will be your friend, one who always cares 
 I'll be a little closer when you feel so far away 
 And hold you in my arms 
 I will be your friend

With this breath I take 
 I turn my eyes to see Your face 
 'Cause nothing else will do 
 All I want is You 
 Unashamed I com 
 Into Your presence my heart runs 
 In Spirit and in truth 
 In will worship You 
 Jesus, Savior 
 King forever 
 Hero of my heart 
 (There's none like You 
 There's no other) 
 How I love you 
 Hear me calling out 
 All I want is You 
 In the here and now 
 Hold me closer still somehow 
 And never let me go 
 All I want is You

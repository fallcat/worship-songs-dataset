I was so afraid, I was so alone 
 Covered up in shame didn't know which way to go 
 Like a child in the night I cried out for you 
 You came running to my side like only you could do,... 
 You Amaze me how you changed me 
 From the inside out when you stepped in 
 And you saved me when you gave me 
 A hope that's new each day I live 
 You Amaze me yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Now I can't go back to where I was before 
 And I won't forget how my hearts been restored 
 By your touch, by your grace, the price you had to pay 
 So that I can get lost in your embrace 
 And let it be known that I've been forgiven much 
 I won't be slow to tell the world of all you've done 
 You Amaze me how you changed me 
 From the inside out when you stepped in 
 And you saved me when you gave me 
 A hope that's new each day I live 
 You Amaze me yeah, yeah, yeah

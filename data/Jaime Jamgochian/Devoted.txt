When I think of You 
 I remember there's a love that's strong enough 
 Love that died for all 
 Oh, the beauty of Your sacrifice 
 You gave Your life 
 And it draws me here to You 
 Oh, Lamb of God 
 It moves my heart to worship at Your feet 
 King of Majesty 
 To know You're here brings me to my knees 
 And forever I will be 
 Devoted, Devoted 
 As I look at You 
 I see everything my heart cries out to be 
 You're the Holy one 
 What a Savior what a friend to me 
 My everything 
 You fill my heart with praise 
 My heart, my love, my all 
 My life is Yours, I am devoted

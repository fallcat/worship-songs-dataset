Here I am once again broken on my knees 
 And the only thing I ask, use me as You please 
 Take my heart, take my voice, take every part of me 
 Life it up above the noise 
 I sing for You, I sing for You 
 I sing for You my king 
 I sing for You, only You when no one's listening 
 I sing for You 
 I have tried to so hard to please every heart but Yours 
 I have fallen that place I first beheld Your face 
 But Your love and Your grace is calling me back 
 To the place I'm meant to be 
 I live for You, I live for you 
 I live for You my king 
 I live for You, and only you, all my life and offering 
 I live for You 
 The only thing that really matters now 
 Is giving every breath for Your renown 
 It's all for You, everything I do for You 
 It's all for You Jesus, Whatever I go through

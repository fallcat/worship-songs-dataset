There is a time in live, there is a time to die 
 There is a time to laugh, there is a time to cry 
 There is a dance, a time for joys and praise 
 In all seasons God we humbly seek Your face 
 This is our offering 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am is for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your Glory 
 Everything I am is for You alone 
 There is a to sow, there is a time to reap 
 A time for victory, a time to claim defeat 
 A time to be renewed, a time to be reborn 
 In all seasons God we bow before Your thrones 
 This is our offering to You 
 This is our offering 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am is for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your Glory 
 Everything I am is for You alone 
 The Earth stands still without You 
 We could only move because you made us 
 The world is nothing without You 
 We can only live because You made us to 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am is for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your Glory 
 Everything I am is for You alone

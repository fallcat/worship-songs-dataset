Can words explain how I adore You 
 Can colors paint beauty like You 
 Creation testifies 
 Of Your wonder and Your might 
 How good, how great, how wonderful You are 
 All the earth stands amazed at Your fame 
 Every heart born to worship Your name 
 Angels dance and the ocean will sing 
 For our glorious King 
 Before Your throne I cry Holy 
 For You alone are my glory 
 I'm falling at Your feet 
 In awe of Majesty 
 And worship like the tide is rushing in 
 Unchanging, unfailing 
 Your love has captured me 
 My Father, my Savior 
 Glorious King

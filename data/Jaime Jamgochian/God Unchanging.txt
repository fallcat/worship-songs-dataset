You have shown time and again 
 You're forgiveness knows no end 
 Your unfailing love from generation to generation 
 You are faithful Lord to save 
 And Your mercy will not fade 
 You are glorious to generation to generation 
 God unchanging 
 Life unfading 
 Grace unending 
 There is none like You (2X) 
 None compares with You... God 
 Now we give our praise to You 
 Holy hands are lifted, too 
 Join the song that echoes from the heavens 
 Through the ages 
 Voices raised to shout Your name 
 Yesterday, today, the same 
 All the saints proclaiming 
 Your salvation to every nation 
 God unchanging 
 Life unfading 
 Grace unending 
 There is none like You 
 (2X) 
 None compares with You... God 
 We are desperate God 
 For your glory 
 We are changed O God 
 In your presence 
 God unchanging 
 Life unfading 
 Grace unending 
 There is none like you 
 (3X) 
 None compares with You... God

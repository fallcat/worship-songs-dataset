I used to wish that I could rewrite history 
 I used to dream that each mistake could be erased 
 Then I could just pretend I never knew the me back then 
 I used to pray that You would take this shame away 
 Hide all the evidence of who I've been 
 But it's a memory of the place You brought me from 
 That keeps me on my knees... and even though I'm free 
 Heal the wound but leave the scar 
 A reminder of how merciful You are 
 I am broken, torn apart 
 Take the pieces of this heart and 
 Heal the wound but leave the scar 
 I have not lived that boasts of anything 
 And I don't take pride in what I bring 
 But I'll build an alter with the rubble that You found me in 
 And every stone will sing of what You can redeem 
 Heal the wound but leave the scar 
 A reminder of how merciful You are 
 I am broken, torn apart 
 Take the pieces of this heart and 
 Heal the wound but leave the scar 
 Don't let me forget everything You've done for me 
 Don't let me forget the beauty in the suffering 
 Heal the wound but leave the scar 
 A reminder of how merciful You are 
 I am broken, torn apart 
 Take the pieces of this heart and 
 Heal the wound but leave the scar

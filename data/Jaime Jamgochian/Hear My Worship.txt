Here, as I worship You 
 I long to be more honest 
 Long to be more free 
 I, long to be more real 
 Long to be transparent 
 As you see my true intentions 
 Beyond this bended Knee 
 Beyond the words I speak 
 Beyond the songs I sing 
 Hear My Worship 
 All that my heart can bring 
 This is my offering 
 Jesus my Holy King 
 Hear my worship 
 Hear my worship 
 I long to have more faith 
 I long to be more faithful 
 Here before Your throne 
 I wait to see Your face 
 Awaiting in your presence 
 Waiting just for you to hear me

I've come to seek Your face 
 I want to know Your ways 
 I'll throw my cares to the wind 
 I want to trade my doubts 
 Oh, would You show me how 
 To find Your heart again 
 Will You reveal Your power 
 Send down Your Holy fire 
 Till only You remain 
 And let Your kingdom come 
 Oh, may Your will be done 
 Till I am forever changed 
 You're the heart of heaven 
 You're the lover of my soul 
 You are high and exalted 
 And I worship You alone 
 For You are Holy, You are worthy 
 You deserve the highest praise 
 My King of Glory, how I love You 
 Hallowed be thy Holy Name 
 You make me overflow 
 I want the world to know 
 It's You, it's You alone 
 And it's the words You say 
 They take my breath away 
 This love I've never known 
 I'm amazed, so amazed 
 Haven't felt like this 
 For a long, long time

You are beautiful beyond description 
 Too marvelous for words 
 Too wonderful for comprehension 
 Like nothing ever seen or heard 
 And who can grasp Your infinite wisdom 
 And who can fathom the depths of Your love 
 You are beautiful beyond description 
 Majesty enthroned above 
 And I stand, I stand in awe of You 
 And I stand, I stand in awe of You 
 Holy God to whom all praise is due 
 I stand in awe of You 
 You are beautiful beyond description 
 Yet God crushed You for my sin 
 In Agony and deep affliction 
 Cut off that I may enter in 
 Who can grasp such tender compassion 
 Who can fathom this mercy so free 
 You are beautiful beyond description 
 Lamb of God who died for me 
 And I stand, I stand in awe of You 
 And I stand, I stand in awe of You 
 Holy God to whom all praise is due 
 I stand in awe of You

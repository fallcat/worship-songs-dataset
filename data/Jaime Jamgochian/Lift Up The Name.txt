Who gave His life so that we 
 Could be one with the Father 
 Hallelujah 
 All those who thirst come and 
 Drink from the well of living water 
 Hallelujah 
 Majesty displayed throughout creation 
 May the sound echo through the nations 
 Every heart that's in this place 
 Lift up the name 
 Above all names 
 Every voice together raised 
 To give Him praise 
 Lift up the name 
 Who offers strength for the weak 
 And gives us hope to the broken 
 Hallelujah 
 Who is the King of all Kings 
 Prince of peace 
 Our devotion 
 Hallelujah 
 The name of Jesus 
 The name of Jesus 
 He is Holy 
 He is Worthy

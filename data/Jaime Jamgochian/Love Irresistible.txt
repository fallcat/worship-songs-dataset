I've been high, I've been low 
 Heard a million songs on the radio 
 And it's all just left me wanting more you You 
 I got up, I broke down 
 Seems I would have learned this lesson by now 
 That it all just leaves me wanting more of You 
 All around, everywhere, I feel You near me 
 The scent of Your presence is undeniable 
 Hold me tight day and night I see it clearly 
 I can't get enough of You, Love Irresistible 
 I've had fun, I've had pain 
 Done somethings I don't want to do again 
 And it all just leaves me wanting more of You 
 I was blind, now I see 
 Your beautiful world is surrounding me 
 And it all just leaves me wanting more of You 
 Love that draws me near to You 
 I can't turn away from You 
 No one's love compares to You 
 Its true

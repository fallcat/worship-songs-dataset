High as the sky 
 Deep as the sea 
 Your love keeps pouring down on me 
 Bright as the sun 
 Fresh as the dawn 
 Your mercy carries on 
 As far as the East from the West 
 So far have You taken our sins from us 
 And we Praise Your name, Jesus 
 Everything is changed 
 Everything is new 
 Love rains down because of You 
 (Love rains down, love rains down) 
 Comes like a flood 
 Into my soul 
 Drowns me but it makes me whole 
 Sweep me away 
 Into Your heart 
 You are faithful, God 
 As far as the East from the West 
 So far have You taken our sins from us 
 And we Praise Your name, Jesus 
 Everything is changed 
 Everything is new 
 Love rains down because of You 
 (Love rains down, love rains down) 
 The old is gone the new has come 
 Love rains down, love rains down 
 In this world in his heart 
 Love rains down, love rains down 
 As far as the East from the West 
 So far have You taken our sins from us 
 And we Praise Your name, Jesus 
 Everything is changed 
 Everything is new 
 Love rains down because of You 
 (East from the West) 
 So far have You taken our sins from us 
 And we Praise Your name, Jesus 
 Everything is changed 
 Everything is new 
 Love rains down because of You 
 Everything is changed 
 Everything is new 
 Love rains down because of You 
 Love rains down, love rains down, love rains down, love rains down, love rains down, love rains down, love rains down

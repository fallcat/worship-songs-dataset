Only this I ask of the Lord 
 This I seek to know You more 
 To gaze upon the beauty of our God 
 Lord of Light who we adore 
 You are my refuge 
 I will always run to You 
 In all that I do, I want to Glorify, to lift on high 
 My King, My God 
 Let every part of me exalt Your name, I will proclaim 
 My King, My God 
 Brighter than the stars you light the world 
 With who You are for all to see 
 So let us dwell with You for all our days 
 Before Your perfect majesty 
 Great are Your promises 
 So I give my heart to you 
 Great are You oh, God 
 You're my King, You're my God 
 Let everything I do 
 Let everything I am 
 Let every part of me 
 Exalt Your Holy name 
 My King, My God

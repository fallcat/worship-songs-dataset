If I rise on wings of the dawn 
 I would find You there 
 If I reside in the depths of the sea, You're there 
 It's a mystery how Your love keeps pouring down on me 
 You set me Free 
 You, You give me reason to live 
 All of my heart I will give 
 There is no other that compares anywhere 
 To You, You're all I want, nothing less 
 More than these words can express 
 Moment by moment, day by day 
 I lift my praise to You 
 You opened up my heart 
 To see You're everywhere 
 And treasure every thought 
 Over me You're near 
 Were I too count them all 
 They'd out number the grains of the sand 
 I lift my hands 
 Hallelujah 
 I worship and adore You 
 We bow before You, Lord 
 We lift Your name on high 
 You are worthy, You are holy 
 Yes You are, Jesus

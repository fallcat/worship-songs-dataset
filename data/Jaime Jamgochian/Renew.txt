Our Father, maker of the Heavens and the Earth 
 Author of the universe who imagined us 
 God all seeing into our humanity 
 Come let Your kingdom be with us 
 Oh, let Your will be done 
 Lord Jesus, Son of God, who sits at His right hand 
 Perfect love that became man 
 Sacrificed for us 
 Pure redeemer, into our iniquity come 
 Let forgiveness sweetly fall, have mercy on us all 
 Renew Your people, renew Your promise 
 Renew our hearts for You 
 Renew Your people, renew Your promise 
 Renew our hearts for You, Lord renew 
 Holy Spirit, gift of risen hope, abiding peace 
 Comforter who intercedes, carries every prayer 
 Moving presences, Living breath of living God 
 Come stir the passion in our hearts 
 Breathe new life into us

Take us, Lord and fill our hearts with wonder 
 Want to see Your Majesty and splendor 
 Your mercy reaches our to us 
 The Son of God has raised us to new life 
 New life 
 So we sing of our God and how wonderful 
 Is His love on the earth and miraculous 
 Is the mercy that came and has conquered death 
 So we sing of our God, we sing of our God 
 Take us Lord and change us in Your wisdom 
 So we can shine Your light unto the kingdom 
 You have more than we could ever comprehend 
 Compassion without end 
 No end 
 You are wonderful 
 So let us join the angels singing 
 Holy is the Lamb of God 
 You are wonderful 
 So let us join the angels singing 
 Worthy is the lamb of God

More than words on my lips 
 Melodies I sing like this, my worship is the life I live 
 Songs grow old and music fades, it's not about that anyway 
 My worship is the life I live 
 You have my heart and I surrender every part of me 
 Forever more I'm Yours 
 My worship is the life I live 
 In the joy through the pain 
 Times of thirst or days of rain, my worship is the life I live 
 Holy God, one so real, despite the cost or how I feel 
 My worship is the life I live 
 You have my heart and I surrender every part of me 
 Forever more I'm Yours 
 My worship is the life I live 
 My worship, my worship, is the life I live 
 My worship, my worship, is the life I live 
 Let everything I do bring glory and honor to You 
 Let everything I am bring glory and honor to You 
 I long to worship You in spirit and truth all of my days oh God 
 You are my God

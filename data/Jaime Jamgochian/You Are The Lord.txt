You are the sun that floods the dark with light 
 You are the star that calms the fearful night 
 You are the Word that brings us all to life 
 You are the Lord 
 You are the wind that sings in quiet praise 
 You are the fire that sets our hearts ablaze 
 Living water washing us with grace 
 You are the Lord 
 You are the Lord 
 You are the, our God 
 We adore 
 You are the Lord 
 You are the mountain that cannot be moved 
 The fountain where our weary souls are soothed 
 The Eden where we are renewed 
 You are the Lord 
 Everything Miraculous 
 Everything mysterious 
 Everything that's glorious, You are 
 Oh hand that mends the things we've torn 
 Faithful love that reaches and restores 
 The only hope worth living for 
 You are the Lord

I will awaken the dawn with a new song 
 A hymn of praise forever rising up to You 
 And I will shout out the name that shattered my shame 
 Bore my sin forever is making all things new 
 You are the story 
 You are the story 
 You will restore this world back to You 
 A nation on fire 
 With one desire 
 To bring You honor that's worthy and true 
 Worthy and true 
 Now I'm praying that my heart would be steadfast 
 My thoughts wound forever be fixed upon Your word 
 For there is nothing that can separate us from the love of Jesus 
 Your faithfulness endures 
 You are the story 
 You are the story 
 You will restore this world back to You 
 A nation on fire 
 With one desire 
 To bring You honor that's worthy and true 
 Worthy and true 
 From the beginning 
 Throughout the ages 
 You are the author of all there's pages 
 Every chapter every mile 
 All of our histories every trial 
 Frio the greatest of Kings to the smallest child 
 You are the story 
 You are the story 
 You will restore this world back to You 
 A nation on fire 
 With one desire 
 To bring You honor that's worthy and true 
 Worthy and true

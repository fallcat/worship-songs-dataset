More than I ever imagined 
 Deep within my heart lies passion 
 For who You are 
 The one who spun the stars so lovely 
 Set the universe above me 
 Yeah, that's who You are 
 I want to see Your glory appear 
 I want to feel Your presence drawing near 
 God of Hope extraordinary 
 Matchless love there's no comparing 
 Abba Father always caring, You are 
 (You are the) Peace that passes understanding 
 Peace that grows always expanding 
 God of hope extraordinary, You are 
 You Are 
 In your hands my life a treasure 
 Yesterday, today, forevermore 
 That's who You are 
 When I stop to think of all Your wonder 
 Your mysteries I soon discover there is more 
 Of who You are 
 Rise up and stand let God's face shine on you again 
 Just take a chance you're covered by 
 The shadow of His hands

You did it all for me 
 And I am thankful 
 You gave up everything 
 And I'm grateful 
 You took my sin, my shame, my place 
 Touched my heart and I am changed 
 You, You're everything worth living for 
 You, it is my prayer to know You more 
 As I worship, I worship 
 You 
 My heart bows to Your name 
 You are Holy 
 I lift my song in praise 
 You are worthy 
 No greater love has been displayed 
 Than Yours upon the cross that day 
 You, You're everything worth living for 
 You, it is my prayer to know You more 
 As I worship, I worship 
 You

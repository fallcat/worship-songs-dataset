I will not fear as I wait for the dawn 
 If you'll keep on holding my hand 
 Though I'm crying out from the depths of my soul 
 With words I just can't understand 
 You have set my feet upon a rock that's not moving 
 You have placed a song of hope in my heart and 
 I'm singing, I'm praying 
 Lord, do not hold back your loving kindness 
 Lord, do not hold back your mercy 
 You are the way and the truth that guides us 
 Everyday you are the one who preserves me 
 God the great artist designed you and me 
 With His will and purpose in mind 
 But I keep on striving and trying to be 
 Someone I've made with my pride 
 Now the fires of hell burn hot and try to destroy me 
 But I run to your will Oh God 
 I know you'll restore me, and reform me

She wakes up before me and never looks back 
 She lights up the morning ahead of the sun 
 Her eyes bright and gentle they tell of her soul 
 An ocean of kindness too great to control 
 Who can find another like you 
 Who can love the way that you do 
 Who can find someone as true 
 The Beautiful 
 Her hands like a servant 
 Her heart like a queen 
 Her arms gently whisper to all the unseen 
 A gift sent from heaven 
 My pearl of great price 
 Oh what a fortaste of glory divine 
 Beautiful

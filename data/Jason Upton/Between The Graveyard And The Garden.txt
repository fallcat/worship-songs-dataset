There are days and there are nights 
 That keep me hanging on 
 There are moments and there are times 
 Moonlight guides me home 
 I don't know where I'm going 
 I've been blinded by the truth 
 Between the graveyard and the garden 
 There's a road that leads to you 
 There's a road that leads to you 
 I'm ahead of my time 
 I'm one of a kind 
 I am all alone 
 I'm a serial thriller 
 I'm a boredom killer 
 I want to pick my own gravestone 
 I don't know where I'm going 
 I've been blinded by the truth 
 Between the graveyard and the garden 
 There's a road that leads to you 
 There's a road that leads to you

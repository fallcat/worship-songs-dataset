I've been blinded, by the truth 
 I know not where I'm goin' 
 I know not where I'm goin'. 
 I've been blinded by the truth 
 Guess I'm gonna trust you 
 I've been blinded, I don't know when 
 I only know, you're my only friend 
 I'm gonna follow, 'cause what else can I do 
 Jesus, mmmmmm 
 Sometimes there are no words 
 Sometimes there are no words 
 Sometimes there are no words, 
 To the deepest song 
 Sometimes there are no ways 
 To say what we need to say, mmmmm 
 There are roads 
 In the deepest part 
 You can hear my groan 
 If you can hear my heart 
 So I guess its just you and me Jesus 
 It's all the same 
 Given up this memory of religion to follow you 
 'Cause I've been blinded by the truth 
 Hold my hand Jesus I'm gonna follow you 
 I've been blinded mmmmmmmm 
 I don't know, Where I am going 
 More and more each day its becoming just all right with me 
 'Cause when I know, where I'm going 
 My eyes keep me from trusting thee 
 I wanna trust you 
 'Cause it's the purest worship 
 I wanna trust you 
 Not just with words 
 I wanna trust you 
 'Cause you deserve it 
 Ooh 
 Take my vision, take my vision, 
 I wanna see, I wanna really see 
 I wanna see your kingdom 
 Your kingdom comin' 
 Let the world wound me 
 Until I see you alone in everything 
 Let it wound me, let it wound me 
 Until I see you alone in everything 
 Let it wound me, Let it wound me 
 With the reality of it's insufficiency 
 Let it wound me, Let it wound me 
 Until I see you alone in everything

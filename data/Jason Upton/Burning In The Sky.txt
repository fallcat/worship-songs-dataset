You've been too long upon this mountain 
 Its time you journey to the sea 
 Sometimes to trust in your false comfort 
 Is easier than trusting me 
 Some men only believe in as much as their eyes can see 
 Some men only believe in as much as their minds conceive 
 But believing's like conceiving 
 This child that we're receiving 
 A gift beyond our reason 
 Its more of what we need, and less of what we know 
 It calls not to our mind, but cries out to our soul 
 That mountain's burning in the sky 
 To the heart of heaven 
 Without the fire we'll never fly 
 To the heart of heaven 
 Can you hear God's holy cry 
 From the heart of heaven 
 Lay it all down 
 Lay it all down 
 Lay it all down 
 For the heart of heaven

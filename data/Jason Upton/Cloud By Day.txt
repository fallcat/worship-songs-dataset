I know you walk on the water 
 I know you ride on the wind 
 I know you clothe yourself with light 
 So why do I find it so hard to comprehend 
 Directions to the other side 
 A cloud by day a fire by night 
 I'll keep moving on 
 It may seem strange but I know it's right 
 I'll keep moving on 
 I've got my friends here to help me 
 I've got my wife here to hold me 
 I've got my children by my side 
 Although they do make me happy 
 I know they're to make me holy 
 Each day they raise the cup of Christ 
 A cloud by day a fire by night 
 I'll keep moving on 
 It may seem strange but I know it's right 
 I'll keep moving on

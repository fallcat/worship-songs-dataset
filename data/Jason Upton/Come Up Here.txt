I was dreaming of the holy city 
 I was wearing my wings 
 Then I looked up and saw a doorway to heaven 
 And I heard you calling me 
 Come up here, come up now 
 My beloved, my beloved 
 Come up here, come up now 
 My beloved, my beloved, come 
 I want to fly 
 Like an eagle in the sky 
 I want to fly 
 Through that doorway in the sky 
 And Come

You've got your best man on the front side 
 You always show your best side 
 And evil's always on the other side 
 You say this is your strategy 
 But son I hope you take it from me 
 You look just like your enemy 
 You're full of pride 
 We better trash our idols if we want to be 
 In the army of the Lord 
 And the greatest idol is you and me, 
 We better get on the threshing floor 
 When will we learn that God's strategy 
 Is giving glory to the Lord? 
 We better trash our idols if we want to be 
 In the army of the Lord 
 Star how beautiful you shine 
 You shine more beautiful than mine 
 You shine from sea to shining sea 
 World-wide is your strategy 
 But shinning star I hope you see 
 If the whole wide world is staring straight at you 
 They can't see me...

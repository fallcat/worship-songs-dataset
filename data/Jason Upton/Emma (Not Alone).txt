Don't be afraid baby don't you cry 
 Daddy's here it will be all right 
 You're not alone you're not alone 
 Don't be afraid when you're cold at night 
 I will keep you warm I will hold you tight 
 You're not alone you're not alone 
 Look beyond the window there 
 To the sky above to the open air 
 Look beyond what you can see 
 Close your eyes and just believe 
 The lion roars and the lamb lays down 
 They live together in a whole new town 
 They're calling me and they're calling you 
 From the cold hard facts that we're on our own 
 To the age old truth that we're not alone 
 Don't be afraid when you scrape your knee 
 I've got a band aide waiting and a kiss for free 
 You're not alone you're not alone 
 Don't be afraid of your blind belief 
 Because the more you fly the more you'll see 
 You're not alone you're not alone 
 Look beyond the window there 
 To the sky above to the open air 
 Look beyond what you can see 
 Close your eyes and just believe 
 The lion roars and the lamb lays down 
 They live together in a whole new town 
 They're calling me and they're calling you 
 From the cold hard facts that we're on our own 
 To the age old truth that we're not alone 
 Don't be afraid little warrior bride 
 Your victory's on the other side 
 You're not alone you're not alone

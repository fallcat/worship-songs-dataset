I can remember when I was afraid like you 
 Not so long ago 
 Confusion ruled my life wondering what to do 
 Not so long ago 
 These are resting waves from a memory 
 In a hiding place in my mind 
 But the sweetest taste is a history 
 When suffering wears the face of time 
 The pain hurt way too much the water was so cold 
 Not so long ago 
 That's when light rescued me from darkness I was free 
 Not so long ago 
 In the place of suffering 
 There's a God worth worshipping 
 On these wings of worship we will ride

Let faith arise, oh Lord, let faith arise 
 In the deepest parts of my being, oh Lord 
 In the most broken parts of me, oh Lord 
 Friends have failed me Lord, let my faith arise 
 Loved ones have failed me Lord, let my faith arise 
 Heroes have failed me Lord, let my faith arise 
 Let my faith arise 
 Let my faith arise 
 Let my faith arise 
 Let my faith arise 
 I say NO to the discouragement that keeps me down 
 I say NO to the things that keep me back from You 
 And this broken heart inside of me 
 Broken in so many pieces 
 By so many circumstances 
 I say NO to just letting it stay that way 
 Because I'm learning to trust that it's not You that hurt me 
 I'm learning to believe that it's not You that deserted me 
 I'm believing that You still love me 
 Brokenness and all 
 I'm believing that You've got a plan for me 
 I'm believing that You will restore me 
 I believe that You will awaken my soul 
 And let, let faith arise again, I believe 
 I believe like a little child again 
 I'm gonna dance in my trust in You, oh Lord 
 I'm gonna dance in my love for You, oh Lord 
 I'm gonna laugh again 
 I'm gonna cry again 
 I'm gonna have joy, joy on the inside 
 Circumstances around me try to pull me down 
 I'm going to believe in that faith again 
 'Cause You're my Creator 
 You're my Comfort 
 You're the One that will never desert me 
 So Daddy, I raise my hands up to You Lord 
 I raise my hands up to You, oh Lord 
 And I dance with my feet, I dance with my feet 
 And I say, come and, come and hold me Lord 
 'Cause I'm learning to trust You with the faith of a child 
 Trust You with the faith of a child 
 I can have joy again like a child 
 I'm not going to let it come down 
 I'm not going to let those bullets come down 
 Come down and hurt me no more 
 'Cause I'm raising up the Shield of Faith 
 And the Sword of the Lord 
 I'm believing on your Word Lord 
 I'm trusting in the Word that You said 
 And I'm waiting on You 
 Waiting on You 
 And I'm rejoicing in the fact that the Bible says 
 That You are my Victorious Warrior 
 You're the one that fights for me 
 I don't have to fight anymore 
 You're the one that fights for me, oh Lord 
 My faith is rising, my faith is rising, my faith is rising 
 I can see You again Lord. 
 I can see You on the horizon of my life, oh Lord 
 I can see Your Son, it's rising up, it's rising up, it's rising up 
 And I don't have to be discouraged anymore 
 And I don't have to fight this loneliness anymore 
 'Cause You're in my life, You're in my life more than anyone can ever be 
 Father we're building a relationship again, just me and You 
 We're building a relationship again, just me and You 
 It's not about the job I have 
 It's not about the friends I have 
 It's not about the house I have or the social status I have 
 It's about me and You 
 We're building a relationship again, just me and You 
 You're building my faith up again 
 Let faith arise, oh Lord!

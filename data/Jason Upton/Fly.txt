 Going up to new places 
 Going up to new atmospheres

 New revelation (Repeat 2) 
 What are you doing 
 Where are you going 
 You're gonna give 
 Some of you've been fighting for a very long time 
 Some of you've been fighting that ground warfare for a very long time 
 Sticking out your fists and fighting 
 God wants to take us to new places (repeat 6) 
 New revelation (2)

 Ariel View (4) 
 I declare over you 
 God has given you the air 
 God has given you the air so fly 
 It's time to spread out your wings 
 It's time to shake off the things that hold you down 
 It's time to spread out your wings and fly 
 Just fly... fly (hold) 
 Do you see what I see 
 Do you hear what I hear 
 Do you know what I know 
 Do you want what I want 
 Fly... fly... fly... 
 Do you see what I see 
 Do you hear what I hear 
 Do you know what I know 
 Fly (Repeat 7) 
 Just fly (Repeat 2) 
 Fly (hold) 
 I have given you wings 
 I have set you free from the things that held you 
 I have given you wings 
 I have set you free so come to me 
 Fly (hold) 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 Like a bird in the air you have escaped the snare 
 Like a bird in the air you've escaped the snare of the enemy 
 You have been set free (Repeat 4) 
 Nothing can ever hold you 
 Fly...

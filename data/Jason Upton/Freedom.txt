Freedom! 
 Back in the bible there was that old Pharaoh 
 Who ruled over Egypt and Israel 
 God spoke to Moses through fired up bushes 
 Said kick off your shoes and stay awhile 
 All of humanity was made to worship me 
 Pharaoh get outta my way 
 (God is sayin') 
 Freedom to dance 
 Freedom to sing 
 Freedom to grow 
 I'm telling you Pharaoh let God's people go! 
 Worship now 
 Worship now 
 Worship your God 
 (Let 'em go) 
 Well, we live in a country supposedly Pharaohless 
 But all over town and in churches abide 
 Powerful weaklings who practice they're politics 
 Stealing from Jesus his beautiful bride 
 Whether you're Pharisees, Sadducees, heresies 
 You best get outta God's way! 
 (God is sayin') 
 Freedom to dance 
 Freedom to sing 
 Freedom to grow 
 We're telling you Pharaoh let God's people go!

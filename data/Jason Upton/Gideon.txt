I don't have the power 
 I don't even have a clue 
 I don't know all the answers 
 I don't even know a few 
 But if I were really honest 
 And the truth were known of me 
 It might sound a little funny 
 But this is what my prayer would be 
 I don't know what to do 
 But my eyes are on You 
 I don't know what to do 
 But my eyes are on You 
 I lift my eyes toward the Heavens 
 Tune my ear to Your command 
 Help me boast in my condition

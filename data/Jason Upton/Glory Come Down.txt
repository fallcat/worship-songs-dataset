Father, listen to our earnest prayer 
 Jesus prayed it years ago 
 That the glory You had given Him 
 We would somehow come to know 
 So make us one according to Your plan 
 As in heaven it will be 
 Fill us with the truth and righteousness 
 You desire the world to see 
 Let Your glory and honor 
 Fall on our face 
 Holy Father 
 Rest in this place 
 The church is sick and need of God alone 
 And, people, we must seek His face 
 If we turn from our unrighteousness 
 He'll forgive our evil ways 
 So may the eyes of God be on us here 
 Lord, revive us by Your grace 
 Holy Spirit be forever near 
 Saturate us in this place 
 Let Your glory and honor 
 Fall on our face 
 Holy Father 
 Rest in this place 
 Let the fire fall 
 Let the wind blow 
 Let the glory come down

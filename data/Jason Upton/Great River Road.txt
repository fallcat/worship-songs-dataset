I was born where the rivers run 
 Native blood runs through my veins 
 I was born where the eagles come 
 Waiting till the winter fades 
 I was born an endangered son 
 I was spared by a mother's dream 
 I was saved by the power of love 
 I was snatched from the fire of greed 
 Great river road where justice rolled 
 Let it roll, let it roll down 
 Great river road where healing flowed 
 Let it flow, let it flow now 
 I was born to an orphaned son 
 I was seed from a broken life 
 I was just like the other ones 
 Waiting on the other side 
 I was born because freedom won 
 Mother sent me down the stream 
 I was saved by the power of love 
 I was snatched from the fire of greed

For a child is born to us 
 Light of God upon her face 
 Filled with favor and with love 
 She's a miracle of grace 
 She's a miracle of grace 
 I see a mother with her child 
 I see a daddy standing tall 
 I see the joy that you have brought to us all 
 I know gramps will teach you Bible 
 We'll all teach you ice cream 
 Probably you'll be teaching us all that we've lost. 
 I know there's a reason there's rhyme 
 For every season there's a sign 
 I know there's a message God has just for us 
 Cause somehow as we grow 
 We lose what we were told 
 Simple seems the cost for getting old

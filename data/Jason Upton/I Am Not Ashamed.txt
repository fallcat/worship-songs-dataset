Jesus I long to be holy 
 Jesus I long to be real 
 In a world of broken people 
 So many need to be healed 
 Purify my hands to hold them 
 Purify my heart to burn with devotion 
 For You, Lord Jesus, for You 
 I'm not ashamed of Jesus 
 My Lord my Lover my Friend 
 The power to cleanse and redeem us 
 Is in the blood of the Lamb 
 Oh how the mighty have fallen 
 Buried in their filthy rags 
 Father please turn from your anger 
 My lips will boast of your ways 
 Cause, it's all in the blood of the savior 
 It's all in the love that you have for You're son 
 And I believe, in Jesus, I believe

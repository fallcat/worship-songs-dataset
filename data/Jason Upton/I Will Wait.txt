I will wait for you, Jesus 
 You're the sun in my horizon 
 All my hope's in you, Jesus 
 And I can see you now, Arising 
 (I will wait) 
 I will wait for you, Jesus 
 You're the sun in my horizon 
 All my hope's in you (All My Hope), Jesus 
 And I can see you now, Arising 
 There's a wall that stands in front of me, 
 That I know I just can't climb 
 And Like an Eagle, you've Forgiven me, 
 It's just a matter of time 
 I will wait for you (I will wait), Jesus 
 You're the sun in my horizon, 
 All my hopes and dreams, Jesus 
 I can see you now, Arising 
 Evil armies all around me 
 Another wall that's in my way, 
 But I believe the word you promised me, 
 So I will wait another day 
 I will wait for you (I will wait), Jesus 
 You're the sun in my horizon, 
 All my hopes' in you (all my hope), Jesus 
 I can see you now, Arising 
 (I Will Wait) 
 Oh, I will wait for you (I Will wait), Jesus 
 You're the sun in my horizon, 
 All my hopes' in you, Jesus 
 I can see you now, Arising 
 I will wait for you 
 Oh, I will wait for you 
 Oh, darkness trying to come in, 
 The disillusion trying to get in 
 I believe oh lord! 
 I believe oh lord in the word that you're promising me 
 The word that you promise, 
 The word that you promise 
 I believe in that 
 I believe in that 
 I will wait for you 
 Oh, I will wait for you 
 I will wait for you, Jesus 
 You're the sun in my horizon 
 All my hope's in you, Jesus

In the beginning God 
 Saw everything when love went wandering into the night. 
 Was I first or last? 
 Was I second best? 
 These questions quickly pass into the light. 
 At the waters edge 
 I see As your spirit speaks to me: 
 Call to me and I will answer you, 
 I'll give you peace, 
 A peace you have not known on your own. 
 When my vision died 
 You opened my eyes to something that I had never seen. 
 I have touched your hands and you have called me friend, 
 But doubting never ends until I believe. 
 At the waters edge I see 
 As your spirit speaks to me: 
 Call to me and I will answer you, 
 I'll give you peace, 
 A peace you have not known on your own.

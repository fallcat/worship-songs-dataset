Tired of telling you, you have me 
 When I know you really don't 
 Tired of telling you I'll follow 
 When I know I reallly won't 
 'Cause I'd rather stand here speechless 
 With no great words to say 
 If my silence is more truthful 
 And my ears can hear how to walk in your way 
 In the silence 
 You are speaking 
 In the quiet I can feel the fire 
 And it's burning, burning deeply 
 Burning all that it is that you desire to be silent, in me 
 Oh Jesus can you hear me? 
 My soul is screaming out 
 And my broken will cries teach me 
 What your Kingdom's all about 
 Unite my heart to fear you, 
 To fear your holy name 
 Adn create a life of worship 
 In the spirit and truth of your loving ways

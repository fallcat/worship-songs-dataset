Father I am waiting 
 I need to hear from You 
 To know that You're approving 
 Of what I say and do 
 Cause nothing really satisfies 
 Like when You speak my name 
 So tell me that You'll never leave 
 And everything will be okay 
 In Your presence, all fear is gone 
 In Your presence 
 In Your presence, is where I belong 
 In Your presence 
 Father I'm returning 
 To things I used to do 
 Cause somewhere on the journey 
 I think I lost hold of the truth 
 But nothing really satisfies 
 Like when You speak my name 
 So tell me that You'll never leave 
 And everything will be okay 
 In Your presence, all fear is gone 
 In Your presence 
 In Your presence, is where I belong 
 In Your presence

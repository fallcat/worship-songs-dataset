Is there room in your womb 
 Young woman 
 Is there room in your womb 
 For a child 
 I've heard the promise He fulfilled 
 I've heard the song of the angels 
 God sending peace and good will 
 But is there room 
 For a child 
 HOw long will we push our children out 
 Is there room in our world for a new word to tell 
 A Holy child from God's right hand 
 Is a holy word from God to man 
 But is there room 
 For a child 
 Is there room in your inn 
 Young man 
 Is there room in your inn 
 For a child 
 I've heard the promises He fulfilled 
 I've heard the song of the angels 
 God sending peace and good will 
 But is there room 
 For a child 
 How long will we push our children out 
 Is there room in our world for a new word to tell 
 A Holy child from God's right hand 
 Is a holy word from God to man 
 But is there room 
 For a child

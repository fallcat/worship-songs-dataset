I am learning to be a father but I really don't know how 
 To be willing to care for others more than I love myself 
 It ain't easy learning to love like you 
 I am learning to love my neighbor and to live by the golden rule 
 But it's so hard when I've been lied to 
 I feel like a fool forgiving a fool 
 It ain't easy learning to love like you 
 I am learning to be faithful with the little that I have 
 To do like Jesus and turn the tables 
 To give it all to get nothing back 
 It ain't easy leaning to love like you

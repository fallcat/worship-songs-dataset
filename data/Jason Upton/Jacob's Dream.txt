Jacob really longed to be a hero 
 All I really wanted was a friend 
 I'm the way, the life, the truth 
 So tell Me Jacob when will the lying end? 
 And does the striving make you strong? 
 Because when I came to love on you 
 You fought me till the dawn 
 Finally Jacob's lying down 
 And while he sleeps I will dream 
 Of a generation not known for their crowns, 
 Or success, but a King... 
 Who was not so much as interested in crowds, or 
 Pleasing men, but knowing Me 
 CH: 
 I have given Jacob's generation the key of David, intimacy 
 To open up the doorway to the nations, and release 
 Revelation, of intimacy, with me 
 Jacob had a dream for all the ages 
 Jacob had a drive to build a nation 
 But the fighting is in vain 
 If your only aim is to build your own great name 
 Because My dream's not what you do 
 Jacob will you dream for me 
 The way that I have dreamed for you 
 CH: 
 I have given Jacob's generation the key of David, intimacy 
 To open up the doorway to the nations, and release 
 Revelation, of intimacy, with me

I tried to walk on the water and found myself under the sea 
 So with water up my nose I felt your hand come close to save me 
 I've tried to cast out the demons I've gone to the darkest of regions 
 When fear has me shaking you suddenly break in to save me 
 I desire 
 To be like you 
 Like any son or daughter 
 I want to be like my Father 
 I desire to be like you 
 You promised to never forsake me 
 So I'll risk it all if you'll make me like You 
 You stand beside me just waiting while I try to go it alone 
 Smiling You say son come here won't you let me just help you 
 But frustrated I try to make it 'cause I've just got something to prove 
 Not knowing it is my weakness that perfects your power

No one knows the hour 
 No one knows the day 
 Jesus is coming soon 
 All creation trembles, longing for the day 
 Jesus is coming soon 
 There will be judgment 
 There will be mercy 
 On that terrible day 
 Leaders will bow down 
 Kingdoms will fall down 
 Have you felt your world begin to shake? 
 Hear the sound of the Lion of Judah 
 See the fire and the fear in the enemy's camp 
 From the sound of the lion of Judah roaring again 
 There's a new generation arising 
 A nameless, faceless, placeless tribe 
 All they fear is the fear of the Lord 
 All they hear is the Lion of Judah 
 All I saw were bones breaking in the darkness 
 Then I walked into the light 
 There I saw an army coming from the river 
 With five stones ready to fight

Sometimes we feel so afraid 
 Sometimes we feel so lonely 
 Sometimes we feel confused 
 Sometimes we feel so helpless 
 And we don't know what to do 
 (It's) so hard to believe it 
 If we never heard it 
 Ihe voice of our father said our name 
 You're not alone 
 You're not alone 
 I'll never leave you 
 I'll never leave you (2x) 
 Oh, Lord... 
 Sometimes 
 We're sitting in the middle of the dark at night 
 Sitting on the piano playing right on 
 Sometime just sing till the seal come 
 Sing it oh... 
 I'm not alone 
 I'm not alone 
 You never leave me 
 You never leave me (4x) 
 Oh Lord... 
 Martin Luther King 
 One night was sitting at his kitchen table all by himself 
 His family had already gone to bed 
 And all of a sudden he receives this phone call 
 And this man said: 
 "Martin if you don't stop preaching what you're preaching 
 We're gonna take the life of your family and we're gonna take your life 
 We're gonna kill you." 
 And after he hung up the phone 
 He said at that table 
 And he begin just to say: 
 "Father, I grew up in the church 
 I've preached your kingdom in justice all over the earth 
 I've preached your kingdom in justice all over America 
 And I know you're real 
 But right now I'm so afraid and I don't think I've ever hurt You 
 Say my name 
 And I'm here to hear your voice father I need you to say my name" 
 And he just began to cry 
 And out the silence he heard the voice of his father for the first time 
 And it said this: 
 Never alone Martin 
 Never alone Martin 
 I'll never leave you (3x) 
 I'll never leave you 
 No...

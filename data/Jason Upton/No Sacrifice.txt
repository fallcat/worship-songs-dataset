To you I give my life, not just the parts I want to 
 To you I sacrifice these dreams that I hold on to 
 Your thoughts are higher than mine 
 Your words are deeper than mine 
 Your love is stronger than mine 
 This is no sacrifice 
 Here's my life 
 To you I give the gifts 
 Your love has given me 
 How can I hoard the treasures that you've designed for free? 
 Because 
 Your thoughts are higher than mine 
 Your words are deeper than mine 
 Your love is staronger than mine 
 This is no sacrifice 
 Here's my life 
 To you I give my future 
 As long as it may last 
 To you I give my present 
 To you I give my past 
 Because 
 Your thoughts are higher than mine 
 Your words are deeper than mine 
 Your love is stronger than mine 
 Your thoughts are higher than mine 
 Your words are deeper than mine 
 Your love is stronger than mine 
 This is no sacrifice 
 Here's my life

I want to go where the sun always shines 
 Where people are peaceful with no battle lines 
 Where children are playing in innocent ways 
 I want to go there one of these days 
 I want to go where the leaves are all turning 
 And life's only certain to be wonderful 
 Where water is plenty but skies never grey 
 I want to go there one of these days 
 Some say that I'm only dreaming 
 And that this can't be true 
 But my faith has only been increasing 
 Since the day that I met you 
 One day we're going where love never dies 
 Where no one is hungry no empty eyes 
 And joy is abundant in everyone's praise 
 We're going to go there one of these days 
 One of these days we're going to go over to Jordan 
 Where justice will roll down like water 
 One of these days we're going to go over to Jordan 
 Where justice will roll down like water

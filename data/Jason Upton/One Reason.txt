I lived my life for a while 
 Asking for signs to believe in 
 God played defense in my trial 
 Quietly hanging there bleeding 
 While I cast lots for his robe 
 While I point my bloody finger 
 He pays debts that I owe 
 He says "Father, forgive them" 
 I used to ask for a sign to believe in 
 But he never gave me a reason to ever doubt Him 
 Give me one reason to doubt He is Messiah 
 Give me one reason to doubt He is alive 
 Give me one reason to doubt I am the apple of His eye 
 Just one reason now 
 Just one reason to doubt 
 Ah ah ah 
 Just one reason now 
 Just one reason to doubt 
 Jesus Christ 
 I see the faith of our fathers 
 Abraham, Issac, and Jacob 
 They never saw what was promised 
 But they never once felt forsaken 
 Through fire, famine, and sword 
 Tribulation and war 
 They never asked for a sign to believe in 
 So tell me how we stand in judgment and ever doubt Him 
 Give me one reason to doubt He is Messiah 
 Give me one reason to doubt He is alive 
 Give me one reason to doubt I am the apple of His eye 
 Just one reason now 
 Just one reason to doubt 
 Ah ah ah 
 Just one reason now 
 Just one reason to doubt 
 Ah ah ah 
 Just one reason now 
 Just one reason to doubt 
 Jesus Christ

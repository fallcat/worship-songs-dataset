I was told when I was young that one day soon I'm going to see You. 
 We'll take a train far from this place where all our pain will be over. 
 My God how I long to see You now. 
 And something in my heart tells me somehow You're one step away. 
 A distant sound is hard to hear even a sound as loud as thunder. 
 A distant heart is full of fear a distant soul has lost its' wonder. 
 Sometimes it's hard to hear Your voice, my God. 
 Is the reason that You're whispering because 
 You're one step away?

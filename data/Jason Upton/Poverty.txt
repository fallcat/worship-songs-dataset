There's a power in poverty that breaks principalities 
 And brings the authorities down to their knees 
 There's a brewing frustration and ageless temptation 
 To fight for control by some manipulation 
 But the God of the kingdoms and the God of the nations 
 The God of creation sends this revelation 
 Through the homeless and penniless Jesus the Son 
 The poor will inherit the Kingdom to come 
 Where will we turn when our world falls apart 
 And all of the treasures we've stored in our barns 
 Can't buy the Kingdom of God? 
 Who will we praise when we've praised all our lives 
 Men who build kingdoms and men who build fame 
 But heaven does not know their names? 
 And what will we fear when all that remains 
 Is God on the throne, with a child in his arms 
 And love in his eyes 
 And the sound of his heart cries

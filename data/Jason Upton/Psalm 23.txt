Your hands Reached into the depths of darkness 
 Your arms Pulled me to the light above 
 Your voice Spoke the word that broke my heart 
 Your eyes Burn with holy passion, fire, and love 
 You lead Me beside the quiet waters 
 You walk In the shadows of death's darkened door 
 You make Tables right before my enemies 
 You take oil and then you pour it over me 
 The Lord is my Shepherd, I will fear no evil 
 You are my Shepherd, God, I will fear no evil 
 Surely goodness and mercy cover me 
 All the days of my life they cover me 
 Surely I'm going to dwell in the house of the Lord 
 Forever and ever and ever and ever more

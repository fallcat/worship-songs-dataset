What have I done wrong 
 Was it something that I said 
 Was it something that you wanted 
 Was it something I withheld 
 What could be the reason that 
 You'd turn and walk away 
 Where could you be going 
 Are you coming back someday 
 My heart is slowly breaking 
 But one question still remains 
 How long will I be waiting 
 To see you here again 
 I love you and I still believe 
 That you will love me too 
 I love you if you return to me 
 I will return to you 
 To this place where I last saw you 
 I've returned a thousand times 
 A thousand tears have fallen 
 A thousand dreams have died 
 But I believe the day is dawning 
 I'll see you coming down the road 
 I've had a ring made for your finger 
 And the servants made a robe 
 And the calf has been made ready 
 Our favorite feast is overdue 
 Cause one chair at the table 
 Is empty without you

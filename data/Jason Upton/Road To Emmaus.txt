Have you ever said goodbye to a hero? 
 Have you ever had to lay away your dreams? 
 Have you ever been so lonely that a stranger is your best friend? 
 Then you'll know what I mean 
 So this is our highway to heaven 
 Our American dream 
 The two fools on the road to emmaus 
 Well they might as well be you and me 
 Have you ever been angry at your country? 
 Have you ever been angry at your God? 
 Have you ever been so angry that you can't see what you've got right in front of you? 
 Have you ever been distracted by the homeless? 
 Have you ever thrown your dollar with disgust? 
 Have you ever thought the great commission's just too great a cost? 
 Have you ever played the fool?

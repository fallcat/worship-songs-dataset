I've been calling you to go to the city 
 I've been watching you every day 
 Now I'm paying for a one way ticket 
 For a ship that sails the opposite way 
 And you laugh and you cry 
 And you live and you die 
 Cause you don't really know who you are 
 All alone in this world 
 Orphan boy orphan girl 
 Cause you don't really know who you are 
 Run baby run 
 My hands release you 
 Baby run baby run 
 Just as fast as you can 
 Run till your legs lead your heart to the real truth 
 You're my daughter my son 
 So run baby run baby run 
 Hear me laughing as you run from your calling 
 See me crying see me crying in the storms that rage 
 One way or another you will be going 
 To obey is such an easier way

Samuel, will you lend Me your ear? 
 This is the voice of your Father here 
 If I speak the word and no one has the vision 
 Can I count on you, my sweet child to listen? 
 Samuel, lend Me your ear 
 'Cause the whole world's in love with you, baby 
 I am in love with you child 
 You are so meek and mild, you are holy child 
 Samuel, lend Me your ear 
 Samuel, will you lend me your ear? 
 The truth is not always how things appear 
 So listen with your heart, listen to the spirit 
 Listen to My voice, child and you will hear it 
 Samuel, lend Me your ear 
 'Cause the whole world's in love with you, baby 
 I am in love with you child 
 You are so meek and mild, you are holy child 
 Samuel, lend Me your ear 
 There will be days you feel like flying 
 Then there'll be days you feel like crying 
 Never give up, never stop trying 
 Never believe My love is dying 
 'Cause the whole world's in love with you, baby 
 I am in love with you child 
 You are so meek and mild, you are holy child 
 Samuel, lend Me your ear

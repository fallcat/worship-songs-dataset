I want to know the secrets in your heart 
 I want to know what's in your head 
 I want to know the turns that you're taking 
 Give us minds to understand 
 Your kingdom, it's more real than we first believed 
 Your kingdom, it's more real, its more real than we first believed 
 Because our minds are new and our hearts are cleansed 
 And our eyes can see far better now than then 
 Just give us the courage, To open up our eyes 
 Give us the courage, We want to see 
 Just give us the courage, To open up our ears 
 Just give us the courage, 'Cause we want to see 
 And know more of you means less of me 
 But give me the courage Oh Father 
 To open up my eyes, I want to see, 
 With more of you there's less of me 
 But give me the courage of Father, 
 To open up my eyes, I want to see 
 To see into your kingdom 
 See the reality of my heart 
 Open up my eyes I want to see 
 I want to hear the whisper of your words 
 Your words of comforting 
 Open up my ears, I want to hear 
 Courage, courage, courage 
 Courage for your kingdom, 
 Courage for your change 
 You're changing me 
 And that's what I signed up for 
 To be changed into your image 
 Give me courage, I want to see, 
 And there's New places every day, 
 We want to see 
 And the motives, yeah the motives 
 Create divisions, we want to see 
 The motive, the interest that create division, 
 We want to see, 
 Cause your taking us higher than we've ever been 
 Great purifier, come purify me 
 Taking us higher than I've ever been before 
 Come Purifier, come purify me 
 You're taken me higher, than I've ever been before 
 Come purifier, come purify me 
 You're taken me higher, than I've ever been before 
 Come purifier, come purify me, me, me, me, me

Mommy, I hear the baby crying 
 Help me, are the words 
 She's implying 
 Where've I been while my world has been dying 
 Lord, teach me how to pray 
 Not my will or my plans or 
 The way I want it 
 I'm so tired of my hands in the way 
 So reveal to these eyes the true heart of my Father, today 
 Lord teach me how to pray 
 Daddy, I can hear Jesus crying 
 Help me, are the words 
 He's implying 
 Am I sleeping while my Savior 
 Is dying 
 Lord, teach me how to pray 
 Not my will or my plans or 
 The way I want it 
 I'm so tired of my hands in the way 
 So reveal to these eyes the true heart of my Father, today 
 Lord teach me how to pray 
 So I'll keep asking, for Your kingdom to come 
 Looking, for Your will to be done 
 For every nation, tribe, 
 And every tongue 
 Lord, teach me how to pray

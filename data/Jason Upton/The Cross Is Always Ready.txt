There's a pure and undefiled religion 
 Walking with You Jesus 
 You are the blessed hope 
 You are the risen Son 
 There are witnesses of resurrection calling everyone 
 To walk the royal way 
 To sing the kingdom song 
 The cross, cross is always ready 
 Every day it waits for me 
 Christ on narrow road our vision 
 Christ the everlasting seed 
 The cross, cross is always ready 
 Every day it waits for me 
 Christ on narrow road our vision 
 Christ the everlasting seed

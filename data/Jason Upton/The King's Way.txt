There is a road 
 That leads to peace that leads to life 
 But few will follow 
 We're at the crossroad 
 Which way will we go 
 There is not today a more holy way 
 Than the steps that lead me to the cross 
 Where my will can't be the priority 
 And these crowns I've gained I count as loss 
 When I hear the spirit say 
 That this is the true King's way

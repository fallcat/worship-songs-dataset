We are one in the Spirit 
 We are one in the Lord 
 We are one in the Spirit 
 We are one in the Lord 
 And we pray that all unity 
 May one day be restored 
 And they'll know we are Christians 
 By our love, By our love 
 Yes, they'll know we are Christians 
 By our love 
 We will walk with each other 
 We will walk hand in hand 
 We will walk with each other 
 We will walk hand in hand 
 And together we'll spread the news 
 That God is in our land 
 We will work with each other 
 We will work side by side 
 We will work with each other 
 We will work side by side 
 And we'll guard each man's dignity 
 And save each man's pride 
 All praise to the Father 
 From whom all things come 
 And all praise to Christ Jesus His only son 
 And all praise to the Spirit 
 Who makes us one 
 Make us one, Lord! 
 Make us one, Lord!

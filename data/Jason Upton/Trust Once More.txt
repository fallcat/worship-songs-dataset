Somebody here is hurting 
 Somebody here is broken 
 Somebody here is waiting 
 Somebody here is hoping 
 For love to come and unlock every door 
 Takes you and me to open up once more 
 And learn to trust again 
 Somebody here is searching 
 Somebody's dreams were stolen 
 Somebody's arms are reaching 
 Somebody needs to hold them 
 I don't know where you come from 
 I don't know where you're going 
 I only know the healing 
 Starts when we stop running 
 Peace Like a river 
 Joy like a fountain 
 Drinking the cup of my father 
 Flying over this mountain

I'm just a bird with a melody to sing 
 I'm hardly heard look at these tiny little wings 
 But I can see an arrow flying and I'm not afraid 
 I can hear the terror try to steal the night away 
 And I'm not afraid I'm not afraid 
 I am hiding here in your shadow 
 Riding under your wings 
 And I am flying trusting the angels 
 And living in your covering 
 And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid 
 I'm just a bird without a penny to my name 
 It may sound absurd I've got no plans beyond today 
 But I can see an arrow flying and I'm not afraid 
 I can hear the terror try to steal the night away 
 But I'm not afraid, I am not afraid 
 I am hiding here in your shadow 
 And riding under your wings 
 And I am flying trusting the angels 
 And living in your covering 
 I am hiding here in your shadow 
 And riding under your wings 
 And I am flying trusting the angels 
 And living in your covering 
 And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

Baby look up there's our star in the middle of the sky 
 Shining where we are to comfort you and I 
 While I hold you in the dark I hope you see the light 
 And the passion of my heart in this simple lullaby 
 Daddy don't sleep daddy don't slumber 
 I don't wonder when it thunders 
 If I'm safe in daddy's arms (repeat) 
 Daddy look up there's our star I hear you say to me 
 Something deep inside says I never want to leave 
 So I need for you to know whenever I go 
 God is in control and you are in His arms

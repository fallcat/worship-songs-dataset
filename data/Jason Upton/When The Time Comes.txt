You are wisdom but you ask questions 
 Thank you God for never telling me a lie 
 Your decisions are mostly hidden 
 The stage you stand upon is not for human eyes 
 You tell me not to worry about tomorrow But I worry anyway 
 You tell me you'll take care of all my troubles 
 Jesus, teach me how to wait 
 You are future but you are present 
 Thank you God for never running from your past 
 You're committed to your creation 
 For everything you've made your love forever lasts 
 You tell me not to worry about tomorrow but I worry anyway 
 You tell me you'll take care of all my troubles 
 Jesus, teach me how to wait 
 When the time comes, I will see forever 
 When the time comes, It'll be all right 
 When the time comes, I will be the one asking why

When you were a child 
 I called you my own 
 And you were mine 
 When you were a child 
 You could not standalone 
 But you were fine 
 I want to know that child again 
 Maybe time has changed you 
 But Love remembers when 
 You called my name and like the wind 
 I carried you away 
 It seems like only yesterday 
 When You were a child 
 When you were a child 
 The world was the unknown 
 But you were wise 
 To simply trust in me 
 That I will never leave 
 And hold on tight

I'm not looking over and I'm not looking under 
 I'm looking upward and I'm moving onward 
 To a place where they cry holy 
 And the greatest man bows lowly 
 From the wonder of a father crying out 
 Come now let's reason together 
 Come now where blood turns to wool 
 Come now where fire is the measure 
 Come now where fools turn to gold 
 Now I'm moving slower and it takes a little longer 
 But I'm healing deeper and I'm feeling stronger 
 It's tearing down defenses and opening my senses 
 To the wonder of a lover crying out 
 Come now let's reason together 
 Come now where blood turns to wool 
 Come now where fire is the measure 
 Come now where fools turn to gold

Kids they say the darnedest things 
 They can make you laugh 
 They can make you scream 
 They make me want to be a better man. 
 Johnny, he done lost his toy 
 He gave it to another boy 
 And I asked him, 
 "Johnny, why did you do that?" 
 He said, "That kid he asked me if he could use it?" 
 I said, "Yeah, you can. If you don't lose it!" 
 So, he took my toy and I never saw it again. 
 Well I hope that you have lots of luck 
 'Cause that was my favorite toy 
 That was my toy truck 
 I should have told you "no", but I told you "yes". 
 Yes 
 Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes 
 Well I've never been the givin' kind 
 But the more I watch this child of mine 
 The more that I begin to understand 
 That it's easier to just say "no" 
 But it ain't no fun to play alone 
 And the more I say "I can't", the less I can 
 Johnny he turned seventeen 
 And he found the truck of every young man's dream 
 I should have told him "no" but I told him "yes" 
 Yes

I come with a heart that is desperate 
 And I cry wanting just to be heard by You 
 And I pray that You won't remain silent 
 That You'll stand here beside me 
 That my heart won't call out in vain 
 Cause all I want 
 Is just to see You, Jesus 
 And I long 
 Just to hear Your voice 
 And I need 
 Just to be near You 
 Cause Your presence is 
 All I want 
 I come with a heart that is hungry 
 And I sing wanting You just to know my love 
 And I pray that my life will be counted 
 For the sake of Your kingdom 
 That my heart will be truly Yours 
 Cause all I want 
 Is just to see You, Jesus 
 And I long 
 Just to hear Your voice 
 And I need 
 Just to be near You 
 Cause Your presence is 
 All I want 
 One day we'll look on Your face, oh 
 We'll see You in all of Your glory 
 And we won't need the sun 
 And we won't need the moon 
 All we will need is You 
 All I want 
 Is just to see You, Jesus 
 And I long 
 Just to hear Your voice 
 And I need 
 Just to be near You (just to be near You) 
 Cause Your presence is 
 All I want 
 All I want 
 Is just to see You, Jesus 
 And I long 
 Just to hear Your voice 
 And I need 
 Just to be near You 
 Cause Your presence is 
 All I want 
 Yes, Your presence is all I want 
 Cause Your presence is 
 All I want 
 Cause Your presence is 
 All I want 
 Yeah 
 And all I want 
 Is You 
 And I need You 
 Your presence 
 All I want is You, 
 Jesus 
 Jesus 
 All I want 
 The rest is all spoken 
 Yeah, I mean we've got to get to the point in our lives 
 Where we actually believe that God and His desires for us 
 Are truly the things that are going to make us happiest 
 Give us the most peace and satisfy our souls deeply 
 We talk about this, and we know in our minds that it's true 
 Somehow these beliefs, they don't make their way into our everyday lives 
 I mean, if they did, wouldn't we be different?  Wouldn't we act different? 
 Wouldn't we talk different? 
 I don't think it's because we don't want to be happy, 
 Or that we try to sabotage our own lives 
 Maybe we just don't really trust God 
 We've got to decide that no matter what the cost 
 We want to be satisfied in God alone, in Him alone 
 And aren't you tired of reading the Bible because you feel you have to? 
 I want to want to love Jesus 
 I want to long to spend time with Him 
 I want to get up in the morning and can't wait to be with Him 
 And anything in my life that is more exciting and more valuable to me than God 
 That thing's an idol 
 I don't want it to be like that 
 I want to be like John Piper said in 
 The Pleasures Of God 
 "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him" 
 I want God to be glorified, so I want to see what I can do 
 To be most satisfied in Him

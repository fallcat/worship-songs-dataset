I'm reaching up 
 I'm reaching out 
 To be with You, Lord 
 I wanna be with You now 
 There's nothing quite like 
 Your voice in my ear 
 It's gentle and soft 
 You know it's honest and real 
 I open my hands 
 And I open my heart 
 As I lift You up from the earth 
 Won't You draw me in 
 Won't You pull me close 
 As I lift Your name to the Heavens 
 Won't You call me home 
 Won't You call everyone to Your throne 
 Won't You draw everyone to Your throne 
 If it is true 
 Then how can it be 
 The thing You want most 
 From me is intimacy 
 I try in my power 
 To give you enough 
 But first what You ask 
 Is that I give You my love 
 Come make me all that You want me to be 
 My praises working that all would believe 
 Change us for all of eternity

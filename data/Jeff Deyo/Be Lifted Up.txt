Spoken: 
 Remember. 
 John 12:32 says when Jesus is lifted up from the earth, He's going to draw all people to Himself. 
 So we can know that there is more power in our songs tonight than just melodies, as we worship Him, He is drawing everyone around us, including ourselves, to Him, and even people outside the vessel, in the neighborhoods, and the cities beyond, to worship Him.

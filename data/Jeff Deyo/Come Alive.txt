I could be up or down 
 I could be lost or found 
 But if I call Your name, You're here 
 I could be rich or poor 
 There could be peace or war 
 But if I call Your name, You're here 
 And I come alive when I'm with You 
 One look in Your eyes and I'm made new 
 My heart is restored, my soul is reborn 
 Whenever I'm with you 
 I come alive, I come alive 
 I could be near or far 
 I could be past the stars 
 But if I call Your name, You're here 
 It could be day or dark 
 I could be losing heart 
 But if I call Your name, You're here 
 And I come alive when I'm with You 
 One look in Your eyes and I'm made new 
 My heart is restored, my soul is reborn 
 Whenever I'm with you 
 Wanna seek You, wanna please You 
 Wanna spend my whole life loving You 
 Need to feel You, need to reach You 
 Need to know You're here 
 And I come alive when I'm with You 
 One look in Your eyes and I'm made new 
 My heart is restored, my soul is reborn 
 Whenever I'm with you 
 I come alive when I'm with You 
 One look in Your eyes and I'm made new 
 My heart is restored, my soul is reborn 
 Whenever I'm with you 
 I come alive, I come alive 
 I come alive, I come alive 
 Oh, make me want to be alive 
 Make me want to be alive, be alive 
 Make me come alive

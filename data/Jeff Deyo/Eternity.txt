You turn the night into a sunrise 
 You melt my heart with every touch 
 You turn the tide when every hope seems lost 
 You hold us all within Your hands 
 From eternity to eternity 
 You preside over all in Your majesty 
 You have purchased me, You loved me jealously 
 You abide in our hearts ever more 
 You turn the hearts of kings and kingdoms 
 You're reaching out to every child 
 You turn a light to every darkened soul 
 You hold us all within Your hands 
 From eternity to eternity 
 You preside over all in Your majesty 
 You have purchased me, You loved me jealously 
 You abide in our hearts ever more 
 You spoke a word and made the heavens 
 You broke the power of sin and death 
 No other god can now oppose You, Lord 
 You hold us all within Your hands 
 You hold us all within Your hands 
 You hold us all within Your hands 
 From eternity to eternity 
 You preside over all in Your majesty 
 You have purchased me, You loved me jealously 
 You abide in our hearts 
 From eternity to eternity 
 You preside over all in Your majesty 
 You have purchased me, You loved me jealously 
 You abide in our hearts 
 You abide in our hearts 
 You abide in our hearts ever more

Welcome sweet Spirit 
 Come stir me with Your fire 
 Whisper Your secrets 
 Your deepest hearts desire 
 I will obey 
 I will be true 
 I will be poured out 
 Just for You 
 Fill me with Your power 
 Birth Your passion in my soul 
 Let Your Holy Spirit 
 Fall on me, fall on me 
 Fill me with Your purpose 
 Place Your Kingdom in my heart 
 Let Your Holy Spirit 
 Fall on me

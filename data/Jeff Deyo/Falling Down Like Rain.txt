I can see a change in me 
 Since you came into my heart 
 I can find a peace inside 
 Since you came into my heart 
 I can feel this heart of mine 
 Falling for my King 
 I can feel this love of Yours 
 All around 
 Falling down like rain 
 Your love is falling on my face 
 Falling down like rain 
 Your love is here 
 Your love is near 
 Love is here in place of fear 
 Since You came into my heart 
 Gone is doubt, now faith abounds 
 Since You came into my heart

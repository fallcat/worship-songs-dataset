I want to go where I can know 
 All of Your mysteries 
 Leaning on You, being renewed 
 All for eternity 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Glory rain down 
 Fill up my life 
 Open the gates 
 Open the skies 
 Glory rain down 
 Fill up my soul 
 Fill up my soul 
 I want to stay where I can praise 
 All of Your majesty 
 Living by faith, loving Your name 
 All for world to see

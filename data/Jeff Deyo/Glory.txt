My eyes have seen 
 A glimpse of You 
 And ever will they yearn 
 To see You as 
 They will, my Lord 
 The hour of Your return 
 Creation groans 
 For that great day 
 When Heav'n and earth collide 
 When every heart 
 With one pure voice 
 Will bow to You and cry 
 Glory, glory 
 Glory to the Lamb 
 With praise we war 
 Against the night 
 This battle we have won 
 Because of Christ 
 Our Savior King 
 At last it will be done 
 With blood stained tears 
 And nine inch nails 
 You rescued my poor heart 
 In laying down 
 A sinless life 
 You overcame the dark

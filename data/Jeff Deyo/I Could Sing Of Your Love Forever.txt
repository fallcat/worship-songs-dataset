Over the mountains and the sea 
 Your river runs with love for me 
 And I will open up my heart 
 And let the healer set me free 
 I'm happy to be in the truth 
 And I will daily lift my hands 
 For I will always sing 
 Of when your love came down 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 Over the mountains and the sea 
 Your river runs with love for me 
 And I will open up my heart 
 And let the healer set me free 
 I'm happy to be in the truth 
 And I will daily lift my hands 
 For I will always sing 
 Of when your love came down 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 Oh, I feel like dancing 
 This foolishness, unknown 
 But when the world has seen the light 
 They will dance with joy 
 Like we're dancing now 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever 
 I could sing of your love forever

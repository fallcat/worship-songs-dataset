I humble myself before you 
 I lay myself down below you 
 In reverence I bow 
 Beneath you, my Lord 
 I draw near to you forever 
 My Savior, my God, my Treasure 
 I stand here in awe 
 Indebted to you, my Lord 
 'Cause I fear you, my God 
 And I fear you, my King 
 And I trust you with my soul 
 And I love you with all my heart 
 And I fear you with all my life 
 I feel like a child around you 
 As I let all my praise surroud you 
 And I fall on my face 
 Astounded, my Lord 
 You hold the oceans within your hand 
 You count the galaxies 
 You know the mysteries of this world 
 You see what no one sees 
 Your hand can span the whole universe 
 You gave the stars their fame 
 You know my deepest of secrets, Lord 
 But still you have called me by name

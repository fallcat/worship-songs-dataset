I know my heart is Yours 
 I know my world is your hands 
 I know my destiny 
 I know with You is where I stand 
 My life is not my own 
 The price was paid by 
 You alone 
 I forever praise you 
 I forever hold you high 
 I forever love Your name, Jesus 
 I forever trust You 
 I forever give my life 
 I forever love Your name, Jesus 
 I know my past is gone 
 I know my sin is washed away 
 I know my purpose now 
 I know I'm here to live my praise 
 My life is not my own 
 My heart belongs to 
 You alone

No one moves me like you 
 No one loves me like you 
 No one cares like you do 
 No one 
 I just want to be 
 Where you want me to be 
 I just want to stay with you 
 I love you 
 I need you 
 I praise you 
 I love you (Jesus) 
 No one knows me like you 
 No one fills me like you 
 No one holds like you do 
 No one 
 I love you 
 I bless you 
 I thank you 
 I love you (Jesus) 
 I just want to be 
 Where you want me to be 
 I just want to say 
 What you want me to say 
 I just want to be 
 Who you want me to be 
 I just want your way in me

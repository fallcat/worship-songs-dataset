Hallelujah 
 I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold 
 I'd rather be His than have riches untold 
 I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land 
 I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand 
 Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sins dread sway 
 Oh, I'd rather have Jesus than anything 
 This world affords today 
 I'd rather have Jesus than vain applause 
 I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause 
 I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame 
 I'd rather be true to His holy name 
 Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sins dread sway 
 Oh, I'd rather have Jesus than anything 
 This world affords 
 Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sins dread sway 
 Oh, I'd rather have Jesus than anything 
 This world affords today 
 Today

 Today 
 I'd rather have Jesus 
 I'd rather have Jesus 
 I'd rather have Jesus 
 He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom 
 He's sweeter than honey from out of the comb 
 He's all that my hungering spirit needs 
 I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead, oh 
 Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sins dread sway 
 Just to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sins dread sway 
 Oh, I'd rather have Jesus than anything 
 This world affords 
 To be the king of a vast domain or be held in sins dread sway 
 Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sins dread sway 
 Oh, I'd rather have Jesus than anything 
 This world affords 
 This world affords 
 This world affords 
 Today, today

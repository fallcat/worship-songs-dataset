The whole thing is spoken 
 I pray that You would renew who Jesus is in our hearts tonight 
 We love You 
 You know, sometimes I run into a lot of people that have grown numb in their 
 Hearts towards the story of the cross 
 If there's ever one thing that should keep us worshiping 
 It should be the story of the greatest sacrifice that was ever made 
 For you, and for me -- by Jesus, the Son of the living God on a cross 
 It's true, isn't it? 
 I tell you, if you ever forget why you worship the Lord 
 If you ever forget 
 Go back to Isaiah 53 and read the story of the cross 
 Go back to the Gospels and read the story of the cross 
 'Cause Jesus is the central reason we worship God 
 He's the reason that we're able to worship God 
 Without Jesus' sacrifice there's no way we could come close to the Father 
 But because of Jesus, we can come close to the throne of God 
 And worship the Lord 
 And I just want to say this:  If there is anybody here tonight 
 Who didn't really understand what this whole thing was all about 
 You didn't understand what this whole weekend was about 
 Parachute 
 But now the lights in your heart are starting to come on 
 I say this:  Make tonight the night that you stretch your hands forth 
 To worship the God who created you, maybe for the very first time 
 So if there's anybody here tonight 
 Who has never accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior 
 I would encourage you right now to do that very thing. 
 The Bible says, I wanna read it 
 In Acts, a very simple thing 
 Now, you may have come to a worship concert or 
 Something like our event like today 
 You may not understand what are all these people doing? 
 Why are they raising their hands?  Why are they crying out to God? 
 It says this in Acts 3, verse 19 and 20 
 "Now turn from your sins, and turn to God, so you can be cleansed of your sins." 
 That's really the gospel message 
 Jesus came to make a way for our sins to be forgiven 
 He's already offered forgiveness to everyone here today 
 And it's a matter -- it's up to you whether you receive His forgiveness 
 And you turn from your sin, and you turn to God 
 And verse 20 it says this: 
 "Then wonderful times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord" 
 And 
 "Then wonderful times of refreshment will come in the presence of the Lord" 
 "And He will send Jesus, your Messiah, your Messiah to you again." 
 So even as we sing this next song

Here at Your feet, I'll always be 
 With the Angels crying, 'Holy' 
 There's not one thing that means 
 As much to me as You my God, as You my King 
 Here in the darkness 
 I lift my eyes to You 
 Your light comes shining through 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer, I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter, be my God 
 Here at Your feet, I'll always be 
 With the Angels crying holy 
 There's no one else who can compare to you 
 The righteous One, the perfect Son 
 Here in this silence 
 I hear You speak my name 
 And I cry out to You 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer, I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter, be my God 
 Be my God 
 Be my God 
 Here in the darkness 
 I lift my eyes to You 
 Your light comes shining through 
 Here in this silence 
 I hear You speak my name 
 And I cry out to You 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer, I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter, be my God 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer, I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter, be my God 
 Be my God 
 Be my God 
 Be my God 
 Be my God

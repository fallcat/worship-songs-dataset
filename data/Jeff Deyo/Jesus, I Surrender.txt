Spoken: 
 Hey, You're so good, Lord 
 We can't get enough of You, God 
 We're not just saying that 
 It's not just words, it's not just a melody 
 But God, it's real, it's true - from our hearts 
 I'm going to teach you this song, it's called "Jesus, I Surrender." 
 Here at Your feet 
 I'll always be 
 With the angels 
 Crying holy 
 There's not one thing 
 That means as much to me 
 As You my God 
 As You my King 
 Here in the darkness 
 I lift my eyes to You 
 Your light comes shining through 
 Sing it out 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer 
 I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter 
 Be my God 
 Here at Your feet 
 I'll always be 
 With the angels 
 Crying holy 
 There's no one else 
 Who can compare to You 
 The righteous One 
 The perfect Son 
 Here in this silence 
 I hear You speak my name 
 And I cry out to You, yeah 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer 
 I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter 
 Be my God 
 Be my God 
 Be my God 
 Here in the darkness 
 I lift my eyes to You 
 Your light comes shining through 
 Here in the silence (spoken) 
 Here in this silence 
 I hear You speak my name 
 And I cry out to You, oh 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer 
 I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter 
 Be my God 
 I surrender 
 Jesus, I surrender 
 I draw nearer 
 I fall down 
 Master, be my Savior 
 Be my shelter 
 Be my God 
 Oh, be my God 
 Be my God 
 Be my God 
 Be my God 
 Everything below is spoken 
 You know, for me worship is so much more than a song 
 It's so much more, even though I'm a worship leader 
 And that's what I do for my life 
 Worship leading is just a small part of actually worshiping God 
 If our actions don't match up to the songs that we sing 
 Then we're just giving God lip service 
 We fall under that same category that Israel fell into 
 God said that they were a people whose lips honored Him 
 But whose hearts were far from Him 
 I don't know about you guys, but I don't want to be like that 
 I want to be one who's after God's heart 
 Amen 
 This next song we're going to do talks just about that exact thing 
 It talks about giving our hearts to God 
 And we have a lot of songs that say, 
 "Lord, I give You my heart, I give You my life, I give You my soul" 
 But the thing that I want to get through our heads and our hearts tonight 
 Is that once you give your heart to God, you don't ever take it back 
 So that's what I encourage you as we sing this song 
 This song is called "Keep My Heart" 
 I want this song to be your song 
 Say," Lord, I give You my heart and I don't want it back."

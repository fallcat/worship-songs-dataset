Keep my heart 
 Keep my heart 
 Oh 
 Keep my heart 
 Nothing left but these pieces 
 Nothing here except my broken life 
 All I offer is all I have 
 I lay my life beneath Your throne 
 Keep my heart 
 I give it to You, Lord 
 As I offer mine 
 Will You give me Yours 
 Keep my heart 
 Till the closing of time 
 And I'll worship You 
 For all of my life 
 Keep my heart 
 Keep my heart 
 Spoken 
 Now you know it, you can sing it with us 
 No one here but Your Spirit 
 No one here to hear just how I feel 
 Just to know that I long for You 
 To teach me just to trust Your hand 
 Keep my heart 
 I give it to You, Lord 
 As I offer mine 
 Will You give me Yours 
 Keep my heart 
 Till the closing of time 
 And I'll worship You 
 For all of my life 
 Keep my heart 
 Keep my heart 
 Keep my heart 
 Oh 
 Jesus 
 I don't know if I told You 
 How I long for Your heart 
 I've just got to be like You, oh Lord 
 I've just got to be Yours 
 Spoken: 
 Sing it again 
 I don't know if I told You 
 How I long for Your heart, Jesus 
 I've just got to be like You, oh 
 I've just got to be Yours 
 Oh, oh 
 I've just got to be Yours 
 I don't know if I told You 
 How I long for Your heart 
 How I long for Your heart, 
 Just got to be like You 
 I've just got to be like You, 
 I've just to to be Yours 
 I've just got to be Yours 
 Spoken 
 One more time. 
 I don't know if I told You 
 I don't know if I told You, Jesus 
 How I long for Your heart 
 I've just got to be like You, 
 I've just got to be Yours 
 Oh 
 I don't know if I told You 
 Tell Him now 
 How I long for Your heart 
 Oh, we long for You 
 I've just got to be like You, Jesus 
 I've just got to be Yours 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, I've got to be like You, Lord 
 I've got to be like You 
 Oh, I want to have Your heart 
 I've just got to be Yours 
 Spoken: 
 Just close Your eyes 
 And let the Spirit of God wash over You 
 If you have tears, let them flow.  It's healing. 
 Just love Him. 
 It's not a Bible story, it's not just a fairy tale. 
 It's not just a story in a book. 
 He's real.  He loves you more than you can imagine. 
 His love is never failing, He's perfect.

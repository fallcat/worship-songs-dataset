Saturate album version: 
 Oh 
 We have come to bring our praise 
 To the One who changes hearts 
 We are moved by Your love 
 As You give Yourself to us 
 And we pledge to give ourselves 
 That the world will know Your grace 
 This grace that captures me, oh 
 I wanna see Your Spirit moving through the streets 
 Touching everyone, to bring us to our knees 
 So won't You pour out from the rivers of my soul 
 And let it flow, yeah, just let it flow, let it flow

 Touching everyone, to bring us to our knees 
 So won't You pour out from the rivers of my soul

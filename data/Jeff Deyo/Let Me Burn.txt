Oh, oh 
 You are the stream that flows in the desert 
 Reviving my heart and flooding my soul 
 You are the flame that splits through the darkness 
 To burn up my sin and point where to go 
 And I worship You 
 Straight to You I run 
 Lord, my cry is this 
 That Your will be done 
 Let the nations rejoice in You 
 Let Your people return to You 
 Let the source of my life be You 
 Let me burn for You 
 Let Your fire of justice reign 
 Let creation confess Your  name 
 Turn my heart from stone to clay 
 Let me burn with praise 
 You are the wind that moves through the stillness 
 Removing my doubt and lifting my wings 
 You are the Rock that's there in the quicksand 
 To crush all Your foes and steady my feet 
 And I worship You 
 Straight to You I run 
 Singing songs of joy 
 Of Your Kingdom come 
 Let the nations rejoice in You 
 Let Your people return to You 
 Let the source of my life be You 
 Let me burn for You 
 Let Your fire of justice reign 
 Let creation confess Your  name 
 Turn my heart from stone to clay 
 Let me burn, let me burn with praise, oh with praise 
 You are the wind that moves through the stillness 
 Removing my doubt and lifting my wings 
 You are the rock that's there in the quicksand 
 To crush all Your foes and steady my feet 
 And I worship You 
 Straight to You I run 
 Singing songs of joy 
 Of Your Kingdom come 
 Let the nations rejoice in You 
 Let Your people return to You 
 Let the source of my life be You 
 Let me burn for You 
 Let Your fire of justice reign 
 Let creation confess Your  name 
 Turn my heart from stone to clay 
 Let me burn 
 Let the nations rejoice in You 
 Let Your people return to You 
 Let the source of my life be You 
 Let me burn for You 
 Let Your fire of justice reign 
 Let creation confess Your  name 
 Turn my heart from stone to clay 
 Let me burn, let me burn 
 Oh, let me burn, let me burn for You, Jesus 
 Let Your people return, Lord, return to You, return to You 
 Have mercy, have mercy 
 Let me burn, let me burn, let me burn with praise 
 Ooo, with praise

I stand here in awe, and I lift up a song 
 With all my heart, with all my soul 
 My God made a way, so I sing out in praise 
 With all my mind, with all my strength 
 Magnify, glorify 
 All the earth, testify 
 Magnify, glorify 
 Let us love the Lord Most High 
 Let us love the Lord Most High 
 Renewed and restored, I trust in the Lord 
 With all my heart, with all my soul 
 Resolved and redeemed, I worship the King 
 With all my mind, with all my strength 
 Magnify, glorify 
 All the earth, testify 
 Magnify, glorify 
 Let us love the Lord Most High 
 Let us love the Lord Most High 
 The Lord Most High 
 We believe and we delight, in God our Rock, the Lord Most High 
 And we exist to praise His holy name 
 No one else in earth or sky compares to Him, the Lord Most High 
 And we exist to praise His holy name 
 Magnify, glorify 
 All the earth, testify 
 Magnify, glorify 
 Let us love the Lord Most High 
 Let us love the Lord Most High 
 The Lord Most High

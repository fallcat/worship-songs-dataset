Saturate album version: 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Here I am longing, I can't stop this longing 
 For more of You in me 
 Lost in this moment, this beautiful moment 
 This prayer I sing to You 
 I'm crying out to You 
 To change the way I think 
 To steal away my pride 
 And make me new 
 Saturate my life 
 Fill every part of me with You 
 Drown me in Your love 
 Let me lose myself in You 
 In You, in You 
 Here I am longing, I can't stop this longing 
 For more of You in me 
 Lost in this moment, this beautiful moment 
 This prayer I sing to You 
 I gladly come to You 
 I want no place to hide 
 I'm pouring out my heart 
 To give You room 
 Oh 
 Saturate my life 
 Fill every part of me with You 
 Drown me in Your love 
 Let me lose myself 
 Saturate my life 
 Fill every part of me with You 
 Drown me in Your love 
 Let me lose myself in You 
 Let me lose myself 
 La la... 
 Saturate my life 
 Fill every part of me with You 
 Drown me in Your love 
 Let me lose myself 
 I'm crying out to You 
 To change the way I think 
 To steal away my pride 
 And make me new inside 
 I gladly come to You (I gladly come to You) 
 I want no place to hide 
 I'm pouring out my heart (I'm pouring out) 
 To give You room 
 Saturate my life 
 Fill every part of me with You 
 Drown me in Your love 
 Let me lose myself 
 Saturate my life 
 Fill every part of me with You 
 Drown me in Your love 
 Let me lose myself in You 
 Let me lose myself in You 
 Let me lose myself in You 
 Lose myself, lose myself, lose myself in You 
 Lose myself, lose myself, lose myself in You 
 Lose myself in You

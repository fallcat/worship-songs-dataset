Love will find a way 
 When nothing else remains 
 And love is who You are 
 Love is who You are 
 And love will break the chains 
 If only by Your grace 
 Cause love is who You are 
 Love is who You are 
 Love is who You are 
 God, You are love, love so deep 
 Deep and mighty 
 God, You are love, love so pure 
 Pure and holy 
 Love will find a way 
 When nothing else remains 
 And love is who You are 
 Love is who You are 
 And love will break the chains 
 If only by Your grace 
 Cause love is who You are 
 Love is who You are 
 Love is who You are 
 Oh God, You are love, love so deep 
 Deep and mighty 
 God, You are love, love so pure 
 Pure and holy 
 Love, love is patient 
 Love is mercy, love is kind 
 Love, love is power 
 Love is justice, love divine 
 Whoa... whoa... 
 God, You are love, love so deep 
 Deep and mighty 
 God, You are love, love so pure 
 Pure and holy

Nothing in heaven or on earth 
 Ever will keep me from Your love 
 Love that is more than all I need 
 Love that is everything to me 
 Now I will give away this love 
 Just as it gave itself for me 
 Rivers of living water flow 
 So that the world might come to know 
 The love of God is great 
 The love of God is good 
 The love of God runs deep 
 The love of God 
 The love of God is true 
 The love of God is sweet 
 The love of God runs deep 
 The love of God 
 There is a love that conquers all 
 It is the power to set us free 
 Free of the cares this world pursues 
 Free to be given unto You 
 Loving You is amazing 
 Loving You is amazing

A crown of thorns 
 A mockery 
 Of You my God 
 Of You my King 
 You took my place 
 A place so bleak and cold (and cold) 
 A crown of thorns 
 A symbol of 
 A desperate deed 
 Your desperate love 
 Your kindness, Lord 
 Resounds inside of me 
 There will never be 
 A crown so cruel 
 You wore it like a King 
 A King of fools 
 You will always be 
 The only King of Kings 
 A crown of thorns 
 A crown of hate 
 For all You had 
 For all You gave 
 The King of all 
 Would rather serve than reign 
 There will never be 
 A crown so cruel 
 You wore it like a King 
 A King of fools 
 You will always be 
 The only King of Kings 
 Crowned with many crowns 
 Crowned with many crowns 
 Crowned with many crowns 
 You are crowned with many crowns 
 A crown of thorns 
 A crown of death 
 Forsaken by 
 Both God and man 
 But You prevailed 
 To live and reign again 
 And I know that 
 There will never be 
 A crown so cruel 
 You wore it like a King 
 A King of fools 
 You will always be 
 The only King of Kings, yeah 
 There will never be 
 A crown so cruel 
 You wore it like a King 
 A King of fools 
 You will always be 
 The only King of Kings 
 The only King of Kings 
 The only King of Kings

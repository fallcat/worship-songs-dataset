Every day, every day I will live for 
 For the One who has come as my Savior 
 Living loud, here and now 
 I will shout Your fame 
 Evermore, evermore I'll adore You 
 Thankful for every door that I break through 
 In the trials and the smiles 
 I will give You praise 
 You mean more than every breath and 
 You free me with every step and ... 
 You heal my broken heart and 
 That's why I keep on falling more in love 
 More in love 
 You take me where You are and 
 That's why I keep on falling more in love 
 So much more in love with You 
 You are the sun light 
 You are the falling rain 
 You are the mountains 
 You always stay the same 
 Stay the same

I see a mountain, standing in the way 
 A mountain of failure, a mountain of shame 
 And there is an ocean, drowning me in fear 
 An ocean of worry, an ocean of tears 
 But I know You have taken me this far 
 So I'll rise and I'll sing of who You are 
 You alone hold the nations in Your hands 
 And You alone are moving mountains in these lands 
 And You alone know the secrets I have saved 
 And the dreams that I have chased 
 And You alone, You are worthy of my praise 
 I see a picture, of all that I'll become 
 A picture of beauty, a picture of love 
 There is a vision, growing in my mind 
 A vision of triumph, a vision of life 
 For I know You have taken me this far 
 So I'll rise and I'll sing of who You are 
 You alone hold the nations in Your hands 
 And You alone are moving mountains in these lands 
 And You alone know the secrets I have saved 
 And the dreams that I have chased 
 And You alone, You are worthy of my praise 
 You are worthy, worthy, worthy 
 You alone 
 You're worthy, worthy, worthy, oh oh 
 You are worthy, worthy 
 And now in faith we speak 
 And mountains move as we believe 
 And now in faith we speak 
 And mountains move as we believe 
 And now in faith we speak 
 And mountains move as we believe 
 And now in faith we speak 
 And mountains move as we believe 
 You alone hold the nations in Your hands 
 And You alone are moving mountains in these lands 
 And You alone know the secrets I have saved 
 And the dreams that I have chased 
 And You alone hold the nations in Your hands 
 And You alone are moving mountains in these lands 
 And You alone know the secrets I have saved 
 And the dreams that I have chased 
 And You alone, You are worthy of my praise 
 You are worthy, worthy, worthy 
 Worthy, worthy, worthy 
 You are worthy, worthy, worthy 
 You are worthy, worthy

I take my refuge in the palm of Your hand 
 I take my comfort in Your perfect plan 
 I take my sorrow and lay it down at Your feet 
 I take my refuge where I can be free 
 In You, Oh Lord 
 In You, my God 
 When there's no where to turn 
 And there's nothing that's true 
 I find my peace here in You (2x) 
 I take my shelter in the shade of Your wings 
 I take my pleasure in the hope that You bring 
 I take my weakness to the foot of the cross 
 I take my refuge where I can get lost 
 I worship You, Lord 
 For all that You are 
 I stretch out my faith 
 And lay down my heart 
 There's no where else 
 That I'd rather be 
 Than where there's more You, Lord 
 And where there's less me 
 In You, Oh Lord 
 In You, my God 
 When there's no where to turn 
 And there's nothing that's true 
 I find my peace here in You (2x) 
 I will worship You with all my heart, my soul 
 I will worship You with all my mind, my strength. (2x)

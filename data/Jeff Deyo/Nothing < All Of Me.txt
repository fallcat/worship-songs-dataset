Spoken: 
 This song is a song about the cross. 
 It's a song called "Nothing Less Than All Of Me." 
 So, Jesus, tonight we say this: 
 You have given everything for us.   You have give us Your life, You have poured out Your blood, You have given Your body as a sacrifice, so that we can come to the Father.  And we say that by the power of God that lives in us that we will offer nothing less than all of us.  So we do it now, God, through our songs and through our lives. 
 Jesus

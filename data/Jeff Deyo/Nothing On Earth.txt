Every moonlit night 
 Every purple mountain 
 Lives to bring all glory 
 To Jesus 
 Every ocean swell 
 Every flowing fountain 
 Lives to bring all glory 
 To Jesus 
 Every star in every sky 
 Is loving You 
 Nothing on earth 
 Nothing on earth 
 Compares to You 
 Compares to You 
 My Lord 
 Every lightning flash 
 Every roll of thunder 
 Lives to bring all glory 
 To Jesus 
 Everyone, everywhere 
 Is praising You 
 Every star in every sky 
 Is loving You

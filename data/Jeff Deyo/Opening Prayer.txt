Spoken: 
 Dear Lord, 
 We love You 
 We stand in Your presence now 
 We come into agreement today with Your Kingdom 
 We truly desire to please You in every way 
 And we ask that Your light would come crashing into the darkness 
 Forcing the darkness to move 
 I pray that You would pour out Your love, Your forgiveness, 
 Your kindness, Your power, and Your healing 
 Right now, in the name of Jesus 
 O God, let Your Kingdom come near us today.

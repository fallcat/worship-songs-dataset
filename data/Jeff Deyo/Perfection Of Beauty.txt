Out of nowhere came a Savior 
 Just when all my hope was all but gone 
 Like a rainbow through the shadows 
 Breaking through my sorrow to the dawn 
 Gracious and kind 
 Holy and right 
 God of my life 
 The perfection of beauty, like a wave running through me 
 Like a fire in my bones, like a river of hope 
 The perfection of beauty, with the power to move me 
 Like a flame in the night, like an ocean of light 
 The perfection of beauty 
 In the thunder, there's a fire 
 Who devours all who stand in His way 
 Burning brighter, reaching higher 
 His desire, oh, that all would be saved 
 Gracious and kind 
 Holy and right 
 God of my life 
 The perfection of beauty, like a wave running through me 
 Like a fire in my bones, like a river of hope 
 The perfection of beauty, with the power to move me 
 Like a flame in the night, like an ocean of light 
 The perfection of beauty 
 God will go before us 
 He will make a way 
 God will shine upon us 
 With His face 
 God will go before us 
 He will make a way 
 God will shine upon us 
 With His face 
 Gracious and kind 
 Holy and right 
 God of my life 
 Gracious and kind 
 Holy and right 
 God of my life 
 The perfection of beauty, like a wave running through me 
 Like a fire in my bones, like a river of hope 
 The perfection of beauty, with the power to move me 
 Like a flame in the night, like an ocean of light 
 The perfection of beauty 
 The perfection of beauty 
 The perfection of beauty

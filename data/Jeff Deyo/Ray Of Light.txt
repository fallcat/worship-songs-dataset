There was darkness in my soul 
 Till I turned my heart toward you 
 Now I worship at your feet 
 As I boldly come to your throne 
 To bless your holy name 
 I was empty in my heart 
 Till you filled my with your power 
 Now I praise you more and more 
 Until on that day, with no more wait 
 We'll see you face to face 
 You have become my ray of light 
 When I knew my sun was fading 
 You are the source of all my soul 
 You're the pure fire penetrating 
 You have become my ray of light 
 There was blindness in my eyes 
 Till you touched me with your hand 
 Now a passion burns within 
 To be swept away in your embrace 
 Forever and a day 
 I lift up my heart to you 
 I lift up my hands to you 
 I give all my praise you you 
 I lift up my life to you 
 I lift up this song to you 
 I give all my praise to you

No light to see 
 My heart is pressed inside of me 
 Nowhere to run 
 But straight into unfailing arms 
 Hear me cry, Father 
 Hear me pray, and answer 
 For the glory of Your name 
 Come and rescue me 
 I am on my knees 
 I can barely breathe 
 Come and rescue me, Jesus 
 Be still my soul 
 Until the light comes down the road 
 Be strong, be set 
 Though every hope hangs by a thread 
 Hear me cry, Father 
 Hear me pray, and answer 
 For the glory of Your name 
 Come and rescue me 
 I am on my knees 
 I can barely breathe 
 Come and rescue me, Jesus 
 You will keep me 
 You won't leave me 
 How I need Thee, Lord 
 You will keep me 
 You won't leave me 
 How I need Thee, Lord 
 Come and rescue me 
 I am on my knees 
 I can barely breathe 
 Come and rescue me, Jesus

As I seek you 
 Let me find you 
 As I search for you 
 With all my heart 
 As I praise you 
 Let me know you 
 Let me love your ways 
 And trust your heart 
 Don't let my heart be hardened 
 Don't let my words be insincere 
 Fill me to overflowing 
 As I worship 
 As I glorify your name 
 Won't you make me 
 A sacrifice of praise 
 As I bow down 
 As I magnify your name 
 Won't you make me 
 A sacrifice of praise 
 A sacrifice of praise 
 Don't let my heart deceive me 
 Don't let me turn from your desires 
 Show me the way to freedom 
 Make me an instrument 
 Of pure design 
 Fully obedient 
 Fully refined

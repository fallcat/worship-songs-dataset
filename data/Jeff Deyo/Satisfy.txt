My heart has grown so cold 
 I've let the darkness in 
 I've said You were everything 
 But still You weren't enough 
 I've not been true to You 
 My life has hurt You, Lord 
 But I'm running back into 
 The safety of Your hand 
 I wanna be free, Jesus 
 I wanna be satisfied 
 In You and You alone 
 Take this heart, take my life 
 Pull me close, satisfy 
 My heart has heard Your call 
 But I have closed my ears 
 I've said I would follow You 
 But still I've chased the wind 
 I've stretched my hand towards You 
 While holding to this world 
 But now I'm letting go 
 And reaching out to You 
 I wanna be free, Jesus 
 I wanna be satisfied 
 In You and You alone 
 Take this heart, take my life 
 Pull me close, oh 
 I wanna be free, Jesus 
 I wanna be satisfied 
 In You and You alone 
 Take this heart, take my life 
 Pull me close, satisfy 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free, oh 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free, oh, oh 
 I wanna be free, Jesus 
 I wanna be satisfied 
 In You and You alone 
 Take this heart, take my life 
 Pull me close, oh 
 I wanna be free, Jesus 
 I wanna be satisfied 
 In You and You alone 
 Take this heart, take my life 
 Pull me close, satisfy, oh 
 I'm letting go, I'm letting go, Jesus 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free, oh, oh 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free, oh, oh 
 I wanna be free, oh 
 I wanna be free

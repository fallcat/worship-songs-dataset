Today we come to God 
 Where saints and angels trod 
 And Jesus is the light 
 So let us run the race 
 With power and in faith 
 Redeemed and purified 
 For we know, You, O God 
 Are the All Consuming Fire 
 Come and shake, shake this place 
 Break away these chains, so only truth remains 
 Come and shake, shake this place 
 'Cause we want You to reign for the glory of Your name 
 Shake this place 
 The Kingdom we receive is for eternity 
 And will not be denied 
 So let us live for God with holy fear and awe 
 With joy before our eyes 
 Haste the day when the earth 
 Shakes and trembles at Your name 
 Come and shake, shake this place 
 Break away these chains, so only truth remains 
 Come and shake, shake this place 
 'Cause we want You to reign for the glory of Your name 
 Shake this place 
 Shake this place 
 Shake everything that can be shaken 
 Awake everything that can be awakened 
 Shake everything that can be shaken 
 Awake everything that can be awakened 
 Shake everything that can be shaken 
 Awake everything that can be awakened 
 Shake everything that can be shaken 
 Awake everything that can be awakened 
 Come and shake, shake this place 
 Break away these chains, so only truth remains 
 Come and shake, shake this place 
 'Cause we want You to reign for the glory of Your name 
 Shake this place 
 Shake this place

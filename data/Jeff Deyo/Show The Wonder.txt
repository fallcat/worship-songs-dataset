What I want is to be known by you, Lord 
 To be famous in your eyes 
 I don't care if the world knows my name 
 For it's you I long to please 
 To please you 
 To honor you 
 This one thing I desire 
 Show the wonder of your love 
 Give me all that I can take 
 Show your power in my heart 
 Make me the apple of your eye 
 Show me you 
 What I want is to be rich in your love 
 To be jaded with your ways 
 I could gain all the wealth in the world 
 But it can't compare to you 
 There's nothing 
 There's no one 
 To take the place of you

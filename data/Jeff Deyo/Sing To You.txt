 Spoken to the end of the track: 
 I think this is going to be one of the most important things that we do 
 For, all, all of you guys know we're getting ready to go to the studio tomorrow 
 And, um, it's something that, um, I've definitely been longing to do, 
 For the last at least two years, go back in and record again, but uh, 
 So this morning, I just want us to get together for a few minutes, 
 The desire of my heart is that this album 
 That we're going to start tomorrow would be something that would really touch the heart of God, 
 And that, uh, would have His absolute blessing and anointing, and uh, 
 I don't even know why we did this prayer thing last time, 
 I mean I don't know why we were inspired to do it, 
 I think it is a really cool thing we did it three years ago when we did the first SonicFlood album. 
 Uh, I think God led us to have that time, uh, 
 We had no clue what we were doing; we had no idea what we were getting into, 
 We didn't even know if we'd do another album. 
 We've been through a lot since that time. 
 God, I think for me, has, in just thinking about the last few weeks, and getting ready to do this album again, 
 You know, the Lord is really shown me over the last three years  what my calling is, uh, which is very, very exciting. Uh. 
 It's really a great thing to be able to be walking in that, uh, before SonicFlood, before worship, for me, 
 You know it, I'm just thankful, I guess today I'm just thankful.  I'm just thankful. 
 Then David prayed a prayer.  I think it can be our prayer this morning: 
 “Praise be to you, O Lord, 
 God of our father Israel, 
 From everlasting to everlasting. 
 Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power 
 And the glory and the majesty and the splendor, 
 For everything in heaven and earth is yours. 
 Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom; 
 You are exalted as head over all. 
 Wealth and honor come from you; 
 You are the ruler of all things. 
 In your hands are strength and power 
 To exalt and give strength to all. 
 Now, our God, we give you thanks, 
 And praise your glorious name." 
 Father, that's really what we're here to do today. 
 To take all that these men are bringing to You, and to place them at Your feet, 
 And to say, "God, take them, use them, bless them." 
 David also said to Solomon: 
 “Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work is finished. " 
 Thank You, Father. 
 This is a day of dedication and sanctification, Lord. 
 For this project is a tool; it's a weapon. 
 It will pull the strongholds down and it will release captives. 
 It will set those who are in bondage free. 
 We say, in Jesus' name, that blind eyes will open. 
 Even demons tremble at the sound of Your words, sung and released through the hearts of these, Your servants. 
 Let this be a day of holy sanctification for that which You're doing. 
 There needs to be a fresh flow; a fresh anointing, that will flow through, 
 Just like a river, Lord, unhindered by anything, and unstopped, Lord, so it would be build, and it would crescendo, Lord, and it would just pour out and accomplish all that You have intended. 
 And so I pray this river become a flood, in Jesus' name, truly become a mighty ocean, O God, 
 That will cover the world. 
 So that there's not any man or woman that does not know that You are the God, 
 That every knee will bow, every tongue will confess that You are the Lord. 
 This is a part of this plan that You have. 
 A part, O God, that we say yes and amen to.  In Jesus' name.  Yes, Lord.

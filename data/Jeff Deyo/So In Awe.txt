Stronger than any other 
 Louder than any thunder 
 Bigger than any wonder 
 Greater than any power 
 Finer than any flower 
 Higher than any tower 
 Here we are now 
 So in awe of You 
 So in awe of You 
 We stand in awe of You 
 Forever, Maker 
 So in awe of You 
 So in awe of You 
 We stand in awe of You 
 Forever, Savior 
 Together we will seek You 
 Forever we will praise You 
 You are the Father of our hearts 
 Never ceasing to love You 
 Never forgetting Your truth 
 You are the Father of our hearts 
 Here we are now 
 Set apart now 
 So in awe of You 
 Here we are now 
 Set on fire now 
 So in awe of You

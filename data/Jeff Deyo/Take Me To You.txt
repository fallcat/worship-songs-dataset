How long must we wait 
 To see your face 
 How long must we stand here 
 Calling out for you 
 How far is heaven 
 From the earth 
 How far is the distance 
 From my heart to yours 
 Right now, take me away from here 
 Away from the cares of this world 
 Right here, come sweep me off my feet 
 Into your open arms 
 Take me to you, Lord 
 Take me to you, Lord 
 Take me, take me 
 Take me to you, Lord 
 How loud must we cry 
 For you to come 
 How still must we be 
 To know your presence

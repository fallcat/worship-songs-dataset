You have captured me 
 More than life, itself, You move me 
 How I long to bow 
 At the feet of the One who saves me 
 Jesus, thank You for the cross 
 Savior, the One who sets me free 
 Jesus, thank You for Your blood 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Thank You for life 
 Thank You for life, oh 
 You stole heaven's heart 
 In Your pain You pleased Your Father 
 Angels stood in awe 
 While You carried the shame meant for me, oh 
 Jesus, thank You for the cross 
 Savior, the One who sets me free 
 Jesus, thank You for Your blood 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Thank You for life, oh 
 There is nothing greater You have done 
 Than to lose Your life to gain my soul 
 There is nothing that compares to this 
 No nothing, no nothing 
 Jesus, Savior, Redeemer 
 Thank You for life ohâ€¦ 
 Jesus, thank You for the cross 
 Savior, the One who sets me free 
 Jesus, thank You for Your blood 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Thank You for life, oh 
 Jesus, thank You for the cross 
 Savior, the One who sets me free 
 Jesus, thank You for Your blood 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Thank You for life 
 Thank You for life 
 Thank You for life, oh, oh 
 Thank You, Thank You for life

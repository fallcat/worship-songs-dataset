The sun and moon and every star 
 Are there to show me who You are 
 I can be sure your fingerprints 
 Are everywhere 
 My every move, my every breath 
 Were meant to point to your greatness 
 There's nothing made that was not made 
 To show Your power 
 These hands were made to praise You 
 These lips were made to lift You up 
 I give to You my life in worship 
 These feet were made to serve You 
 This tongue, to sing of Your great love 
 I give to You my life in worship 
 A tender thought, a caring deed 
 A gift of love to one in need 
 Bringing honest acts of worship to You, Lord 
 Lifting holy hands in worship to You, Lord 
 God, receive this humble sacrifice of praise

I know as I envision 
 Your never ending power 
 Your splendor is more 
 Than I can imagine 
 I've heard of Your perfections 
 But I've been blind to You 
 Open my eyes 
 Open my ears 
 Open my heart 
 Unveil my eyes 
 So I can see Your glory 
 Unveil my eyes 
 So I can know You're here 
 You're here 
 Your love, it overtakes me 
 And makes me who I am 
 As I am undone 
 In light of Your glory 
 Take apart this world 
 That I have made 
 Make this heart aware 
 Of more than me 
 Reveal to me the depths 
 Of who You are 
 And come and teach me like a child 
 To trust Your heart

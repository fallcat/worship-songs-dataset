We come to your throne with weeping 
 We come to your throne with sorrow and shame 
 We come to your throne with weeping 
 We come 
 We come to your throne with mourning 
 We come to your throne with desperate hearts 
 We come to your throne with mourning 
 We come 
 We come to you 
 We cry out for mercy 
 And we turn from our sins 
 We come to you 
 Humble and broken 
 We fall on our knees 
 We come to you 
 We come 
 We come to your throne forgiven 
 We come to your throne by the blood of the Lamb 
 We come to your throne forgiven 
 We come 
 We come to you 
 We thank you for mercy 
 And the freedom to live 
 We coem to you 
 Singing and shouting 
 We come to you 
 We come

I wake to see the sun rise from her slumber 
 I hear the birds sing their songs of love 
 A knowing smile warms my face, I remember 
 To be thankful, it's a beautiful day 
 My lost and lonely heart was calling 
 Out to find the way 
 Then I found You, wonderful You 
 Like a dream You came, let me live again 
 Oh, now there's You, glorious You 
 I need forever to know You way 
 There was a time when peace of mind just eluded me 
 And the sun was always clouded from my view 
 Oh, You opened up my heart to see a new day 
 Now this fire within me needs to praise 
 I once was lost, but then You found me 
 I'm in Your arms to stay 
 How I love You, wonderful You 
 Like a dream You came, let me live again 
 Oh, now there's You, beautiful You 
 I need forever to know You way 
 Take my hand 
 Show me the Word 
 Change my heart 
 Oh, let it be true 
 Take my hand 
 Show me the Word 
 Change my heart 
 Oh, let it be true 
 My lost and lonely heart was calling 
 Out to find the way 
 Oh, I once was lost, and then You found me 
 I'm in Your arms to stay 
 Now I've got You, wonderful You 
 Like a dream You came, let me live again 
 Oh, now there's You, glorious You 
 I need forever to know You way 
 How I love You, wonderful You 
 Like a dream You came, let me live again 
 Oh, I love You, beautiful You 
 I need forever to know You way

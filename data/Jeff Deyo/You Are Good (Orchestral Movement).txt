Spoken: 
 I, I remember sitting for at a Billy Graham crusade 
 Hearing George Beverly sing the song "I'd Rather Have Jesus" 
 And it struck me so powerful that night 
 Even though I'd heard that song many times before 
 I realized that it was a powerful song that transcends time 
 Even though it was written years ago 
 I justâ€¦I just have this sense that it was something 
 That really will speak to this generation 
 Almost be a heart cry for this generation 
 So, Lord, I just pray that You would make this song our desire 
 I'd rather have Jesus than anything 
 Take away our passion for the things of this world 
 Diminish them, Lord, and increase our desire and our appetite for the things of God, 
 For the things of Your Spirit

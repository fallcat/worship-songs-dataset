I will fight 'til the end 
 Doesn't matter what the world brings against me 
 I will fight 'til the end 
 Doesn't matter what people say 
 I will love 'til the end 
 Even as the love grows colder 
 I will hope 'til the end 
 Even if everything seems hopeless 
 You go before me 
 Every step I take 
 Need nothing more 
 I will not be afraid 
 King over everything 
 And death has lost its sting 
 You're alive in me 
 Yours is the victory 
 I will trust 'til the end 
 Even if fear's all around me 
 I will pray 'til the end 
 It's where I find my strength 
 I will serve 'til the end 
 Showing Christ to the broken, hurting 
 I will stand 'til the end 
 Even if I'm the last one standing 
 I believe in the one true King 
 I believe in Your love unending 
 I believe that You bled for me 
 'Cause I believe that the cross is everything

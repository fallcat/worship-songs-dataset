With every moment of every day 
 My heart is aching with words to say 
 I can't explain it, the way I feel 
 All that you've given has been so real 
 I couldn't breathe some, I couldn't breathe 
 Something more to live 
 I didn't want none I didn't want 
 Nothing more than this. 
 All the time, all the time 
 You have given me love more than I know 
 All the time, all the time 
 You have given me love more than I know 
 My words are wasted when I don't speak 
 Of all your wonders within our reach 
 The more you show me your printed hands 
 To be more grateful, to understand 
 I couldn't breathe some, I couldn't breathe 
 Something more to live 
 I didn't want none I didn't want 
 None, nothing more than this. 
 All the time, all the time 
 You have given me love more than I know 
 All the time, all the time 
 You have given me love more than I know 
 The way you've planned it, it's more than I can see 
 I'll never understand it until I live with you in eternity 
 All the time, all the time 
 You have given me love more than I know 
 All the time, all the time 
 You have given me love more than I know

Lord help me now to face this battle 
 My strength has failed and my eyes can't see 
 Through the waves of doubt that take me under 
 In the chaos I hear you speak 
 Be still and know that You are my God 
 Be still and know that You are enough 
 Though my heart is racing still You're in control 
 Be still and know that You are my God 
 You brought me rest in times of struggle 
 I lay my head down at Your feet 
 The storm in me that I can't wrestle 
 Is calmed when I hear you speak 
 You are faithful 
 And Your love endures forever 
 Yes, Your love endures forever 
 You are able 
 In You I'll stand forever 
 Yes, in You I'll stand forever

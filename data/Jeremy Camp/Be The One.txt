And all these dreams I've made I take them all and lay them down in light of reasons I have found now 
 And I can rest in knowing You will open every door instead of forcing my own world now 
 I'd rather wait on You 
 You'll be the one to call me out 
 I have found that it's the only way 
 You'll be the one to call me out 
 I have found that it's the only way 
 I know that I have plans but You will take me every step 
 You have covered all my debt now 
 And I have realized these empty fames that people crave are based on hopes of what they've made now 
 I'd rather wait on You 
 You'll be the one to call me out 
 I have found that it's the only way 
 You'll be the one to call me out 
 I have found that it's the only way 
 Well there's more than what I'm feeling, well there's more than what I'm feeling 
 You'll be the one to call me out 
 I have found that it's the only way 
 You'll be the one to call me out 
 I have found that it's the only way

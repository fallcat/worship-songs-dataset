As I sit here looking at this world 
 I see no hope, no sense of care 
 We're to caught up in the things of 
 This day, not thinking about the end 
 It's right around the way 
 I know it's hard with that new age idea 
 But put your faith in 
 God and everything will come clear 
 Take a look at yourself are you 
 Really doing fine or are you caught 
 Up in a trap doing time? 
 Why don't you believe in Jesus 
 Why don't you put your faith in Him 
 Why don't you believe in Jesus 
 Why don't you put your trust in Him 
 The circumstance is very clear 
 How morale has come undone 
 The only hope is Jesus 
 The Father's only son 
 The time is drawing near 
 For all men to decide 
 So put your doubts and swallow your pride 
 Why don't you believe in Jesus 
 Why don't you put your faith in Him 
 Why don't you believe in Jesus 
 Why don't you put your trust in Him 
 Why don't you, Why don't you, Why don't you 
 Why don't you believe in Jesus 
 Why don't you put your faith in Him 
 Why don't you believe in Jesus 
 Why don't you put your trust in Him

The fog has finally cleared to see, 
 The beautiful life You've given me. 
 To feel the breeze of my newborn's gentle breath. 
 With one to walk hand in hand, 
 To share this life that You have planned. 
 It's like a storybook with dreams 
 That are meant to see. 
 Every next step is an extraordinary scene. 
 I know that I've been 
 Given more than beyond measure. 
 I come alive when 
 I see beyond my fears. 
 I know that I've been given more than earthly treasures. 
 I come alive when 
 I've broken down and given You control. 
 I've faced a great tragedy, 
 But have seen the works of what You bring. 
 A display of faith that You give. 
 I don't know if I will ever understand 
 The depth of what it is You've done inside, 
 But I know I won't find any worth apart from You. 
 I know that I've been 
 Given more than beyond measure. 
 I come alive when 
 I see beyond my fears. 
 I know that I've been given more than earthly treasures. 
 I come alive when 
 I've broken down and given You control. 
 Everything that I have 
 Has been given so unselfishly 
 And shown that even when I don't deserve, 
 You always show the fullness of Your love. 
 I know that I've been 
 Given more than beyond measure. 
 I come alive when 
 I see beyond my fears. 
 I know that I've been given more than earthly treasures. 
 I come alive when 
 I've broken down and given You control. 
 When I've broken down and given You control. 
 When I've broken down and given You control.

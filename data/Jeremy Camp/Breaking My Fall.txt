So easily I fall, so easily you reach your hand out, 
 Quickly will I drown, Know the pulls of all my reason, 
 So easily will I feel, so easily will your peace surpass me, 
 Quickly will I trust in anything I think is worthy, 
 How many times you make the waves calm down, 
 So I won't be afraid now? 
 I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall, 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall, 
 What am I suppose to do? 
 (What am I suppose to do?) 
 How precious are your thoughts? 
 (How precious are your thoughts?) 
 And how many of them, you think about me, 
 Faithful are your ways, 
 I always feel your grace abound me, 
 Quickly will I call, 
 Quickly will you answer my cry, 
 Carefully will you bring, everything I need in my life, 
 How many of times you make the waves calm down, 
 So I won't be afraid now? 
 I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall, 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall, 
 What am I suppose to do? 
 (What am I suppose to do?) 
 This narrow road I'm walking, 
 This world tries to draw, 
 Whoever will help me fight it, 
 But you won't face it all, 
 I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall, 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall, 
 What am I suppose to do? 
 (What am I suppose to do?)

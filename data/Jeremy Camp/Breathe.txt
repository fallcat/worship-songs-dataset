You fill my empty soul 
 I'll give You all control 
 You take this heart of mine and make the pieces whole 
 You broke this fear inside 
 I'll leave these cares behind 
 You take this simple mold and sanctify my mind 
 You formed me before I was known 
 I was made Your own now 
 Breathe in me 
 Breathe the breath of life it's more than I can see, yeah 
 Oh, Breathe in me 
 Breathe the breath of life 
 It's more than I can see, yeah 
 You took on everything to make me feel complete 
 You answered every call 
 You're never far from reach 
 You lift me when I fall 
 You break down every wall 
 You feel my every need I dedicate my all 
 You took this failed attempt to stand and You carry me now 
 Breathe in me 
 Breathe the breath of life it's more than I can see, yeah 
 Oh, Breathe in me 
 Breathe the breath of life 
 It's more than I can see, yeah 
 I won't hesitate to call when I'm empty from within and I know the only source of life are the very words You give 
 You formed me before I was known and I was made Your own now 
 Breathe in me 
 Breathe the breath of life it's more than I can see, yeah 
 Oh, Breathe in me 
 Breathe the breath of life 
 It's more than I can see, yeah 
 Breathe in me 
 Breathe in me

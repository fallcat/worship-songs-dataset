All the people that I see 
 How they search so desperately 
 All I want, all I need, is for You to give to me 
 A heart for those who need to know how much You care 
 I can see your burden coming everyday, searching for the answer 
 I just need You to 
 Burden me with the weight that You love me 
 Burden me with Your plan 
 Burden me with the message that You've given me 
 Burden me here I am 
 Well the purpose within me 
 How it burns so fervently 
 All I want, all I need, is for you to give to me 
 A heart for those who need to know how much You care 
 I can see your burden coming everyday, searching for the answer 
 And I just need you to 
 Burden me with the weight that You love me 
 Burden me with your plan 
 Burden me with the message that You've given me 
 Burden me here I am 
 Burden me with the weight that You love me 
 Burden me with Your plan 
 Burden me with the message that You've given me 
 Burden me here I am 
 Oh 
 Burden me with the weight that You love me 
 Burden me with Your plan 
 Burden me with the message that You've given me 
 Burden me here I am 
 Oh 
 Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I am 
 Here I am, here I am, here I am 
 Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I am 
 Here I am, here I am, here I am 
 Burden me with the weight that You love me 
 Burden me here I am

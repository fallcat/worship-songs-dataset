I can't lean on the earthly things 
 'Cause it's broke and gonna fade 
 And I can't stand on the dirt below 
 'Cause this dust gonna blow away 
 You say, hey now, follow Me, gonna go to the promise land 
 You say, hey child, don't forget that the Lord is coming back 
 When everything in this world is falling 
 We have a Kingdom that can't be moved 
 People get ready Heaven is a calling 
 We have a Kingdom that can't be, that can't be moved 
 When the waters rise, don't be surprised 
 When the force tries to pull you in 
 We'll be found on the solid ground 
 Won't be no slave to sin 
 You say, hey now, trumpet sound, all the saints gonna board the train 
 You say, hey child, don't you fear, what's dead's gonna rise again 
 Truth be told, silver and gold ain't where my treasure's found 
 So when I die, gonna open my eyes with a different kind of crown

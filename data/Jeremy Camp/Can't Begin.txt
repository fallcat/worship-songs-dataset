I've broken everything I've touched. 
 I've even spoken way too much. 
 No matter what I find, 
 Reflect this light You shine 
 In every part of me. 
 I can't begin 
 To even thank You for the life that You have lived. 
 I can't pretend to even understand the fullness of Your plan. 
 So I'll just keep on giving all I can 
 I worry more sometimes than trust. 
 I'm grateful for Your patient touch. 
 I'm finally waking up to see You holding me. 
 Oh 
 Every single time, 
 I can't begin 
 To even thank You for the life that You have lived. 
 I can't pretend to even understand the fullness of Your plan. 
 So I'll just keep on giving all I can 
 I go back to the simple things. 
 To trust in every word You bring, 
 I know that You have everything 
 All I've left is laying at Your feet. 
 I'm waiting at Your feet now. 
 I can't begin 
 To even thank You for the life that You have lived. 
 I can't pretend to even understand the fullness of Your plan. 
 So I'll just keep on giving all I can 
 I can't begin 
 I can't begin

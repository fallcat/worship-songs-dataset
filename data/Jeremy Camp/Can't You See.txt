If He knows every sparrow 
 That falls from above 
 Then how much more will 
 He give you and I his love 
 To be called into His Hand 
 And been given all you have 
 A hope that is eternal 
 And a future we can grab 
 And all that I can see 
 Is what His love has done for me 
 Can't you see what it means to be 
 The child of One who set you free 
 Can't you see what it means to be 
 The child of One who delivered me 
 You want to have a 
 Purpose just like everyone 
 You'll be a slave to the world's 
 Choices and not to His Son 
 The thought if being called 
 Out by our very own name 
 It's better than all the glory and 
 Better than all the fame 
 And all that I can see 
 Is what His love has done for me

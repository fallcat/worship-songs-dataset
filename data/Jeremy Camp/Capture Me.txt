You search inside the deepest parts 
 You radiate the darkness in my heart 
 Oh, I can't hide no more 
 You took this life that once was frail, and give a strength where hopelessness won't prevail 
 And there's life more abundantly 
 Your beauty Lord, I know it captures me 
 Your sweet embrace, it brings me to my knees 
 Oh, You capture me, oh Lord, You capture me 
 You opened up my heart and made a home in me 
 You lifted up the weight the world has placed on me 
 Oh, You capture me, oh Lord, You capture me 
 You brought me joy that words can't speak 
 You gave a truth where lies will never reach, oh 
 I won't fight no more 
 You gave me peace from this life of fear 
 Never alone, at every grasp You were near 
 Now there's life more abundantly, oh 
 Your beauty Lord, I know it captures me 
 Your sweet embrace, it brings me to my knees 
 Oh, You capture me, oh Lord, You capture me 
 You opened up my heart and made a home in me 
 You lifted up the weight the world has placed on me 
 Oh, You capture me, oh Lord, You capture me 
 And I can feel Your touch, I can feel Your heart 
 And Your fullness flowing over 
 Your waves of mercy over me 
 Your beauty Lord, I know it captures me 
 Your sweet embrace, it brings me to my knees 
 Oh, the love You show it pours all over me 
 Oh, You capture me, oh Lord, You capture me 
 You opened up my heart and make a home in me 
 You lifted up the weight the world has placed on me 
 Oh, You capture me, oh Lord, You capture me now 
 I can feel Your touch 
 I can feel Your heart 
 All Your beauty Lord, it captures me 
 I can feel Your touch 
 All Your beauty, Lord 
 All Your beauty, Lord 
 Oh, it captures me

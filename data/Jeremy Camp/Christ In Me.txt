In this obsession with the things this world says make us happy 
 Can't see the slaves we are in all the searching all the grasping 
 Like we deserve much more than all these blessing we're holding 
 So now I'm running free into an ocean of mercy unending 
 So come and empty me 
 So that it's you I breathe 
 I want my life to be 
 Only Christ in me 
 So I will fix my eyes 
 'Cause you're my source of life 
 I need the world to see 
 That it's Christ in me 
 That it's Christ in me 
 Done with what holds me down the things I once was chasing after 
 Throw off these heavy chains that I have let become my master 
 So now I'm running free into an ocean of mercy unending 
 So come and empty me 
 So that it's you I breathe 
 I want my life to be 
 Only Christ in me 
 So I will fix my eyes 
 'Cause you're my source of life 
 I need the world to see 
 That it's Christ in me 
 That it's Christ in me 
 In this obsession with the things this world says make us happy 
 Can't see the slaves we are in all the searching all the grasping

 So I will fix my eyes 
 'Cause you're my source of life

 Only Christ in me 
 Only Christ in me 
 Only Christ in me 
 Christ in me

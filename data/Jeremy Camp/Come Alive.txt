As I watch the world being held captive by dreams 
 That will never be fulfilled in this life 
 Chasing the darkness and everything that surrounds 
 All the emptiness buried inside 
 Well I won't stop showing this hope that is holding 
 The passion so deep in my heart 
 To tell all the world of Your love and affection 
 And the plan that You've had from the start 
 So I will continue to fight 
 'Til the world comes alive 
 'Til the world comes alive 
 Cause You have restored us 
 And You have redeemed us 
 And we have been given new life 
 Cause You are alive 
 There is a freedom that begins by receiving 
 The forgiveness that cleanses us all 
 All the broken and bleeding just start by believing 
 His love has conquered death's call 
 So I will continue to fight 
 'Til the world comes alive 
 'Til the world comes alive 
 Cause You have restored us 
 And You have redeemed us 
 And we have been given new life 
 Cause You are alive 
 I walk out on the battlefield 
 See that all the pain is real 
 Be the hands that stop the bleeding 
 Seeing all these wounded souls 
 All they really need is hope 
 I'll show Your great love is healing 
 'Til the world comes alive 
 'Til the world comes alive 
 'Til the world comes alive 
 Cause You have restored us 
 And You have redeemed us 
 And we have been given new life 
 Cause You are alive 
 And You are alive 
 You are alive 
 You are alive 
 As I watch the world being held captive by dreams 
 That will never be fulfilled in this life

You are my supply 
 My breath of life 
 Still more awesome than I know 
 You are my reward 
 Worth living for 
 Still more awesome than I know 
 And all of You 
 Is more than enough for all of me 
 For every thirst and every need 
 You satisfy me with Your love 
 And all I have in You is more than enough 
 You're my sacrifice 
 Of greatest price 
 Still more awesome than I know 
 You're my coming King 
 You're my everything 
 Still more awesome than I know 
 And all of You 
 Is more than enough for all of me 
 For every thirst and every need 
 You satisfy me with Your love 
 And all I have in You is more than enough 
 You are more than enough 
 More than all I want 
 More than all I need 
 You are more than enough for me 
 More than all I know 
 More than I can see 
 You are more than enough for me 
 More than all I want 
 More than all I need 
 You are more than enough for me 
 More than all I know 
 More than all I can see 
 You are more than enough 
 All of You 
 Is more than enough for all of me 
 For every thirst and every need 
 You satisfy me with Your love 
 And all I have in You, oh yeah 
 And all I have in You, Jesus 
 And all I have in You is more than enough 
 More than enough

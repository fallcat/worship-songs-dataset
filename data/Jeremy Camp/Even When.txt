You know and You see the times of my defeat 
 When I fail to realize Your kindness reaches 
 Through all my fragile fears of wasting any years 
 I see You go beyond my silent feelings 
 Even when I wrote my life away 
 You still receive me 
 Even when I wrote my life away 
 You still receive me, oh yeah 
 You took this fading heart and softened every part 
 I'll rest in light of what You've promised to me 
 Even when I wrote my life away 
 You still receive me 
 Even when I wrote my life away 
 You still receive me, oh yeah 
 I'll always stay strong because I feel You holding on now 
 To You I belong and I know 
 And You heal me... 
 And You heal me… 
 And You heal me… 
 Even when I wrote my life away 
 You still receive me 
 Even when I wrote my life away 
 You still receive me, You still receive me 
 You still receive me 
 Even when I wrote my life away 
 You still receive me, oh yeah 
 'Cause I can feel Your full arms around me 
 And I know that I'll never escape from You

And I tried to find anything I could 
 To fill the void that I had felt inside, 
 And I tried to hide because I never could 
 Release the very guilt that was in my mind, 
 Every time that I'd trace these lines, 
 I'd feel like I had been so blind cause. 
 You are everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I breathe for, 
 And everything that this heart will need, yeah 
 Everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I crave. 
 Sometimes I feel a fight to release the grip 
 And trust that everything will be all right. 
 And it's been so real to feel the peace that You give 
 Start unfolding when I let things go, 
 Every weight that I build inside, 
 When I lay it down I realize that. 
 You are everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I breathe for, 
 And everything that this heart will need, yeah 
 Everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I crave. 
 All these pointless ties to these endless lies 
 That this temporal life will satisfy, 
 Well, I hide my life in You. 
 You're everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I breathe for, 
 You're everything that this heart will need 
 You're everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I crave. 
 Everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I breathe for, 
 And everything that this heart will need, yeah 
 You are everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I crave. 
 Everything that I hope for, 
 And everything that I breathe for, 
 And everything that this heart will need, yeah 
 Everything that I hope for

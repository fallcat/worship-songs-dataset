I spin around 
 I can hardly see 
 To catch a glimpse of this moment 
 I hear the sounds of this simple plea 
 To wait at the feet of Your love 
 Everytime I'm on my knees pleading for Your strength I will find You there, find You there 
 Everytime I'm on my knees reaching for Your strength I will find You there, find You there 
 To feel the crown of the One I have breathed for 
 To know the door 
 It will never be broken 
 Because I have found that time this time has no hold on the rate that I need You 
 And I know it's never hard to find You 
 Everytime I'm on my knees pleading for Your strength I will find You there, find You there 
 Everytime I'm on my knees reaching for Your strength I will find You there, find You there 
 I'm holding on to this hope I've been given 
 To be always with You 
 I'm seeing now that this fullness of faith is always seeking You, yeah 
 Everytime I'm on my knees pleading for Your strength I will find You there, find You there 
 Everytime I'm on my knees reaching for Your strength I will find You there, find You there 
 I will find You 
 I will find You there

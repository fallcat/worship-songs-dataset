I fail in every single way 
 But every time I hear You say, 
 "Faithful one, come into this place, 
 The place of rest where you belong." 
 Anticipate the final day when 
 I fall into Your warm embrace. 
 With everything that I've been through, 
 Nothing else compares. 
 And it feels like 
 All these tears are coming through, 
 When I think of all You do. 
 And it feels like all this joy is bleeding through, 
 When I think of seeing You, yeah. 
 I complicate this very state of resting in what You create. 
 Nothing goes out Your control, 
 You've given me this very soul. 
 You cared enough to take my place, 
 And given me unending grace. 
 I know that You know every need that's my security. 
 And it feels like 
 All these tears are coming through, 
 When I think of all You do. 
 And it feels like all this joy is bleeding through, 
 When I think of seeing You, yeah. 
 All Your ways are so mysterious. 
 And never far, Your ear to hear us. 
 I'll never thirst from this drink that You give, oh. 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like

I will be dancing free 
 Unashamed before my King 
 When I am finally home 
 Won't need no bed to sleep 
 I have too much to see 
 Just staring at Your throne 
 Eyes will fill with tears of joy 
 Your fullness, I will know 
 I will be forever running free 
 Moving to all Heaven's melodies 
 Colors that I've never seen 
 Bigger than my wildest dreams 
 We'll be together 
 When I'm finally home 
 Head first into Your love 
 I'll never get enough of 
 What You have to show 
 And that's just the beginning 
 In Your river I'll be swimming 
 And the waters never cold 
 Every tribe and every nation 
 Shouting out Your name 
 You and I will be together 
 With a love that lasts forever 
 And I know there's nothing better 
 We will be forever running free

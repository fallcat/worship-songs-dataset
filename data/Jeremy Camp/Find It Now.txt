You spoke to soon 
 But the words you said 
 I still use for good 
 The mistakes you made 
 I bring it back to my glory 
 So find it now, find it now 
 The faith that you once kept 
 Hold on to the words that I spoke 
 Discouragement sets in 
 Because you feel like nothing's 
 Going the way that you planned 
 Well don't trust in yourself 
 And remember that I hold 
 You in my hands 
 So find it now, find it now 
 The faith that you once kept 
 Hold on to the words that I spoke 
 So find it now, find it now 
 The faith that you once kept 
 Hold on to the words that I spoke 
 The trials that you're going through 
 Remember My faithfulness to you 
 My faithfulness to you 
 Even when all hope if through 
 You will find it's not the end of road 
 In all your tribulations, stand strong 
 And find you rest in Me 
 So find it now, find it now 
 The faith that you once kept 
 Hold on to the words that I spoke

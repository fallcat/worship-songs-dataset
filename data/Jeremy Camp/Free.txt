The day I stopped and listened 
 Heard the sound of love 
 Asking to be let in 
 Offering a new life 
 And giving me a chance 
 To start over again 
 You reached out to me 
 And now I sing 
 And I am free 
 And I am free 
 My sin was wrapped around me 
 Trying to drown me 
 You have set me free 
 And I am free 
 And I am free 
 The chains that held me tightly 
 Are finally lifting 
 You took this weight from me 
 Now I'm free 
 Covered by Your mercy 
 Captured by a hope that will always remain 
 I can stop and breathe now 
 Resting in the shelter of Your name 
 You reached out to me 
 And now I sing 
 And I am free 
 And I am free 
 My sin was wrapped around me 
 Trying to drown me 
 You have set me free 
 And I am free 
 And I am free 
 The chains that held me tightly 
 Are finally lifting 
 You took this weight from me 
 No more fear inside me 
 I will trust completely 
 Your love overtakes me 
 And nothing else has made me free 
 I am free 
 Free 
 And I am free 
 My sin was wrapped around me 
 Trying to drown me 
 You have set me free 
 And I am free 
 And I am free 
 The chains that held me tightly 
 Are finally lifting 
 You took this weight from me 
 And now I'm free 
 The chains that held me tightly 
 Are finally lifting 
 You took this weight from me 
 And now I'm free

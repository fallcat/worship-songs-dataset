I felt like I was spinning. 
 Didn't know what was up from down. 
 I tried to fix what I had broken. 
 It was scattered all around. 
 It seems that every time I try walking by myself, 
 I end up on my face with nowhere else to go. 
 So I surrender all my ways. 
 Take all of these impurities. 
 I'm giving You this wretched soul. 
 I'm giving You these insecurities… 
 Giving You all control. 
 I'm placing both my feet on the floor. 
 Making sure I won't make that mistake anymore. 
 I've tasted all the emptiness around me, 
 And I'm never going back. 
 I'd set myself up for the lies that this world satisfies, 
 But You're all that I need. 
 And I have peace inside. 
 So keep tearing out all of my pride. 
 Take all of these impurities. 
 I'm giving You this wretched soul. 
 I'm giving You these insecurities… 
 Giving You all control.  (All control…) 
 I'm taking all my fears and layin' em at Your feet now. 
 I'm resting in the fact that everything is safe now, 
 When I let go of all the things I know will fade out. 
 Every word that You have said I know I'll never doubt. 
 Never doubt 
 Never doubt 
 Never doubt 
 Never doubt 
 Take all of these impurities. 
 I'm giving You this wretched soul. 
 I'm giving You these insecurities… 
 Giving You all control.  (All control…)

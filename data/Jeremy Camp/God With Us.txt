Hallelujah, the King has come 
 Beautiful Savior, God's own Son 
 Hallelujah, the Christ is here 
 So rejoice, for our salvation's near 
 Emmanuel, our humble King 
 We give You our hearts as an offering 
 You laid down Your crown and became as dust 
 Emmanuel, God With Us 
 Hallelujah, the Angels sing 
 To certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay 
 Hallelujah, the world will see 
 The fullness of His majesty 
 Emmanuel, our humble King 
 We give You our hearts as an offering 
 You laid down Your crown and became as dust 
 Emmanuel, God With Us 
 O Come, all ye faithful, our God is here 
 Joyful triumphant, salvation's near 
 O come and behold our King 
 Come and behold Him 
 Emmanuel, our humble King 
 We give You our hearts as an offering 
 You laid down Your crown and became as dust 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel, God With Us

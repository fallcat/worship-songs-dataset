All the bitter weary ways 
 Endless striving day by day 
 You barely have the strength to pray 
 In the valley low 
 How hard your fight has been 
 How deep the pain within 
 Wounds that no one else has seen 
 Hurts too much to show 
 All the doubt you're standing in between 
 And all the weight that brings you to your knees 
 He knows, He knows 
 Every hurt and every sting 
 He has walked the suffering 
 He knows, He knows 
 Let your burdens come undone 
 Lift your eyes up to the One 
 Who knows 
 He knows 
 We may faint and we may sink 
 Feel the pain and near the brink 
 But the dark begins to shrink 
 When you find the one who knows 
 The chains of doubt that held you in between 
 One by one are starting to break free 
 Every time that you feel forsaken 
 Every time that you feel alone 
 He is near to the broken hearted 
 Every tear 
 He knows

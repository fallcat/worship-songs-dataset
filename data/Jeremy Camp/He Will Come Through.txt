So many decisions I have in store 
 So afraid I'll close up one more door. 
 And I know the only way, 
 Is that I trust You and obey. 
 The cluttered thoughts that are in my head, 
 Is the reaction that I dread. 
 And I know the only way, 
 Is that I trust You and obey. 
 He will come through, 
 Even when I don't know what to do. 
 He will come through, 
 Cause His word says it's true. 
 The feelings are overwhelming me, 
 But in the end, it's what You see. 
 And I know the only way, 
 Is that I trust You and obey. 
 He will come through, 
 Even when I don't know what to do. 
 He will come through, 
 Cause His word says it's true. 
 He will come through. 
 He will come through 
 He will come through 
 He will come through 
 He will come through 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Even when I don't know, 
 Even when I don't know, 
 Even when I don't know what to do 
 Even when I don't know what to do 
 Even when I don't know what to do 
 Even when I don't know what to do

You are the only One that brings me peace 
 You are the only One where hope is seen 
 The mercy You've given is more than I deserve 
 So I lay it down so I can heed Your Word, yeah 
 Hear my voice, I raise to You 
 With honor and praise 
 All glory is due 
 I lay it down all at Your feet 
 With lifted hands it's You we seek 
 To You we seek, oh my Jesus 
 I will see Your face 
 You are the only One that brings me truth 
 You are the only One that makes me new 
 The grace You've given a gift for all to see 
 This is why I give You everything, yeah 
 Hear my voice, I raise to You 
 With honor and praise 
 All glory is due 
 I lay it down all at Your feet 
 With lifted hands it's You we seek 
 And to You I lift my voice 
 And to You I lift my hands 
 And to You I give my heart 
 Hear my voice, I raise to You 
 Honor and praise 
 All glory is due 
 I lay it down all at Your feet 
 With lifted hands to You, to You we seek 
 Hear my voice, I raise to You 
 With honor and praise 
 All glory is due 
 I lay it down with everything that's in me 
 With lifted hands it's You we seek

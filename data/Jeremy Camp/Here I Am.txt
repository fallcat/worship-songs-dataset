You are waiting for us to move 
 There is so much more 
 Deeper than I've ever known, known before 
 When we draw near 
 I see the mysteries of who You are 
 Reveal my heart to be renewed 
 Until nothing's left but You 
 Only You 
 Here I am 
 Falling to my knees I'm crying out again 
 Jesus, take me deeper than I've ever been 
 Lord, here I am 
 All of me, reach into the places that I cannot see 
 Desperately, I need You to move in me 
 Here I am 
 You are waiting for me to see 
 All of who You are 
 God, You are so patient with me 
 Day after day 
 Come living water, let me drink from Your amazing grace 
 Reveal my heart to be renewed 
 Until nothing's left but You 
 Only You 
 Here I am 
 Falling to my knees I'm crying out again 
 Jesus, take me deeper than I've ever been 
 Lord, here I am 
 All of me reach into the places that I cannot see 
 Desperately, I need You to move me 
 Here I am 
 Let the things of Earth lose their hold on me 
 Let Your river flow, You are breaking me free 
 I will lift my hands in Your presence God 
 Make me like You are 
 Here I am 
 Falling to my knees I'm crying out again 
 All of me reaching to the places that I cannot see 
 Desperately, I need You to move me 
 Here I am 
 Here I am 
 Everything surrendered 
 I am Yours 
 Nothing else that matters 
 Laying down every one of my fears 
 God, won't You 
 God, won't You move me 
 Here I am

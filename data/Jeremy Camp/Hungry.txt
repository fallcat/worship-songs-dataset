Hungry, I come to You for I know You satisfy 
 I am empty, but I know Your love does not run dry 
 And so I wait for You 
 So I wait for You 
 Well, I'm falling on my knees 
 Offering all of me 
 Jesus, You're all this heart is living for 
 Broken, I run to You, for Your arms are open wide 
 I am weary, but I know your touch restores my life 
 So I wait for You 
 So I wait for You 
 Well, I'm falling on my knees 
 Offering all of me

 So I wait for You 
 For You

It seems I'm always in this place, 
 Where the things I seem to take, 
 Are the things I wish would fade. 
 I always purpose in my heart 
 Well, to do things the right way, 
 Then I realize I'm still clay. 
 And this piece that's being shaped, 
 Will be a beauty You create. 
 I am nothing without Your love. 
 I'm unworthy but Your death has been enough. 
 I'm completed by Your touch. 
 But I feel like I've been given so much. 
 So I thank You, I thank You 
 I wouldn't even face 
 All the troubles of the day, 
 If it wasn't for Your grace. 
 Sometimes I even wait, 
 To see if I'm awake, 
 It seems so good, I can't relate. 
 And Your every word I crave, 
 And I'm grateful for every breath I take. 
 I am nothing without Your love. 
 I'm unworthy but Your death has been enough. 
 I'm completed by Your touch. 
 But I feel like I've been given so much. 
 So I thank You, I thank You 
 When I'm feeling all my shame, 
 You won't let it stay. 
 I sail away into Your love. 
 I'm taking every day, 
 To give my life away. 
 It's the only way I know. 
 I am nothing without Your love. 
 I'm unworthy but Your death has been enough. 
 I'm completed by Your touch. 
 But I feel like I've been given so much. 
 And I am nothing, oh 
 You are everything 
 So I thank You, I thank You 
 Lord, I thank You 
 I thank You

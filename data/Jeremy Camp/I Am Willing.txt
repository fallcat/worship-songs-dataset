What do you see in me 
 'Cause I'm just a man 
 With all these insecurities 
 How can I even speak? 
 When the words they seem to fall 
 So far away from me, all my life 
 I have felt your purpose bathed in me 
 To you, I'm crawling now, so desperately 
 I am willing to be 
 Anything you want from me 
 'Cause you have given 
 New life to me 
 So many things unknown 
 The things that tore so deep 
 But in the end your will was shown 
 And I felt so drained 
 Last and blame 
 You pulled me out of that broken state 
 'Cause this idle time I've spent to know my pointless ways 
 The past is over now, the past is over 
 I am willing to be 
 Anything you want from me 
 'Cause you have given 
 New life to me 
 For your hand I'm holding out 
 Staring at your bleeding brow, always 
 Wanting to remember now 
 To live my life unselfishly 
 Breathe my breath so gratefully 
 I know, with you I'll face this very moment 
 'Cause I am willing to be 
 Anything you want from me 
 'Cause you have given 
 New life to me

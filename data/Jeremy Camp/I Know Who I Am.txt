I try so hard but I always fall short. 
 So I've faced the truth of my weakness. 
 There's nothing good that I can bring forth, 
 But I stand in the strength of Your presence. 
 I've wasted time always trying to face things alone, 
 But I wait here now and I lay it all down. 
 I know who I am and I know I'm not able 
 To stand on my own. 
 I can't live all alone. 
 So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out. 
 And I fall down, for You I fall down. 
 In times of brokenness always 
 You show the depth of love that You bring me. 
 And when I'm kneeling down in Your presence I know. 
 Your source of life I'm receiving. 
 I place myself in Your arms that will always lead me. 
 And I won't let go cause there's nowhere else to go. 
 I know who I am and I know I'm not able 
 To stand on my own. 
 I can't live all alone. 
 So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out. 
 And I fall down, for You I fall down, oh yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know why the things I want to do 
 I always run from now, oh, 
 Because I know apart from You 
 There's nothing that I can do 
 Where life will become new, oh. 
 And I know who I am 
 And I know I'm not able to stand on my own. 
 I can't live all alone. 
 So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out, 
 And I know that I'll take everything that's in me. 
 And I fall down, before You I fall down. 
 Before You I fall down, oh 
 Iâ€¦.

A broken image is sometimes what I see 
 But the hand that made me is the hand that won't leave me 
 You've begun a good work that only has begun 
 And you always lead me, lead me to your son 
 What I want to know everything you are 
 What I want to see your will for me and I know you'll show me 
 And I know you're calling, I see your arms stretched wide 
 And I feel you drawing, drawing me back again 
 Another day I can spend with you 
 You turn the pages telling me what to do 
 And when I feel like I want to fall again 
 You always lead me well you lead me to your hand 
 Oh what I want to know everything you are 
 What I want to see your will for me 
 And I know you'll show me 
 And I know I want everything that you want for me 
 Help me to understand your ways 
 I know I want that you want for me today

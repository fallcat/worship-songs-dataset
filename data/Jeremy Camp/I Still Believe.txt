Scattered words and empty thoughts 
 Seem to pour from my heart 
 I've never felt so torn before 
 Seems I don't know where to start 
 But it's now that I feel Your grace fall like rain 
 From every fingertip washing away my pain 
 'Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness 
 'Cause I still believe in Your truth 
 'Cause I still believe in Your Holy Word 
 Even when I don't see, I still believe 
 Though the questions still fog up my mind 
 With promises I still seem to bear 
 For even when answers slowly unwind 
 It's my heart I see You prepare 
 But it's now that I feel Your grace fall like rain 
 From every fingertip washing away my pain 
 'Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness 
 'Cause I still believe in Your truth 
 'Cause I still believe in Your Holy Word 
 Even when I don't see, I still believe 
 Well the only place I can go is into Your arms 
 Where I throw to You my feeble prayers 
 Well in brokenness I can see that this is Your will for me 
 Well help me to know that You are near 
 'Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness 
 'Cause I still believe in Your truth 
 'Cause I still believe in Your Holy Word 
 Even when I don't see, 'cause I still believe 
 'Cause I still believe 
 'Cause I still believe 
 I still believe, I still believe 
 Well I still believe 
 I still believe 
 I still believe 
 Oh 
 I still believe 
 I still believe

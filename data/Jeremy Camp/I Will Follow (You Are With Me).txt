Though the desert be before me 
 And there's no relief in sight 
 Though the enemy is breathing 
 All the lies into my mind 
 You will always carry me 
 Until my dying day 
 What you have for me is worth it 
 'Cause I'll see you face to face 
 I will follow, follow you wherever you go 
 And I will listen, to the very promises I know 
 You are with me, always with me 
 Keeper of my soul 
 I will follow, follow you wherever you go 
 And the day is coming quickly 
 When you break open the sky 
 And the armies all around you 
 Will be conquering the night 
 You gather all the children 
 That are calling out your name 
 When the troubles are the here and now 
 I know it's not in vain 
 I will follow, follow you wherever you go 
 And I will listen, to the very promises I know 
 You are with me, always with me 
 Keeper of my soul 
 I will follow, follow you wherever you go 
 You have my heart 
 I'll follow all the way 
 I will follow 
 I will follow, follow you wherever you go 
 And I will listen, to the very promises I know 
 You are with me, always with me 
 Keeper of my soul 
 I will follow, follow you wherever you go

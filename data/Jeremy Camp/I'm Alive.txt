I felt so overwhelmed with guilt. 
 I don't know how many times that I'd fight it. 
 Well, I'd try it and barely survived it. 
 I fell in the nearest pool of shame, 
 Took the blame and everything that surrounds it. 
 Well I found it and I drowned in it. 
 Oh, I never thought that I'd erase this or replace this feeling down. 
 Oh, but my whole life changed 
 When You saved me and forgave me now. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 I lost everything I had, but I'm glad 
 'Cause I would never have found You. 
 Well it rings true the words that spoke through. 
 You've given more than I can say. 
 And I know that I could never repay You, but I thank You. 
 I can't wait to embrace You. 
 Oh, I spun around for a long time and I always felt so blind. 
 Oh, I never thought I could feel it. 
 Well, I feel it now. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 Oh, I can feel it now every time I turn around. 
 Knowing I have been set free from the pain and misery. 
 I will make the most of this hope I have. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 Oh, I'll never thirst again 
 Oh, I'll never thirst again 
 I'll never thirst again 
 I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, like I've never been. 
 Been revived from the lies that were deep within. 
 It's the past now, it's the past. 
 'Cause Christ has given life where I'll never thirst again. 
 I'm alive, I'm alive like I've never been 
 I'm alive, I'm alive like I've never been

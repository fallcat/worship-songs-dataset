As I stand here in your presence, 
 Of your beauty I will always stand in awe, 
 I reach my hands out to the heavens, yeah, 
 And I lift my voice to you alone, To you alone, 
 As I bow my head before you, 
 I lay my burdens down at your nail pierced feet, 
 Every ounce of you radiates your glory, 
 With you I know that I'm complete 
 And I sing Hallelujah, 
 You are my God, Maker of the heavens, 
 Hallelujah, You are my LORD, 
 I bow before your presence, 
 As I stand here in your presence, 
 Of your beauty I will always stand in awe, 
 I reach my hands out to the heavens, yeah, 
 And I lift my voice to you alone, 
 And I sing Hallelujah, 
 You are my God, Maker of the heavens, 
 Hallelujah, You the LORD of all, Maker of all the heavens, 
 I can only kneel before your presence, 
 All the nations praise your Holy Name, 
 You are the great I Am, More than I can reason, 
 I realize more that I am needing you, 
 You are worthy, you are worthy LORD, 
 You are worthy, You are worthy, 
 You are mighty, You are mighty, 
 You are mighty, You are holy, 
 You are mighty, You are holy '..

Innocence is calling the way it's always been 
 I can feel my heart is reaching 
 I can see the calling to show Your heart within because I know Your blood is healing 
 All I am today and all I am is what Your hands have made me 
 Here my soul is yielding 
 As I fall down 
 I give all these weak hands have forsaken 
 As I fall down before You I know I've been broken 
 Lord I feel You drawing my heart into Your love 
 I can hear Your voice is pleading 
 I can see You molding the shape of purity 
 I am what You've laid before me 
 Here my soul is yielding 
 As I fall down 
 I give all these weak hands have forsaken 
 As I fall down before You I know I've been broken 
 As I fall down before the One whose hand has reached me out of this fear and doubt that's stolen all man's hope of knowing You 
 As I fall down 
 I give all these weak hands have forsaken 
 As I fall down before You I know I've been broken, yeah, yeah

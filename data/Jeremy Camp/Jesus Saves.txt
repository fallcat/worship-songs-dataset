Hope is here 
 Shout the news to everyone 
 It's a new day peace has come 
 Jesus saves 
 Mercy triumphs at the cross 
 Love has come to rescue us 
 Jesus saves 
 Hope is here 
 What a joyful noise we'll make 
 As we join with heaven's song 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Raise a shout to let all the world know 
 That Jesus saves 
 Free at last 
 Every debt has been repaid 
 Broken hearts can be remade 
 Jesus saves 
 Sing above the storms of life 
 Sing it through the darkest night 
 Jesus saves 
 Free at last 
 What a joyful noise we'll make 
 As we join with heaven's song 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Raise a shout to let all the world know 
 That Jesus saves 
 We'll sing it out 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Raise a shout 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 You save You heal 
 Restore, reveal, Your Father's heart to us 
 You rose to raise us from the grave 
 Your Spirit lives in us 
 Sing it out 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Raise a shout 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Shout it out 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Raise a shout 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Sing it out 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Raise a shout 
 To let all the world know that Jesus saves 
 Oh, sing it out 
 Shout 'till the whole world knows His name, Jesus 
 Sing it out 
 Shout for we will know Your name, Jesus 
 Jesus

Oh, Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock 
 Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring 
 Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun 
 Now the jingle hop's begun 
 Jingle bell 
 Jingle bell 
 Jingle bell rock 
 Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time 
 Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square 
 In the frosty air 
 What a bright time 
 It's the right time 
 To rock the night away 
 Jingle bell time is a swell time 
 To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh 
 Oh, giddy-up jingle horse pick up your feet 
 Jingle around the clock 
 Oh, mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet 
 That's the jingle bell 
 Yeah, come on - spoken 
 Yeah, what a bright time 
 It's the right time 
 To rock the night away 
 Jingle bell time is a swell time 
 To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh 
 Oh, giddy-up jingle horse pick up your feet 
 Jingle around the clock 
 Oh, mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet 
 That's the jingle bell 
 That's the jingle bell 
 That's the jingle bell rock 
 Spoken: 
 Yeah, come on 
 Everybody, shake those bells 
 We're dancing and prancing in the frosty air

All creation shook on that very day the Lamb was slain 
 Then redemption came to anyone who would call His name 
 With power and with strength You broke these heavy chains 
 And salvation reigned 
 And with a shout of praise and with our voices raised 
 King Jesus 
 You are victorious 
 You have conquered death 
 With this life of love 
 King Jesus 
 You are victorious 
 You paid the final debt 
 For all of us 
 King Jesus 
 You are victorious 
 None can separate the very hope and grace that He displayed 
 Neither height nor depth or anyone can steal the love He gave 
 And with a shout of praise and with our voices raised 
 King Jesus 
 You are victorious 
 You have conquered death 
 With this life of love 
 King Jesus 
 You are victorious 
 You paid the final debt 
 For all of us 
 King Jesus 
 You are victorious 
 One day every knee will bow 
 Behold You are in Your glory 
 Every tongue declare Your Holy name 
 King Jesus You are victorious 
 You are victorious 
 You are victorious 
 You are victorious 
 You are victorious 
 Oh yeah 
 You are victorious 
 You are victorious

Every single word I say 
 You know it before I speak 
 You know every thought the deepest part of me 
 You draw me closer than I see 
 Your presence is every thing I need to be the child that You've created me to be 
 I'm ready now to see it Your way 
 I lay down my pride 
 My desires my demise 
 I'm ready now to see it Your way 
 I'm done I'm through ignoring You now it's true 
 I'm kneeling at the cross of Your grace 
 Lay down my pride 
 I was faced with passing time but I knew the choice was mine 
 To finally come to You and give You all control 
 I've wandered miles to find my way and then You revealed this simple faith 
 I know that You can see the secrets of my soul 
 I lay down my pride 
 My desires my demise 
 I'm ready now to see it Your way 
 I'm done I'm through ignoring You now it's true 
 I'm kneeling at the cross of Your grace 
 I lay down my pride 
 My desires my demise 
 I'm ready now to see it Your way 
 I'm done I'm through ignoring You now it's true 
 I'm kneeling at the cross of Your grace 
 Lay down my pride 
 The cross 
 The blood You shed for me 
 Your back was ripped and bruised so I can know Your love 
 I kneel I bow to You my King 
 I lay down my pride 
 My desires my demise 
 I'm ready now to see it Your way 
 I'm done I'm through ignoring You now it's true 
 I'm kneeling at the cross of Your grace 
 I lay down my pride 
 My desires my demise 
 I'm ready now to see it Your way 
 I'm done I'm through ignoring You now it's true 
 I'm kneeling at the cross of Your grace 
 Lay down my pride

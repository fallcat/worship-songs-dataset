I'll praise You in the morning 
 I'll praise You in the evening 
 I'll praise You when I'm young and when I'm old 
 I'll praise You when I'm laughing 
 I'll praise You when I'm grieving 
 I'll praise You every season of the soul 
 If we could see 
 How much You're worth 
 Your power, 
 Your might, 
 Your endless love 
 Then surely we would 
 Never cease to praise You 
 Everything that,

 Your power,

 Your endless love 
 Then surely we would 
 Never cease to praise You

Have you been walking on a surface that's uncertain? 
 Have you helped yourself to everything that's empty? Yeah 
 You can't live this way too long 
 There's more than this, more than this 
 Have you been standing on your own feet too long? 
 Have you been looking for a place where you belong? 
 You can rest, you will find rest 
 You can rest, you will find rest 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade 
 Let this new life offered be your saving grace 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade, let it fade 
 Have you been holding on to what this world has offered? 
 Have you been giving in to all these masquerades? 
 It will be gone 
 Forever gone 
 It will be gone 
 It will be gone 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade 
 Let this new life offered be your saving grace 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade, let it fade 
 Let it fade. 
 Are you carrying the weight too much, are you running from the call? 
 Let it fade, oh yeah 
 You can rest, you will find rest 
 You can rest, you will find rest 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade 
 Let this new life offered be your saving grace 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade, let it fade, oh 
 Let it fade 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade 
 Let this old life crumble, let it fade 
 Have you been standing on your own feet too long? 
 Have you been looking for a place where you belong?

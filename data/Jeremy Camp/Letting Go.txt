Gripping on so tight with the security I have inside 
 Knowing what is right 
 Holding onto my pride 
 Letting go of all the things I hold so dear 
 Letting go of all my pain and all my fears 
 Letting go of all the things I hold so dear 
 Letting go of all my pain and all my fears 
 I have been brought to a place 
 Where I want to give up everything 
 Where all I can do is seek Your face 
 And my brokenness I will bring 
 Letting go of all the things I hold so dear 
 Letting go of all my pain and all my fears 
 Letting go of all the things I hold so dear 
 Letting go of all my pain and all my fears 
 Holding on to the things I deem so strong 
 Holding on even though my faith has been built so long 
 Holding on to the things I deem so strong, oh yeah 
 Holding on to what I know 
 I'm letting go 
 Letting go of all the things I hold so dear 
 Letting go of all my pain and all my fears 
 Letting go of all the things I hold so dear 
 Letting go of all my pain and all my fears 
 Letting go, yeah 
 I'm letting go

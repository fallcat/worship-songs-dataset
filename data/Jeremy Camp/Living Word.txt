In this life there is one guarantee 
 This broken world will only leave me empty 
 But there's a life that healed my heart 
 And it holds firm when I'm falling apart 
 I will stand on the truth 
 In the living word of God 
 'Cause every time it moves my soul and shapes my every thought 
 It's alive in me, the very breath I breathe 
 I'm holding on with all I've got to the living word, 
 The living word of God 
 The living word of God 
 I can't survive on bread alone 
 I hunger and I thirst for your words that give me hope 
 I stand on the truth 
 In the living word of God 
 'Cause every time it moves my soul and shapes my every thought 
 It's alive in me, the very breath I breathe 
 I'm holding on with all I've got to the living word, 
 The living word of God 
 Speak into me now 
 Your voice is all I'm craving 
 What a freedom I have found 
 In the living word of God 
 I will stand on the truth 
 In the living word of God 
 'Cause every time it moves my soul and shapes my every thought 
 It's alive in me, the very breath I breathe 
 I'm holding on with all I've got to the living word, 
 The living word of God 
 The living word of God 
 The living word of God

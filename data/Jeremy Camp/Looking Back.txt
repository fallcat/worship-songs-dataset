Many times I take for granted 
 Just what you've done for me 
 The heart in which you've planted 
 Is precious for you to see 
 The cross in which you've hung 
 Is not a plcae for a king to be 
 Lord the wounds that stung you did it all for, you did it all for me 
 You've always been so faithful 
 Even when I don't deserve 
 Lord help me to be more grateful 
 Of the love that you preserve 
 The cross in which you've hung 
 Is not a plcae for a king to be 
 Lord the wounds that stung you did it all for, you did it all for me 
 Help me to look into your gracious eyes 
 Take the selfishness away from me 
 O yeah yeah he died for me 
 O yeah yeah he died for me 
 O yeah yeah 
 Help me to look into your gracious eyes 
 Take the selfishness away from me 
 He died for me

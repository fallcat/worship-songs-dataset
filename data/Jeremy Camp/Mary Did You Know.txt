Mary, did you know 
 That your baby boy, would one day walk on water? 
 Mary, did you know 
 That your baby boy, would save our sons and daughters? 
 Did you know 
 That your baby boy, has come to make you new? 
 This child that you delivered will soon deliver you 
 Mary, did you know 
 Mary, did you know 
 That your baby boy, will give sight to a blind man? 
 Mary, did you know 
 That your baby boy, will calm a storm with his hand? 
 Did you know 
 That your baby boy, has walked where angels trod? 
 When you kiss your little baby you kissed the face of God? 
 Mary did you know 
 Oh, Mary did you know, oh 
 The blind will see 
 The deaf will hear 
 The dead will live again 
 The lame will leap 
 The dumb will speak 
 The praises of the Lamb, oh 
 Will sing your praise 
 Mary, did you know 
 That your baby boy, is Lord of all creation? 
 Mary, did you know 
 That your baby boy, will one day rule the nations? 
 Did you know 
 That your baby boy, is Heaven's perfect Lamb? 
 The sleeping child you're holding is the great I Am 
 The great I Am

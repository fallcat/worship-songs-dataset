I can feel it coming over me, 
 All the weight of what this fear can bring. 
 I know on my own i can't survive and I'm fading fast now. 
 I'm closing in on what's in store for me. 
 All the rest in Your security. 
 I'm holding on to the words You speak, 
 And You're speaking clear now. 
 I'm running fast to seek Your face, oh yeah. 
 Head first I dive into Your grace. 
 You are my fortress, 
 You are the refuge where I hide. 
 You are the strength when I can't fight. 
 You are the only one I rest my life in. 
 You are the only hope I find. 
 You are my only peace of mind. 
 You are the only one I rest my life in. 
 I'm taking hold of what's in front of me. 
 A place where I can rest my weary feet. 
 There's no other place that I can go, 
 So I'm waiting here now. 
 I'm letting go of what the world will bring, 
 A sanctuary that will never breathe. 
 I found my heart in that place before, 
 And I'll never go back. 
 I'm running fast to seek Your face, oh yeah. 
 Head first I dive into Your grace. 
 You are my fortress, 
 You are the refuge where I hide. 
 You are the strength when I can't fight. 
 You are the only one I rest my life in. 
 You are the only hope I find. 
 You are my only peace of mind. 
 You are the only one I rest my life in. 
 I get lost within that place. 
 The place where I'll always wish I'd stay. 
 Oh, You are my fortress, 
 You are the refuge 
 You are the only hope I find. 
 You are the only one I rest my life in. 
 Oh, You are my fortress, 
 You are the refuge 
 You are my only peace of mind. 
 You are the only one I rest my life in. 
 Oh, You are the only one 
 The only one I rest my life in, Lord 
 You are my hope, 
 My strength, my life, my peace 
 My rock, my joy, my everything now, oh 
 You are the refuge where I hide. 
 You are the only one I rest my life in

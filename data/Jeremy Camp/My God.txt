All of who You are reaches the darkest parts 
 Lifting the weight and erasing the scars that had a hold on me 
 Here I am, bearing all, tearing down every wall 
 So amazed by Your grace, and the way You're still holding me 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, woah 
 My God, You are the unchanging love 
 My God, Your heart sends hope from above 
 The Great Creator, Beautiful Savior 
 I've been redeemed 
 There is life now from Your victory 
 You are my God (You are my God) 
 There is no other one, who's given a greater love 
 Laying aside His own life on the cross 
 Reaching out to us 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, woah 
 My God, You are the unchanging love 
 My God, Your heart sends hope from above 
 The Great Creator, Beautiful Savior 
 I've been redeemed 
 There is life now from Your victory 
 You are my God (You are my God) 
 When my hope starts fading out 
 You are where my strength is found 
 I know I won't be alone 
 My God, You are a beautiful love 
 My God, You are a beautiful love 
 My God, You are a beautiful love 
 My God, You are a beautiful love

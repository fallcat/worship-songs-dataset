You kept on calling my name 
 Through all my darkness and haze 
 Even when I had fell apart 
 You held me close to Your heart 
 When I have gone astray 
 How You would chase me 
 How You would chase me 
 When I was so afraid 
 You would embrace me 
 You would embrace me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 Over and over again 
 You prove a faithful friend 
 From here, You'll never turn away 
 'Cause You're love, You cannot forsake 
 When I have gone astray 
 How You would chase me 
 How You would chase me 
 When I was so afraid 
 You would embrace me 
 You would embrace me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You moved heaven and earth 
 The cross, You have endured 
 I am the joy in Your eyes 
 You moved heaven and earth 
 The cross, You have endured 
 I am the joy in Your eyes 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 When I have gone astray 
 How You would chase me 
 How You would chase me 
 When I was so afraid 
 You would embrace me 
 You would embrace me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You never stopped loving 
 You never stopped loving me

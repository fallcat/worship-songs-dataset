I know that everytime 
 I find the one thing that holds me back inside 
 I want to tear apart 
 And bring my selfish pleasures at Your feet. 
 'Cause every part of me is an offering, 
 I will set forth and lay it down at Your throne now. 
 Because I live for You alone. 
 No matter what it takes I will offer. 
 Everything I am I give to You. 
 Even unto death I will follow, 
 No matter what the price I will give to You now. 
 I won't throw this time I have aside, 
 You're the very prize I have in sight. 
 You've placed this purpose down in me, 
 And it burns so deep. 
 Let this life I lead bring You all the glory, 
 I'm entrusted with a gift that I can't hide. 
 Revive my heart, revive my mind. 
 No matter what it takes I will offer. 
 Everything I am I give to You. 
 Even unto death I will follow, 
 No matter what the price I will give to You now. 
 I will give to You now 
 To live is to really die. 
 I will keep this steady pace 
 Until that final day. 
 No matter what it takes I will offer. 
 Everything I am I give to You. 
 Even unto death I will follow, 
 No matter what the price I will give to You now. 
 No matter what it takes I will offer. 
 Everything I am I give to You. 
 Even unto death I will follow, 
 No matter what the price I will give to You now. 
 I will give to You now 
 I will give to You now

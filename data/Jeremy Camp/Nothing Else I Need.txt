When I think of all I've seen 
 Nothing compares to what You give 
 And to drink of what You bring 
 You quench the thirst for me to live 
 I am satisfied by what tenderness You've shown to me 
 And I empty all that I am 
 And You fill my life 
 You're everything to me 
 And there's nothing else I need anymore 
 And I know You are everything to me 
 And there's nothing else I need anymore 
 I have tasted and I know 
 This fire birthed inside will only grow 
 And I've sought all that this world tried to offer me and it led me to Your feet 
 And I empty all that I am 
 And You fill my life 
 You're everything to me 
 And there's nothing else I need anymore 
 And I know You are everything to me 
 And there's nothing else I need anymore 
 I will lay down all my needs and You will come and make them new 
 To make You my only desire 
 My desire 
 And You fill my life 
 You're everything to me 
 Everything to me, yeah 
 And You fill my life 
 You're everything to me 
 And there's nothing else I need anymore 
 And I know You are everything to me 
 And there's nothing else I need anymore 
 There's nothing else I need... 
 And there's nothing else I need anymore 
 There's nothing else I need... 
 There's nothing else I need... 
 Nothing else I needâ€¦ 
 There's nothing else I need... 
 There's nothing else I need... 
 There's nothing else I need...

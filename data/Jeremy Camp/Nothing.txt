Well I must have been good I must have been right 
 To see you standing holding, holding me tight 
 With your arms around me I know that you are there 
 You're never in the distance I always know you're near 
 Nothing I can do, nothing I can say 
 Can make you love me more, your love remains the same 
 You gave it all for me, you gladly took my place 
 To rid myself of all, all my guilt and shame 
 I must have stood strong, I must have stood tight 
 To yield the thoughts around me, the battle in my mind 
 And knowing you surround me, your wings coat my despair 
 Whatever my condition, the cross it shows you care

O little town of Bethlehem, 
 How still we see Thee the lie! 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by; 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting Light; 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in Thee tonight. 
 For Christ is born of Mary, 
 And gathered all above, 
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep 
 Their watch of wondering love. 
 O morning stars, together 
 Proclaim the holy birth, 
 And praises sing to God the King, 
 And peace to men on earth! 
 You bring us peace 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 You bring us peace 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 O holy Child of Bethlehem, 
 Descend to us, we pray; 
 Cast out our sin, and enter in, 
 Be born in us today. 
 We hear the Christmas angels 
 The great glad tidings tell; 
 O come to us, abide with us, 
 Our Lord Emmanuel! 
 You bring us peace 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 You bring us peace 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 Emmanuel 
 Hallelujah 
 You bring us peace 
 Hallelujah to the Lord

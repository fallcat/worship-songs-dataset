One day at a time I will walk this road I've traveled so far 
 One day at a time well I know I will carry on 
 One day at a time I can see you took my life this far 
 One day at a time I will take this faith along 
 All this hope I breathe is given by the hand that carries me 
 Until I'm complete and I'll take all I will 
 To understand this plan you have for me, for me 
 I've been shut up shut down held out held down 
 In ways I never knew I would 
 I can feel your fullness in my life 
 Well I've been burned out broken torn out torn down 
 In ways I never knew I would 
 I can feel your fullness in my life 
 One day at a time I will take these words you've given me 
 One day at a time I will rest in knowing you 
 One day at a time I will share this gift you've given me 
 One day at a time I will walk these valleys through 
 All I know is that I see how much my heart 
 Is longing to be cradled by your side 
 And I'll give all I can to one day soon 
 Be held by your hand, by your hand 
 In all these things I will press on 
 I'll be with you I know it won't be long

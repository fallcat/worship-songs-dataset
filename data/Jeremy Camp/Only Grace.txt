In the morning, when I rise 
 In the morning, when I rise 
 In the morning, when I rise 
 Give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 You can have all this world 
 Just give me Jesus 
 When I am alone 
 When I am alone 
 Oh, when I am alone 
 Give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 You can have all this world 
 Just give me Jesus 
 Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 When I come to die 
 When I come to die 
 Oh, when I come to die 
 Give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 You can have all this world 
 Just give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 Give me Jesus 
 You can have all this world 
 You can have all this world 
 You can have all this world 
 Just give me Jesus 
 Jesus

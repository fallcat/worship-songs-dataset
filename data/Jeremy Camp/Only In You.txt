There's a place 
 Where thirsty souls 
 Find living water 
 And thirst no more 
 And there's a place 
 Where weary hearts 
 Find perfect rest 
 In mercy's arms 
 In mercy's arms 
 Only in You, hey, only in You, hey 
 Here in Your presence 
 You're making us new 
 Only in You, hey, only in You, hey 
 Nothing compares to the life we find only in You 
 There's a place 
 Where fear can't stand 
 Where the broken down 
 Need healing hands 
 And there's a place 
 Where glory's light 
 Makes shackles fall 
 And shadows hide, and shadows hide 
 Our strong tower 
 Our great refuge 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 Halleluiah, we have found 
 The source of everything we need

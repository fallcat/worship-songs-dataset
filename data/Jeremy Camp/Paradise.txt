Can't wait to walk along Your side 
 And feel the beauty of Your love 
 And the fullness of Your grace now 
 Can't wait to finally be alive 
 To be in the place where I belong, 
 To know I've fought for what's right 
 Don't let this life take hold of my desires 
 And I won't give up the fight 
 Cause one day I will be with You in paradise, paradise 
 But until that day, I will surrender all my life, all my life 
 We'll sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah, every knee will bow and say 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, we'll bring glory to Your name 
 Can't wait to walk the streets of gold 
 And see a lion with a lamb, 
 And colors that are untold 
 Can't wait to look into Your face 
 And see the majesty and glory 
 That makes the Earth shake 
 Cause one day I will be with You in paradise, paradise 
 But until that day, I will surrender all my life, all my life 
 We'll sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah, every knee will bow and say 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, we'll bring glory to Your name 
 On my knees, I will glorify, in paradise 
 On my knees, I will glorify, in paradise 
 On my knees, I will glorify, in paradise 
 Cause one day... 
 I know I will be with You 
 We'll sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah, every knee will bow and say 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, we'll bring glory to Your name 
 Cause one day I will be with You in paradise, paradise 
 But until that day, I will surrender all my life, all my life 
 We'll sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah, every knee will bow and say 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, we'll bring glory to Your name

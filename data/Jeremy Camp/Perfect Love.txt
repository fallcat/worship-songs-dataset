If perfect love casts out fear 
 Then here I am Lord drawing near 
 Days have come, days have gone 
 I know one thing's sure 
 Hanging on by the words of Your promise, Lord 
 You are good, you are true 
 Even in my pain 
 And I'm thankful for this suffering 
 'Cause it's brought me right here on my knees 
 If perfect love casts out fear 
 Then here I am Lord drawing near 
 I'm crying out and You hear my prayer 
 I feel the depth of how much You care 
 In Your perfect love 
 You are perfect love 
 I'm wide awake, wide awake 
 Now my eyes can see 
 All the hope, all the plans that you have for me 
 I count in joy ever time I am in this place 
 And I'm thankful for this suffering 
 It's deepened every part of me 
 I cast my cares, cast my cares 
 On Your altar Lord (always, always) 
 'Cause You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures (always, always) 
 I will rest, I will rest 
 In Your perfect love (always, always) 
 There's no more fear, no more fear 
 In Your presence Lord

Everytime I try to play it safe 
 Holding back just a little part of me 
 I find myself forgetting what 
 I say that I believe 
 The promise of Your Word 
 Is all I need 
 I'll lay my life down 
 And give it up 
 I'll give it up 
 I wanna be reckless 
 Cause You are endless 
 I wanna be shameless 
 And shout Your greatness 
 I will not be afraid 
 To surrender my way 
 And follow who You are 
 I wanna be reckless, reckless 
 I will lose my life 
 And just let go 
 Because I know this world is not my home 
 With fearless faith 
 I won't be moved 
 Unshakeable inside Your truth 
 You laid Your life down 
 And gave it up 
 So I'll give it up 
 I wanna be reckless 
 Cause You are endless 
 I wanna be shameless 
 And shout Your greatness 
 I will not be afraid 
 To surrender my way 
 And follow who You are 
 I wanna be reckless, reckless 
 I won't waste any more time 
 My life's Yours it is not mine 
 Use me Lord no matter what's at stake

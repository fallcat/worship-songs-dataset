I have seen so many teardrops 
 Fall to the ground 
 I've held the hand of God's children 
 Once lost and now found 
 I have walked it and I know 
 That my King is alive 
 And no other one 
 Has the love You provide 
 I want all who I meet 
 To see You through me 
 I want all that I speak to be You 
 If there's anything that I would pray 
 It's that the whole world would seek Your face 
 And in spite of who I can be 
 Please reign in me 
 Reign in me 
 I know it starts with the desire 
 To give You control 
 To lay down all my dreams 
 So You have my heart in full 
 Lord I know this weary battle 
 It begins on my knees 
 In everything I want You to be pleased 
 I want all who I meet 
 To see You through me 
 I want all that I speak to be You 
 If there's anything that I would pray 
 It's that the whole world would seek Your face 
 And in spite of who I can be 
 Please reign in me 
 Reign in me 
 I can see the waters rising 
 I can hear the hearts reviving 
 Through You there's nothing we can't do 
 Let's carry the people crying 
 And be a generation fighting 
 To lead the lost into Your hands 
 If there's anything that I would pray 
 It's that the whole world would seek Your face 
 And in spite of who I can be 
 Please reign in me, oh yeah 
 Reign in me, yeah 
 Reign in me, yeah 
 Reign in me, reign in me 
 (In my heart, in my mind, in my soul 
 Be the Lord of my life, take control)

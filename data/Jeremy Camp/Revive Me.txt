Consider my affliction and please deliver me 
 Plead my cause and redeem me 
 Salvation is not for the wicked 
 For they don't seek Your Word 
 Great are Your tender mercies Lord 
 Revive me, according to Your loving kindness 
 Revive me, that I may seek Your Word 
 Revive me, according to Your loving kindness 
 Revive me, oh Lord 
 You give me understanding 
 According to Your Word 
 Great peace for those who seek Your face 
 I long for salvation 
 My lips shall praise Your name 
 I rejoice in the treasure of Your keep 
 Revive me, according to Your loving kindness 
 Revive me, that I may seek Your Word 
 Revive me, according to Your loving kindness 
 Revive me, oh Lord 
 For all my ways are before You 
 I let Your hand become my help 
 My soul longs and adores You 
 Let my cry come before You oh Lord 
 Revive me, according to Your loving kindness 
 Revive me, that I may seek Your Word 
 Revive me, according to Your loving kindness 
 Revive me, oh Lord 
 Oh, revive me 
 Revive me

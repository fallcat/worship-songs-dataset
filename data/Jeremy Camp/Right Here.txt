All the world is watching/all the world does care 
 Even when the world weighs on my shoulder now 
 These feelings I can bear 
 Because I know, that You're here 
 Everywhere I go I know You're not far away 
 You're right here, You're right here 
 All these thoughts I've wasted 
 All these thoughts I've feared 
 Even when these thoughts are faded 
 I still know that You hear 
 So I can rest my hope in You 
 Everywhere I go I know You're not far away 
 You're right here, You're right here 
 The many times that I have felt alone 
 The many times that I have felt the world was crashing down upon me 
 You always stood here by my side 
 You were always there 
 Everywhere I go I know You're not far away. 
 You're right here, You're right here

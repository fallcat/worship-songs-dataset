I can see 
 Waters raging at my feet 
 I can feel 
 The breath of those surrounding me 
 I can hear 
 The sound of nations rising up 
 We will not be overtaken 
 We will not be overcome 
 I can walk 
 Down this dark and painful road 
 I can face 
 Every fear of the unknown 
 I can hear 
 All God's children singing out 
 We will not be overtaken 
 We will not be overcome 
 The same power that rose Jesus from the grave 
 The same power that commands the dead to wake 
 Lives in us, lives in us 
 The same power that moves mountains when He speaks 
 The same power that can calm a raging sea 
 Lives in us, lives in us 
 He lives in us, lives in us 
 We have hope 
 That His promises are true 
 In His strength 
 There is nothing we can't do 
 Yes, we know 
 There are greater things in store 
 We will not be overtaken 
 We will not be overcome 
 Greater is He that is living in me 
 He's conquered our enemy 
 No power of darkness 
 No weapon prevails 
 We stand here in victory

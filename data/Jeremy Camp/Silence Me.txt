The many worlds I speak I turn around them all 
 (I turn them all) 
 Talking about myself and all the things I need 
 I need to be patient and listen to your voice 
 Help me to know you, help me to here. 
 Silence me so I can here you 
 Open up my ears so I can here you 
 Help my actions speak louder than my words 
 To live my life out loud about the love between you and me 
 (Between you and me) 
 I need to be ? and I know that you are guide 
 Help me to you, help me to hear. 
 Silence me so I can hear you 
 Open up my ears so I can hear you. 
 Silence me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

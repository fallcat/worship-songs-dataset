Staring at this empty canvas 
 Waiting for the next stroke of my life 
 It seems to go by so fast 
 Another day I've wasted wondering how it all ends up, instead of resting that it's all in Your hands 
 My only peace is waiting before You 
 With my praise to You drowning the noise around me 
 I wish I could slow down time, I wish I could wait here at Your feet 
 'Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be 
 I know I should take it all in stride, I know You are there with every reach 
 'Cause with You is the only place that I want to be 
 On my own I always fade out fast 
 But on the rock my every step will last 
 I'm resting in Your words that never fail 
 You're searching every part of me 
 I need to stop so I can hear You speak 
 I long for You, so here I am so thirsty 
 My only peace is waiting before You, oh 
 With my praise to You drowning the noise around me 
 I wish I could slow down time, I wish I could wait here at Your feet 
 'Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be, oh 
 I know I should take it all in stride, I know You are there with every reach 
 'Cause with You is the only place that I want to be, oh 
 It's where I want to be 
 All the greatness of Your presence leaves me kneeling,  so speechless 
 I've given up on making this life my home 
 Oh, when the fullness of Your glory is beyond my comprehension, there's no greater joy than being with You, my King 
 I wish I could slow down time, I wish I could wait here at Your feet 
 'Cause with You is the only place that I wanna be now 
 I know I should take it all in stride, I know You are there with every reach 
 'Cause with You is the only place that I want to be, oh yeah 
 Slow down time 
 Wait right here 
 The only place I want to be

So many times I've fallen, 
 So many ways I've failed You. 
 So many times I've stepped out on my own. 
 I know I'm undeserving, 
 But I feel You are preserving 
 The only good that I have shown. 
 The only words that I can bring 
 Are these very words I sing, 
 So I sing to You now. 
 'Cause I am so in love with You. 
 There's nothing else I'd choose. 
 You've stolen my heart. 
 Yes, I'm all for You. 
 Nothing can separate me 
 From the grace that You gave free. 
 I know You'll never let me go. 
 Even though You know my frailties, 
 Every single thing about me. 
 You showed the greatest love that's known. 
 The only words that I can bring 
 Are these very words I sing. 
 So I sing to You now. 
 Oh, I am so in love with You. 
 There's nothing else I'd choose. 
 You've stolen my heart. 
 Yes, I'm all for You. 
 Oh, I am so in love with You. 
 There's nothing else I'd choose. 
 You've stolen my heart. 
 Yes, I'm all for You now 
 Time and time again You show 
 The depth of love that You bestow. 
 I'll never fully understand, 
 It's too great for me to know. 
 But I'll always try to bring, 
 I'll try to bring You everything, oh yeah. 
 I am so in love with You. 
 There's nothing else I'd choose. 
 You've stolen my heart, oh, 
 You have my heart now. 
 I am so in love with You. 
 There's nothing else I'd choose. 
 You've stolen my heart, yes. 
 Oh, I know it's true now. 
 I am so in love, love with You. 
 You've stolen my heart, yes 
 Here's my heart, 
 Oh, Jesus, I'm so in love with You 
 There's nothing else I'd choose 
 You've stolen my heart, yes 
 I'm all, I'm all for You now. 
 I'm so in love 
 There's nothing else in this world 
 That will ever compare to You 
 I'm all for You 
 Oh, my Jesus, You are everything 
 You are everything 
 I'm so in love with You 
 Oh, my Jesus, my Jesus 
 Here's my heart

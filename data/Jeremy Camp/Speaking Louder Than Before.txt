Hear now this declaration from out across the nations 
 We need to wake up and understand 
 Many hurting hearts are crying, but our voices seem to be dying 
 Can You see the battle raging on? 
 We are the light to reach this world 
 We are the salt preserving these souls 
 Let's show them the love that we've received now 
 We are, we are in desperation 
 We need to reach this generation 
 We are speaking louder than before 
 We have a hope that's been forgotten 
 We have a love that will be broadened and we are speaking louder than before 
 Take every chance that You can, move together, taking a stand 
 Never losing heart, we'll speak as one 
 We need to be the image of Christ, to show love and serve at all times 
 We can make a difference in this land 
 We are the light to reach this world 
 We are the salt preserving these souls 
 Let's show them the love that we've received now 
 We are, we are in desperation 
 We need to reach this generation 
 We are speaking louder than before 
 We have a hope that's been forgotten 
 We have a love that will be broadened and we are speaking louder than before 
 Everything's surreal, but this urgency I feel 
 We should be reaching out to all these desperate pleas, oh 
 The need is real, can't You feel this call to revolution? 
 My beating heart is breaking for them 
 That's why I'm speaking now, that's why I'm speaking now 
 We are, we are in desperation 
 We need to reach this generation 
 We are speaking louder than before 
 We have a hope that's been forgotten 
 We have a love that will be broadened 
 We are speaking louder than before 
 We are, we are, we are, we're speaking louder 
 We are, we are, we are, we're speaking louder 
 We are, we are, we are, louder than before 
 We are speaking louder than before, oh yeah

We want Your spirit now 
 We want Your spirit now 
 Come and fall on us 
 We need Your spirit now 
 We need Your spirit now 
 Come and move in us 
 I bear my soul 
 Invade every part of me 
 Come so close 
 I can feel Your heartbeat 
 Let Your fire consume what is not of You 
 So take our shame 
 And cleanse our failings 
 So we may come and declare You holy 
 Shake these wall so we will never be the same 
 We surrender, surrender 
 We let Your spirit move 
 We let Your spirit move 
 And forever, forever 
 Let us burn for You 
 Let us burn for You 
 (x2) 
 Where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, freedom 
 Where the spirit of the Lord is there is healing, healing 
 Where the spirit of the Lord is there is power, power 
 Send Your power now in us

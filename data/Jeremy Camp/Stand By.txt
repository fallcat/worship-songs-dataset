Tell me wrong 
 Tell me Right 
 I don't want empty words tonight 
 I want to be real 
 More than I feel 
 I can see my life is, molding into Yours 
 I receive, all these cries that soften everything I fight 
 This battle inside, only to feel this constant hope for me 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be the words that You spoke 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be, the words that You've spoken to me 
 I feel it so strong 
 My heart and my mind 
 Only to reconnect this truth divine 
 To show, my faith every day 
 Only to walk this life that You've displayed 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be, the words that You've spoke 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be, the words that You've spoken to me 
 Spoken to me 
 And I've chosen now to take each step and follow in life or death 
 And I'm living now to only give my all... 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be, the words that You've spoke 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be, the words that You've spoke 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be, the words that You've spoke 
 I want to stand by 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be, the words that You've spoken to me... 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be 
 The words that you've spoken to me... 
 I want to live by 
 I want to be

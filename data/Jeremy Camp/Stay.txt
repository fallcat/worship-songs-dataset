Well I can feel within your soul, 
 The more you reason, the more you've shown he's there, 
 You can see the only way of falling down, 
 Is when your looking everywhere, 
 So far from this, you can live, 
 So far from this, 
 Come on now, stay 
 Right here in the light, 
 So that you won't walk away, away (yeah) 
 Well come on now, stay 
 Right here in the light, 
 Throw your burdens all away, away 
 Throw your burdens all away 
 Well, the thought of wondering down, 
 On this place of open road, 
 You speak the very part, 
 Though your actions always show, 
 How easily you sway, 
 But isn't he who takes, 
 All these heart felt cries, 
 And broken pride, and walks along this hill, 
 Not far away, 
 So far from this you can live, so far from this 
 Oh, Well... come on now, stay 
 Right here in the light, 
 So that you won't walk away, away (yeah) 
 Well come on now, stay 
 Right here in the light, 
 Throw your burdens all away, away 
 Throw your burdens all away 
 Throw your burdens all away 
 Well, can you feel those arms around you? 
 Well, can you see this place surround you? 
 Well, can you hear the people calling? 
 Well, I can see your fear! 
 Come on now, stay 
 Right here in the light, 
 So that you won't walk away, away (yeah) 
 Well come on now, Stay 
 Right here in the light, 
 Throw your burdens all away, away 
 Throw your burdens all away 
 Throw your burdens all away

Purify this tainted soul. 
 I'm tired of living life a fool. 
 Soften up this hardened clay. 
 To be a servant, this I pray. 
 A reflection of You I long to be. 
 So Your Kingdom I will seek. 
 And I surrender to Your throne, oh. 
 I surrender to Your throne. 
 And I will make my heart Your home, oh. 
 I surrender to Your throne. 
 I've taken things I thought my own, 
 Only to reap all I've sown. 
 You've given back the years I've fought. 
 Unending love and grace You've brought. 
 Eternal hope and peace You bring. 
 And forever unto You I will sing. 
 And I surrender to Your throne, oh. 
 I surrender to Your throne. 
 And I will make my heart Your home, oh. 
 I surrender to Your throne. 
 Forever unto You I will sing. 
 Forever unto You I will sing. 
 Forever unto You I will sing. 
 Forever unto You I will sing. 
 And I surrender. 
 I surrender 
 And I surrender. 
 I surrender 
 And I surrender now, oh 
 I surrender. 
 I surrender 
 And I surrender. 
 I surrender 
 And I surrender now, oh 
 I surrender. 
 I surrender. 
 And I surrender now 
 Oh, I surrender. 
 I surrender. 
 And I surrender now. 
 Soften up this hardened clay 
 To be a servant this I pray.

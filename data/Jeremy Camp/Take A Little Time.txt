I picture all the things that I have seen, 
 All the broken hearts and tainted memories. 
 And all I see are all these needs. 
 I'm tired of my selfish tragedies. 
 It's time that we show, 
 The hope that we all know 
 And take just a little time, 
 To give your hand, 
 See the world 
 And take just a little time and try to understand, 
 That there's more going on, 
 Than what these eyes can see. 
 I came across this torn down empty street. 
 How helpless that I felt 
 This burning urgency. 
 And all I see in front of me 
 Are faces fading from this vacant scene. 
 It's time that we show, 
 The hope that we all know 
 And take just a little time, 
 To give your hand, 
 See the world 
 And take just a little time and try to understand 
 I know it all seems complicated, 
 There's nothing more that could be stated. 
 Now is the time to kneel, 
 Reaching out for what is real, 
 So many times I've hesitated, 
 How much I feel my heart is aching now. 
 Oh, now. 
 And take just a little time, 
 To give your hand 
 Take just a little time, 
 To give your hand, 
 See the world 
 And take just a little time and try to understand, 
 That there's more going on, 
 Than what these eyes can see.

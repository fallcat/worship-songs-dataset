Here I am before You now 
 Like a child I'm reaching out 
 Here I am I'm giving all I can 
 Breaking my pride I feel I'm through 
 Shattered inside I run to You 
 And now I give it all to You 
 Take my life, Take my mind 
 Take my soul take my will 
 I am yours now, and I give it all to You 
 Laying all down before my King 
 Offering all my everything 
 Laying all down before the one I serve 
 I can understand the reasons why 
 You came on this earth and died 
 And now I give it all to You 
 I can feel You on my shoulder 
 So I know that You are there 
 I can see You paint my picture 
 The beauty is all there

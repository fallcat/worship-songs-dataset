I try to hold on to this world with everything I have 
 But I feel the weight of what it brings, and the hurt that tries to grab 
 The many trials that seem to never end, His word declares this truth, 
 That we will enter in this rest with wonders anew 
 But I hold on to this hope and the promise that He brings 
 That there will be a place with no more suffering 
 There will be a day with no more tears, no more pain, and no more fears 
 There will be a day when the burdens of this place, 
 Will be no more, we'll see Jesus face to face 
 But until that day, we'll hold on to you always 
 I know the journey seems so long 
 You feel you're walking on your own 
 But there has never been a step 
 Where you've walked out all alone 
 Troubled soul don't lose your heart 
 Cause joy and peace he brings 
 And the beauty that's in store 
 Outweighs the hurt of life's sting 
 I can't wait until that day where the very one 
 I've lived for always will wipe away the sorrow that I've faced 
 To touch the scars that rescued me from a life of shame 
 And misery this is why this is why I sing

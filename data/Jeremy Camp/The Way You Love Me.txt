All creation cried out with longing 
 With groans only You could comprehend 
 And with wisdom, You always answer 
 And give the words of life so unfailing 
 And Your glory shines all around us 
 Your faithfulness shown for all to see 
 When we think of all of Your wonders 
 The beauty of Your plan that's been revealed 
 We walk in Your light, we walk in it 
 Shine, bright 
 Let Your glory fill this land 
 Lift high, the King of Kings and great I am 
 Jesus, You are the way 
 We can see the works of Your loving hands 
 With a hope and peace not made by man 
 When You poured out Your grace and Your mercy 
 And You held out Your arms so we could see 
 You bled for all mankind and set the captives free 
 Shine, bright 
 Let Your glory fill this land 
 Lift high, the King of Kings and great I am 
 Jesus, You are the way 
 Na na na na na na, Jesus

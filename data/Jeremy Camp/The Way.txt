All Creation cries out with longing 
 With groans only You can comprehend 
 And with wisdom You always answer 
 And give the words of life 
 So unfailing 
 And Your glory shines all around us 
 Your faithfulness shown for all to see 
 When we think of all of Your wonders 
 The beauty of Your plan that's been revealed 
 When we walk in Your light 
 When we walk in it 
 Shine bright 
 Let Your glory fill this land 
 Lift heigh 
 The King of Kings and great I AM 
 Jesus You are The Way 
 You are The Way 
 We can see the works of Your loving hands 
 With the hope and peace not made by man 
 When You poured out Your grace and Your mercy 
 And You held out Your arms 
 So we could see 
 And bled for all mankind 
 You set the captives free, yeah 
 Shine bright 
 Let Your glory fill this land 
 Lift heigh 
 The King of Kings and great I AM 
 Jesus You are The Way 
 You are The Way

 Let Your glory fill this land 
 Lift heigh 
 The King of Kings and great I AM

 Let Your glory fill this land 
 Lift heigh 
 The King of Kings and great I AM 
 Jesus You are The Way

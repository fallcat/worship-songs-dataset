I try to hold on to this world with everything I have, 
 But I feel the weight of 
 What it brings and the hurt that tries to grab. 
 The many trials that seem to never end, 
 His word declares this truth, that we 
 Will enter in His rest with wonders anew. 
 But I hold on to this hope that the promise that He brings, 
 That there will be a place 
 With no more suffering. 
 There will be a day with no more tears, 
 No more pain and no more fears. 
 There will be a day 
 When the burdens of this place will be no more. 
 We'll see Jesus face to face. 
 But until that day we'll hold on to You always. 
 I know the journey seems so long. 
 You feel you're walking on your own. 
 But there has never been 
 A step where you've walked out all alone. 
 Troubled soul, 
 Don't lose your heart 'cause joy and peace He brings, 
 And the beauty that's in store outweighs the hurt of life's sting. 
 But I hold on to this hope that the promise that He brings, 
 That there will be a place 
 With no more suffering. 
 There will be a day with no more tears, 
 No more pain and no more fears. 
 There will be a day 
 When the burdens of this place will be no more. 
 We'll see Jesus face to face. 
 But until that day we'll hold on to You always. 
 I can't wait until that day 
 Where the very One I've lived for always 
 Will wipe away the sorrow that I've faced. 
 Oh, to touch the scars that rescued me 
 From a life of shame and misery. 
 This is why this is why I sing. 
 There will be a day with no more tears, 
 No more pain and no more fears. 
 There will be a day 
 When the burdens of this place will be no more. 
 We'll see Jesus face to face. 
 There will be a day with no more tears, 
 No more pain and no more fears. 
 There will be a day 
 When the burdens of this place will be no more. 
 We'll see Jesus face to face. 
 There will be a day 
 He will wipe away the tears 
 He will wipe away the tears 
 He will wipe away the tears 
 And there will be a day

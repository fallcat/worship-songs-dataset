In only a moment truth was seen 
 Revealed this mystery 
 The crown that showed no dignity He wore 
 And the King was placed for all the world to show disgrace 
 But only beauty flowed from this place 
 Would you take the place of this man 
 Would you take the nails from His hands 
 Would you take the place of this man 
 Would you take the nails from His hands 
 He held the weight of impurity the Father would not see 
 The reasons had finally come to be to show 
 The depth of His grace flowed with every sin erased 
 He knew that this was why He came 
 Would you take the place of this man 
 Would you take the nails from His hands 
 Would you take the place of this man 
 Would you take the nails from His hands 
 And we just don't know 
 The blood and water flowed 
 And in it all He showed just how much He cared 
 And the veil was torn so we could have this open door 
 And all these things have finally been complete 
 Would you take the place of this man 
 Would you take the nails from His hands 
 Would you take the place of this man 
 Would you take the nails from His hands 
 From His hands 
 From His hands 
 From His hands 
 From His hands 
 From His hands

In this time, I know I need to be more broken. 
 Then I find, I feel this passion grow, to face all that's been lost. 
 It's not too late to give control now. 
 I don't know why I wait, You're always calling me. 
 Tonight, I will take my cross. 
 Tonight, I will count this cost. 
 Tonight, I realize You take hold of this very moment. 
 In this time, You draw me by these words You've spoken. 
 I feel inside, this never ending hope. 
 I've placed all that I trust in knowing one day I will see You. 
 The only thing worth holding onto is holding onto me. 
 Tonight, I will take my cross. 
 Tonight, I will count this cost. 
 Tonight, I realize You take hold of this very moment. 
 Oh, I will take this moment. 
 And I feel that it's closer. 
 And I kneel to show You this desperate heart of mine. 
 Tonight, I will take my cross. 
 Tonight, I will count this cost. 
 Tonight, I realize You take hold of this very moment. 
 Tonight, I will take my cross. 
 Tonight, I will count this cost. 
 Tonight, I realize You take hold of this very moment. 
 Tonight, oh, oh 
 Tonight 
 Oh

When I can't see You, 
 I know You're there, 
 When I can't feel You, 
 I will not fear, 
 I will trust in You, 
 And I will not be afraid 
 When the battle, 
 Is close at hand, 
 I know You're with me, 
 To help me stand, 
 I will trust in You, 
 And I will not be afraid 
 I will not, 
 Be afraid, 
 I will not, 
 Be afraid, 
 I will trust in You, 
 I will trust in You, 
 I will trust in You 
 When the darkness, 
 Is close at hand, 
 And I am running, 
 Against the wind, 
 I will trust in You, 
 And I will not be afraid 
 When I'm standing, 
 Upon that shore, 
 All the battles, 
 Have gone before, 
 I will trust in You, 
 And I will not be afraid 
 Cause I will not, 
 Be afraid, 
 I will not, 
 Be afraid, 
 I will trust in You, 
 I will trust in You, 
 I will trust in You 
 I will trust in You 
 I will trust in You 
 I will trust in You, yeah 
 I will trust in You 
 Cause I will not, 
 Be afraid, 
 I will not, 
 Be afraid, 
 Cause I will not, 
 Be afraid, 
 I will not, oh 
 Be afraid, 
 I will trust in You, 
 I will trust in You, 
 I will trust in You 
 I will trust in You 
 I will trust in You 
 I will trust in You

Every time I fall down on my face 
 I see the one who bore all my shame 
 Well, to know that You are everything I need You to be 
 You're my ever present help in time of need 
 I know You understand it all 
 So why don't I get back on my feet again 
 I know You understand it all 
 So why don't I get back on my feet again 
 I know You understand it all 
 Every pain I feel inside my heart 
 It takes a faith I know I can't depart 
 Well, to know that you hear every cry I raise to you 
 Bringing thoughts of hope 
 The words I bring I know are few 
 I know you understand it all 
 So why don't I get back on my feet again 
 I know you understand it all 
 So why don't I get back on my feet again 
 I know you understand it all 
 Will You hear me when I call 
 Will You're there when I fall 
 Will You hear me when I call 
 Will hear me when I call 
 Will there when I fall 
 Will hear me when I call, oh yeah 
 You hear me when I call 
 You hear me when I call 
 I am Yours 
 You hear me when I call 
 You hear me when I call 
 I am Yours 
 So why don't I get back on my feet again 
 I know you understand it all 
 So why don't I get back on my feet again 
 I know you understand it all 
 So why don't I get back on my feet again 
 I know you understand it all

Another day that is lost 
 A moment that I've cost 
 But I can feel Your arms of hope and grace 
 I'm holding on so dear 
 A promise You are near 
 Your loving kindness never fails 
 So take this selfish heart of mine 
 I want to give it all 
 I've wasted too much time 
 And melt away everything that's not of You 
 I want to know You more 
 So much deeper than I do 
 Completely unrestrained 
 I'll give my life away 
 Every single day 
 A price so small for what You gave 
 I'm desperate for You 
 To shape my heart into the very image of what I'm to be 
 So take this selfish heart of mine 
 I want to give it all 
 I've wasted too much time 
 And melt away everything that's not of You 
 I want to know You more 
 So much deeper than I do, oh 
 Take this selfish heart of mine 
 I want to give it all 
 I've wasted too much time 
 Oh, and melt away everything that's not of You 
 I want to know You more 
 So much deeper than I do 
 Completely unrestrained, oh 
 Completely unrestrained, oh 
 Completely unrestrained 
 Completely  unrestrained, Lord 
 I'll give my life away 
 Every single day 
 A price so small for what You gave

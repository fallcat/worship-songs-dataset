Will I believe You when You say 
 Your hand will guide my every way 
 Will I receive the words You say 
 Every moment of every day 
 Well I will walk by faith even when I cannot see 
 Well, because this broken road 
 Prepares Your will for me 
 Well, help me to rid my endless fears 
 You've been so faithful for all my years 
 With the one breath You made me new 
 Your grace covers all I do 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Well, I will walk by faith even when I cannot see 
 Well, because this broken road 
 Prepares Your will for me 
 Well I'm broken but I still see Your face 
 Well You've spoken 
 Pouring Your words of grace 
 Well, I will walk by faith even when I cannot see 
 Well, because this broken road 
 Prepares Your will for me 
 Well, I will walk by faith even when I cannot see 
 Oh, because this broken road 
 Prepares Your will for me 
 Well hallelujah, hallelu 
 (I will walk by faith) 
 Well hallelujah, hallelu 
 (I will walk by faith) 
 Well hallelujah, hallelu 
 (I will walk by faith) 
 Well hallelujah, hallelu 
 (I will walk by faith) 
 Well hallelujah, hallelu 
 (I will walk by faith) 
 Well hallelujah, hallelu 
 (I will walk by faith) 
 I will walk, I will walk, I will walk by faith 
 I will, I will, I will walk by faith

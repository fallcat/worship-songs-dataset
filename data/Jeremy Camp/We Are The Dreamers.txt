I have a dream 
 That the Earth would shake with the sound of Heaven 
 I have a dream 
 That the world would know the kind of freedom 
 That breaks through every chain 
 With every debt erased 
 With hearts that are wide awake 
 We are the dreamers 
 All things are possible 
 You are redeemer 
 You're working miracles 
 Let's rise, rise 
 Rise to our feet 
 And proclaim the name of Jesus 
 I have a dream 
 That hearts for You would thirst and hunger 
 I have a dream 
 We would reach our hands to help our brother 
 Where perfect love is found 
 The world would hear the sound 
 Of hearts that are wide awake 
 I can see the walls are breaking 
 The captives running free 
 We will walk and not be shaken 
 The doubting will believe

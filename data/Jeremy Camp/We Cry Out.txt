Anthems fill the skies with praise 
 All Your mighty works display Your glory 
 They tell of Your glory 
 We who called upon Your name 
 Cannot be silent 
 We will praise 
 We will sing it out, oh 
 We will sing it out 
 For we have seen the greatness of Your glory be revealed 
 And we have seen all that You've done 
 And we can not be still 
 We will cry out to You 
 Your loving kindness and Your truth 
 It has delivered us 
 You have delivered us 
 Great is Your glory Lord 
 When nations learn of Your ways 
 They will bow down to You 
 We will bow down to You 
 Into all the world we take 
 The mystery of Your saving grace 
 Shine the light into the darkness 
 For we have seen the greatness of Your glory be revealed 
 And we have seen all that You've done 
 And we can not be still 
 We will cry out to You 
 Your loving kindness and Your truth 
 It has delivered us 
 You have delivered us 
 Great is Your glory Lord 
 When nations learn of Your ways 
 They will bow down to You 
 We will bow down to You 
 We will cry out to You, oh 
 (Your loving kindness and Your truth) 
 You have delivered us 
 You have delivered us 
 Great is your glory Lord 
 When nations learn of your ways 
 They will bow down to You 
 We will bow down to You 
 We will cry out 
 Great is Your glory Lord (Great is Your glory Lord)

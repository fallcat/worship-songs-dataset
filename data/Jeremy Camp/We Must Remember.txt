We must remember 
 That You have forgotten 
 And You don't remember our sins anymore 
 We must remember 
 That You have forgotten 
 And You, You died once and for all 
 You are the God that bore our shame 
 You are the taker of our pain 
 And we know that You are, yes You are 
 The one true life we need 
 You are the pure and spotless Lamb 
 You are the only Great I Am 
 And we know that You are, yes You are 
 The God of the redeemed 
 And we must remember 
 That You have forgotten 
 And You don't remember our sins anymore 
 And we must remember 
 That You have forgotten 
 And You, You died once and for all 
 Once and for all 
 The power of Your blood is all that we need 
 You laid down Your life and the captives were free 
 The veil was torn and there was victory 
 We must remember, we must remember 
 That You've forgotten, yes You've forgotten 
 We must remember, there is victory 
 There is victory 
 There is victory 
 There is victory 
 We must remember 
 That You have forgotten 
 And You don't remember our sins anymore 
 And we must remember 
 That You have forgotten 
 And You, You died once and for all

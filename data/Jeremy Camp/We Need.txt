Into the heart of the darkest places 
 Into the lost and the lonely spaces 
 Bringing the hope and the life You've given 
 I'll move cause You move me 
 Into the lives of forgotten children 
 Showing the love they were never given 
 Open my eyes to the world I don't see 
 Show me 'cause I know... 
 We need, a heart for the hopeless, reaching 
 The places unspoken, move me Lord 
 Raise up, a desperate people, leading 
 The lost and feeble, use me Lord 
 Use me Lord 
 Give me a fire that's always burning 
 Every desire for You is stirring 
 I am alive now to show Your glory 
 I'll move cause You move me 
 Into the light when Your love is shining 
 Only by faith with Your Spirit guiding 
 Open my eyes to the world I don't see 
 Show me 'cause I know... 
 We need, a heart for the hopeless, reaching 
 The places unspoken, move me Lord 
 Raise up, a desperate people, leading 
 The broken and feeble, use me Lord 
 Here I am, use me Lord 
 We need to wake up 
 We need to raise up 
 'Cause I will never stand still, Lord keep me moving, moving 
 We need, a heart for the hopeless, reaching 
 The places unspoken, move me Lord 
 Here I am, use me Lord 
 Raise up, a desperate people, leading 
 The broken and feeble, use me Lord 
 Here I am, use me Lord 
 We need, a heart for the hopeless, reaching 
 The places unspoken, use me Lord 
 Use me Lord 
 Raise up, a desperate people, leading 
 The broken and feeble, use me Lord 
 Here I am, use me Lord

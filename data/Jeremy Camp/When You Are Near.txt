There's no need to say a thing when I'm before You. 
 In this silence I feel refreshed with peace. 
 Break this noise that binds the voice that tries to speak. 
 Open up my eyes to see Your gracious, sovereign reach. 
 It's hard to talk when I feel that You are near, 
 When all is quiet it's the beauty that I hear. 
 This hidden place where I know that You've calmed my fears. 
 Yes, I know that You've washed my tears. 
 The seasons of change I've faced have never left me wounded. 
 Only scars of hurt, but never deeply rooted. 
 This healing I have felt, no burden can replace. 
 Redemptive hope that has been the story of my pain. 
 It's hard to talk when I feel that You are near, 
 When all is quiet it's the beauty that I hear. 
 This hidden place where I know that You've calmed my fears. 
 Yes, I know that You've washed my tears. 
 All is lost without the breath of life You give, and You give so much. 
 I want nothing more than You, so here's my heart. 
 Here's my heart. 
 It's hard to talk when I feel that You are near, 
 When all is quiet it's the beauty that I hear. 
 This hidden place where I know that You've calmed my fears. 
 Yes, I know that You've washed my tears. 
 Yes, I know that You've calmed my fears. 
 Yes, I know that You've washed my tears.

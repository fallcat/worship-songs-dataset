I'll walk beside You 
 As you lead me through still waters for my soul 
 I place my hope in all You are, yeah 
 And I know You'll guide me 
 To places where there's beauty to behold 
 There's no other place I'd rather be, no 
 'Cause I've been down the other road 
 Where fear and doubt 
 They take control 
 And I won't go there anymore 
 And I won't make a move 
 Without You, whoa 
 I won't make a move 
 Without You 
 Right by my side 
 So I will wait for You 
 To lead me to 
 Any place where You need 
 I won't make a move 
 Without You 
 Without You 
 I've walked through the fire 
 And every step You never left my side 
 In You is where my help comes from, yeah 
 Cause You lead, I'll follow 
 No matter if the place it seems so cold 
 My heart's desire is You Lord, yeah 
 And I've been down the other road 
 Where fear and doubt 
 They take control 
 And I won't go there anymore 
 And I won't make a move 
 Without You, whoa 
 I won't make a move 
 Without You 
 Right by my side 
 And I will wait for You 
 To lead me to 
 Any place where You need 
 I won't make a move 
 Without You 
 Without You 
 And I'm letting go 
 I give You control 
 It's not my will 
 But Yours I'll follow 
 And I lay my life 
 Down at Your feet 
 And I know... 
 I won't make a move 
 Without You, whoa 
 I won't make a move 
 Without You 
 Right by my side 
 And I will wait for You 
 To lead me to 
 Any place where You need 
 I won't make a move 
 Without You 
 Without You 
 Without You 
 Without You 
 Take my heart, it's Yours 
 Your hand, I'll hold 
 You lead, I'll go 
 And I won't make a move, no

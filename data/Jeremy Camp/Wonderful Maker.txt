You spread out the skies over empty space 
 Said, "Let there be light" 
 To a dark and formless world 
 Your light was born 
 You spread out Your arms over empty hearts 
 Said "Let there be light" 
 To a dark and hopeless world 
 Your Son was born 
 You made the world and saw that it was good 
 You sent Your only Son, for You are good 
 What a wonderful Maker 
 What a wonderful Savior 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 And how humble Your love 
 With a strength like no other 
 And the heart of a Father 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 What a wonderful God 
 No eye has fully seen how beautiful the cross 
 And we have only heard the faintest whispers 
 Of how great You are 
 You made the world and saw that it was good 
 You sent Your only Son, for You are good 
 What a wonderful Maker 
 What a wonderful Savior 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 How humble Your love 
 With a strength like no other 
 And the heart of a Father 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 What a wonderful God 
 You made the world and saw that it was good 
 You sent Your only Son, for You are good 
 What a wonderful Maker 
 What a wonderful Savior 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 How humble Your love 
 With a strength like no other 
 And the heart of a Father 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 What a wonderful God 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 What a wonderful God

Word of life 
 Speak to my weary heart 
 Strengthen my broken parts 
 Lead me to Your open arms 
 Word of truth 
 Illuminate all these lies 
 The enemy speaks inside 
 In freedom I will rise 
 'Cause You called me out from the grave 
 So I can live like I've been changed 
 There is a new song in my soul 
 And it begins when I breathe in 
 Your word of life 
 (Your word of life) 
 Spirit of God 
 Take me to a deeper place 
 Take me out of what is safe 
 And I will not be afraid 
 Spirit of God 
 Fill me with joy again 
 Springing up from within 
 It cannot be contained 
 'Cause You called me out from the grave 
 So I can live like I've been changed 
 There is a new song in my soul 
 And it begins when I breathe in 
 Your word of life 
 The old has gone away 
 Only Your love remains 
 I am...

You open our eyes 
 And we see into Your kingdom 
 The promise of grace 
 And You lead us into freedom 
 We're bound in Your love 
 And all sin has been forgotten 
 At the foot of the cross 
 Where our ransom has been given 
 If God is for us who can be against us 
 Who can be against our God 
 Let all your people raise their voices 
 Now as Your glory fills this place 
 Heaven and earth will not be silent 
 For You are the Lord that is Your name 
 Yes You are the Lord that is Your name 
 You give life to us all 
 And you breathe on us Your Spirit 
 We will walk in Your ways 
 As a light unto the nations 
 You go before us Father You protect us 
 Father You provide for us all 
 Let all your people raise their voices 
 Now as Your glory fills this place 
 Heaven and earth will not be silent 
 For You are the Lord that is Your name 
 Yes You are the Lord that is Your name 
 Your name Oh Lord is a rushing wind 
 Your Word is a shelter strong within 
 My portion and my deliverance 
 Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus 
 Let all Your people raise their voices 
 Now as Your glory fills this place 
 Heaven and earth will not be silent 
 For You are the Lord that is Your name 
 Yes You are the Lord that is Your name 
 Well, You are the Lord that is Your name 
 Yes You are the Lord that is Your name

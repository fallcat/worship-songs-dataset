I begin the day with the faith You fashion my ways, 
 And I cannot escape 
 For Your hand it leads. 
 Your right hand holds me. 
 When I wake. 
 You will be there. 
 When the sun goes down in the night. 
 You will be there. 
 My life has been ordained. 
 You have formed this very frame 
 And I am fearfully made. 
 For I was made in that secret place. 
 When I wake. 
 You will be there. 
 When the sun goes down in the night. 
 You will be there. 
 When I wake. 
 You will be there. 
 When the sun goes down in the night. 
 You will be there. 
 How precious are Your thoughts. 
 All over me, oh. 
 They're more than the sands of the sea. 
 When I wake. 
 You will be there. 
 When the sun goes down in the night. 
 You will be there. 
 When I wake. 
 You will be there. 
 When the sun goes down in the night. 
 You will be there. 
 When I wake. 
 You will be there. 
 When the sun goes down in the night. 
 You will be there. 
 You will be there.

History split by sacrifice 
 God's perfect Son gave up his life 
 To ransom back the lost and damned 
 Paying the price, justice demands 
 As He was broken, heaven was opened 
 Our judgment lifted, our sins acquitted 
 His loving kindness freely invites us 
 Into the realms of grace 
 Sing a new song 
 Sing of His goodness, sing of His goodness 
 Sing of His wonderful love 
 True love was shown, true love defined 
 As He was scorned and crucified 
 He tore the veil, bridged the divide 
 Taking us from darkness to light 
 As He was broken, heaven was opened 
 Our judgment lifted, our sins acquitted 
 His loving kindness freely invites us 
 Into the realms of grace 
 Sing a new song 
 Sing of His goodness, sing of His goodness 
 Sing of His wonderful love 
 Sing a new song 
 Sing of His goodness, sing of His faithfulness 
 Sing a new song to the Lord 
 Lift up your voices with all creation 
 Declare His goodness to every nation 
 Release the anthem of heaven here on earth

I want to run away, find a place quiet to pray 
 A place that's lonely where I can find You only 
 The desolate calls, the wide open space 
 Where the noises that drown Your voice dim away 
 And I'm weeping, inundated with love 
 Always I am waiting, and always anticipating Your love 
 It's all my heart can think of 
 Always I am waiting, and wanting to remain in this love 
 It's all I want to drink of 
 Come to me, be not far off, give ear to my words and speak back Your heart 
 There is nothing I want more than this 
 Always I am waiting, and always anticipating Your love 
 It's all my heart can think of 
 And always I am waiting, and wanting to remain in this love 
 It's all I want to drink of 
 Always, always, always waiting for You 
 I'm always, always waiting for You, waiting for You

Lord I've said I want to serve You 
 I've been so eager to love 
 And how I've longed so much to find You, 
 Just to be where You are 
 But it seems I've forgotten 
 Where You are and what You look like 
 I hear Your words speak to me 
 As You remind me again 
 You're (I'm) among the poor 
 You're (I'm) close to the broken 
 The least of these 
 The lowest of the low 
 You're (I'm) among the weak 
 The hungry, the thirsty 
 As I (You) do unto them 
 I've (You've) done unto You (Me) 
 We are Your people, we bear Your name 
 God we claim to seek Your ways 
 But have we neglected Your cries' 
 Have we looked past Your face' 
 See My face, look in My eyes 
 Hear My voice, don't ignore My plight

Here now we're coming 
 Humbly now we're waiting 
 Children in need of daily bread 
 Our storehouses are empty 
 Our burdens are weighty 
 Pain, disease, and strife on every side 
 Father, Father in heaven, in heaven 
 Holy, Holy is Your name, Your name 
 Let Your Kingdom, let Your Kingdom 
 Let it come, Lord, let it come, Lord 
 On earth God, on earth 
 As in Heaven, in Heaven 
 The hungry still hungry 
 The thirsty still thirsty 
 The face of death, it haunts too many eyes 
 Whom else can we look to 
 There is no help but You 
 Your rule and reign is needed on the earth 
 Hear the cry of Your children 
 Your sons and Your daughters 
 Born of Your Spirit 
 To You we cry Abba

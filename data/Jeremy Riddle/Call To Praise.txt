Come all those who heed His call 
 Respond with heart, with body, with all 
 And worship ye the King 
 Come and facedown fall 
 Worship ye the Lord of all 
 Truly we were made to praise the Lord 
 So join with me you saints and Him adore 
 Praise the Lord 
 Come on and 
 Praise the Lord 
 Come all those who know His voice 
 Whose names are in His book, rejoice 
 Get swept up in the flood 
 Caught up in the dance 
 Partake in His most sacred romance 
 Truly we were made to praise the Lord 
 So join with me you saints and Him adore 
 Praise the Lord 
 Come on and 
 Praise the Lord 
 Now, as ever is the time 
 For the Church, the Church to shine 
 Now, as ever is the time 
 To be salt, salt and light 
 So praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Come on and 
 Praise the Lord 
 Oh, praise the Lord 
 Truly we were made to praise the Lord 
 So join with me you saints and Him adore 
 Praise the Lord 
 Come on and 
 Praise the Lord 
 Come worship 
 Lift your voice 
 Praise, praise the Lord 
 Come on church, go

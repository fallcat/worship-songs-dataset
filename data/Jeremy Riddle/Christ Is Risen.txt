Come and see 
 Come and see where they laid Him 
 He is not here 
 He is not here, He is living 
 Quickly now go tell the world 
 Christ, the Lord, He is risen 
 The power of God 
 Forever raised Him from the grave 
 Where oh death' 
 Where oh death is your sting' 
 Swallowed up 
 You're swallowed up in vict'ry 
 Quickly now go tell the world 
 Christ, the Lord, He is risen 
 The power of death 
 Could never hold Him in the grave 
 He is risen, Hallelujah 
 He is risen, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah

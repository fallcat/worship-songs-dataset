I long to know You more rightly 
 I long to see You more clearly 
 Won't You show me more and more of You 
 No longer to simply see in part 
 The fullness of Your grace 
 The wonders of Your heart 
 May I be so bold and ask of You 
 May I ask? 
 Here I am crying 
 Before You I am kneeling 
 I am filled with desperation 
 To be close to You 
 Rend the veil of my confusion 
 All my doubts and disillusions 
 Draw me close and keep me still there 
 In awe of You 
 In awe of You 
 I long to know You more rightly 
 I long to see You more clearly 
 Won't You show me more and more of You 
 No, no longer to simply see in part 
 The fullness of Your grace 
 The wonders of Your heart 
 May I be so bold and ask of You 
 May I ask? 
 And here I am crying 
 Before You I am kneeling 
 I am filled with desperation 
 To be close to You (to be close to You) 
 Rend the veil of my confusion 
 All my doubts and disillusions 
 Draw me close and keep me still there 
 In awe of You 
 In awe of You 
 To see more of You 
 To see much more of You, God 
 I must see more 
 I must see more

Awaken my soul, come awake 
 To hunger, to seek, to thirst 
 Awaken first love, come awake 
 And do as you did at first 
 Spirit of the living god come fall afresh on me 
 Come wake me from my sleep 
 Blow through the caverns of my soul 
 Pour in me to overflow, 
 To overflow 
 Awaken my soul, come awake 
 To worship with all your strength 
 Spirit of the living god come fall afresh on me 
 Come wake me from my sleep 
 Blow through the caverns of my soul 
 Pour in me to overflow, 
 To overflow 
 Come and fill this place 
 Let Your glory now invade 
 Spirit come and fill this place 
 Let Your glory now invade 
 Spirit of the living god come fall afresh on me 
 Come wake me from my sleep 
 Blow through the caverns of my soul 
 Pour in me to overflow, 
 To overflow

May Your voice be louder 
 May Your voice be clearer 
 Than all the others 
 Than all the others 
 May Your face be dearer 
 May Your words be sweeter 
 Than all the others 
 Than all the others in my life 
 Please keep my eyes 
 Fixed on You 
 Please root my heart 
 So deep in You 
 Keep me abiding 
 Keep me abiding 
 Keep me abiding 
 That I, that I may bear fruit 
 May Your presence be truer 
 May Your presence be nearer 
 Than all the others 
 Than all the others 
 May Your light shine brighter 
 May Your love move deeper 
 Than all the others, my God 
 Than all the others in my life 
 Please keep my eyes 
 Fixed on You 
 Please root my heart 
 So deep in You 
 Keep me abiding, yes 
 Keep me abiding 
 Keep me abiding 
 That I, that I may bear fruit 
 Please keep my eyes 
 Fixed on You 
 Please root my heart 
 So deep in You 
 Keep me asking 
 Keep me with You 
 Keep me abiding 
 That I, that I may bear fruit 
 Keep me close 
 Oh, right next to Your heart 
 Right next to Your heart 
 Right next to You

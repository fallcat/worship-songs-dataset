How strong did darkness appear 
 Till His light drew near 
 And shattered the black 
 Putting evil to flight 
 Waking dead hearts to light 
 The Father, revealed 
 All sin, all darkness, all shame 
 It is all washed away no judgment remains 
 For those under His blood His redemption and love 
 He is calling us near No reason left to fear 
 Come let us worship and adore 
 Kneeling lower now before Him 
 Giving glory to the lamb 
 Come let us worship and adore 
 Kneeling lower now before Him 
 Giving glory to the lamb 
 How strong did darkness appear 
 Till His light drew near 
 And shattered the black 
 Putting evil to flight 
 Waking dead hearts to light 
 The Father, revealed 
 Break out in glorious song for the victory is won 
 He has broken apart every prison and shame 
 He has vanquished the grave 
 The good news is clear salvation is here 
 Come let us worship and adore 
 Kneeling lower now before Him 
 Giving glory to the lamb 
 Come and worship Christ the Savior 
 Come with joy and offerings 
 Come and worship Christ the Savior 
 Come adore the King of Kings 
 Come let us worship and adore 
 Kneeling lower now before Him 
 Giving glory to the lamb 
 Come let us worship and adore 
 Kneeling lower now before Him 
 Giving glory to the lamb

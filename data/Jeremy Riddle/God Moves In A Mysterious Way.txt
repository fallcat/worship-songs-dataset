God moves in a mysterious way, yes 
 His wonders to perform 
 He plants His footsteps in the sea 
 And rides upon the storm 
 Deep in unsearchable mines 
 Of never failing skill 
 He treasures up His bright designs 
 And works His sovereign will 
 Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take 
 The clouds you so much dread 
 Are big with mercy and shall break 
 In blessings, yeah, in blessings 
 In blessings on your head 
 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense 
 But trust Him for His grace 
 Behind a frowning providence 
 He hides a smiling face 
 His purposes will ripen fast 
 Unfolding every hour 
 The bud may have a bitter taste 
 But sweet will be the flower 
 Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take 
 The clouds you so much dread 
 Are big with mercy and shall break 
 In blessings, yeah, in blessings, yeah 
 In blessings on your head 
 On your head 
 On your head 
 Blind unbelief is sure to err 
 And scan His work in vain 
 For God is His own interpreter 
 And He will make it plain 
 In His own time 
 In His own way... 
 Yes 
 In His own time 
 In His own way...

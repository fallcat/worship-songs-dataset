Your praise, Your fame 
 My goal, my only aim 
 I've consecrated 
 Myself as fully Yours 
 My body, my heart 
 Are devoted, set apart 
 For Your purpose 
 For Your glory evermore 
 Father, Hallowed be Your name 
 May Your rule and Your reign 
 Take over me 
 For I, I long just to please You 
 To live my life for You 
 To do as You will 
 As each day goes past 
 I seek to hold, to fully grasp 
 Why heaven 
 Has taken hold of me 
 And this end in sight 
 Jesus, Your face heaven's light 
 This prayer 
 Resounds in every part of me 
 Oh, and Father, Hallowed be Your name 
 May Your rule and Your reign 
 Take over me 
 Take over 
 For I, I long just to please You 
 To live my life for You 
 To do as You will 
 With every breath You give 
 Till my death I will live 
 For the One 
 Who has shown me truth by love 
 Oh, by Your love 
 Oh, and Father, Hallowed be Your name 
 May Your rule and Your reign 
 Take over me 
 Take me over 
 For I, I long just to please You 
 God, You know I do 
 To live my life for You 
 To do as You will 
 To do 
 To do as You will

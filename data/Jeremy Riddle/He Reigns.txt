It's the song of the redeemed 
 Rising from the African plain 
 And it's the song of the forgiven 
 Drowning out the Amazon rain 
 The song of Asian believers 
 Filled with God's holy fire 
 It's every tongue, every tribe, every nation 
 A love song born of a grateful choir, yeah 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns 
 Let it rise about the four winds 
 Caught up in the heavenly sound 
 Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals 
 To the faithful gathered underground 
 Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation 
 Some were meant to persist 
 Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples 
 None rings truer than this 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns 
 We give glory to the one and only 
 To the King 
 We give glory 
 Yeah, we give You glory 
 And all the powers of darkness 
 Tremble at what they've just heard 
 'Cause all the powers of darkness 
 Can't drown out a single word 
 And all the powers of darkness 
 Tremble at what they've just heard 
 'Cause all the powers of darkness 
 No, they can't drown out a single word 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns, He reigns 
 It's all God's children singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns 
 He reigns, He reigns 
 Let the earth rejoice 
 Let the people be glad 
 He reigns, He reigns 
 When all God's children sing out 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns, He reigns 
 And all God's people singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns 
 We're singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns, He reigns 
 We're singing singing 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 He reigns 
 Yes, Lord 
 Exalt Him on high 
 Be lifted high, be lifted high 
 We adore You, we adore You 
 Be exalted in this place, Jesus 
 Be worshiped for who You are, Jesus 
 Be exalted in the highest place 
 Be worshiped 
 We stir up our hearts 
 Oh, releasing your praise 
 Releasing a fragrance

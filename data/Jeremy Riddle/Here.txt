I'm here. Here with You 
 Where I'm home, where I'm healed 
 Your name flows from my lips 
 Sweeter than the sweetest kiss 
 How my heart loves Your name 
 It's bursting forth in shouts of praise 
 I feel heaven's drawing near 
 It's close at hand and now is here 
 My heart loves Your name, oh God 
 It's bursting forth in shouts of praise 
 My heart loves Your name, oh God 
 Your name 
 Satan falls like lightning 
 His work undone 
 By my King

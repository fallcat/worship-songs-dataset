He is jealous for me 
 Loves like a hurricane 
 I am a tree 
 Bending beneath 
 The weight of His wind and mercy 
 When all of a sudden 
 I am unaware of these 
 Afflictions eclipsed by glory 
 And I realize how beautiful You are 
 And how great Your affections for me 
 Oh how He loves us so 
 Oh how He loves us 
 How He loves us so 
 How He loves us all 
 Yes, He is jealous for me 
 Loves like a hurricane 
 I am a tree 
 Bending beneath 
 The weight of His wind and mercy 
 When all of a sudden 
 I am unaware of these 
 Afflictions eclipsed by glory 
 And I realize just how beautiful You are 
 And how great Your affections for me 
 And oh how He loves us so 
 Oh how He loves us 
 How He loves us so 
 Oh how He loves us so 
 And oh how He loves us 
 How He loves us so 
 Oh how He loves 
 How deeply the Father loves 
 How deeply Your Father loves 
 How deeply Your Father loves us 
 'Cause He loves us 
 Oh how He loves us 
 Oh how how He loves us 
 Oh how He loves us 
 He loves us 
 Oh how He loves us 
 Oh how He loves us 
 Oh how He loves 
 How He loves 
 Oh, how deeply your Father loves you 
 Behold, behold His love 
 Behold how great His love 
 How great His love 
 Oh how great His love 
 We are His portion 
 And He is our prize 
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes 
 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking 
 So heaven meets earth like a suppulent kiss 
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest 
 Oh I don't have time to maintain these regrets 
 When I think about the way 
 That He loves us 
 Oh how He loves us 
 Oh how He loves us 
 Oh how He loves 
 He loves 
 Oh God so loved this world 
 That He gave, that He gave 
 His only begotten Son 
 That He gave His own Son 
 And oh how He loves us so 
 Oh how He loves us 
 How He loves us so 
 And oh how He loves us so 
 Oh how He loves us 
 How He loves us so

If you could know how many times 
 I've watched you weeping 
 And I've wept the same 
 How I have ached so filled with longing 
 To gather you up here in my arms 
 You're alone, without home and forsaken 
 But I've made a way for you to be Mine 
 For I, I am, I am Redeemer 
 Your Maker, your Healer 
 Your King, who made Himself low 
 That you would discover 
 The love of My Father 
 Made known in Me 
 For every wound you've had to endure 
 I chose to endure it long before you were born 
 I'm offering to carry your burdens and pain 
 Your fear and your worries 
 Your sins and your shame 
 And I'm knocking at your door 
 And I'm waiting 
 For you to let me on the inside 
 You can lay your head on My chest 
 You can feel the warmth of My breath 
 You will know My love 
 You will find rest in Me alone, Me alone

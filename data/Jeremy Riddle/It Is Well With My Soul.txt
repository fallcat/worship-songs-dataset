When peace, like a river, attendeth my way 
 When sorrows like sea billows roll 
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say 
 It is well, it is well with my soul 
 It is well, it is well 
 With my soul, with my soul 
 It is well, it is well, with my soul 
 My sin, o, the joy of this glorious thought 
 My sin, not in part but the whole 
 Was nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more 
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul 
 It is well, it is well 
 With my soul, with my soul 
 Yes, it is well, it is well, with my soul 
 It is well, it is well 
 And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight 
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll 
 The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend 
 Even so, it is well with my soul 
 It is well, it is well 
 With my soul, with my soul 
 It is well, it is well, with my soul

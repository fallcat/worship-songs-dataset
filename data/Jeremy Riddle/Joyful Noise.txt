Raise a voice, make a glorious noise 
 Cry aloud, all in one accord 
 Lift a shout, hail the King above all Kings 
 Sing to God, glory in His Name 
 Hear it rise, all who breathe partake 
 Let it ring! Make His praises glorious! 
 Come and taste, come and see 
 The Lord is good 
 Come awake! Come alive! 
 Worship with trembling 
 Raise a voice, make a glorious noise 
 Cry aloud, all in one accord 
 Lift a shout, hail the King above all Kings 
 Sing to God, glory in His Name 
 Hear it rise, As all who breathe partake 
 Let it ring! Make His praises glorious! 
 Raise a voice, make a noise 
 Cry aloud, lift up a shout! 
 Come with reverence, come with awe 
 For He is God 
 Come engage! Come respond! 
 To His matchless worth

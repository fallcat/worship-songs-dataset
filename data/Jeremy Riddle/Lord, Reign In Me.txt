Over all the earth You reign on high 
 Every mountain stream and every sunset sky 
 But my one request, Lord, my only aim 
 Is that You reign in me again 
 Lord, reign in me, reign in Your power 
 And over all my dreams, and in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again? 
 Won't You reign in me? 
 Over every thought and over every word 
 May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord 
 'Cause You mean more to me than any earthly thing 
 So won't You reign in me again? 
 Lord, reign in me, reign in Your power 
 And over all my dreams, and in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again? 
 Lord, reign in me 
 Over all the earth You reign on high 
 And every mountain stream and every sunset sky 
 But my one request, Lord, my only aim 
 Is that You reign in me again 
 Lord, reign in me, reign in Your power 
 And over all my dreams, and in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again? 
 Lord, reign in me, reign in Your power 
 And over all my dreams, and in my darkest hour 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 So won't You reign in me again? 
 So won't You reign in me again? 
 So won't You reign in me again? 
 Lord, reign in me, Lord

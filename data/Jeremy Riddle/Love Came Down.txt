If my heart is overwhelmed 
 And I cannot hear Your voice 
 I'll hold on to what is true 
 Though I cannot see 
 If the storms of life they come 
 And the road ahead gets steep 
 I will lift these hands in faith 
 I will believe 
 I remind myself of all that You've done 
 And the life I have because of Your Son 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 I am Yours, God, I'm forever Yours 
 Mountain high or valley low 
 I sing out, remind my soul 
 That I am Yours, God, I'm forever Yours 
 When my heart is filled with hope 
 And every promise comes my way 
 When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me 
 Staying desperate for You God 
 Staying humbled at Your feet 
 I will lift these hands and praise, I will believe 
 I am Yours, yes, I am Yours 
 All my days, Jesus, I am Yours

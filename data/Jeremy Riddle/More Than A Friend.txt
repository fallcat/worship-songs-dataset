Just Like Heaven album version and the version on We Welcome You: 
 In the quiet 
 Of my soul 
 In the stillness 
 I hear Your voice call 
 And I am overwhelmed 
 And I am lost for words 
 To describe You 
 Jesus You're more than a friend 
 Jesus You're more than my heart 
 Could ever express 
 Your love and Your grace never fail me 
 Your merciful touch always heals me 
 You bring joy to my soul 
 Joy to my soul 
 My heart longs to worship 
 You my King 
 And I long to bring You 
 A pleasing offering 
 And I am overwhelmed 
 And I am lost for words 
 To describe You

 Jesus You're more than my heart 
 Could ever express 
 Your love and Your grace never fail me 
 Your merciful touch always heals me 
 You bring joy, You bring joy to my soul

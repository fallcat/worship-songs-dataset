This is how I love You 
 I obey Your commands 
 To love truth and love justice 
 And my fellow man 
 To steady the weak 
 And the hungry to feed 
 That Christ might be honored 
 And with me be pleased 
 For this is the love 
 The love You have shown 
 And to love I must echo 
 The love I have known 
 So I will be faithful 
 To love as required 
 A love shown by obedience 
 Lord I'll be obedient 
 This is how I love You 
 Giving as I've received 
 The blessings You've lavished 
 To others in need 
 To care for the poor 
 To free the oppressed 
 To stand for the orphan 
 And the widow to bless 
 For this is the love 
 The love You have shown 
 And to love I must echo 
 The love I have known 
 So I will be faithful 
 To love as required 
 A love shown by obedience 
 Lord I'll be obedient 
 And if I have not love 
 Then I truly have 
 Nothing at all 
 Nothing at all 
 Here now is love 
 The love You have shown 
 And to love I must echo 
 This love I have known 
 So I will be faithful 
 To love as required 
 A love shown by obedience 
 Lord I'll be obedient

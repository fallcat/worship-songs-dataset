Your glory, Lord, is higher than the skies 
 And Your love, the anchor of my life 
 A sound of thanks, all my heart can sing 
 I lift my eyes up to the heavens 
 I fill my heart up with Your praise 
 For You alone have lifted away my chains, yes 
 I just can't keep from laughing 
 And I just can't keep from crying out 
 Jesus Christ has captured my soul, yes 
 I'm bursting with His passion 
 I'm lavished in His grace 
 I am no longer bound by shame, no 
 Have we the Church forgotten who we are? 
 And have we forgotten who we serve? 
 We serve the Almighty Living God 
 Let songs of love come pouring from our hearts 
 Let songs of joy resound both near and far 
 Let's celebrate the goodness of our God, yes 
 We just can't keep from laughing 
 And we just can't keep from crying out 
 Jesus Christ has captured our souls, yes 
 We're bursting with His passion 
 And we're lavished in His grace 
 We are no longer bound by shame, no 
 Oh no, oh no 
 We are no longer bound 
 Yeah, yeah 
 So lift your eyes, lift your hands 
 Lift your feet and praise His name 
 Oh, lift your eyes, lift your hands 
 Lift your feet and praise His name 
 Oh, lift your eyes, lift your hands 
 Lift your feet and praise His name 
 Lift your eyes, Church, lift your hands 
 Lift your feet and praise His name 
 We just can't keep from laughing 
 We just can't keep from crying out 
 Jesus Christ has captured our souls, yes 
 We're bursting with His passion 
 And we're lavished in His grace 
 We are no longer bound by shame, no 
 Oh no, oh no 
 We are no longer bound 
 Yes, thanks to Jesus 
 Praise to Jesus 
 Jesus captured our hearts 
 Jesus captured our hearts 
 Jesus captured our hearts 
 Jesus captured our hearts 
 Jesus

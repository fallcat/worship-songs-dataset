Higher than the mountains that I face 
 Stronger than the power of the grave 
 Constant in the trial and the change 
 One thing... Remains 
 On and on and on and on it goes 
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul 
 And I never, ever have to be afraid 
 One thing remains 
 Your love never fails, never gives up 
 Never runs out on me 
 In death, in life, I'm confident and 
 Covered by, the power of Your great love 
 My debt is paid, there's nothing that 
 Can separate my heart from Your great love

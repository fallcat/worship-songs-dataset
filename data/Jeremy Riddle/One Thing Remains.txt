Higher than the mountains that I face 
 Stronger than the power of the grave 
 Constant through the trial and the change 
 One thing remains 
 This one thing remains 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Because on and on and on and on it goes 
 Before it overwhelms and satisfies my soul 
 And I never, ever, have to be afraid 
 One thing remains 
 This one thing remains 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love 
 In death, and in life 
 I'm confident and covered by the power of your great love 
 My debt is paid, there's nothing that can separate 
 My heart from Your great love 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me, it never fails 
 On and on 
 Your love goes on and on 
 Singing your love 
 Your love goes on and on 
 His love goes on and on 
 Sing it 
 Because on and on and on and on it goes 
 Before it overwhelms and satisfies my soul 
 And I never, ever, have to be afraid 
 This one thing remains 
 This one thing remains 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails me 
 Your grace never fails me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 It's a great love 
 It's a great love 
 Oh, it's a great love 
 Your love, Your love, Your love, Your love 
 It's a great love 
 Your love abounds 
 Your love abounds 
 All this stuff is shadow play 
 Your love, Your love, Your love, Your love 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love never fails, and never gives up 
 It never runs out on me 
 Your love 
 It's still alive in your love 
 Your love, Your love, Your love 
 It's your love, it's Your love 
 It never fails, it never fails, it never fails, it never fails

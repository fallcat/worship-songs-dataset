This one thing I much desire 
 And to this end to never part 
 A devoted and simple life 
 A focus of mind and heart 
 On Jesus, on Jesus 
 I want to know Jesus 
 I must know Jesus 
 My request is not naive 
 Nor made without counting cost 
 The whole of my life is Yours 
 Everything else is lost 
 You can take this world 
 All its lust and lies 
 For I've resolved to know 
 Nothing but Christ and Him crucified 
 I've resolved to know Jesus 
 I want to know Jesus 
 Oh, I want to know You, Jesus 
 I want to know You, Jesus 
 Yes, I want to know

You say to us seek Your face 
 Our hearts reply, Your face we seek 
 Come teach us Lord, reveal Your ways 
 Anoint us for the greater things 
 We have gathered with one thirst and hunger 
 We're here to drink of glory and wonder 
 Here to cry out 
 Come and fill this place 
 This place 
 Come and fill this place 
 Our single wish, our sole desire 
 To gaze upon Your beauty God 
 We will not rest nor will we cease 
 Till with our eyes, Your face we see 
 We have gathered with one thirst and hunger 
 We're here to drink of glory and wonder 
 Here to cry out 
 Come and fill this place 
 This place 
 Come and fill this place 
 Oh this place 
 We wait for you to come and show your glory here today. 
 We wait for you to come and show your glory here today. 
 We wait for you to come and show your glory here today. 
 We wait for you to come and show your glory here today. 
 We wait for you! God, we wait for you! 
 We wait for you! God, we wait for you! 
 Alleluia come 
 Alleluia come 
 Alleluia come 
 Alleluia come! 
 (Repeat) 
 We wait for You to come and show your glory here today! 
 We wait for You to come and show your glory here today! 
 We wait for You to come and show your glory here today! 
 We wait for You to come and show your glory here today!

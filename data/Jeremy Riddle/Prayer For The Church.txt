Where she is weak 
 Strengthen arms now, steady feet 
 That she would care for, she would seek 
 Welcoming Your lost and wounded sheep 
 Coming home to You 
 Where she is stained 
 Bring Your healing, bring Your rain 
 Wash away now her disgrace 
 Till she shines in white, she radiates 
 She now mirrors You 
 (We're praying) 
 No more compromises, no more moral crises 
 Tonight may she move and act as You 
 No more small divisions, no more lack of wisdom 
 Tonight may she move and act as You 
 Where she is right give her courage for the fight 
 Full of salt now, full of light 
 Standing firm where truth and love collide 
 She remains in You 
 Now she's shining 
 Her light is blinding as she sings Your name 
 Now she's beauty 
 Up from the ashes, Your love is on her face 
 Where she is strong, keep her moving, pressing on 
 Bringing justice, righting wrongs 
 Demonstrating now Your Kingdom come 
 She's in step with You

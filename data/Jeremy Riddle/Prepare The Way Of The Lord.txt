Prepare ye the way of the Lord 
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord 
 Oh, the way of the Lord 
 Make straight paths for His feet 
 Clear a way in the streets 
 Prepare your hearts to meet 
 The One who is coming 
 Every valley shall be raised 
 The rough places become plains 
 His salvation comes today 
 To those who would receive Him 
 What His words have foretold 
 All together we'll behold 
 Every knee bending low 
 On the day of His coming 
 Now is a time of urgency 
 You must repent and believe 
 For the day of reckoning 
 Comes with His coming

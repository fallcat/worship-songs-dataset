Gracious and astounding 
 God's love so confounding appears to us 
 In a cleansing flow of blood 
 The Son left throne and glory 
 Bore the Father's wrath and fury 
 In our stead 
 For the sins of all He bled 
 Stand in awe and worship 
 Raise a voice in worship come adore 
 The King of Kings and Lord of Lords 
 Behold the Lamb in Heaven 
 He was dead but God raised Him from the grave 
 For His arm is mighty to save 
 Now glorified and reigning 
 The keys of death and Hades in His hand 
 And all hail the Lord of every man 
 Stand in awe and worship 
 Raise a voice in worship come adore 
 The King of Kings and Lord of Lords, yeah, yeah 
 Stand in awe and worship 
 Raise a voice in worship come adore 
 The King of Kings and Lord of Lords 
 Stand in awe and worship 
 Would you raise a voice in worship come adore 
 The King of Kings and Lord of Lords 
 The King of Kings and Lord of Lords

Whenever I'm low and sinking down 
 When I'm overwhelmed and doubts abound 
 When I've lost all heart and the will to fight 
 When despair sets in and my day is night 
 Lift up my head, make steel my gaze 
 Cast out my fear, move me to faith 
 Surrendered in praise 
 To Your glorious grace, Jesus 
 Whenever I'm tired and I feel alone 
 When oppression mounts and trials come 
 When the father of lies, his arrows fly 
 When there are no answers 
 And my dreams, they die 
 Lift up my head, make steel my gaze 
 Cast out my fear, move me to faith 
 Surrendered in praise 
 To Your glorious grace, Jesus 
 In my heart of hearts where these battles rage 
 My strength it fails and my courage fades 
 In my distress I cry aloud to You 
 You lift my head, and You've steeled my gaze 
 And You've cast out fear, and I'm moved to faith 
 Surrendered in praise 
 To Your glorious grace, Jesus

Sweetly Broken Club Vineyard version: 
 To the cross I look, and to the cross I cling 
 Of its suffering, I do drink, of its work I do sing 
 On it my Savior, both bruised and crushed 
 Showed that God is love and God is just 
 At the cross You beckon me 
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am 
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I 'm 
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered 
 What a priceless gift, undeserved life 
 Have I been given through Christ crucified 
 You've called me out of death 
 You've called me into life 
 And I was under your wrath, now through the cross I'm reconciled 
 And at the cross You beckon me 
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am 
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I 'm 
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered 
 At the cross You beckon me 
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am 
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I 'm 
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered 
 In awe of the cross I must confess 
 How wondrous Your redeeming love and 
 How great is Your faithfulness 
 At the cross You beckon me 
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am 
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I 'm 
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered 
 At the cross You beckon me, yeah 
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am 
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I  am

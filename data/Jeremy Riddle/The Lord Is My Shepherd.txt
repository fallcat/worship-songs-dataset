Lord, My Shepherd: 
 Let the pain, in my life 
 Find it's healing, in Your eyes 
 Every hurt, every loss 
 Pull me closer, to Your heart 
 Let the wind and the waves 
 Bring anew, courage and a faith 
 I'm singing out, singing out... 
 The Lord is my Shepherd and I want for nothing 
 You lead me to water for You know I'm thirsting 
 And I, am only satisfied, by You 
 Every day, I make a choice 
 To be led, only by your voice 
 To be bold and unafraid 
 Knowing I am covered, I am safe 
 For even now, in my need 
 You are proving yet again to me, 
 You are there, You are there, Always there

He grew up right among us 
 No regal form, no majesty 
 Despised and rejected 
 A man whom we did not esteem 
 A man of many sorrows 
 A man acquainted with grief 
 When He came to His own 
 His very own did not receive 
 Not a sound did He utter 
 Not a cry in His defense 
 Though innocent and blameless 
 For He knew why He was sent 
 He embraced the worst of suffering 
 He endured the cross, the nails, the pain 
 That us lost and lowly sinners 
 Would know His love and know His grace 
 Look upon the face of mercy 
 His wounds that bring us peace 
 For God has laid upon His Son 
 The world's iniquity 
 Who will believe this message? 
 Who's been given eyes to see? 
 This man of lowly birth 
 Is Christ your Lord and King 
 Behold His glory, the One and the Only

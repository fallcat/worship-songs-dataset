Holy You are 
 Perfect and pure You are 
 Everything right You are 
 Yes, You are 
 Broken am I 
 Full of discord am I 
 Hungry for change am I 
 Oh, am I 
 Oh, to be like You 
 Oh, to reflect the God I know 
 The love You've shown 
 This is my longing 
 This is my deepest, strongest plea 
 Lord, change me 
 Would You change me? 
 Would You change me? 
 Love You are 
 Spirit and truth You are 
 Everything right/good You are 
 Yes, You are 
 Humbled am I 
 Contrite of spirit am I 
 Open to You am I 
 Oh, am I

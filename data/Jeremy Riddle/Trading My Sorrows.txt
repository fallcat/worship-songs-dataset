I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 And I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 And I'm trading my sickness 
 And I'm trading my pain 
 And I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen 
 I'm pressed but not crushed, persecuted not abandoned 
 Struck down but not destroyed 
 I'm blessed beyond the curse for His promise will endure 
 And His joy's gonna be my strength 
 Though the sorrow may last for the night 
 His joy comes with the morning 
 And I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 And I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord, yeah Lord 
 And I'm trading my sickness 
 And I'm trading my pain 
 And I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 I say, yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen 
 I say now 
 I say yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Amen, Amen 
 And I'm trading my sorrows 
 And I'm trading my shame 
 And I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 For the joy of the Lord, yes 
 And I'm trading my sickness 
 And I'm trading my pain 
 And I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 Your joy, Your, Your joy, Your joy 
 And I'm trading my sorrows 
 And I'm trading my shame 
 And I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord 
 Your joy

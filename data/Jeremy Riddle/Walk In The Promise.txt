Our souls wait in silence 
 In rest and in quiet for You, spirit 
 In trust and dependence 
 We walk in the promise of You coming 
 With hope and healing in Your wings 
 With fire and with wind, You fall on us again 
 Here we are waiting for this house to be shaken 
 For the boldness to carry Your name to the nations 
 Your signs and Your wonders to go now before us 
 For the weight of Your glory to rest as we lift You up 
 We lift You up, be magnified in us

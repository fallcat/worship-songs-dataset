What joy is found 
 In communion with You 
 Beholding Your beauty 
 In knowing Your truth 
 In living a life 
 That pleases Your heart 
 Responding with praises 
 To all that You are 
 (Singing...) 
 Oh, how lovely 
 Is the King in all His glory 
 Is the Christ who is holy 
 Who was and who is 
 And how amazing 
 Is His love so unfailing 
 Is His grace that draws us near 
 What joy is found 
 At the foot of Your throne 
 Bowing in reverence 
 Giving thanks to the One 
 Joining the angels 
 And the heavenly throng 
 Along with the saints 
 In unending song, yeah 
 And oh, how lovely 
 Is the King in all His glory 
 Is the Christ who is holy 
 Who was and who is 
 And how amazing 
 Is His love so unfailing 
 Is His grace that draws us near, yeah, yeah

 And oh, how lovely 
 Is the King in all His glory 
 Is the Christ who is holy, yeah

 Oh, Your grace 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to fall down 
 To seek only Your face 
 Laying down my crown 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to fall down 
 To seek only Your face 
 Laying down my crown

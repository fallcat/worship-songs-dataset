From beginning to the end 
 All my life is in Your hands 
 This whole world may hold me down 
 But it can never drown You out 
 I'm not merely flesh and bone 
 I was made for something more 
 You are God, You're the Great I Am 
 Breath of life I breathe You in 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive in You 
 You are strong in my brokenness 
 Sovereign over every step 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive 
 I'm alive in You 
 Through the dark I hear Your voice 
 Rising up I will rejoice 
 For I was lost but now I'm found 
 'Cause even death can't hold You down 
 You are God, You're the Great I Am 
 Breath of life I breathe You in 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive in You 
 You are strong in my brokenness 
 Sovereign over every step 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive 
 I'm alive in You 
 It's no longer I who live, but Christ 
 Who lives within me, Christ who lives within me 
 From beginning to the end You deserve the glory 
 You deserve the glory 
 It's no longer I who live, but Christ 
 Who lives within me, Christ who lives within me 
 From beginning to the end You deserve the glory 
 You deserve the glory 
 You are God, You're the Great I Am 
 Breath of life I breathe You in 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive in You 
 You are strong in my brokenness 
 Sovereign over every step 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive 
 I'm alive in You 
 You are God, You're the Great I Am 
 Breath of life I breathe You in 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive in You 
 You are strong in my brokenness 
 Sovereign over every step 
 Even in the fire, I'm alive 
 I'm alive in You

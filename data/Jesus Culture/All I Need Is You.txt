Left my fear by the side of the road 
 Hear You speak, won't let go 
 Fall to my knees, as I lift my hands to pray 
 Got every reason to be here again 
 Father's love that draws me in 
 And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You 
 All I need is You 
 All I need is You, Lord, is You, Lord 
 All I need is You 
 All I need is You, Lord, is You, Lord 
 One more day, and it's not the same 
 Your Spirit calls my heart to sing 
 Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again 
 Where would my soul be without Your Son 
 Gave His life to save the earth 
 Rest in the thought that You're watching over me 
 All I need is You 
 All I need is You 
 All I need is You 
 All I need is You 
 You hold the universe 
 You hold everyone on earth 
 You hold the universe 
 You hold, You hold

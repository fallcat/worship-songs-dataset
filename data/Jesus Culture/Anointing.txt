Without Your breath in these lungs 
 I don't have a single song 
 I am lost if I don't have You 
 Without Your word on my lips 
 There is nothing I can give 
 I am lost if I don't have You 
 Holy Spirit, come down 
 I need You now 
 In everything, I need Your anointing 
 Fill me, move in Your power 
 Like oil pour down to my feet 
 I need Your anointing 
 Be the flame, be the spark 
 Be the fire in my heart 
 All I want, all-consuming 
 Be the end, be the start 
 Be the sum of every part 
 All I know, all I'm seeking 
 Holy Spirit, come down 
 I need You now 
 In everything, I need Your anointing 
 Fill me, move in Your power 
 Like oil pour down to my feet 
 I need Your anointing 
 All that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is more of You in me 
 All that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is You 
 Holy Spirit, come down 
 I need You now 
 In everything, I need Your anointing 
 Fill me, move in Your power 
 Like oil pour down to my feet 
 Holy Spirit, come down 
 I need You now 
 In everything, I need Your anointing 
 Fill me, move in Your power 
 Like oil pour down to my feet 
 All that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is more of You in me 
 All that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is more of You in me 
 All that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is You 
 Holy Spirit, come down 
 I need You now 
 In everything, I need Your anointing 
 Fill me, move in Your power 
 Like oil pour down to my feet 
 I need Your anointing 
 Jesus, we need You 
 We need You 
 Come on, God, I need You 
 I need You, Jesus 
 In every area of my life, I need You 
 So pour out Your spirit 
 Here and now, in a fresh way 
 Pour out Your anointing 
 Here and now, in a fresh way 
 Come on, if that's your cry tonight 
 Just lift your hands 
 If you're desperate for a touch 
 If you don't want to do it without Him, come on 
 Jesus, we don't want to do this without You 
 We need You 
 We need Your anointing 
 In our families, in our workplaces, in our relationships 
 Come on 
 God, we need You 
 God, we want You 
 Here and now 
 In this city, in this nation 
 Come on 
 All that really matters, is You, Lord 
 All we're ever after is You 
 You alone satisfy, You alone satisfy 
 Every space in our hearts 
 You alone 
 All that really matters 
 'Cause all that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is more of You in me 
 All that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is more of You in me 
 You alone satisfy 
 You alone have my heart forever 
 You alone, You alone, You alone 
 Come on, one last time, declare it 
 'Cause all... 
 'Cause all that really matters, all I ever need 
 All I'm ever after, is more of You in me 
 You alone

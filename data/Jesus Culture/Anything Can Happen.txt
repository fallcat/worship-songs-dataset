 Anything can happen in this place 
 More than we imagine 
 More than we can fathom 
 Anything can happen in this place 
 Faith is rising, rising up inside 
 Faith is rising, bringing us to life 
 Faith is rising, rising up inside 
 Faith is rising, bringing us to life 
 Healing's falling, falling down like rain 
 Healing's flowing from Emmanuel's veins 
 Healing's falling, falling down like rain 
 Healing's flowing from Emmanuel's veins 
 Come and break addiction 
 Bring us into freedom 
 Give us dreams and visions 
 Let us see Your kingdom 
 Anything can happen in this place

Let our praise be 
 A highway 
 Fill this place 
 Oh King of Glory 
 Touch our cities 
 Fill Your people 
 A new day dawning 
 You are shining like the sun arising 
 You awaken me 
 You awaken me 
 Eyes to see and ears to hear You calling 
 Our hearts respond to Your Spirit falling 
 You're awakening hearts to Your Kingdom 
 Heaven is falling as we are declaring Your name 
 We'll sing aloud with all of our passion 
 King of Glory come and fill this place 
 Let our lives be 
 A pure reflection of You 
 King of Glory 
 Shine Your light on us, Your people 
 A new song rising joined by the sound of Heaven's praise 
 You're awakening 
 You awaken me 
 Eyes to see and ears to hear You calling 
 Our hearts respond to Your Spirit falling 
 You're awakening hearts for Your Kingdom 
 Heaven is falling as we are declaring Your name 
 We'll sing aloud with all of our passion 
 King of Glory come and fill this place 
 Come like You promised 
 Come fall upon us 
 Come like You promised 
 Come fall upon us 
 Come like You promised 
 Come fall upon us 
 Come like You promised 
 Come fall upon us 
 You're awakening hearts for Your Kingdom 
 Heaven is falling as we are declaring Your name 
 We'll sing aloud with all of our passion 
 King of Glory come and fill this place 
 You're awakening hearts for Your Kingdom 
 Heaven is falling as we are declaring Your name 
 We'll sing aloud with all of our passion 
 King of Glory come and fill this place 
 Come like You promised 
 Come like You promised 
 Come like You promised 
 Come like You promised

For every tear, there is a promise 
 A love that never lets me go 
 For every doubt, Your Word speaks louder 
 And I will trust, I will trust in You alone 
 Hands to the sky 
 Heart opened wide 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 All my sin washed away 
 On that glorious day 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 Where there was fear, now there is freedom 
 When I was lost, You made a way 
 Now mercy triumphs over judgement 
 When You rose 
 When You rose up from that grave 
 When You rose 
 When You rose up from that grave 
 Hands to the sky 
 Heart opened wide 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 All my sin washed away 
 On that glorious day 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 Oh, the wonder of it all 
 The King who left His throne 
 From heaven to die for me 
 Now death can't hold me down 
 Your resurrection power 
 Is bursting alive in me 
 Oh, the wonder of it all 
 The King who left His throne 
 From heaven to die for me 
 Now death can't hold me down 
 Your resurrection power 
 Is bursting alive in me 
 Oh, the wonder of it all 
 The King who left His throne 
 From heaven to die for me 
 Now death can't hold me down 
 Your resurrection power 
 Is bursting alive in me 
 Hands to the sky 
 Heart opened wide 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 All my sin washed away 
 On that glorious day 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 Hands to the sky 
 Heart opened wide 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 All my sin washed away 
 On that glorious day 
 I stand in awe 
 I stand in awe of You 
 Oh, the wonder of it all 
 The King who left His throne 
 From heaven to die for me 
 Now death can't hold me down 
 Your resurrection power 
 Is bursting alive in me 
 Oh, the wonder of it all 
 The King who left His throne 
 From heaven to die for me 
 Now death can't hold me down 
 Your resurrection power 
 Is bursting alive in me

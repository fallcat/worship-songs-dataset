From the fullness of our hearts 
 From the depths of who we are 
 Here and now 
 God, be crowned 
 And with every word we sing 
 With a million offerings 
 Here and now 
 God, be crowned 
 From the fullness of our hearts 
 From the depths of who we are 
 Here and now 
 God, be crowned 
 And with every word we sing 
 With a million offerings 
 Here and now 
 God, be crowned 
 Over all the earth 
 Over everything unseen 
 Oh, the majesty 
 Oh, the glory of our King 
 Over all the earth 
 Over everything unseen 
 Oh, the majesty 
 Oh, the glory of our King 
 As we enter in with faith 
 Here, let every life be changed 
 Lost be found 
 God, be crowned 
 What is dead, come back to life 
 Be restored and be revived 
 Darkness bow 
 God, be crowned 
 Over all the earth 
 Over everything unseen 
 Oh, the majesty 
 Oh, the glory of our King 
 Over all the earth 
 Over everything unseen 
 Oh, the majesty 
 Oh, the glory of our King 
 Let our praise move the heart of heaven 
 Here, we invite Your presence in 
 Come and fill this sound 
 Be the source of our endless wonder 
 Here, we exalt no other name 
 Let the song resound 
 Let our praise move the heart of heaven 
 Here, we invite Your presence in 
 Come and fill this sound 
 Be the source of our endless wonder 
 Here, we exalt no other name 
 Let the song resound 
 Over all the earth 
 Over everything unseen 
 Oh, the majesty 
 Oh, the glory of our King 
 Over all the earth 
 Over everything unseen 
 Oh, the majesty 
 Oh, the glory of our King 
 Over all the earth 
 Over everything unseen 
 Oh, the majesty

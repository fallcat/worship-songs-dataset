Oh, Your love reaches to the skies 
 But there's no space between you and I 
 Wherever I go, I'm never alone 
 I'm waking up, I come alive 
 The past is gone, the future can wait 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 I breathe You in, shout out Your praise 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 Your face, brighter than the sun 
 Your grace rewrites every wrong 
 Wherever I go, I'm never alone 
 I'm waking up, I come alive 
 The past is gone, the future can wait 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 I breathe You in, shout out Your praise 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 My past is in the grave 
 My sin is washed away 
 This is Christ in me, this is Christ in me 
 I'm living unashamed 
 Now my heart's forever changed 
 This is Christ in me, this is Christ in me 
 My past is in the grave 
 My sin is washed away 
 This is Christ in me, this is Christ in me 
 I'm living unashamed 
 Now my heart's forever changed 
 This is Christ in me, this is Christ in me 
 The past is gone, the future can wait 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 I breathe You in, shout out Your praise 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 The past is gone, the future can wait 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 I breathe You in, shout out Your praise 
 Oh, my soul, what a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day 
 What a beautiful day

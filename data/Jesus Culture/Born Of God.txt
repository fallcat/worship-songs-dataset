Covered in flesh and blood 
 You came to us 
 Nothing of consequence to see 
 Inside of time and space 
 You laid your life 
 Down on a cross to rescue me 
 Jesus born of God 
 In the flesh 
 I will not forget 
 You live and You died 
 What a love 
 What a sacrifice 
 Silent, You offered up Your body there 
 Numbered with murderers and thieves 
 Bearing the weight of what I never could 
 You stood in my place and set me free 
 O-oh the sacrifice 
 And O-oh the peace 
 You stood in my place and set me free 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel God with us 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel God with us

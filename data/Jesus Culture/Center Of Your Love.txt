Skies are raging the ground is shaking 
 I'm not giving way, the clouds will part again 
 You are sovereign, Lord above the storm 
 I'm not worried, You're right here through it all 
 I know You are for me, I know You are with me 
 The God of more than enough is living inside me 
 I know You are for me, I know You are with me 
 The God of more than enough is living inside me 
 When I'm helpless I can trust that 
 You won't pull back, You're staying through the end 
 When I draw near grace fills the atmosphere 
 Your steadfast presence surrounds me once again 
 Surrounds me once again 
 I know You are for me, I know You are with me 
 The God of more than enough is living inside me 
 I know You are for me, I know You are with me 
 The God of more than enough is living inside me 
 You're always on my side 
 I know and I can trust You 
 You're always, always on my side 
 Oh, when storms are raging 
 You don't change, You don't move, You hold steady 
 You're the rock I cling to, Jesus 
 And when my fear outweighs me 
 You're the love that carries me, You're the love that carries me 
 When I can't find the words to speak 
 You're the voice that stirs up inside of me 
 You're alive inside of me 
 Lord, when my heart is failing 
 You're the fire that roars to life inside of me 
 You roar to life inside of me, God 
 Oh, thank You, thank You for being such a good Father 
 For being such a good Father 
 For being the voice that calls me out, that draws me out 
 Thank You for being the one that says 
 "I know you have it in you, 'cause I'm alive inside you" 
 Thank You for being such a good Father 
 It just makes me want to worship, just makes me want to worship 
 Give You all that I am, give You all that I am, Jesus 
 Hold nothing back from You, hold nothing back from You 
 I want to pour out my heart to You, 
 I want to pour out my heart to You, Jesus 
 Sing every song for You, Jesus, dance every dance for You, Jesus 
 Lift up my hands to You, Jesus 
 Oh, You're such a good father, You're such a good Father 
 You're such a good Father 
 Oh to find me, to save me, to know me, just to love me 
 Thank You, Jesus, thank You, Jesus 
 Oh-oh-ooh...

 I'm made for the center of Your love 
 Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh-ooh 
 I'm made for the center of Your love 
 Oh-oh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh-ooh 
 I'm made for the center of Your love 
 Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh-ooh 
 I'm made for the center of Your love

 Come on just for a moment, just say it right here 
 In your own words, just tell Him "Thank You", thank You 
 And You're with me, You will never leave me 
 You'll never leave me, Jesus 
 Oh-oh-oh-ooh, You're such a good Father 
 You don't disappoint, You never fail me 
 Never let me down, You don't miss a thing

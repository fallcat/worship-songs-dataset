Behold You have come over the hills, upon the mountain 
 To me, You will run 
 My Beloved, You've captured my heart 
 Won't You dance with me 
 Oh, Lover of my soul 
 To the song of all songs? 
 With You I will go 
 You are my Love, You are my Fair One 
 The winter has passed and the springtime has come 
 Won't You dance with me 
 Oh, Lover of my soul, 
 To the song of all songs? 
 Romance me 
 Oh, Lover of my soul 
 To the song of all songs

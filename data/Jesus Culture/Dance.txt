I'm after your heart 
 Why should I be still when the worship starts, Lord 
 I'm so in love with you 
 What can man do, can't hold me back anymore 
 You spin over me 
 And you are pleased when I spend myself on you 
 I'm gonna let go now, really worship 
 Letting my dance come forth 
 Dance, dance 
 Let the Spirit move you 
 Dance, dance 
 Holy Spirit in you

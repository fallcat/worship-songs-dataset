You go before I know 
 That You've even gone to win my war 
 You come back with the head of my enemy 
 You come back and You call it my victory 
 You go before I know 
 That You've even gone to win my war 
 Your love becomes my greatest defense 
 It leads me from the dry wilderness 
 And all I did was praise 
 All I did was worship 
 All I did was bow down 
 All I did was stay still 
 Hallelujah, You have saved me 
 So much better Your way 
 Hallelujah, Great Defender 
 So much better Your way 
 You know before I do 
 Where my heart can seek to find Your truth 
 Your mercy is the shade I'm living in 
 You restore my faith and hope again 
 And all I did was praise 
 All I did was worship 
 All I did was bow down 
 I'm just gonna stay still 
 Hallelujah, You have saved me 
 So much better Your way 
 Hallelujah, Great Defender 
 So much better Your way 
 Hallelujah, You have saved me 
 So much better Your way 
 Hallelujah, Great Defender 
 So much better this way 
 So much better this way 
 So much sweeter this way 
 So much easier this way 
 And when I thought I lost me 
 You knew where I left me 
 You reintroduced me to Your love 
 You picked up all my pieces 
 Put me back together 
 You are the defender of my heart 
 And when I thought I lost me 
 You knew where I left me 
 You reintroduced me to Your love 
 You picked up all my pieces 
 Put me back together 
 You are the defender of my heart 
 And when I thought I lost me 
 You knew where I left me 
 You reintroduced me to Your love 
 You picked up all my pieces 
 Put me back together 
 You are the defender of my heart 
 Hallelujah, You have saved me 
 So much better Your way 
 Hallelujah, Great Defender 
 So much better Your way 
 Hallelujah, You have saved me 
 So much better this way 
 Hallelujah, Great Defender 
 So much better this way 
 So much better this way 
 So much better this way 
 All I did was praise 
 All I did was worship 
 All I did was bow down 
 All I could do is stay still 
 All I could do is stay still 
 All I could do is stay still 
 All I could do is worship 
 All I could do is worship 
 All I could do is worship 
 All we can do is worship 
 Praise will be my breakthrough 
 My song becomes my triumph 
 Worship is my warfare 
 My victory is in you 
 Praise becomes my breakthrough 
 My song becomes my triumph 
 Worship is my warfare 
 Our victory is in You 
 Our victory is in You 
 Praise becomes my breakthrough 
 My song becomes my triumph 
 Worship is our warfare 
 Our victory is in you 
 Our victory is in you 
 Hallelujah, You have saved me 
 So much better this way

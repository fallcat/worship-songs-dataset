Did you feel the mountains tremble 
 Did you hear the oceans roar 
 When the people rose to sing of 
 Jesus Christ, the Risen One 
 Did you feel the people tremble 
 Did you hear the singers roar 
 When the lost began to sing of 
 Jesus Christ, the Saving One 
 And we can see that God You're moving 
 A mighty river through the nations 
 When young and old will turn to Jesus 
 Fling wide your heavenly gates 
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord 
 Open up the doors and let the music play 
 Let the streets resound with singing 
 Songs that bring Your hope 
 Songs that bring Your joy 
 Dancers who dance upon injustice 
 Do you feel the darkness tremble 
 When all the saints join in one song 
 And all the streams flow as one river 
 To wash away our brokenness 
 And we can see that God You're moving 
 A mighty river through the nations 
 When young and old will turn to Jesus 
 Fling wide your heavenly gates 
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord

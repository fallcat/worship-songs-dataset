Humbly I stand, an offering 
 With open hands, Lord I bring 
 Everything and nothing less 
 My best, my all 
 You deserve my every breath 
 My life, my song 
 I surrender, I surrender all 
 Oh, I surrender, I surrender all 
 Lord take control, I trust You 
 I'm letting go, to give You 
 Everything and nothing less 
 My best, my all 
 You deserve my every breath 
 My life, my song 
 I surrender, I surrender all 
 Oh, I surrender, I surrender all 
 Everything and nothing less, I give You 
 Everything and nothing less forever 
 Everything and nothing less 
 Oh, my life is Yours 
 Yours, oh 
 I surrender, I surrender all 
 Oh, I surrender, I surrender all 
 Everything and nothing less 
 My best, my all 
 You deserve my every breath 
 My life, my song 
 I surrender, I surrender all 
 Oh, I surrender, I surrender all

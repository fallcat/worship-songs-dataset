Find me here, Speak to me 
 I want to feel you I need to hear you 
 You are the light That is leading me 
 To the place Where I find peace again 
 You are the strength that keeps me walking 
 You are the hope that keeps me trusting 
 You are the life to my soul 
 You are my purpose, You are everything 
 And how can I stand here with you 
 And not be moved by you 
 Would you tell me how could it be any better than this 
 Cause You're all I want, You're all I need 
 Everything, everything 
 And how can I stand here with you 
 And not be moved by you 
 Would you tell me how could it be any better than this

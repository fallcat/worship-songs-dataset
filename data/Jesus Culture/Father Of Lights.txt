Like a flame, love burned in Your eyes 
 Driving You to pay the greatest price 
 You bought my life, so I could be a light 
 Reflecting You, reflecting love 
 Everything good comes from You 
 Father of Lights 
 Your love will always pierce 
 Through the darkest night 
 Love has a voice, love has a name 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Your love is a light, filling my eyes 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 You bore the weight of death upon Your heart 
 And Your last breath tore the veil apart 
 You made a way for me to walk in grace 
 So I could love you, face to face 
 I will never be the same 
 Love has called my name 
 From the ashes, I rise to proclaim 
 Your love is undefeated 
 Forever You will reign 
 Justice has won again

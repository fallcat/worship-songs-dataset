Before I call 
 Before I ever cry 
 You answer me 
 From where the thunder hides 
 I can't outrun 
 This heart I'm tethered to 
 When every step 
 I collide with You 
 Like a tidal wave 
 Crashing over me 
 Rushing in to meet me here 
 Your love is fierce 
 Like a hurricane 
 That I can't escape 
 Tearing through the atmosphere 
 Your love is fierce 
 You cannot fail 
 The only thing I've found 
 Is through it all 
 You never let me down 
 You don't hold back 
 Relentless in pursuit 
 At every turn 
 I come face to face with You 
 Spoken: 
 Come on, sing it 
 Like a tidal wave 
 Crashing over me 
 Rushing in to meet me here 
 Your love is fierce 
 Like a hurricane 
 That I can't escape 
 Tearing through the atmosphere 
 Your love is fierce 
 You surround me 
 You chase me down 
 You seek me out 
 How could I be lost 
 When You have called me found 
 You chase me down 
 You seek me out 
 How could I be lost 
 When You have called me found 
 You chase me down 
 You seek me out 
 How could I be lost 
 When You have called me found 
 Like a tidal wave 
 Crashing over me 
 Rushing in to meet me here 
 Your love is fierce 
 Like a hurricane 
 That I can't escape 
 Tearing through the atmosphere 
 His love is fierce 
 Your love is fierce 
 You never let go 
 Your love is fierce 
 Even now You surround me 
 Your love is fierce 
 Always, always 
 His love is fierce 
 Spoken: 
 Come on, lift up shouts 
 Great is Your love 
 Great is Your love 
 Great is Your love 
 It never fails 
 It never fails

'Cause I know that You're alive 
 You came to fix my broken life 
 And I'll sing to glorify 
 Your Holy name, Jesus Christ 
 Sing it, You bought - spoken 
 You bought my life with the 
 Blood that You shed on the cross 
 When you died for the sins of men 
 And You let out a cry, crucified, now alive in me 
 These hands are Yours 
 Teach them to serve as You please 
 And I'll reach out desperate to see 
 All the greatness of God 
 May my soul rest assured in You 
 I'll never be the same 
 No, I'll never be the same 
 Sing it, 'cause I know - spoken 
 'Cause I know that You're alive 
 You came to fix my broken life 
 And I'll sing to glorify 
 Your Holy name, Jesus Christ 
 You changed it all, You broke down the wall 
 When I spoke and confessed 
 In You I'm blessed, now I walk in the light 
 In victorious sight of You 
 And I know 
 I'll never be the same 
 No, I'll never be the same 
 Sing it out - spoken 
 Cause I know that You're alive 
 You came to fix my broken life 
 And I'll sing to glorify Your holy name, Jesus Christ 
 And I know 
 'Cause I know that You're alive 
 You came to fix my broken life 
 And I'll sing to glorify 
 Your Holy name, Jesus Christ

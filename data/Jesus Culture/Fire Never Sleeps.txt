I feel the heat rising 
 The flames of my horizon, are at my door 
 I'm staring at the ruins 
 The embers of our brokenness, scattered on the floor 
 This fire never sleeps 
 His fire never sleeps 
 I see that hope is coming 
 So pull me from the ashes, ignite my soul 
 Please, burn away the darkness 
 Cause love is like a furnace 
 Where Your fire never sleeps 
 Burn oh my soul; set me on fire 
 Burn oh my soul; light up the fire 
 Burn oh my soul 
 Stop, I never want to miss You 
 Something new is being born 
 And we were born for this 
 Lord, we know a day is coming 
 When we'll look into Your eyes and see a fire that never sleeps 
 This fire never sleeps 
 This fire never sleeps 
 Burn oh my soul; set me on fire 
 Burn oh my soul; light up the fire 
 Burn oh my soul; Your fire never sleeps 
 Your fire never sleeps 
 Purify my heart 
 Purify my heart 
 Spirit fall on us 
 Spirit fall on us 
 Burn oh my soul; set me on fire 
 Burn oh my soul 
 Burn oh my soul; when You set us on fire 
 Burn oh my soul; light up the fire 
 Burn oh my soul; His fire never sleeps 
 Burn oh my soul; set me on fire 
 Burn oh my soul; light up the fire 
 Burn oh my soul; His fire never sleeps 
 His fire never sleeps 
 Your fire never sleeps 
 Jesus, Your fire never sleeps

Break down the walls, push back the dark 
 Light of the world, move in our hearts 
 There's a stirring in the Spirit, heaven 
 Something holy, can you feel it, heaven 
 Let Your glory and Your power 
 Let Your majesty and worth 
 Flood the earth, flood the earth 
 Let the rumors of Your kingdom 
 Let Your name without reserve 
 Flood the earth, flood the earth 
 Freedom is here, fear has to leave 
 Pain has to go, darkness retreat 
 Every heart here finding healing, heaven 
 In this moment You're revealing heaven 
 Freedom is here, fear has to leave 
 Pain has to go, darkness retreat 
 Heaven flood the earth

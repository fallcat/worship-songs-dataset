Just to know You 
 Is all I'm really after 
 Just to be known by You 
 To behold You 
 And draw a little closer 
 Just to be held by You 
 Just to be held by You 
 Again and again, You have my attention 
 Until the end, You have my affection 
 Forever, I will come 
 For no other reason 
 But You and You alone 
 For no other reason 
 Just to see You 
 To look upon Your beauty 
 I live for this one thing 
 Captivated 
 My heart in awe and wonder 
 I live to see Your face 
 Again and again, You have my attention 
 Until the end, You have my affection 
 Forever, I will come 
 For no other reason 
 But You and You alone 
 For no other reason 
 Again and again, You have my attention 
 Until the end, You have my affection 
 Forever, I will come 
 For no other reason 
 But You and You alone 
 For no other reason 
 You and You alone 
 You are the miracle 
 That makes the seas move 
 And all I need, God 
 I find in You 
 You're every victory 
 You're every breakthrough 
 And all I need, God 
 I find in You 
 You are the miracle 
 That makes the seas move 
 And all I need, God 
 I find in You 
 You're every victory 
 You're every breakthrough 
 And all I need, God 
 I find in You 
 Again and again, You have my attention 
 Until the end, You have my affection 
 Forever, I will come 
 For no other reason 
 But You and You alone 
 For no other reason 
 Again and again, You have my attention 
 Until the end, You have my affection 
 Forever, I will come 
 For no other reason 
 But You and You alone 
 For no other reason... 
 But You and You alone 
 Have my attention 
 Oh, You and You alone 
 Have my deepest devotion 
 Oh, You and You alone 
 Are my hope forever 
 Oh, You and You alone 
 You alone 
 Again and again, You have my attention 
 Until the end, You have my affection 
 Forever, I will come 
 For no other reason 
 But You and You alone 
 For no other reason

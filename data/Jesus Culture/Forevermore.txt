Hope, hope is alive in me 
 For all the world to see 
 That You are good 
 Love, love changes everything 
 Your love has rescued me 
 Now I am Yours 
 You took hold of my life 
 All of my love is Yours 
 All that I have is Yours 
 My soul will praise 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 I come alive in You 
 My soul will shout 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 My joy, It is my joy to sing 
 To bring you an offering 
 For You are good 
 Grace, Your grace 
 Your grace is covering me 
 Saved me and set me free 
 Now I am Yours 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 I am Yours 
 We are dancing 
 We are singing 
 We are coming alive 
 We are dancing 
 We are shouting 
 Set our hearts on fire

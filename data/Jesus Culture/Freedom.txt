Step out of the shadows, step out of the grave 
 Break into the wild and don't be afraid 
 Run into wide open spaces, grace is waiting for you 
 Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Come out of the dark just as you are 
 Into the fullness of His love 
 For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom 
 Let there be freedom 
 Bring all of your burdens, bring all of your scars 
 Come back to communion, come back to the start 
 Run into wide open spaces, grace is waiting for you 
 Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Come out of the dark just as you are 
 Into the fullness of His love 
 For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom 
 Let there be freedom 
 Chains will fall, prisons shake 
 At the sound of Jesus' name 
 Lives made whole, hearts awake 
 At the sound of Jesus' name 
 Chains will fall, prisons shake 
 At the sound of Jesus' name 
 Lives made whole, hearts awake 
 At the sound of Jesus' name 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Come out of the dark just as you are 
 Into the fullness of His love 
 For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom 
 Let there be freedom 
 Let there be freedom 
 Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting for you 
 Dance like the weight has been lifted 
 Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting for you 
 Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting 
 Dance like the weight has been lifted 
 'Cause He did it, yes, He did it 
 Oh, dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom, there is freedom 
 Come out of the dark just as you are 
 Into the fullness of His love 
 For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom 
 Let there be freedom 
 Let there be freedom 
 Let there be freedom

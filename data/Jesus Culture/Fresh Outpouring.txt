Renew us in this day 
 Just like You said You would 
 Your word is not in vain 
 Our hearts reaching heavenward 
 Fresh outpouring 
 Tear the fabric open 
 Come, Jesus come 
 Breath of heaven 
 Nothing left unshaken 
 We long for more 
 We need a fresh outpouring 
 Unleash a fresh outpouring 
 We need a fresh outpouring 
 Unleash a fresh outpouring 
 As temporary fades 
 Let glory invade this earth 
 Your power on display 
 Our eyes looking heavenward 
 Fresh outpouring 
 Tear the fabric open 
 Come, Jesus come 
 Breath of heaven 
 Nothing left unshaken 
 We long for more 
 We need a fresh outpouring 
 Unleash a fresh outpouring 
 We need a fresh outpouring 
 Unleash a fresh outpouring 
 There is fire stirring in our bones 
 A shout is rising, rising up inside 
 Soak the earth, come and fill our hearts 
 Your voice is calling, calling us to life 
 We need a fresh outpouring 
 Unleash a fresh outpouring 
 We need a fresh outpouring 
 Unleash a fresh outpouring 
 Make a way where I see none, no 
 Make a way where I see none, no 
 Let waters rise in the desert 
 Let waters rise in the desert, oh 
 Fresh outpouring 
 Tear the fabric open 
 Come, Jesus come

Hope fills my soul 
 The love that You've shown 
 Brings refreshing like the rain 
 And peace floods my heart 
 I know nothing apart 
 Apart from Your goodness, God 
 You are glorious and you are holy 
 The heavens shout that you are worthy 
 Your love frees my soul 
 And fear has no hold 
 For you have broken the chains 
 And now joy fills my life 
 Your Spirit, Your life 
 I'm undone by the kindness of Christ 
 You are glorious and you are holy 
 The heavens shout that you are worthy 
 At the sound of our praise 
 The heavens will shake and the earth will move 
 You are glorious and you are holy 
 The heavens shout that you are worthy 
 My soul cries out that you are holy 
 The nations shout that you are worthy

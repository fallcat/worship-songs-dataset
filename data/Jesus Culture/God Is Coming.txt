In this moment here I am 
 All I have is in Your hands 
 You stole my heart, so I will wait for You 
 Your fire of love is breaking through 
 The old is gone there's something new 
 You've won my heart, so I will wait for You 
 For my God is coming 
 You can hear the heavens roar 
 Hold on get ready for the glory of the Lord 
 Here He comes running to find me 
 King of the universe 
 Yes, our God is the God who saves 
 Here He comes to light up the darkness 
 Forever glorious 
 Yes, our God is the God who saves 
 In a world that's torn apart 
 Give us courage give us heart 
 Only You can raise the dead to life 
 Take our voices keep us strong 
 Shake the earth with heaven's song 
 Only You can take what's wrong and make it right 
 For my God is coming 
 You can hear the heavens roar 
 Hold on get ready for the glory of the Lord 
 Here He comes running to find me 
 King of the universe 
 Yes, our God is the God who saves 
 Here He comes to light up the darkness 
 Forever glorious 
 Yes, our God is the God who saves 
 Great is the Lord 
 You are Lord 
 God is great

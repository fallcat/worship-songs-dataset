You are matchless in grace and mercy 
 There is nowhere we can hide from Your love 
 You are steadfast, never failing, You are faithful 
 All creation is in awe of who You are 
 You're the healer of the sick and the broken 
 You are comfort for every heart in loss 
 Our King and our Savior forever 
 For eternity we will sing of all You've done 
 For eternity we will sing of all You've done 
 We sing 
 God with us, God for us 
 Nothing can come against 
 No one can stand between us 
 God with us, God for us 
 Nothing can come against 
 No one can stand between us 
 Your heart, it moves with compassion 
 There is life, there is healing in Your love 
 You're the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit 
 For eternity we will sing of all You've done 
 We sing 
 God with us, God for us 
 Nothing can come against 
 No one can stand between us 
 God with us, God for us 
 Nothing can come against 
 No one can stand between us 
 Where there was death, You brought life, Lord 
 Where there was fear, You brought courage 
 When I was afraid, You were with me 
 And You lifted me up, and You lifted me up 
 And You lifted me up, and You lifted me up 
 And You lifted me up, and You lifted me up 
 We sing 
 God with us, God for us 
 Nothing can come against 
 No one can stand between us 
 God with us, God for us 
 Nothing can come against 
 No one can stand between us

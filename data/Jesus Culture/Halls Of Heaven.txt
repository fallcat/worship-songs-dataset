Like thunder speaking from the clouds 
 Your word is always going out 
 Your whisper, I keep following the sound 
 Into Your presence 
 I get caught up, shadows left behind 
 I get caught up, drawn into Your light 
 I get caught up, where Spirit is alive 
 Into Your presence 
 Like a child we come running 
 Through the halls of heaven 
 To the holy of holies 
 Doors are flung wide open 
 Joy is overflowing 
 In the halls of heaven 
 We come running, we come running 
 Through the halls of heaven 
 We come running, we come running 
 Through the halls of heaven 
 Unhindered, all fear is letting go 
 Abandon, a beauty to behold 
 I get caught up, I get caught up 
 I get caught up 
 Face to face with the glory of God 
 And heart to heart with the One that we love 
 We come running, we come running 
 Through the halls of heaven 
 We come running, can't stop running 
 Through the halls of heaven

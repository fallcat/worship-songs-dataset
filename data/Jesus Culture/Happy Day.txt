The greatest day in history, death is beaten 
 You have rescued me 
 Sing it out, Jesus is alive 
 The empty cross, the empty grave 
 Life eternal, You have won the day 
 Shout it all, Jesus is alive 
 He's alive 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 You washed my sin away 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 I'll never be the same 
 Forever I am changed 
 When I stand, in that place 
 Free at last, meeting face to face 
 I am Yours, Jesus You are mine 
 Endless joy and perfect peace 
 Earthly pain finally will cease 
 Celebrate Jesus is alive 
 He's alive 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 You washed my sin away 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 I'll never be the same 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 You washed my sin away 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 I'll never be the same 
 Forever I am changed 
 Oh what a glorious day 
 What a glorious way 
 That You have saved me 
 Oh what a glorious day 
 What a glorious name 
 Jesus! 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 You washed my sin away 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 I'll never be the same 
 Forever I am changed 
 Forever I am changed 
 Oh, what a glorious day 
 What a glorious way 
 That You have saved me 
 And oh what a glorious day 
 What a glorious name 
 Oh what a glorious day 
 What a glorious way 
 That You have saved me 
 And oh what a glorious day 
 What a glorious name 
 Jesus 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 You washed my sin away 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 I'll never be the same 
 Oh happy day, happy day

 And oh happy day, happy day 
 You washed my sin away 
 Oh happy day, happy day

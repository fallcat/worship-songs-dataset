I have heard a sound coming on the wind 
 Changing hearts and mind, healing brokenness 
 I feel a generation breaking through despair 
 I hear a generation full of faith, declare 
 And our song it will be 
 Out of the darkness we will rise and sing 
 He is faithful, He is glorious 
 He is Jesus, all my hope is in Him 
 He is freedom, He is healing right now 
 He is hope and joy, love and peace and life 
 I have seen a light like the break of dawn 
 Giving blind men sight and letting lame men walk 
 I see a generation with resurrection life 
 We are a generation filled with the power of Christ 
 He has paid the highest price 
 He has proven His great love for us 
 We will praise Him with our lives 
 And proclaim our love for Him

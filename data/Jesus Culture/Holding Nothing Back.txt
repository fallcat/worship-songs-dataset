I am chosen, I am free 
 I am Living for eternity 
 Free now forever 
 You picked me up, turned me around 
 You set my feet on solid ground 
 Yours now forever 
 And nothing's gonna hold me back 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 My chains fell off 
 My heart was free 
 I'm alive to live for you 
 I'm alive to live for you 
 Amazing Love, how can it be? 
 You give everything for me 
 You give everything for me 
 Everything 
 You washed my sin and shame away 
 The slate is clean; a brand new day 
 Free now forever 
 Now boldly I approach your throne 
 To claim this crown through Christ my own 
 Yours now forever 
 And nothing's gonna hold me back 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 My chains fell off 
 My heart was free 
 I'm alive to live for you 
 I'm alive to live for you 
 Amazing Love, how can it be? 
 You give everything for me 
 You give everything for me 
 I'm free to live 
 Free to give 
 Free to be 
 I'm free to love you

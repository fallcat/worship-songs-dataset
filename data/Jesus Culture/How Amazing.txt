Where I saw death, there You saw life 
 And You ran to my rescue 
 Can't wrap my head around the cross 
 How far You would go for me 
 The sacrifice, it cut so deep 
 Your wounds are my healing 
 And mercy's cry, so bittersweet 
 The sound brings me to my knees 
 Oh, how amazing, Your love came pouring out 
 Oh, how amazing, the grace that I have found 
 I'm lost in wonder, here I am, undone 
 Oh, how amazing, how amazing... this love 
 Where I felt lost, You called me found 
 Embraced in the Savior 
 I'm not the same, I'll never be 
 Your love changed my destiny 
 Oh, how amazing, Your love came pouring out 
 Oh, how amazing, the grace that I have found 
 I'm lost in wonder, here I am, undone 
 Oh, how amazing, how amazing... 
 Oh, the heights, the depths, of Your great love 
 At the cross, it was finished, Your mercy won 
 Your scars reflect my healing, I stand redeemed 
 The weight of sin is lifted, I'm running free 
 Oh, how amazing, Your love came pouring out 
 Oh, how amazing, the grace that I have found 
 I'm lost in wonder, here I am, undone 
 Oh, how amazing, how amazing... 
 Oh, how amazing, Your love came pouring out 
 Oh, how amazing, the grace that... I have found 
 I'm lost in wonder, here I am, undone 
 Oh, how amazing, how amazing... 
 Oh, how amazing, Your love came pouring out 
 Oh, You poured it out for me, Jesus 
 Oh, You poured Your love out for me, Jesus 
 Oh, the sacrifice for me, Jesus 
 Oh, [I dance?] overwhelmed, Jesus 
 At the gift You gave, the life You gave for me, Jesus 
 It's that love, that changed my destiny 
 It's that love that changed my destiny 
 Oh, it's a love that found me 
 It's a love that found me 
 It's a love that called my name, that draws me out 
 Oh, You're the love that found me 
 Jesus, oh, You changed 
 You changed the course of my life 
 You changed the course of my life 
 Stopped me dead in the tracks and said 
 "Come, follow me," "Come, follow me" 
 You changed my life, such amazing love 
 There's no regret at surrendering all to You, Jesus 
 Oh, there's no regret in giving You my all 
 Holding nothing back, for Jesus 
 A love completely poured out 
 Completely poured out 
 Completely poured out 
 Completely poured out 
 Completely poured out 
 Let me pour out my life, Jesus 
 Let me pour out my life to You, Jesus 
 'Cause You gave it all 
 You gave it all for me, yeah 
 Oh, the heights, the depths, of Your great love 
 At the cross, it was finished, Your mercy won 
 Your scars reflect my healing, I stand redeemed 
 The weight of sin is lifted, I'm running free 
 Oh, how amazing, Your love came pouring out 
 Oh, how amazing, the grace that I have found 
 I'm lost in wonder, here I am, undone 
 Oh, how amazing, how amazing... 
 Oh, how amazing, Your love came pouring out 
 Oh, how amazing, the grace that I have found 
 I'm lost in wonder, here I am, undone 
 Oh, how amazing, how amazing... 
 Oh, how amazing, how amazing... this love

He is jealous for me 
 Loves like a hurricane 
 I am a tree bending beneath 
 The weight of His wind and mercy 
 When all of a sudden 
 I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory 
 And I realize just how beautiful You are 
 And how great Your affections are for me 
 And oh how He loves us 
 Oh, oh how He loves us 
 How He loves us 
 Oh 
 He is jealous for me 
 Loves like a hurricane 
 I am a tree bending beneath 
 The weight of His wind and mercy 
 When all of a sudden 
 I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory 
 And I realize just how beautiful You are 
 And how great Your affections are for me 
 And oh how He loves us 
 Oh, oh how He loves us 
 How He loves us 
 Oh 
 Yeah, He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves 
 Yeah, He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves 
 We are His portion 
 And He is our prize 
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes 
 If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking, ha ha 
 So heaven meets earth like an sloppy wet kiss 
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest 
 I don't have time to maintain these regrets 
 When I think about the way that He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves 
 Yeah, He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves 
 All that love, yeah 
 Oh, how He loves us all 
 Oh, how He loves us all 
 Oh, how He loves us all 
 Oh, how He loves us all 
 Yeah, He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves 
 Yeah, He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us all

No matter what it looks like 
 I just want You, want You 
 In every space of my life 
 I invite You, invite You 
 Like a fire, like a flood 
 Come however You want, however You want 
 With Your power, with Your love 
 Come however You want, however You want 
 You're breaking all the boxes 
 Tearing down the walls, the walls 
 You have no limitations 
 You exceed them all, You exceed them all 
 Faith fills the atmosphere 
 We know that You are here 
 Heaven has come to earth 
 Rebuild every story 
 Release miracles 
 Heaven has come to earth

You found me in the darkness and brought me to light 
 You took my lifeless heart and gave me life 
 Cleanse me from my sin and fill me up 
 With Your Spirit and with Your love 
 Now I'm laughing at the things that once had me bound 
 I'm dancing in the freedom that I found 
 Cause Your love is better than life 
 Lord I long for you more than I ever did before 
 I can't get enough of you 
 'Cause I am in love with You 
 And oh how I long for You 
 'Cause I am in love with You 
 So here I am to worship with open eyes 
 Now I want to live a blameless life 
 'Cause I am finally living at last 
 Give me hope to leave my past 
 I will not keep silent, I will sing out 
 The wonder of God and His great love 
 Everyday my heart is enlarged for You 
 So I will abandon myself to You 
 I can't get enough of you 
 'Cause I am in love with You 
 And oh how I long for You 
 'Cause I am in love with You 
 It burns like a blazing fire 
 Rises like a mighty flame 
 My greatest desire 
 To be seated in love by Your name

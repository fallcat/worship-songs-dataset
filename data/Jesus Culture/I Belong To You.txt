You can be the One that steals my heart 
 With just a simple thought of who You are 
 Let Your light shine in the darkest parts 
 Let Your love fill the world 
 You can be the fire down in my soul 
 That I can't contain, that I can't control 
 Would You fill me up to overflow 
 Let Your love fill the world 
 And I belong to You 
 Forever, I belong to You 
 Let Your words be like a burning flame 
 Come in close to touch my heart again 
 The whole earth trembles at the sound of Your name 
 Let Your love fill the world 
 All I want is more of You 
 Your breath is life, Your word is truth 
 Your glory here is bursting through 
 Let Your love fill the world 
 And You have set my heart on fire 
 My love and my desire 
 Only for You 
 And as Your glory fills this place 
 Your love we will embrace 
 Only for You, for You

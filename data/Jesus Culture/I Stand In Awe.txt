Open my eyes to see more of Your majesty 
 More of Your wonder and Your worth 
 Compel my soul to sing for all eternity 
 Lifting the praise that You deserve 
 I stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 Amazed beyond what I can say 
 I stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 My heart, abandoned once again 
 I stand in awe of You 
 So let Your will resound in every heart that's bowed 
 With every breath in every phrase 
 It's in the angels' sound the universe is loud 
 Full of Your glory and Your grace 
 I stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 Amazed beyond what I can say 
 I stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 My heart, abandoned once again 
 Abandoned to You, amazed by who You are 
 Amazed by all You are 
 Let it rise, let it rise 
 We cannot contain this place inside 
 Let it rise, let it rise 
 Let the sound of heaven multiply oh 
 I stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 Amazed beyond what I can say 
 I stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 My heart, abandoned once again 
 Abandoned to You, amazed by who You are 
 Amazed by all You are 
 We stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 Amazed beyond what we can say 
 I stand in awe of You, in awe of You 
 My heart abandoned once again

There is no love 
 Sweeter than the love You pour on me 
 There is no song 
 Sweeter than the song You sing to me 
 There is no place that I would rather be 
 Than here at You feet, laying down everything 
 All to You, I surrender 
 Everything, every part of me 
 All to You, I surrender 
 All of my dreams, all of me 
 I surrender 
 If worship's like perfume 
 I'll pour mine out on You 
 For there is none deserving of my love like You 
 So take my hand and draw me into You 
 I want to be swept away, lost in love for You 
 No turning back, I've made up my mind 
 I'm giving all of my life this time 
 Your love makes it worth it 
 Your love makes it worth it all

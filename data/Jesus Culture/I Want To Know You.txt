I stand before You, 
 awed by Your majesty 
 Covered by Your mercy 
 Your blood has made me free 
 Draw me to You and set my heart on fire 
 I want to know You 
 You're my one desire 
 I give You my worship 
 All of my passion 
 I give You my whole heart 
 All my devotion 
 Grace never ending 
 Your hands they carry me 
 Body that was broken for all the world to see 
 My heart is held by love so unconditional 
 You captivate me 
 You're the lover of my soul 
 I give You my worship 
 All of my passion 
 I give You my whole heart 
 All my devotion 
 Here I will bow down 
 And say that I need You 
 Here I will worship 
 And say that I love You 
 Oh how I love you 
 Oh how I love you 
 Oh how I love you 
 Oh how I love you 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart 
 I want to know You 
 Let Your spirit overwhelm me 
 Let Your presence overtake my heart

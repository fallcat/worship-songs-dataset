Something in Your eyes 
 Something in Your touch 
 Something in the way 
 That You draw me back to You 
 I was born to worship You 
 I was made to worship You, oh Lord 
 I was born to worship You 
 I was made to worship You, my King 
 I was born to worship You 
 I was made to worship You, my God 
 I was born to worship You 
 I was made to worship You, my Lord

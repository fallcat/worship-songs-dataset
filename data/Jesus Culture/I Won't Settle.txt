What do I look like 
 What do You see 
 What are the things that You are dreaming about me 
 Visions of glory 
 I'm starting to see 
 Lord let the things You've dreamed become reality 
 I won't settle 
 I won't settle for anything less 
 And I will hold on 
 I will hold on for greater things 
 What do I look like 
 What do You see 
 What are the things that You are calling out in me 
 The light of Your Kingdom 
 Is burning in me 
 Lord let the things You've seen become reality 
 Mark me as Yours 
 Set me apart 
 I want everything 
 All that You are

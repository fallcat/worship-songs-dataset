What do you do when you're lost for words? 
 They all fall short, so I just stand in awe 
 Stand in awe of you 
 Melodies come and go 
 You remain, so I stand in awe 
 Stand in awe of you 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, you love me 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, I love you 
 What do you do when God forgives 
 And gives his life so you can live in awe? 
 We live in awe of you 
 Melodies come and go 
 You remain, so I stand in awe 
 Stand in awe of you 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, you love me 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, I love you 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, you love me 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, I love you 
 Holy, holy, we lift up holy hands 
 All for your praise, your honor and glory 
 Holy, holy, we lift up holy hands 
 All for your praise, your honor and glory 
 Holy, holy, we lift up holy hands 
 All for your praise, your honor and glory 
 Holy, holy, we lift up holy hands 
 All for your praise, your honor and glory 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, you love me 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, I love you 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, you love me 
 You reign forever and hold me together 
 And come whatever, I love you 
 I'll sing forever, I'll sing forever 
 I'll sing forever, I love you

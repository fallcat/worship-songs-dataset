There is a river where goodness flows 
 There is a fountain that drowns sorrows 
 There is an ocean deeper than fear 
 The tide is rising, rising 
 There is a current stirring deep inside 
 It's overflowing from the heart of God 
 The flood of heaven crashing over us 
 The tide is rising, rising 
 Bursting, bursting 
 Up from the ground 
 We feel it now 
 Bursting, bursting 
 Up from the ground 
 We feel it now 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 There is a current stirring deep inside 
 It's overflowing from the heart of God 
 The flood of heaven crashing over us 
 The tide is rising, rising 
 Bursting, bursting 
 Up from the ground 
 We feel it now 
 Bursting, bursting 
 Up from the ground 
 We feel it now 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 Break open prison doors 
 Set all the captives free 
 Spring up a well, spring up a well 
 Spring up the well in me 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 Break open prison doors 
 Set all the captives free 
 Spring up a well, spring up a well 
 Spring up the well in me 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river 
 We come alive in the river

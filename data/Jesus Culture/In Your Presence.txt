When Your Spirit rushes in 
 And a holy hush falls on us again 
 It is so far beyond a song 
 It's heaven on earth 
 With our hearts surrendered here 
 Come and breathe on us and change the atmosphere 
 We are in awe of who You are 
 You're heaven on earth 
 In Your presence 
 Mountains sink into the ocean 
 And we stand amazed 
 In Your glory 
 Chains and prison doors are broken 
 Where Your freedom reigns 
 In Your presence 
 In the whisper, I can hear 
 That You love me and there's nothing left to fear 
 No greater love is found within 
 All heaven and earth, heaven and earth 
 In Your presence 
 Mountains sink into the ocean 
 And we stand amazed 
 In Your glory 
 Chains and prison doors are broken 
 Where Your freedom reigns 
 In Your presence 
 This room is alive in Your majesty 
 Our sin it revived in Your mercy 
 Your Son glorified, our arms open wide singing 
 Worthy, You are worthy 
 In Your presence 
 Mountains sink into the ocean 
 And we stand amazed 
 In Your glory 
 Chains and prison doors are broken 
 Where Your freedom reigns 
 In Your presence 
 In Your presence 
 Mountains sink into the ocean 
 And we stand amazed 
 In Your glory 
 Chains and prison doors are broken 
 Where Your freedom reigns 
 In Your presence

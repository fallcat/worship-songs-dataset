I hear Your voice 
 Through the madness all around me 
 I feel You here 
 When my world falls apart 
 As I walk 
 I know You will go before me 
 When I fall 
 I can feel Your hand in mine 
 Oh, You're never too far away, far away 
 Oh, You're only one breath away, breath away 
 Your love is infinite 
 Your love is measureless 
 You won't run out on me 
 You won't run out on me 
 Your love is deep and wide 
 Stretching from sea to sky 
 You won't run out on me 
 You won't run out on me 
 I see Your face 
 In the dawn of every morning 
 I see Your majesty 
 In the stars that fill the night 
 I stand amazed at the wonders of Your glory 
 Even now I can feel Your heart in mine 
 Throughout the age 
 You never change 
 I'm captivated once again 
 Here in Your arms 
 Close to Your heart 
 The King of kings has called me friend

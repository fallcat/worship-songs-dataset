God of justice, love and mercy 
 Pour out Your Spirit over us 
 We are hungry, we are thirsty 
 For the promise of Your kingdom come 
 Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done 
 Let Your kingdom come as we lift You higher 
 As we lift You higher 
 Consuming fire, burn our hearts for 
 The things that burn in Yours 
 We Your church are calling out for 
 The promise of Your kingdom come 
 Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done 
 Let Your kingdom come as we lift You higher 
 As we lift You higher 
 Open up the floodgates of Your love 
 Let the glory of the heavens shine on us 
 Open up the floodgates of Your love 
 Let the King of glory shine over us 
 We call for Your glory 
 Open up, open up 
 Open up, open up, open up the heavens 
 Open up, open up, open up the heavens

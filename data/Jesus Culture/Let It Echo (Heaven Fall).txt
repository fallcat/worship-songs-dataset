We've only scratched the surface 
 And only had just one glance 
 We've tasted of Your glory 
 But there's so much more 
 We're standing on horizons 
 Where earth collides with heaven 
 You're longing for Your children 
 To cry out for more 
 We cry out for more 
 Let it echo from this city 
 To the nations the sound of praise 
 Let the windows of the heavens 
 Open wide and let it rain 
 Here inside Your presence 
 Surrounded by Your Spirit 
 We're satisfied but desperate 
 For even more of You, even more of You 
 Let it echo from this city 
 To the nations the sound of praise 
 Let the windows of the heavens 
 Open wide and let it rain 
 Let it echo from this city 
 To the nations the sound of praise 
 Let the windows of the heavens 
 Open wide and let it rain 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let it echo from this city 
 To the nations the sound of praise 
 Let the windows of the heavens 
 Open wide and let it rain 
 Let it echo from this city 
 To the nations the sound of praise 
 Let the windows of the heavens 
 Open wide and let it rain 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 As we sing 
 Oh-oh 
 Let heaven fall 
 Let heaven fall

I have closed my eyes, I have clenched my fist 
 I have shut my heart, You have opened it 
 I have wandered far away, but You were already there 
 With open arms, with open arms 
 I will let love find me 
 I will let love surprise me 
 I will let love redesign me 
 I will let love 
 I will let love 
 When the waters rise, when the levee breaks 
 When my world starts feeling like an earthquake 
 When Your love starts sinking in, I can see on the waves 
 Your open arms, Your open arms 
 I will let love find me 
 I will let love surprise me 
 I will let love redesign me 
 I will let love 
 I will let love 
 I will let love find me 
 I will let love surprise me 
 I will let love redesign me 
 I will let love 
 I will let love 
 You won't stop, You'll never stop chasing 
 My heart won't stop ever proclaiming 
 Your love for us, there's no containing 
 Your love won't stop, Your love won't stop 
 You won't stop, You'll never stop chasing 
 My heart won't stop ever proclaiming 
 Your love for us, there's no containing 
 Your love won't stop, Your love won't stop 
 Your love won't stop, Your love won't stop 
 Your love won't stop, Your love 
 I will let love find me 
 I will let love surprise me 
 I will let love redesign me 
 I will let love 
 I will let love 
 I will let love find me 
 I will let love surprise me 
 I will let love redesign me 
 I will let love 
 I will let love 
 I will let love find me 
 I will let love surprise me 
 I will let love redesign me 
 I will let love 
 I will let love 
 Oh I will let love 
 I will let love 
 Oh I will let love 
 I will let love 
 I will let love 
 I will let love find me 
 I will let love surprise me 
 I will let love redesign me 
 I will let love 
 I will let love

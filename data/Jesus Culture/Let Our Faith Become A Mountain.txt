You alone are the Healer for the hurting 
 You alone are the Refuge for the broken 
 So strengthen our hearts 
 And let us not grow weary 
 Steady our souls 
 And make us brave in the fire 
 Let our faith become a mountain 
 That will rise and never fall 
 Lifted high above the valley 
 We declare Your kingdom come 
 We will cling to what You've promised 
 Till the day You call us home 
 Let our faith become a mountain we stand on 
 You alone know the end and the beginning 
 You alone see a way when hope is fading 
 So strengthen our hearts 
 And let us not grow weary 
 Steady our souls 
 And make us brave in the fire 
 We will stand unaffected by the chaos 
 We will stand no matter what the cost 
 No more worry, no more fear 
 Every doubt will disappear 
 Let our faith become a mountain 
 That will rise and never fall 
 Lifted high above the valley 
 We declare Your kingdom come 
 We will cling to what You've promised 
 Till the day You call us home

Love came down 
 In flesh you walked among us 
 Bore our sins 
 To death you rose victorious 
 Bursting from the grave you rose 
 Glorious 
 Light of the world 
 Even death could not contain 
 Darkness' spell 
 It was defeated that day 
 Perfect life 
 Shining down upon us 
 We are free 
 In him we are victorious 
 Light of the world 
 Even death could not contain 
 Darkness' spell 
 It was defeated that day 
 He is the light 
 He is risen from the grave 
 All our sins are washed away 
 Light of the world 
 He is the light 
 He's the light of the world 
 He is the light 
 He pulled us from the depths of darkness 
 Brought us into a glorious light 
 He broke the power of sin and freed us 
 Gave his life (Repeat Bridge) 
 Light of the world 
 Even death could not contain 
 Darkness' spell 
 It was defeated that day 
 He is the light 
 He is risen from the grave 
 All our sins are washed away 
 Light of the world 
 He is the light 
 He's the light of the world 
 He is the light 
 He is the light!

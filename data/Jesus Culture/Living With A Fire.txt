 With all that I am, Lord, I give You my heart 
 So let the flame shine brighter 
 Let Your praise sing louder

 When I praise I can feel the darkness trembling 
 All my fear is swept away by perfect love

 Let Your praise sing louder 
 No darkness can stand against this brighter glory 
 His promise is sure, Jesus decides my story 
 No darkness can stand against this brighter glory 
 His promise is sure, Jesus decides my story 
 No darkness can stand against this brighter glory 
 His promise is sure, Jesus decides my story, oh

There's a space in every beating heart 
 There's a longing that reaches past the stars 
 There's an answer to every question mark 
 There's a name 
 There's a hope flowing through these veins 
 There's a voice that echoes through the pain 
 There's an ember ready for the flame 
 There's a name 
 We will fix our eyes on the One who overcame 
 We will stand in awe of the One who breaks the chains 
 Love has a name 
 Love has a name, Jesus 
 Love has a name 
 Love has a name, Jesus 
 There's a joy that triumphs over fear 
 There's a laughter that wipes away all tears 
 There's a presence that changes atmospheres 
 There's a name 
 We will fix our eyes on the One who overcame 
 We will stand in awe of the One who breaks the chains

 The name that shakes the earth and shakes the heavens

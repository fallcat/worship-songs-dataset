Where can I go 
 Where can I run 
 Where Your love doesn't follow 
 Every doubt 
 Every fear 
 Is bowing down to You, Jesus 
 Your love overcomes 
 Your love overcomes 
 Your love overcomes 
 All my hope is in You 
 All my hope is in You 
 We will be singing Your praises in the valley 
 We will be singing Your praises in the victory 
 We believe there is no name above 
 The name of Jesus

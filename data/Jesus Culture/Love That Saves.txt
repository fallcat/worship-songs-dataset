Who can heal the blind man 
 Who can raise the dead 
 Who can part the waters 
 And set my feet on dry land 
 Who secures my future 
 Who forgives my past 
 Who tears the veil of darkness 
 And tramples over death 
 No one, no one but Jesus 
 There is one love 
 One love that saves us, no 
 Who can light the heavens 
 Who can break the night 
 Who can breathe salvation 
 And bring our hearts to life 
 Who hears my every longing 
 Who knows my every need 
 Who provides my healing 
 And sets every captive free 
 No power on earth could ever 
 Stop what You have started 
 No other love could ever take Your place 
 You spoke a word and made a mockery of darkness 
 There is no rival standing in Your way

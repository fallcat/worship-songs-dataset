God from God, light from light 
 We believe in one, Jesus Christ 
 Breaking through the darkest nights to save 
 You alone can save 
 Hope of hope, strength of strength 
 All our sin is dead in the grave 
 Only One has power enough to save 
 You alone can save 
 You alone can save 
 Where there is no way You make a way 
 Where no one else can reach us 
 You find us 
 Where there is no way You make a way 
 Where no one else can reach us 
 You find us 
 Jesus, it's always been You 
 Jesus, it always is You 
 Jesus, it always will be You

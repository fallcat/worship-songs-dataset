One with the Father, one with the Spirit 
 One with the Son of God 
 One with our sister, one with our brother 
 One family by the blood 
 Make us one, make us one 
 Your will be done, make us one 
 One heart with heaven, one mind connected 
 One body unified 
 Bind us together now and forever 
 Jesus be glorified 
 Make us one, make us one 
 Your will be done, make us one 
 Make us one, make us one 
 Your will be done, make us one 
 We confess all our offenses 
 We confess we've been afraid 
 We repent of all our pride 
 Let all the hurt be washed away 
 For all the wars and violence against our enemy 
 Come heal our land with Your great river 
 Restore our family 
 Make us one, make us one 
 Let Your kingdom come and make us one

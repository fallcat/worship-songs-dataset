Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Move upon this place 
 Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Won't you move, in power and grace? 
 Streams of mercy falling down 
 Light of Heaven all around 
 And it's falling to the ground 
 Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Move upon this place 
 Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Won't you move, in power and grace? 
 Spirit fire fan the flame 
 Passion for your Holy name 
 Burning everything 
 Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Move upon this place 
 Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Won't you move, in power and grace? 
 Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Move upon this place 
 Blow, Mighty breath of God 
 Come move, in power and grace? 
 Let Your wind blow 
 Let Your fire fall 
 Let Your wind blow, Your wind blow 
 Let Your fire fall, Your fire fall 
 Let Your wind blow, Your wind blow 
 Let Your fire fall, Your fire fall 
 Let Your wind blow 
 Let Your fire fall 
 Let Your wind blow 
 Let Your fire fall 
 Let Your wind blow 
 Let Your fire fall 
 Let Your wind blow 
 Let Your fire fall

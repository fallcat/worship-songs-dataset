The One who made the blind to see 
 Is moving here in front of me, moving here in front of me 
 The One who made the deaf to hear 
 Is silencing my every fear, silencing my every fear 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles 
 The One who does impossible is 
 Reaching out to make me whole 
 Reaching out to make me whole 
 The One who put death in its place 
 His life is flowing through my veins 
 His life is flowing through my veins 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles 
 The God who was and is to come 
 The power of the Risen One 
 The God who brings the dead to life 
 You're the God of miracles 
 You're the God of miracles 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles 
 The God who was and is to come 
 The power of the Risen One 
 The God who brings the dead to life 
 You're the God of miracles 
 You're the God of miracles 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles 
 I believe in You, I believe in You 
 You're the God of miracles

When You move, darkness runs for cover 
 When You move, no one's turned away 
 Because where You are, fear turns into praises 
 Where You are, no heart's left unchanged 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 When You move, the outcast finds a family 
 When You move, the orphan finds a home 
 Lord, here we are, oh, teach us to love mercy 
 With humble hearts, we bow down at Your throne 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 King of all generations 
 Let every tongue and nation 
 Surrender all to You alone 
 King of all generations 
 Let every tongue and nation 
 Surrender all to You alone (you alone) 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival (Let worship turn into revival) 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 King of all generations 
 Let every tongue and nation 
 Surrender all to You alone 
 King of all generations 
 Let every tongue and nation 
 Surrender all to You alone 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 Back to you Jesus 
 Back to you 
 Back to our first love 
 Back to our first love 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You 
 So come move, let justice roll on like a river 
 Let worship turn into revival 
 Lord, lead us back to You

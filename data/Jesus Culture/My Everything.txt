 You are my everything 
 All I need is in You 
 And all I have 
 All I am is in You 
 It's in You 
 You overflow my heart and soul 
 Wash over me 
 I feel you now 
 Your love surrounds and covers me 
 You are my hearts desire 
 You are the holy fire that burns in me 
 The lover of my soul 
 God, You won't let go 
 You've made Your home in me 
 You are my desire, You are my reward 
 You are my desire, all I'm living for 
 You're all I want, You are everything 
 You are my desire, come and burn in me

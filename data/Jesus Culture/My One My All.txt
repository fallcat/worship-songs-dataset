Just one touch 
 And everything changes, everything changes 
 With one word 
 The world rearranges, the world rearranges 
 By one life 
 Death was defeated, death was defeated 
 And this one love 
 Has paid for my freedom, paid for my freedom 
 No other hope 
 No other love 
 My one, my all 
 Jesus 
 No other god 
 No one above 
 You're all I want 
 Jesus 
 This one King 
 Healer and Savior, my Healer and Savior 
 There's none like 
 The Miracle Maker, You're the Miracle Maker 
 Nothing and no one compares to You, God 
 There's no one like You 
 There's no one like You 
 Just one touch 
 And everything changes 
 Everything changes

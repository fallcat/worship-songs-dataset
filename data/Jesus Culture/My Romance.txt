Look at the way the flowers bloom for You 
 They want to show You their beauty Lord 
 Running waters dance, You and I romance 
 Unto You be all the glory 
 Unto You be all the glory 
 The angels dance around You 
 The earth it sings about You 
 Open up the heavens Lord 
 Let Your Kingdom come to earth 
 My praises all surround you 
 My soul can't dance without you 
 Open up the heavens Lord 
 Let Your kingdom come to earth

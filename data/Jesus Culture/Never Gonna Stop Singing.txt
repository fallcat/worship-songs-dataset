You called us into darkness 
 You reached out to save us 
 You conquered the grave 
 You crossed the divide 
 Lost in our sin 
 You made us alive 
 How can we ever hold it inside? 
 We can't hold back 
 We're gonna lift You higher, higher 
 Hearts burning bright like a fire, fire 
 Voices unite; make it louder, louder 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 Set free, no longer bound in chains 
 You rescued me and called me by name 
 You conquered the grave 
 You crossed the divide; lost in our sin 
 You made us alive 
 How can we ever hold it inside? 
 We can't hold back 
 We're gonna lift You higher, higher 
 Hearts burning bright like a fire, fire 
 Voices unite; make it louder, louder 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 We're never gonna stop 
 Higher, higher 
 Hearts burning bright like a fire, fire 
 Voices unite; make it louder, louder 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 Every tribe, every tongue, every heart will sing 
 Every knee, we will bow to the Risen King 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 Ooh we're never gonna stop 
 Every tribe, every tongue, every heart will sing 
 Every knee, we will bow to the Risen King 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 Ooh we're never gonna stop 
 Higher, higher 
 Hearts burning bright like a fire, fire 
 Voices unite; make it louder, louder 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 We're never gonna stop 
 Higher, higher 
 Hearts burning bright like a fire, fire 
 Voices unite; make it louder, louder 
 We're never gonna stop the singing 
 We're never gonna stop the singing

You breathe and Your light shines in 
 You speak and my fears grow dim 
 Every word burning deep within 
 I am overwhelmed again 
 I am overwhelmed again 
 You never stop singing Your love to me 
 You never stop singing Your love to me 
 For the rest of my days 
 Let me ever be listening 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You 
 Your voice is a rushing wind 
 No force could ever stand against 
 You are strong but it's effortless 
 I am overwhelmed again 
 I am overwhelmed again 
 You never stop singing Your love to me 
 You never stop singing Your love to me 
 For the rest of my days 
 Let me ever be listening 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You 
 It's never changing, never failing 
 Your love makes a way 
 It's always searching, always speaking 
 Your love stays the same 
 It's never changing, never failing 
 Your love makes a way 
 It's always searching, always speaking 
 Your love stays the same 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You 
 To Your I love yous 
 'Cause I love You

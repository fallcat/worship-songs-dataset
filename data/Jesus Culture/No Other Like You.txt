You were innocent and condemned 
 Broken and You bore our sins 
 Laid Your life down 
 Through the sacrifice of Your son 
 The power of death was overcome 
 Laid Your life down on the cross 
 There's no other like You, nothing compares to Your great Love 
 Highly exalted, forever seated on the throne 
 We stand in awe of You, We stand in awe of You 
 Nothing else compares God 
 We stand in awe of You 
 By the blood of Christ, we boldly come 
 All of heaven welcomes us 
 Lord we thank You for the cross 
 There's no other like You, nothing compares to Your great Love 
 Highly exalted, forever seated on the throne 
 There's no other like You, nothing compares to Your great Love 
 Highly exalted, forever seated on the throne 
 We stand in awe of You, We stand in awe of You 
 Nothing can compare God 
 We stand in awe of You 
 We will exalt You 
 Forever, forever

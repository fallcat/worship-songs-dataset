I have this confidence because 
 I've seen the faithfulness of God 
 The still inside the storm, the promise of the shore 
 I trust the power of Your word 
 Enough to seek Your Kingdom first 
 Beyond the barren place, beyond the ocean waves 
 When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome 
 When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid 
 You keep the promises You make 
 There isn't one that is delayed 
 So I will not lose heart, here, I will lift my arms 
 And start to sing into the night 
 My praise will call the sun to rise 
 Declare the battle won, declare that it is done 
 When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome 
 When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid 
 When I am in the fire, I will not feel the flame 
 I'll stand before the giant, declaring victory 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid 
 Before me, behind me, always beside me 
 No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me 
 No, I am not afraid 
 Before me, behind me, always beside me 
 No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me 
 No, I am not afraid 
 I am not afraid 
 When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome 
 When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid 
 When I am in the fire, I will not feel the flame 
 I'll stand before the giant, declaring victory 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid 
 No fear with You, Jesus 
 I can stand with confidence and sing 
 You're the One who always saves the day, Jesus 
 You never let me down, no 
 No place for fear, no place for worry 
 I stand in Your confidence and I know 
 I know You are the One who has me, who holds me 
 You go before me, You prepare the way in front of me, Jesus 
 Guiding every step along the way 
 You are the One who goes before me 
 You are the One who stands behind me 
 You are the One that's all around me, surrounding me, Jesus 
 I know, I can trust You, Jesus, yeah 
 Before me, behind me, always beside me 
 No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me 
 No, I am not afraid 
 Before me, behind me, always beside me 
 No shadow, no valley, where You won't find me 
 No, I am not afraid 
 I am not afraid 
 When I walk through the waters, I won't be overcome 
 When I go through the rivers, I will not be drowned 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid 
 When I am in the fire, I will not feel the flame 
 I'll stand before the giant, declaring victory 
 My God will make a way, so I am not afraid

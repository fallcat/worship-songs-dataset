What can I do with my obsession? 
 With the things I cannot see 
 Is it madness in my being? 
 Is it wind that blows the trees? 
 Sometimes you're further than the moon 
 Sometimes you're closer than my skin 
 And you surround me like a winter fog 
 You've come and burned me with a kiss 
 And my heart burns for you 
 And my heart burns

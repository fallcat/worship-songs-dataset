Father in heaven 
 You know my longing 
 You hear my every 
 Thought and prayer 
 I bring you 
 My heart 
 And all my affection 
 I long to love You 
 To love You with all that I have 
 To give to You all that I am 
 Oh how I love You 
 Bow down before You now 
 God I adore You 
 Worship before You, lay my life down 
 You are my Refuge 
 The one that I run to 
 I find my strength in You alone 
 I know you are with me 
 Here in this moment 
 Teach me to love You 
 To love You with all that I have 
 To give to You all that I am 
 Oh how I love You 
 Bow down before You now 
 God I adore You 
 Worship before You, lay my life down 
 I live my life for one thing 
 Poured out as an offering 
 An offering of worship 
 To lay my life down 
 I live my life for one thing 
 Poured out as an offering 
 An offering of worship 
 I give to you now 
 Oh how I love You 
 Bow down before You now 
 God I adore You 
 Worship before You, lay my life down 
 Oh How I love You 
 God I adore You, God I adore, God I adore

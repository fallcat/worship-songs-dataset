Higher than the mountains that I face 
 Stronger than the power of the grave 
 Constant through the trial and the change 
 One thing... Remains (repeat) 
 Your love never fails, never gives up 
 Never runs out on me (3x) 
 On and on and on and on it goes 
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul 
 And I never, ever, have to be afraid 
 One thing remains 
 In death, In life, I'm confident and 
 Covered by the power of Your great love 
 My debt is paid, there's nothing that can 
 Separate my heart from Your great love>

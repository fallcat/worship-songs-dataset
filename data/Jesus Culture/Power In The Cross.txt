We all stand amazed 
 In awe of amazing grace 
 The divide has been erased, we thank You 
 All sin is washed away. You alone have saved the day 
 We are forever changed, we thank You 
 Let every heart, every tongue 
 Come sing of Your redemption 
 There's power in the Cross 
 Where You proved Your love 
 The only sacrifice strong enough to save us 
 You rose in victory to let the whole world 
 See Love has made a way 
 Hope is never lost 
 There's power in the Cross 
 No we are made alive 
 In freedom like a fire 
 Burning with one desire we thank You 
 We will spend all our lives 
 Filled with the hope of Christ 
 Who paid the final price, we thank You 
 There's power in the Cross 
 Where You proved Your love 
 The only sacrifice strong enough to save us 
 You rose in victory to let the whole world 
 See Love has made a way 
 Hope is never lost 
 There's power in the Cross 
 Strong enough to save us 
 Strong enough to save us 
 Strong enough to save, strong enough to save 
 There's power in the Cross 
 Where You proved Your love 
 The only sacrifice strong enough to save us 
 You rose in victory to let the whole world 
 See Love has made a way 
 Hope is never lost 
 There's power in the Cross

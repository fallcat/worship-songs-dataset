Strip everything away till all I have is you 
 Undo the veils so all I have is you 
 Strip everything away till all I have is you 
 Undo the veils so all I have is you 
 I will pursue you, I will pursue your presence 
 I will pursue you, I will pursue your presence 
 Open my eyes, search me inside 
 I can't live without your presence 
 I can't live without your presence 
 I'm pressing into you, so do not pass me by 
 I'm breaking through the boundaries, I will not be denied 
 I will pursue you, I will pursue your presence 
 I will pursue you, I will pursue your presence 
 Open my eyes, search me inside 
 I can't live without your presence 
 I can't live without your presence

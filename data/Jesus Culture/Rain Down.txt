Looks like tonight, the sky is heavy 
 Feels like the winds are gonna change 
 Beneath my feet, the earth is ready 
 I know its time for heaven's rain, it's gonna rain 
 'Cause its living water we desire to flood our hearts with holy fire 
 Rain down, all around the world we're singing 
 Rain down can you here the earth is singing 
 Rain down all around your people singing 
 Rain down rain it down on me. 
 Back to the start, my heart is heavy 
 Feels like its time, to dream again 
 I hear Your voice, and yes I'm ready 
 To live the life to sing Your song, to sing Your song 
 Yes I belong 
 Rain down, all around the world we're singing 
 Rain down can you here the earth is singing 
 Rain down all around your people singing 
 Rain down rain it down on me. 
 Give me strength to cross the water 
 Keep my heart upon the altar 
 Rain, rain it down on me. 
 Give me faith to render heaven

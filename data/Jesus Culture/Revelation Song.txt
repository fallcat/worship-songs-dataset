 Holy, Holy, is He 
 Sing a new song 
 To Him who sits on 
 Heaven's mercy seat 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord God Almighty 
 Who was, and is, and is to come 
 With all creation I sing 
 Praise to the King of Kings 
 You are my everything 
 And I will adore You 
 Clothed in rainbows of living colour 
 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder 
 Blessing and honour, strength and 
 Glory and power be 
 To You the only wise king 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord God Almighty 
 Who was, and is, and is to come 
 With all creation I sing 
 Praise to the King of Kings 
 You are my everything 
 And I will adore You 
 I'm filled with wonder 
 Awestruck wonder 
 At the mention of Your Name 
 I'm filled with wonder 
 Awestruck wonder 
 At the mention of Your Name 
 I'm filled with wonder 
 Awestruck wonder 
 At the mention of Your Name 
 Jesus, Your Name is Power 
 Breath, and Living Water 
 Such a marvellous mystery

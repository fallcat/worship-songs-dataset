Here I am before You 
 Falling in love and seeking Your truth 
 Knowing that Your perfect grace 
 Has brought me to this place 
 Because of You I freely live 
 My life to You, oh God, I give 
 So I stand before You, God 
 I lift my voice cause You set me free 
 So I shout out Your name 
 From the rooftops I proclaim 
 That I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 All the good You've done for me 
 I lift up my hands for all to see 
 You're the only one 
 Who brings me to my knees 
 To share this love across the earth 
 The beauty of Your holy worth 
 So I kneel before You, God 
 I lift my hands cause You set me free 
 So I shout out Your name 
 From the rooftops I proclaim 
 That I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 All that I am 
 I place into Your loving hands 
 And I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 Here I am

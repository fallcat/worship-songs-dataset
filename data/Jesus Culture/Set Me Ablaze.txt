Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 Till it's all that I know 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 So I'll never grow cold 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 May Your fire start 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 Keep me burning 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 May Your fire start 
 Come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart, oh 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 With a single obsession 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 With an endless passion 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 May Your fire start 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 Keep me burning 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 May Your fire start 
 Come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart, oh 
 Your fire, burn brighter 
 Deep inside my heart 
 Consume me, reach through me 
 I want all You are 
 Your fire, burn brighter 
 Deep inside my heart 
 Consume me, reach through me 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 Till it's all that I know 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 So I'll never grow cold 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 May Your fire start 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 Keep me burning 
 Breathe, come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart 
 May Your fire start 
 Come and breathe 
 On the coals of my heart, oh

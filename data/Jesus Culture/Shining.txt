You guide me through the dark 
 You calm My fearful heart 
 And I will rest in you 
 You give me perfect peace 
 Fulfill my deepest need 
 And I will rest in you 
 God Shining Like the sun 
 Let your kingdom come 
 I want to be with you in your presence 
 I'm here to give you praise 
 You take my breath away 
 And now I'm here with you in your presence 
 Your kindness draws me in 
 Know I'm with once again 
 I will rest in you 
 My God who reign on high 
 To you alone I cry 
 And I will rest in you 
 You are shining, you are shining 
 Your light surrounds me, your light has found me

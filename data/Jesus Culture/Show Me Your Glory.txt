I see the cloud, I step in 
 I want to see Your glory as Moses did 
 Flashes of light and rolls of thunder 
 I'm not afraid 
 I'm not afraid 
 Show me Your glory, show me Your glory, my God... 
 Show me Your glory, show me Your glory 
 I'm marked by Your beauty, lost in Your eyes 
 I want to walk in Your presence like Jesus did 
 Your glory surrounds me and I'm overwhelmed 
 I'm not afraid 
 I'm not afraid 
 Show me Your glory, show me Your glory, my God... 
 Show me Your glory, show me Your glory, yeah! 
 I long to look on the face of the One that I love 
 Long to stay in Your presence, it's where I belong 
 Oh how we love You, oh how we love You 
 Oh how we love You, Jesus

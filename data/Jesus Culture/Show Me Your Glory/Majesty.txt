Show me your glory 
 Majesty, Majesty 
 Your grace has found me just as I am 
 Empty handed but alive in your hands 
 Majesty, Majesty 
 Forever I am changed by your love 
 In the presence of your Majesty 
 Singing Majesty, Majesty 
 Forever you changed me 
 Just one glimpse, one taste of love 
 And I stare straight into the eyes 
 That burn with love for me 
 The most beautiful eyes I've ever seen 
 And everything inside of me just wanted to give 
 All I am, all my love to you my beautiful King 
 Forever, forever you changed me 
 There is no love like you God 
 There is no love greater 
 There is no love greater, God 
 There is no one like you 
 Forever your are King in my heart God 
 Forever you are King in my heart Jesus 
 Forever you reign in my life 
 Forever

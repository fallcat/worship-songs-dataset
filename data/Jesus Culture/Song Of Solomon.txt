Over the mountains 
 Over the sea 
 Here You come running 
 My Lover to me 
 When I feel the cold of winter 
 And this cloak of sadness, I need You 
 All the evil things that shake me 
 All the words that break me, I need You 
 Over the mountains 
 Over the sea 
 Here You come running 
 My Lover to me 
 Do not hide me from Your presence 
 Pull me from Your shadows, I need You 
 Beauty wrap Your arms around me 
 Sing Your song of kindness I need You 
 Over the mountains 
 Over the sea 
 Here You come running 
 My Lover to me 
 All through the valleys 
 Through the dark of night 
 Here You come running 
 To hold me till it's light 
 I'll come running 
 Come running 
 Come running, back to You

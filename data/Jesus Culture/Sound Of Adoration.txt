When we were lost ones 
 You were the Shepherd that carried us home 
 When we were prodigals 
 You ran to meet us with open arms 
 And we can't hold back our praise 
 When we were refugees 
 You were the One who took us in 
 When we were enemies 
 You paid the price for our sin 
 And we can't hold back our praise 
 This is the sound of adoration 
 Oh how we love You 
 Jesus, we love You 
 You are the joy of all creation 
 Oh, we love You 
 Jesus, we love You 
 You are the Risen One 
 You conquered death and made a way 
 You sang our freedom song 
 Now we are dancing on our chains 
 And we can't hold back our praise 
 This is the sound of adoration 
 Oh how we love You 
 Jesus, we love You 
 You are the joy of all creation 
 Oh, we love You 
 Jesus, we love You 
 By the cross I am free 
 Your grace changes everything 
 I was blind, now I see 
 Your grace changes everything 
 By the cross I am free 
 Your grace changes everything 
 I was blind, now I see 
 Your grace changes everything 
 Everything

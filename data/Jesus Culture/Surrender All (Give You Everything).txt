All to Jesus I, I surrender all 
 All to Him I freely give 
 I will ever love, and trust Him with my heart 
 In His presence daily live 
 I surrender all, to Jesus Christ my King 
 I surrender everything 
 Oh, I surrender all, my hopes and all my dreams 
 I surrender all, and give You everything 
 All to Jesus I, I surrender all 
 Humbly at His feet I bow 
 Pleasures of this world, I would gladly trade 
 Take it all Lord, take me now 
 All to Jesus I, I surrender all 
 Oh to feel thy sacred flame 
 Love's salvation born, filling us with joy 
 Glory, glory to His Name 
 All to Jesus, I surrender 
 All to Jesus, I surrender all

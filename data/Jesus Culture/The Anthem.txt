I can hear the footsteps of my King 
 I can hear His heartbeat beckoning 
 In my darkness He has set me free 
 And now I hear the Spirit calling me 
 He's calling 
 Wake up child 
 It's your time to shine 
 You were born for such a time as this 
 I can hear a holy rumbling 
 I've begun to preach another King 
 Losing chains and breaking down the walls 
 I want to hear the Father when He calls 
 He's calling 
 Wake up child 
 It's your time to shine 
 You were born for such a time as this 
 This is the anthem of our generation 
 Here we are God 
 Shake our nation 
 All we need is Your love 
 You captivate me 
 I am royalty 
 I have destiny 
 I have been set free 
 I'm gonna shape history 
 I'm gonna change the world

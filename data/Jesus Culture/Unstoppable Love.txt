Try to stop your love and you would wage a war 
 Try to stop the very thing you gave your life for 
 You would come running you'd tear down every wall 
 All the while you're shouting my love you're worth it all 
 God you pursue me with power and glory 
 Unstoppable love that never ends 
 Your unrelenting with passion and mercy 
 Unstoppable love that never ends 
 You broke into the silence 
 And sang a song of hope 
 A melody resounding in the deep of my soul 
 You have come running you tore down every wall 
 All the while you're shouting my love you're worth it all 
 God you pursue me with power and glory 
 Unstoppable love that never ends 
 Your unrelenting with passion and mercy 
 Unstoppable love that never ends 
 Oh 
 No sin 
 No shame 
 No past 
 No pain 
 Can separate me from your love 
 No height 
 No depth 
 No fear 
 No death 
 Can separate me from your love 
 No sin 
 No shame 
 No past 
 No pain 
 Can separate me from your love 
 No height 
 No depth 
 No fear 
 No death 
 Can separate me from your love 
 Oh Your Love 
 God you pursue me with power and glory 
 Unstoppable love that never ends 
 Your unrelenting with passion and mercy 
 Unstoppable love that never ends 
 There is no end to your love 
 No end to your love 
 It goes on forever 
 Love that calls my name 
 Love that knows my name 
 Love that knows my heart 
 Yeah. 
 No sin 
 No shame

 No past 
 No pain 
 Can separate me from your love 
 No height

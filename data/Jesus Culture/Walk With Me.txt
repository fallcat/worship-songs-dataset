Author of the world, walk with me 
 Ruler of the earth, walk with me 
 Calmer of the storm, walk with me 
 Healer of my heart, walk with me 
 How I need You 
 How I need You 
 Oh Jesus, walk with me 
 Light for every step, walk with me 
 Giver of each breath, walk with me 
 How I need You 
 How I need You 
 Oh Jesus, walk with me 
 How I love You 
 How I love You 
 Oh Jesus, walk with me 
 In Your presence Lord there is peace, there is rest 
 In Your presence Lord there is life that never ends 
 In Your presence Lord there is joy there is joy 
 In Your presence Lord there is life that never ends

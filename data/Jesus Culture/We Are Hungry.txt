Lord I want more of You 
 Living Water rain down on me 
 Lord I need more of You 
 Living Breath of Life come fill me up 
 We are hungry, we are hungry 
 We are hungry for more of You 
 We are thirsty, oh Jesus 
 We are thirsty for more of You 
 Lord I want more of You 
 Holy Spirit rain down on me 
 Lord I need more of You 
 Living Breath of Life come fill me up 
 We lift our holy hands up 
 We want to touch You 
 We lift our voices higher 
 And higher and higher to You

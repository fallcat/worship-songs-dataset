Oh Lord we cry out, we've been lost 
 We need your mercies oh God 
 We repent for our sin and we turn to you again 
 Oh Lord we cry out, we've been lost 
 Change our hearts to yours oh God 
 We repent for our ways and we turn to you again 
 And we turn to you 
 Oh God we cry out for your mercy 
 Oh God we cry out for your grace 
 Oh God we cry out, set us free 
 Oh God we cry out, once again 
 Once again

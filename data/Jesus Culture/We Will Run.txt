We will run to you 
 Give everything to you 
 We will run to you 
 Lord, your heart 
 Is full of love and mercy 
 Lord, your blood poured out 
 You were broken for us 
 We remember the price you paid 
 On the cross 
 Your love is calling 
 Love is calling 
 We will run to your arms 
 Give everything to you 
 We will run to you 
 Leave our past at the cross 
 Surrendered before you 
 We will run to you 
 Lord, your eyes 
 They blaze 
 They are all consuming 
 God, our hearts 
 Are yours 
 They burn for you only 
 We remember the price you paid 
 On the cross 
 Your love is calling 
 Love is calling 
 We will run to your arms 
 Give everything to you 
 We will run to you 
 Leave our past at the cross 
 Surrendered before you 
 We will run to you 
 With every heart 
 With all we are 
 We give you praise 
 We give you praise 
 We give you praise 
 We give you praise 
 You are our savior 
 You are our savior 
 You are our savior 
 We will run to your arms 
 Give everything to you 
 We will run to you 
 Leave our past at the cross 
 Surrendered before you 
 We will run to you 
 We will run to you 
 We will run to you!

From the ends of the Earth we hear this song 
 Glory to the Righteous One 
 From the ends of the Earth we hear this song 
 Glory to the Righteous One 
 From the ends of the Earth we hear this song 
 Glory to the Righteous One 
 From the ends of the Earth we hear this song 
 Glory to the Righteous One 
 We will sing the song that awakens the dawn 
 And we will usher in your appearing 
 It's your face that we crave 
 It's your presence that we long for 
 Your Kingdom come 
 We will sing the song that awakens the dawn 
 And we will usher in your appearing 
 It's your face that we crave 
 It's your presence that we long for 
 Your Kingdom come 
 And with your seal upon my heart 
 It's stronger than the grave 
 Jealous, ablaze

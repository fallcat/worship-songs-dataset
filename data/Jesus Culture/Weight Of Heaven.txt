Fill this room 
 Fill this place 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Fill our hearts 
 Fill our praise 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Let the weight of heaven fall 
 Let it rain on us, downpour 
 Can you hear the waters roar 
 Let the weight of heaven fall 
 Move in power 
 Have Your way 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Move in power 
 Have Your way 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Come and meet us face to face 
 Saturate our hearts 
 Fill us up to overflowing 
 Saturate our world 
 We are ready, we are ready 
 Saturate our hearts 
 Fill us up to overflowing 
 Saturate our world 
 We are ready, oh 
 Have Your way 
 Have Your way 
 Have Your way

 Jesus only did 
 What He saw You do 
 He would only say 
 What He heard You speak 
 He would only move 
 When He felt You lead 
 Following Your heart 
 Following Your Spirit 
 How could I expect to walk without You 
 When every move that Jesus made was in surrender 
 I will not begin to live without You 
 For You alone are worthy 
 You are always good 
 You are always good 
 Oh, yes 
 You are always good 
 Always good 
 Always good 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

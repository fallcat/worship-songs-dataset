Lord we come to You 
 Come to You (oh) 
 With our hearts wide open 
 With our hands wide open 
 All our love, wide open 
 Open for You, open for You 
 Where else would we go, what would we do, who would we turn to 
 For we know that You hold, Words of life So we come to You 
 With our hearts wide open 
 With our hands wide open 
 All our love, wide open 
 Open for You, open for You 
 Just as we are we come with open hands and open hearts

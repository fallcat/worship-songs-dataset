And I like to bring glory to You, King 
 God of victory, You are my passion 
 It's in the way You are, You don't change at all 
 Great and humble God, You are my passion 
 My strength in life is I am Yours 
 My soul delights because I am Yours 
 Your will on earth is all I'm living for 
 Jesus, I glorify; Jesus, my love is Yours 
 You are my heart's desire; I live to know You more 
 Light that breaks the darkness, showing what true love is 
 Always full of goodness, You are my passion 
 You never do me wrong, the meekest Man, but strong 
 The most perfect song, You are my passion

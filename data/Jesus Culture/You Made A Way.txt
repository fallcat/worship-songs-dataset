You've made a way for me 
 To enter the Holy Place 
 You've made a way for me 
 To enter the Holy Place 
 I am Yours 
 You are mine 
 And we'll be 
 Together, forever 
 You've made a way for me 
 To enter the Holy Place 
 You've made a way for me 
 To enter the Holy Place 
 I am Yours 
 You are mine 
 And we'll be 
 Together, forever

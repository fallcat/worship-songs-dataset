In the Heavens on the Earth 
 There is no one like You God 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of who You are 
 Who can know the mind of God? 
 Who can understand your ways? 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of your great name 
 Take the world but give me You 
 All I want is You 
 Take the world but give me You 
 All I want is You 
 All I want is You 
 Take the world but give me You 
 All I want is You

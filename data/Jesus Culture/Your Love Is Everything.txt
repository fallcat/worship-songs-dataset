Just sing when I'm dry - spoken 
 When I am dry and thirsty Lord, 
 And I'm crying out for more, 
 I know I can trust in Your love. 
 In the darkness - spoken 
 In the darkness in the night 
 When I'm starving for the light 
 I know I can trust in Your love 
 Let's sing that again - spoken 
 When I am dry and thirsty Lord, 
 And I'm crying out for more, 
 I know I can trust in Your love. 
 In the darkness in the night 
 When I'm starving for the light 
 I know I can trust in Your love 
 And You keep - spoken 
 You keep no record of my sin, 
 You don't remember all my shame. 
 Sing it out, Your love - spoken 
 Your love heals every disease 
 Your love fulfills my every need 
 Your love is everything to me 
 Your love is everything 
 Your love heals every disease 
 Your love fulfills my every need 
 Your love is everything to me 
 Your love is everything

What to say, Lord? 
 It's You who gave me life 
 And I can't explain just how 
 Much You mean to me now 
 That You have saved me, Lord 
 I give all that I am to You 
 That everyday I could 
 Be a light that shines Your name 
 Everyday, Lord 
 I'll learn to stand upon Your word 
 And I pray that I 
 I might come to know You more 
 That You would guide me 
 In every single step I take that 
 Everyday I can 
 Be Your light unto the world 
 Everyday, it's You I live for 
 Everyday, I'll follow after You 
 Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord

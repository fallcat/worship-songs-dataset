I'm done 
 Building my own kingdom 
 No more 
 Seeking worthless idols 
 Like sheep we have all gone astray 
 We must choose this day 
 Whom we will serve 
 As for me and my house 
 We will serve the Lord 
 We will serve the Lord 
 Idols raised, tear them down 
 'Cause we will serve the Lord 
 We will serve the Lord 
 To one king we bow down 
 As for me and my house 
 We will only serve the Lord 
 I'm done 
 With powerless religion 
 No more 
 Living in deception 
 As for me and my house 
 We will serve the Lord 
 We will serve the Lord 
 Idols raised, tear them down 
 'Cause we will serve the Lord 
 We will serve the Lord 
 To one king we bow down 
 As for me and my house 
 We will only serve the Lord 
 We will cross over Jordan 
 We will claim what you promised 
 As for me and my house 
 We will serve the Lord 
 We will serve the Lord 
 Idols raised, tear them down 
 'Cause we will serve the Lord 
 We will serve the Lord 
 To one king we bow down 
 As for me and my house 
 We will only serve the Lord 
 We will not give our hearts to another 
 Will not give our hearts to another 
 We belong to the Lord 
 We will not give our hearts to another 
 Will not give our hearts to another 
 We will only serve the Lord

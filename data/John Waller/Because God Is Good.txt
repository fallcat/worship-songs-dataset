God is good, God is good 
 God is good, God is good 
 God is good, [Incomprehensible] God created 
 God is good, God is good 
 There is just one thing I've got to pass along 
 'Cause I know that it will help you 
 In the journey you are on 
 You see, I've learned from disappointment 
 And in all my broken dreams 
 That God in all His mercy is looking out for me 
 'Cause in the heart of a man 
 He makes his plans 
 But the Lord directs his step 
 When life doesn't go the way I thought it should 
 Sometimes it's because God is good 
 And when plans fall apart 
 Though I never dreamed they would 
 Sometimes it's because God is good 
 It's a sure thing I will stand and state my claim 
 That all things work together 
 For my good in Jesus name 
 And every disappointment 
 And in all my broken dreams 
 God in all His mercy is looking out for me 
 'Cause in the heart of a man 
 He makes His plans 
 But the Lord directs his step 
 When life doesn't go the way I thought it should 
 Sometimes it's because God is good 
 And when plans fall apart 
 Though I never dreamed they would 
 Sometimes it's because God is good 
 I've been desperate 
 ('Cause God is good) 
 And I've been broken 
 ('Cause God is good) 
 And I've been humbled 
 ('Cause God is good) 
 But never forsaken 
 ('Cause God is good) 
 I stand on the mountain 
 ('Cause God is good) 
 Restored and forgiven 
 ('Cause God is good) 
 And I'm changed forever 
 ('Cause God is good) 
 'Cause God is good 
 (God is good) 
 He's always good 
 (Always good) 
 When life doesn't go the way I thought it should 
 Sometimes it's because God is good 
 And when plans fall apart 
 Though I never dreamed they would 
 Sometimes it's because God is good 
 Thank You, Father, Your ways are higher 
 And You are always good 
 Thank You, Father, Your ways are higher 
 And You are always good

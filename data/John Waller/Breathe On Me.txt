Hover over me 
 Fill me spirit, breathe on me 
 I want to walk in signs and wonders 
 I want to speak with tongues of angels 
 Breathe on me 
 Sprit I receive 
 Empower me to be your witness 
 Rest on me and Jesus let me see 
 Even greater things than these 
 When you breathe 
 Let me bind up the broken hearted 
 I want the world to see your power 
 I believe, I receive everything you have for me

Flood every corner of this room 
 Flood all the emptiness with You 
 Lord I long to be consumed 
 And I'm calling for a flood 
 So flood every chamber of my heart 
 Flood what I lack with all You are 
 I am dry and I am parched 
 And I'm calling for a flood 
 I am calling for a flood 
 Holy spirit fall completely immerse me in you 
 I'm longing for a flood 
 A holiness to wash me now 
 Hear me Lord I'm calling for a flood 
 Now flood every coner of my mind 
 And flood everything I'm trying to hide 
 I'm looking to the sky 
 And calling for a flood 
 I am calling for a flood 
 Holy spirit fall completely immerse me in you 
 I'm longing for a flood 
 A holiness to wash me now 
 Hear me Lord I'm calling for a flood 
 Submerge me in You in Holy water 
 Enthralled me to live in you 
 And flood every corner of this room 
 And fill all the emptiness with You 
 Lord we long to be consumed 
 And we're calling for a flood 
 We are calling for a flood 
 Holy spirit fall completely immerse us in You 
 We're longing for a flood 
 A holiness to wash us now 
 Hear us Lord we're calling for 
 Holiness 
 We call upon Holiness 
 So flood this place with holiness 
 You are holy 
 Lord immerse us in your 
 Holiness 
 We call upon Holiness 
 So flood this place with holiness 
 You are holy 
 Hear us lord we're calling for a flood 
 We're calling for a flood 
 Hear us lord we're calling for a flood

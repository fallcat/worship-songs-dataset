I was walking on water just a week ago 
 Not a care in the world even a day ago 
 Not sure what happened but all of the sudden 
 I saw the crashing waves all around me 
 And once again I had to choose to put my eyes back on You 
 My eyes back on You 
 And You said cling to the call 
 Cling to the peace that guards your heart 
 Cling to the promise though you stumble you won't fall 
 I will uphold you now just trust me with all 
 Just look at me and I will lead you as you cling to the call, yeah, oh 
 I could stand without wavering just an hour ago 
 I could not deny You even a moment ago 
 I'm not sure what happened but three times denied You 
 And once again I've gotta choose to put my eyes back on You 
 My eyes back on You 
 And You said cling to the call 
 Cling to the peace that guards your heart 
 Cling to the promise though you stumble you won't fall 
 I will uphold you now just trust me with all 
 Just look at me and I will lead you as you cling to the call, yeah 
 Now once again I trust You're leading me 
 I choose to lean not on my understanding Lord 
 And I will sing as I cling to the call 
 Cling to the peace that guards your heart 
 Cling to the promise though you stumble you won't fall 
 I will uphold you now just trust me with all things 
 Just look at me and I will lead you as you cling to the call 
 Cling to the call 
 Cling to the peace that guards your heart 
 Cling to the promise though you stumble you won't fall 
 I will uphold you now just trust me with all things 
 Just look at me and I will lead you as you cling to the call 
 Cling to the call, yeah

All I've got, all I am 
 All my dreams, all my plans 
 I'm holding back 
 I'm holding nothing back from You 
 All I've got, all I am 
 All my dreams, all my plans 
 I'm holding back 
 I'm holding nothing back from You 
 I surrender it all 
 I lay it before You 
 For all of my days 
 I'll give You the glory 
 I count it all as loss 
 I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You 
 My God 
 I count it all as loss 
 I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You 
 My Lord, my God 
 All I've got, all I am 
 All my dreams, all my plans 
 I'm holding back 
 I'm holding nothing back from You 
 I surrender it all 
 I lay it before You 
 For all of my days 
 I'll give You the glory 
 I count it all as loss 
 I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You 
 My God 
 I count it all as loss 
 I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You 
 My Lord, my God 
 I surrender it all 
 I lay it before You 
 For all of my days 
 I'll give You the glory 
 You caused me to see 
 My heart is divided 
 Lord, take all of me 
 'Cause I have decided 
 I count it all as loss 
 I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You 
 My God 
 I count it all as loss 
 I count it all as loss 
 Compared to knowing You 
 My Lord, my God, yeah

I am a dead man sure as I'm living 
 I am a dead man though I am breathing 
 I'm dead and gone, this is my song 
 I'm a dead man walking 
 Singing I am crucified with Christ 
 No longer I live, now the life in me is only in Him 
 I am seated with Christ, I'm not coming back 
 All my life I've never been so alive 
 I am crucified, I'm crucified 
 Now every day my reason for living 
 Is now in dying, my life surrender 
 I'm dead and gone, this is my song 
 I'm a dead man walking 
 Singing I am crucified with Christ 
 No longer I live, now the life in me is only in Him 
 Now I am seated with Christ, I'm not coming back 
 And all my life I've never been so alive 
 I am crucified 
 If we try to save our lives we will lose them, we will lose them 
 If we lay them down and die we will find them 
 By grace through faith in Christ alone 
 Come and sing the dead man's song 
 No longer I live, now the life in me is only in Him 
 Now I'm seated with Christ, I'm not coming back 
 All my life I've never been so alive 
 I am crucified, I am crucified, I am crucified 
 I'm a dead man walking 
 I am crucified, I am crucified, I am crucified 
 I'm a dead man singing

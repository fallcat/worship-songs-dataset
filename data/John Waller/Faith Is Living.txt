I wish I could see just three steps in front of me 
 But the lamp unto my feet, it only moves when I take a step 
 And believe Your word to me, Lord You have a history 
 That proves You're worthy of my faith 
 It's the evidence of things I cannot see 
 And faith it's the confidence that You are holding me 
 It's stepping out, it's breaking through all my doubts 
 And all I thought I knew 'cause you've never lived until you've lived 
 You've never lived until you've lived by faith 
 I want to be a man like Abraham 
 He went to a foreign land 'cause You said go, he trusted You by faith 
 Of a tiny mustard see to mountains we can speak 
 Believe and move them by faith 
 It's the evidence of things I cannot see 
 And faith, it's the confidence that You are holding me 
 It's stepping out, it's breaking through all my doubts 
 And all I thought I knew 'cause you never live until you've lived by faith 
 No, you've never lived until you've lived by faith 
 You are who You say You are 
 And You will do what You have promised to and I believe, that's faith 
 'Cause it's the evidence of things I cannot see 
 Yeah, faith, it's the confidence that You are holding me 
 It's stepping out, it's breaking through all my doubts 
 And all I thought I knew 'cause you never live until you've lived by faith 
 No, you've never lived until you've lived by faith 
 You've never lived until you've lived by faith 
 You've never lived until you've lived 
 You've never lived until you've lived by faith 
 You've never lived until you've trusted grace 
 You've never lived until you lay it all down 
 So come and live, faith is living 
 You've never lived until you've lived by faith 
 You've never lived until you've trusted grace 
 You've never lived until you lay it all down 
 So come and live, faith is living 
 You've never lived until you've lived by faith 
 You've never lived until you've trusted grace 
 You've never lived until you lay it all down 
 So come and live, faith is living

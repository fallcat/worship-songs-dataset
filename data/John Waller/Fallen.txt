Intimate lover, I'm taken with You 
 Lost in Your beauty, Lord 
 Intimate lover, my comfort, my shelter 
 My refuge, my shepherd You are 
 Your love is deep and wide like a canyon 
 Too long have I stood on the edge 
 But now I've fallen, I've fallen 
 In Your beautiful, intimate love 
 I have fallen, I've fallen 
 Forever in intimate love with You 
 My intimate lover, I'm consumed by You 
 Over my head in Your love 
 Intimate lover, I'm learning to trust You 
 I've tasted and seen You are good 
 Your love is deep and vast as the ocean 
 Too long have I stood on the shore 
 But now I've fallen, I've fallen 
 In Your beautiful, intimate love 
 I have fallen, I've fallen 
 Forever in intimate love 
 How deep and wide, how long and high 
 Your beautiful, intimate love 
 How deep and wide, how long and high 
 Your beautiful, intimate love 
 I've fallen, I've fallen 
 In Your beautiful, intimate love 
 Jesus, intimate lover 
 Jesus, intimate lover

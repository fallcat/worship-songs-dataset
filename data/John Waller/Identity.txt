You are love 
 So I am love 
 You are joy 
 And so I am, joy 
 You are peace 
 So I am peace 
 Lord everything you are 
 Now becomes me 
 The line between 
 Where you begin 
 And where I end 
 Is gone, now I'm in 
 YOU, I know who I am 
 You're my true, born identity 
 I'm not the one I used to be 
 For now there is no separating 
 You from who I am 
 You are strong 
 So I am strong 
 You are power 
 And so I am powerful 
 You are mercy 
 So I am mercy 
 Cause everything you are 
 Has now become me 
 Anything less is not us 
 Anything less is not us 
 Anything else is not who we are

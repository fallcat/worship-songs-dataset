It's so beautiful way up here 
 Where the air's so crisp and I just wish I could stay 
 On this mountain where all is well 
 But I've looked around 
 And nobody else seems to live here 
 This is not the place 
 Where I learned Your ways are higher 
 Where You mold me like clay 
 And You're with me through the fire 
 And most of my story is down in the valley 
 Where You refine my heart, yeah 
 I've seen Your glory just like a burning flame 
 Up on the mountain high but I was made 
 Where most of my story is down in the valley 
 It's just natural living down here 
 Where there's barely time for the daily grind 
 But I believe through the valley You walk with me 
 Now I look around, I'm exactly where You want me to be 
 This is the place 
 Where I learned Your ways are higher 
 Where You mold me like clay 
 And You're with me through the fire 
 Where most of my story is down in the valley 
 Where You refine my heart, yeah 
 I've seen Your glory just like a burning flame 
 Up on the mountain high but I was made 
 Where most of my story is down in the valley 
 Where You refine my heart 
 It's in the day to day 
 When it seems mundane 
 You've been the greatest work in me 
 The greatest work in me 
 Where my story is down in the valley 
 Where You refine my heart, yeah 
 I've seen Your glory just like a burning flame 
 (Up on the mountain high) 
 I love the mountain 
 But I'm a man of the valley 
 Oh, I love the mountain 
 But I'm a man of the valley 
 Oh, oh, oh, yeah

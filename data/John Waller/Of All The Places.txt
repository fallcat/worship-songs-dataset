Carefully they wrapped Him and they laid Him on the hay 
 Infinite Creator, the Truth, the Life, the Way 
 And it seems like such a shame 
 To find the name above all names in such a cold unholy place 
 Of all the places for the Lord of Lords 
 Of all the places for a King 
 Of all the places for deity to be 
 Who would imagine that He would come to this place for me? 
 Cruelly they mocked Him and they nailed Him to a beam 
 Father, forgive them was the whisper of Calvary 
 How could they just stand 
 And watch the Great I Am dying for man? 
 Of all the places for the Lord of Lords 
 Of all the places for a King 
 Of all the places for deity to be 
 Who would imagine that He would come to this place for me? 
 In the rubble of my life He found what was left of me 
 He entered in and bound up the wounds that tortured me 
 And I was so amazed to see Him face to face 
 Oh, amazing is His grace, yeah 
 Of all the places for the Lord of Lords 
 Of all the places for a King 
 Of all the places for deity to be 
 Who would imagine that He would come to this place for me? 
 Yeah, of all of the places 
 From the manger to the cross 
 To the hearts of the lost 
 Of all of the places 
 Carefully they wrapped Him and they laid Him on the hay

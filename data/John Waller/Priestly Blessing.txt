When the morning comes and the day begins 
 I will go out in perfect peace 
 And as the sun goes down and darkness comes around 
 Unafraid I'll go to sleep 
 Over the fathers and the mothers 
 And the daughters and the sons we pray 
 Lord bless us and keep us 
 Make Your face to shine upon us 
 Raise Your countenance on us 
 And give us peace, oh God 
 Just bless us and keep us 
 Make Your face to shine upon us 
 Raise You countenance on us 
 And give us peace, oh give us peace 
 Over all our days and through all our paths 
 May we not forget this truth 
 Those who just believe, You keep in perfect peace 
 Those of age and those of youth 
 Over the fathers and the mothers 
 And the daughters and the sons we pray 
 Lord bless us and keep us 
 Make Your face to shine upon us 
 Raise You countenance on us 
 And give us peace, oh God 
 Just bless us and keep us 
 Make Your face to shine upon us 
 Raise Your countenance on us 
 And give us peace 
 Bless us and keep us 
 Make Your face to shine upon us 
 Raise Your countenance on us 
 And give us peace, please God 
 Bless us and keep us 
 Make Your face to shine upon us 
 Raise Your countenance on us 
 And give us peace, give us peace 
 Yeah, oh Lord give us peace, give us peace

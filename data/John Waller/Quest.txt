It's like a blind man in a dark room 
 Looking for a black cat that isn't there 
 It's like a man overboard in the high seas 
 Swimming for his life to find land anywhere 
 And everybody knows emptiness 
 Everywhere they're all on a quest 
 But nobody seems to know 
 The reason for their restlessness 
 Everybody's lost in aimlessness 
 But somebody brought hope to hopelessness 
 Now everybody needs to know 
 That they can know the master of the quest 
 It's like Don Quixote on his journey 
 His trusty sidekick by his side El Dorado bound 
 It's all around, it could it be you 
 People searching, are you searching for what I've found? 
 'Cause everybody knows emptiness 
 Everywhere they're all on a quest 
 But nobody seems to know 
 The reason for their restlessness 
 Everybody's lost in aimlessness 
 But somebody brought hope to hopelessness 
 Now everybody needs to know 
 That they can know the master of 
 Don't you know He's at your door? 
 He is the one you're looking for 
 He is the one you're looking for 
 Everybody's lost in aimlessness 
 But somebody brought hope to hopelessness 
 Now everybody needs to know 
 That Jesus came to bring them rest 
 Knows emptiness 
 Everywhere they're all on a quest 
 But nobody seems to know 
 The reason for their restlessness 
 Everybody's lost in aimlessness 
 But somebody brought hope to hopelessness 
 Now everybody needs to know 
 That Jesus came to bring them rest 
 Bring them rest from the quest 
 He's the one you're looking for 
 He's the one you're looking for

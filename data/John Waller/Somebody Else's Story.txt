I wanna be a part, I wanna be a part 
 Of somebody finding love 
 Somebody finding love unfailing 
 I wanna be a part, I wanna be a part 
 Of somebody finding life 
 Somebody finding life everlasting 
 And I wanna play a part, I wanna play a part 
 Of somebody finding hope 
 Somebody finding hope in God of Heaven 
 It's my desire 
 Lord, you would use me 
 To change somebody else's destiny 
 I wanna be a part, I wanna be a part 
 Of somebody else's story 
 Somebody else's story of redemption 
 I wanna be the one, I wanna be the one 
 To shine the light of Jesus into their darkness 
 So lead me to that someone, I pray 
 Lord, I wanna bring You glory 
 In somebody else's story 
 Somebody else's story 
 I wanna be a part, I wanna be a part 
 Of somebody finding comfort 
 Somebody finding comfort when they're hurting 
 And I wanna play a part, I wanna play a part 
 Of caring for the widow 
 And sheltering the orphan 
 It's my desire 
 Lord, You would use me 
 To change somebody else's destiny 
 I wanna be a part, I wanna be a part 
 Of somebody else's story 
 Somebody else's story of redemption 
 I wanna be the one, I wanna be the one 
 To shine the light of Jesus into their darkness 
 So lead me to that someone, I pray 
 Lord, I wanna bring You glory 
 In somebody else's story 
 I wanna be a part, I wanna be a part 
 Of somebody else's story 
 Somebody else's story of redemption 
 This hope in me was not meant to be 
 Contained inside, I've got to give it away, give it away 
 This hope in me was not meant to be 
 Contained inside, I've got to give it away, give it away 
 I wanna be a part, I wanna be a part 
 Of somebody else's story 
 Somebody else's story of redemption

I drug his name through godless places 
 And I've known shame that no child of his should know 
 I've seen pain on broken faces 
 Beyond all thought of hope 
 I was just too far from home 
 Still I always wondered when I closed my eyes 
 After all I've done 
 Could he run to me? 
 Would he kiss my face? 
 Could he even look at me? 
 After where I've been 
 Should he take me back? 
 I would understand 
 I've disgraced him 
 But it would be amazing 
 If he still calls me son 
 With nothing left for me to bring him 
 I left my pride and turned my heart toward home 
 I saw my home on the horizon 
 And from a distance 
 I saw my Father 
 Watching for his own with forgiving eyes 
 After all I'd done 
 He just ran to me 
 Then he kissed my face 
 He would not let go of me 
 After where I'd been 
 He just welcomed me 
 I didn't understand 
 But he put his robe on me 
 It was so amazing 
 That he still called me son 
 One day as I breathe my last 
 And I know my days on earth have ended 
 When every hour is spent 
 I will close my eyes in amazement 
 And I'll hear angels 
 They'll be singing 
 Amazing Grace 
 'Cause he will run to me 
 And he will kiss my face 
 He will not let go of me 
 After where I've been 
 He will welcome me 
 I won't understand 
 How he'll put his robe on me 
 It will be amazing 
 That he'll still call me son 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
 When he calls me son 
 I once was lost but now I'm found 
 'Cause he calls me Son

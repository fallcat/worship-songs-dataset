Let it be said of us 
 While we walked among the living 
 Let it be said of us 
 By the ones we leave behind 
 Let it be said of us 
 That we lived to be a blessing for life 
 Let it be said of us 
 That we gave to reach the dying 
 Let it be said of us 
 By the fruit we leave behind 
 Let it be said of us that our legacy is blessing for life 
 This day 
 You set life, you set death right before us, this day 
 Every blessing and curse is a choice now 
 And we will 
 Choose to be a blessing for life 
 Let it be said of us 
 That our hearts belonged to Jesus 
 Let it be said of us 
 That we spoke the words of life 
 Let it be said of us 
 That our heritage is blessing for life 
 For your Kingdom 
 For our Children 
 For the sake of every nation

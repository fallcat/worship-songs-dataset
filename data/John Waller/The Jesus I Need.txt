She was desperate 
 Down to her last hope 
 Now she crawls on her hands and her knees 
 Through a crowd on a dusty road 
 If she could touch Him 
 She knew He could make her well 
 Reaching and straining 
 She touched His garment, healing fell 
 And this is the Jesus I want 
 Friend of the broken and weak 
 What He did for her 
 I know He'll do for me 
 This is the Jesus I want 
 Giver of life and peace 
 Still today He's reaching out to you and me 
 This is the Jesus I need 
 Tormented 
 He lost his mind 
 There was nothing but evil and anguish 
 There in those cold, dark eyes 
 But the day would come 
 Everyone would know 
 That the words of this Jesus 
 Could set free the captive and make them whole 
 And this is the Jesus I want 
 Friend of the broken and weak 
 What He did for him 
 I know He'll do for me 
 This is the Jesus I want 
 Giver of life and peace 
 Still today He's reaching out to you and me 
 This is the Jesus I need 
 More than a story book fable 
 He is alive and He's able 
 To rescue anyone who believes 
 And this is the Jesus I want 
 Friend of the broken and weak 
 And what He did for them 
 I know He'll do for you and me 
 This is the Jesus I want 
 Giver of life and peace 
 And still today He's reaching out to you and me 
 This is the Jesus I need, this is the Jesus I need 
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him 
 How I proved Him more and more 
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him 
 How I proved Him more and more

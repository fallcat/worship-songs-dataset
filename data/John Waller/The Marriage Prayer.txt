Father, I said till death do us part 
 I want to mean it with all of my heart 
 Help me to love You more than I love her 
 Then I know I can love her more than anyone else 
 And bring her in Your presence today 
 Make her what You want her to be 
 I pray to hear her heart 
 I pray she'll love You more 
 I pray to cherish and serve her 
 And we'll bring You glory today, I pray 
 I pray

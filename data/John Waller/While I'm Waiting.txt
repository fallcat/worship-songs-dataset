I'm waiting 
 I'm waiting on You, Lord 
 And I am hopeful 
 I'm waiting on You, Lord 
 Though it is painful 
 But patiently, I will wait 
 I will move ahead, bold and confident 
 Taking every step in obedience 
 While I'm waiting 
 I will serve You 
 While I'm waiting 
 I will worship 
 While I'm waiting 
 I will not faint 
 I'll be running the race 
 Even while I wait 
 I'm waiting 
 I'm waiting on You, Lord 
 And I am peaceful 
 I'm waiting on You, Lord 
 Though it's not easy 
 But faithfully, I will wait 
 Yes, I will wait 
 I will serve You while I'm waiting 
 I will worship while I'm waiting 
 I will serve You while I'm waiting 
 I will worship while I'm waiting 
 I will serve you while I'm waiting 
 I will worship while I'm waiting on You, Lord

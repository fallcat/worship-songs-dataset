The world is searching for a simple answer 
 It's reaching out for hope amid disaster 
 There is a name of love that we can call on 
 And whisper through the roar 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus 
 There is only one who fills the empty 
 Offers all He has to heal the broken 
 When we're on our knees about to crumble 
 We whisper through the roar 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus 
 Jesus, the only name that saves 
 Jesus, the only name that saves 
 Jesus, the only name that saves 
 Jesus, the only name that saves 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus 
 The beautiful name, that beautiful name 
 The beautiful name Jesus

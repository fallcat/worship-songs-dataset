It seems like 
 My feet are always in motion 
 Taking me to anywhere 
 But where You want me 
 I try to keep things constantly moving 
 Hoping for a faster way 
 Than what You're doing 
 But Your love is chasing after me 
 It's chasing after me 
 There's nowhere I could ever hide 
 'Cause You keep coming 
 Your love is chasing after me 
 It's chasing after me 
 And I don't know what 
 I've been running from 
 You seem to always know 
 What I'm thinking 
 No wonder why I feel so tired 
 From my escaping 
 I see it's all a matter of choosing 
 But I learned without Your love 
 I'll end up losing 
 'Cause Your love is chasing after me 
 It's chasing after me 
 There's nowhere I could ever hide 
 'Cause You keep coming 
 Your love is chasing after me 
 It's chasing after me 
 And I don't know what 
 I've been running from 
 'Cause You, You never let me go 
 You're there when I turn around 
 Pointless to try and run away 
 I know there's nothing I could do 
 I know there's nothing left to prove 
 This life will never ever feel 
 Your love is chasing after me 
 It's chasing after me 
 There's nowhere I could ever hide 
 'Cause You keep coming 
 Your love is chasing after me 
 It's chasing after me 
 And I don't know why 
 I've been running 
 Your love is chasing after me 
 Chasing after me 
 There's nowhere I could ever hide 
 'Cause You keep coming 
 Your love is chasing after me 
 Chasing after me 
 And I don't know why 
 I've been running from 
 I've been running from 
 Chasing after me 
 I've been running from

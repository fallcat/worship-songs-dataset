Glorious king of love 
 Lord, You are faithful Savior 
 Marvelous are Your ways 
 Lord, You rule over us 
 We ask and we pray and we wait 
 For the day you left this fire burn 
 So we ask and we pray and we turn from our ways 
 And hope of Your return 
 'Cause you are the father of all these children 
 And You are the God that saves 
 You are the Lord off all who are broken 
 So hear my pray, come and save us, come and save us 
 Infinite god of grace 
 Lord, You are wounded healer 
 Merciful holy one 
 Deliver us from ourselves 
 We ask and we pray and we wait 
 For the day you left this fire burn 
 So we ask and we pray and we turn from our ways 
 And hope of Your return 
 'Cause you are the father of all these children 
 And You are the God that saves 
 You are the Lord off all who are broken 
 So hear my pray, come and save us, come and save us 
 You are the God, You are the God 
 You are the God, the God who saves 
 You are the God, You are the God 
 You are the God, the God who saves 
 You are the God, You are the God 
 You are the God, the God who saves 
 You are the God, You are the God 
 You are the God, the God who saves 
 You are the God of all of these children 
 You are the Lord of all who are broken 
 You are the God of all of these children 
 You are the God who saves 
 You are the Lord of all who are broken 
 So Lord, we pray 
 You are the God of all of these children 
 You are the God who saves 
 You are the Lord of all who are broken 
 So Lord, we pray, come and save us 
 Come and save us

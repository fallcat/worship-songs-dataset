This is not the time 
 For me to try to hide 
 Lord, I need to see You 
 I'm reaching out my hand 
 Remind me where I stand 
 Lord I need Your touch to... 
 Fall over me 
 I need Your grace to fall over me 
 Lord I'm on my knees 
 I need Your love to fall over me 
 When I try to find 
 The reason and the rhyme 
 To all these questions 
 Emptiness abounds 
 Nothing has been found 
 That's when You start to... 
 Fall over me 
 I need Your grace to 
 Fall over me 
 Lord I'm on my knees 
 I need Your love to 
 Fall over me 
 How quickly I forget I've fallen 
 But every time I fail that's when You 
 Fall over me 
 Fall over me 
 Fall over me 
 I need Your grace to fall over me 
 Lord I'm on my knees 
 I need Your love to fall over me

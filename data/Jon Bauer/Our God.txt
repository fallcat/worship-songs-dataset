You tell the story of a life 
 You calm the storm of all of our fear inside 
 You're the center of our hearts 
 And we admit we need You now 
 'Cause like the wind we're nothing without Your power 
 We're nothing without Your power 
 I've got come surrender 
 I've got Your ray of wonder 
 And all things seen the glory of our God 
 I've got our Lord our master 
 I've got what we're all after 
 We think to forever praise our God 
 So You have come to lead the way 
 And we will think to follow the God of grace 
 You're the author of our faith 
 So we will join our half today 
 And you have said the sentiment of the love we raise 
 Crying for You now 
 I've got come surrender 
 I've got Your ray of wonder 
 And all things seen the glory of our God 
 I've got our Lord our master 
 I've got what we're all after 
 We think to forever praise our God 
 Oh, there's no one like our God 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like our God 
 I've got come surrender 
 I've got Your ray of wonder 
 And all things seen the glory of our God 
 I've got our Lord our master 
 I've got what we're all after 
 We think to forever praise our God

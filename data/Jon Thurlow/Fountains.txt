Case all your cares on Me 
 'Cause I care for you 
 I care for you 
 All your fountains are in Me, and I have everything you need 
 Just keep coming back to Me 
 Those who call upon My name, they will not be put to shame 
 Just keep coming back to Me 
 Come to Me if you're weary and I'll give you rest 
 I'll give you rest 
 My yoke is so easy and My burden is less 
 My burden is less

Your name is like ointment poured forth 
 Your name is your character, your nature 
 It's the way that you live, it's your behavior 
 Anything and everything you are is all wrapped up in that name 
 And every name has a fragrance, a perfume 
 It's the thing that hits you when they walk into the room 
 And Jesus if that person is You I will say 
 I love the fragrance of Your name, O Lord 
 I love the fragrance of Your name 
 Jesus, the fragrance of Your name is humility 
 The heart of a servant, long suffering 
 Coming down from heaven to earth, You made Your home among man 
 And being found in appearance as a Man 
 You humbled Yourself, became obedient to the point of death 
 And I can say with confidence, that there's no greater love than this 
 How I love, how I love 
 The fragrance of Your name

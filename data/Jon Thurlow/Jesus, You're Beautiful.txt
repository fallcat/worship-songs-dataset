Spirit of wisdom, open my eyes again 
 Spirit of revelation, open my heart again 
 'Cause I want to see 
 Lord I want to see, see you rightly, Jesus 
 I know that Your eyes are like flames of fire 
 I know that Your head is white as wool 
 I know that Your voice it sounds like waters 
 Jesus, You're beautiful 
 There is none like You, Lord 
 Jesus, You're beautiful 
 There is no one like You in the heavens or on the earth

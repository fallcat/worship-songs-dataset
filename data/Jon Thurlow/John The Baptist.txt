Years of living in the desert crying out, 
 "Make way for One who's greater than me." 
 Now I'm here in prison, death is in my vision 
 Is it true that You're really He? And You say, 
 "Blind men see and cripples stand to their feet 
 Deaf men hear 
 The dead are raised, the poor receive good news 
 And blessed are those who are not offended at Me" 
 Many years of leading people to repentance 
 Soon the Kingdom really will come 
 Now my time is ending should I be expecting someone else 
 Or are you the One? You say, 
 "Blind men see and cripples stand to their feet 
 Deaf men hear 
 The dead are raised, the poor receive good news 
 And blessed are those who are not offended at Me"

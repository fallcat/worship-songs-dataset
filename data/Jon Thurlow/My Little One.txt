There's no need to be afraid 
 Daddy's here and it's okay 
 My love will take the fear away 
 My little one 
 You can give to Me the doubts and fears 
 Pour out your heart, I'll catch the tears 
 I've always been the God who hears 
 My little one 
 You've held it in a long, long time 
 So let it out, it's okay to cry 
 My heart and arms are open wide 
 My little one 
 I'll hold you close and tight to Me 
 I'll help you through the unbelief 
 I said that I would never leave 
 My little one 
 The Man who's full of grace and truth 
 One day He will come for you 
 He's gonna make it all brand new 
 My little one 
 On the mountain close to Jacob's stair 
 A place for you I have prepared 
 My light and truth will take you there 
 My little one

You while being reviled did not revile in return 
 While suffering You uttered no threats 
 You kept entrusting Yourself to the rightous Judge on the throne 
 You bore my sin in Your body on the cross 
 That I might die to sin 
 And live to righteousness for by Your wounds I'm healed 
 I was continually straying 
 But now I've returned to the Guardian of my soul 
 My merciful, faithful High Priest 
 He lives, He lives to make intercession for me

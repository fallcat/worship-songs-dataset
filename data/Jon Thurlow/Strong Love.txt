Your love is written on my heart 
 There is not a flood that could quench this love 
 Your love is stronger than the grave 
 Death could never take me from this love 
 I know the end of the story 
 I'll come up from the wilderness 
 Leaning on my Beloved 
 Your love is so high 
 Your love is so wide 
 Your love is so deep 
 Your love is so long 
 Death nor life nor angels nor powers 
 Present things nor things in the future 
 Height nor depth nor any created thing 
 Can separate me from this strong love 
 It's Your strong love, Your strong love

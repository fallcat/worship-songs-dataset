I remember Your faithfulness to Noah, 
 I remember Your faithfulness to Moses, 
 I remember Your faithfulness to David, 
 I remember Your faithfulness to me 
 I remember that rainbow 
 How Your presence when with him 
 Your sure and steadfast mercies 
 You have never left me, Lord 
 No one, there is none like You, Jesus

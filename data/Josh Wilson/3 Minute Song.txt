I tried to write a song and keep it 3 minutes long 
 Get in, get out, nobody gets hurt 
 And I tried a thousand times to fit God between the lines 
 But I'm finding out that doesn't really work 
 I just don't have the words to say 'cause words only get in my way 
 I must apologize, I have the hardest time 
 Finding something to define a God that I can't define 
 And even if I could, it would take way too long 
 If all I've got's a 3 minute song 
 I've got a hundred metaphors and if I had a million more 
 I could never ever seem to sum this up 
 Besides how can some melody communicate eternity 
 It's like trying to fit the ocean in a cup 
 I never find the words to say 'cause words only get in my way 
 I must apologize, I have the hardest time 
 Finding something to define a God that I can't define 
 And even if I could, it would take way too long 
 If all I've got's a 3 minute song 
 I would like to dumb this down to 3 chords or maybe 4 
 But I've tried and I can't and I won't 'cause there will always be more 
 So I apologize, I can't seem to get it right 
 I must apologize, I have the hardest time 
 Finding something to define a God I just can't define 
 And even if I could, it would take way too long 
 If all I've got's a 3 minute song 
 Well, all I've got's a 3 minute song, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

One year after the rings and a west coast honeymoon 
 We are living in a rented house with a terrible view 
 You're finishing school and I'm writing songs 
 We've got no money but our love is strong 
 I'm gonna love you always 
 Even on the not so sunny days 
 Through the good and the bad 
 Baby, I still do 
 'Cause it's always only you 
 One day maybe you'll be a mom and I'll be a dad 
 But right now, baby just kiss me and let's not think about that 
 'Cause we're too busy planning cheap dates 
 We're rentin' old movies and staying up late 
 I'm gonna love you always 
 Even on the not so sunny days 
 Through the good and the bad 
 Baby, I still do 
 'Cause it's always only you 
 Do you remember the first time you held my hand 
 I'm sure I would have liked that concert, but I wasn't watching the band 
 I'm gonna love you always 
 Even on the not so sunny days 
 Through the good and the bad 
 Baby, I still do 
 I do love you, and I mean always 
 And I know they won't all be sunny days 
 But I meant what I said when I said I do 
 'Cause it's always only, just you and me 
 Always only you

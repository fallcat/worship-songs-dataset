The fading sun and rising moon 
 Are fighting for the afternoon 
 The day gives in, gives up its light 
 The stars wake up to keep the night 
 And as You glory fill the sky I wonder 
 How could You consider me 
 So much more than all I see 
 'Cause I am not, have never been beautiful like this, like this 
 My weary words and broken lies 
 Are set beneath Your summer skies 
 What's worn and wrong, what's good and right 
 I laid before my eyes tonight 
 And as You glory fill the sky I wonder 
 How could You consider me 
 So much more than all I see 
 'Cause I am not, have never been beautiful like this, like this 
 But you make all things new 
 Jesus, You make all things new 
 I'm beautiful in You, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no 
 That's how You could consider me 
 So much more than all I see 
 Redemption mends a brokenness 
 It heals our wounds, removes our sins 
 Your purest love was humbly spent 
 To bind my heart and draw me in 
 Where I become whole again 
 I'm beautiful like this, oh like this 
 What can wash away my sin 
 Nothing but Your blood, oh Jesus 
 Thank you, thank you Jesus

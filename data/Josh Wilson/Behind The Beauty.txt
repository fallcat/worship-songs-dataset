Does a sunrise somehow give you hope 
 Does a newborn baby 
 Stir something in your soul 
 And can a melody 
 Of a symphony inspire you 
 Inspire you 
 Look around, look around 
 Tell me can you see 
 All the wonder in the world 
 Is reason to believe 
 That there is something more 
 A love we can't ignore 
 Behind the beauty 
 Oh, can you remember your first kiss 
 Were you nervous and clumsy 
 But was it perfect and innocent 
 Sometimes the smallest things can cause 
 Our hears to sing the loudest 
 Tell me can you see 
 All the wonder in the world 
 Is reason to believe 
 That there is something more 
 A love we can't ignore 
 Behind the beauty 
 Just look around 
 There's a God who made us 
 There's a God who loves us 
 And He's speaking to us, to us 
 It's beautiful 
 Look around, look around 
 Tell me can you see 
 All the wonder in the world 
 Is reason to believe 
 That there is something more 
 A love we can't ignore 
 Yeah, there is so much more 
 A God we can't ignore 
 Behind the beauty

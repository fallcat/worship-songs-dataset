Yeah 
 She's dancing like a crazy fool 
 From the kitchen to the dining room 
 And she tells me, 'Baby, life is way too short to be too cool' 
 She says, 'When did we get so serious? 
 Can we just all stop acting unimpressed?' 
 There's a hundred million miracles in front of us passing by 
 God open my eyes 
 I wanna be blown away 
 By your extraordinary grace every ordinary day 
 Blown away 
 By your great big love in every little place 
 I wanna slow down look around 
 God please show me how to stop and be amazed 
 I wanna be blown away 
 Blown away 
 I want to see a sunset 
 And have to stop and catch my breath 
 O I never want to forget 
 How you take a dead heart and bring back to life again 
 Oh 
 When did we get so serious? 
 Can we just all stop acting unimpressed? 
 There's a hundred million miracles in front of us passing by 
 God open my eyes 
 I wanna be blown away 
 By your extraordinary grace every ordinary day 
 Blown away 
 By your great big love in every little place 
 I wanna slow down look around 
 God please show me how to stop and be amazed 
 I wanna be blown away 
 Blown away 
 The Earth is full of heaven 
 'Cause you're always breaking through 
 Put the wonder back inside these eyes 
 God, I don't want to miss you 
 When did we get so serious 
 Can we just all stop acting unimpressed 
 I wanna be blown away 
 By your extraordinary grace every ordinary day 
 Blown away 
 By your great big love in every little place 
 I wanna slow down look around God please show me how to stop and be amazed 
 I wanna be blown away 
 Blown away 
 I wanna be blown away 
 Blown away 
 Yeah 
 I wanna be 
 I wanna be blown away

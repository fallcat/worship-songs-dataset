I try to catch my breath 
 It hasn't happened yet 
 I'm wide awake in the middle of the night scared to death 
 So I prayed God, would You make this stop 
 Father please hold on to me, You're all I've got 
 Carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 From my sinking sand to Your solid ground 
 The only way I'm ever gonna make it out 
 Is if You carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 God carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 Jesus calm my heart 
 Come near me please 
 Lord don't let these worries get the best of me 
 Oh I believe, that You're still here with me 
 Cause You meant what You said when You said You'd never leave 
 Carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 From my sinking sand to Your solid ground 
 The only way I'm ever gonna make it out 
 Is if You carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 God carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 Carry me 
 God carry me 
 Carry me 
 God carry me 
 I'm at the end of myself 
 I know I've got nothing left 
 Feels like I'm stuck in the valley of the shadow of death 
 And I've been down here so long 
 I just can't find my way out 
 Oh God I don't stand a chance 
 Unless You carry me now 
 God carry me now 
 Carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 From my sinking sand to Your solid ground 
 The only way I'm ever gonna make it out 
 Is if You carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 God carry me, carry me, carry me now 
 Carry me now 
 Carry me now 
 Carry me now 
 Carry me now

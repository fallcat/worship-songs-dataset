I'm not sure what's left to say 
 I can't count the times I've turned away 
 To look for love in the saddest place 
 Don't give up on me, don't give up on me 
 Oh God I've been running for so long 
 Don't know how I get so far out here on my own 
 But oh God I'm running back to Your strong arms 
 I need to be where You are 
 I'm falling apart alone 
 I'm coming home 
 I'm scared to look You in the eyes 
 I've had a second chance a thousand times 
 But You're the light left on, You're an open door 
 And You'll always give a thousand more 
 Oh God I've been running for so long 
 Don't know how I get so far out here on my own 
 But oh God I'm running back to Your strong arms 
 I need to be where You are 
 I'm falling apart alone 
 I'm coming home 
 I'm a wandering soul 
 Who's found the truth 
 A restless heart 
 Can only rest in You 
 Oh God I've been running for so long 
 Don't know how I got so far out here on my own 
 Oh God I've been running for so long 
 Don't know how I get so far out here on my own 
 Oh God I'm running back to Your strong arms 
 I need to be where You are 
 I'm falling apart alone 
 I'm coming home 
 I'm coming home 
 I'm coming home

Dear money, I wrote a song for you 
 Cause you lead me to believe you buy me everything I need then you, fill me full of emptiness. 
 So money, it's time to call you out 
 About the way you say you pay and then you turn and walk away turns out, you can't keep your promises 
 I'm changing the locks of my pockets now, 'cause if I don't let you in then you can't run out. 
 Well I love to hate to love you, but I can't get enough of you, I can't get enough, so I've had enough of you 
 Hey money I've had enough you 
 Everyday it's all the same the way you love to complicate, I knew that we never should've met 
 Yeah money I'm asking you to leave nothing personal but you were never worth it all, oh please don't make this harder than it is. 
 I'm changing the locks of my pockets now, 'cause if I don't let you in then you can't run out. 
 Well I love to hate to love you, but I can't get enough of you, I can't get enough, so I've had enough of you. 
 End: 
 Hey money just leave me alone!

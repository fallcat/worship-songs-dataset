If you want a heart of sympathy 
 Then pray to God to help you, please 
 See the world that Jesus sees, yeah 
 But be careful what you're asking for 
 'Cause if you're gonna open up that door 
 There's no going back to before 
 'Cause once you see a mother who can't feed 
 The baby that cries in her arms 
 Your heart will break and you'll lay awake 
 No, sleep won't come quick anymore 
 So do you want to know? 
 You pass him on the way to work 
 He holds a sign beside the curb 
 You look away and avoid the hurt 
 'Cause why should you be held responsible 
 Besides, he'll probably just spend it all 
 On cigarettes and alcohol 
 But once you see that the man on the street 
 Has a name and a family like you 
 Your heart will break and you'll lay awake 
 'Cause you'll understand God loves him too 
 So do you want to know? Oh, no 
 If you want a heart of sympathy 
 Then pray to God to help you see 
 But once you see a world that's in need 
 And a sorrow you just can't ignore 
 Your heart's gonna break and you'll lay awake 
 'Cause you'll know you could do so much more 
 Do you want to know? 
 Do you want to know? 
 To know

It's hard to believe You right now 
 Questions keep crowding You out 
 And I'm falling in love 
 With my doubts instead of You 
 If I could start over again 
 And choose how I want to begin 
 What would I put my faith in 
 Would it still be You? 
 Don't, let go, God I'm begging You 
 Don't let go, when I question You 
 We both know, I'm no good on my own 
 So don't, let, go 
 A night when I can't fall asleep 
 From wondering just what it all means 
 Answers are not what I need 
 What I need is You 
 Don't, let go, God I'm begging You 
 Don't, let, go, when I question You 
 We, both know, I'm no good on my own 
 So don't let go 
 Why can't this be easy, just plain black and white 
 Why can't I believe like I did as a child 
 'Cause I just don't feel You tonight 
 Don't let go, God I'm begging You 
 Don't let go, we both know 
 You don't let go 
 You don't let go 
 You never let me go 
 Oh no, no, no

I remember when Your light came in. 
 I was ten years old with the faith of a kid, 
 I felt like I could walk on water then, 
 Wish that I could feel that again. 
 But I have learned that feelings come and go, 
 And we all know emotions ebb and flow. 
 Some days I gotta trust what I already know 
 That You never let go, You never let go. 
 So when I don't feel You moving, 
 That doesn't mean that You have disappeared. 
 And when I don't feel You with me, oh God 
 That doesn't mean You're not here. 
 So I keep on believing, yeah 
 Cause faith is not a feeling, oh 
 Yeah I keep on believing, yeah 
 Cause faith is not a feeling, oh 
 There are days I hear You loud and clear, 
 Like nothing in the world could interfere. 
 And I can sense You deep, deep down in my bones, 
 And I know I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone. 
 But when I don't feel You moving, 
 That doesn't mean that You have disappeared. 
 And when I don't feel You with me, oh God 
 That doesn't mean You're not here. 
 So I keep on believing, yeah 
 Cause faith is not a feeling, oh 
 Yeah I keep on believing, yeah 
 Cause faith is not a feeling, oh 
 Don't matter what comes my way 
 Gonna keep, keep believing 
 Even on my darkest days 
 Gonna keep, keep believing 
 Don't matter what comes my way 
 Gonna keep, keep believing 
 Even on my darkest days 
 Yeah like when I don't feel You moving, 
 That doesn't mean that You have disappeared. 
 And when I don't feel You with me, oh God 
 That doesn't mean You're not here. 
 Oh when I don't feel You moving, 
 That doesn't mean that You have disappeared. 
 And when I don't feel You with me, oh God 
 That doesn't mean You're not here. 
 So I keep on believing, yeah 
 Cause faith is not a feeling, oh 
 Yeah I keep on believing, yeah 
 Faith is not a feeling, oh 
 It's not a feeling 
 Faith is not a feeling 
 Don't matter what comes my way 
 Gonna keep, keep believing 
 Don't matter what comes my way 
 Gonna keep, keep believing

Why in the world did I think I could 
 Only get to know You when my life was good? 
 When everything just falls in place 
 The easiest thing is to give You praise 
 Now it all seems upside down 
 'Cause my whole world is caving in 
 But I feel You now more than I did then 
 How can I come to the end of me 
 And somehow still have all I need? 
 God, I want to know You more 
 Maybe this is how it starts 
 I find You when I fall apart 
 Blessed are the ones who understand 
 We got nothing to bring but empty hands, yeah 
 Nothing to hide and nothing to prove, yeah 
 Our heartbreak brings us back to You, oh 
 And it all seems upside down 
 'Cause my whole world is caving in 
 But I feel You now more than I did then 
 How can I come to the end of me 
 And somehow still have all I need? 
 God, I want to know You more 
 Maybe this is how it starts 
 I find You when I fall apart, yeah 
 I don't know how long this will last 
 I'm praying for the pain to pass 
 But maybe this is the best thing 
 That has ever happened to me 
 My whole world is caving in 
 But I feel You now more than I did then 
 How can I come to the end of me 
 And somehow still have all I need? 
 God, I want to know You more 
 Maybe this is how it starts 
 I find You when 
 You will find me when 
 I fall apart 
 I fall apart

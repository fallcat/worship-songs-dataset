He's not bulletproof 
 Don't let him fool you 
 His life is a lie 
 He's dying inside 
 From the sticks and stones somebody threw 
 Our tongues are like matches 
 Our ears are like trees 
 Our words are like sparks 
 On dry summer leaves 
 It doesn't take much 
 For the flames to rise 
 And turn a soul 
 Into a forest fire 
 She's not half as strong 
 As she'd like to let on 
 She smiles but she knows 
 She can't take one more blow 
 From the hate that she's heard for so long 
 Our tongues are like matches 
 Our ears are like trees 
 Our words are like sparks 
 On dry summer leaves 
 It doesn't take much 
 For the flames to rise 
 And turn a soul 
 Into a forest fire 
 Into a forest fire 
 Be careful what you say 
 Be careful what you say 
 Be careful 
 Our tongues are like matches 
 Our ears are like trees 
 Our words are like sparks 
 On dry summer leaves 
 It doesn't take much 
 For the flames to rise 
 And turn a soul-- 
 Oh and turn us all-- 
 Into a forest fire 
 Into a forest fire 
 Be careful 
 Be careful what you say

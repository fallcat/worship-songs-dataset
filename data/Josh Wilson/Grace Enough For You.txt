Why are you still holding on 
 To everything that you've done wrong? 
 You're praying "Father, please forgive," 
 But deep inside you wonder if He will. 
 Oh, yes He will. 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Aw come on just let it go 
 (Woah, woah) 
 All the pain and shame you hold 
 And the Lover of your soul 
 Will make you new 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Come on let the light inside 
 Woah, woah 
 There is nothing left to hide 
 Everything you heard is true 
 There is grace enough for you, 
 For you. 
 God has given you a different name, 
 Oh, once a sinner now a saint. 
 So leave your old self in the past, 
 Well just run to Jesus and don't look back. 
 Yeah 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Aw come on just let it go 
 (Woah, woah) 
 All the pain and shame you hold 
 And the Lover of your soul 
 Will make you new 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Come on let the light inside 
 (Woah, woah) 
 There is nothing left to hide 
 Everything you heard is true 
 There is grace enough for you. 
 We are sons and daughters 
 Of a merciful Father above. 
 And nothing, well nothing could ever 
 Separate us from His love. 
 There's grace enough for me 
 There's grace enough for you 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Aw come on just let it go 
 (Woah, woah) 
 All the pain and shame you hold 
 And the Lover of your soul 
 Will make you new 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Come on let the light inside 
 (Woah, woah) 
 You got nothing left to hide 
 Everything you heard is true 
 There is grace enough for you 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Yeah, grace enough for you 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Oh grace enough, grace enough, grace enough for you and me 
 (Woah, woah) 
 Grace enough, grace enough, grace enough for you and me 
 Grace enough, grace enough, grace enough for you and me

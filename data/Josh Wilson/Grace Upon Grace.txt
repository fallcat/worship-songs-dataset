Every morning I open up my eyes to see mercy's brand new 
 Darkness disappears and the day reveals all You've carried me through 
 You are so faithful and I am so grateful God 
 Heavenly Father 
 You love like no other 
 You call me Your own 
 You never let go 
 You are my rescue 
 How can I thank You 
 My sin is erased, my heart is amazed by Your 
 Grace upon grace 
 Seems impossible, a love unstoppable that just won't give up on me 
 You left the 99 to find a heart like mine that's all the proof that I need 
 You are so faithful and I am so grateful God 
 Heavenly Father 
 You love like no other 
 You call me Your own 
 You never let go 
 You are my rescue 
 How can I thank You? 
 My sin is erased, my heart is amazed by Your 
 Grace upon grace 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I was made for You, I was made for You 
 I am Yours, I am Yours 
 I will live for You, I will live for You (Lord) 
 Heavenly Father 
 You love like no other 
 You call me Your own 
 You never let go 
 You are my rescue 
 How can I thank You? 
 My sin is erased, my heart is amazed 
 Forever oh God I will give You my praise 
 My sin is erased, my heart is amazed by Your 
 Grace upon grace

I'm like Moses in the desert 
 When that bush went up in flames. 
 You said, "Go and tell your story." 
 He said, "God, what will I say? 
 I'm so scared, unprepared 
 What difference will I make?" 
 Sometimes I feel the same. 
 If it's weakness that You want, 
 I've got more than enough. 
 But some days I am so afraid 
 To show this fragile love. 
 But I'll give You all of me 
 And my insecurities. 
 God I don't have what it takes, 
 But here I am anyway. 
 Here I am anyway. 
 God, I've got so many questions, 
 Wonder why You placed me here. 
 You have given me these passions, 
 But they come with so much fear. 
 Sometimes it don't make sense at all 
 But I guess if I was brave 
 Then I wouldn't walk by faith. 
 If it's weakness that You want, 
 I've got more than enough. 
 But some days I am so afraid 
 To show this fragile love. 
 But I'll give You all of me 
 And my insecurities. 
 God I don't have what it takes, 
 But here I am anyway. 
 Here I am anyway. 
 If You say go (If You say go, if You say go) 
 I won't say no (I won't say no, I won't say no) 
 If You say go (If You say go, if You say go) 
 I won't say no (I won't say no, I won't say no) 
 'Cause it's weakness that You want, 
 That's how You show Your love. 
 Your power is made perfect, 
 When we are not enough. 
 If it's weakness that You want, 
 I've got more than enough. 
 But some days I am so afraid 
 To show this fragile love. 
 But I'll give You all of me 
 And my insecurities. 
 God I don't have what it takes, 
 But here I am anyway. 
 Here I am anyway. 
 Here I am anyway, anyway. 
 Here I am anyway, anyway.

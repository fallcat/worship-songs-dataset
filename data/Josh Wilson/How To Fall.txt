It was prettier than poetry the first time you said hello to me 
 Well, call it crazy, call it meant to be, yeah 
 But it didn't take me long to see 
 That you mean more than anyone 
 I'm running in circles, jumping over hurdles, working on a song to sing 
 I wanna tell you how I'm feeling, finding it hard to do 
 'Cause I don't know how to say it, don't know how you'll take it 
 Don't know how to fall in love, but I wanna learn with you 
 I wanna learn 
 Well, my friends say I should take it slow 
 But my dad says when you know, you know 
 So maybe I'll just rent a car 
 Well and I'll drive right back to where you are 
 'Cause you mean more than anything 
 I'm running in circles, jumping over hurdles, working on a song to sing 
 I wanna tell you how I'm feeling, finding it hard to do 
 'Cause I don't know how to say it, don't know how you'll take it 
 Don't know how to fall in love, but I wanna learn with you 
 I wanna learn, I wanna learn with you 
 I never thought I'd drop my guard 
 Then you broke into my clumsy heart, yeah 
 I'm running in circles, jumping over hurdles, working on a song to sing 
 I wanna tell you how I'm feeling, finding it hard to do, so hard to do 
 'Cause I don't know how to say it, don't know how you'll take it 
 Don't know how to fall in love, but I wanna learn 
 I'm running in circles, jumping over hurdles, working on a song to sing 
 I wanna tell you how I'm feeling, finding it hard to do, so hard to do 
 'Cause I don't know how to say it, don't know how you'll take it 
 Don't know how to fall in love, but I wanna learn with you 
 Do you wanna learn? 'Cause I wanna learn, oh, with You 
 With You, with You

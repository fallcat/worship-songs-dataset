Sometimes I 
 I just want to close my eyes 
 And act like everyone's alright 
 When I know they're not 
 This world needs God 
 But it's easier to stand and watch 
 I could say a prayer and just move on 
 Like nothing's wrong 
 But I refuse 
 'Cause I don't want to live like I don't care 
 I don't want to say another empty prayer 
 Oh, I refuse 
 To sit around and wait for someone else 
 To do what God has called me to do myself 
 Oh, I could choose 
 Not to move but I refuse 
 I can hear the least of these 
 Crying out so desperately 
 And I know we are the hands and feet 
 Of You, oh God 
 So, if You say move 
 It's time for me to follow through 
 And do what I was made to do 
 Show them who You are 
 'Cause I don't want to live like I don't care 
 I don't want to say another empty prayer 
 Oh, I refuse 
 To sit around and wait for someone else 
 To do what God has called me to do myself 
 Oh, I could choose 
 Not to move but I refuse 
 To stand and watch the weary and lost 
 Cry out for help 
 I refuse to turn my back 
 And try and act like all is well 
 I refuse to stay unchanged 
 To wait another day, to die to myself 
 I refuse to make one more excuse 
 'Cause I don't want to live like I don't care 
 I don't want to say another empty prayer 
 Oh, I refuse 
 To sit around and wait for someone else 
 To do what God has called me to do myself 
 Oh, I could choose 
 Not to move but I refuse 
 I refuse 
 I refuse

Wish that I was there 
 On that silent night 
 When your tiny heart started beating for mine 
 I wish I could have seen 
 The star in David's town 
 When you turned a stable into a Holy ground 
 I sing along, the angel's song 
 Noel, Noel, Jesus is alive 
 Emanuel, hope is here tonight 
 So go, and tell, the world that death has died 
 'Cause Jesus is alive, yeah Jesus is alive 
 The God who made us all 
 With these two little hands 
 Is bringing us his kingdom 
 Quiet as a lamb 
 Oh such Amazing Grace 
 A divine conspiracy 
 This Savior in a manger changes everything 
 That's why we sing 
 Noel, Noel, Jesus is alive 
 Emanuel, hope is here tonight 
 So go, and tell, the world that death has died 
 'Cause Jesus is alive, yeah Jesus is alive 
 Sin you have no sting 
 Hell you have no power (Jesus is alive) 
 Curse you are no more 
 This is your final hour (Jesus is alive) 
 Because the son of God 
 Has not left us alone (Jesus is alive) 
 He'll live and die and rise again 
 And then he'll bring us home (Jesus is alive) 
 The old will pass away 
 And we will become new (Jesus is alive) 
 This baby boy is making all sad things untrue 
 Noel, Noel, Jesus is alive 
 Emanuel, hope is here tonight 
 So go, and tell, the world that death has died 
 Noel, Noel, Jesus is alive (Jesus is alive) 
 Emanuel, hope is here tonight (Jesus is alive) 
 So go, and tell, the world that death has died 
 'Cause Jesus is alive, yeah Jesus is alive 
 Yeah Jesus is alive 
 Jesus is alive

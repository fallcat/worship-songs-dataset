So it all went wrong 
 I started singing that sad sad song 
 So convinced that I was on my own 
 God I know 
 That you won't leave 
 Guess I let it slip my memory 
 Fast as I could count to 1-2-3-forgetful me 
 Whoa 
 Here I go again 
 Why do I forget you're always faithful 
 Whoa 
 How many times have I seen 
 You give me just what I need 
 Whoa 
 Here I go again 
 I forget you're gonna work it out somehow 
 You'd think that I'd know by now 
 Well I'd like to learn to live by faith 
 As the flowers of the field must say 
 Worry doesn't add a single day 
 Oh God I pray 
 You'll help me see 
 When I'm looking at my history 
 All the ways you've taken care of me 
 I wanna believe but 
 Whoa 
 Here I go again 
 Why do I forget you're always faithful 
 Whoa 
 How many times have I seen 
 You give me just what I need 
 Whoa 
 Here I go again 
 I forget you're gonna work it out somehow 
 You'd think that I'd know by now 
 That you are always in control 
 I should know by now 
 That you're gonna work it out 
 But this shadow of a doubt wont let me go-o-o-o 
 Here I go again 
 Why do I forget you're always faithful 
 Whoa 
 How many times have I seen 
 You give me just what I need 
 Whoa 
 Here I go again 
 I forget you're gonna work it out somehow 
 You're gonna work it out somehow 
 You'd think that I'd know by now

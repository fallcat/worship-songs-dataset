Try and pretend that you're okay 
 But I don't believe the smile you fake 
 It's about time that you stopped saving face 
 I'll meet you where you are 
 I'll meet you where you are 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you? 
 Oh, you don't have to prove a thing 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you 
 For you who you are, not who you should be? 
 Let me love you and I will let you love me too 
 Why are you scared to tell the truth? 
 What do you think you're gonna lose? 
 You know we're forgiven, not accused 
 I'll meet you where you are 
 I'll meet you where you are 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you? 
 Oh, you don't have to prove a thing 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you 
 For you who you are, not who you should be? 
 Let me love you and I will let you love me too 
 I will let you love me too 
 Try and pretend that you're okay 
 But we both know that you're not alright 
 And that's okay 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you? 
 Oh, you don't have to prove a thing 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you 
 For you who you are, not who you? 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you? 
 Oh, you don't have to prove a thing 
 Why don't you let me, let me love you 
 For you who you are, not who you should be? 
 Let me love you and I will let you love me

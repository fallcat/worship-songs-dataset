In the beginning 
 You brought this world to life 
 With only a whisper 
 Let there be light. 
 Now here in my heart, 
 Won't You come do the same, 
 Shine in my darkness, 
 And chase it away. 
 Let there be light 
 Inside my life 
 So the whole world sees 
 You in me 
 God let Your grace 
 Make my heart blaze 
 Like a burning sun 
 In the middle of the night 
 Let there be light 
 Even if it hurts, 
 I know it's worth the pain. 
 God won't You burn this 
 Old self away? 
 Oh, this is redemption, 
 And this is the change I need, 
 And it's been a long time coming. 
 Let there be light 
 Inside my life 
 So the whole world sees 
 You in me 
 God let Your grace 
 Make my heart blaze 
 Like a burning sun 
 In the middle of the night 
 Let there be light 
 Jesus, I don't wanna hide anymore, 
 So chase out the shadows 
 And kick down the doors. 
 I'm ready for this, I've finally decided 
 To let the light in. 
 Let there be light 
 Inside my life 
 So the whole world sees 
 You in me 
 God let Your grace 
 Make my heart blaze 
 Like a burning sun 
 In the middle of the night 
 Let there be light 
 Let there be light 
 Let there be light 
 Let there be light

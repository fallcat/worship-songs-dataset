Well, I live too loud and I talk too much 
 But somehow I don't see it as such 
 Seems like what I love the most 
 Is the sound of my own voice 
 I pray my list and I say my piece 
 I check you off but I'm incomplete 
 Seems like what I'm missing most 
 Is the sound of your voice 
 So why is it so hard for me 
 To shut my mouth and let you speak? 
 Why do I feel the need 
 To always keep on talking? 
 Well, I know I need to hear from you 
 I know what I have got to do 
 To find what I've been missing, yeah 
 I've gotta learn to listen 
 A wise man hears before he speaks 
 He knows he doesn't know everything 
 I wish that sounded more like me 
 But I have got so far to go 
 But why is my first reaction 
 To give my own opinion? 
 Like I could tell you something 
 You don't already know 
 So why is it so hard for me 
 To shut my mouth and let you speak? 
 Why do I feel the need 
 To always keep on talking? 
 Well, I know I need to hear from you 
 I know what I have got to do 
 To find what I've been missing, yeah 
 I've gotta learn to listen 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 So why is it so hard for me 
 To shut my mouth and let you speak? 
 Why do I feel the need 
 To always keep on talking? 
 Well, I know I need to hear from you 
 I know what I have got to do 
 I gotta find out what I'm missing 
 So why is it so hard for me 
 To shut my mouth and let you speak? 
 Why do I feel the need 
 To always keep on talking? 
 Oh, I know I need to hear from you 
 I know what I have got to do 
 I gotta find out what I'm missing, yeah 
 I've gotta learn to listen 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, listen, yeah 
 Listen, listen, yeah, listen, to listen

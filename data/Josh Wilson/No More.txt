Oh I know it all to well 
 Every inch inside this cell 
 I'm a prisoner of the choices I regret 
 The debts already paid 
 And the bails already made 
 So why do I keep coming back again? 
 God I'm done with holding on 
 To sins that you have saved me from 
 I'm ready to let go of who I've been 
 No more guilt, no more shame 
 No more thinking I can't change 
 Who I was is dead and gone 
 Who I am is moving on 
 Saved by grace held by love 
 Because of what your cross has done 
 You pulled away the prison doors 
 Hallelujah God 
 I am condemned no more 
 I am condemned no more 
 So I step out of the night into your burning light 
 Where my past and all its shadows disappear 
 You say that I am yours forever 
 You call me saint instead of sinner 
 No more guilt, no more shame 
 No more thinking I can't change 
 Who I was is dead and gone 
 Who I am is moving on 
 You pulled away the prison doors 
 Hallelujah God 
 I am condemned no more 
 I am condemned no more 
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness 
 Drive the dark doubt away 
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness 
 Fill me with the light of day 
 No more guilt, no more shame 
 No more thinking I can't change 
 Who I was is dead and gone 
 Who I am is moving on 
 You pulled away the prison doors 
 Hallelujah God 
 I am condemned no more 
 I am condemned no more 
 I am condemned no more 
 I am condemned no more

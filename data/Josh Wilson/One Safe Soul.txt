I can face unthinkable things 
 As long as you face them with me. 
 And I could take the world's worst news 
 As long as I get to come home to you. 
 And baby, you show me 
 The love of God. 
 And love is never blind, 
 You see all the wrongs 
 I try to hide. 
 But you stay right by my side 
 When all the world does not. 
 You're the one safe soul I've got. 
 Man's greatest fear is being alone, 
 And his second greatest is being known. 
 But if you are both known and loved, 
 You got nothing left to be scared of. 
 Oh baby, you show me 
 That love is never blind, 
 You see all the wrongs 
 I try to hide. 
 But you stay right by my side 
 When all the world does not. 
 You're the one safe soul I've got. 
 You are solace in the storm, 
 You are rest when I am worn, 
 You are words when I can't speak, 
 You are song when I can't sing. 
 Oh love is never blind, 
 You see all the wrongs 
 I try to hide. 
 But you stay right by my side 
 When all the world does not. 
 You're the one safe soul I've got.

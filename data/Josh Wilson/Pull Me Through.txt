Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong 
 Everything that should go right has gone wrong too 
 Everything steady has now been shaken 
 Now there is nothing for me to cling to 
 Now there is nothing left in me to lose 
 Now I am ready to see You waiting with open arms 
 So would You carry me 
 'Cause I am at the end of myself and all I have is You 
 So would You carry me 
 'Cause only You can pull me through 
 I know You're stronger than my struggle 
 I know You're greater than my greatest need 
 If You are ready and You are waiting with open arms 
 Then would You carry me 
 'Cause I am at the end of myself and all I have is You 
 So would You carry me 
 'Cause only You can pull me through, pull me through 
 Why do I wait so long 
 Through so many wrongs to face the truth? 
 I can't fix this shattered heart 
 I've tried so hard but only You can save me Savior 
 So would You carry me 
 'Cause I am at the end of myself and all I have is You 
 So would You carry me 
 'Cause all I need is You 
 So would You carry me 
 'Cause I am at the end of myself and all I have is You 
 So would You carry me 
 'Cause only You can pull me through, pull me through 
 Only You can pull me through, pull me through

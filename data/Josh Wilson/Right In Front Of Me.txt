Some say we've all been searching for a God 
 For years in vain 
 And some say belief is just the easy way 
 Around our pain 
 And sometimes I'd like to agree 
 When they're telling me that this is all an accident 
 Because it's hard to let this heart believe 
 When my mind is screaming out I need more evidence 
 But do I really need more evidence? 
 I want a miracle, something impossible 
 So would You help me to believe? 
 When You say everything that's right in front of me 
 Is all the proof I'll ever need 
 I hear it in the winter wind 
 That blows the icy snow against my skin 
 And I see it in that summer sun 
 That rises high and then burns out again 
 And I feel it in my chest 
 In the quiet moments that I trust in what You say 
 Would You help me trust in what You say? 
 I want a miracle, something impossible 
 So would You help me to believe? 
 When You say everything that's right in front of me 
 Is all the proof I'll ever need 
 Maybe this is what it means to question You and still believe 
 To search and still be satisfied, to know and yet to wonder why 
 To put my faith things I doubt, to love what I can't figure out, oh 
 Maybe this is what it means 
 To want a miracle, something impossible 
 But have the faith to still believe 
 When You say everything that's right in front of me 
 Is all the proof I'll ever need 
 Don't need a miracle, something impossible 
 That makes You easy to believe 
 When You say everything that's right in front of me 
 Is all the proof I'll ever need 
 You're all the proof I'll ever need 
 So would You help me to believe?

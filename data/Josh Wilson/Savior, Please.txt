Savior, please take my hand 
 I work so hard, I live so fast 
 This life begins, and then it ends 
 And I do the best that I can, but I don't know how long I'll last 
 I try to be so tough 
 But I'm just not strong enough 
 I can't do this alone, God I need You to hold on to me 
 I try to be good enough 
 But I'm nothing without Your love 
 Savior, please keep saving me 
 Savior, please help me stand 
 I fall so hard, I fade so fast 
 Will You begin right where I end 
 And be the God of all I am because You're all I have 
 Hallelujah 
 Everything You are to me 
 Is everything I'll ever need 
 And I am learning to believe 
 That I don't have to prove a thing 
 'Cause You're the one who's saving me

I like to have a plan, I like to sort it out 
 To stay between the lines, to blended in the crowd 
 I like to play it safe, I try to keep control 
 But I hear You call my name and I'm tired of saying 'No' 
 I've been afraid, I'm ready for change 
 I'm gonna put one foot in front of the other 
 I don't need to know where You lead me 
 'Cause You're in control no matter what's coming 
 And on the second-guess God, whatever You ask I will say 'Yes, yes, yes' 
 I'll say 'Yes, yes, yes' 
 I may not see the way, but I still know the truth 
 The fear is just a lie, the faith counter right through 
 It's time to doubt my doubts, it's time to lose control 
 Oh God I'm ready now, just call me and I'll go 
 I'm gonna put one foot in front of the other 
 I don't need to know where You lead me 
 'Cause You're in control no matter what's coming 
 And on the second-guess God, whatever You ask I will say 'Yes, yes, yes' 
 I'll say 'Yes, yes, yes' 
 I'm gonna keep on walking, no matter what the cost is 
 I'm gonna take a breath and I'm gonna say 'Yes' 
 I'm gonna keep on walking, 'No' is not an option 
 I'm gonna take a breath and I'm gonna say 'Yes' 
 I'm gonna put one foot in front of the other 
 I don't need to know where You lead me 
 'Cause You're in control no matter what's coming 
 And on the second-guess, God, whatever You ask I'll say 'Yes, yes, yes' 
 I'll say 'Yes, yes, yes' 
 Just call me and I'll go

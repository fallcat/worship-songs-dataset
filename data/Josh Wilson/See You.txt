Three months hope 
 Hospital bed 
 Fighting hard 
 For every breath 
 The doctor says 
 There's not much chance 
 Mom breaks down once again 
 And I don't know how I'm supposed 
 To see you standing here 
 Somewhere in this mother's tears 
 She cries because her nightmare's coming true 
 Maybe my faith's not that strong 
 Jesus tell me that I'm wrong 
 But there's so much pain in this room 
 And I don't see you 
 Fifteen years 
 Man and wife 
 All it took 
 Was just one night 
 To break those vows 
 And change their lives 
 Now they're wondering if this is goodbye 
 And I don't know how I'm supposed 
 To see you standing here 
 Somewhere in these lovers' tears 
 Two broken hearts that don't know what to do 
 Maybe my faith's not that strong 
 Jesus tell me that I'm wrong 
 But there's so much pain in this room 
 And I don't see You 
 Sometimes I wanna turn my back 
 And shake my fist and run so fast 
 From everything I ever have believed 
 But on the darkest days I won't let go 
 It will still be well within my soul 
 Even when the answers don't come easily 
 'Cause You said You'd never leave 
 So I know You're standing here 
 You've been crying these same tears 
 You've been here all along 
 So give me strength to just hold on 
 Until I see you 
 Until I see you 
 Until I see you 
 Until I see you

Yeah, oh, this city doesn't sleep at night 
 At ten o'clock it comes alive 
 There's 20 million people, then there's me 
 A taxi driver every day 
 A lot of work, a little pay 
 Just looking for a way to find some peace 
 But finding peace is way too hard 
 When you're looking in the dark 
 So shine, shine, shine on us 
 Oh God, we need Your love 
 These streets aren't bright enough 
 Oh Jesus, shine on us, yeah 
 I'm sitting on this corner here 
 My dignity just disappears 
 With every coin I beg into this cup 
 No matter how much people pay 
 It doesn't matter anyway 
 It never ever seems to be enough 
 The light inside my heavy heart 
 Is getting way too dark 
 So shine, shine, shine on us 
 Oh God, we need Your love 
 These streets aren't bright enough 
 Oh Jesus, shine on us 
 (Shine, shine, shine, shine) 
 (Shine) 
 God above is full of mercy 
 (Shine) 
 Turning darkness into dawn 
 (Shine) 
 All you who are weak and weary 
 (Shine) 
 Lift your heads and sing this song 
 Shine, shine, shine on us 
 Oh God, we need Your love 
 These streets aren't bright enough 
 Oh Jesus, shine on us 
 (Shine) 
 Shine, shine, shine on us 
 (Shine) 
 Oh God, we need Your love 
 These streets aren't bright enough 
 Oh God, we need your love 
 These streets aren't bright enough 
 Oh Jesus, shine on us, yeah, yeah

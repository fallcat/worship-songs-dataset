All the words in all the world could never say enough 
 All the notes in my guitar could never play enough 
 But You've placed this song inside my heart 
 And all I know to do for You is sing it 
 No, it's not much, but it's what I've got 
 And all I know to do for You is sing it 
 I have tried so hard to find the perfect melody 
 But nothing I could ever write comes close to Your glory 
 But You've placed this song inside my heart 
 And all I know to do for You is sing it 
 No, it's not much, but it's what I've got 
 And all I know to do for You is sing it

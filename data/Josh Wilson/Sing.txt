Every bit of history and every single breath we breathe 
 Has led us here and brought us to our knees 
 From carrying the curse we bear and praying that He's heard our prayers 
 To set us free, oh, set us free 
 'Cause we could never get back home with broken hearts 
 So home has come to meet us where we are 
 So sing God is with us, sing He has come to save us 
 Sing He will never leave us, glory in the highest 
 Everybody sing to the One who is our King 
 He has come to bring redemption to us, God is with us 
 Glory in the highest, everybody sing 
 We have found our hope again in the Son of God and Son of Man 
 This Savior King is changing all we know 
 By carrying the curse we bear for everybody everywhere 
 He lived and died and brought us life and we will rise to meet Him in the sky 
 So sing God is with us, sing He has come to save us 
 Sing He will never leave us, glory in the highest 
 Everybody sing to the One who is our King 
 He has come to bring redemption to us, God is with us 
 Glory in the highest, everybody sing, everybody sing, sing 
 Jesus, Jesus, our Emmanuel, God is with us now 
 Jesus, Jesus, our Emmanuel, God is with us now 
 'Cause we could never get back home with broken hearts 
 So home has come to us 
 Sing God is with us, sing He has come to save us 
 Sing He will never leave us, glory in the highest 
 Everybody sing to the One who is our King 
 He has come to bring redemption to us, God is with us 
 Glory in the highest, everybody sing 
 God is with us, sing He has come to save us 
 Sing He will never leave us, glory in the highest 
 Everybody sing to the One who is our King 
 He has come to bring redemption to us, god is with us 
 Glory in the highest, everybody sing

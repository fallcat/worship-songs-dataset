I'm thirsty, God I'm thirsty from drinking what destroys me 
 I'm pouring poison in my cup 
 I'm hungry, God I'm hungry consuming what controls me 
 Somehow it never fills me up 
 We all want to find something to pass the time 
 But that could never be enough 
 Everybody says we're all so different 
 But everybody knows we're all the same 
 We're all trying to find a pill to numb the pain 
 Something's got to change 
 Do you remember when you had so much hope within you? 
 It lingers deep inside you still 
 The more of us we swallow, the more we become hollow 
 Until we don't know how to feel 
 We all want to find something to satisfy 
 But we could never be enough 
 Everybody says we're all so different 
 But everybody knows we're all the same 
 We're all trying to find a pill to numb the pain 
 Something's got to change 
 When everything we say and take just leads to war and hate 
 We only pass the blame, sedate the pain and move along 
 But something feels so wrong, so deep inside, so hard to hide 
 So desperately we try and try and come to find 
 That we are not what we've been looking for 
 I can't believe I'm hearing people say that all is well 
 I think it's time we all admit we have no good within ourselves 
 'Cause we are not okay, we're not alright and we need to pray for help 
 Forgive us for our pride, oh God, oh God please save us from ourselves 
 'Cause everybody says we're all so different 
 But everybody knows we're all the same 
 We're all trying to find a pill to numb the pain 
 Something's got to change 
 So God help us 
 Something's got to change 
 Something's got to change 
 So God help us 
 Something's got to change 
 So God help us

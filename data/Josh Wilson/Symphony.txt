It started out in Eden, when He breathed in, 
 To the dust of the ground, 
 Creating the sound of a heartbeat 
 Like the drumbeat to a song. 
 It started out as a solo, a crescendo, 
 To the ends of the Earth, 
 'Til everyone heard the music 
 God is making in us all. 
 And now every breath we breathe, is a melody 
 In the love song to the God who made 
 Every soul to see, every life to bring out 
 The beauty in this world. 
 So come on with all your heart, 
 Lift your voice and play your part 
 In this symphony. 
 Hear it in the laughing, 
 Of an orphan, the very first time 
 He looks in the eyes of the family 
 Who's here to bring him home. 
 Feel it in the silence, in the worship, 
 Of the church underground, 
 They're singing without a sound, somehow. 
 And now every breath we breathe, is a melody 
 In the love song to the God who made 
 Every soul to see, every life to bring out 
 The beauty in this world. 
 So come on with all your heart, 
 Lift your voice and play your part 
 In this symphony. 
 This symphony. 
 So sing with me, 
 Of His majesty, 
 Come on, just sing with me 
 In this symphony. 
 Now every breath we breathe, is a melody 
 In the love song to the God who made 
 Every soul to see, every life to bring out 
 The beauty in this world. 
 So come on with all your heart, 
 Lift your voice and play your part 
 Oh come on with all your heart, 
 Lift your voice and play your part 
 In this symphony. 
 This symphony. 
 This symphony. 
 This symphony.

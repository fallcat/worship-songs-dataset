We used to hide from the light 
 We made friends with the night 
 We were headed the wrong way on a one way track 
 Going nowhere fast 
 We got used to the dark 
 We thought this is who we are 
 And we figured that we were just too far gone 
 But we were wrong 
 'Cause love came running like a river 
 And we got washed in the water 
 Then He said you're forgiven 
 Your sins are gone 
 That was then, this is now 
 You're bought by the blood, saved by the Son the saints all sing about 
 That was lost, this is found 
 And it's time to say goodbye to the old you now 
 So go ahead, put the past in the past 
 Box it up like an old photograph 
 You don't have to go back 
 'Cause that was then and this is now 
 We've been remade by grace 
 We've all got new names 
 And nothing we do could ever change 
 What He did that day 
 When love came running like a river 
 We got washed in the water 
 Then He said you're forgiven 
 And you belong 
 That was then, this is now 
 You're bought by the blood, saved by the Son the saints all sing about 
 That was lost, this is found 
 And it's time to say goodbye to the old you now 
 So go ahead, put the past in the past 
 Box it up like an old photograph 
 You don't have to go back 
 'Cause that was then 
 If we turn and confess every unrighteousness 
 He is faithful and just to forgive 
 Oh, so turn and confess every wrong and regret 
 And see what it means to live 
 That was then, this is now 
 You're bought by the blood, saved by the Son the saints all sing about 
 That was lost, this is found 
 And it's time to say goodbye to the old you now 
 So go ahead, put the past in the past 
 Box it up like an old photograph 
 You don't have to go back 
 'Cause that was then and this is now 
 'Cause that was then and this is now

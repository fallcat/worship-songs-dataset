To those whose steps aren't steady 
 To those whose hearts are heavy 
 To those whose faith is all but gone 
 To those that struggle on, struggle on 
 Oh, come and lay your burdens down 
 Come and lift your empty hands 
 You are not alone, we are not alone 
 So hold on 
 To all the saints that keep on praying 
 And all the children that keep on waiting 
 And all those that sing the Savior's song 
 Lift your heads up and keep on living 
 Hold tight to the hope we are given 
 For we know that we won't be waiting long 
 I know we won't be waiting long 
 Can you hear the music playing? 
 Can you feel the dream is waking? 
 We are running towards redemption, yeah 
 We are never standing still 
 Through the problems and the pain 
 Through the striving and the strain 
 You are not alone, we are not alone 
 So hold on 
 To all the saints that keep on praying 
 And all the children that keep on waiting 
 And all those that sing the Savior's song 
 Lift your heads up and keep on living 
 Hold tight to the hope we are given 
 For we know that we won't be waiting long 
 I know we won't be waiting long 
 He is coming soon, He is coming soon 
 He will take His bride, He will make her new 
 He is coming soon, He is coming soon 
 To carry us home 
 He is coming soon, He is coming soon 
 He will take His bride, He will make her new 
 He is coming soon, He is coming soon 
 To carry us home 
 He is coming soon, He is coming soon

 To carry us home 
 To all the saints that keep on praying 
 And all the children that keep on waiting

You say 
 With a mustard seed of faith 
 That I can make the mountain move 
 Sometimes 
 I am so afraid 
 Even though I know it's true 
 Because my faith feels just like doubt 
 I don't know what to pray right now 
 Oh I believe 
 Please help my unbelief 
 Jesus give me grace 
 To trust what I can't see 
 Your ways are not my own 
 Some things I'll never know 
 But you say blessed are the ones who never see 
 They just believe 
 So now 
 With a heart full of questions 
 I come to you just as I am 
 All my weakness 
 All my fears 
 All I've run from all these years 
 In the middle of my doubt 
 Some that still I'm finding out 
 I believe 
 Please help my unbelief 
 Jesus give me grace 
 To trust what I can't see 
 Your ways are not my own 
 Some things I'll never know 
 But you say blessed are the ones who never see 
 They just believe 
 When my faith feels just like doubt 
 I believe 
 Oh I believe 
 Oh I believe 
 Please help my unbelief 
 Jesus give me grace 
 To trust what I can't see 
 Your ways are not my own 
 Some things I'll never know 
 But you say blessed are the ones who never see 
 They just believe 
 But you say blessed are the ones who never see 
 They just believe

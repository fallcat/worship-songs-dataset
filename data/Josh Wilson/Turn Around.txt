I'm ready to fall in love 
 So what are you running from? 
 Well, I'm what you're looking for, quit looking for yourself 
 Well, I'm right behind you, why are you looking somewhere else? 
 Would you turn, would you turn, would you turn around? 
 Would it be that hard to do? 
 If you turned, if you turned, if you turned around 
 I'd be right in front of you 
 You're searching for something more, something more 
 And you're walking right out my door, walk right out, out the door 
 You're leaving home to look for the home you have with me 
 Like flying around the world to get across the street 
 Would you turn, would you turn, would you turn around? 
 Would it be that hard to do? 
 If you turned, if you turned, if you turned around 
 I'd be right in front of you 
 Quit over thinking love, stop thing that I'm not enough 
 'Cause you don't need anything that you don't have here with me 
 Would you turn, would you turn, would you turn around? 
 Would it be that hard to do? 
 If you turned, if you turned, if you turned around 
 Could you turn, would you turn, would you turn around? 
 Would it be that hard to do? 
 If you turned, if you turned, if you turned around 
 Well, I'd be right in front of you 
 You are over thinking love, stop thing that I'm not enough 
 'Cause you don't need anything 'cause I'm right in front of you 
 Oh I'm right in front of you, oh I'm right in front of you

Where have I been all my life? 
 What have I done with my time? 
 What ever happened to me? 
 How long have I been asleep? 
 Wake, wake me up, wake me up, 
 Wake me up inside. 
 Light up my heart with a spark 
 From Your burning light. 
 God please just wake me up 
 I wanna rise from the dead 
 And feel this heart beat again 
 Don't wanna waste one more day 
 Lord do whatever it takes 
 To wake, wake me up, wake me up, 
 Wake me up inside. 
 Light up my heart with a spark 
 From Your burning light. 
 God please just wake me up 
 Let Your love, let Your love 
 Open up my eyes. 
 Light up my heart with a spark 
 From Your burning light. 
 God please just wake me up 
 I can hear You calling out my name 
 I will rise, I will rise and be remade 
 Oh and I will never be the same 
 I will rise, I will rise and be remade 
 Wake, wake me up, wake me up 
 Wake me up inside. 
 Light up my heart with a spark 
 From Your burning light. 
 God please, God please 
 Wake, wake me up, wake me up 
 Wake me up inside. 
 Light up my heart with a spark 
 From Your burning light. 
 God please just wake me up 
 Let Your love, let Your love 
 Open up my eyes. 
 Light up my heart with a spark 
 From Your burning light. 
 God please just wake me up 
 I can hear You calling out my name 
 I will rise, I will rise and be remade 
 Oh and I will never be the same 
 I will rise, I will rise and be remade 
 Where have I been all my life?

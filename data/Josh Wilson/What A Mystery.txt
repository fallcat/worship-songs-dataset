There was a garden, there was a man, 
 He was so lonely, but God had a plan, 
 God had a plan. 
 He fell asleep but, never could dream, 
 He'd wake up to the most beautiful thing 
 He'd ever seen. 
 But there she was, and there you are. 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 What a mystery 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 Somehow you and me 
 Are a picture of a greater love 
 That someday we will see 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 Oh, what a mystery 
 The good Lord is working to make my heart new, 
 And I am more like Him when I'm with you, 
 When I'm with you. 
 Oh, you are so patient, you are so kind, 
 You are my favorite way that God shows His light in my life. 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 What a mystery 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 Somehow you and me 
 Are a picture of a greater love 
 That someday we will see 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 Yeah, what a mystery 
 And day by day we'll chip away 
 All the things that don't belong, 
 Every shadow, every wrong, 
 Until we find deep down inside 
 The glory we forgot, the image of our God. 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 What a mystery 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 Yea somehow you and me 
 Are a picture of a greater love 
 That someday we will see 
 (Woah oh oh oh) 
 Oh, what a mystery

If I could go back to the seventh grade 
 I'd tell myself, you'll be OK. 
 You're the last one picked and the first one out, 
 But wouldn't let it get you down. 
 Middle school is a lonely road, 
 You're faking sick to stay at home. 
 But give it time and you will find 
 Friends you'll have for your whole life. 
 Ooh you're gonna make it through 
 I promise that you'll do somehow. 
 I wish you could see what I see now. 
 If I could go back to 23, 
 To the nights I cried myself to sleep. 
 Lying in my bed alone, 
 With nobody to have and hold. 
 I'd say that I know the feeling well, 
 When the girl you love loves someone else. 
 But give it time and you will find 
 A lover who won't leave your side. 
 Ooh you're gonna make it through 
 I promise that you'll do somehow. 
 I wish you could see what I see now. 
 I see a perfect plan, I see God's guiding hand. 
 I see a better man, you'll be a better man. 
 Sometimes it takes a while, sometimes it takes the trials 
 To open up your eyes. 
 So here I am at 29, 
 But I feel just like that boy sometimes. 
 Praying, please God give me faith, 
 To make it through just one more day. 
 But every time I have those fears, 
 I think of me in twenty years, 
 Telling me, you'll be just fine, 
 Just keep on walking towards the light. 
 Just keep on walking towards the light. 
 Yeah, you'll be just fine 
 Just give it time, give it time 
 Ooh 
 Oh, just keep on walking towards the light.

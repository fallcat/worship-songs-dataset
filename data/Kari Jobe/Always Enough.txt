I lift my hands to the highest of all 
 As I draw near 
 Surrender my life to Your promise, oh God 
 There is no other 
 I will find my life in You 
 You're always enough 
 Always enough 
 Let the fullness of your love 
 Be all I need 
 All I need 
 Consume me, come like a fire oh God 
 Reign in me 
 For You alone will satisfy 
 There is no other 
 I will find my life in You 
 You're always enough 
 Always enough 
 Let the fullness of your love 
 Be all I need 
 All I need 
 If I have you 
 I have everything 
 But without you 
 I have nothing 
 I will find my life in You 
 You're always enough 
 Always enough 
 Let the fullness of your love 
 Be all I need 
 All I need

He is here for the broken and life to the one who is undone 
 He is peace to the wounded and hope for the helpless one 
 He is here, He is here 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 Wait patiently upon the Lord 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 When the waves rise against me and the wind tries to draw me away 
 I will stand on the mountain, safe in Your arms I will sing I will sing 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 Wait patiently upon the Lord 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 Be still I know He is God 
 He is here, He is here 
 Be still I know He is God 
 He is here, He is here 
 So be still my soul, be still 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 Wait patiently upon the Lord 
 Be still my soul, be still 
 Wait patiently upon the Lord 
 Be still my soul, be still

Here before Your alter 
 I am letting go of all I've held 
 Of every motive, every burden 
 Everything that's of myself 
 And I just wanna wait on You, my God 
 I just wanna dwell on who You are 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Oh, I am lost for more to say 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Oh Lord You're beautiful to me 
 Here in Your presence 
 I am not afraid of brokenness 
 To wash Your feet with humble tears 
 I would be poured out till nothing's left 
 And I just wanna wait on You, my God 
 I just wanna dwell on who You are 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Oh, I am lost for more to say 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Oh Lord You're beautiful to me 
 Beautiful 
 You're beautiful, oh You're beautiful 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Holy, holy, holy You are, You are 
 Holy, holy, holy You are, You are 
 Holy, holy, holy You are, You are 
 Holy, holy, holy You are, You are 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Oh, I am lost for more to say 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Oh Lord You're beautiful to me 
 You're beautiful 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Beautiful, beautiful 
 Beautiful

There is a shaking 
 Let hearts awaken 
 Our God is moving 
 Forever changing us 
 There is a trembling 
 There is revival 
 The sound of worship 
 So great and glorious 
 Holy Spirit hear us now 
 Breathe on us 
 Holy fire fall 
 Come and fill this place with Your presence 
 Like a rushing wind 
 Send Your spirit here 
 Breath of Heaven breathe on us 
 Breath of Heaven breathe on us 
 Lift up your hands and shout 
 The Lord is with us now 
 Lift up your voice and sing 
 He is Holy

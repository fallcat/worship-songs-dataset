Come to me, you weary one. 
 And I will give you rest. 
 I will give you rest. 
 Come to me, you weary one. 
 And I will give you rest. 
 I will give you rest. 
 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. 
 Take me upon you, I will give you rest. 
 Come to me, you broken one. 
 And I will give you peace. 
 I will give you peace. 
 Come to me, you broken one. 
 And I will give you peace. 
 I will give you peace. 
 I will calm your waters, and I will whisper, 
 "Peace be still." 
 Take me upon you, I will give you peace. 
 Come to me, you burdened one. 
 And I will give you joy. 
 I will give you joy. 
 Come to me, you burdened one. 
 And I will give you joy. 
 I will give you joy. 
 You will rise like eagles, and my joy will be your strength. 
 Take me upon you, I will give you joy. 
 Come to me (x3) 
 I have been waiting for you here. 
 He has been waiting for you here. 
 Come. Come to Him. 
 Come and find your peace. 
 Come and find your rest. 
 Come and find your joy. 
 He is waiting here for you. 
 He is waiting here for you with open arms, 
 To hold you, to embrace your heart, to love you. 
 He is waiting here. (x2)

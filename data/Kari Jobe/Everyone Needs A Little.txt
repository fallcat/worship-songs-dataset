Come all ye weary and ye broken 
 Come to the table of the Lord 
 Come sing the song of the forgiven 
 Come lay your burden on the word 
 Come and find peace 
 Everyone needs a little rest 
 Everyone needs a little joy 
 And a song to sing in the darkest night 
 And life even when it gets you down 
 Hope will turn it all around 
 But love is the greatest of these 
 Everyone needs a little 
 Sing all ye saints and ye sinners 
 Call upon the mercy of the Lord 
 Come sing the song of redemption 
 Sing about the hope that is to come 
 Come and find peace 
 Everyone needs a little rest 
 Everyone needs a little joy 
 And a song to sing in the darkest night 
 And life even when it gets you down 
 Hope will turn it all around 
 But love is the greatest of these 
 Everyone needs a little 
 He will lift you up 
 He will lift you up higher than sorrow 
 He will lift you up 
 And cover your soul with healing 
 Come and find peace 
 Everyone needs a little rest 
 Everyone needs a little joy 
 And a song to sing in the darkest night 
 And life even when it gets you down 
 Hope will turn it all around 
 But love is the greatest of these 
 Everyone needs a little 
 Peace 
 Everyone needs a little rest 
 Everyone needs a little joy 
 And a song to sing in the darkest night 
 And life even when it gets you down 
 Hope will turn it all around 
 But love is the greatest of these 
 Everyone needs a little 
 Everyone needs a little 
 Everyone needs a little

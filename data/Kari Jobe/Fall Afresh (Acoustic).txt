Let this be a place where You long to come 
 As we make a way for Your love 
 Let these hands be clean and this heart be pure 
 Blameless as the bride You're coming for 
 It's the power of Your presence that changes us 
 Your glory all around us and we're undone 
 You open up the heavens and fall afresh on us 
 Let this be a house where You long to stay 
 Ever will You meet us face to face 
 Abandoned here before You we want nothing else 
 Than just to be with You and You alone 
 Holy Spirit fill this heart again 
 Holy Spirit burn life fire within 
 Fall afresh on us

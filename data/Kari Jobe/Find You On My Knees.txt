Trouble's chasing me again 
 Breaking down my best defense 
 I'm looking 
 God I'm looking for your 
 Weary just won't let me rest 
 And fear is filling up my head 
 I'm longing 
 God I'm longing for you 
 But I will 
 Find You in the place I'm in 
 Find You when I'm at my end 
 Find You when there's nothing left of me to offer You 
 Except for brokenness 
 You lift me up 
 You never leave me thirsty 
 When I am weak 
 When I am lost and searching 
 I find You on my knees 
 So what if sorrow shakes my faith? 
 What if heartache still remains? 
 I'll trust You 
 My God I'll trust You 
 'Cause You are faithful 
 And I will 
 Find You in the place I'm in 
 Find You when I'm at my end 
 Find You when there's nothing left of me to offer You 
 Except for brokenness 
 You lift me up 
 You never leave me thirsty 
 When I am weak 
 When I am lost and searching 
 I find You on my knees 
 When my hope is gone 
 When the fear is strong 
 When the pain is real 
 When it's hard to heal 
 When my faith is shaken 
 And my heart is broken 
 And my joy is stolen 
 God I know that You lift me up 
 You never leave me searching

The moon and stars they wept 
 The morning sun was dead 
 The Savior of the world was fallen 
 His body on the cross 
 His blood poured out for us 
 The weight of every curse upon him 
 One final breath He gave 
 As Heaven looked away 
 The Son of God was laid in darkness 
 A battle in the grave 
 The war on death was waged 
 The power of hell forever broken 
 The ground began to shake 
 The stone was rolled away 
 His perfect love could not be overcome 
 Now death where is your sting 
 Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated 
 Forever, He is glorified 
 Forever, He is lifted high 
 Forever, He is risen 
 He is alive 
 He is alive 
 The ground began to shake 
 The stone was rolled away 
 His perfect love could not be overcome 
 Now death where is your sting 
 Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated 
 Forever, He is glorified 
 Forever, He is lifted high 
 Forever, He is risen 
 He is alive 
 He is alive 
 Forever, forever 
 You have overcome 
 Your resurrected King 
 You have overcome the grave 
 You have overcome

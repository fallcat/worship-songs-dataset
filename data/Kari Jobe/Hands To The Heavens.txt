We are Your church 
 We are Your sons and daughters 
 We've gathered here to meet with You 
 We lift our eyes 
 We lay our hearts before You 
 Expectant here for You to move 
 With our hands to the Heavens 
 Alive in Your presence 
 Oh God, when You come 
 So pour out Your Spirit 
 We love to be near You 
 Oh God, when You come 
 You are the way 
 The truth and life we live for 
 Oh how we long to know You more 
 Come like a rushing wind 
 Come light the fire again 
 Come like a burning flame 
 Have Your way 
 Have Your way

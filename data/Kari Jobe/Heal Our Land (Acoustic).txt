You take our lives 
 Flawed, yet beautiful 
 Restore, refine 
 Lord, You're merciful 
 Redeem, revive 
 Spirit of God 
 Breathe on Your church 
 Pour out Your presence 
 Speak through Your word 
 We pray in every nation, Christ be known 
 Our hope and salvation, Christ alone 
 New power, new wine 
 As divisions fall 
 One church, one bride 
 Jesus, Lord of all 
 With one voice we cry 
 Spirit of God 
 Breathe on Your church 
 Pour out Your presence 
 Speak through Your word 
 We pray in every nation, Christ be known 
 Our hope and salvation, Christ alone 
 So, God we pray to You 
 Humble ourselves again 
 Lord, would You hear our cry 
 Lord, will You heal our land 
 That every eye will see 
 That every heart will know 
 The One who took our sin 
 The One who died and rose 
 And when Your kingdom comes 
 And when at last You call 
 We'll rise to worship You alone 
 Spirit of God 
 Breathe on Your church 
 Pour out Your presence 
 Speak through Your word 
 We pray in every nation, Christ be known 
 Our hope and salvation, Christ alone 
 Spirit of God 
 Breathe on Your church 
 Pour out Your presence 
 Speak through Your word 
 We pray in every nation, Christ be known 
 Our hope and salvation, Christ alone

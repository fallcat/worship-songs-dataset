Come and rest here 
 Come and lay your burdens down 
 Come and rest here 
 There is refuge for you now 
 You'll find his peace 
 And know you're not alone anymore 
 He is near 
 You'll find his healing 
 You're heart isn't shattered anymore 
 He is here 
 Breathe in 
 Breathe out 
 You will 
 You will find him here 
 I will rest in you 
 You will find him 
 You will find him here 
 You will find him 
 You will find him here

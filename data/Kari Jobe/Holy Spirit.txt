There's nothing worth more that will ever come close 
 No thing can compare, You're our living hope 
 Your presence, Lord 
 And I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of loves 
 Where my heart becomes free and my shame is undone

 Holy Spirit, You are welcome here 
 Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere 
 Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for 
 To be overcome by Your presence, Lord

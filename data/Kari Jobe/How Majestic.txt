Without a word 
 The mountains speak 
 The song that all creation sings 
 The painted skies 
 The sun and stars 
 The Heavens tell how great You are 
 The Heavens tell how great You are 
 How majestic is Your name 
 How majestic is Your name 
 Jesus wonderful, powerful 
 You're the Lord of all 
 How majestic is Your name 
 A rugged cross 
 A humble King 
 How beautiful the mystery 
 That love would bleed from majesty 
 All rise, all rise in highest praise 
 Your name will reign through all eternity 
 Our hope, our strength, our victory 
 We bow down, down at Your feet

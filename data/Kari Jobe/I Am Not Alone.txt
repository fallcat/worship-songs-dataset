When I walk through deep waters 
 I know that You will be with me 
 When I'm standing in the fire 
 I will not be overcome 
 Through the valley of shadows 
 I will not fear 
 I am not alone 
 I am not alone 
 You will go before me 
 You will never leave me 
 In midst of deep sorrow 
 I see your light is breaking through 
 The dark of night will not overtake me 
 I am pressing into You 
 Lord, you fight my every battle 
 And I will not fear 
 I am not alone 
 I am not alone 
 You will go before me 
 You will never leave me 
 You amaze me, redeem me 
 You call me as Your own 
 You're my strength, You're my defender 
 You're my refuge in the storm 
 Through these trials, You've always been faithful 
 You bring healing to my soul 
 I am not alone 
 I am not alone 
 You will go before me 
 You will never leave me

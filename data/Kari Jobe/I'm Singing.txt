Only one name lasts forever 
 Only one fame stands alone 
 Only one King has an anthem 
 That goes on and on and on 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who brings redemption to the nations 
 Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who wrote the book on our salvation 
 To the One who covers me in grace 
 I'm singing 
 Only one word in the beginning 
 Only one truth will prevail 
 Only one love brings a freedom 
 Only one Man took the nails 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who brings redemption to the nations 
 Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who wrote the book on our salvation 
 To the One who covers me in grace 
 I'm singing 
 Praise, praise to the Savior 
 Praise to the Lamb of God 
 Praise in all of His splendor 
 Praise for saving my life 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who brings redemption to the nations 
 Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who wrote the book on our salvation 
 To the One who covers me in grace 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who brings redemption to the nations 
 Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise 
 And I'm singing to the God 
 Who wrote the book on our salvation 
 To the One who covers me in grace 
 To the One who covers me in grace 
 I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing

Jesus... Lover of my soul, 
 All consuming fire is in Your gaze, 
 Jesus, I want You to know, 
 I will follow You all of my life, 
 There's no one else in history is like You, 
 And history itself belongs to You, 
 Oh, Alpha and Omega, You have loved me, 
 And I will share eternity with You, 
 It's all about You, Jesus, 
 And all is for You, 
 For Your glory and Your faith, 
 It's not about me (oh no) 
 As in You should do things Your way; 
 You alone are God and I surrender, (You alone are God) 
 You alone are God and I surrender, (You alone, you alone) 
 You are alone are God and I surrender... To Your will (only to You Lord) 
 (It's all about You)

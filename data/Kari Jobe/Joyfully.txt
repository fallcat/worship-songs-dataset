You lead me by the waters still 
 You lay me down to rest upon your faithfulness 
 My Shepherd, simply take my hand 
 Your song restores my soul 
 For Your name, You make me whole 
 Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee 
 With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high 
 Your Majesty gently washes over me 
 Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully 
 No shadow ever shall I fear 
 Your peace, my heart will know 
 My cup it overflows 
 Your goodness chases after me 
 Your mercy and Your grace will be my dwelling place 
 Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee 
 With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high 
 Your Majesty gently washes over me 
 Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully 
 I will sing from the mountain top 
 I will sing, I am overcome, I will sing making melodies 
 I will sing from the valley low 
 I will sing because of Your love I will sing 
 You're my King, I will sing 
 Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee 
 With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high 
 Your Majesty gently washes over me 
 Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully 
 Joyfully, joyfully, joyfully

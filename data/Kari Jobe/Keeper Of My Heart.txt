From the first to the last breath I breathe 
 The Lord watches over me 
 You hear my cry and You know every need 
 The Lord watches over me 
 You never failed me, God 
 I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up 
 Maker of the heavens, keeper of my heart 
 I lift my hands, I lift my hands up 
 Standing in Your presence, You are never far 
 I look to You, where my help comes from 
 The Lord watches over me 
 Your mercies are new with the morning sun 
 The Lord watches over me 
 You never failed me, God 
 I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up 
 Maker of the heavens, keeper of my heart 
 I lift my hands, I lift my hands up 
 Standing in Your presence, You are never far 
 Keeper of my heart 
 Keeper of my heart 
 Jesus, You are 
 My strength in never ending love 
 I know You have overcome 
 I'll sing when all is said and done 
 You're my hope, my only hope 
 I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes up 
 Maker of the heavens, keeper of my heart 
 I lift my hands, I lift my hands up 
 Standing in Your presence, You are never far 
 Keeper of my heart 
 Keeper of my heart 
 Jesus, You are

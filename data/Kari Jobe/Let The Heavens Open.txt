You are welcome in this place 
 Welcome in our hearts 
 Come and have Your way 
 God, meet us face to face 
 All consuming fire 
 Move without restraint 
 Breathe on us 
 Spirit come 
 You're our heart's desire 
 We stand in the glory of the King 
 Knowing that You're here 
 You have set us free 
 You're here 
 Let our worship be Your throne 
 Amazed by who You are 
 Your presence makes us whole 
 Let the Heavens open 
 Let Your Kingdom move 
 All our faith and hope in 
 Our great God

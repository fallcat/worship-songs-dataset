Look upon the Lord 
 Stand in awe of His beauty 
 Look upon the Lord 
 Seated high, He is Holy 
 Let the glory of our God from Heaven come down 
 Let the house of the Lord be filled with the cloud 
 You are good and Your mercy will endure 
 You are good and forever we are Yours 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Listen for the Lord 
 Hear the voice of His spirit 
 Call upon His name 
 He is near 
 He is with us 
 Let the glory of our God from Heaven come down 
 Let the house of the Lord be filled with the cloud 
 You are good and Your mercy will endure 
 You are good and forever we are Yours 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Holy, holy 
 With one voice heaven and earth are singing 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God almighty 
 Holy, holy 
 With one voice heaven and earth are singing 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God almighty 
 Holy, holy 
 With one voice heaven and earth are singing 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God almighty 
 Holy, holy 
 With one voice heaven and earth are singing 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God almighty 
 Let the glory of our God from Heaven come down 
 Let the house of the Lord be filled with the cloud

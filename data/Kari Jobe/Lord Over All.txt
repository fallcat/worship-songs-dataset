In the valley of the unknown 
 I will lift my voice 
 In the shifting, in the shadow 
 I know You are with me 
 In the valley of the unknown 
 I will lift my voice In the shifting, in the shadow 
 I know You are with me 
 Lord over all 
 You will be my rescue 
 You will never fail 
 Lord, through it all 
 I will choose to trust You 
 You will never fail 
 In the searching and the waiting 
 You quiet my soul 
 In the stillness of Your presence 
 I know You are with me 
 Lord over all 
 You will be my rescue 
 You will never fail 
 Lord, through it all 
 I will choose to trust 
 You You will never fail 
 Lord over all 
 You will be my rescue 
 You will never fail 
 Lord, through it all 
 I will choose to trust You 
 You will never fail 
 Out of this darkness 
 Into Your promise 
 You will deliver me 
 Eternal Savior 
 You stand forever 
 You are my victory 
 Out of this darkness 
 Into Your promise 
 You will deliver me 
 Eternal Savior 
 You stand forever 
 You are my victory 
 Lord over all 
 You will be my rescue 
 You will never fail 
 Lord, through it all 
 I will choose to trust You 
 You will never fail 
 Lord over all 
 You will be my rescue 
 You will never fail 
 Lord, through it all 
 I will choose to trust You 
 You will never fail 
 You will never fail 
 You will never fail 
 You will never fail 
 You will never fail 
 You will never fail 
 You will never fail 
 You will never fail...

If my heart is overwhelmed 
 And I cannot hear your voice 
 I hold on to what is true 
 Though I cannot see 
 If the storms of life they come 
 And the road ahead gets steep 
 I will lift these hands in faith 
 I will believe 
 I'll remind myself 
 Of all that you've done 
 And the life I have 
 Because of your son 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 I am yours 
 Lord I'm forever yours 
 Mountains high or valley low 
 I sing out and remind my soul 
 I am yours 
 I am forever yours 
 When my heart is filled with hope 
 Every promise comes my way 
 When I feel your hands of grace 
 Rest upon me 
 Staying desperate for you, god 
 Staying humble at your feet 
 I will lift these hands in praise 
 I will believe 
 I'll remind myself 
 Of all that you've done 
 And the life I have 
 Because of your son 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 I am yours 
 I am forever yours 
 Mountains high or valley low 
 I sing out and remind my soul 
 I am yours 
 I am forever yours 
 I am yours 
 I am yours 
 All my days 
 Jesus, I am yours 
 I am yours 
 I am yours 
 All my days 
 Jesus, I am yours 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 I am yours 
 I am forever yours 
 Mountains high or valley low 
 I sing out and remind my soul 
 I am yours 
 I am forever yours 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 I am yours 
 I am forever yours 
 Mountains high or valley low 
 I sing out and remind my soul 
 I am yours 
 I am forever yours 
 Yeah, I am yours, I'm yours, I am yours 
 Jesus I am yours

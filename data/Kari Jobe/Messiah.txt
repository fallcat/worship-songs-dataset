The world is waiting 
 For a baby's cry 
 The promised moment 
 Is tonight 
 Shepherds watching 
 Angels Sing 
 Wisemen marvel at their King 
 Messiah has been born to us 
 A child, Heavens glorious 
 Perfect love, anointed one 
 Messiah, our Messiah 
 Has come 
 Mother smiling 
 Such little hands 
 Father's holding 
 The son of man 
 Messiah has been born to us 
 A child, Heaven's glorious 
 Perfect love, anointed one 
 Messiah, our Messiah 
 Hallelujah, Glory to God 
 Hallelujah, there's no greater love 
 Hallelujah, Oh Glory to God 
 Hallelujah, our Messiah has come 
 Precious Saviour 
 Blessed one 
 Peace for sinners 
 Behold the lamb of God 
 Messiah has been born to us 
 A child, Heaven's glorious 
 Perfect love, anointed one 
 Messiah, our Messiah 
 Messiah has been born to us 
 A child, Heaven's glorious 
 Perfect love, anointed one 
 Messiah, Our Messiah 
 Messiah, Our Messiah 
 Has come

You're My Beloved 
 You're My Bride 
 To sing over you is My delight 
 Come away with Me My love 
 You're Beautiful to Me 
 So beautiful to Me 
 Under My mercy 
 Come and wait 
 Till we are standing face to face 
 I see no stain on you 
 My child 
 You're Beautiful to Me 
 So Beautiful to Me 
 I sing over you My song of peace 
 Cast all your care down at My feet 
 Come and find your rest in Me 
 I'll breathe My life inside of you 
 I'll bear you up on eagle's wings 
 And hide you in the shadow of My strength 
 I'll take you to My quiet waters 
 I'll restore your soul 
 Come rest in Me and be made whole 
 You're My beloved 
 You're My Bride 
 To sing over you is my delight 
 Come away with me my love

No sweeter name than the Name of Jesus, 
 No sweeter name have I ever known 
 No sweeter name than the name of Jesus. 
 You are the Life to my heart and my soul 
 You are the Light to the darkness around me 
 You are the Hope to the hopeless and broken 
 You are the only Truth and the Way 
 Jesus, Jesus

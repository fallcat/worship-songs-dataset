Here I am 
 Just for You, only You 
 Here I stand 
 Wanting You, only You 
 In Your presence Lord 
 I will find my strength 
 You're the breath in me 
 You're my everything 
 With my heart bowed low 
 And my hands held high 
 All consuming fire 
 You're my one desire 
 Your name, oh Your name 
 Let it stay on my lips 
 I will seek Your face 
 God, it's You, only You 
 In Your presence Lord 
 I will find my strength 
 You're the breath in me 
 You're my everything 
 With my heart bowed low 
 And my hands held high 
 All consuming fire 
 You're my one desire 
 In Your presence Lord 
 I will find my strength 
 You're the breath in me 
 You're my everything 
 With my heart bowed low 
 And my hands held high 
 All consuming fire 
 You're my one desire 
 It's You, God, it's You 
 It's You, only You 
 My heart will always sing 
 I love You, I love You 
 My heart will always sing 
 I love You, I love You 
 My heart will always sing 
 I love You, I love You 
 My heart will always sing 
 I love You, I love You

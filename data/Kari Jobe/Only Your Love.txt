Your love is strong and mighty 
 It's jealousy unyielding 
 It burns for me like a fire untamed 
 Your love is all consuming 
 You never stop pursuing 
 Nothing I could face could take it away 
 Oh, oh, oh Your Love 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Your love is like no other 
 Nothing else satisfies 
 It flows through the deepest waters 
 It rests on the mountains high 
 Your love is overwhelming 
 Brought me to life again 
 Your love, it will last forever 
 In You there'll be no end 
 Only Your love 
 Only Your love 
 Only Your love 
 Nothing can separate us 
 Many trials cannot hide Your love 
 No sorrow could wash it away 
 How deep 
 How wide 
 How long 
 How high

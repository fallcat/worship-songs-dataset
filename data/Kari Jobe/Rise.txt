Lead us to you 
 Show us your mercy 
 Your majesty lifted up on high 
 It tells of your goodness 
 Your name is true 
 Your name is holy 
 Your splendor is written in the skies 
 It tells of your greatness 
 We will rise 
 To praise you 
 Offer our lives before you 
 Let every nation, all of creation 
 We will rise 
 You are worthy 
 Lift up our eyes to your glory 
 Let every nation, all of creation 
 We will rise 
 We stand in awe 
 You won the victory 
 Your enemies tremble at your name 
 It speaks of your triumph 
 You clothe the poor 
 You mend the broken 
 You heal our hearts 
 You take our shame 
 It speaks of your kindness 
 We will cry out your renown 
 You are the god who has saved us 
 We will rise to praise you 
 We lift a glorious sound 
 You are the one who redeemed us 
 We will rise to praise you

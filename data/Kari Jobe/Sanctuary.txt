People, places 
 Names and faces 
 They come and they go, leaving traces 
 Sometimes my world gets filled with so much noise 
 That my heart gets pulled away 
 But I find my peace in you 
 And if I seek, I will find. 
 A treasure in you that time can't take away. 
 Sanctuary 
 Pure and holy 
 In a secret place I'll find you there. 
 Sanctuary 
 Pure and holy 
 In a secret place I'll find you there. 
 I'll find you there 
 (Repeat verse and chorus) 
 Oh to be washed in the water of your holy words 
 And oh to be healed by the touch of your hands 
 In your sanctuary 
 Pure and holy 
 In a secret room I'll find you there. 
 Sanctuary 
 Pure and holy 
 In the secret room I'll find you there. 
 I'll find you there

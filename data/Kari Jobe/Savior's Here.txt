You bring hope 
 You bring life 
 Awaken hearts open eyes 
 With our voices hidden eyes 
 We call these dry bones to come alive 
 You are faithful you are truth 
 We can always run to 
 Love that never fails 
 Arms that never close 
 Blood with cover sin 
 Grace that never ends 
 You have saved us 
 You have won 
 City's broken 
 Death is gone 
 Freedom is found 
 Breakthrough is near 
 In your presence 
 No more fear 
 Our savior's here 
 Our savior's here 
 Faith is stirring 
 Hearts are free 
 Chains are broken and we believe 
 You are mighty you come through 
 We can always run to 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Our god save 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Our god save 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Our god save 
 Savior's here our savior's here savior's here 
 You open the blind eyes open the blind eyes 
 Heal or sickness you are there 
 You open my blind eyes gave me a new life 
 Oh yeah, our savior's here

When I waited so long, when my tears were my song 
 With my hope nearly gone You held me God 
 To believe in the face of the dry, weary place 
 When You felt far away You held me God 
 Oh, there is freedom in surrender, oh I know it 
 Your songs have never stopped 
 You've been singing, always singing over me 
 Your words are still enough 
 And You're singing, always singing over me 
 The chaos in the cause teaching me to see Lord 
 The beauty in the storm so I believe 
 When I see through Your eyes through the testing of time 
 Every cloud silver lined 'cause You're with me 
 Oh, there is freedom in surrender, oh I know it 
 Your songs have never stopped 
 You've been singing, always singing over me 
 Your words are still enough 
 And You're singing 
 Give me faith 
 Give me strength enough to wait 
 To stand in faith 
 And listen for, listen for Your melody 
 Your songs have never stopped 
 Your songs have never stopped 
 Your songs have never stopped 
 You've been singing, always singing over me 
 Your words are still enough 
 And You're singing, always singing over me 
 Your songs have never stopped 
 You've been singing, always singing over me 
 Your words are still enough 
 And You're singing, always singing over me 
 Always singing over me, always singing over me 
 Always singing over me

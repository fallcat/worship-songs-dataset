Take the sun 
 Take the moon 
 Take the earth and watch it move 
 Under your control 
 'Cause you're all I know 
 Here's my life and all my heart 
 I give it all but every part 
 Is under your control 
 Lord you're all I know 
 The stars in the sky will hang there 
 Till you tell them to 
 The faith in my heart will still sing 
 Of what your love can do 
 And even when life weighs heavy on me 
 I know you're in control 
 And you're all I need 
 The stars in the sky will hang there 
 Till you tell them to 
 Take the sea 
 Take the tide 
 Take the waters watch them rise 
 Giving praise to you 
 Always praising you 
 Here's my voice 
 And all my soul 
 Singing freely when 
 Lord, I'm giving praise to you 
 Lord I'm praising you 
 The clouds will rain 
 The seasons change 
 (Cause you told them to) 
 The sun will shine 
 Your burning light 
 (Cause you told it to) 
 When you speak your words through my soul 
 So I know it's true 
 You're in control 
 In control 
 In control 
 The stars in the sky will hang there 
 The faith in my heart will sting sing 
 The stars in the sky will hang there

Wish it could be easy 
 Why is life so messy 
 Why is pain part of us? 
 There are days I feel like 
 Nothing ever goes right 
 Sometimes it just hurts so much 
 But you're here, you're real 
 I know I can trust you 
 Even when it hurts 
 Even when it's hard 
 Even when it all just falls apart 
 I will run to you 
 'Cause I know that you are 
 Lover of my soul 
 Healer of my scars 
 You steady my heart 
 You steady my heart 
 I'm not gonna worry 
 I know that you've got me 
 Right inside the palm 
 Of your hands 
 Each and every moment 
 What's good and what gets broken 
 Happens that the way you plan 
 But you're here, you're real 
 I know I can trust you 
 Even when it hurts 
 Even when it's hard 
 Even when it all just falls apart 
 And I will run to you 
 I'll find refuge in your arms 
 And I will sing to your 
 'Cause of everything you are 
 You steady my heart 
 You steady my heart 
 Even when it hurts 
 Even when it's hard 
 Even when it all just falls apart 
 I will run to you 
 'Cause I know that you are 
 Lover of my soul 
 Healer of my scars 
 You steady my heart 
 You steady my heart 
 I'm not gonna worry 
 I know that you've got me 
 Right inside the palm 
 Of your hands.

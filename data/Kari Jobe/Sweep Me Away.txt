Father, I love Your ways 
 You came in Your mercy and died in my place 
 All I can do is bow 
 Because of Your goodness and Your sovereign grace 
 That You sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love 
 Where nothing else matters 
 Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love 
 Where nothing else matters 
 Tears rolling down my face 
 Because of Your love and Your sweet embrace 
 The peace that just overflows 
 It's here that I know You have been waiting to 
 Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love 
 Where nothing else matters 
 Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love 
 Where nothing else matters 
 (Sweep me away, sweep me away) 
 Just You and me Lord 
 Sweep me away 
 (Sweep me away, away in Your love) 
 Sweep me away in Your love 
 (Sweep me away, sweep me away) 
 Sweep me away in Your love 
 (Sweep me away, away in Your love) 
 Sweep me away in Your love 
 Oh, away in Your love, sweep 
 Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love 
 Where nothing else matters 
 Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love 
 Where nothing else matters 
 Just You and me, just You and me 
 Sweep me away, oh Lord 
 Your grace, it covers me 
 Your love, it covers me 
 Oh God, You cover me 
 Your grace, it covers me 
 Your love, it covers me 
 Oh God, You cover me 
 Your grace, it covers me 
 Your love, it covers me 
 Oh God, You cover me 
 Your grace, it covers me 
 Your love, it covers me 
 Oh God, You cover me

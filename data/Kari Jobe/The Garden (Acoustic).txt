I had all but given up 
 Desperate for a sign from love 
 Something good, something kind 
 Bringing peace to every corner of my mind 
 Then I saw the garden 
 Hope had come to me 
 To sweep away the ashes 
 And wake me from my sleep 
 I realized You never left 
 And for this moment You planned ahead 
 That I would see 
 Your faithfulness in all of the green 
 I can see the ivy 
 Growing through the wall 
 Cause You will stop at nothing 
 To heal my broken soul 
 I can see the ivy 
 Reaching through the wall 
 Cause You will stop at nothing 
 To heal my broken soul 
 Oh, You heal broken souls 
 You're healing broken souls 
 Faith is rising up like ivy reaching for the light 
 Hope is stirring deep inside me 
 Making all things right 
 Love is lifting me from sorrow 
 Catching every tear 
 Dispelling every lie and torment 
 Crushing all my fears 
 You crush all my fears 
 You crush all my fears 
 With Your perfect love 
 Oh, with Your perfect love 
 Now I see redemption growing in the trees 
 The death and resurrection in every single seed

The more I seek you, 
 The more I find you 
 The more I find you, the more I love you 
 C:I wanna sit at your feet 
 Drink from the cup in your hand. 
 Lay back against you and breath, here your heart beat 
 This love is so deep, it's more than I can stand. 
 I melt in your peace, it's overwhelming

Every secret, every shame 
 Every fear, every pain 
 Live inside the dark 
 But that's not who we are 
 We are children of the day 
 So wake up sleeper, lift your head 
 We were meant for more than this 
 Fight the shadows conquer death 
 Make the most of the time we have left 
 We are the light of the world 
 We are the city on a hill 
 We are the light of the world 
 We gotta, we gotta, we gotta let the light shine 
 We are the light of the world 
 We are the city on a hill 
 We are the light of the world 
 We gotta, we gotta, we gotta let the light shine 
 Let the light shine, let the light shine 
 We are called to the spread the news 
 Tell the world the simple truth 
 Jesus came to save, there's freedom in His Name 
 So let His love break through 
 We are the light, We are the light, We are the light 
 So let your light shine brighter 
 We are the light, We are the light, We are the light 
 Jesus 
 You are the light, You are the light, You are the light 
 We will lift You higher 
 Shine, Shine, Shine 
 Let the light shine, let the light shine

You never change 
 You are the God you stay you are 
 When I'm afraid 
 You calm and still my beating heart 
 You stay the same, when hope is just a distant thought 
 You take my pain 
 And you lead me to the cross 
 What love is this, that You gave your life for me 
 And made a way for me to know You 
 And I confess You're always enough for me 
 You're all I need 
 I look to you 
 I see the scars upon Your hands 
 And hold the truth 
 That when I can't You always can 
 I'm standing here beneath the shadow of the cross 
 I'm overwhelmed that I keep finding open arms 
 What love is this that You gave your life for me 
 And made a way for me to know You 
 And I confess, You're always enough for me 
 You're all I need 
 Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me 
 Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me 
 What love is this, that You gave your life for me 
 And made a way for me to know You 
 And I confess, You're always enough for me 
 You're all I need 
 What love is this, that you gave your life for me 
 And made a way for me to know you 
 And I confess, you're always enough for me 
 Always enough for me 
 Always enough for me

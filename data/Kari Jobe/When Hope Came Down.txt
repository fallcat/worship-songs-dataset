So this is how it was 
 A silent night like any other, 
 When heaven sent the one, 
 The one we will call our savior, 
 And redemption begins, 
 In a stable in Bethlehem, 
 All of the angels lifted up their voices, 
 And filled the night with Hallelujah's, 
 God is with us now, 
 Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus, 
 Our savior King is here before us, 
 All to hear the sound 
 The song creation sang, 
 When Hope Came Down, 
 So This was truly God, 
 Wrapped in a tattered blanket, 
 Love was finally here, 
 Sleeping while the world awakened, 
 And redemption begins, 
 With a baby in Bethlehem, 
 All of the angels lifted up their voices, 
 And filled the night with Hallelujah's, 
 God is with us now, 
 Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus, 
 Our Savior King is here before us, 
 All to hear the sound 
 The song creation sang 
 When Hope Came Down, 
 So let us sing Redemption Song, 
 Let us worship Christ the Holy one, 
 We were lost, but we were found, 
 When Hope Came Down, 
 When Hope Came Down. 
 All of the angels lifted up their voices, 
 And filled the night with Hallelujah's, 
 God is with us now, 
 Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus, 
 Our Savior King is here before us, 
 All to hear the sound 
 The song creation sang 
 When Hope Came Down, 
 When Hope Came Down, 
 When Hope Came, 
 When Hope Came Down.

So faithful 
 So constant 
 So loving and so true 
 So powerful in all You do 
 You fill me 
 You see me 
 You know my every move 
 You love for me to sing to You 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You will never 
 Forsake me in my weakness 
 And I know that You have come down 
 Even if to ride upon my heart 
 To remind me who You are 
 So patient 
 So gracious 
 So merciful and true 
 So wonderful in all You do 
 You fill me 
 You see me 
 You know my every move 
 And You love for me to sing to You 
 And Lord, I know that You are for me 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You will never 
 Forsake me in my weakness 
 And I know that You have come down 
 Even if to ride upon my heart 
 To remind me 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You will never 
 Forsake me in my weakness 
 And I know that You have come down 
 Even if to ride upon my heart 
 To remind me who You are 
 You remind me 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You will never 
 Forsake me in my weakness 
 And I know that You have come down 
 Even if to ride upon my heart 
 To remind me who You are

I find it hard to turn away, a billion starving people, 
 But what can one do, I've heard you say - you can't save someone's life 
 I want to save a life today, I want to get someone close with my Father. 
 Be them the bread of life today, I want to help them get stronger, help them last longer 
 And give them a chance to see Jesus. 
 I find it hard to just ignore, the murdered unborn children, 
 Yes times have changed, but still God warns, you shall not take a life. 
 I want to save a life today, I want to keep one alive for my Father, 
 Who will avenge the blood! 
 Of weak and helpless ones someday - whose lives are spilled out like water, 
 Lambs in the slaughter, and each one is handmade by Jesus. 
 I find it hard to turn away, a billion starving people, a billion starving people.

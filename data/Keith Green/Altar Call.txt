Most people that knew me before 
 Didn't know that I could believe something so strong 
 The gospel is simpy this: 
 Jesus will forive all your sins 
 If you come to him humbly 
 Lay down at his feet and say: 
 'You're the lord 
 And I'll follow you the rest of my life on earth 
 So that I can have the rest of eternity with you 
 And the glory of your father' 
 Most people don't find out 
 Till it's too late 
 That someone has to pay the price 
 You can pay it your self (hah!) 
 Or let someone else 
 But who would be that nice 
 To pay a debt that isn't his 
 Well I know someone like that 
 And he's your best friend 
 He really is 
 He really loves you 
 Most people don't find out 
 Till they have death 
 That they need another life 
 You say you've heard everything 
 That's ever been said 
 About the way the truth, the life 
 You say you've heard lots of preaching 
 All before 
 So many times 
 But did you ever open up your door 
 Give him a chance 
 To prove himself 
 That he's real or not 
 I hope you find out 
 Before it's too late 
 That there's really nobody else 
 You know it's breaking his heart 
 The longer you wait 
 'Cause you've only been lying to yourself 
 Cause 
 No one believes a thing you say 
 Not even you 
 You know 
 You're gonna find out that he's the way 
 No matter which way you choose 
 But I pray you 
 Find out by his love for you 
 Some people won't find out 
 Till it's too late 
 Some people won't find out 
 Till it's too late

Do you see? 
 Do you see? 
 All the people sinking down? 
 Don't you care? 
 Don't you care? 
 Are you gonna let them drown? 
 How can you be so numb?! 
 Not to care if they come 
 You close your eyes, 
 And pretend the job is done 
 "Oh, bless me, Lord! 
 Bless me, Lord!" 
 You know, it's all I ever hear! 
 No one aches, 
 No one hurts, 
 No one even sheds one tear 
 But, He cries, 
 He weeps, 
 He bleeds, 
 And He cares for your needs 
 And you just lay back, 
 And keep soaking it in 
 Oh, can't you see such sin?! 
 'Cause He brings people to your door, 
 And you turn them away 
 As you smile and say: 
 "God bless you! 
 Be at peace!" 
 And all Heaven just weeps, 
 'Cause Jesus came to your door, 
 You left Him out on the streets 
 Open up! Open up! 
 And give yourself away 
 You see the need, 
 You hear the cries, 
 So how can you delay?! 
 God is calling, 
 And you are the one 
 But like Jonah, you run 
 He told you to speak, 
 But you keep holding it in 
 Oh, can't you see such sin?! 
 The world is sleeping in the dark, 
 That the church just can't fight, 
 'Cause it's asleep in the light! 
 How can you be so dead?! 
 When you've been so well fed 
 Jesus rose from the grave, 
 And you! 
 You can't even getta out of bed! 
 Oh, Jesus rose from the dead! 
 Common, get out of your bed! 
 How can you be so numb?! 
 Not to care if they come 
 You close your eyes, 
 And pretend the job is done! 
 You close your eyes, 
 And pretend the job is done! 
 Don't close your eyes, 
 Don't pretend the job is done 
 Come away! Come away! 
 Come away with Me, My love! 
 Come away from this mess, 
 Come away with Me, My love! 
 Come away from this mess! 
 Come away with Me, My love! 
 Come away, 
 Come away with Me My love!

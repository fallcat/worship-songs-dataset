People smile at me and ask me what it is 
 That makes them want to be just like I am 
 So I just point to you and tell them, yes it's true 
 I'm no special one, I'm just one man 
 It's because of you 
 People smile at me and say, what a lucky guy 
 It's because of you 
 I can raise my hands and reply 
 And say I'm happy because of you 
 Now people just can't believe, that my life used to be 
 Something that no one had any use for 
 I'd stay at home each night, never shine the light 
 And I thank you, it will never be like before 
 It's because of you 
 People point at me and say I like what that boys got 
 And because of you 
 I confess I don't have a lot 
 But what I have is because of you 
 Now people smile at me and ask me what it is 
 That makes them want to be just like I am 
 So I just point to you and tell them, yes it's true 
 I'm no special one, I'm just one man 
 It's because of you 
 People smile at me and they say, what a lucky guy 
 It's because of you 
 I can raise my hands to the sky 
 And say I'm only happy because of you

Cut the devil down, Lord, cut the devil down, 
 Drive him out of town, Lord, cut the devil down. 
 The devil hates Your blood, Lord, You know He hates Your blood, 
 So drown him in a flood, Lord, the devil hates Your blood. 
 Well, I thought that he'd be bound to leave 
 Without our praise and love, 
 But I know that he can't stand against me 
 When I'm seeking the power from above, Lord 
 Cut the devil down, Lord, cut the devil down, 
 Swing Your sword around, Lord, and cut the devil down. 
 The devil knows who's boss, he surely knows who's boss, 
 'Cause You beat him at the cross, Lord, the devil knows who's boss. 
 Well, the saints are crying to You Lord, 
 And they just can't be denied, 
 'Cause their clothes are washed in righteousness, 
 And their sins are all crucified. 
 Cut the devil down, Lord, shut the devil down, 
 Throw Your weight around, Lord, and cut the devil down. 
 The liar's got to leave, Lord, the liar's got to leave, 
 Because he saw You bleed, Lord, the liar's got to leave. 
 Well, my soul is crying to You, Lord, 
 And Your peace is all I need, 
 And I must repent before Your throne, 
 So I'm here on my knees, and I plead, 
 Oh cut the devil down, Lord, cut the devil down, 
 Blind him with Your crown, Lord, yeah, cut the devil down.

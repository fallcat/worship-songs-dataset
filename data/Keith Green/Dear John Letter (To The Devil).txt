Oh, I used to love you 
 But now that's hard to do 
 'Cause I got some information 
 'Bout them evil things at night that you do 
 And the whole thing is true 
 We're through 
 Oh you're such a devil 
 How'd you get me to believe you were true 
 Ooh! 
 Oh, my momma warned me 
 And how my daddy cried 
 The day I left my home 
 You said you'd always keep me satisfied 
 But oh, how you lied 
 You lied! 
 Well I should have heard my momma's words 
 But then I guess I had too much pride 
 Original sin! Whoa! 
 I used to lie awake at night 
 And see your face on the ceiling, oh 
 What a bad feeling I have 
 When I think of how you almost got me 
 In the ways of the world 
 In the ways of the world 
 My so-called friends say I misjudged you 
 My anger's all in vain 
 But I'm afraid you got to them 
 Before I had a chance to explain 
 And it caused me such pain 
 Ouch! 
 'Cause they were such good friends of mine 
 But now you've got them playing your game 
 You creep! Whoa! 
 I used to lie awake at night 
 And see your face on the ceiling 
 What a bad feeling I have 
 When I think of how you almost got me 
 In the ways of the world 
 In the ways of the world 
 Oh, in the ways of the world 
 In the ways of the world 
 Well, I believe in Jesus 
 And what he said he's gonna do 
 He'll put an apple in your lying mouth 
 And cook you in a sulfur stew 
 Woo, one that'll never be through 
 Is it soup yet? No! 
 Oh, but if he hadn't rescued me 
 Then I'd be down there cooking too 
 Oh, if Jesus hadn't rescued me 
 Then I'd be cooking right next to you, ooh 
 I used to lie awake at night 
 And see your face on the ceiling, haha 
 What a great feeling I have 
 When I think of how you're gonna get yours 
 At the end of the world 
 At the end of the world 
 Oh, at the end of the world 
 At the end of the world 
 Oh, at the end of the world

Look out your window, see the earth. 
 Where did it come from, who gave it birth. 
 Where did it come from, where will it go, where will it go? 
 Don't you wish you had the answers, well, I know. 
 See how the rain falls, who made the sky? 
 It's never ending, and you wonder why. 
 Where did it come from, where will it go, where will it go? 
 Don't you wish you had the answers, well I know. 
 Just look out past the stars, look to the one who put them there. 
 He, He made them all, and He gave them to us to share. 
 Yes He made them all, and He's gonna take them all back someday. 
 Don't you just wonder, what lies ahead? 
 There's peace in knowing, what Jesus said. 
 Where did you come from? Where will you go, where will you go? 
 Don't you wish you had the answers? 
 Don't you wish you had the answers? 
 Don't you wish you had the answers? 
 Well, I know.

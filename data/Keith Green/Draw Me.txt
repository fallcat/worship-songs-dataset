Draw me, oh, draw me, please draw me, my Jesus. 
 Into your presence, where I cannot lie. 
 My soul is so thirsty, I cannot endure it. 
 And if I can't get closer, I surely will die. 
 Take me, oh take me, please take me, my Jesus. 
 Quickly, before I forget that I'm lost. 
 For so many times, my mind has deceived me, 
 That I really don't have to carry the cross. 
 That I really don't have to carry the cross. 
 I just need to know how to pray. 
 My wicked desires block the way, 
 Sometimes I have grieved you away, 
 I don't want to do that today. 
 Help me, oh help me, please help me my Jesus. 
 Save me from sins that I thought were all gone. 
 Kill me with kindness, and break through my blindness. 
 I know till I'm dead, I can never live on. 
 I know till I'm dead, I can never live on. 
 I just need to know how to pray. 
 My wicked desires block the way, 
 Sometimes I have grieved you away, 
 I don't want to do that today. 
 Draw me, oh draw me, please draw me my Jesus.

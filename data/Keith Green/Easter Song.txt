Hear the bells ringing 
 They're singing that you can be born again 
 Hear the bells ringing 
 They're singing Christ is risen from the dead 
 The angel up on the tombstone 
 Said He has risen, just as He said 
 Quickly now, go tell his disciples 
 That Jesus Christ is no longer dead 
 Joy to the word, He has risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 Hear the bells ringing 
 They're singing that you can be healed right now 
 Hear the bells ringing, they're singing 
 Christ, He will reveal it now 
 The angels, they all surround us 
 And they are ministering Jesus' power 
 Quickly now, reach out and receive it 
 For this could be your glorious hour 
 Joy to the world, He has risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 The angel up on the tombstone 
 Said He has risen, just as He said 
 Quickly now, go tell his disciples 
 That Jesus Christ is no longer dead 
 Joy to the world, He has risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 He's risen, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah

Lord, the feelings are not the same, 
 I guess I'm older, I guess I've changed. 
 And how I wish it had been explained, that as you're growing you must remember, 
 That nothing lasts, except the grace of God, by which I stand, in Jesus. 
 I know that I would surely fall away, except for grace, by which I'm saved. 
 Lord, I remember that special way, 
 I vowed to serve you, when it was brand new. 
 But like Peter, I can't even watch and pray, one hour with you, 
 And I bet, I could deny you too. 
 But nothing lasts, except the grace of God, by which I stand, in Jesus. 
 I'm sure that my whole life would waste away, except for grace, by which I'm saved. 
 But nothing lasts, except the grace of God, by which I stand, in Jesus. 
 I know that I would surely fall away, except for grace, by which I'm saved.

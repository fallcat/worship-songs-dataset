You know, it ain't no use 
 Banging your head 
 Up against that cold stone wall 
 'Cause noboby's perfect 
 Except for the Lord-- 
 Even the best's bound to fall 
 Remember, 
 He is the vine 
 And you are the branch 
 He loves to get you through it if you give him a chance 
 You just keep doing your best 
 And pray that it's blessed 
 Jesus takes care of the rest 
 Yes the Lord said He'll take care of the rest 
 He's gonna do it! 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 He'll see you through it, yeah 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 The devil blew it! 
 (Old pharaoh blew it) 
 (His neighbors blew it) 
 Well He'll take care of the-- 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 You just think about Moses 
 In front of the burning bush 
 Barefoot on the holy ground 
 You know he must've been thinking 
 "Hey, what's an old dude like me 
 Gonna tell 'em of when I go down?" (Go down Moses) 
 But the Lord said 
 "Hey Mo, don't you worry about goin' down south 
 I'll be sayin' every word that comes out of your mouth 
 You just keep doing your best 
 And pray that it's blessed 
 And hey Mo, I'll take care of the rest" 
 Yes the Lord said He'll take care of the rest 
 He's gonna do it! 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 He'll see you through it, yeah 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 The devil blew it! 
 (Old pharaoh blew it) 
 (His neighbors blew it) 
 Well He'll take care of the-- 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 Just believe 
 And you'll receive 
 That comfort you need 
 You just think about all those lonely people you know 
 They've got everything they want 
 But they've got empty souls 
 But he'll take care of the-- 
 He'll take care of the-- 
 Care of the rest! 
 You just think about Noah 
 Shoulderin' his umbrella 
 When there wasn't a cloud in the sky 
 All his neighbors would laugh 
 At his pet giraffe 
 And they would oh-ho, snicker as he passed by 
 But the Lord said 
 "Be cool - you just keep building that boat 
 It's just a matter of time 
 'Til they see who's gonna float 
 You just keep doing your best 
 And pray that it's blessed 
 And hey Noah, Ill take care of the rest 
 I'm THE weather man 
 Yes the Lord said He'll take care of the rest 
 He's gonna do it! 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 He'll see you through it, yeah 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 The devil blew it! 
 (Old pharaoh blew it) 
 (His neighbors blew it) 
 Well He'll take care of the-- 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 He's gonna do it! 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 Oh, now Jesus will see you through it 
 He'll take care of the rest 
 Yes, yes, yes 
 He'll take care of the-- 
 He'll take care of the-- 
 He'll take care of the rest...

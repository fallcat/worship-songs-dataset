Oh Lord, there's just so much to be done 
 Oh Lord, so many souls to be won 
 Oh Lord, this world is falling apart 
 Dying for love from a broken heart 
 Here am I, send me 
 Though there's really not that much I can do 
 What I have seems so small 
 But I want to give it all to you 
 Oh Lord, you said the harvest was great 
 But Lord, looks like the workers are late 
 It's getting hard to understand 
 How they ignore your great command 
 Here am I, send me 
 Though you said the ones who labor are few 
 Still my heart hears the call 
 And I wanna give it all to you 
 Oh, to reach the ones nobody does 
 Give up my pride and even work in the mud 
 I wanna be like those who spilled their blood 
 And gave it like water to you 
 Oh Lord, there's just so much to be done 
 Oh Lord, so many souls to be won 
 It seem this world is falling apart 
 Lord won't you send me? 
 Oh Lord, there's just so much to be done 
 Oh Lord, so many souls to be won 
 Oh Lord, this world is falling apart 
 Crying for love from a broken heart 
 Here am I, send me 
 Though there's really not that much I can do 
 What I have seems so small 
 But I want to give it all to you 
 Here am I, send me 
 Though you said the ones you've chosen are few 
 Still my heart hears you call 
 And I wanna give it all to you

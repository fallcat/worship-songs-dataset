Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! 
 Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; 
 Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty 
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity! 
 Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee 
 Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see; 
 Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee 
 Perfect in power, love, and purity 
 Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! 
 All Thy works shall praise Thy name, 
 In earth, and sky, and sea; 
 Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty 
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity! 
 God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

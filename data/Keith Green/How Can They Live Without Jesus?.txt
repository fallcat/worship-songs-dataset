How can they live without Jesus? 
 How can they live without God's love? 
 How can they feel so at home down here? 
 When there's so much more up above? 
 Throwing away the things that matter, 
 They hold onto things that don't 
 The world has gone crazy, but soon maybe 
 A lot more are gonna know 
 For maybe they don't understand it 
 Or maybe they just haven't heard 
 Or maybe we're not doing all we can 
 Living up to his holy word 
 'Cause follies have come and wrong's been done 
 Even killing in Jesus' name 
 And if you've been burned here's what I've learned 
 The Lord's not the one to blame 
 For he's just not religion 
 With steeples and bells 
 Or a salesman who will sell you 
 The things you just want to hear 
 For his love was such 
 That he suffered so much 
 To cause some of us 
 Just to follow, follow 
 So many laughing at Jesus 
 While the funniest thing that he's done 
 Is love this whole stubborn, rebellious world 
 While their hate for him just goes on 
 And love just like that will bring him back 
 For the few he can call his friends 
 The ones he's found true who've made it through 
 Enduring until the end 
 The ones he's found true who've made it through 
 Enduring until the end

There is nothing new 
 I could give to you 
 Just a life that's torn 
 Waiting to be born 
 Rivers overflow 
 Friends may come and go 
 But you've been by my side 
 With every tear I've cried 
 Oh, I can't believe that You'd give everything for me 
 I can't believe it no, I can't believe it no, no 
 I know You never lied and so it's just my foolish pride 
 That I just won't receive it yeah 
 It's so hard to receive it in my heart and make the start with you 
 Help me, help me now 
 I just don't know how 
 You know, I've been so alone 
 Please melt this heart of stone 
 Lah, lah, lah, lah 
 Oh, I can't believe that You'd give everything for me 
 I can't believe it no, I can't believe it no, no 
 I know You never lied and so I'm giving up my pride 
 So I can receive it yeah 
 I just want to receive it in my heart and make the start with you 
 Lah, lah, lah

After all the things that you have shown me 
 I'd be a fool to let them slip away 
 In doing things I know I shouldn't do 
 But I don't want to fall away from you 
 From you 
 After all 
 I've only grieved Your spirit 
 And then I don't know why You stay with me 
 But every time I fall Your love comes through 
 And I don't want to fall away from You 
 When the light is gone 
 And good times are getting old 
 There's no one left to count on 
 And all my friends are cold 
 When I thirst for love oh Lord 
 You're a fountain to my soul 
 My soul 
 My soul 
 Oh Lord 
 My soul 
 In a way my life is full of burdens 
 But in a way You carry them from me 
 Jesus 
 Cause no one understands the way You do 
 And you know Lord 
 I don't want to fall away from You 
 Well every day I pray to start anew 
 'Cause I don't want to fall away from You 
 No Lord 
 I don't wanna fall away from You 
 No Lord 
 I don't wanna fall away from You 
 From You... Lord

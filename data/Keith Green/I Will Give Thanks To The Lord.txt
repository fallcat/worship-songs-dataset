I will give thanks to the lord 
 With all my heart 
 I wil tell of all thy wonders 
 I will be glad and exult in thee 
 I will trust in you my god 
 Who delivered me 
 And lifted me from the gates of death 
 I will be glad and exult in thee 
 I will give thanks to the lord 
 With all my heart 
 I will tell of all thy wonders 
 I will be glad and exult in thee 
 I will tell of all thy wonders 
 I will be glad and exult in thee

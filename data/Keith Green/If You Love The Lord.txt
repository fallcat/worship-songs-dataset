 Instead of questions why, there'll be praise for all he brings you through. 
 And if you love the Lord, you will love His Holy Commands. 
 Delight yourself in them, and everything you do will surely stand. 
 We are His workmanship, created for good works in Christ. 
 He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice. 
 Well if you love the Lord, his discipline you won't despise. 
 Cause it will prove to you, that you're a child in His eyes.

 And even when you're old, from His Holy place you won't depart. 
 We are His workmanship, created for good works in Christ.

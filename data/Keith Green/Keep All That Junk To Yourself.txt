Feeling good 'bout the way I am 
 How come you just can't let me be 
 Oh, I've got no use for your master plans 
 No one's running this life but me 
 Oh, 'cause I, I've got to stand on my own 
 No, I can't lean on nobody else 
 'Cause I, I've learned a long time ago 
 I've got to keep lookin' out for myself 
 And you can keep all that junk to yourself 
 You keep warning me 'bout the way I'm goin' 
 But my future's lookin' just fine 
 And I've got no use for your scary tales 
 I'm sure I've got long 'til I die 
 'Cause my time, you know, it's more important to me 
 Then to talk about angels and hell 
 'Cause I, I've read the Bible before 
 And it keep it right there on a shelf 
 And you can keep all that junk to yourself 
 Yeah, you can keep all that junk to yourself 
 Give it all, yeah 
 Yes, I'm feeling real good 'bout my life right now 
 And I'm sure for you it's all true 
 If it makes you happy, enjoy yourself 
 I'm so glad it's working for you 
 But for me, you know, I've got to stand on my own 
 No, I can't lean on nobody else 
 'Cause I, I've learned a long time ago 
 Got to keep lookin' out for myself 
 And you can keep all that jive to yourself 
 Yeah, you can keep all that junk to yourself 
 Yeah, you can keep all that junk to yourself 
 Give it all now 
 Give it all now 
 (Give it all now) 
 (Give it all now) 
 (Give it all now)

When I was young I used to believe everything that I heard, just what I heard. 
 But now the only thing that I can believe is God's word, His Holy Word. 
 But even now my doubts will open up for me a world that I just despise. 
 And then the shades come down, the light turn off, 
 And I'm left alone with my helpless cries. 
 When I hear all his lies. All of the devil's wicked lies. 
 If you believe and your faith just dies. 
 Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up, 
 Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies. 
 I want to go around the world and prove Jesus lives, You know He lives. 
 And we're not only friends, we're family, we're relatives, relatives. 
 But when I'm far from home and so alone, and my imagined fears get so oversized. 
 That's when I listen to the one no one should listen to, and get fooled by his disguise. 
 Feeling weak from his lies, all of his bad wicked lies, 
 If you believe and your faith just dies. 
 Don't you get fooled, don't you even open up, 
 Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies. 
 If you're well read, you probably know how the story goes. 
 That wolf can look so good especially dressed in the right clothes, the wooly clothes. 
 And as he starts to knit the counterfeit he'll totally make you feel like you're paralyzed. 
 He'll keep you spun around and looking down, 
 Just when you should be looking straight to the skies. 
 Pleading help from his lies, all of the devil's wicked lies. 
 If you believe and your faith just dies. 
 Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up, or expose yourself, 
 To one of his wicked lies, to one of his wicked lies.

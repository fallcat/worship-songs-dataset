You want to love with me, love with me then 
 I only ask that you still be my friend 
 For there are many where friendship's unknown 
 They live together but really alone 
 And the days go their ways in silence 
 Tense hours of woe 
 We do not mean to have it so 
 I know that sometimes I'm harder to love 
 I thrash out blindly, like nothing's thought of 
 So won't you help me to help you be sure? 
 God only knows that I want to be pure 
 But the world keeps it promise daily to let me down 
 But it can't hide what I have found 
 So I will love you, and love you I do 
 It's not complete yet, but you know we're not through 
 And the days go their ways in blessings, moments of truth 
 We truly dare not waste our youth 
 We truly dare not waste our youth 
 You wanna love with me, love with me then

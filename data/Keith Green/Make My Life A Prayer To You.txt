Make my life a prayer to you 
 I wanna do what you want me to 
 No empty words and no white lies 
 No token prayers no compromise 
 I wanna shine the light you gave 
 Through your son you sent to save us 
 From ourselves and our despair 
 It comforts me to know you're really there 
 Well I wanna thank you know 
 For being patient with me 
 Oh it's so hard to see 
 When my eyes are on me 
 I guess I'll have to trust 
 And just believe what you say 
 Oh you're coming again 
 Coming to take me away 
 I wanna die and let you give 
 Your life to me so I might live 
 And share the hope you gave me 
 The love that set me free 
 I wanna tell the world out there 
 You're not some fable or fairy tale 
 That I've made up inside my head 
 You're God the son and you've risen from the dead 
 I wanna die and let you give 
 Your life to me so I might live 
 And share the hope you gave me 
 The love that set me free

My eyes are dry 
 My faith is old 
 My heart is hard 
 My prayers are cold 
 And I know how I ought to be 
 Alive to You and dead to me 
 But what can be done 
 For an old heart like mine 
 Soften it up 
 With oil and wine 
 The oil is You, Your Spirit of love 
 Please wash me anew 
 With the wine of Your Blood 
 (Repeat)

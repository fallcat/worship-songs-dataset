Oh, my job keeps getting easier 
 As time keeps slippin' away 
 I can imitate the brightest light 
 And make the night look just like day 
 I put some truth in every lie 
 To tickle itchin' ears 
 You know, I'm drawing people just like flies 
 'Cause they like what they hear 
 I'm gaining power by the hour 
 They're falling by the score 
 You know it's getting very simple now 
 'Cause no one believes in me anymore! 
 Oh, heaven's just a state of mind 
 My books read on your shelf 
 Oh, have you heard that God is dead? 
 I made that one up myself 
 They're dabbling with magic spells 
 They get their fortunes read 
 You know, they heard the truth 
 But turned away 
 And then followed me instead 
 I used to have to sneak around 
 But now they just open their doors 
 You know, no one's watching for my trick 
 Since no one believes in me anymore! 
 Everyone likes a winner 
 With my help, your're guaranteed to win 
 Hey man, you ain't no sinner! 
 No, you've got the truth within 
 And as your life slips by you believe the lie 
 That you did it on your own 
 But don't worry 
 I'll be there to help you share 
 A dark eternal home 
 A dark eternal home! 
 Oh, my job keeps getting easier 
 As day slips into day 
 The magazines, the newspapers 
 Print every word I say 
 This world is just my spinning top 
 It's all like child's play 
 You know, I dream that it would never stop 
 But I know it's not that way 
 Still my work goes on and on 
 Always stronger than before 
 I'm gonna make it dark before the dawn 
 Since no one believes in me anymore! 
 Well, I used to have to sneak around 
 But now they just open their doors 
 You know, no one is watching for my tricks 
 Since no one believes in me anymore! 
 Well, I'm gaining power by the hour, 
 They're falling by the score, 
 You know, it's getting very easy now 
 Since no one believes in me anymore! 
 No one believes in me anymore! 
 No one BELIEVES in me anymore!

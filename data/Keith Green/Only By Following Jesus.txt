Hallelujah, God's been talking to ya, 
 You can be what you're meant to be, 
 But only by following Jesus. 
 The kingdom come now, 
 The devil is on the run now, 
 And you can live for eternity, 
 But only by following Jesus. 
 Know where you're heading, 
 'Cause it gets so upsetting, 
 When your friends let you down, 
 And there ain't no love around. 
 Look straight ahead now, 
 And learn what Jesus said, 
 He would never forsake you. 
 The time is short now. 
 You've got to give Him a good report now. 
 And start living accordingly. 
 It's getting hard now, 
 You gotta start in your own backyard now. 
 But it will be coming more easily. 
 But only by following Jesus. 
 Know where you're heading, 
 Cause there'll be no regretting. 
 When you walk in that place, 
 And see the glory on His face. 
 Look straight ahead now, 
 Remember what Jesus said, 
 How He would come back for you. 
 The world is dying, 
 And you've been getting so tired of trying, 
 But you'll be finding a remedy, 
 Only by following Jesus. 
 The time is coming, 
 When those on Earth will be hiding and running, 
 From the Lamb of Eternity, 
 'Cause they weren't following Jesus. 
 No, No, they weren't following Jesus. 
 No, No, they weren't following, they weren't following, 
 They weren't following Jesus. 
 Hallelujah, the Lord of Heaven's been talking to ya. 
 Hallelujah, the Lord of Heaven's been talking to ya.

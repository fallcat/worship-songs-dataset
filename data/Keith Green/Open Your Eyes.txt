spoken: 
 This generation of believers that you and me are a part of, we are responsible for this generation of souls, all over the world. We're responsible for them. We're responsible to pray daily for the needs of ministries around the world, and ask God "how about me not sending my money this time, how about me going?" It's so easy to write checks, it's so easy. But God can't cash out of state checks in Heaven. He needs you! 
 Open your eyes to the world all around you, open your eyes, open your eyes 
 This world is much more than the things that surround you 
 You must arise, and open your eyes 
 Sometimes we're too busy to share, but Jesus wants to care, to care 
 Open your arms to the naked and shivering, open your arms, open your arms 
 We need a little less taking, a whole lot more giving 
 We're so safe and warm, we can open our arms 
 And love a little bit stronger, and pray a little bit longer, longer 
 Jesus says, when we love someone in His name, we're loving Him 
 Jesus says, when we touch someone in His name, we're touching Him 
 And we've got to show them the light, we've got to pour out our lives 
 Open your hearts to the ones who are desperate, open your hearts, open your hearts 
 They may never repay you, but their souls are worth it 
 The life you impart when you open your heart 
 Jesus loves all men the same 
 So we've got to go out in His name 
 Jesus says, when we touch someone in His name, we're touching Him 
 Jesus says, when we love someone in His name, we're loving Him 
 Jesus says, when we feed someone in His name, we're feeding Him 
 And Jesus says, when we reach someone in His name 
 He feels, He says, it's all for Him 
 It's all for Him 
 Open your eyes to the world all around you, open your eyes, open your eyes 
 This world is much more than the things that surround you 
 Jesus loves all men the same, so we've got to go out in His name 
 Jesus says, Jesus says, Jesus says, it's Him 
 Jesus says, when we love someone in His name, we're loving Him

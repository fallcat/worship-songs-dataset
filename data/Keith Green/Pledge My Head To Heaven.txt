Will I pledge my head to heaven for the Gospel, 
 And I ask no man on Earth to fill my needs. 
 Like the sparrow up above, I am enveloped in His love, 
 And I trust Him like those little ones, He feeds. 
 Well I pledge my wife to heaven, for the Gospel, 
 Though our love each passing day just seems to grow. 
 As I told her when we wed, I'd surely rather be found dead, 
 Than to love her more than the one who saved my soul. 
 I'm your child, and I want to be in your family forever. 
 I'm your child, and I'm going to follow you, 
 No matter whatever the cost, I'm gonna count all things lost. 
 Well I pledge my son to heaven for the gospel. 
 Though he's kicked and beaten, ridiculed and scorn. 
 I will teach him to rejoice, and life a thankful praising voice, 
 And to be like Him who bore the nails and crown of thorns. 
 I'm your child, and I want to be in your family forever. 
 I'm your child, and I'm going to follow you, 
 No matter whatever the cost, I'm gonna count all things lost. 
 Oh no matter whatever the cost, I'm gonna count all things lost. 
 Well I've had the chance to gain the world, and to live just like a king, 
 But without your love, it doesn't mean a thing. 
 Oh no matter whatever the cost, I'm gonna count all things lost, 
 Oh no matter whatever the cost, I'm gonna count all things lost. 
 Well I pledge my son, I pledge my wife, I pledge my head to heaven, 
 I pledge my son, I pledge my wife, I pledge my head to heaven, for the gospel.

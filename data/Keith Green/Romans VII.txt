There are things I hate, I end up doing 
 Things I wanna do, just don't do 
 Lord, it seems so sad, 
 Why am I so bad? 
 When in my heart 
 I only wanna be like You 
 There are ones I love, I end up hurting 
 Ones I wanna help, I passed right by 
 Now I wanna be finally set free 
 The grace You've shown 
 The love I've known 
 Let it shine through me 
 I wanna love them, the way You do 
 I wanna serve them, by serving You 
 Lord, how I know, Your tender heart must be broken 
 By all those unkept promises I made 
 The question still prevails 
 Please take away the vail 
 About how You forgive 
 And still You live inside me when I fail 
 I wanna be like You 
 Jesus, I do

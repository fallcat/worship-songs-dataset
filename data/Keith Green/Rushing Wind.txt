Rushing wind, blow through this temple, 
 Blowing out the dust within; 
 Come and breathe your breath upon me: 
 I've been born again. 
 Holy Spirit, I surrender; take me where you want to go. 
 Plant me by your living water, 
 Plant me deep so I can grow. 
 Jesus, you're the one who sets my spirit free; 
 Use me, Lord; glorify your Holy Name through me. 
 Separate me from this world, Lord; 
 Sanctify my life for you. 
 Daily change me to your image, 
 Help me bear good fruit. 
 Ev'ry day you're drawing closer; 
 Trials come to test my faith. 
 But when all is said and done, Lord, 
 You know it's been worth the wait. 
 Jesus, you're the one who set my spirit free; 
 Use me, Lord; glorify your Holy Name through me. 
 Rushing wind, blow through this temple, 
 Blowing out the dust within; 
 Come and breathe you breath upon me, 
 For I've been born again.

So you wanna go back to Egypt 
 Where it's warm and secure 
 Are sorry you bought the one way ticket 
 When you thought you were sure 
 You wanted to live in the land of promise 
 But now it's getting so hard 
 Are you sorry you're out here in the desert 
 Instead of your own back yard 
 Eating leaks and onions by the Nile 
 Ooh what breath for dining out in style 
 Ooh, my life's on the skids 
 Building the pyramids 
 Well there's nothing do but travel 
 And we sure travel a lot 
 'Cause it's hard to keep your feet from moving 
 When the sand gets so hot 
 And in the morning it's manna hotcakes 
 We snack on manna all day 
 And we sure had a winner last night for dinner 
 Flaming manna souffle 
 Well we once complained for something new to munch 
 The ground opened up and had some of us for lunch 
 Ooh, such fire and smoke 
 Can't God even take a joke? Huh? NO! 
 So you wanna to back to Egypt 
 Where your friends wait for you 
 You can throw a big party and tell the whole gang 
 Of what they said was all true 
 And this Moses acts like a big shot 
 Who does he think he is? 
 Well it's true that God works lots of miracles 
 But Moses thinks they're all his 
 Oh we're having so much trouble even now 
 Why'd he get so mad about that c-c-c-cow (that golded calf) 
 Moses seems rather idle 
 He just sits aound, he just sits around and writes the Bible! 
 Oh, Moses, put down your pen! 
 What? Oh no, manna again? 
 Oh, manna waffles... 
 Manna burgers 
 Manna bagels 
 Fillet of manna 
 Manna patty 
 BaManna bread!

So many times I've tried to tell you 
 But I don't think you've been listening 
 There's nothing I wanna try and sell you 
 'Cause His love is free 
 You're so proud of saying you're a seeker 
 But why are you searching in the dark 
 You won't find a thing 
 Until you soften your heart 
 The message is oh so very simple 
 You gotta be like a child to see 
 'Cause Jesus said "Let the little children 
 Come unto Me" 
 You try to make things to complicated 
 But you really don't have to be so smart 
 You don't learn a thing 
 Until you soften your heart 
 Well if this just this once 
 I could show you your empty life 
 I know you would follow him 
 Right now 
 Well I know it sounds 
 Just too good to be true 
 But if He Lives in you 
 You'll never die, You'll never die, 
 You'll live forever 
 You'll never die, You'll never die, 
 Take care of forever now 
 You tell everyone to keep on smiling 
 YOur outlook on life is so positive 
 But deep down inside 
 You're searching for a reason to live 
 Like everyone else you're scared of dying 
 But the power of death has been blown apart 
 And you'll live forever 
 If you soften your heart

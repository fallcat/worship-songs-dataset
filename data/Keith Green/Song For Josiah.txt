Oh my son, you were born in a world that hates you, 
 And I swear I will never forsake you. 
 But there was a father centuries ago, 
 Who watched his beloved son die. Oh, die. 
 Oh my son, I am weak and I'm trembling, 
 For the Lord I am always remembering. 
 Oh what a strong shepherd holds you in His arms. 
 He'll break you and make you His own. 
 And then take you home. 
 Well if I could I would protect you from what you will see. 
 This world will promise love and beauty, but it lied to me. 
 And I will show you, if you will listen. 
 And I will promise, to listen too. 
 Oh yes, there are some who love the lies, they will kill you if they can. 
 Though you speak the truth in love, they will hate you like the man, 
 Jesus, although he was God, he allowed himself broken for you. 
 Well if I could I would protect you from what you will see. 
 The world might seem so alive, but it's dead to me. 
 And I will teach you, if you will hear me. 
 And I will promise, to hear you too. Yes I do. 
 Oh my son, I am only your brother. 
 For a sister, God gave me your mother. 
 But just like a mother, so long ago, had to watch her beloved son die, 
 Oh son, we will try, to let you go.

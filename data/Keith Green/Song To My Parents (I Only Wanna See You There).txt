I need to say these things 'cause 
 I love you so 
 And I'm sorry you get angry when I say that 
 You just don't know 
 That there's a heaven waiting 
 For you and me 
 I know it seems every time we talk 
 I'm only tryin' to just make you see 
 And it's only that I care 
 I really only want 
 Just to see you there. 
 Please try and overlook my, 
 My human side 
 I know I'm such a bad example 
 And you know I'm so full of pride 
 But Jesus isn't like that- 
 No He's perfect all the way, 
 I guess that's why we need Him 
 'Cause by ourselves (ha) 
 There's just no way 
 And it's only that I care 
 I really only want 
 Just to see you there. 
 Close the doors 
 They're just not comin' 
 We sent the invitations out long, long, long, long time ago! 
 We're still gonna have a wedding feast 
 Big enough to beat them all 
 The greatest people in the world just wouldn't come 
 So now we'll just have to invite the small 
 And it's only that I care 
 I really only want 
 Just to see you there. 
 Isn't that Jesus? 
 Isn't that Joseph and Mary's son? 
 Well, did He grow up right here? 
 He played with our children. 
 What! He must be kidding, 
 Thinks He's a prophet, 
 Well, prophets don't grow up from little boys, 
 Do they? From little boys? 
 Do they?

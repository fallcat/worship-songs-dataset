We are like windows 
 Stained with colors of the rainbow 
 Set in a darkened room 
 Till the bridegroom comes to shining through 
 Then the colors fall around our feet 
 Over those we meet 
 Covering all the gray that we see 
 Rainbow colors of assorted hues 
 Come exchange your blues 
 For His love that you see shining through me 
 We are His daughters and sons 
 We are the colorful ones 
 We are the kids of the King 
 Rejoice in everything 
 My colors grow so dim 
 When I start to fall away from Him 
 But up comes the strongest wind 
 That He sends to blow me back into his arms again 
 And then the colors fall around my feet 
 Over those I meet 
 Changing all the gray that I see 
 Rainbow colors of the Risen Son 
 Reflect the One 
 The One who came to set us all free 
 We are His daughters and sons 
 We are the colorful ones 
 We are the kids of the King 
 Rejoice in everything 
 We are like windows 
 Stained with colors of the rainbow 
 No longer set in a darkened room 
 Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you 
 No longer set in a darkened room 
 Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you

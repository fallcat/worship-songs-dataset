Unexpectedly, you came back to see, 
 If I'd was waiting, like I promised long before. 
 Your shadow filled the room, the music changed it's tune, 
 When I saw you, you were standing at the door. 
 Like summer snow, You were an unexpected sight. 
 A blazing sun, you were shining in the night, 
 When I really should have known, that you'd be coming home. 
 I waited patiently, but I found it hard to see, 
 If you were coming, why was there such a long delay. 
 At times I thought you lied, or else you would have tried, 
 To let me know that you were coming home today. 
 Like summer snow, it falls around me in the cold. 
 I can hear the echoes, of the warnings I was told. 
 That I should know, that you'd be coming home. 
 Like summer snow, You were an unexpected sight. 
 A blazing sun, you were shining in the night, 
 When I really should have known, that you'd be coming home. 
 Unexpectedly, you came back to see...

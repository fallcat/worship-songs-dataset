Thank You Jesus, for what you're doing for me, 
 Thank you Jesus, I want the whole world to see, 
 That you're not just a picture on the wall in my room, 
 That you're faster than lightning, and you're coming back soon. 
 Thank you Jesus, for all the good things you do, 
 Thank you Jesus, I wish they all could know you, 
 That you're not just a book collecting dust on the shelf, 
 And if they don't want to read it, you're gonna be back to tell them yourself. 
 I don't understand, why my fellow man, had to turn away, 
 From all the good things that you say, 
 They're still trying to find a better way, but you know they won't, 
 Unless they invent one, then we'll have to patent it. 
 Thank you Jesus, for all the good things you've done, 
 Thank you Jesus, I really want to tell you Lord, 
 I'm having so much fun, loving You. 
 Thank you Jesus, for this here smile on my face, 
 I really want to shout it to the whole Human Race, 
 That you're not just this building on the corner where we meet, 
 They can know You in person, You're a pleasure to meet. 
 Thank you Jesus, Oh thank you Jesus, 
 Thank you Jesus, I only want to thank you Jesus, 
 I don't care what they say, 
 They're gonna call you a clich√©, 
 I'm gonna love you anyway!

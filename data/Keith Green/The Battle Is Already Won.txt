Well, the battle is already won, 
 And the race has already been run, 
 It's been done, you just have to claim the victory. 
 And the future is already made, 
 The foundation was totally laid, 
 When he paid the bloody price for you and me. 
 Oh my friend, have you heard the story, 
 What my Jesus has done? 
 We will share His triumphant glory, 
 For the battle is already won. 
 When the sign of the end shall appear, 
 Fill the sky with a message so clear, 
 All will hear the beloved calling of our Lord. 
 Every tongue will confess to His Name, 
 All his children and angels proclaim, 
 He's the same for now, for now, for now and every more, 
 He don't change. 
 Oh my friend won't you join the chorus, 
 Singing praise to the son. 
 From the day that he laid his life down for us, 
 The battle was already won. 
 Raise your banners high, 
 Praises fill the sky, 
 Mountains tremble and fall, 
 Hallelujah sing, glory to the King, 
 Lord creator of all. 
 Well, the battle is already won, 
 And the race has already be run, 
 It's all been done, you just gotta claim the victory. 
 And the future is already made, 
 The foundation was totally laid, 
 When he paid the ugly, bloody price for you and me. 
 Oh my friend, have you heard the story, 
 What my Jesus has done, 
 We'll return in triumphant glory, 
 For the battle, it's already won.

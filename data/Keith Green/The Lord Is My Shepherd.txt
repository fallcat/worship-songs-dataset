The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want 
 He makes me lie down in green pastures. 
 He leads me beside the still waters. 
 He restore'th my soul 
 And guides my path in righteousness 
 For His name's sake. 
 Surely goodness and loving kindness 
 Shall follow me all the days of my life. 
 And I will dwell in the house of the Lord 
 Forever and ever and ever. 
 Though I walk through the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 I will not fear, Thou art with me. 
 Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. 
 Thou prepar'est a table 
 Before me in the presence of my enemies. 
 Thou anoint'est my head with oil 
 My cup's overflowing 
 Surely goodness and loving kindness 
 Shall follow me al the days of my life. 
 And I will dwell in the house of the Lord 
 Forever and ever and ever.

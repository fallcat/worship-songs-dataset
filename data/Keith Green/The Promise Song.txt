Oh if you keep My word, 
 I'll make you as a tree, 
 Planted by the streams of life, 
 If you'll submit to me. 
 And if you love the hateful ones, 
 Who mistreat you constantly, 
 The book of life shall bear your name, 
 If you love your enemies. 
 Yes, Lord Jesus. 
 Yes, Lord Jesus. 
 And if you do my will, 
 I'll make you living stones, 
 To build up in My Father's house, 
 If you serve Me alone. 
 And if you love all men, 
 Especially the least, 
 I'll raise you up, the lowest ones, 
 And make you kings and priests. 
 Yes, Lord Jesus. 
 Yes, Lord Jesus. 
 And if you'll seek my face, 
 And set your life apart, 
 I'll let myself be found by you, 
 When you search with all your heart. 
 And if you never turn aside, 
 To the left or to the right, 
 I'll be a lamp unto your feet, 
 And keep you on the path of light. 
 Yes Lord Jesus, 
 Yes Lord Jesus 
 Yes Lord Jesus, 
 Yes Lord Jesus

Swallowed into earth's dark womb 
 And death has triumphed 
 That's what they say 
 But tried to hold Him in the tomb 
 The Son of Life 
 Rose on the third day 
 Just look 
 The gates of hell 
 They're falling 
 Crumbling from the inside out 
 He's bursting through 
 The walls with laughter (Hah!) 
 Listen to the Angels shout 
 It is finished 
 He has done it 
 Life conquered death 
 Jesus Christ 
 Has won it 
 His plan of battle 
 You know it 
 He fooled them all 
 They led Him off to prison to die 
 But as He entered Hades Hall 
 He broke those hellish chains with a cry 
 Just listen to those demons screaming 
 See Him bruise the serpent's head 
 The prisoners of Hell 
 He's redeeming (Oh!) 
 All the power of death is dead 
 It is finished 
 He has done it 
 Life conquered death 
 Jesus Christ 
 Has won it 
 Just look 
 The gates of hell they're falling 
 Crumbling from the inside out 
 He's bursting through the walls with laughter (Hah!) 
 Listen to the Angels shout 
 (Listen, oh, listen) 
 It is finished 
 He has done it 
 Life conquered death 
 Jesus Christ 
 Has won it 
 It is finished 
 He has done it 
 Life conquered death 
 Jesus Christ 
 Has won it

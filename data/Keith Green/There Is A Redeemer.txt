There is a Redeemer 
 Jesus, God's own Son 
 Precious Lamb of God 
 Messiah, Holy One 
 Jesus, my Redeemer 
 Name above all names 
 Precious Lamb of God 
 Messiah, O for sinners slain 
 Thank You, O my Father 
 For giving us Your Son 
 And leaving us Your Spirit 
 'Til the work on earth is done 
 When I stand in glory 
 I will see His face 
 And there I'll serve 
 My King forever 
 In that holy place

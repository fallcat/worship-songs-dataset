To obey is better than sacrifice 
 I don't need your money 
 I want your life 
 And I hear you say that I'm coming back soon 
 But you act like I'll never return 
 Well you speak of grace and my love so sweet 
 How you thrive on milk, but reject My meat 
 And I can't help weeping of how it will be 
 If you keep on ignoring My words 
 Well you pray to prosper and succeed 
 But your flesh is something I just can't feed 
 To obey is better than sacrifice 
 I want more than Sunday and Wednesday nights 
 'Cause if you can't come to Me every day 
 Then don't bother coming at all 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 To obey is better than sacrifice 
 I want hearts of fire 
 Not your prayers of ice 
 And I'm coming quickly 
 To give back to you 
 According to what you have done

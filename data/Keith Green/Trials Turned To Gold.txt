He's brought me here, where things are clear 
 And trials turn to gold 
 He shared with me, His victory 
 He won in days of old 
 Oh Lord, I don't deserve 
 The riches of your word 
 But You've changed my filthy rags 
 To linen white as snow 
 The view from here is nothing near 
 To what it is for You 
 I tried to see Your plan for me 
 But I only acted like I knew 
 Oh Lord forgive the times 
 I tried to read your mind 
 Cause you said if I'd be still 
 Then I would hear your voice 
 My Lord, my King, my urge to sing 
 And praise the things above 
 No words can say the glorious way 
 You changed me with your love 
 He's brought me low, so I could know 
 The way to reach the heights 
 To forsake my dreams, my self esteem 
 And give up all my rights 
 With each one that I lay down 
 A jewel's placed in my crown 
 Cause His love, the things above 
 Is all we'll ever need 
 He's brought me here, where things are clear 
 And trials turn to gold

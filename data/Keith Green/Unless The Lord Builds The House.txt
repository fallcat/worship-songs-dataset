Unless the Lord builds the house, 
 They labor in vain to try at all, 
 Building anything not according to His call. 
 Unless the Lord wants it done, 
 You better not work another day, 
 Building anything that will stand in His way. 
 You love the Lord and it seems like He's been leading, 
 You've asked Him to bless all your plans. 
 But are you so sure you're NOT just doing what you want to, 
 Building your house on the sand, the sand. 
 Unless the Lord builds the house, 
 They labor in vain to try at all, 
 Building anything not according to His call. 
 Unless the Lord wants it done, 
 You better not work another day, 
 Building anything that will stand in His way. 
 Working so hard at the things that you believe in, 
 No one can tear you away. 
 But don't you lose sight of the very one who calls you, 
 You may be sorry some day, some day. 
 For wood, hay and stubble, will all burn up in the fire. 
 But to love the Lord with all your heart, should be your one desire. 
 Love the Lord. 
 Unless the Lord wants it done, 
 You better not work another day, 
 Building anything that will stand, 
 Anything that will stand, anything that will stand.

My flesh is tired of seeking God, 
 But on my knees I'll stay. 
 I want to be a pleasing child, 
 Until that final day. 
 My mind is full of many thoughts 
 That clutter and confuse. 
 But standing firm, I will prevail, 
 In faith that I'll be used. 
 Amen! I'm asking once again. 
 Won't you help me my friend, Lord Jesus. 
 Holy Lord Spirit, set us free, 
 From chains we cannot see, 
 Come release us. 
 I wrestle not with flesh and blood, 
 My fight is with the one, 
 Who lost the keys of hell and death, 
 To God's most precious son. 
 One sleepless night of anguished prayer, 
 I triumphed over sin. 
 One battle in the Holy war, 
 God's promised me to win. 
 Amen! I'm asking once again. 
 Won't you help me my friend, Lord Jesus. 
 Holy, Lord Spirit, set us free, 
 From chains we cannot see, 
 Come release us. 
 My flesh is tired of seeking God, 
 But on my knees I'll stay. 
 I want to be a pleasing child, 
 Until that final day.

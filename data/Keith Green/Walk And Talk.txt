Go to the hungry ones and fill them with his bread, 
 They'll leave their darkness as you shine the light he shed, 
 Point to his promises, believe in what he said, 
 And his joy will be manifest in you, 
 And the lost will be found as he works through you. 
 Out on the highways, there's so many passing by, 
 Step out in boldness and watch the family multiply, 
 Pray up some miracles, lets open up the sky, 
 And his joy will be manifest to you, 
 And the lost will be found by the things you do. 
 Oh don't you know that Jesus loves you, 
 So lets go and spread his word, 
 Redeem the time while there's still time, 
 Lets share the call we heard, lets share the call we heard. 
 Is your house open to let strangers enter there, 
 Give to the least of them, show them someone cares, 
 And you may be entertaining angels unaware, 
 And his joy may be manifest to you, 
 And the lost may be found as he works through you, 
 And his joy will be manifest in you, 
 And the lost, they'll be found by the things you do.

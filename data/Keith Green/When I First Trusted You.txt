Well I thought I depended upon you. 
 At least that used to be what was happening with me. 
 In those times of our first sweet communion, 
 Nothing got in the way, I heard your voice everyday. 
 When I first trusted you, gave my life to you. 
 When I trusted you. 
 Well there's something that needs to be cleared up. 
 I feel so sorry inside, that my first love has died. 
 'Cause I've tried in my own strength to follow. 
 When I've known all along, I just couldn't go wrong. 
 If I'd only trusted you, give my life to you. 
 If I'd trusted you. Ooh, trusted you. 
 Well I though I depended upon you. 
 At least that used to be what was happening with me. 
 In those times of our first sweet communion, 
 Nothing got in the way, I heard your voice everyday. 
 When I first trusted you, I gave my life to you. 
 When I trusted you.

My son, My son, why are you striving 
 You can't add one thing to what's been done for you 
 I did it all while I was dying 
 Rest in your faith, my peace will come to you 
 For when I hear the praises start 
 I want to rain upon you 
 Blessings that will fill your heart 
 I see no stain upon you 
 Because you are my child and you know me 
 To Me you're only holy 
 Nothing that you've done remains 
 Only what you do for Me 
 My child, My child, why are you weeping 
 You will not have to wait forever 
 That day and that hour is in My keeping 
 The day I'll bring you into Heaven 
 For when I hear the praises start 
 My child, I want to rain upon you 
 Blessing that will fill your heart 
 I see no stain upon you 
 Because you are My child and you know me 
 To me you're only holy 
 Nothing that you've done remains 
 Only what you do in Me 
 My precious bride, the day is nearing 
 When I'll take you in My arms and hold you 
 I know there are so many things that you've been hearing 
 But you just hold on to what I have told you 
 For when I hear the praises start 
 My bride, I want to rain upon you 
 Blessings that will fill your heart 
 I see no stain upon you 
 Because you are My child, and you know Me 
 To me you're only holy 
 Nothing that you've done will remain 
 Only what you do for me

Take some time, make a friend of a stranger, 
 Touch a hand, just reach out, there's no danger. 
 When there's love mountains move, 
 The blind can see and things improve. 
 Don't be afraid to take the lead, 
 And be the first to plant a seed, 
 And then just watch it grow, don't you know? 
 Take some time, tell someone that you love them, 
 Make them feel there's a rainbow above them. 
 When there's love storms will cease, 
 And those in chains will be released. 
 There's not a thing that love can't do, 
 But it's got to start with me and you, 
 And then just watch it grow, don't you know? 
 When there's love, you can't lose, 
 You'll always know which road to choose, 
 There's not one thing that love can't do, 
 But it's got to start with me and you. 
 And then just watch it grow, don't you know? 
 Take some time, make a friend of a stranger, 
 When there's love touch a hand, 
 Just reach out, there's no danger. 
 When there's love, take some time, 
 Make a friend of a stranger. 
 When there's love, touch a hand, 
 Just reach out, there's no danger. 
 When there's love, take the time, 
 Make a friend of a stranger.

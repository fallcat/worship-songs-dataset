How I love you, 
 You are the one, 
 You are the one. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one for me. 
 I was so lost, 
 But you showed the way, 
 'Cause you are the way. 
 I was so lost, 
 But you showed the way to me. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one, 
 You are the one. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one for me. 
 I was lied to, 
 But you told the truth, 
 'Cause you are the truth. 
 I was lied to, 
 But you showed the truth to me. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one, 
 You are the one. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one for me. 
 I was dying, 
 But you gave me life, 
 'Cause you are the life. 
 I was dying, 
 And you gave your life for me. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one, 
 You are the one. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one, 
 God's risen Son, 
 You are the one for me. 
 Hallelujah, 
 You are the one, 
 You are the one. 
 Hallelujah, 
 You are the one for me. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one, 
 You are the one. 
 How I love you, 
 You are the one for me.

I want you here with me 
 But you've been keeping other company 
 You can't sit still, it's plain to see 
 You love the world and you're avoiding me 
 My word sits there upon your desk 
 But you love your books and magazines the best 
 You prefer the light of your TV 
 You love the world, and you're avoiding me 
 You used to pray, you were so brave 
 Now you can't keep even one appointment we've made 
 Oh I gave my blood, to save you life 
 Tell me, tell me is it right? 
 Will you leave me here along again tonight? 
 Well I love you, still more and more 
 But you're fighting everything I'm working for 
 You're acting like my enemy 
 You love the world and you're avoiding me 
 These other loves, they're hurting you 
 If you end up losing me, then what will you do? 
 Oh, I gave my blood, to save your life 
 Tell me, tell me is it right? 
 Will you leave me here alone again tonight? 
 Well, I want you, here with me 
 But you've been keeping other company 
 You prefer the light of your TV 
 You love the world, and you're avoiding me 
 You love the world, you love the world 
 You love the world and you're avoiding me 
 Oh, you love the world 
 You love the world and you're avoiding me

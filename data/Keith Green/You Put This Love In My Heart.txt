I found it hard to believe 
 Someone like You cared for me 
 You put this love in my heart 
 I tried but could not refuse 
 You gave me no time to choose 
 You put this love in my heart 
 I wanna know where the bad feelings go 
 When I'm depressed and I get down so low 
 And then I see You coming to me, and it's alright 
 I wanna tell You right now 
 I'm not afraid to say how 
 You put this love in my heart 
 There are some times that I doubt 
 But You always find me out 
 You put this love in my heart 
 'Cause when I see all that you've done for me 
 It's hard to doubt, I just have to believe 
 'Cause You followed up, proven all of Your life 
 Well, I know the loneliness I had before 
 Is gone now, I'll never feel it anymore 
 'Cause Your loving has released me 
 From all that's in my past 
 And I know I can believe You, yeah 
 When You say I'll never be forsaken 
 Your love is gonna last 
 There's so much more I should say 
 If I could just find a way 
 You put this love in my heart 
 Is all this real or a dream? 
 I feel so good I could scream! 
 You put this love in my heart 
 I wanna know where the bad feelings go 
 When I'm depressed and I get down so low 
 And then I see You coming for me 
 And it's alright 
 You put this love in my heart 
 You put this love in my heart 
 You put this love in my heart...

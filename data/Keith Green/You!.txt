You 
 Who made the whole world with your hand 
 Walked along this land 
 Humbled as a man 
 You came down 
 And you changing the water to wine 
 Gave your greatest sign 
 By changing lives like mine 
 How did You know 
 I'd eventually go 
 And take you for the Lord of my life? 
 I'm so glad for 
 You 
 How did you stand the shame 
 When they laughed at your name 
 Your Father felt such pain 
 Well how'd you take it 
 But You 
 Spoke not a word to defend 
 'Cause they'd see in the end 
 When you rose again 
 Whenever you spoke 
 All the demons awoke 
 And would tremble with fear at your sight 
 And you 
 Loving a world filled with hate 
 And though the hour is late 
 You still chose to wait 
 But it won't be long until 
 You 
 Take the whole world by surprise 
 They won't believe their eyes 
 When You come through the skies 
 When You return 
 All the foolish will learn 
 That they waited too long to decide 
 Don't wait too long to decide

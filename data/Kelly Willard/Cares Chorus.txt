I cast all my cares upon You 
 I lay all of my burdens down at Your feet 
 And any time I don't know what to do 
 I will cast all my cares upon You 
 I cast all my cares upon You 
 I lay all of my burdens down at Your feet 
 And any time I don't know what to do 
 I will cast all my cares upon You 
 I cast all of my cares upon You 
 I lay all of my burdens down at Your feet 
 And any time that I don't know what to do 
 I will cast all my cares upon You 
 I will cast all my cares upon You

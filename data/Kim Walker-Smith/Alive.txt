You breathe Your life into my lungs, 
 You bring to life these dry bones, 
 I know that You're alive 
 You call me one of Your own 
 In my heart You made Your home 
 I know that You're alive 
 I'm coming alive 
 You call me one of Your own 
 In my heart You made Your home 
 I know that You're alive 
 I'm coming alive 
 I'm coming alive 
 I'm coming alive 
 We will make Him known 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive 
 We will shout it out 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive 
 To all the dry and weary souls 
 Take joy, take heart, be filled with hope 
 I know that He's alive 
 To all the ones who have no home 
 Get up and run, you're going home 
 I know that He's alive 
 I'm coming alive 
 I'm coming alive 
 I'm coming alive 
 We will make Him known 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive 
 We will shout it out 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive 
 It may get loud 
 The grave is empty now 
 It may get wild 
 His love is like no other 
 It may get loud 
 The grave is empty now 
 It may get wild 
 His love is like no other 
 It may get loud 
 The grave is empty now 
 It may get wild 
 His love is like no other 
 We will make Him known 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive 
 We will shout it out 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive 
 We will make Him known 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive 
 We will shout it out 
 Jesus is alive, He's alive

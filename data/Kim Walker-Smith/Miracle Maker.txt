I'm waiting here for my life to change, 
 When the waters stir You can rearrange me. 
 Just one touch is all I need, 
 I've nothing much but the wounds I feel, 
 I've come to find the hand of the miracle man. 
 Holy, You are holy, 
 Who was and is and is to come. 
 Holy, You are holy, 
 Saviour, healer, 
 I'm standing at the feet of the miracle maker. 
 I'm holding on, with Your life in mine, 
 Living water's come, 
 And You've rearranged me. 
 You are holy, You are holy, 
 Who was and is and is to come. 
 Holy, You are holy, 
 Saviour, healer, 
 I'm staring in the face of the miracle maker. 
 Holy, You are holy, 
 Who was and is and is to come. 
 Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 Thank you, Saviour, 
 I'm walking in the shoes of my miracle maker. 
 Holy, You are holy, 
 Who was and is and is to come. 
 Jesus, precious Jesus, 
 Thank you, Saviour, 
 I'm standing with the faith of a miracle maker.

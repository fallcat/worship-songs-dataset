In the morning, when I wake 
 I'm confronted with Your grace 
 All the pieces of my heart 
 They light up like the dawn against the dark 
 There is still music, in the pain 
 There is beauty, in all You've made 
 In the stillness of this place 
 We are standing together face to face 
 You say rise, You say rise 
 And draw me from the ashes of the night 
 So I rise, Yes I rise 
 To live inside the heart that beats with mine 
 Let surrender, be my song 
 When I've been running, for so long 
 And no battle, from where I've been 
 Could tear me from the arms that pull me in 
 You say rise, You say rise 
 And draw me from the ashes of the night 
 So I rise, Yes I rise 
 To live inside the heart that beats with mine 
 Oh, You hold my heart 
 Through every night, through every night 
 Hold me ever close 
 Never let me go, never let me go 
 You say rise, You say rise 
 And draw me from the ashes of the night 
 So I rise, Yes I rise 
 To live inside the heart that beats with mine 
 You say rise, You say rise 
 And draw me from the ashes of the night 
 So I rise, Yes I rise 
 To live inside the heart that beats with mine

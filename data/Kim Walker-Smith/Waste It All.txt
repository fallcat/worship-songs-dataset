Covered in shame, hiding my face 
 I owed a debt I could not pay 
 Searching in vain to fill my heart's ache 
 I threw my work away 
 When I thought all was lost 
 You saw me and You came to my defense 
 This priceless gift You gave 
 Was not meant for me to hold 
 I wanna waste it all on You 
 I wanna pour my heart's perfume 
 I don't care if I'm called a fool 
 I'm wasting it all on You 
 Lifting my head, holding my face 
 Wiping my endless tears away 
 You unlock my heart whispering grace 
 How could I leave this place? 
 When I'm here at Your feet 
 I can feel You, all the voices fade away 
 I will spend all my days 
 Giving back the love You gave 
 I'm gonna waste it all on You 
 I'm gonna pour my heart's perfume 
 I don't care if I'm called a fool 
 I'm wasting it all on You 
 I'm gonna waste it all on You 
 I'm gonna pour my heart's perfume 
 I don't care if I'm called a fool 
 I'm wasting it all on You 
 All for love and all for me 
 You gave it all for me to be 
 Alive in You and You in me 
 Lord I surrender 
 To Your love and to Your touch 
 And to the way You give too much 
 I'm too in love to not be all for You! 
 I'm gonna waste it all on You 
 I'm gonna pour my heart's perfume 
 I don't care if I'm called a fool 
 I'm wasting it all on You 
 I'm gonna waste it all on You 
 I'm gonna pour my heart's perfume 
 I don't care if I'm called a fool 
 I'm wasting it all on You 
 Wasting it all on You, Jesus 
 Let me come and pour my love on You 
 My sweet perfume 
 I'll waste it all on You God 
 Lift your voice tonight 
 Lift your voice tonight 
 Pour it out, all your love, all your worship on Him tonight 
 He is worthy, He is worthy, He is worthy 
 Oh and open up, I'll open up and pour it out 
 Pour out my love like perfume, on You Jesus 
 Hold nothing back, hold nothing back 
 I'll pour it all on You, my love, yes 
 Oh, You're so deserving, so deserving, God 
 With all I am and all I have, I give it all to You 
 I'm gonna waste it all on You 
 I'm gonna pour my heart's perfume 
 I don't care if I'm called a fool 
 I'm wasting it all on You 
 I'm gonna waste it all on You 
 I'm gonna pour my heart's perfume 
 I don't care if I'm called a fool 
 I'm wasting it all on You

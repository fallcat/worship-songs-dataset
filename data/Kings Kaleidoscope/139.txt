You heard my first heartbeat before I could breathe 
 Before my first cry, you knew me 
 You nit me together when I was conceived 
 When I was designed, you knew me 
 You know what I wondered before I could speak 
 Before my first thoughts, You know me 
 You see what I'm dreamin' when I go to sleep 
 When I'm waking up you know me 
 I could run away or hide beneath the sea 
 You'd still hear my thoughts 
 I could climb the peaks or die beyond the deep 
 You are always there 
 Crafted behaving and care for my soul 
 In all of your ways, You're holy 
 When I'm lost in darkness and far from my home 
 Your hand guides my way and holds me 
 I could run away or hide beneath the sea 
 You'd still hear my thoughts 
 I could climb the peaks or die beyond the deep 
 Oh, my God, You are there 
 You are the God who knows and loves me 
 The God of David, the lock of ages 
 You are the king who draws above me 
 The king who's eyin' the mighty lion 
 You are the God who knows and loves me 
 The God of David, the lock of ages 
 You are the king who draws above me 
 The king who's eyin' the mighty lion 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh

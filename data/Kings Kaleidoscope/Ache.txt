And I know it's alright 
 You are near every night 
 Always in my sight 
 Always in my mind 
 In the fear in the fight 
 In the pain in the plight 
 There's no hold on my life 
 And the dark there is light 
 When I feel so suppressed 
 All the things in my chest 
 And the fear doesn't rest 
 Oh you protect 
 Cause you see and you wake 
 And your heart doesn't wait 
 You're already there 
 Yes I've seen you 
 I've seen you

All creatures of our God and King 
 Lift up your voice and with us sing, 
 Oh Praise Him! Alleluia! 
 Thou burning sun with golden beam, 
 Thou silver moon with softer gleam! 
 O, praise Him! O, praise Him! 
 Thou rushing wind that art so strong 
 Ye clouds that sail in heaven along, 
 O praise Him! Alleluia! 
 Thou rising moon, in praise rejoice, 
 Ye lights of evening, find a voice! 
 Oh praise Him! Oh praise Him! 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 Let all things their Creator bless, 
 And worship Him in humbleness, 
 O praise Him! Alleluia! 
 Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son, 
 And praise the Spirit, Three in One! 
 Oh praise Him! Oh praise Him! 
 Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! 
 Oh Praise Him! 
 Alleluia!

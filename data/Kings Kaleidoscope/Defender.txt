A torrent of destruction hid 
 My darkened soul from rescuing 
 I cried to God for help, He heard my voice 
 The tainted earth, it rocked and reeled 
 The heavens bowed the mountains kneeled 
 The thunderous voice of God my covering 
 I will not be afraid 
 For my hope is in His name 
 Who is a rock but our God 
 Who's blood has sealed our freedom 
 Jesus, our savior, defender, redeemer 
 He brought me to a safer place 
 Equipped my hands and feet with strength 
 So I advance with confidence in Christ 
 His precious truth delivers me 
 From lies that wage a war in me 
 Your victory is mine for all my days 
 I will not be afraid 
 For my hope is in His name 
 You kneel down to raise me up 
 You my Lord, you my God 
 You rescue me with reckless love 
 Oh my Lord, oh my God

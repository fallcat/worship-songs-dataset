Once in a while I close my eyes 
 Drifting to sleep you come alive 
 My heart begins to sing in tune 
 And suddenly all I see is you 
 In sunlight, in moonbeams, in forests, in gold streams 
 The colors of your world, echo in my dreams 
 And I see you, I see you, I know you, I feel you 
 You're my joy, my life, my love, my light 
 In the moment, it's clear, and I know, yes I know 
 That I'm loved, I'm loved, I'm loved, I'm loved

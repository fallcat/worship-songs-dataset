Turn the lights on, look at what I have 
 See the twisted trophies of a dead man 
 Countless stories, tell of sin and pain 
 But they sing the sweetness of my savior's grace 
 I'm a torn man, spirit fighting flesh 
 There's a battle raging deep in my chest 
 But all that haunts me, all that leaves a stain 
 Only sings the sweetness of my savior's grace 
 A fortunate fall, my sins are stories of grace to recall 
 A fortunate fall, I glory in my sins forgiven 
 Jesus bought me, and now I am His 
 Dying with Him, in His death I now live 
 All my vices, to which I was chained 
 Only speak the sweetness of my savior's grace 
 And still I'm a wicked, wretched man, I do everything I hate 
 I am fighting to be god, I seethe and claw and thrash and shake 
 I have killed and stacked the dead, on a throne from which I reign 
 In the end I just want blood, and with His blood my hands are stained 
 See the God who reigns on high, He has opened His own veins 
 From His wounds a rushing torrent that can wash it all away 
 Grace upon grace, upon grace upon grace.

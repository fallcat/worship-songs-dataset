When my heart is weary, when my soul is weak 
 When it seems I can't traverse the trail before me 
 I survey the glory of your agony 
 And I find the will to fight for what's before me 
 Cause you ran the race enduring for your glory 
 I fix my eyes on you, the founder and the finisher of our faith 
 I fix my eyes on you, the solace in your suffering is my strength 
 As I fight to follow, you're my righteous guide 
 And you train me to delight in all that's holy 
 Heal my broken body, cure my crooked stride 
 Throw off every weight and sin that clings so closely 
 I will run the race enduring for your glory 
 You help me breathe, you're the only life I need 
 You died for me, you're the only life I need

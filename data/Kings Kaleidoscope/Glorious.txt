You came in a minute 
 You took me by surprise 
 With a love like summer air on a moonlit mountain side 
 When my mind was a prison 
 You gave me the keys to life 
 I cannot stop exclaiming 
 I cannot stop proclaiming 
 You are glorious 
 Holy Jehovah Divine 
 You are beautiful 
 King of Creation arise 
 Hear the earth sing an orchestra of life 
 You are my delight 
 You came in a minute 
 You took me by surprise 
 With a peace like winter snow falling softly through the sky 
 And now I am living confident in Christ 
 I cannot stop exclaiming 
 I cannot stop proclaiming 
 You are glorious 
 Holy Jehovah Divine 
 You are beautiful 
 King of Creation arise 
 Hear the earth sing an orchestra of life 
 You are my delight 
 In rocks and skies and trees 
 Your beauty revives me 
 You lift the waking burden from my shoulders 
 Your glory is all around 
 I'm caught up in the sound 
 Creation bows and sings, "All praise to the King!" 
 You are glorious 
 Holy Jehovah Divine 
 You are beautiful 
 King of Creation arise 
 Hear the earth sing an orchestra of life 
 You are my delight 
 You are divine

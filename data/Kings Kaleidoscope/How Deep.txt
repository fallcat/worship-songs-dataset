How deep the Father's love for us 
 How vast beyond all measure 
 That he should give his only Son 
 To make a wretch his treasure 
 How great the pain of searing loss, 
 The Father turns his face away 
 As wounds which mar the chosen One, 
 Bring many sons to glory 
 Behold the Man upon a cross, 
 My sin upon his shoulders 
 Ashamed I hear my mocking voice, 
 Call out among the scoffers 
 It was my sin that held him there 
 Until it was accomplished 
 His dying breath has brought me life 
 I know that it is finished 
 I will not boast in anything 
 No gifts, no power, no wisdom 
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ 
 His death and resurrection 
 Why should I gain from his reward? 
 I cannot give an answer 
 But this I know with all my heart 
 His wounds have paid my ransom

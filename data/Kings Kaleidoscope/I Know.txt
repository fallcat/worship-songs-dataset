Every day at dusk I chase the sunset, sunset 
 Looking for a glimpse of Heaven's skies 
 I've been given a taste for something 
 That nothing in this world can satisfy 
 But I know that a time is coming 
 When I will be in glorious delight 
 I know I will run through Heaven's brilliant streets of gold 
 Shouting "Hallelujah, Christ!" alone 
 I know I will dance and sing and bow before the throne 
 Yeah, this, I know. Oh-Oh. 
 Every day at dawn I chase the sunrise, sunrise 
 Looking for a hint of Heave's light 
 I've been given a taste for something 
 That nothing in this world can satisfy 
 But I know that a time is coming 
 When I will be in glorious delight 
 I know I will run through Heaven's brilliant streets of gold 
 Shouting "Hallelujah, Christ!" alone 
 I know I will dance and sing and bow before the throne 
 Yeah, this, I know. Oh-Oh. 
 I know I will run through Heaven's brilliant streets of gold

 I know I will dance and sing and bow before the throne 
 Yeah, this, I know. Oh-Oh. 
 This I know. This I know. This I know.

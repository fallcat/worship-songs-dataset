You're light after darkness, gain after loss. 
 Strength after weakness, crowned at the cross. 
 Sweet after bitter, hope after fears. 
 Harm after wandering, praise after tears. 
 Seeds after sowing, sun after rain 
 Sight after mystery, peace after pain. 
 Joy after sorrow, calm after gassed 
 Rest after weariness sweetness at last 
 Give me the hope of tomorrow. 
 Give me the strength of today. 
 You are the promise of peace, my pathway to faith 
 Give me the hope of tomorrow. 
 Give me the strength of today. 
 You are the promise of peace, my pathway to faith 
 Near after distant, gleam after good 
 Love after loneliness, life after tomb 
 After the agony, rapture of bliss 
 Glory awaits beyond the abyss. 
 Give me the hope of tomorrow. 
 Give me the strength of today. 
 You are the promise of peace, my pathway to faith 
 Give me the hope of tomorrow. 
 Give me the strength of today. 
 You are the promise of peace, my pathway to faith

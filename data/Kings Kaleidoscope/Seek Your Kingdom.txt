I've been anxious 
 I can't sleep 
 Worthless worries 
 Burden me 
 I hunt the sun 
 Chase the wind 
 Till my tired spirit spins into the ground 
 When I try to 
 Take control 
 Fear and terror 
 Grip my soul 
 I need joy 
 I need peace 
 I need rest, I need relief 
 I look to You 
 And You teach me to 
 Seek your Kingdom 
 Seek your righteousness 
 See the ravens 
 They can't farm 
 Don't have silos 
 Truck or barns 
 But our God 
 Sees their needs 
 And He loves them 
 And He feeds them everyday 
 See the lilies 
 How they grow 
 They don't work or 
 Buy their clothes 
 But if God 
 By his grace 
 Clothes the grass with great array 
 Then how much more 
 Is there in store 
 When I 
 Seek your Kingdom 
 Seek your righteousness 
 When I'm worried about tomorrow (Seek your Kingdom Seek your righteousness) 
 I'll fix my eyes on You 
 You'll take me home

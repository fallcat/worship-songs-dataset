Maybe someday we'll meet under the stars 
 Healed and home free, complete, that's where we'll start 
 Zion, I'm coming soon to where you are 
 Till then my love's with you, though world's apart 
 This will take much longer than I've planned 
 But I will wait to see you, and hold your hands 
 Waiting each day, God will comfort my soul 
 You are home now, healthy, safe in His fold 
 Beyond this storm's a brilliant sky of stars 
 I'll follow you

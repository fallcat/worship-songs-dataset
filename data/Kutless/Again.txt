Awakened from a dream again to a sunrise of Your own 
 How could I expect any more from the one who is so pure 
 Yet you gave up Your life and Your still giving more 
 This must imply that, 
 Love again, again, again 
 I don't deserve this love You gave 
 Love again, again, again 
 I don't deserve this love You gave to me 
 A fountain flows with gifts from you 
 That I do nothing for 
 You cover me with Your love though I nailed You to a cross 
 I don't understand but I thank you the same 
 This must imply that

Icy chills round your heart 
 A heart that's made of stone 
 It seems like life is out to get you 
 To destroy what you want 
 I know that, that you blame Me 
 For all that you go through 
 It could be, so different, 
 If you would just let it go. 
 You're all alone, running out of ways to 
 Hold on to hope, and it always slips away 
 You're all alone, but you don't have to 
 Pretend to cope, there is a brighter way 
 If you would change your perspective 
 You'd see that it is true 
 Life is not always what you want 
 Sometimes it's hard to bear 
 I'd be with you, and help you 
 In all that you go through 
 I love you, let Me change your heart 
 By coming in 
 You're all alone, running out of ways to 
 Hold on to hope, and it always slips away 
 You're all alone, but you don't have to 
 Pretend to cope, there is a brighter way 
 A way... 
 There is a brighter way Yeah 
 There is a brighter way 
 You're all alone, running out of ways to 
 Hold on to hope, and it always slips away 
 You're all alone, but you don't have to 
 Pretend to cope, there is a brighter way 
 A way... 
 There is a brighter way, yeah 
 There is a brighter way 
 (Hold on to hope) 
 There is a brighter way 
 (Hold on to hope) 
 There is a brighter way...

How do I speak of the indescribable to You? 
 I will try to explain these feelings that are true 
 So looking to the sky I will sing 
 And from my heart to You I bring 
 All of the words in all of my life 
 That could never explain and never describe 
 All of my love, which is nothing to hide 
 So I lift up my hands and I worship, I worship You 
 In Your presence I forever choose to live 
 I will praise You for it's all I have to give 
 So looking to the sky I will sing and from my heart to You I bring 
 All of the words in all of my life 
 That could never explain and never describe 
 All of my love, which is nothing to hide 
 So I lift up my hands and I worship 
 By Your grace You let me come and talk to You 
 It's not that I'm worthy 
 I thank You Jesus 
 For the love that You have shown 
 All of the words in all of my life 
 That could never explain and never describe 
 All of my love, which is nothing to hide 
 So I lift up my hands and I worship 
 With all of the words in all of my life 
 That could never explain and never describe 
 All of my love, which is nothing to hide 
 So I lift up my hands and I worship, I worship You

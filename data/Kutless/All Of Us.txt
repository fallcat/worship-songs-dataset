As soon as You stepped through my door, 
 I saw You for the first time all over again. 
 And time well spent seems 
 Lonelier than the way it used to go. 
 I smell You for the first time all over again 
 I'll begin to remember to feel alive 
 So if you don't mind 
 I think I'll wear my heart on my sleeve, 
 'Cause I'm tired of not being able to breathe. 
 All of us are searching for an open arm. 
 Well, it's a shame how I curl up in the dark. 
 When it's the same old word giving me the spark. 
 All of us are searching for an open arm. 
 Well, it's a shame how I curl up in the dark. 
 I failed the lost 
 For some time I slipped, stumbled, 
 But fell face first straight 
 In Your hand. 
 Then I hit my head on Your palm 
 And wakened up to the smell of 
 Tears drying up in the sand. 
 All of us are searching for an open arm. 
 Well, it's a shame how I curl up in the dark. 
 When it's the same old word giving me the spark. 
 All of us are searching for an open arm. 
 Well, it's a shame how I curl up in the dark. 
 I washed my wounds with tears of hope. 
 I washed my wounds with tears of hope. 
 I just ... 
 All of us are searching for an open arm 
 Well, it's a shame how I pull myself apart. 
 When it's the same words making me run for cover to Your arms. 
 All of us are searching for an open arm. 
 When it's the same words making me run for cover to Your arms. 
 All of us are searching for an open arm.

I lift my eyes up to You 
 Father, healer, friend 
 My one desire is to know You, God 
 My soul was made for You 
 Jesus, I live for You 
 I'm Yours, every beat of my heart 
 I'm Yours, here to reflect who You are 
 I'm desperate for You, desperate for You 
 Jesus, I surrender it all 
 All to You 
 I lift my life up to You 
 Creator, savior, friend 
 My one desire is to know You, God 
 My soul will sing for You 
 Jesus, I worship You 
 I'm Yours, every beat of my heart 
 I'm Yours, here to reflect who You are 
 I'm desperate for You, desperate for You 
 Jesus, I surrender it all 
 Almighty, all glorious 
 God upon the throne, we live to worship You alone 
 Almighty, all glorious 
 God upon the throne, we live to worship You alone, alone 
 I'm Yours, every beat of my heart 
 I'm Yours, here to reflect who You are 
 I'm desperate for You, desperate for You 
 I'm Yours, every beat of my heart 
 I'm Yours, here to reflect who You are 
 I'm desperate for You, desperate for You 
 Jesus, I surrender it all 
 Jesus, I surrender it all 
 All to You

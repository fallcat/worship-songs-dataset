All who are thirsty 
 All who are weak 
 Just come to the fountain 
 Dip your heart in the stream of life 
 Let the pain and the sorrow 
 Be washed away 
 In the waves of His mercy 
 As the deep cries out to deep, we sing... 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 All who are thirsty 
 All who are weak 
 Just come to the fountain 
 Dip your heart in the stream of life 
 Let the pain and the sorrow 
 Be washed away 
 In the waves of His mercy 
 As the deep cries out to deep, we sing... 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Won't You come 
 Won't You come 
 Nothing but Your will for me 
 I am only free won't You come 
 Nothing but Your will for me 
 I am only free won't You come 
 Come Lord Jesus, come 
 Nothing but Your will for me 
 I am only free won't You come 
 Come Lord Jesus, come

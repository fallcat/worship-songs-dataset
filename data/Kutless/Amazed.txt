Open up, my eyes to see 
 All of you, your mysteries 
 I hold my breath, you hold my hand 
 As heaven melts the heart of man 
 How amazed I am 
 Your glory fills the sky, 
 A great and holy light 
 Shining like a million stars, 
 I'm amazed by who you are 
 Lord we lift you high, 
 Oh God be magnified 
 You have overwhelmed my heart, 
 I'm amazed by who you are 
 The universe, is at your feet 
 And angels bow, when you speak 
 So high above, our greatest song 
 But still you call 
 And we will come 
 How amazed I am 
 Your glory fills the sky, 
 A great and holy light 
 Shining like a million stars, 
 I'm amazed by who you are 
 Lord we lift you high, 
 Oh God be magnified 
 You have overwhelmed my heart, 
 I'm amazed by who you are 
 Your glory fills the skies, 
 A great and holy light 
 Shining like a million stars, 
 I'm amazed by who you are 
 Lord we lift you high, 
 Oh God be magnified 
 You have overwhelmed my heart, 
 I'm amazed by who you are 
 You are...

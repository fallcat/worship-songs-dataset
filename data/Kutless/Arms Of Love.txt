I sing a simple song of love 
 To my Savior, to my Jesus 
 I'm thankful for the things You've done 
 My loving Savior, my precious Jesus 
 My heart is glad 
 That You've called me Your own 
 'Cause there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than in Your arms of love 
 In Your arms of love 
 Holding me still 
 Holding me near 
 In Your arms of love 
 I sing a simple song of love 
 To my Savior, to my Jesus 
 I'm thankful for the things You've done 
 My loving Savior, my precious Jesus 
 My heart is glad 
 That You've called me Your own 
 'Cause there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than in Your arms of love 
 In Your arms of love 
 Holding me still, holding me near 
 Holding me still, holding me near 
 In Your arms of love 
 'Cause there's no place I'd rather be 
 Than in Your arms of love 
 In Your arms of love 
 Holding me still 
 Holding me near 
 Holding me still 
 Holding me near 
 Holding me still 
 Holding me near 
 In Your arms of love

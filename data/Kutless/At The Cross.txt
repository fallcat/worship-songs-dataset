Into the darkness came the Light 
 Oh the Savior lifted high 
 Through a perfect Sacrifice 
 My soul has been redeemed 
 Reaching out Your arms to save 
 You alone have made a way 
 My sin has been erased 
 Forever I will sing 
 At the cross I am found, I am free 
 Oh the love You poured out over me 
 Here I am, may I ever be 
 At the cross, 'cause it's enough for me 
 I don't need another sign 
 A miracle before my eyes 
 To believe Your love is mine 
 Your promise is complete 
 Jesus You have set me free 
 Every chain has been released 
 You are my victory 
 This truth will never change 
 At the cross I am found, I am free 
 Oh the love You poured out over me 
 Here I have all ill ever need 
 Oh the cross, it's enough for me 
 What You've done, it's enough, all I need 
 Here I stand, lifted hands, I believe

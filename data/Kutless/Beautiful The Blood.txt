I never knew death could be so sweet 
 I never knew surrender could feel so free 
 I've never seen such meekness and majesty 
 But the blood of Jesus was bled for me 
 Now I'll sing freedom for all of my days 
 It's only by the power of the cross I'm raised 
 The king of glory rescued me 
 How beautiful the blood flow 
 How merciful the love shown 
 The king of glory poured out 
 Victorious are we now 
 I never knew these nails would love unfold 
 I never knew these wounds would heal my soul 
 I've never seen such beauty 
 And sorrow means that the blood of Jesus was bled for me 
 Now I've seen freedom for all of my days 
 It's only by the power of the cross I'm raised 
 The king of glory rescued me 
 How beautiful the blood flow 
 How merciful the love shown 
 The king of glory poured out 
 Victorious are we now 
 Now I'll sing freedom for all of my days 
 It's only by the power of the cross I'm raised 
 The king of glory rescued me 
 How beautiful the blood flow 
 How merciful the love shown 
 The king of glory poured out 
 Victorious are we now 
 How beautiful you are 
 How merciful you are 
 How glorious you are 
 Christ, my savior

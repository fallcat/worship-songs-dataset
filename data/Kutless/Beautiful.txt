The weather outside tells me that snow's on it's way 
 As trees turn to white my troubles inside are losing their colors the same 
 It feels like forever since I remember the power of your love for me 
 It's beautiful a child, a savior, a king 
 With love like the world's never seen 
 It's beautiful the bright shining star in the east 
 As angels sing "Gloria, unto us a savior is born", It's beautiful 
 Lights and the trees 
 Remind me of the reason you came 
 Light of the world on Calvary 
 The son of man came here to save 
 It's beautiful a child, a savior, a king 
 With love like the world's never seen 
 It's beautiful the bright shining star in the east 
 As angels sing "Gloria, unto us a savior is born", it's beautiful 
 All is made white and God has redeemed us 
 Together we'll sing of his glory 
 It's beautiful a child, a savior, a king 
 With love like the world's never seen 
 It's beautiful the bright shining star in the east 
 As angels sing 
 It's beautiful the child, the savior, a king 
 With love like the world's never seen 
 It's beautiful the bright shining star in the east 
 As angels sing "Gloria, unto us a savior is born", it's beautiful

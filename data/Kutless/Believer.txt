I can see through the laughter 
 I know you've cried your share of tears 
 But you don't have to do this by yourself 
 You tell me that you feel abandoned 
 Carrying the weight of all this pain inside 
 You trust in someone else 
 But you're crying out for help 
 I'm a believer 
 That He's strong enough to hold you now where you are 
 I'm a believer 
 In the One who's always reaching out to your heart 
 He understands you 
 There's not a greater love that you'll find in this life 
 I'm a believer in Christ 
 You're trying to escape the landslide 
 Running from the choices that you've made 
 When will you surrender to His grace 
 He promises He'll never leave you 
 Offering to free you from your past 
 Cause that's the sacrifice He's made 
 He can be your shelter and your strength 
 No matter what you've done 
 Or how far you've run 
 There is hope for you 
 For every broken heart 
 He'll meet you where you are 
 He will rescue you 
 Let Him rescue you

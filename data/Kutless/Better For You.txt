My decision can not be put off again, 
 I see the right choice, 
 But my heart is filled with dread 
 It all seems backwards in my head, my head 
 I know it seems too wrong to be right 
 This way is so much harder than fight 
 But in the end I know it's true 
 This way is better, it's better for you 
 Choose a little pain and gain a life with joy 
 Accepting pleasure now 
 Will earn a life of pain 
 It all seems backwards in my head, my head 
 I know it seems too wrong to be right 
 This way is so much harder than fight 
 But in the end I know it's true 
 This way is better, it's better for you 
 Sometimes I wonder why it's this way 
 When it's done the burden is gone 
 This discomfort will be taken away 
 As soon as it's over, it's over for me 
 I know it seems too wrong to be right 
 This way is so much harder than fight 
 But in the end I know it's true 
 This way is better, it's better for you

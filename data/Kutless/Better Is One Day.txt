How lovely is Your dwelling place 
 Oh Lord Almighty 
 My soul doth long and even faints for You 
 For here my heart is satisfied 
 Within Your presence 
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere

 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 My heart and flesh cry out 
 To You the living God 
 Your Spirit's water to my soul 
 I've tasted and I've seen 
 Come once again to me 
 I will draw near to You, 
 I will draw near to You 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts

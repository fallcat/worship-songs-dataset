I've been hiding, hiding for so long 
 Right behind my digital mask 
 I've been trying to be someone I'm not 
 All these perfectly fake people push us to insane ideals 
 They're nothing more than counterfeit images 
 That push me away, to bleed out the pain 
 Don't you dare make another move 
 Put the knife away, that's not what anybody needs 
 There's a better way than everything now that you see 
 Stop comparing who you are to who you want to be 
 Let's step out beyond the surface 
 Don't give in to everything the world around tells you to be 
 Open up your mind release yourself 
 Stop the lying, stop comparing who you are to what you see 
 Never letting fear hold back the change 
 And push you away, to bleed out the pain 
 Don't you dare make another move

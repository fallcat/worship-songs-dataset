I have traveled many moonless nights 
 Cold and weary with a babe inside 
 And I wonder what I've done 
 Holy Father, You have come 
 And chosen me now to carry Your Son 
 I am waiting in a silent prayer 
 I am frightened by the load I bear 
 In a world as cold as stone 
 Must I walk this path alone? 
 Be with me now, be with me now 
 Breath of Heaven, hold me together 
 Be forever near me, breath of Heaven 
 Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness 
 Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy 
 Breath of Heaven 
 Do you wonder as you watch my face 
 If a wiser one should have had my place? 
 But I offer all I am 
 For the mercy of Your plan 
 Help me be strong, help me be, help me 
 Breath of Heaven, hold me together 
 Be forever near me, breath of Heaven 
 Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness 
 Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy 
 Breath of Heaven, hold me together 
 Be forever near me, breath of Heaven 
 Breath of Heaven, lighten my darkness 
 Pour over me Your holiness for You are holy 
 Breath of Heaven, breath of Heaven

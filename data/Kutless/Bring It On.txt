All the pain in the headlines, all the heartache of our crimes 
 The innocent, the helpless, here and gone 
 So we call out to Your name, save us, from our shame 
 We're crying out to heaven, how long, how long 
 There's a new world on the way 
 When this one is gone, gone, gone 
 We're ready Jesus, bring it on, bring it on 
 We've had enough of darkness, we're waiting for the dawn 
 There's a kingdom coming, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 We are holding, to the promise, even now You are with us 
 Our every hope is in what You will do 
 Every wrong will be made right, every tear will run dry 
 We're praying that day is coming soon 
 There's a new world on the way 
 When this one is gone, gone, gone 
 We're ready Jesus, bring it on, bring it on 
 We've had enough of darkness, we're waiting for the dawn 
 There's a kingdom coming, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 Bring it on 
 We're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting 
 For you Jesus, we're waiting, for You 
 We're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting 
 For you Jesus, we're waiting, for You 
 There's a new world on the way 
 When this one is gone, gone, gone 
 We're ready Jesus, bring it on, bring it on 
 We've had enough of darkness, we're waiting for the dawn 
 There's a kingdom coming, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 Bring it on

When the path is daunting 
 And every step exhausting 
 I'm not alone 
 I'm not alone, no, no 
 I feel you draw me closer 
 All these burdens on my shoulder 
 I'm not alone, I'm not alone 
 You pull me me from this place 
 Hallelujah 
 You carry me every day 
 You carry me all all the way 
 Hallelujah 
 You carry me to the 
 You carry me to the cross 
 How your love has moved me, yeah 
 To the foot of all your glory 
 I'm not alone, I'm not alone 
 I'm not alone 
 Hallelujah 
 You carry me every day 
 You carry me all all the way 
 Hallelujah 
 You carry me to the 
 You carry me to the cross 
 All of these cities you have built 
 And every cathedral you have filled 
 To all of creation you gave life with your hands 
 And with those hands you comfort me 
 You lift me up from my knees 
 And carry me 
 You carry me 
 Hallelujah 
 You carry me every day 
 You carry me all all the way 
 Hallelujah 
 You carry me to the 
 You carry me to the cross 
 The cross 
 You carry me to the 
 You carry me to the cross

There is strength in my weakness 
 That only comes from you (only comes from you) 
 There is power in meekness 
 That I have found in you 
 Where else can I go 
 You know I'm weak 
 I know you're strong 
 You say when I'm broken 
 And can't carry on 
 Carry on 
 Carry on 
 When all my strength is gone 
 You're still holding on 
 There is love for the lonely 
 That only comes from you 
 There is peace and forgiveness 
 That I have found in you 
 Where else can I go? 
 You are the way 
 You are the light 
 You are the voice calling me through the night 
 Carry on 
 Carry on 
 When all my strength is gone 
 You're still holding on 
 You're holding on 
 You're still holding on 
 You are Holy and just 
 Full of mercy and love 
 You are patiend and kind 
 Your grace has opened my eyes 
 You know I'm weak 
 I know you're strong 
 You say when I'm broken 
 And can't carry on 
 Carry on 
 Carry on 
 You know I'm weak 
 I know you're strong 
 You say when I'm broken 
 And can't carry on 
 When all my strength is gone 
 You're still holding on 
 You are holding on

You see of the eyes of the hopeless ones 
 You see the pain hear their cry for help 
 You've turned your back, turned your back for far too long 
 'Cause its easier to feed the apathy within yourself 
 Maybe this time it's your time to change the world 
 Hey this is your wake up call 
 It's your one shot to give it all 
 This is a chance this is a chance of a lifetime 
 Hey you don't wanna let it all fade away 
 Tomorrow can't wait today 
 This is the chance of a lifetime 
 Oh just a little bit of give can take 
 A world of hurt and pain away 
 Will we step up or stand by and hesitate 
 Hey this is your wake up call 
 It's your one shot to give it all 
 This is a chance this is a chance of a lifetime 
 Hey you don't wanna let it all fade away 
 Tomorrow can't wait today 
 This is the chance of a lifetime, chance of a lifetime 
 'Cause we're all called to love 
 Why is that so tough 
 So tell me what your gonna do 
 What your gonna do... 
 Hey this is your wake up call 
 It's your one shot to give it all 
 This is a chance this is a chance of a lifetime 
 Hey you don't wanna let it all fade away 
 Tomorrow can't wait today 
 This is the chance of a lifetime, chance of a lifetime

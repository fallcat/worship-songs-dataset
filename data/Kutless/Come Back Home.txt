How long till you come to the end of your reckless streak 
 How long till the freedom weighs you down 
 How long till your heart figures out that you need me 
 How long until you turn around 
 When you come back home 
 I'll be running out to meet you 
 When you come back home 
 You'll find that I've never left you 
 You'll see every wrong turn every bridge you've burned 
 It's all forgiven and gone 
 When you come back home 
 When you come back home 
 I wanna see that face that I've been missing so much 
 I want to wrap my arms around your neck 
 I want to welcome you back to the place where you belong 
 I want to show you love has never left 
 I've paid the price so have no fear 
 There's nothing but mercy here yeah 
 Mercy is waiting 
 When you come back home

Incomplete it all began 
 The broken state that I was in 
 I wished that I was someone else 
 Cause' I was lost inside myself 
 I started seeing who I am 
 The day my life with you began 
 You clearly solved the mystery 
 That finding you meant finding me. 
 God, I've fallen to my knees 
 I'm bowing at your feet 
 I give you all of me 
 In you I am complete 
 It's all because of love 
 I'm not who I was 
 I'm who I meant to be 
 In you I am complete 
 God who doesn't need at all 
 I heard your voice I felt your call 
 It's echoing I cannot shake you off. 
 The stars that shine they bear your name 
 They sing the song that gives you praise 
 You've captured me 
 My heart is lifting off 
 God, I've fallen to my knees 
 I'm bowing at your feet 
 I give you all of me 
 In you I am complete 
 It's all because of love 
 I'm not who I was 
 I'm who I meant to be 
 In you I am complete 
 I've got to tell the world about the things you've done 
 I want to shout it out, I'm gonna live it now 
 Amazing grace is why I'm singing 
 God, I've fallen to my knees 
 I'm bowing at your feet 
 I give you all of me 
 In you I am complete 
 It's all because of love 
 I'm not who I was 
 I'm who I meant to be 
 In you I am complete

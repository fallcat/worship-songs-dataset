My hope is built on nothing less 
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness 
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame 
 But holy trust in Jesus' name 
 Christ alone, cornerstone 
 Weak made strong 
 In the savior's love 
 Through the storm 
 He is Lord 
 Lord of all 
 When darkness seems to hide his face 
 I rest on his unchanging grace 
 In every high and stormy gale 
 My anchor holds within the veil 
 Christ alone, cornerstone 
 Weak made strong 
 In the savior's love 
 Through the storm 
 He is Lord 
 Lord of all 
 He is Lord 
 Lord of all 
 Christ alone, cornerstone 
 Weak made strong 
 In the savior's love 
 Through the storm 
 He is Lord 
 Lord of all 
 Lord of all 
 Christ alone, he is Lord 
 Lord of all

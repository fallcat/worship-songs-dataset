A young girl walks into a room 
 And doesn't like what she sees 
 In her reflection there 
 She's not what she wants to be 
 She cries out, she cries out 
 The frustrations of this life 
 Are filling her head 
 How could such a simple thing 
 Have a grip so intense 
 She cries out, she cries out 
 I want to be like the movie stars 
 And models on the screen 
 She wants to fly away from this 
 She wants to fly away from this 
 But she does not know how to 
 Fly away from this 
 She wants to fly away 
 She tries just to be what she's not 
 But she's destroying herself 
 She starves herself 
 This compulsion must end 
 She cries out, she cries out 
 I want to be like the movie stars 
 And models on the screen 
 She wants to fly away from this 
 She wants to fly away from this 
 But she does not know how to 
 Fly away from this 
 She wants to fly away 
 This addiction is bringing her down 
 This obsession is bringing her down 
 She wants to fly away from this 
 Fly away from this 
 She wants to fly away from this 
 But only God knows how to 
 Fly away from this 
 He will help her now to 
 Fly away from this 
 She wants to fly away 
 Fly away

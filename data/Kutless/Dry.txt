Do you remember 
 That day of your life 
 It seemed like yesterday 
 That joy it filled my heart 
 It doesn't feel the same 
 And I'm feeling dry 
 Amidst my pain 
 Now something's different 
 The times oh they have changed 
 The love's the same 
 Yet emotion's running dry 
 The feeling's gone 
 But I know you're still there 
 I guess it's just part of life 
 That I must bare 
 It doesn't feel the same 
 And I'm feeling down 
 Amidst my pain 
 I see all my shame 
 And I'm feeling dry 
 But who am I to complain 
 Who am I to complain 
 I'm still free 
 You've set me free 
 It doesn't feel the same 
 And I'm feeling down 
 Amidst my pain 
 I see all my shame 
 And I'm feeling dry 
 But who am I to complain 
 It doesn't feel the same 
 And I'm feeling down 
 Amidst my pain 
 I see all my shame 
 And I'm feeling dry 
 But who am I to complain

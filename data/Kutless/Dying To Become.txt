Stop now. I'm overreaching 
 Once again I think I'm in the right 
 I'm trying too hard to let go 
 How can I let you lead me 
 If I'm a broken satellite 
 Wandering out on my own 
 We draw the lines 
 And we cross them too 
 We don't know what we've done 
 But it's what we do 
 Dying to become more like You 
 I never meant to disrespect you 
 But that's exactly what I've done 
 What am I trying to prove 
 When will I stop and trust you 
 I know that you're the only one 
 How am I blind to the truth 
 We draw the lines 
 And we cross them too 
 We don't know what we've done 
 But it's what we do 
 Dying to become more like You

Sometimes all we have to hold on to 
 Is what we know is true of who You are. 
 So when the heartache hits like a hurricane 
 That could never change who You are. 
 And we trust in who You are 
 Even if the healing doesn't come 
 And life falls apart 
 And dreams are still undone 
 You are God You are good 
 Forever faithful One 
 Even if the healing 
 Even if the healing doesn't come 
 Lord we know Your ways are not our ways 
 So we set our faith in who You are 
 Even though You reign high above us 
 You tenderly love us We know Your heart 
 And we rest in who You are 
 Even if the healing doesn't come 
 And life falls apart 
 And dreams are still undone 
 You are God You are good 
 Forever faithful One 
 Even if the healing 
 Even if the healing doesn't come 
 You're still the Great and Mighty One 
 We trust You always 
 You're working all things for our good 
 We'll sing your praise. 
 Even if the healing doesn't come 
 And life falls apart 
 And dreams are still undone 
 You are God You are good 
 Forever faithful One 
 Even if the healing 
 Even if the healing doesn't come 
 You are God and we will bless You 
 As the Good and Faithful One 
 You are God and we will bless You 
 Even if the healing doesn't come 
 Even if the healing doesn't come

When every step is so hard to take 
 And all of my hope is fading away 
 When life is a mountain that I can not climb 
 You carry me, Jesus carry me. 
 You are strength in my weakness 
 You are the refuge I seek 
 You are everything in my time of need 
 You are everything, You are everything I need 
 When every moment is more than I can take 
 And all of my strength is slipping away 
 When every breath gets harder to breathe 
 You carry me, Jesus carry me 
 You Are strength in my weakness 
 You are the refuge I seek 
 You are everything in my time of need 
 You are everything, You are everything I need 
 I need You 
 You are everything I need 
 I love everything about You 
 You are strength in my weakness 
 You are the refuge I seek 
 You are everything in my time of need 
 You are everything, You are everything I need

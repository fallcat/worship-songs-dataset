All to Jesus I surrender 
 All to Him I freely give 
 I will ever love and trust Him 
 In His presence, daily live 
 I give all of me to the God who gave it all 
 Surrender everything to the Savior on the cross 
 Forgiven and set free 
 I give all of me to the God who gave it all 
 All to Jesus I surrender 
 Humbly at His feet I bow 
 Worldly pleasures, all forsaken 
 Take me, Jesus, take me now 
 I give all of me to the God who gave it all 
 Surrender everything to the Savior on the cross 
 Forgiven and set free, I give all of me 
 To the God who gave it all 
 Who gave it all 
 You gave it all 
 So I give my all 
 To the God who gave it all 
 All to Jesus I surrender 
 Make me, Savior, wholly Thine 
 Let me feel thy Holy Spirit 
 Truly know that Thou art mine 
 I give all of me to the God who gave it all 
 Surrender everything to the Savior on the cross 
 Forgiven and set free, I give all of me 
 To the God who gave it all 
 To the God who gave it all 
 To the God who gave it all

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees 
 Oh Spirit, come make us humble 
 We turn our eyes from evil things 
 Oh Lord, we cast down our idols 
 So give us clean hands, give us pure hearts 
 Let us not lift our souls to another 
 Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts 
 Let us not lift our souls to another 
 We bow our hearts, we bend our knees 
 Oh Spirit, come make us humble 
 We turn our eyes from evil things 
 Oh Lord, we cast down our idols 
 So give us clean hands, give us pure hearts 
 Let us not lift our souls to another 
 Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts 
 Let us not lift our souls to another 
 And God, let us be a generation that seeks 
 Seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob 
 And God, let us be a generation that seeks 
 Seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob 
 You're my God, You're my God, oh oh 
 God, let us be a generation that seeks 
 Seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob 
 And God, let us be a generation that seeks 
 Seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob 
 And God, let us be a generation that seeks 
 Seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob 
 And God, let us be a generation that seeks 
 Seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob

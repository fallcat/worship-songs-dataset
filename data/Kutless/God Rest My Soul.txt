When the day is done and the striving ends, 
 There's a place where every heavy heart 
 Can find the strength to stand, here I am. 
 You're my only hope, my solid ground, 
 Always faithful and forever God, to You alone I bow, 
 Here I am, here I am 
 God rest my soul, I lay me down, 
 To lose myself in the grace I've found, 
 Oh to die and rise with Christ alone, 
 Take my life, God rest my soul 
 On a lonely hill You were lifted high, 
 Oh the wonder of Your sacrifice it overwhelms my life, 
 Here I am, here I am. 
 You have overcome every enemy, 
 Even death has lost its grip on me, I stand in victory 
 God rest my soul, I lay me down, 
 To lose myself in the grace I've found, 
 Oh to die and rise with Christ alone, 
 Take my life, God rest my soul 
 I surrender, surrender, 
 I surrender, 
 Jesus, I surrender, surrender, 
 I surrender. 
 God rest my soul, I lay me down, 
 To lose myself in the grace I've found, 
 Oh to die and rise with Christ alone, 
 Take my life, God rest my soul 
 Oh, I lay me down, 
 To lose myself in the grace I've found, 
 Oh to die and rise with Christ alone, 
 Take my life, God rest my soul

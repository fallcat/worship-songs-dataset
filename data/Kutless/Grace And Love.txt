Many things in life are hard for me 
 Many things can pull us down 
 I don't understand 
 Why I do what I do 
 How could I take my eyes off you? 
 After all You've done for me 
 And after all You've done for me 
 And It's by grace and love 
 I am saved 
 And It's by grace and love 
 You've forgiven me 
 And by that love and grace 
 I'm amazed 
 And It's by grace and love 
 I am Free 
 I am free 
 I am free 
 I am free 
 And it's by grace and love that I am free 
 I'll live with You eternally 
 I thank you Lord That I am free 
 I thank you Lord for loving me 
 I thank you Lord for dying 
 Upon the tree of Calvary 
 I thank you Lord for loving me 
 I thank you Lord for dying for me 
 'Cause It's by grace and love 
 I am saved 
 (I am saved by your...) 
 And It's by grace and love 
 You've forgiven me 
 (You've forgiven me...) 
 And by that love and grace 
 I'm amazed 
 (I stand amazed by your...) 
 And It's by grace and love 
 I am free 
 I am free 
 I am free 
 I am free 
 And Many things in life are hard for me 
 Many things can pull us down 
 But by grace and love, 
 You've forgiven me 
 And by grace and love, 
 We are free

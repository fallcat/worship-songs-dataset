You've dealt me every card I have played, 
 But I know I'm guilty of choices I've made 
 This is not the mystery that's constantly consuming me 
 It's How a God so Holy could love someone like me 
 No matter where I go Your mercy follows 
 And I come running back to You 
 Your Gravity keeps pulling me to You 
 I must have been destined for You 
 You knew this human heart would be lost 
 So You planned a ransom and You paid the cost 
 There's more beyond my mind that I can't see but I believe, 
 Because You are the only God who died for me 
 No matter where I go Your mercy follows 
 And I come running back to You

There are times I stumble 
 And I'm up against the wall 
 I can't walk through this life on my own 
 Holding onto nothing 
 And searching for more 
 I don't need anything else in this world 
 You say that you love me always and forever 
 You say that you love me and I know I will never 
 Deserve all the love that you show 
 It's the light that is guiding me home 
 I feel stronger in Your presence 
 And safe in your hands 
 Even though I'm oceans away 
 I'll take the life you've given me 
 And I'll live it again 
 It's grace that defines who I am. 
 You say that you love me always and forever 
 You say that you love me and I know I will never 
 Deserve all the love that you show 
 It's the light that is guiding me home 
 I'm finding my way back to your shores 
 Where there's safety and shelter from the storms 
 And it's here that you're waiting for me 
 With another chance to... 
 Say that you love me always and forever 
 Say that you love me and I know I will never 
 Deserve all the love that you show 
 It's the light that is guiding me home 
 It's the light that is guiding me home

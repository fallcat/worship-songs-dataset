I'm looking down into the eyes of hopelessness 
 They're crying out to me 
 I see the pain 
 It's so much more than youth should know 
 It tears me apart 
 What can I do to change what I see 
 This vicious cycle must come to an end 
 Can't you see 
 We're crushing the hearts of the innocent 
 We're teaching them to fail 
 And how it breaks me to see how were living 
 And punishing the ones that need us to care 
 To see them hurting 
 Feels like knuckles to the back of my head 
 Where have the days gone 
 That a promise was forever 
 Families stuck together 
 We wonder why their generation struggles to get by 
 There's no one to help 
 What can I do to change what I see 
 This vicious cycle must come to an end

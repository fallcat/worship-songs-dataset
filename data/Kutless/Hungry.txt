Living for You 
 Living for You 
 Living for You 
 Hungry I come to You 
 For I know You satisfy 
 I am empty but I know 
 Your love does not run dry 
 So I wait for You 
 So I wait for You 
 I'm falling on my knees 
 Offering all of me 
 Jesus You're all 
 This heart is living for 
 Broken I run to You 
 For Your arms are open wide 
 I am weary but I know Your touch 
 Restores my life 
 So I wait for You 
 So I wait for You 
 I'm falling 
 I'm falling for You 
 Jesus You're all 
 This heart is living for 
 I'm living for you

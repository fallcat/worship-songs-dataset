I look around and I feel like, thing's changed and I don't know why 
 And everyday that passes by I feel so far away 
 I can see in the distance, You have the rest of me 
 I put my trust in you, as I look beyond today 
 It's all becoming clear. 
 I do not belong in a world of broken pieces 
 I was meant to be in the arms of Your redemption 
 I am moving on to the place of Your perfection 
 'Cause I do not belong 
 When the world is behind me on the day that I breathe my last 
 In the face of enternity there's hope cause' I believe 
 When I look to the heavens and the future that you hold 
 It makes it easier to see beyond today 
 Now I'm looking to the sky 
 I do not belong in a world of broken pieces 
 I was meant to be in the arms of Your redemption 
 I am moving on to the place of Your perfection 
 'Cause I do not belong 
 This world is not my home 
 I'm a stranger in this land 
 But I am not alone 
 When I do not belong... 
 I do not belong in a world of broken pieces 
 I was meant to be in the arms of Your redemption 
 I am moving on to the place of Your perfection 
 'Cause I do not belong 
 No, I do not belong 
 I do not belong

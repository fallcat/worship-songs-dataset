I lift my eyes up 
 Unto the mountains 
 Where does my help come from? 
 My help comes from You 
 Maker of Heaven 
 Creator of the Earth 
 Oh how I need You, Lord 
 You are my only hope 
 You're my only prayer 
 So I will wait for You 
 To come and rescue me 
 Come and give me life 
 I lift my eyes up 
 Unto the mountains 
 Where does my help come from? 
 My help comes from You 
 Maker of Heaven 
 Creator of the earth 
 Oh how I need You, Lord 
 You are my only hope 
 You're my only prayer 
 So I will wait for You 
 To come and rescue me 
 Come and give me life 
 I lift my eyes up 
 Unto the mountains 
 Where does my help come from? 
 Oh how I need You, Lord 
 You are my only hope 
 You're my only prayer 
 So I will wait for You 
 To come and rescue me 
 Come and give me life 
 Oh how I need You, Lord 
 You are my only hope 
 You're my only prayer 
 So I will wait for You 
 To come and rescue me 
 Come and give me life

Life has a way of changing 
 And I can't deny that it's time 
 To let go of the safe and familiar 
 And leave all I've known far behind 
 So hold me close, don't let me fall 
 It's a chance to prove, Jesus I trust in You 
 Stepping out into the water 
 Walking into the unknown 
 I can't just stay here forever 
 Wherever You lead I will go 
 I will go with You 
 This is a day for new dreams 
 A time for my faith to be strong 
 My heart's finding peace in the chaos 
 I'm ready at last to move on 
 Stepping out into the water 
 Walking into the unknown 
 I can't just stay here forever 
 Wherever You lead I will go 
 I will go with You 
 I might stand in a storm 
 But I can't deny, there's no safer place than by Your side 
 Draw me close to You, draw me close to You 
 Stepping out into the water 
 Walking into the unknown 
 I can't just stay here forever 
 Wherever You lead I will go 
 I will go with You 
 Stepping out into the water 
 Walking into the unknown 
 I can't just stay here forever 
 Wherever You lead I will go 
 I will go with You 
 I will go with You 
 I will go with You

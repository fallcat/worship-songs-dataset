If You washed away my vanity 
 If You took away my words 
 If all my world was swept away 
 Would You be enough for me? 
 Would my beating heart still sing? 
 If I lost it all, would my hands stay lifted 
 To the God who gives and takes away? 
 If You take it all, this life You've given 
 Still my heart will sing to You 
 When my life is not what I expected 
 The plans I made have failed 
 When there's nothing left to steal me away 
 Will You be enough for me? 
 Will my broken heart still sing? 
 If I lost it all, would my hands stay lifted 
 To the God who gives and takes away? 
 If You take it all, this life You've given 
 Still my heart will sing to You 
 Even if You take it all away 
 You'll never let me go 
 You take it all away and I still know 
 That I'm Yours, I'm still Yours 
 Oh, I'm Yours, I'm still Yours 
 I'm still Yours

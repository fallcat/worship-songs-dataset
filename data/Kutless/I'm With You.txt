Here am I 
 I've tried to live without You 
 It's the reason that I feel so far away 
 I understand 
 You see everything I go through 
 And listen to the broken words I pray 
 I know You hear me 
 I know You're answering me saying 
 Fall in my arms and let me carry you carry you 
 I know you and I, we can make it through make it through 
 When crashing waves pull you down in the undertow 
 Reach out your hand and I swear I won't let you go 
 I'm with you tonight 
 All this time You've been walking here beside me 
 Waiting for the day I'd call your name 
 So Here am I walking through the darkest valley 
 Shine down Your light so I can see 
 You know I'm weary 
 I know You're calling out to me 
 Fall in my arms I will carry you 
 I know you and I will make it through 
 All who need rest all who are lonely 
 Come to me now and just let it go

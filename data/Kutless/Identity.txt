I've been looking from the outside, outside 
 I've been walking on a straight line, straight line 
 Scared to let the world see my failures, who I am, or who I've been 
 I've been waiting for somebody else to 
 Take the chance that I am so afraid to 
 I don't know how to and myself am I the only one the only one 
 Oh I wanna feel You move me like a river running through me 
 I am so tired of trying to 
 Prove it I m never gonna do it alone 
 God I need You to be my identity 
 It's always easier to hide behind that 
 Camouflage that keeps our hearts so guarded 
 But there's no shame when we surrender everything to You 
 Everything to You 
 I want to see the world change, see the system cave in 
 You pull our hearts from the ashes 
 The cry of the captive is rising 
 Oh I wanna feel You move me like a river running through me 
 I am so tired of trying to 
 Prove it I'm never gonna do it alone 
 God I need You to be my identity

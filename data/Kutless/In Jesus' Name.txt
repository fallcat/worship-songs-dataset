Hope for all the world, You came down, 
 Traded heaven's throne for a sinner's crown, 
 Grace poured out. 
 Son of righteousness crucified, 
 Hanging on the cross You paid the price, 
 To give us life 
 In Jesus' name our sins are washed away, 
 In Jesus' name we are rescued, we are saved, 
 For love has come to make a way for us, 
 In Jesus' name there is freedom for the broken, 
 In Jesus' name there is healing for the hopeless, 
 For all our days, we rest in Jesus' name 
 You alone are good forever true, 
 Never far away, we're holding on to You, 
 Only You 
 In Jesus' name our sins are washed away, 
 In Jesus' name we are rescued, we are saved, 
 For love has come to make a way for us, 
 In Jesus' name there is freedom for the broken, 
 In Jesus' name there is healing for the hopeless, 
 For all our days, we rest in Jesus' name 
 Holy, holy, You are worthy, 
 Hallelujah we are free. 
 We sing 
 Holy, holy, You are worthy, 
 Hallelujah we are free. 
 In Jesus' name our sins are washed away, 
 In Jesus' name we are rescued, we are saved, 
 For love has come to make a way for us, 
 In Jesus' name there is freedom for the broken, 
 In Jesus' name there is healing for the hopeless, 
 For all our days, we rest in Jesus' name 
 In Jesus' name

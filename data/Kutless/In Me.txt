Where were you last night when the party was on 
 Where were you when we all went down to the bar 
 It seems you have changed from us all 
 It seems you have changed 
 You want to know, the differences between us 
 You want to know, why these things have changed 
 You've got to know the One who lives in me 
 He lives in me, in me 
 Only seven days ago 
 I let go of my life yes I gave it all 
 I let go of all I used to do and gave it all away 
 You want to know, the differences between us 
 You want to know, why these things have changed 
 You've got to know the One who lives in me 
 He lives in me, in me 
 He lives in me, in me He lives... 
 You want to know, the differences between us 
 You want to know, why these things have changed 
 You've got to know the One who lives in me 
 He lives in me, in me 
 In me, in me

Bless this city in Jesus' name 
 Let Your healing fall like rain 
 God You gave us everything 
 May Your church do more than sing 
 Bless this city in Jesus' name 
 Wake up every heart You've changed 
 Help us be Your hands and feet 
 May Your love flood every street 
 Father, make us one 
 Let Your kingdom come in the city 
 Glorify Your Son 
 Let Your will be done in the city 
 In the city 
 Bless this city in Jesus' name 
 Tear down walls we've built in vain 
 Let our kingdoms be replaced 
 With unity that shows Your face 
 Father, make us one 
 Let Your kingdom come in the city 
 Glorify Your Son 
 Let Your will be done in the city 
 In the city 
 In the city 
 Father, make us one 
 Let Your kingdom come in the city 
 Glorify Your Son 
 Let Your will be done in the city 
 In the city 
 Bless this city in Jesus' name 
 Let Your healing fall like rain 
 God You gave us everything 
 May Your church do more than sing

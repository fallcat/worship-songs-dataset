It came upon the midnight clear 
 That glorious song of old 
 From angels bending near the earth 
 To touch their harps of gold 
 Peace on the earth, goodwill to men 
 From heavens all gracious king 
 The world in solemn stillness lay 
 To hear the angels sing 
 Still through the cloven skies they come 
 With peaceful wings unfurled 
 And still their heavenly music floats 
 O'er all the weary world 
 Above it's sad and lowly plains 
 They bend on hovering wing 
 And ever o'er its Babel sounds 
 The blessed angels sing 
 O, ye beneath life's crushing load 
 Whose forms are bending low 
 Who toil along the climbing way 
 With painful steps and slow 
 Look now for glad and golden hours 
 Come swiftly on the wing 
 Oh, rest beside the weary road 
 And hear the angels sing

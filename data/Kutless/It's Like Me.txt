My conversation is leading nowhere 
 And we talk of God but still I don't share 
 So many times that I just never saw the chance 
 It's like me to never see 
 When it came, When it went 
 Now it's gone away 
 It's so like me to never see 
 When it came, when it went 
 Now it's gone away 
 The phone rings with news that he's gone 
 Just the time I shared my heart was prepared 
 And another soul was won 
 So much truth to tell, I am so glad I saw the chance 
 Sometimes I still never see 
 When perfect opportunities come my way 
 Would my care increase if I truly believed 
 That a life could be saved?

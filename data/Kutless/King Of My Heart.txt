Let the King of my heart 
 Be the mountain where I run 
 The fountain I drink from 
 Oh, He is my song 
 Let the King of my heart 
 Be the shadow where I hide 
 The ransom for my life 
 Oh, He is my song 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 Let the King of my heart 
 Be the wind inside my sails 
 The anchor in the waves 
 Oh, He is my song 
 Let the King of my heart 
 Be the fire inside my veins 
 The echo of my days 
 Oh, He is my song 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 Yes, You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You're never gonna let 
 Never gonna let me down 
 You're never gonna let 
 Never gonna let me down 
 You're never gonna let 
 Never gonna let me down 
 You're never gonna let 
 Never gonna let me down 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 (When the night is holding on to me) 
 You are good, good, oh 
 (You are holding on) 
 You are good, good, oh 
 (When the night is holding on to me) 
 You are good, good, oh 
 (You are holding on) 
 You are good, good, oh 
 You are good, good, oh 
 When the night is holding on to me 
 God is holding on 
 When the night is holding on to me 
 God is holding on

Oh the memories 
 Of all the things that shouldn't be 
 They take you away from all you should be 
 Don't let it go by as if you agree 
 Nightmares of the past will fade away 
 The future of your name is what will stay 
 Never try to blame the past for everything you say 
 You have the power you need to change your legacy 
 Do you really want to be just like 
 The very ones you blame who take you away 
 From all you should be 
 Don't just stand by as if you agree 
 Think of the future and when you are gone 
 How will you be remembered then 
 For all time you can be the one who changed the name

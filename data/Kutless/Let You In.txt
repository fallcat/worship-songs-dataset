Lying here, in this pit 
 That life's pushed me down 
 I don't know just how long I can take 
 Or when I might break 
 I'm in, needing so someone 
 Please show me the truth 
 This need is real, in my soul I feel 
 The love you shared 
 That's why I can't say no again 
 My thoughts are confused 
 For my sins you're abused 
 My heart it screams 
 To open up and let you in 
 In my mind 
 I'm still fighting to understand 
 Nothing's free, but what You offered me 
 You give so freely 
 Though it cost You Your life and inside 
 You show me the truth 
 You know I try to do it 
 To be a self-made man 
 I tried to place it all 
 Upon my back again 
 But this crushing weight 
 Was well beneath the skin 
 Panicking for the light 
 An inner struggle I fight 
 But then I realized 
 That you could be the only way 
 Let you in...

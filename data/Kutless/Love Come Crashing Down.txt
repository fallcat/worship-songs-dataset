Let Your love come crashing down 
 Come and wreck this castle in the sand 
 Turn these walls I've built into rubble 
 God I need You need now, God I'm crying out 
 Let Your love come crashing down 
 Fall just like the rain washing over my heart 
 Mercy like a wave, there's power in the name of Jesus 
 Let Your love come crashing down 
 Build me up and teach me how to stand 
 On the solid rock that lasts forever 
 God I need You need now, God I'm crying out 
 Let Your love come crashing down 
 Fall just like the rain washing over my heart 
 Mercy like a wave, there's power in the name of Jesus 
 Jesus I know that I can trust Your heart 
 Even when my world is torn apart 
 Let Your love come crashing down 
 All I am is in Your hands 
 Let Your love come crashing down 
 Fall just like the rain washing over my heart 
 Mercy like a wave, there's power in the name of Jesus 
 Of Jesus, of Jesus, let Your love come crashing down

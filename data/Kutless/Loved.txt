I've tasted shame, I know regret 
 Still get it wrong, even at my best 
 Some days I stand, an inch from the edge 
 No way across, so lost 
 And loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul 
 I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home 
 So loved, by the One who chose to give up His life 
 I may never know how deep and how wide, I'm loved, I'm loved, oh 
 In spite of fear, it never ends 
 And hope can grow, no matter where I've been 
 I'm finding joy, in the middle of my pain 
 Surprising truth, that cannot be contained 
 I'm loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul 
 I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home 
 So loved, by the One who chose to give up His life 
 I may never know how deep and how wide, I'm loved 
 (I'm), nothing, nothing, nothing can separate us 
 (Not death, not life, no angel or demon), from His love, from His love 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing can separate us 
 (No depth, no height, nothing in all creation), from His love 
 I'm loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul 
 I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home 
 So loved, by the One who chose to give up His life 
 I may never know how deep and how wide 
 I'm loved, by the One who's seen the corners of my soul 
 Yes I'm loved, by the One who reaches out and calls me home 
 So loved, by the One who chose to give up His life 
 I may never know how deep and how wide 
 I may never know how deep and how wide, I'm loved

Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Will one day walk on water? 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Will save our sons and daughters? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Has come to make you new? 
 This child that you've delivered 
 Will soon deliver you 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Will give sight to a blind man? 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Will calm a storm with His hand? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Has walked where angels tried? 
 And when you kiss your little baby 
 You have kissed the face of God 
 The blind will see, the deaf will hear 
 And the dead will live again 
 The lame will leap, the dumb will speak 
 The praises of the Lamb 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Is Lord of all creation? 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Will one day rule the nations? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Is heaven's perfect Lamb? 
 This sleeping child you're holding 
 Is the great 'I am'

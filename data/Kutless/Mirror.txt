I could hold the pain inside, but my reflection 
 Reveals the shame of my disguise 
 Now I see there's nothing left to hide 
 As my deception dies, I'm not afraid 
 It's like looking in a mirror, I see You looking back at me 
 I know You're watching over me, I feel it when You speak to me 
 It couldn't be any clearer, I'm not going back 
 But now I see my destiny, I know who I'm meant to be 
 When I'm looking at the mirror, when I'm looking at the mirror 
 So now I step into the light, of Your perfection 
 I'm leaving everything behind 
 Your love has brought me back to life 
 From my affliction, now I'll never be afraid 
 It's like looking in a mirror, I see You looking back at me 
 I know You're watching over me, I feel it when You speak to me 
 It couldn't be any clearer, I'm not going back 
 But now I see my destiny, I know who I'm meant to be 
 When I'm looking at the mirror 
 I don't wanna forget this moment of clarity 
 When You opened up my eyes 
 I don't wanna forget this moment You spent with me 
 It's like looking in a mirror, I see You looking back at me 
 I know You're watching over me, I feel it when You speak to me 
 It couldn't be any clearer, I'm not going back 
 But now I see my destiny, I know who I'm meant to be 
 When I'm looking at the mirror, when I'm looking at the mirror 
 When I'm looking at the mirror, when I'm looking at the mirror 
 When I'm looking at the mirror

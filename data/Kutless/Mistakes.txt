Empty reasons for my past 
 Excuses do not hold 
 I'm struck with my affliction 
 An inner perfect storm 
 Why didn't someone warn me 
 To save me from myself 
 The pain is self-inflicted 
 The decisions were my own 
 Now listen to history 
 There's so much I could say 
 There's so much that I've learned 
 Don't make my mistake 
 There's no time to delay 
 Take my hand and learn from my heartache 
 Take a look into the past 
 See all the things I've tried 
 Looking for a truth inside 
 But only finding pain 
 See these deep and painful scars 
 Cutting to the bone 
 Do you want to look like me 
 With a broken empty life 
 Now listen to history 
 There's so much I could say 
 There's so much that I've learned 
 Don't make my mistake 
 There's no time to delay 
 Take my hand and learn from my heartache 
 Some things you may never understand 
 But knowledge from lessons not your own 
 Can save you from the unknown 
 Which may stop your fall 
 There's so much I could say 
 There's so much that I've learned 
 Don't make my mistake 
 There's no time to delay 
 Take my hand and learn from my heartache 
 There's so much I could say 
 There's so much that I've learned 
 Don't make my mistake 
 There's no time to delay 
 Take my hand and learn from my heartache

My heart is a ghost, faded and blurred 
 It used to be real with letters and words 
 Shadows and borders clouding my eyes 
 This light will grow dim holding onto the lies 
 I see you, I feel you, I know you're here 
 But I fear my heart is a ghost 
 I see you, I feel you, I know you're here 
 But I fear my heart is a ghost 
 So I silence the voices, swallow my pride 
 Hold onto what's real, throw darkness aside 
 Hold onto the promise, and fall to my knees 
 Forgiveness is freedom, it's all that I need 
 I see you, I feel you, I know you're here 
 But I fear my heart is a ghost 
 I see you, I feel you, I know you're here 
 But I fear my heart is a ghost 
 Will you take away all the fear and all the shame 
 Keep me running from everything that I've become 
 I see you, I feel you, I know you're here 
 But I fear my heart is a ghost 
 I see you, I feel you, I know you're here 
 But I fear my heart is a ghost

You tore the veil 
 So my eyes could see 
 Your open arms 
 Right in front of me 
 Lord I feel blind 
 Make this darkness flee 
 You know exactly 
 What I need 
 Help me God I do believe 
 But I feel lost and it's killing me 
 I need You right now. 
 God please answer me, 
 I know You're here but it's hard to see 
 I need You right now. 
 Trying myself 
 To figure it out 
 It's like standing on sand 
 And swimming in doubt 
 I know I'm not alone 
 If all of this time 
 You've been waiting 
 All of this time 
 For me to say it 
 Now I'm calling out. 
 Help me God I do believe 
 But I feel lost and it's killing me 
 I need You right now. 
 God please answer me, 
 I know You're here but it's hard to see 
 I need You right now. 
 You tore the veil 
 So my eyes could see 
 Your open arms 
 Right in front of me 
 Lord I feel blind 
 Make this darkness flee 
 You know exactly 
 What I need 
 It's You 
 It's You 
 It's You 
 Help me God I do believe 
 But I feel lost and it's killing me 
 I need You right now. 
 God please answer me, 
 I know You're here but it's hard to see 
 I need You right now. 
 You tore the veil 
 So my eyes could see 
 Your open arms 
 Right in front of me 
 You tore the veil 
 So my eyes could see 
 Your open arms 
 Right in front of me

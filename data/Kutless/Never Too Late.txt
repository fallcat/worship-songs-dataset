I see you staring at the sky 
 All of your regrets just running down your face 
 You think you finally crossed the line 
 Feel you sealed your fate 
 It's never too late, to call on Him 
 Whatever you've done, wherever you've been 
 All your mistakes are covered by grace 
 And as long as there's a breath left to take 
 It's never too late 
 It's hard to hide the pain of life 
 It's a losing game that you have played too long 
 You've listened to the voice of pride 
 It says you're too far gone, but believe me you're wrong 
 It's never too late, to call on Him 
 Whatever you've done, wherever you've been 
 All your mistakes are covered by grace 
 And as long as there's a breath left to take 
 It's never too late 
 To all who may be listening, it's never too late 
 To all who may be lost, there is peace, there is freedom and forgiveness 
 Waiting at the cross, waiting at the cross 
 It's never too late, to cry out to Him 
 Whatever you've done, wherever you've been 
 All your mistakes are covered by grace 
 And as long as there's a breath left to take 
 It's never too late 
 It's never too late 
 It's never too late (I see you staring at the sky) 
 It's never too late (You think you finally crossed the line) 
 It's never too late (It's never too late)

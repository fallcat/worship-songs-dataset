I see my savior 
 With love in His eyes 
 His body broken 
 With no sin to hide 
 I see my Jesus 
 Eyes blind with blood 
 His face is crimson 
 His cry is love 
 No wonder we call You Savior 
 No wonder we sing Your praise 
 Jesus, our hope forever 
 You made a way, You made a way 
 I see redemption 
 Ravage the grave 
 The triumph of Heaven 
 Christ Jesus our king 
 No wonder we call You Savior 
 No wonder we sing Your praise 
 Jesus, our hope forever 
 You made a way, You made a way 
 No wonder we call You Savior 
 No wonder we sing Your praise 
 Jesus, our hope forever 
 You made a way, You made a way 
 See the light tearing through the darkness 
 Hear the roar of the rugged cross 
 Jesus Christ, You alone have saved us 
 We worship You now 
 See the light tearing through the darkness 
 Hear the roar of the rugged cross 
 Jesus Christ, You alone have saved us 
 We worship You now 
 No wonder we call You Savior 
 No wonder we sing Your praise 
 Jesus, our hope forever 
 You made a way, You made a way 
 You made a way

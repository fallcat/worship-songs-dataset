You are the sky, waters lie underneath Your canopy 
 I felt a spark inside my heart ignite a burning symphony 
 Every moment I feel Your heartbeat, every moment I feel you move 
 All I see is a shadow, when all I want is to be right where You are 
 Holding on to forever, and the promise that Heaven's not too far 
 You are the sky, and I'm alive inside Your mystery 
 Infinite space and time collide inside Your perfect harmony 
 Every moment I feel Your heartbeat, every moment I feel you move 
 All I see is a shadow, when all I want is to be right where You are 
 Holding on to forever, and the promise that Heaven's not too far, not too far 
 I know that You're near to my heart and I'm safe in Your arms, Heaven's not too far 
 Every moment I feel Your heartbeat, every moment I feel you move 
 All I see is a shadow, when all I want is to be right where You are 
 Holding on to forever, and the promise that Heaven's not too far, not too far 
 Not too far, not too far

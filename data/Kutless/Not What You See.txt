Do you feel the tensions rise 
 Do you know why we always fight 
 To be better, better than you 
 And you better than me 
 'Cause I am not what you see, oh no 
 Not much more than a slave I wish to be 
 'Cause I am not what you see 
 Not much more a slave I should be 
 Nothing more a slave I will be 
 How could I ever think to be more 
 Than the One who created me 
 I watched Him do all that he said, His words were 
 "Be a servant to all" 
 'Cause I am not what you see, oh no 
 Not much more than a slave I wish to be 
 'Cause I am not what you see 
 Not much more a slave I should be 
 Nothing more a slave I will be 
 Only one deserves this exaltation 
 Only one deserves this elevation 
 But even He, He laid it down to serve on bended knee 
 'Cause I am not what you see, oh no 
 Not much more than a slave only I wish to be 
 'Cause I am not what you see 
 Not much more a slave I should be 
 'Cause I am not what you see, oh no 
 Not much more than a slave only I wish to be 
 'Cause I am not what you see 
 Not much more a slave I should be 
 Nothing more, a slave I will be

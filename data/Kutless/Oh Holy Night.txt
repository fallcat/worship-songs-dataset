O holy night, 
 The stars are brightly shining; 
 It is the night of 
 Our dear Savior's birth! 
 Long lay the world 
 In sin and error pining, 
 Till He appeared 
 And the soul felt its worth. 
 A thrill of hope, 
 The weary world rejoices, 
 For yonder breaks 
 A new and glorious morn. 
 Fall on your knees, 
 O hear the angel voices! 
 O night divine, 
 O night when Christ was born! 
 O night divine, O night, 
 O night divine!

You can't see a way, then a mountain moves 
 Skies are lonely gray, then the sun breaks through 
 When your darkest hour surrenders to the dawn 
 No where left to turn, but the sea will part 
 Running out of hope, still He holds your heart 
 And He won't let go, He's with you through it all 
 His love will overcome, overcome 
 His love has already won, already won 
 Will you take a stand, and a step of faith 
 Will you trust the hands, that calm the waves 
 You don't have to ever be afraid, He is with you through it all 
 His love will overcome, overcome 
 His love has already won, already won 
 I know that His love will overcome, whoa His love will overcome 
 I know that His love will overcome, yeah His love will overcome 
 Deep and wide an endless tide from age to age 
 Stronger than whatever we will face 
 I know that His love will overcome, whoa His love will overcome 
 We know that the war's already won, yeah His love will overcome 
 His love will overcome, overcome 
 His love has already won, already won 
 I know that His love will overcome, whoa His love will overcome 
 We know that the war's already won, yeah His love will overcome

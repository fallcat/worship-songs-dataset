Some say it's crazy 
 That you'd stay here by my side 
 I don't want to spend a day 
 Without you in my life 
 Maybe I'm a dreamer 
 And it seems that I'm lost within my mind 
 Searching for the moment dreams and destiny collide 
 I just need you to love me 
 I can't stop you from overcoming me 
 It's brought me to my knees 
 I don't want you letting go of me 
 I'm standing in the pouring rain 
 I can't believe you'd do the same 
 I can't stop you from overcoming me 
 I am not deserving 
 Of the way you see me in your eyes 
 You take me for who I am 
 I guess I wonder why 
 Maybe reassuring 
 Is all I can do in the meantime 
 And none of this can change the fact that lately 
 I've needed you around 
 I just need you to love me 
 I can't stop you from overcoming me 
 It's brought me to my knees 
 I don't want you letting go of me 
 I'm standing in the pouring rain 
 I can't believe you'd do the same 
 I can't stop you from overcoming me 
 I can't stop you from overcoming me 
 It's brought me to my knees 
 I don't want you letting go of me 
 I'm standing in the pouring rain 
 I can't believe you'd do the same 
 I can't stop you from overcoming me

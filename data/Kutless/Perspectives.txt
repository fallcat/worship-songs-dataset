It feels like your life's crashing 
 Down all around you 
 Let me ask if it's really so bad 
 Look at the world in its suffering 
 Can you honestly tell me 
 That no one else could understand 
 All of the hurting inside? 
 Why can't you see that freedom 
 Is sometimes simply another perspective away? 
 Who could you be if your lens was changed for a moment? 
 Would you still be the same? 
 A young child looks through a great stained-glass window 
 Watching the people go by 
 Everyone seems to be wearing a red coat 
 His mother sees jackets in white 
 Now he can't understand why does she see it this way 
 Yesterday, you really couldn't see 
 By changing your angle a new world would be 
 Revealed to your once-blinded eyes by moving a few degrees

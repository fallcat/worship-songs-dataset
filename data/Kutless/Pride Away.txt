Have you ever seen a man stumbled and fallen 
 All due to his pride 
 I don't want to be another one 
 Fallen due to my pride 
 Take my pride away 
 Pride away 
 Take my pride away 
 Pride away 
 Take my pride away 
 Lord keep me only focused on You 
 Make me a humble man 
 Don't ever let me take the credit 
 For all that you have done 
 Take my pride away 
 Pride away 
 Take my pride away 
 Pride away 
 Take my pride away 
 Standing here amidst this point of definition 
 Pushing for position as I battle opposition 
 Am I on a mission or is it all in vain 
 Do you notice the difference or is it all the same 
 And who do I blame when my vision gets blurry I 
 Get in a hurry frusterated and feeling fury 
 Faith is enduring to stand the test of time 
 Answers are plain we make them hard to define 
 But pull from divine when problems arise 
 But pride denies and my stand never survives 
 In every one of our lives in every single day 
 We need to lay down our pride as God takes it away 
 Take my pride away 
 Pride away 
 Take my pride away 
 Pride away 
 Take my pride away

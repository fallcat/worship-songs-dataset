I have fallen to my knees 
 As I sing a lullaby of pain 
 I'm feeling broken in my melody 
 As I sing to help the tears go away 
 Then I remember the pledge you made to me 
 I know you're always there 
 To hear my every prayer inside 
 I'm clinging to the promise of a lifetime 
 I hear the words you say 
 To never walk away from me and leave behind 
 The promise of a lifetime 
 Will you help me fall apart 
 Pick me up, take me in your arms 
 Find my way back from the storm 
 And you show me how to grow 
 Through the change 
 I still remember the pledge you made to me 
 I am holding on to the hope I have inside 
 With you I will stay through every day 
 Putting my understanding aside 
 And I am comforted

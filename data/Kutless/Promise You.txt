Tears wash the blood off of my face 
 Why did it have to be this way 
 I've taken the last beating from you 
 This I promise you 
 I'm waiting for the sun to rise 
 And make the darkness go away 
 The time has come to say goodbye 
 And God will help me find a way 
 Just to let go of the fear 
 I can't deny these thoughts of hate 
 The poison adding to my shame 
 Forgiveness can't take scars away 
 But I forgive you anyway 
 I'm waiting for the sun to rise 
 And make the darkness go away 
 The time has come to say goodbye 
 And God will help me find a way 
 Just to let go of the fear 
 I had enough 
 I took too much 
 But this I swear I will pray for you 
 I had enough 
 I took too much 
 But this I swear I will pray for you 
 I'm waiting for the sun to rise 
 And make the darkness go away 
 The time has come to say goodbye 
 And God will help me find a way 
 I'm waiting for the sun to rise 
 And make the darkness go away 
 The time has come to say goodbye 
 And God will help me find my way 
 As I let go of the fear

You tell me its nothing 
 But I see its something in your eyes 
 A fear is there 
 You say you don't need me 
 Don't try to deceive me 
 By pulling the wool over my eyes 
 There's nothing wrong with needing help sometimes 
 What are friendships for 
 Now please 
 Don't push me away 
 Condemn your pride 
 Sometimes we all need a hand to get by 
 Don't push me away 
 Condemn your pride 
 When tears start to fall then with you I will cry 
 No one is perfect 
 It just isn't worth it 
 To stand on your own 
 Though fear is there 
 Don't be ashamed to ask me to help you 
 To deal with the thoughts 
 Spinning your head 
 There's nothing wrong with needing help sometimes 
 What are friendships for 
 Now please 
 You can lean on me 
 Stand by my side 
 We will fight 
 We are much stronger as one

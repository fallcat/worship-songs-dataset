Oh Lord, you're beautiful 
 Your face is all I see 
 And when Your eyes, 
 Are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 There is a redeemer, 
 Jesus God's own Son 
 Precious Lamb of God Messiah 
 Holy One 
 Thank You oh my Father 
 For giving us Your Son 
 And leaving Your Spirit till 
 The work on earth is done 
 Thank You oh my Father 
 For giving us Your Son 
 And leaving Your Spirit till 
 The work on earth is done 
 Hallelujah...

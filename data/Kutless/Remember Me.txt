I looked in Your eyes and saw it for a moment 
 The passion in Your cry, the chains of life are broken 
 Put to death by Your people, You came to bring us life 
 Only hope for the hopeless, will You remember me? 
 I've been ashamed, I've been put down 
 Head in my hands, my life on the ground 
 Left Heaven to save liars and thieves 
 Sinners like me, Your blood sets us free 
 Who am I that You would remember me? 
 Spent all of my years stealing from the world 
 With everything I had yet I was still so poor 
 You have everything to lose, but You're dying here with me 
 I believe, I believe, will You remember me? 
 I've been ashamed, I've been put down 
 Head in my hands, my life on the ground 
 Left Heaven to save liars and thieves 
 Sinners like me, Your blood sets us free 
 Who am I? 
 Take what I have left, my Savior 
 Take me with You from this cross 
 When I leave this life completely 
 Remember me 
 I've been ashamed, and I've been put down 
 Head in my hands, my life on the ground 
 Left Heaven to save liars and thieves 
 Sinners like me, Your blood sets us free 
 I've been ashamed, and I've been put down 
 Head in my hands, my life on the ground 
 Left Heaven to save liars and thieves 
 Sinners like me, Your blood sets us free 
 Who am I that You would remember me?

You're my firm foundation, You're my rock 
 You're my great salvation when every hope is lost 
 You're my strong redeemer, You're my friend 
 By Your blood You saved my soul 
 I put my trust in You, my strong deliverer 
 I trust in You, my God 
 I put my hope in You, You reign forever 
 My heart will rest in You 
 You are all I need, You gave me life 
 Healed my broken soul by Your sacrifice 
 You were crucified but You're alive 
 Now I sing in victory 
 I put my trust in You, my strong deliverer 
 I trust in You, my God 
 I put my hope in You, You reign forever 
 My heart will rest in You 
 I will not fear, for You are on the throne 
 Through every storm, You're not letting go 
 You are good, You are good, God, You're so good 
 So I will rest in You 
 I put my trust in You, my strong deliverer 
 I trust in You, my God 
 I put my hope in You, You reign forever 
 My heart will rest in You 
 I put my trust in You, my strong deliverer 
 I trust in You, my God 
 I put my hope in You, You reign forever 
 My heart will rest in You 
 My heart will rest

Search my heart my every thought, 
 Shine the light of truth on every part, 
 Let me see myself through who You are, 
 Where else can I go, 
 Only You can make me whole. 
 Restore me, pull me out of darkness, for Your glory, 
 Let the waves of mercy wash over me, holy, holy, 
 Holy, I wanna see the fullness of Your majesty, 
 The beauty in the scars You're wearing for me, 
 Jesus, please restore me 
 Broken now I'm at Your feet, 
 Cause without Your love I'm incomplete, 
 You're my only hope to be set free, 
 Where else can I go, 
 Only you can make me whole. 
 Restore me, pull me out of darkness, for Your glory, 
 Let the waves of mercy wash over me, holy, holy, 
 Holy, I wanna see the fullness of Your majesty, 
 The beauty in the scars You're wearing for me, 
 Jesus, please restore me 
 By Your wounds we are healed, in Your death You revealed perfect love, 
 By Your grace we are saved, freedom's price has been paid, 
 Through sacrifice You gave us life, 
 Now from the grave we can rise. 
 Restore me, pull me out of darkness, for Your glory, 
 Let the waves of mercy wash over me, holy, holy, 
 Holy, I wanna see the fullness of Your majesty, 
 The beauty in the scars You're wearing for me, 
 Jesus, please 
 Restore me, pull me out of darkness, for Your glory, 
 Let the waves of mercy wash over me, holy, holy, 
 Holy, I wanna see the fullness of Your majesty, 
 The beauty in the scars You're wearing for me, 
 Jesus please restore me, 
 Please restore me, 
 Restore me, 
 Jesus, please restore me

Lord, we come before Your throne, 
 We lay our crowns of gold down at Your feet. 
 Lord, we stand and we will sing, 
 Behold the Lamb, by His blood we are redeemed 
 You are holy, great and mighty, 
 Who was and who is to come, 
 You are worthy, surrounded in glory, 
 All honor and power are Yours. 
 Face to face before our King, 
 As saints and angels join to bring You praise, 
 On that day there'll be no more pain, 
 For You, oh Lord, will wipe all our tears away 
 You are holy, great and mighty, 
 Who was and who is to come, 
 You are worthy, surrounded in glory, 
 All honor and power are Yours. 
 The lightning flashes, the thunder rolls, 
 Every nation gathers, before your throne, 
 As the lightning flashes, the thunder rolls, 
 Every nation gathers, before your throne. 
 You are holy, great and mighty, 
 Who was and who is to come, 
 You are worthy, surrounded in glory, 
 All honor and power are Yours. 
 You are holy, great and mighty, 
 Who was and who is to come, 
 You are worthy, surrounded in glory, 
 All honor and power are Yours. 
 All power is Yours 
 All honor is Yours 
 The power is Yours

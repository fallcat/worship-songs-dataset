Why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know I 
 Just, just want to be with you, to be with you 
 Looking down from above as you watch TV 
 Wondering why, oh you're ignoring me 
 Do you remember, remember when I came to you 
 And you loved me 
 And I'm waiting for you 
 And I'm waiting for you 
 Why do you run, why do you hide oh, don't you know I 
 Just, just wanna be with you, to be with you 
 Hey, why do you run, why do you hide oh, don't you know 
 I just, just wanna be with you, to be with you... 
 Whatever happened to the love, the love you had for me 
 When you first came to me 
 Don't you know that I died, died so I could be with you 
 Forever 
 And I'm waiting for you 
 And I'm waiting for you 
 Why do you run, why do you hide oh, don't you know I 
 Just, just wanna be with you, to be with you 
 Hey, why do you run, why do you hide oh, don't you know 
 I just, just wanna be with you, to be with you... 
 Find a place of solitude, and I'll speak to you 
 As you pray to me 
 Don't you know I'm waiting here, waiting for you to 
 Read and hear my words 
 I'm waiting here missing the time the times we shared 
 Oh, please come to me 
 Why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know I 
 Just, just wanna be with you, to be with you 
 Hey, why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know 
 I just, just wanna be with you, to be with you...

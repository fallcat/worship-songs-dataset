You ask me why I need this faith 
 I tell you now it's the only way 
 To be set free from all your pain 
 You must accept these words I say 
 I need your focus just this day 
 Let me reveal to you a friend 
 He'll give you purpose and eternal life 
 He is the Christ and to Him I say 
 I know that You are the only way 
 To be saved from my infirmity 
 You shed Your blood 
 You gave Your love away 
 Oh all to cover me 
 I tell you now that He is the way 
 Jesus You ransomed my frailty 
 Yes I found I know He is the truth 
 The truth the life and the way 
 The way 
 I know that You are the only way 
 To be saved from my infirmity 
 You shed Your blood 
 You gave Your love away 
 Oh all to cover me 
 I cry out to You 
 With the love that fills my heart 
 I give my life to You 
 In faith I won't depart 
 Oh now won't you come and take Him in 
 He'll be more than you could ever dream 
 It's Jesus Christ in Him we trust 
 He is the truth the life and the way 
 The way, the way, the way 
 To be saved 
 I know that You are the only way 
 To be saved from my infirmity 
 You shed Your blood 
 You gave Your love away 
 Oh all to cover me 
 I cry out to You 
 With the love that fills my heart 
 I give my life to You 
 In faith I won't depart 
 I know it'll be all right, okay

I see the city lights all around me 
 Everyone's obscure 
 Ten million people each with their problems 
 Why should anyone care? 
 And in your eyes I can see... 
 I am not just a man vastly lost in this world 
 Lost in a sea of faces 
 Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine 
 Because You traded Your life for mine 
 Sometimes my life it feels so trivial 
 Immersed in the greatness of space 
 Yet somehow You still find the time for me 
 It's then You show me Your love 
 And in your eyes I can see... 
 And in your arms I will be... 
 I am not just a man vastly lost in this world 
 Lost in a sea of faces 
 Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine 
 Because You traded Your life for mine 
 If only my one heart 
 Was all You'd gain from all it cost 
 Well I know You would have 
 Still been a man with a reason 
 To willingly offer your life 
 I am not just a man vastly lost in this world 
 Lost in a sea of faces 
 Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine 
 Because You traded Your life for mine 
 Just one in a million faces

Nothing shall I want, nothing shall I fear 
 Lord, I know that You are near 
 You can make me still, You restore my soul 
 Lord, I know that You are near 
 Shepherd of my soul 
 You will never let me go 
 Because of You 
 Because of who You are! 
 In the valley low 
 There's no fear that I'm alone 
 Because of You 
 Because of who You are! 
 Lead us in the path of Your righteousness 
 For the sake of Your great name 
 You prepare a place where I'm forever safe 
 Your mercy finds me all my days 
 Shepherd of my soul 
 You will never let me go 
 Because of You 
 Because of who You are! 
 In the valley low 
 There's no fear that I'm alone 
 Because of You 
 Because of who You are! 
 Your love, it leads us home 
 Yes, Your love, leads us home 
 Jesus, Your love, it leads us home 
 Oh, Jesus, Your love, leads us home 
 Your love, it leads us home 
 Jesus, Your love, it leads us home! 
 You're the Shepherd of my soul 
 Only One I will follow 
 Because of You 
 Because of who You are! 
 In the valley low 
 There's no fear that I'm alone 
 Because of You 
 Because of who You are!

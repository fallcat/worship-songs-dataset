Tell me something I don't already know 
 I know that you can't stand these things 
 I'm preaching in the streets 
 But how can I contain the truth I hold inside 
 With all the hurting people that I see so I don't mind 
 Putting up with you, and all the things you say 
 I'm not about to stop or even change my ways 
 There's nothing you can say 
 That will take me away from this life 
 There's nothing you can do 
 To shut me up (to shut me out) when I'm speaking the truth 
 You may not like all I have to say 
 But you can't prove that everything 
 Is filled with empty words 
 I know my life and inside how I've changed 
 A testimony to the truth I speak, so I don't mind 
 Putting up with you, and all the things you say 
 I'm not about to stop or even change my ways

Another beautiful morning 
 The sun seems a little brighter today 
 It's my reward for stepping into the moment 
 As I am seizing the day 
 I'm soaring now somewhere in the sky 
 The rush of air never wanting to come down 
 There's nothing that I've ever felt like 
 Learning how to fly 
 I'm learning how to fly 
 The freedom to be in the moment 
 The reason for making a memory 
 Never wasting all that comes my way 
 As I take what I see 
 I thank God for our freedom 
 There's nothing wrong with enjoying things in life 
 Spread the word that a smile's not beyond us 
 This is a call to act and seize your day

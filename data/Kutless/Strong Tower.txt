When I wander through the desert 
 And I'm longing for my home 
 All my dreams have gone astray 
 When I'm stranded in the valley 
 And I'm tired and all alone 
 It seems like I've lost my way 
 I go running to Your mountain 
 Where Your mercy sets me free 
 You are my strong tower 
 Shelter over me 
 Beautiful and mighty 
 Everlasting King 
 You are my strong tower 
 Fortress when I'm weak 
 Your name is true and holy 
 And Your face is all I seek 
 In the middle of my darkness 
 In the midst of all my fear 
 You're my refuge and my hope 
 When the storm of life is raging 
 And the thunder's all I hear 
 You speak softly to my soul 
 I go running to Your mountain 
 Where Your mercy sets me free 
 You are my strong tower 
 Shelter over me 
 Beautiful and mighty 
 Everlasting King 
 You are my strong tower 
 Fortress when I'm weak 
 Your name is true and holy 
 And Your face is all I seek 
 And Your face is all I seek 
 Yeah, Your face is all I seek 
 I go running to Your mountain 
 Where Your mercy sets me free 
 You are my strong tower 
 Shelter over me 
 Beautiful and mighty 
 Everlasting King 
 You are my strong tower 
 Fortress when I'm weak 
 Your name is true and holy 
 You are my strong tower 
 Shelter over me 
 Beautiful and mighty 
 Everlasting King 
 You are my strong tower 
 Fortress when I'm weak 
 Your name is true and holy 
 And Your face is all I seek

Take me past the outer courts 
 Into the holy place 
 Past the brazen altar 
 Lord I want to see Your face 
 Pass me by the crowds of people 
 And the priests who sing Your praise 
 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness 
 But it's only found in one place 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take me in by the blood of the Lamb 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am 
 Take me past the outer courts 
 Into the holy place 
 Past the brazen altar 
 Lord I want to see Your face 
 Pass me by the crowds of people 
 And the priests who sing Your praise 
 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness 
 And  it's only found in one place 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take me in by the blood of the Lamb 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am 
 Take me past the outer courts 
 Into the holy place 
 Past the brazen altar 
 Lord I want to see Your face 
 Pass me by the crowds of people 
 And the priests who sing Your praise 
 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness 
 And  it's only found in one place 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take me in by the blood of the Lamb 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take me in by the blood of the Lamb 
 Take me in to the holy of holies 
 Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am 
 Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am

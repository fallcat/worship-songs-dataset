The world will fade away as I lift my hands 
 The King is worthy of praise, is the great I am 
 The joy You've given rings out as I lift my voice 
 I'm captivated by Your ways, so I will worship You 
 You've taken me by love 
 You've taken me by grace 
 You've taken me away, I can't resist 
 Because You've taken my heart 
 All creation will bow to the risen King 
 All of heaven will shout and the earth will sing 
 The joy You've given rings out as I lift my voice 
 I'm captivated my Your ways so I will worship You 
 You've taken me by love 
 You've taken me by grace 
 You've taken me away, I can't resist 
 Because You've taken my heart 
 You've taken me by love 
 You've taken me by grace 
 You've taken me away, I can't resist 
 Because You've taken my heart 
 You've taken my heart 
 My heart, my heart 
 You've taken me by love 
 You've taken me by grace 
 You've taken me away, I can't resist 
 Because You've taken my heart 
 You've taken me by love 
 You've taken me by grace 
 You've taken me away, I can't resist 
 Because You've taken my heart 
 You've taken my heart 
 You've taken my heart 
 You've taken my heart 
 You've taken my heart

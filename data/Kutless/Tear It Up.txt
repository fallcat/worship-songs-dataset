I look around like I'm trying to find somebody else 
 But deep down I know I'm looking for myself 
 I thought I knew who I was and what I should be 
 But I found it's only a fraction of me 
 We gotta tear down so we can build back up 
 Never stop, never stop, until it's done 
 Gotta reset and find every flaw 
 Gonna become stronger than we were before 
 We're gonna tear it up till the sun goes down 
 We're gonna build back up on solid ground 
 We're gonna tear it up 
 I never thought everything could come to this 
 I never realized all of my weaknesses 
 But now I know that this is the only way 
 And now I'm finding my strength through all the pain 
 We gotta tear down so we can build back up 
 Never stop, never stop, until it's done 
 Gotta reset and find every flaw 
 Gonna become stronger than we were before 
 We're gonna tear it up till the sun goes down 
 We're gonna build back up on solid ground 
 We're gonna tear it up 
 I never fell this far, I'm broken underneath 
 It's all coming apart, I can hardly breathe 
 We're gonna tear it up 
 We're gonna tear it up 
 We're gonna tear it up 
 We're gonna tear it up till the sun goes down 
 We're gonna build back up on solid ground 
 We're gonna tear it up

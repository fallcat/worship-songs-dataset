I've been infected with the latest disease 
 An Epidemic that's infecting the weak 
 It doesn't matter how I plead 
 Because I can't escape it 
 It's my temptation 
 It's so contagious 
 There's something wrong with me 
 Inside I'm wanting to be free 
 But the more I give the more consuming it just seems to be 
 I know it's what I need 
 To find a cure for this disease 
 To save me from all of my self deprication 
 Is there way to clean the sin off of me 
 Is there anyone with a vaccine 
 I'll take the shot even if I bleed 
 As long as it can heal me 
 I will do whatever I need 
 To uncontaminate and then proceed 
 Is it too late to forgive and forget 
 Can someone help me 
 It's my temptation 
 It's so contagious 
 There's something wrong with me 
 Inside I'm wanting to be free 
 But the more I give the more consuming it just seems to be 
 I know it's what I need 
 To find a cure for this disease 
 To save me from all of my self deprication 
 There only is one cure 
 That is why I pray 
 Jesus please take it away 
 There's something wrong with me 
 Inside I'm wanting to be free 
 But the more I give the more consuming it just seems to be 
 I know it's what I need 
 To find a cure for this disease 
 To save me from all of my self deprecation

I feel like I can't stand still any more 
 Are you with me? 
 Got a mic, here's the band now get your feet off the floor 
 Can you hear me? 
 I cannot run away 
 The feeling's got to stay 
 While we rock all night long 
 I think that we all know 
 The reason that we show 
 The world how real we are 
 Turn it up, feel the beat, and scream the lyrics you know 
 Keep it coming 
 The time is right, let's unite to the rock and roll 
 Everybody 
 I cannot run away 
 The feeling's got to stay 
 While we rock all night long 
 I think that we all know 
 The reason that we show 
 The world how real we are 
 There's a greater meaning 
 Behind the music that we are bringing 
 Cause' tonight we are singing 
 And together we know 
 We cannot run away 
 The feeling's got to stay 
 While we rock all night long 
 I think that we all know 
 The reason that we show 
 The world how real we are

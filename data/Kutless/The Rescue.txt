I don't know what's happening 
 Everything around me has come crashing to the ground 
 It's here I see my need 
 In all the devastation 
 I'm praying for a miracle, help me to escape 
 Again 
 My life is a mass destruction 
 You're pulling me from the mess I'm in 
 You take me away 
 There's glass in the air I'm breathing 
 Somehow my heart keeps beating till 
 You take me away 
 Will you send an angel 
 A ray of sunlight shining through the darkness of my world 
 That's falling down on me 
 You are my salvation 
 The only one to rescue me from the torment that I'm in 
 Again 
 My life is a mass destruction 
 You're pulling me from the mess I'm in 
 You take me away 
 There's glass in the air I'm breathing 
 Somehow my heart keeps beating till 
 You take me away 
 Goodbye my hurting 
 Goodbye my needing 
 Goodbye my worries 
 Goodbye to all of my bleeding 
 My life is a mass destruction 
 You're pulling me from the mess I'm in 
 You take me away 
 There's glass in the air I'm breathing 
 Somehow my heart keeps beating till 
 You take me away

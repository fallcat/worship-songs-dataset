Do you find it hard to sleep tonight 
 Resting by the Christmas lights? 
 Could there be something you forgot? 
 Beyond the bows and mistletoe 
 The tree with presents wrapped below 
 There's more to this than you had ever thought 
 Have we lost the reason that we celebrate each year? 
 What is Christmas? 
 If there never was a savior wrapped in a manger 
 What is Christmas without Christ? 
 Remember how the story goes 
 God's gift was wrapped in swaddling clothes 
 Beneath the star, one great and holy night 
 The shepherds heard the angels sing 
 The wise man brought an offering 
 Peace on Earth began in Bethlehem 
 Have we lost the reason that we celebrate each year? 
 What is Christmas? 
 If there never was a savior wrapped in a manger 
 What is Christmas? 
 If the angels never sang 
 Glory to the new born king? 
 What is Christmas without Christ? 
 There'd be no Gloria 
 In excelsis deo 
 Gloria 
 In excelsis deo 
 What is Christmas? 
 (Joy to the world) 
 If there never was a savior wrapped in a manger 
 (Joy to the world) 
 What is Christmas without Christ? 
 This is Christmas 
 It's all about the savior wrapped in a manger 
 (Joy to the world) 
 This is Christmas because of Jesus Christ 
 (Gloria) 
 This is Christmas 
 (In excelsis deo) 
 Because of Christ 
 (In excelsis deo) 
 Because of Christ

Alone in a garden weeping 
 Begging his father pleading 
 Take this cup from me 
 But if it's your will father let it be 
 All of the others sleeping 
 Sweat on his brow was bleeding 
 He could have run away 
 But he chose to stay 
 This is love 
 This is real 
 This is more than a hope or a feeling 
 It's enough to cover us 
 This is love 
 After a kiss abandoned 
 Beaten and cursed for passion 
 They lifted him up to die 
 But he laid down his life 
 Death only wished it was stronger 
 The grave couldn't hold I'm longer 
 He rose in victory to rescue his enemies 
 This is love 
 This is real 
 This is more than a hope or a feeling 
 It's enough to cover us 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 This is real 
 This is more than a hope or a feeling 
 It's enough to cover us 
 This is love 
 It seems like this mercy 
 Is following me 
 It seems like this love 
 Has come to rescue me 
 It seems like this mercy 
 Is following me 
 Everywhere I go 
 It seems like this mercy 
 This is love 
 This is real 
 This is more than a hope or a feeling 
 It's enough to cover us 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 This is real 
 This is more than a hope or a feeling 
 It's enough to cover us 
 This is love 
 Love 
 It's enough to cover us 
 This is love

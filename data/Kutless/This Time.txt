I see you standing there 
 I see a tear in your eye 
 Why'd you turn away 
 Why'd you run 
 Run till this point of breaking 
 No walking away 
 No walking away 
 You were the one 
 That I looked to 
 I never thought 
 I'd see you run 
 I never thought I'd see you 
 Turn your back on 
 All you knew was right 
 You turned your back on God 
 No walking away 
 No walking away 
 No walking away 
 This time 
 No walking away 
 I see you're back again 
 You'll never run again 
 This time 
 No walking away 
 No walking away

(Will the situation bring you around?) 
 The black of night is closing in around you 
 The crippling fear moves in as they strap you down 
 Will you let a moment get the best of you? 
 Will this situation bring you around? 
 When the blood stains dry, will it bring you around? 
 Will it pass you by? 
 Right now, you're bruised and bleeding 
 I see the hurt within your eyes 
 I know your pain is for a reason 
 You need to feel just to know that You're alive 
 The days have turned to weeks but it's not over 
 The bandages rewind you to where you've been 
 These memories will remind you, when life takes you out, will it bring you around? 
 When it's said and done, will it bring you around? 
 What will you become? 
 Right now, you're bruised and bleeding 
 I see the hurt within your eyes 
 I know your pain is for a reason 
 You need to feel just to know that You're alive 
 Right now, you're bruised and bleeding 
 I see the hurt within your eyes 
 I know your pain is for a reason 
 You need to feel just to know that You're alive 
 You're alive, you're alive 
 Right now, you're bruised and bleeding 
 I see the hurt within your eyes 
 I know your pain is for a reason 
 You need to feel just to know that You're alive 
 Right now, you're bruised and bleeding 
 I see the hurt within your eyes 
 I know your pain is for a reason 
 You need to feel just to know that You're alive

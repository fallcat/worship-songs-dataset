I hear the voice 
 Of thousands 
 All gathered here 
 Are they just a noise 
 Soon lost in air 
 Or is there more 
 Is there more 
 You lift your hands up high 
 Reaching to the sky 
 Is there a reason 
 Can, can you tell me why 
 Or is there more 
 Is there more 
 So let me ask you 
 Can't you feel the music 
 All around you 
 Flashing lights 
 But love can fill your mind 
 Can't you feel the sounds 
 Of love flow through you 
 We're praising Him tonight 
 Can't you feel the music 
 All around you 
 Flashing lights 
 But love can fill your mind 
 Can't you feel the sounds 
 Of love flow through you 
 We're praising Him tonight 
 Some say that 
 It's, it's not right 
 For us to praise 
 On, on this type of night 
 Tonight there's more 
 There's more 
 Time tonight 
 Just more than empty words 
 The songs of love 
 Sent to our God above 
 Life is more 
 There's more 
 So let me ask you 
 Can't you feel the music 
 All around you 
 Flashing lights 
 But love can fill your mind 
 Can't you feel the sounds 
 Of love flow through you 
 We're praising Him tonight 
 Can't you feel the music 
 All around you 
 Flashing lights 
 But love can fill your mind 
 Can't you feel the sounds 
 Of love flow through you 
 We're praising Him tonight 
 Can't you feel the music 
 All around you 
 Flashing lights 
 But love can fill your mind 
 Can't you feel the sounds 
 Of love flow through you 
 We're praising Him tonight

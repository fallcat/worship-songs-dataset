It all starts here with my disgrace 
 I give you my life then I run in haste 
 In this false life something needs to give 
 Tell me a reason why this isn't a treason 
 Tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong 
 I swear I'm back but then it turns out it's only a season 
 So tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong 
 With my two lips I will praise your name 
 Then I turn around and only curse and blame 
 I give in, strength is thin, adding to my shame 
 Tell me a reason why this isn't a treason 
 Tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong 
 I swear I'm back but then it turns out it's only a season 
 So tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong 
 Your blood it covered all my sin 
 You changed a traitor into kin 
 In this false life something needs to give 
 Tell me a reason why this isn't a treason 
 Tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong 
 I swear I'm back but then it turns out it's only a season 
 So tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong 
 Tell me a reason why this isn't a treason 
 Tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong 
 I swear I'm back but then it turns out it's only a season 
 So tell me 
 Tell me I'm wrong

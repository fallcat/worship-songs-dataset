A screaming man falls to his knees 
 His broken heart inflicts the pain 
 He's withdrawn, no one knows his name 
 One mistake, now he's lost in shame 
 Amidst the pain, you're not alone 
 Though you can't see through the haze 
 His eyes of love are staring down 
 And He feels your troubled heart 
 Yes it's true, that someone cares 
 Your perfect friend, never leaving you 
 Strength is gone and you're feeling cold 
 You will know the truth that He told 
 Amidst the pain, you're not alone 
 Though you can't see through the haze 
 His eyes of love are staring down 
 And He feels your troubled heart 
 By Your grace you repair the broken pieces within 
 Somehow You take a man 
 And make something more out of him 
 Amidst the pain, you're not alone 
 Though you can't see through the haze 
 His eyes of love are staring down 
 And He feels your troubled heart

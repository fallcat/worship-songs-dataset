Another year has come and gone 
 Nothing's changed 
 I wasted another year 
 Doing the same old things 
 I want to break out of this 
 Turn my life around 
 I'm going to make a vow 
 To repent and turn to You 
 I'm crying out to You now 
 As I make my New Year's vow (My New Years Vow) 
 I'll tell You I love You 
 And I'll honor You somehow 
 Hear my promise to You in my New Year's vow 
 I give You all of me 
 You'll be all of my life 
 And I'll never think twice 
 To do all that You have for me 
 In my New Year's vow 
 Lord I'll do my best to do all that I say 
 I'm not perfect but I know it's okay 
 If I stumble You won't condemn my shame 
 I'm going to make a vow to repent and turn to You 
 I'm crying out to You now 
 As I make my New Year's vow (My New Years Vow) 
 I'll tell You I love You 
 And I'll honor You somehow 
 Hear my promise to You in my New Year's vow 
 I give You all of me 
 You'll be all of my life 
 And I'll never think twice 
 To do all that You have for me 
 In my New Year's vow 
 It's a new year this year is different 
 From the other ones 
 From the other ones 
 From the other ones 
 I'm crying out to you now 
 As I make my New Year's vow (My New Years Vow) 
 I'll tell You I love You 
 And I'll honor You somehow 
 Hear my promise to You in my New Year's vow 
 I give you all of me 
 You'll be all of my life 
 And I'll never think twice 
 To do all that You have for me 
 In my New Year's vow

I love you Lord 
 And I lift my voice 
 To worship You 
 Oh, my soul rejoice 
 Take joy my King 
 In what You hear 
 And let it be a sweet sweet 
 Sound in Your ear 
 I love you Lord 
 And I lift my hands 
 To worship You 
 As Your Word commands 
 Take joy my King 
 In what You see 
 May it be a pleasing sight 
 Unto Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 Oh, Lord 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 Oh, Lord 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 Oh, Lord 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 We exalt Thee 
 Oh, Lord

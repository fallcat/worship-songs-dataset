We fall down 
 We lay our crowns 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 The greatness of 
 Mercy and love 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 And we cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lamb 
 We fall down 
 We lay our crowns 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 The greatness of 
 Mercy and love 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 And we cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lamb 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lamb

Come all you heavy hearted, come all you weary ones 
 Hear what the grace of God has done 
 Come cast your cares upon Him, come lay your burdens down 
 Here in the place where peace is found 
 We lift You up, we lift You up 
 For Your great love 
 We lift You up, we lift You up 
 For Your great love 
 We were the heavy hearted, we were the weary ones 
 Until the grace of God's own Son 
 We cast our cares upon You, we lay our burdens down 
 Here in the place where peace is found 
 We lift You up, we lift You up 
 For Your great love 
 We lift You up, we lift You up 
 For Your great love 
 Every knee will bow before Your throne 
 Every tongue will confess that You are Lord 
 Every knee will bow before Your throne 
 Every tongue will confess that You are Lord 
 We lift You up, we lift You up 
 For Your great love 
 We lift You up, we lift You up 
 For Your great love

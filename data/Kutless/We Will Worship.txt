When days are gold and life is good 
 When the plans we make go as they should 
 Or when the sky turns dark and heartache falls 
 And a lonely painful season calls 
 We will worship with all of our hearts 
 We will worship all that You are 
 Through the best, through the worst 
 Jesus we choose, we will worship You 
 The only constant here is change 
 But You forever stay the same 
 No matter what this life holds in store 
 The truth remains, You are Lord 
 We will worship with all of our hearts 
 We will worship all that You are 
 Through the best, through the worst 
 Jesus we choose, we will worship You 
 You are high and lifted up, good in all Your ways 
 Glorious and worthy of all praise 
 You are high and lifted up, to You our voices raise 
 You're worthy of our praise 
 So we will worship with all of our hearts 
 We will worship all that You are 
 Through the best, through the worst 
 Jesus we choose 
 We will worship with all of our hearts 
 We will worship all that You are 
 Through the best, through the worst 
 Jesus we choose, we will worship You 
 We will worship You

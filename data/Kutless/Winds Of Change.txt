Can you feel the pains in life? 
 Wrapped around you like they're chains 
 Restricting all your dreams 
 Do you wonder if there is a way? 
 A way to set you free 
 Set you free 
 So tell me all your dreams 
 Tell me all your fears 
 And what you're longing for the most 
 It's not another way that'll end up the same 
 For it's under my control 
 Do you feel the winds of change 
 Soon this weight will fall away 
 And take you to a place 
 Only found through these winds of change 
 A breeze that's new and free 
 I'll be the one who you can cry to 
 The one who will give you wings 
 I will give wings 
 Someday we'll sail away 
 Mounted up on wings like eagles 
 We will run and will not fade away

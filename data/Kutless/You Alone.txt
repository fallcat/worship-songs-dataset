In Your hands 
 You hold every star 
 And You hold my heart 
 My beating heart 
 With Your voice 
 You created life 
 And opened up my eyes 
 My blinded eyes 
 There is one like You, no one 
 Great is the Lord 
 Ruler of all 
 You alone 
 Conquered the grave 
 You are the way 
 You alone 
 You alone 
 At the cross 
 You stretched out Your arms 
 Now You wear the scars 
 You wear the scars 
 At Your name 
 Every knee will bow 
 Every voice will shout 
 We will shout 
 There is one like You, no one 
 Great is the Lord 
 Ruler of all 
 You alone 
 Conquered the grave 
 You are the way 
 You alone 
 You alone 
 We lift our holy hands to You our Savior 
 Your love is shining through the dark 
 We wanna see Your kingdom 
 Reign forever 
 Jesus we worship who You are 
 There is one like You, no one 
 There is one like You, no one 
 There is one like You, no one 
 There is one like You, no one 
 Great is the Lord 
 Ruler of all 
 You alone 
 Conquered the grave 
 You are the way 
 You alone 
 Great is the Lord 
 Ruler of all 
 You alone 
 Conquered the grave 
 You are the way 
 You alone 
 Jesus, You alone

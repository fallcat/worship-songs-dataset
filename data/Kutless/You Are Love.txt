Sorrow, feeling the garden in the darkest night 
 Unfaithful, kiss of betrayal but you did not fight 
 So let his will be done at the greatest price 
 And you gave yourself as a sacrifice 
 You gave it all and it's all because 
 You are, you are love 
 You are, you are love 
 You gave your life for us, Jesus 
 You are, you are love 
 Whoa, whoa 
 You gave your life for us, Jesus 
 You are, you are love 
 The world's fate, all on your shoulder 
 The weight of all of our failures 
 You prayed, father forgive them 
 They know not what they've done 
 You gave it all and it's all because 
 You are, you are love 
 You are, you are love 
 You gave your life for us, Jesus 
 You are, you are love 
 Whoa, whoa 
 You gave your life for us, Jesus 
 You are, you are love 
 Let his will be done at the greatest price 
 You gave yourself as a sacrifice 
 Let his will be done at the greatest price 
 You gave yourself as a sacrifice 
 You are, you are love 
 You are, you are love 
 You are, you are love 
 You are, you are love 
 You gave your life for us, Jesus 
 You are, you are love 
 Whoa, whoa 
 You gave your life for us, Jesus 
 You are, you are love

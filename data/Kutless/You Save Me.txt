Time and time again I've gone running 
 Chasing after empty plans 
 That steal my heart away and leave me broken 
 My only hope is in Your hands 
 You save me, You set me free 
 Forever, Savior, You will rescue me 
 Forgiven, now I will sing 
 Forever, Savior, You will rescue me 
 I'll never be the same 
 Your love is changing everything 
 You pulled me from the grave 
 Wrapped me in Your arms 
 Jesus, You have won my heart 
 You save me, You set me free 
 Forever, Savior, You will rescue me 
 Forgiven, now I will sing 
 Forever, Savior, You will rescue me 
 Jesus, Messiah 
 You rescued me, You rescued me 
 Mighty Redeemer 
 You save me, You save me 
 You save me, You set me free 
 Forever, Savior, You will rescue me 
 Forgiven, now I will sing 
 Forever, Savior, You will rescue me

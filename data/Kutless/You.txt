Clouds rolling on moving shadows 
 Over the countryside 
 A ray of light descends from the heavens 
 You're presence fills the sky 
 I can't deny what I'm seeing is true 
 When all I can think of and all I can dream of is 
 You 
 You're the love I have always known 
 And It's You 
 I will never be alone 
 You're all I desire You're all that I choose 
 I guess that explains why I feel like I do 
 I cannot deny what I'm falling into 
 When all I can think of and all I can dream of is 
 You 
 The earth declares your glory 
 There's nowhere it can hide 
 And still you let me in 
 You draw me to your side 
 You are my hope and I know that it's true 
 When all I can think of and all I can dream of is You 
 You're the love I have always known 
 And It's You 
 I will never be alone 
 You're all I desire You're all that I choose 
 I guess that explains why I feel like I do 
 I cannot deny what I'm falling into 
 When all I can think of and all I can dream of is 
 You

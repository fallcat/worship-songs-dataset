There were walls between us 
 By the cross you came and broke them down 
 You broke them down 
 And there were chains around us 
 And by your grace we are no longer bound 
 No longer bound 
 You called me out of the grave 
 You called me into the light 
 You called my name and then my heart came alive 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Feel the darkness shaking 
 All the dead are coming back to life 
 Back to life 
 Hear the song awaken 
 All creation singing we're alive 
 'Cause you're alive 
 You called me out of the grave 
 You called me into the light 
 You called my name and then my heart came alive 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 And what a love we found 
 Death can't hold us down 
 We shout it out 
 We're alive, 'cause you're alive 
 And what a love we found 
 Death can't hold us down 
 We shout it out 
 We're alive, 'cause you're alive 
 And what a love we found 
 Death can't hold us down 
 We shout it out 
 We're alive, 'cause you're alive 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Your love is greater, your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me

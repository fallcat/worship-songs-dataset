Staring at a blank wall and its whitewashed face 
 Not knowing why I had to choose this way 
 I discern I was wrong in my way 
 Looking for peace in another, another domain 
 And I realize that it's true I seek You 
 Whoa 
 I realize that it's true I need You 
 And I reach out and I touch You and I know that I need You 
 To reach out and to touch me and I know 
 I know that I need Your touch 
 Not knowing why I ever retreated from Your arms 
 A mistake I made 
 Now oh Lord I feel Your warm embrace 
 Contentment fills my soul as joy lights my face 
 And I realize that it's true I seek You 
 Whoa 
 I realize that it's true I need You 
 And I reach out and I touch you and I know that I need You 
 To reach out and to touch me and I know 
 I know that I need Your touch 
 You look into the sky 
 And see His arms of love reaching out for me 
 His arms of love and grace 
 And you know you need Him, you need His touch 
 I need Your, I need Your, and I need Your... 
 Touch 
 I was lost but now I'm found 
 I was lost but now I'm found 
 I was lost but now I'm found 
 Your touch 
 I was lost but now I'm found 
 I was lost but now I'm found 
 I was lost but now I'm found 
 Your touch 
 Your touch 
 Your touch 
 Your touch 
 And I reach out and I touch You and I know that I need You 
 To reach out and to touch me and I know that I need You 
 To reach out and to touch me and I know 
 I know that I need Your touch 
 Your touch 
 Your touch 
 Your touch

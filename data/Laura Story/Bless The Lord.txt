You give and take away for my good 
 For who am I to say what I need? 
 For You alone see the hidden parts of me 
 That need to be stripped away. 
 And as You begin to refine 
 I'm learning to let go and rely 
 On One who walks with me 
 As hard as it may be, 
 You're teaching me all the while to say: 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 All that's in me bless Your name 
 Forget not Your power untold 
 Not Your glory or Your fame 
 For You came to heal the broken 
 To redeem and make me whole 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 Lord, You give and take away for my good 
 For who am I to say what I need? 
 For You alone see the hidden parts of me 
 That need to be stripped away. 
 And as You begin to refine 
 I'm learning to let go and rely 
 On One who walks with me 
 As hard as it may be, 
 You're teaching me all the while to say: 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 All that's in me bless Your name 
 Forget not Your power untold 
 Not Your glory or Your fame 
 For You came to heal the broken 
 To redeem and make me whole 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 Though my faith may falter, my strength may fail 
 I pray for eyes to see the richness of Your mercy shown to me! 
 Bless the Lord, bless the Lord... 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 All that's in me bless Your name 
 Forget not Your power untold 
 Not Your glory or Your fame 
 For You came to heal the broken 
 To redeem and make me whole 
 Bless the Lord, bless the Lord 
 Oh my soul, oh my soul 
 Bless the Lord, bless the Lord

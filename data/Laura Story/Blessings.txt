We pray for blessings 
 We pray for peace 
 Comfort for family, protection while we sleep 
 We pray for healing, for prosperity 
 We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering 
 All the while, You hear each spoken need 
 Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things 
 'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops 
 What if Your healing comes through tears 
 What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know You're near 
 What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise 
 We pray for wisdom 
 Your voice to hear 
 We cry in anger when we cannot feel You near 
 We doubt your goodness, we doubt your love 
 As if every promise from Your Word is not enough 
 All the while, You hear each desperate plea 
 And long that we'd have faith to believe 
 When friends betray us 
 When darkness seems to win 
 We know that pain reminds this heart 
 That this is not our home 
 What if my greatest disappointments 
 Or the aching of this life 
 Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy 
 What if trials of this life 
 The rain, the storms, the hardest nights 
 Are your mercies in disguise

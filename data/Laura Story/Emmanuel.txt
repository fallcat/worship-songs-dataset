Once in royal David's city 
 Stood a lowly cattle shed, 
 Where a mother laid her baby 
 In a manger bed: 
 Mary was that mother mild, 
 Jesus Christ her little child. 
 Emmanuel 
 The promise kept 
 Its longing of my heart for God in flesh 
 Through this child, all earth is blessed 
 Emmanuel 
 He came down to earth from heaven, 
 Who is God and Lord of all, 
 And his shelter was a stable, 
 And his cradle was a stall; 
 With the poor, the scorned, the lowly, 
 Lived on earth our Savior holy. 
 Our answered prayer 
 Our faith's reward 
 Redemption's near 
 Redemption's here 
 Emmanuel 
 We will rejoice 
 We will worship you, our Savior and our Lord 
 We will join creation's voice 
 Emmanuel

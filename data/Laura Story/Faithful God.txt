Faithful God by Laura Story 
 May the grace that sought my heart on that first day 
 Be the grace that binds my heart to stay 
 May the truth that opened up my eyes on that first time 
 Be the thoughts on my mind that never go away 
 For You are a lamp to my feet 
 A light to my path 
 You're the hand that's holding me 
 Faithful God, every promise kept 
 Every need You've met, Faithful God 
 All I am and all I'll ever be 
 Is all because You love faithfully 
 Faithful God 
 May the love that caught my heart to set it free 
 Be the love that others see in me 
 And may this hope that's reaches to the depths of human need 
 Be the song that I sing in joy and suffering 
 For you are the love that never leaves 
 The friend that won't deceive 
 You're the one sure thing 
 Faithful God, every promise kept 
 Every need You've met, Faithful God 
 All I am and all I'll ever be 
 Is all because You love faithfully 
 Faithful God 
 How deep, how wide the love 
 That pierced His side, the love 
 Redemption's mine, O Love that will not let me go 
 How deep the love (How deep, how wide the love) 
 How deep the love (That pierced His side, the love) 
 Redemption's mine, O Love that will not let me go 
 How deep, how wide the love 
 That pierced His side, the love 
 Redemption's mine, O Love that will not let me go

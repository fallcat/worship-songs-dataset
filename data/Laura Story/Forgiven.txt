Do you remember 
 The last hand that was held out to you, 
 The last time you heard the words inviting you to come, 
 The last time there were arms open wide for you 
 Do you remember 
 Ever knowing anyone 
 Who saw you as someone 
 Who called you by name and said 
 Forgiven 
 Every word and deed you are forgiven 
 He says to you, my child, 
 You are chosen, you are loved 
 You are forgiven 
 Do you remember 
 Last time you truly felt safe 
 The last time you were honest about you feeling pain 
 Knowing there was someone who could take that guilt away 
 Do you remember 
 When you heard the words of love 
 Living in your heart 
 That you are worth the cost 
 You are forgiven 
 Every word and deed you are forgiven 
 He says to you, my child, 
 You are chosen, you are loved 
 You are forgiven 
 I am set free 
 All my stains are washed clean 
 Jesus, my God and King 
 Thank You for saving me 
 I am forgiven 
 I am forgiven 
 I am chosen, I am loved 
 I am forgiven 
 I have been set free, I've been forgiven 
 You say to me, my child, 
 You are chosen, you are loved 
 And that will always be enough 
 I am forgiven

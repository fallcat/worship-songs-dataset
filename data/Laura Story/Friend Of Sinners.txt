You have shown us what is holy 
 How to bless the Father's heart 
 To act justly and love mercy 
 To walk humbly with our God 
 This is who you are 
 This is who you are 
 Friend of sinners, our Deliverer 
 Jesus, Savior of the world 
 Sent from heaven, King of Glory 
 Yet the Servant of us all 
 So give us hearts to help the widow 
 Give us hands that feed the poor 
 Give us words that bring your healing 
 To this hurts and broken world 
 'Cause this is who you are 
 This is who you are 
 Friend of sinners, our Deliverer 
 Jesus, Savior of the world 
 Sent from heaven, King of Glory 
 Yet the Servant of us all 
 In kindness and meekness 
 You've revealed the unseen God 
 In mercy You've shown us 
 Who You are 
 Friend of sinners, our Deliverer 
 Jesus, Savior of the world 
 Sent from heaven, King of Glory 
 Yet the Servant of us all 
 You, Friend of sinners, our Deliverer 
 Jesus, Savior of the world 
 Sent from heaven, King of Glory 
 Yet the Servant of us all

Amy she lives down the street 
 And her husband left her just last week. 
 She feels like giving up, 
 But she's holding on to hope. 
 John lost his job six months ago. 
 He's got a wife, three kids at home. 
 Doesn't know what to do, 
 He's praying for a breakthrough. 
 Some wanna raise a fist up high, 
 Blame all the hard things on the Father in the sky, 
 But He hears when we call. 
 We can trust him through it all. 
 He's the God of every story, 
 He sees each tear that falls. 
 We may not understand but one thing is certain. 
 He is faithful, He's a faithful God. 
 Jordan's had a lifetime of hard days 
 And all the pills won't take the pain away, 
 But before he hits the ground 
 He see Mercy reaching down. 
 He's the God of every story, 
 He sees each tear that falls. 
 We may not understand but one thing is certain. 
 He is faithful, He's a faithful God. 
 His ways are holier 
 Than we could ever comprehend. 
 When our world is shaking, 
 He holds us in the palm of His hand. 
 Young Martin is thankful he's alive; 
 The doctors said he might not survive. 
 That was seven years ago... 
 What a miracle. 
 And now there's this new baby girl 
 And with one breath she's changed our whole world. 
 Some say she looks like dad, 
 But she looks like grace to me. 
 Your grace to me. 
 You're the God of every story, 
 You see each tear that falls. 
 We may not understand but one thing is certain. 
 You are faithful, You are faithful. 
 You're the God of every story, 
 No matter what I'm going through. 
 I may not understand, You are God and I am just a man. 
 Yeah I'm forever trusting in Your plan. 
 One thing is certain 
 You are faithful, You're faithful God.

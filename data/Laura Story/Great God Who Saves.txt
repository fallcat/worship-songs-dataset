Oh the promises of God, 
 The rock on which I stand 
 The Truth to which I cling 
 His love that knows no bounds 
 He showers us with grace 
 Withholding no good thing 
 When I stumble 
 And my faith is small 
 I will call your name 
 Great God who saves 
 I would have despaired 
 If I had not believed 
 That You would come to me 
 Great God who saves 
 In my darkest hour 
 Your mercy and Your power 
 Are reaching out to me 
 Great God who saves 
 Oh the mystery of God, 
 Who holds all space and time 
 Yet knows my every need 
 The vastness of Your power 
 The strength You give the weak 
 I soar on eagle's wings 
 When I stumble 
 And my faith is small 
 I will call Your name 
 Great God who saves 
 I would have despaired 
 If I had not believed 
 That You would come to me 
 Great God who saves 
 In my darkest hour 
 Your mercy and Your power 
 Are reaching out to me 
 Great God who saves 
 And in my pain and in my need 
 You heard me calling out Your name 
 When I was blind and could not see 
 You stepped in and saved a wretch like me 
 You saved a wretch like me 
 And I would have despaired 
 If I had not believed 
 That You would come to me 
 Great God who saves 
 In my darkest hour 
 Your mercy and Your power 
 Are reaching out to me 
 Great God who saves

It may take time, on this journey slow 
 What lies ahead, I'm not sure I know 
 But the hand that holds this flailing soul 
 He will not let go 
 There may be days, when I cannot breathe 
 There may be scars, that will stay with me 
 But the deepest stains, they will be washed clean 
 And He will not let go 
 When all around my soul gives way 
 He then is all my hope and stay 
 When grief has paralyzed my heart 
 His grip holds even tighter than the dark 
 I've heard it said, this too shall pass 
 The joy will come, that the hurt won't last 
 So I will trust that within His grasp 
 I am not alone 
 For He will not let go

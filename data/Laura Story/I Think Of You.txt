When I think of sunlight piercing through the clouds 
 That paint a perfect sky 
 I think of the silver lining of Your love 
 And I think of You 
 When I think of streams that weave through desert lands 
 As beauty comes alive 
 I think of the healing fountain of Your grace in my 
 Life 
 In my life 
 And I think of You who shines with endless light 
 Through broken jars of clay 
 And I think of You redeeming every part of each day 
 That you've made 
 And I think of you 
 When I think of children laughing full of wonder 
 And families reconciled 
 I think of the joy that's found in answered prayer 
 And it makes me smile 
 Makes me smile 
 And I think of You who shines with endless light 
 Through broken jars of clay 
 And I think of You redeeming every part of each day 
 That you've made 
 And I think of You 
 For redemption's now that story of my soul 
 'Cause it was You who paid the highest price 
 For broken jars of clay 
 And You still choose to use my life 
 For Your glory displayed 
 And I think of You who shines with endless light 
 Through broken jars of clay 
 And I think of You redeeming every part of each day 
 That you've made 
 And I think of you 
 I think of You

Immortal, You are not are like a man 
 That you change Your mind 
 Or change Your plan 
 Invisible, our human eyes can't see 
 The Depths of Your majesty 
 You're the God of forever and ever amen 
 The alpha, omega, beginning and end 
 We sing Hallelujah 
 We worship in awe 
 Immortal, invisible God 
 Immortal, You are not bound by death 
 You're the living God, my very breath 
 Invisible You are not bound by space 
 But Your glory is filling this place 
 Yes Your glory is filling this place 
 You're the God of forever and ever amen 
 The alpha, omega, beginning and end 
 We sing Hallelujah 
 We worship in awe 
 Immortal, invisible God 
 Immortal yet You once died for me, 
 To pay my debt to set me free 
 Invisible You will not always be 
 'Cause You're coming to reign as our king 
 And the saints will fall down at Your feet 
 You're the God of forever and ever amen 
 The alpha, omega, beginning and end 
 We sing Hallelujah 
 We worship in awe 
 Immortal, invisible God 
 We sing Hallelujah 
 We worship in awe 
 Immortal, invisible God 
 Immortal, invisible God

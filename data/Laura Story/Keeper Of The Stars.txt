Against all hope in hope I believe, 
 That You Lord are faithful, 
 You're good and You are able. 
 When it seems impossible to me, 
 Your promises are all true, 
 What You said I know You will do. 
 And I am sure 
 Your love endures 
 I'm giving it all 
 To the Keeper of the stars 
 I won't be afraid 
 'Cause You're holding every part 
 Of this world 
 And my heart trusts You that 
 You won't let me fall 
 I'm giving it all 
 To the Keeper of the stars 
 Against all hope in hope I believe, 
 Your plan for me is perfect 
 And You show me it's all worth it. 
 With eyes of faith You teach me to see, 
 And lighten every dark night, 
 Knowing it will be alright. 
 And I am sure 
 That Your love endures, yeah 
 I'm giving it all 
 To the Keeper of the stars 
 I won't be afraid 
 'Cause You're holding every part 
 Of this world 
 And my heart trusts You that 
 You won't let me fall 
 I'm giving it all 
 To the Keeper of the stars 
 You're the Keeper of the stars 
 Look up now, O my soul 
 See His greatness and behold, behold! 
 Look up now, O my soul 
 See His wonders and behold, behold! 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 To the Keeper of the stars 
 I won't be afraid 
 'Cause You're holding every part 
 Of this world 
 And my heart trusts You that 
 You won't let me fall 
 I'm giving it all 
 To the Keeper of the stars 
 You're the Keeper of the stars 
 The Keeper of the stars

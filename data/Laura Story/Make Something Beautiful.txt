When I'm at the point of breaking at the place where I resign, 
 When I'm at the stage of shaking my head as I look back on my life, 
 When I'm halfway through the grieving, but not quite through the ache, 
 When I cannot see the ending, or which road I'm supposed to take, 
 All I know to do is lift my hands to You 
 Take all of my life, all of my life, 
 And make something beautiful. 
 I open my hand, trusting Your plan. 
 Make something beautiful so all will see 
 Your work in me, as You make something beautiful 
 When I'm tired of pretending, and I can't recall my lines, 
 Do I say, I'm barely breathing, or just say, I'm doing fine. 
 I admit there is a yearning, for the hurting to subside, 
 But not at the risk of missing what You're doing with my life 
 All I know to do is lift my hands to You... 
 Take all of my life, all of my life, 
 And make something beautiful. 
 I open my hand, trusting Your plan. 
 Make something beautiful so all will see 
 Your work in me, as You make something beautiful 
 Make something beautiful 
 'Cause all I know to do is lift my hands to You. 
 All I know to do is lift my hands to You. 
 Take all of my life, all of my life, 
 And make something beautiful. 
 I open my hand, trusting Your plan. 
 Make something beautiful 
 Take all of my life, all of my life, 
 And make something beautiful. 
 I open my hand, I'm trusting Your plan. 
 To make something beautiful, so all will see 
 Your work in me, as You make something beautiful 
 Make something beautiful 
 You make it beautiful

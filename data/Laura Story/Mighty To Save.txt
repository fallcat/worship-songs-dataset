Everyone needs compassion 
 A love that's never failing 
 Let mercy fall on me, 
 Everyone needs forgiveness 
 The kindness of a Saviour, 
 The hope of nations. 
 Saviour, He can move the mountains, 
 My God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save, 
 Forever, author of salvation, 
 He rose and conquered the grave, 
 Jesus conquered the grave. 
 So take me as you find me, 
 All my fears and failures, 
 Fill my life again. 
 I give my life to follow, Everything I believe in, 
 Now I surrender, 
 Yes, I surrender 
 Saviour, He can move the mountains, 
 My God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save, 
 Forever, author of salvation, 
 He rose and conquered the grave. 
 Shine your light and let the whole world see, 
 We're singing for the glory of the risen King, Jesus, 
 Shine your light and let the whole world see, 
 We're singing for the glory of the risen King. 
 Saviour, He can move the mountain, 
 My God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save, 
 Forever, author of salvation, 
 He rose and conquered the grave. 
 Jesus conquered the grave! 
 You're my Saviour, You can move the mountains, 
 God, You are mighty to save, You are mighty to save, 
 Forever, author of salvation, 
 You rose and conquered the grave, 
 Yes, you conquered the grave. 
 You are mighty to save.

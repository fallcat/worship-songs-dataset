O love of God, strong and true, 
 In my barren soul a river running free. 
 O love of God, swift and straight, 
 You have washed away my sin and leave no trace. 
 River rise and carry me away 
 I see You in the stars above 
 I feel You in the earth below 
 In waves that swell, in winds that blow 
 I marvel at the mystery 
 That One so great could love someone like me 
 Undeserved and free 
 O love of God 
 O love of God 
 O love of God, wonder's to me 
 That this quivering soul was lost and found in Thee. 
 O love of God, my shield and spade, 
 Will You turn me to the oceans of Your grace? 
 River rise and carry me away 
 I see You in the stars above 
 I feel You in the earth below 
 In waves that swell, in winds that blow 
 I marvel at the mystery 
 That One so great could love someone like me 
 Undeserved and free 
 O love of God 
 O love of God 
 River rise and carry me away 
 I see You in the stars above 
 I feel You in the earth below 
 In waves that swell, in winds that blow 
 I marvel at the mystery 
 That One so great could love someone like me 
 Undeserved and free 
 O love of God 
 O love of God 
 O love of God 
 O love of God

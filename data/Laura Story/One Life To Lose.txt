I'm torn again between my pride, my old friend 
 And who you've called me to be 
 I've sworn again to lay it down, to bring an end 
 To this life lived for me 
 For I've one life to lose, one chance to find 
 A newer, better me, the old one left behind 
 For there's one Lord who leads though steep the cost 
 I have learned when I am lost, it's there that I am found 
 I am found as your daughter, as your child 
 As one purchased by Your blood 
 And though there's nothing I can add to such a perfect sacrifice 
 How can I offer you less than all my life? 
 For I've one life to lose, one chance to find 
 A newer, better me, the old one left behind 
 For there's one Lord who leads how steep the cost 
 I have learned when I am lost, it's there that I am found 
 It's there that I am found 
 For I've one life to lose, one chance to find 
 A newer, better me, the old one left behind 
 For there's one Lord who leads how steep the cost 
 I have learned when I am lost 
 I have learned when I am lost, it's there that I am found 
 It's there that I am found

Stay close by my side 
 Keep your eyes on me 
 Though this life is hard 
 I will give you perfect peace 
 In this time of trial 
 Pain that no one sees 
 Trust me when I say 
 I will give you perfect peace 
 And you'll never walk alone 
 And you'll never be in need 
 Though I may not calm the storms around you 
 You can hide in me 
 Burdens that you bear 
 Offer no relief 
 Let me bear your load 
 'Cause I will give you perfect peace 
 Stay close by my side 
 And you'll never walk alone 
 Keep your eyes on me 
 And you'll never be in need 
 Though this life is hard 
 Know that I will always give you perfect peace 
 I will give you perfect peace

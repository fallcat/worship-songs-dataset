Henry loves the ballpark 
 But lately he ain't coming round 
 Things have been so different 
 Since his youngest boy left town 
 Fighting seem so harmless 
 Families sometimes disagree 
 It's hard to know the reason 
 Why he finally chose to leave 
 But he's gone away, his father waits 
 And he is watching and he is hoping 
 Though his eyes are weary, his arms are still open 
 And his prayer so softly spoken 
 Please come home 
 Now Henry sits and wonders 
 In that front porch rocking chair 
 Does his boy remember 
 All the love the family shared 
 And is he cold out there alone? 
 And he is watching and he is hoping 
 Though his eyes are weary, his arms are still open 
 And his prayer so softly spoken 
 Please come home 
 To your seat at the table 
 To your father who weeps 
 Every night in sleepless dreams 
 He longs to see his face in younger skin 
 Running down the driveway again 
 And he is watching and he is hoping 
 Though his eyes are weary, his arms are still open 
 And his prayer so softly spoken 
 Please come home

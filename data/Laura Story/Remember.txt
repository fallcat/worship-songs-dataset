This is the body that was torn for us 
 This is the blood that was spilt 
 Points to the pain you endured for us 
 Points to the shame, the blame, the guilt 
 Father, Son and Holy Spirit, come 
 Move our hearts to remember 
 This is the Lamb who was slain for us 
 So we the church may enter in 
 So bitter sweet when we think of You 
 The One who bore our curse, our sin 
 Father, Son and Holy Spirit, come 
 Move our hearts to remember, to remember 
 Father, Son and Holy Spirit, come 
 Father, Son and Holy Spirit, come 
 Move our hearts to remember

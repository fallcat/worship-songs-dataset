There is a kingdom coming here tonight 
 There is a kingdom coming here tonight 
 We're waiting, believing, our God is alive 
 There is a kingdom coming here tonight 
 There is a stirring in this holy place 
 There is a stirring in this holy place 
 Your Spirit is urging our hearts to awake 
 There is a stirring in this holy place 
 Church arise and, sing for the joy 
 Sing for the joy we found 
 With our lives we, shout out Your praise 
 God, we proclaim Your Kingdom's coming 
 There is a fire started in our souls 
 There is a fire started in our souls 
 Reviving, it's longing, You're calling us home 
 There is a fire started in our souls 
 Church arise and, sing for the joy 
 Sing for the joy we found 
 With our lives we, shout out Your praise 
 God, we proclaim Your Kingdom's coming 
 Every eye with expectation 
 Every heart an invitation 
 Every eye with expectation 
 Every heart an invitation 
 Church arise and, sing for the joy 
 Sing for the joy we found 
 With our lives we, shout out Your praise 
 God, we proclaim Your Kingdom's coming 
 Every eye with expectation 
 Every heart an invitation

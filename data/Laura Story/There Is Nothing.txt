Lord I come before You 
 To honor and adore You 
 For who You are and all that You have done 
 Lord I am not worthy 
 My heart is dark and dirty 
 Still somehow You bid for me to come 
 So clothe me in humility 
 Remind me, that I come before a King 
 And there is nothing 
 There is nothing 
 More precious, more worthy 
 May I gaze deeper 
 May I stand longer 
 May I press onward to know You Lord 
 May our time be sweeter 
 May I be a keeper 
 Of the promises I make to You in song 
 Lord may I remember these moments of surrender 
 And live my life this way from this day on 
 So clothe me in humility 
 Remind me, that I come before a King 
 And there is nothing 
 There is nothing 
 More precious, more worthy 
 May I gaze deeper 
 May I stand longer 
 May I press onward to know You Lord 
 So clothe me in humility 
 Remind me, [pause]... that I come before a King 
 And there is nothing 
 There is nothing 
 More precious, more worthy 
 May I gaze deeper 
 May I stand longer 
 May I press onward to know You Lord 
 May I press onward to know You Lord

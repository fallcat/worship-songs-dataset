I'm not the same, I have been changed 
 By the power of Christ, the truth in my life 
 I can't explain the difference He's made 
 Old things have gone, something new has begun 
 This is the day of my salvation 
 I will rejoice with a song of praise 
 This is the day of my salvation 
 I will rejoice in Christ, my salvation 
 I'm not the same, I have been changed 
 The hope that I've found has turned me around 
 I finally feel forgiveness that's real 
 This thankful heart gets a brand new start, yeah 
 This is the day of my salvation 
 I will rejoice with a song of praise 
 This is the day of my salvation 
 I will rejoice in Christ, my salvation 
 Come, let us be glad, come, let us rejoice 
 Come, let us be glad, come, let us rejoice 
 Come, let us be glad, come, let us rejoice 
 And come, let us be glad, and come, let us rejoice, yeah 
 This is the day of my salvation 
 I will rejoice with a song of praise 
 This is the day of my salvation 
 I will rejoice in Christ, my salvation

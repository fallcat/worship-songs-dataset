I've known pain and deep regret 
 I've known the weight of my mistakes like the back of my hand 
 I've known deception and all its games 
 I've known the way it feels to drown in my own shame 
 But I never knew love 
 I never knew truth 
 I never knew peace, the sweet release that brought me through 
 I never knew freedom, what grace could do 
 The broken chains, the hope that saves, a life made new 
 Till I met You 
 I've known rejections 
 I've bought the lie that I could never overcome the hurt inside 
 With arms of mercy You reach for me 
 Tore the veil away and gave me eyes to see 
 You're all I need 
 And I never knew love 
 I never knew truth 
 I never knew peace, the sweet release that brought me through 
 I never knew freedom, what grace could do 
 The broken chains, the hope that saves, a life made new 
 Till I met You (I'm accepting I was hopeless) 
 Till I met You (I was stumbling in the darkness) 
 I never knew love 
 I never knew truth 
 I never knew peace, the sweet release 
 You're the one Who brought me through 
 And I never knew freedom, what grace could do 
 The broken chains, the hope that saves, a life made new 
 Till I met You (till I met You) 
 Till I met You (till I met You) 
 Till I met You

Where can I run in times of trouble? 
 Where can I turn when hope seems lost? 
 I find my strength within Your shelter 
 You will not fail though the night is long 
 Who is like our God? 
 Mighty in the battle 
 Your Majesty be lifted high 
 Who is like our God? 
 He reaches for the broken 
 Jesus hears me when I cry 
 How can it be that You are for me? 
 Though I am weak, Your love is strong 
 You are my light and my salvation 
 In Your name alone, I overcome 
 Who is like our God? 
 Mighty in the battle 
 Your Majesty be lifted high 
 Who is like our God? 
 He reaches for the broken 
 Jesus hears me when I cry 
 Who else can help us? 
 Who else can save? 
 Who else can overcome the power of the grave? 
 Who else can heal us? 
 Break every chain? 
 There is no one, no one else 
 There is no one, no one else 
 Who is like our God? 
 Mighty in the battle 
 Your Majesty be lifted high 
 Who is like our God? 
 He reaches for the broken 
 Jesus hears my cry 
 Who is like our God? 
 Mighty in the battle 
 Your Majesty be lifted high 
 Who is like our God? 
 He reaches for the broken 
 Jesus hears me when I cry 
 He hears me when I cry 
 He hears me when I cry 
 Who is like, who is like our God?

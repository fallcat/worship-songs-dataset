You are justice for every oppression 
 You're forgiveness for every confession 
 You are beauty, goodness, blessing, You are love 
 You are healing for every sickness 
 You are power in every weakness 
 You are mighty, holy, faithful, You are love 
 Oh God of the heavens 
 You descended from your throne 
 Gave Your Son for our ransom 
 And by this all men will know that You are love 
 We were thirsty, You gave us water 
 We were orphans, now You are our Father 
 We were desperate, hungry, seeking, You are love 
 Oh God of the heavens 
 You descended from your throne 
 Gave Your Son for our ransom 
 And by this all men will know 
 Oh God of the heavens 
 You descended from your throne 
 Gave Your Son for our ransom 
 And by this all men will know that You are love 
 You are love 
 Everlasting, never ending 
 All consuming, You are love 
 Everlasting 
 (Everlasting) 
 Never ending 
 (Never ending) 
 All consuming, You are love, You are love 
 Oh God of the heavens 
 (Everlasting) 
 You descended from your throne 
 (Never ending) 
 Gave Your Son for our ransom 
 (All consuming, You are love) 
 And by this all men will know 
 Oh God of the heavens 
 (Everlasting) 
 You descended from your throne 
 (Never ending) 
 Gave Your Son for our ransom 
 (All consuming, You are love) 
 And by this all men will know that You are love 
 (Everlasting) 
 You are love 
 (Never ending)

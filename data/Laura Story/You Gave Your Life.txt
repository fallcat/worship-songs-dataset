I was found 
 As a beggar, as an orphan with no home 
 No family 
 I was found 
 With a stain as deep as darkness fills the night 
 But the wonder does not lie in the depression of my state 
 But that You found me at all is simply grace upon grace 
 You gave Your life for me 
 This man dreams oh to see 
 How far, how wide 
 How deep, how high 
 Is the relentless love of God 
 And now I find 
 That the comforts of this heart are not in things 
 Or in the joys that this life brings 
 But just to be 
 The reworkmanship of God to know He's with me 
 To know He's for me 
 And I can't begin to comprehend just why He's chosen me 
 But I'd spend a thousand lifetimes giving thanks 
 Giving You thanks 
 You gave Your life for me 
 This man dreams oh to see 
 How far, how wide 
 How deep, how high 
 Is the relentless love of God 
 I'm undeserving 
 Of grace so amazing 
 Though free to me 
 It cost You everything 
 You gave Your life for me 
 This man dreams so to see 
 How far, how wide 
 How deep, how high 
 Is the relentless love of God

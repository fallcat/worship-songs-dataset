From the rising sun 
 To the end of the day 
 Your name will be praised, Jesus 
 Your name will be praised 
 From the prophets of old 
 To the mouths of babes 
 Your name will be praised, Jesus 
 Your name will be praised 
 Glory to You, exalted One 
 Who gave Your life away 
 Glory to You, our risen King 
 Jesus, Your name will be praised 
 Your name will be praised 
 For the gift of new life 
 For Your mercies each day 
 Your name will be praised, Jesus 
 Your name will be praised 
 Through the darkest of nights 
 When we can't find out way 
 We will walk by faith not sight, Lord 
 And Your name will be praised 
 Glory to You, exalted One 
 Who gave Your life away 
 Glory to You, our risen King 
 Jesus, Your name will be praised 
 Your name will be praised 
 For who You are 
 For what You've done 
 For what You've yet to do 
 The song we raise 
 This day we proclaim 
 All glory to You, all glory to You 
 Exalted One who gave Your life away 
 Glory to You, our risen King 
 Jesus, Your name will be praised 
 Your name will be praised 
 Your name will be praised

If I ascend Heavens You're there 
 If I make my bed in Sheol You're with me 
 If I arise on the wings of the dawn 
 If I sink in the sea there Your hand will find me 
 Ooh 
 There is no deepest depths, highest heights 
 With You 
 Even the dark is light, dark is light 
 In the silence, In the darkest hour 
 When you can barely whisper 
 And there's no place to hide 
 Every ocean is just a drop of water 
 Every desert a footstep 
 There's no space too wide 
 When you cry, when you fall, when you hurt 
 I'll be with you 
 Through it all in your tears and your fears 
 Don't you worry 
 I am near, I am here, I'll be there 
 With you in the dead of night, dead of night 
 Dead of night, dead of night 
 You can stand on my shoulders 
 In the valley of the shadows 
 Through the struggle 
 I am fighting for you 
 Feel my heartbeat racing 
 I'm here by your side

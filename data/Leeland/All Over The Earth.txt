Oh, we give You praises 
 For You alone are holy 
 Jesus, Your name is greater 
 For You alone are holy 
 We want to see 
 Your victory 
 All over the earth 
 All over the earth 
 Your kingdom come 
 Your will be done 
 All over the Earth 
 All over the Earth 
 All glory in the highest 
 All glory in the highest 
 Be lifted up, Lord 
 Be lifted up, Lord 
 You are holy 
 You are holy

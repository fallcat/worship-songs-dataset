When the storm is raging all around me 
 You are the peace that calms 
 My troubled sea 
 And when the cares of this world 
 Darken my day 
 You are the light that shines 
 And shows me the way 
 Oh, the beauty of Your majesty 
 On the cross You showed Your love for me! 
 Beautiful Lord 
 Awesome and mighty 
 I'm captured by this love I see 
 Beautiful Lord 
 Tender and holy 
 Your mercy brings me to my knees 
 It's Your mercy that has made me free 
 Beautiful Lord 
 When my sin is all that I can see 
 Your grace remains the shelter that I seek 
 And when my weakness is all I can give 
 Your gentle Spirit gives me strength again 
 And oh, the beauty of Your majesty 
 On the cross You showed Your love for me 
 And I am lifted by Your love to sing! 
 It's Your mercy that has made me free! 
 You're beautiful, my Lord 
 You're beautiful, my Lord

Out of darkness into light 
 I know that I will be alright 
 Here inside Your hands 
 I never want to stray too far 
 Just want to be where You are 
 Here inside Your plan 
 And You're the center of 
 The beginning and the end 
 And I place my life inside Your hands 
 You hold for me a perfect plan 
 And You are the beginning and the end 
 Everything that I've done wrong 
 Put You there on that cross 
 Where nails drove in Your hands 
 A crown of thorns deep in Your brow 
 I never knew it until now 
 It was all Your plan 
 God, You've always been 
 The beginning and the end 
 You have plans for me 
 You've given me a hope and a future 
 You have plans for me 
 You've given me a hope and a future 
 I place my life inside Your hands 
 You hold for me a perfect plan 
 And You are the beginning and the end

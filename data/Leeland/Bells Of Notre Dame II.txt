You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling 
 And I know You're with me in the night 
 And I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 And You're with me when I'm traveling

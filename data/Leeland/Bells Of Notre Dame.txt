I know You're with me in the night 
 I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 You're with me when I'm traveling 
 I know You're with me in the night 
 I know You're with me in the day 
 You're with me when I'm sitting down 
 You're with me when I'm traveling 
 Where can I run 
 Where can I run 
 Where can I run 
 You're everywhere I go

I see You kneeling in the garden 
 As tears of love pour down 
 I hear You calling on the Father 
 "Not my will but Yours be done" 
 I see You lifting up the broken 
 I see Your life poured out 
 I hear You praying on the mountain 
 "Father I will follow You" 
 Jesus, I will follow You 
 I will wait, for my trust is in The Lord 
 I will wait, Jesus You are my reward 
 As I wait You reveal Your majesty 
 In the silence, You are singing over me 
 "You are my beloved" 
 I will kneel before You Jesus 
 As my heart pours out 
 I am calling on You Father 
 Not my will but Yours be done 
 Not my will but Yours be done 
 I will take up my cross 
 As I follow You Lord 
 I will count all as loss 
 As I wait on You Lord 
 I will wait, for my trust is in the Lord 
 I will wait, Jesus You are my reward 
 As I wait You reveal Your majesty 
 In the silence, You are singing over me 
 "You are my beloved" 
 "You are my beloved" 
 "You are my beloved" 
 "You are my beloved" 
 I see your people in a room 
 I hear a rushing sound 
 Every heart is drawn Jesus 
 As Your Spirit pours out

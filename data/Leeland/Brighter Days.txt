Time keeps moving on 
 Through the sunshine and the storm 
 And my dreams are set in stone 
 And someday I'll be who I want to be 
 For now I'll wait 
 For the sun to shine again 
 And for now I'll wait 
 For the rain to pass away 
 And I'm looking for the brighter days 
 When all my hurts seem to fade away 
 I'm looking for the brighter days to come my way 
 Faces come and faces go 
 But none seem to look my way 
 And walls have stood and walls have fallen 
 But my heart seems to wait 
 For now I'll sit at the end of the road 
 And for now I'll wait 
 At the end of the pathway 
 I'll see the sun one day shine upon me 
 I'll see the sun one day 
 And watch the nighttime turn to morning 
 But for now it all comes back around

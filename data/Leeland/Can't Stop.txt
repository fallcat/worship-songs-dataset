I can't believe You're here close to me 
 It's getting hard to stand 
 But I don't want to leave 
 Your beauty stands out 
 Like a bright light shining through the clouds 
 It's overwhelming just to be with You now 
 I can't stop, I can't stop falling in love with You 
 I can't stop, I can't stop falling in love with You 
 Your love is in my heart tonight (yes, I know) 
 I can't stop, I can't stop falling in love with You 
 I'm in love with You 
 In this space and time 
 You touch my soul 
 I can't escape Your love for me 
 So You take control 
 Your spirit surrounds me 
 Close enough to catch me when I fall 
 I can't escape Your love for me 
 I surrender all 
 You've risen like the sun 
 Darkness fades with the dawn 
 You are the radiant one 
 And You give me light 
 Your love is in my heart tonight 
 Your love is in my heart tonight 
 I can't stop, I can't stop falling in love with You 
 I can't stop, I can't stop falling in love with You

Wounded and forsaken 
 I was shattered by the fall 
 Broken and forgotten 
 Feeling lost and all alone 
 Summoned by the King 
 Into the Master's courts 
 Lifted by the Savior 
 And cradled in His arms 
 I was carried to the table 
 Seated where I don't belong 
 Carried to the table 
 Swept away by His love 
 And I don't see my brokenness anymore 
 When I'm seated at the table of the Lord 
 I'm carried to the table 
 The table of the Lord 
 Fighting thoughts of fear 
 And wondering why He called my name 
 Am I good enough to share this cup 
 This world has left me lame 
 Even in my weakness 
 The Savior called my name 
 In His Holy presence 
 I'm healed and unashamed 
 You carried me, my God 
 You carried me

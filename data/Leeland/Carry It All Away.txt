Face to the flame 
 I feel the heat when I speak Your name 
 Take this fear and melt it all away 
 Fall to the floor 
 You touch me and the tears start to pour 
 And I don't feel the same anymore 
 Here inside the fire 
 One look in Your eyes and I'm not the same 
 You carry it all away 
 You carry, carry it all away, carry, carry it all away 
 All of my doubts, all of my fears, all of my pain erodes away 
 When I behold Your face, You carry it all away 
 Feet off the floor 
 You lift me up and I start to soar 
 I'm seeing things that I've never seen before 
 You're inside my heart, I'm inside Your arms 
 And I'm not afraid, You carry it all away 
 My tears are washed away 
 My sorrow and my shame is 
 On Your shoulders, it's on your shoulders 
 I know You're in control 
 My future and my hope is 
 On Your shoulders, it's on Your shoulders

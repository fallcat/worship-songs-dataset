Even heroes fall down 
 And mountains won't last forever 
 But Your promise never fails 
 When the ocean is raging 
 I find stillness in Your presence 
 And I lift my voice to say 
 'Jesus take me away! 
 Carry me on your back 
 Through the storm, Lord! 
 Carry me on your back 
 Through the storm, Lord! ' 
 When the furnace is burning 
 I know rescue is coming 
 Your promise never fails 
 In the darkness Your light shines 
 Breaking over the horizon 
 And I lift my eyes to see 
 Heaven's fighting for me 
 'Carry me on your back 
 Through the storm, Lord! 
 Carry me on your back 
 Through the storm, Lord! ' 
 Waking up in the arms of love 
 I'll be singing, singing a new song 
 Waking up in the arms of love 
 I'll be singing, singing a new song 
 Carry me on your back 
 Through the storm, Lord! 
 Carry me on your back 
 Through the storm, Lord!

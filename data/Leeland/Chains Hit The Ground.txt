I'm holding on to You 
 It's all I know to do 
 When fear has had me bound 
 When enemies surround 
 There's freedom in this truth 
 My salvation is in You 
 And I remember the nails that You took for me 
 When You died in my shame and iniquity 
 Jesus, You have set me free 
 The thorns of my pain You wore in a crown 
 When You bowed Your head 
 Your love was poured out 
 And my chains hit the ground 
 You are the Rock I've found 
 Above the shifting ground 
 Amid a raging war 
 You're the One I'm fighting for 
 For all of my years 
 My banner will be clear 
 I am Yours 
 And even though the waves, they crash below 
 I'm holding onto love 
 I'm holding onto love 
 I am Yours 
 Forever all my days, I lay before Your holy love 
 I'm holding onto love

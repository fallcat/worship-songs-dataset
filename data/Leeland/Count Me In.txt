You gave all You had 
 I didn't choose You, You chose me first 
 Even when I turned my back 
 You still gave Your love 
 It's the only thing I wanna have 
 No greater gift than 
 The man to lay down His life 
 How could I miss this, 
 I'm not about to pass it up 
 Count me in 
 I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord 
 Count me in 
 I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord 
 I'm looking at these plans you have 
 For me, they're plans of hope and peace 
 Much bigger than the ones I had 
 I tried to follow mine, I was going nowhere fast 
 Your love makes me like a David with a stone and sling 
 Nothing else could bring my life so much meaning 
 Count me in 
 I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord 
 Count me in 
 I'm amazed this love is for me, Lord 
 I can't believe it 
 I can't believe it 
 I can't believe it 
 Count me in 
 Count me in 
 Count me in 
 You can count me in

First comes salvation 
 Then comes obsession 
 Fire starts with a flicker 
 And it consumes me 
 Suddenly I feel 
 I can follow you blindly because 
 You've covered my eyes with love 
 And You've given me more than enough 
 You've given me more than enough 
 Hide away in Your arms of grace 
 Living life the way that You want me to 
 Don't go away please be here to stay 
 Forever and always 
 It's just me and You 
 Me and You my Lord 
 Mighty King, everlasting God 
 Never-ending flood, the solid rock 
 My love my life my all 
 Your heart becomes my heartbeat 
 You've given me more than enough 
 Answers to the questions in the world 
 You are more than enough 
 You're the answer 
 You're the answer 
 You're the answer

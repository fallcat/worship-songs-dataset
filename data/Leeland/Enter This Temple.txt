We are saved in a world that's lost 
 All our hope rests in your cross 
 God of strength our weakness shows 
 We need You 
 We need You 
 Father, enter this temple 
 Come touch Your people 
 We need to be where You are 
 And children living as their Father 
 Washed in pure water 
 We need to be like you are 
 We are searching for your presence 
 We are knocking on your door 
 Let Your wings cover us with promise 
 For communion 
 For communion 
 To be like you are 
 To be where you are 
 Father, come touch your people 
 To be like you are 
 To be where you are 
 Father, come touch your people

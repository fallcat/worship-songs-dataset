Here I am, remembering 
 I was lost, sin had blinded me 
 Your blood destroyed, what stood between 
 Who I was, and what You saw in me 
 Now I know who I am made to be 
 Take this life I give 
 All for You I live 
 I'm alive to love You Lord 
 Now I walk, in love and faith 
 And boldly come, to Your throne of grace 
 What a joy, to behold Your face 
 And to drink the living water 
 And my spirit sings Abba Father 
 Take this life I give 
 All for You I live 
 I'm alive to love You Lord 
 When my heartbeat fades 
 And I see Your face 
 I will ever love You Lord 
 Jesus You had hope for me 
 Believed in me 
 Endured for me 
 When I was still a sinner 
 Lord You bled and died for me 
 When I was still a sinner 
 You never gave up on me 
 Jesus You had hope for me 
 Believed in me 
 Endured for me 
 When I was still a sinner 
 Lord You bled and died for me 
 When I was still a sinner 
 You never gave up on me

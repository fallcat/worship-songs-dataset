A childlike love I had when we first began 
 We ran and I fell behind 
 I've been stuck here all this time 
 You waited like a lover 
 Who couldn't let go of his bride 
 I turned my back away from you 
 I didn't shed a tear or cry 
 But I'm falling for you now 
 I'm coming back to the place where we parted 
 It's for real this time 
 So I'll be here 
 Waiting where we started 
 My feet were bruised 
 I tried but I couldn't fill your shoes 
 I went my way I bought the lie 
 That I was all grown up, didn't need you in my life 
 The winter left me cold and frozen looking for the truth 
 But searching for the sun I found the place where I met you 
 And I'm falling for you now 
 I'm coming back to the place where we parted 
 It's for real this time 
 So I'll be here waiting where we started 
 Feels so good 
 Here in your arms 
 You never left me 
 I just chose to stay behind 
 I want to thank you for your love 
 That gives me freedom 
 To run back to come back

You live among the least of these: 
 The weary and the weak. 
 And it would be a tragedy 
 For me to turn away. 
 All my needs You have supplied, 
 When I was dead You gave me life. 
 How could I not give it away so freely? 
 And I'll... 
 I'll follow You into the homes of the broken, 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 I'll meet the needs for the poor and the needy, God, 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 Use my hands, use my feet, 
 To make Your kingdom come. 
 To the corners of the earth 
 Until Your work is done. 
 'Cause faith without works is dead, 
 And on the cross, Your blood was shed, 
 So how could we not give it away so freely? 
 And I'll... 
 I'll follow You into the homes of the broken, 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 Oh, meet the needs for the poor and the needy, God, 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 Yeah, 
 I'll follow You into the homes of the broken, 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 Oh, I'll meet the needs for the poor and the needy, God, 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 And I give all myself, 
 I give all myself, 
 And I give all myself to You. 
 Oh, and I give all myself, (I give myself) 
 Yes I give all myself, (Lord, I give myself) 
 And I give all myself to You. (I give it all to You) 
 (Lord I give it all to You) 
 I'll follow You into the homes of the broken, (Homes of the broken) 
 I'll follow You into the world. (I'll follow You) 
 I'll meet the needs for the poor and the needy, God, (Poor and needy, God) 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 I will follow... 
 I'll follow You into the homes of the broken, 
 I'll follow You into the world. 
 I'll meet the needs for the poor and the needy, God.

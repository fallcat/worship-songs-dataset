We have only one life 
 And it soon will pass 
 And only what's done 
 For Christ will last 
 Jesus, You can use me Lord 
 Riches and houses 
 Cars and lands 
 Will all pass away 
 But my life will stand 
 Jesus, You can use me Lord 
 For Your glory 
 For Your glory 
 For Your glory 
 You can use me Lord 
 We say yes Lord 
 We say yes Lord 
 We say yes Lord 
 You can use me Lord

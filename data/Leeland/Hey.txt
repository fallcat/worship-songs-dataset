I'd give myself to find You 
 Stumble and fall to see You 
 You're worth it all 
 To me You are 
 I'd swim across the stormy seas 
 And scream it from the mountain peaks 
 You're worth it all 
 To me You are 
 (And I said) 
 Hey You're the one 
 That I've been looking for 
 And I found You here 
 And I found You here 
 Thinking back on all the times 
 I passed You by with blinded eyes 
 I thought that I 
 Would be just fine 
 Tripping over all my lies 
 I saw you there with no disguise 
 You're worth it all 
 To me You are 
 Do you see my celebration 
 For this open invitation to Your arms, Your arms 
 It's a beautiful fixation 
 As I find myself surrounded by Your love, Your love

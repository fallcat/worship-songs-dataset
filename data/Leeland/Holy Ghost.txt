You said I wouldn't be lonely and in defeat 
 You wouldn't leave me as an orphan 
 No matter where I go, I'm caught in the flow 
 Of Your never-ending fountain 
 I feel You everywhere 
 I breathe You in the air 
 Oh God, come and take me over 
 From my head to my toes 
 Holy Ghost, fill me up 
 From my head to my toes 
 Holy Ghost, fill me up 
 You said that I would do greater things than You 
 But I'll never make it on my own 
 'Cause You are the power in me 
 My strength when I am weak 
 Oh God, come and take me over 
 I will never be forsaken 
 No, I will never be forsaken 
 No matter where I go 
 I'm lost in the flow 
 No matter where I go, Lord 
 I'm lost in Your flow 
 Holy Ghost

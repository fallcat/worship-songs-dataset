Long after the tears fall I'm still your child 
 I put down my defenses and lay down my pride 
 Love and forgiveness flow in deep and wide 
 So I run to you and surrender all! 
 As I lay down my life 
 And pick up my cross 
 What a joy it is to give my life away to you 
 All that I need, 
 All that I seek 
 Is You here with me 
 Holy Spirit have Your way in me! 
 In times of trouble, though trials may come 
 The rock of ages is standing strong 
 I'm fighting battles, but the war is won 
 So I'll run to you and surrender all 
 As I lay down my life 
 And pick up my cross 
 What a joy it is to give my life away to you 
 All that I need, 
 All that I seek 
 Is You here with me 
 Holy Spirit have Your way in me! 
 More of You and less of me, God 
 More of You and less of me, God 
 More of You and less of me, God 
 More of You overflowing 
 As I lay down my life 
 And pick up my cross 
 What a joy it is to give my life away to you 
 All that I need, 
 All that I seek 
 Is You here with me 
 Holy Spirit have Your way in me! 
 Holy Spirit have Your way in me!

Lifting hands in song and dance 
 Humbled by the glory of the cross 
 We've been redeemed and reconciled 
 Caught up in the splendor of it all 
 Eternal life You gave 
 So we will bring song of praise 
 How wonderful 
 How lovely is Your name 
 You captivate our hearts 
 You save us by Your grace 
 God of mercy, God of love 
 How we marvel at Your majesty 
 As we kneel before Your holy throne 
 In the beauty of Your mystery 
 We are children of the King 
 Father, of Your love we sing 
 And You are 
 Closer than a brother, Jesus 
 Closer than a brother, Jesus 
 Oh, the name of Jesus 
 Oh, the name of Jesus 
 Oh, the name of Jesus

Staring at the glow of the city lights 
 In the land of the rising sun 
 You hear the cries from the hearts of everyone 
 An ocean apart from my town tonight 
 But I know I'm not alone 
 I feel You just as close a thousand miles from home 
 I can see Your love, I can see Your love all around 
 Everywhere I go, everywhere 
 It's surrounding 
 I can feel Your heart, I can feel Your heart 
 Beating for us now 
 Sinking my feet in the muddy ground 
 Lifting my face in the rain 
 I see Your kingdom in the middle of hunger and pain 
 I feel You in the hands of the poor 
 I hear You in the song of the weak 
 There is no place too far that You can't reach 
 I see it in the sun 
 I see it in the sky 
 Your glory's everywhere 
 Your love is alive 
 I see it in Your Son 
 I see it when He died 
 I see it when He rose 
 Your love is alive 
 Oh yeah, Your love is alive 
 Could we with ink the ocean fill 
 And were the skies of paper made 
 Every tree on earth a quill 
 And every man a scribe by trade 
 To write the love of God above 
 Would drain the ocean dry 
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole 
 Though stretched from sky to sky 
 Oh love of God, how rich and pure 
 How measureless and strong 
 It shall forevermore endure 
 The saints and angels songs 
 Oh love of God, how rich and pure 
 How measureless and strong 
 It shall forevermore endure

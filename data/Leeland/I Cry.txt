Fear is far from love 
 And I feel scared enough 
 To think You've given up on me 
 But I can't hide my shame 
 You know my deepest pain 
 You are well acquainted with my grief 
 Oh great God of power 
 I have lost my strength 
 This is my desperate hour 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 I cry 
 Are You out there tonight 
 Or am I all alone? 
 This time it's the fight of my life 
 So I cry 
 I can't do this on my own 
 I can't do this on my own 
 I am giving You control 
 If weakness is a crown 
 Then I kneel before You now 
 And lay it at Your feet as an offering 
 And if You hold everything 
 Then don't let go of me 
 Hide me in the shadow of Your wings 
 Oh great God of power 
 I have lost my strength 
 This is my desperate hour 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 Are You out there tonight 
 Are You out there tonight 
 Are You out there tonight 
 So I cry 
 Are You out there tonight? 
 (You said You'd never leave me) 
 Are You out there tonight? 
 (You said You'd never leave me) 
 Are You out there tonight? 
 (You said You'd never leave me) 
 So I cry 
 I can't do this on my own 
 I can't do this on my own 
 I can't do this on my own 
 I can't do this alone 
 I can't do this 
 I'm holding on to You 
 I'm holding on to You 
 I'm holding on 
 I'm holding on to You 
 God, I'm holding on to You 
 Lord, I'm holding on

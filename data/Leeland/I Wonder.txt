At the stars in the night, I wonder 
 At Your lightning in the sky, I shudder 
 Your glory is a blanket that covers 
 Every living thing 
 I'm in awe at the majesty of who You are 
 Your love is a seal burnt inside my heart 
 All of the day I want to be where You are 
 Holy Father 
 And it feels like there's not enough praise inside of me 
 With all these words, all my heart can sing is holy 
 You are holy 
 Jesus Christ 
 You bled Your love, laid down Yourself 
 And gave me life 
 In naked shame You hung and You were lifted high 
 Here I lay in awe and wonder 
 I am afraid 
 For no one's ever sacrificed and loved me this way 
 So on my face I fall under Your heavy grace 
 Here I lay in awe and wonder 
 And I wonder 
 I'm in awe at the majesty of who You are 
 Your love is a seal burnt inside my heart 
 All of the day I want to be where You are 
 Holy Father 
 And it feels like there's not enough praise inside of me 
 With all these words, all my heart can sing is holy 
 You are holy

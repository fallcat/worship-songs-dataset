They say what you see is you get 
 There's more to life than meets the eye 
 You don't believe what they don't understand 
 I've touched your hands I've felt your side 
 Close enough to whisper, to hear my cry 
 In the light of morning, in the dead of night 
 I see you standing in the wind and waves 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 I see you walking from an empty grave 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 You say to look for what I can not see 
 You are the light open my eyes 
 So many voices that are blinding me 
 I listen for your words of life 
 Close enough to whisper, to hear my cry 
 In the light of morning, in the dead of night 
 I see you standing in the wind and waves 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 I see you walking from an empty grave 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 I see you standing in the wind and waves 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 I see you walking from an empty grave 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 Close enough to whisper, to hear my cry 
 In the light of morning, in the dead of night 
 Close enough to whisper, to hear my cry 
 In the light of morning, in the dead of night 
 I see you standing in the wind and waves 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 I see you walking from an empty grave 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 I see you standing in the wind and waves 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 I see you walking from an empty grave 
 I'm never alone, You're not invisible, no 
 You're not invisible, no

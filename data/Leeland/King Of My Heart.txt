Here underneath 
 Your covering 
 Inside Your wings 
 I, I am renewed 
 By grace and truth 
 I'll follow You 
 My Lord 
 For I have, I have 
 I have fallen in love 
 You are all I'm living and breathing for 
 Every day, every night 
 I have fallen in love 
 I'm giving You my hopes and dreams, everything 
 All my time, for You are mine 
 I have fallen in love 
 You are, You are, You are 
 You're the king of my heart, my heart 
 I have fallen in love 
 Come have Your way 
 Love invade 
 Every single space 
 In my heart 
 For I have, I have 
 I have fallen in love 
 You are all I'm living and breathing for 
 Every day, every night 
 I have fallen in love 
 I'm giving You my hopes and dreams, everything 
 All my time, for You are mine 
 I have fallen in love 
 You are, You are, You are 
 You're the king of my heart, my heart 
 I have fallen in love 
 All my future, my hope 
 All my heart and my soul 
 All that I need to know 
 Is nothing less than You love me 
 All my future, my hope 
 All my heart and my soul 
 All that I need to know 
 Is nothing less than You love me 
 Nothing less than You love me 
 I have, I have 
 I have fallen in love 
 I have, I have 
 I have fallen in love 
 You are all I'm living and breathing for 
 Every day, every night 
 I have fallen in love 
 I'm giving You my hopes and dreams, everything 
 All my time, for You are mine 
 I have fallen in love 
 You are, You are, You are 
 You're the king of my heart, my heart 
 I have fallen in love 
 You're the king of my heart 
 My heart, my heart

We're living to fast 
 Caught up in satisfaction 
 We're missing so much 
 Don't even know we're disconnected 
 But Where is the love that makes us stronger 
 Binds the hearts of every color 
 In the end we are all God's children 
 We gotta Learn To Love 
 Need action for resolution 
 We need a revolution 
 Need to come close to each other 
 One love of sisters and brother 
 But Where is the love that makes us stronger 
 Binds the hearts of every color 
 In the end we are all God's children 
 We gotta Learn To 
 Pray for each other 
 Stand in together 
 We'll see his kingdom come 
 Shinning like the sun 
 Something is stirring 
 A new day is calling 
 Jesus Is the king 
 We lift our voice and sing 
 But Where is the love that makes us stronger 
 Binds the hearts of every color 
 In the end we are all God's children 
 We gotta Learn To Love 
 In the end we are all God's children 
 We gotta Learn To Love 
 We gotta Learn to Love x8

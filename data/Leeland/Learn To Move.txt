On the corner of Fifth Street, 
 The homeless man needs to eat 
 On the edge of town 
 Lost his family long ago 
 Nobody even knows 
 They all just pass him by 
 But love is on the move, 
 Revealing heaven's truth! 
 Love is on it's way and it will find him 
 In a high rise building, 
 The rich man has everything 
 But the letter has reached his sin 
 Hasn't talked to his kids on weeks, 
 He and his wife don't even speak 
 Nobody even knows 
 But love is on the move 
 Revealing heaven's truth 
 Love is on it's way and it will find him 
 Anyone can run 
 Into the arms of God 
 Love is on it's way and it will find you 
 And all the world cries for healing 
 The deepest longing for the love of God 
 And oh! The greatest mystery, 
 Love has come to save us 
 In the little quiet town 
 The Hope of the world was found 
 Under the night sky 
 He died and rose again 
 The Sacrifice that conquered sin 
 And now are his feet, his hands 
 Love is on the move 
 Revealing Heavens truth 
 Love is on it's way and it will find you 
 And anyone can run 
 Into the arms of God 
 Love is on it's way and it will find you 
 Oh anyone can run 
 Into the arms of God 
 Love is on it's way and it will find you 
 It will find you! 
 It will find you!

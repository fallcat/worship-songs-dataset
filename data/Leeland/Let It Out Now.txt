It's like you got to walk like him 
 Got to talk like her 
 Got to be like them 
 Everybody knows you follow the crowd 
 Or get singled out 
 But God says who you are 
 Not the world or movie stars 
 Don't you know He holds the answers in His hands? 
 We're stuck in a system 
 Is there anybody different? 
 Is anybody listening? 
 Is anybody listening? 
 Everyone has their own sound 
 Let it out now, let it out now 
 There's nothing wrong with living loud 
 Let it out now, let it out now 
 I'm drawing the line between 
 Being them or being me 
 I'm not ashamed 
 To call myself one of Yours, Lord 
 But it's a narrow path 
 I've got to break from the pack 
 No turning back 
 No turning back 
 Yes, God's looking for a people 
 With a passion in their hearts 
 We're God's children 
 We need to shine bright 
 We need to shine bright 
 Everyone has their own sound 
 Don't you know all God's children have their sound?

It feels like your world's crashing down 
 And solid ground is hard to be found 
 Feels like the walls are closing in 
 And night has fallen 
 And the sun is gone 
 Your heart is right 
 You need some time to find God 
 Come on, come on 
 Lift your eyes up, lift your eyes up to the hills 
 Even as the testing fire 
 God supplies every need in your life 
 And He'll come like the morning star 
 And wipe away your heart's fears 
 And the dark will fall 
 And light will shine 
 It's all all right with God here 
 Come on, come on 
 Lift your eyes up, lift your eyes up to the hills 
 Come on, come on 
 Lift your eyes up, lift your eyes up to the hills 
 Yeah, the sun will shine 
 It's a holy day, it's a brighter day for you 
 The sun, it will shin 
 It's a holy day, it's a brighter day for you 
 Come on, come on 
 Lift your eyes up 
 Come on, come on 
 Come on, come on 
 Come on, come on 
 Come on, come on, yeah 
 Come on, come on 
 Lift your eyes up, lift your eyes up to the hills 
 Come on, come on 
 Lift your eyes up, lift your eyes up to the hills

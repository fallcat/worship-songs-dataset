You can look in your head and find no answer 
 You can look in your heart and find no hope 
 And you can crawl on the ocean floor 
 Searching for the silver pearl 
 But you won't find the treasure in this world 
 You can lift your eyes 
 Come on to the cross 
 There is healing for all who come 
 You can look at the stars and make no sense of it 
 (Staring at the sky) 
 You can search your soul and find no light 
 Until you look in the Savior's eyes 
 And then you finally realize 
 The saving sacrifice is love divine 
 Come on and lift your eyes 
 Lift your eyes, come to the cross 
 Come one, come all

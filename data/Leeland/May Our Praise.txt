May our praise 
 Be all that you can hear 
 From our lives to your ears, Father 
 Wondrous King 
 You are clothed in mystery 
 Your hands set people free 
 Father 
 All pain is over 
 As your love draws us closer 
 Your grace goes on forever 
 So we sing 
 So we sing 
 Every heart should feel 
 The depth of your mercy 
 How beautiful is your healing 
 Father 
 And teach us lord 
 To attract you even more 
 We just want to be where you are 
 Be where you are 
 This is our love song to you 
 Father our love song to you 
 We never deserved 
 This never ending peace 
 You're a God who protects the weak 
 So we sing 
 So we sing

Standing at the gate of love 
 Waiting for the life of the Son 
 To follow me 'til I am undone 
 Oh, you pulled me out of the mud 
 Up from the miry clay 
 You washed all my sins away 
 I've been redeemed 
 I am a new creation 
 I have been born again 
 I'm here in the world 
 But my home is in a heavenly place 
 Far above the stars out in space 
 I'm not afraid 
 Death where is your sting 
 Hell will never conquer me 
 A love pure and holy 
 Has set me free 
 And I am a new creation 
 I have been born again 
 I am a new creation 
 I have been born again 
 For behold! The old has passed away! 
 There's a hole inside of me 
 And I'll never run away from you! 
 Anymore, anymore 
 I am a new creation 
 I have been born again 
 I am a new creation 
 I have been born again 
 The old has passed away and the new has come! 
 I am a new creation 
 I have been born again!

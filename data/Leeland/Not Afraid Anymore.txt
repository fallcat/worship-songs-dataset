I feel Your lightning waking me up 
 From the sleep of my timid soul 
 I've been in hiding from all Your plans 
 Your command that told me to go 
 And I've spent all my life keeping my head down 
 But I'm lifting up my eyes 
 I raise my flag up high, my flag up high 
 I'm not afraid anymore 
 'Cause I am running with Your fire, Lord 
 I'm picking up my sword 
 You train my hands and my fingers for war 
 I'm not afraid anymore 
 I hear the trumpet ringing out in these streets 
 Where kingdoms collide 
 So I'm responding 
 This is a fight for love, this is death or life 
 And when my knees are weak 
 I know Your hands are strong 
 And they are holding me 
 I'll never be alone, never be alone 
 You're chasing my fears away 
 There's no reason to be afraid 
 Your love is here chasing my fears away 
 Your love is here chasing my fears away

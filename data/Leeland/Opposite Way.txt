Living in the same town 
 For all these years 
 Doing the same old things 
 Hanging with the same crowd 
 And it's starting to get crippling 
 You've never felt in place 
 And you tell yourself it's all okay 
 But something's different today 
 You want to run the opposite way 
 And it seems like you're locked in a cage 
 And you need to find a way of escape 
 When everyone is setting the pace 
 It's okay to run the opposite way 
 The Father sent His Son down 
 The light of men 
 The cross He bore was crippling 
 Rejected in His own town 
 They couldn't see the sun shining 
 He knelt in the garden and prayed 
 Father, let this cup pass from me 
 It's not Your will for me to stay 
 Your will for me is the opposite way 
 And it seemed like He was locked in a cage 
 And He couldn't find away of escape 
 But through the cross He conquered the grave 
 My Jesus ran the opposite way 
 Oh, and through the cross He conquered the grave 
 Oh, He ran the opposite way 
 Yeah, through the cross He conquered the grave 
 So you could run the opposite way

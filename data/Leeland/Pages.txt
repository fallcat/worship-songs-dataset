When I stand before God's throne 
 Nothing hidden, nothing unknown 
 Dead to my body, my old life He took 
 God will hold in His hands my days in a book 
 When I kneel down that day 
 Looking upon His holy face 
 I will remember with trembling 
 Every single moment, every memory 
 Who was I and where was I going? 
 What kind of fruit were my actions growing? 
 Staring at the pages 
 He'll be staring at the pages of my life 
 Was my passion just to know Him? 
 Did I really let it out and show Him? 
 Staring at the pages 
 He'll be staring at the pages of my life 
 This house I'm building every day 
 Silver and gold, straw and the hay 
 Tried by fire 
 Will it stand when the flame gets higher 
 Or will it burn away? 
 In Your presence I belong 
 And without You, I am lost 
 Come and change me from the inside 
 In my weakness, You are strong 
 By the power of the cross 
 Come and change me from the inside 
 Who am I and where am I going? 
 What kind of fruit are my actions growing? 
 Staring at the pages 
 You are staring at the pages of my life 
 Is my passion just to know You? 
 Am I living this life to show You? 
 Staring at the pages 
 You are staring at the pages of my life

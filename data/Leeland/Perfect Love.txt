I ran away from home 
 You loved me, Lord 
 I traded you for gold 
 You loved me, Lord 
 Lived like I'd never known 
 That You loved me, Lord 
 I stayed away in shame 
 You ran to me 
 I wandered back afraid 
 You ran to me 
 I looked at You amazed 
 You ran to me 
 Your love had never changed 
 You ran to me 
 Your perfect love 
 Your perfect love casts out all fear, casts out all fear 
 Your perfect love 
 Your perfect love casts out all fear, casts out all fear 
 You never stop chasing us 
 You never stop chasing us 
 With Your redeeming love 
 You never stop chasing us 
 Your perfect love, Your perfect love 
 Casts out all fear 
 You saw what we'd become 
 You loved us Lord 
 You sent your only Son 
 You loved us Lord 
 We nailed You to a cross 
 You loved us Lord 
 Not that we loved You first 
 You Loved us Lord 
 Love You're a fighter 
 You hold us tighter 
 Than we wanna let go 
 You'll never let go 
 You never stop chasing 
 The ones You love 
 Now we're singing the song 
 You've been singing to us

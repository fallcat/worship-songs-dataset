He's coming for a pure bride. [x2] 
 See Him riding in the skies, 
 See the fire inside His eyes. 
 Through the darkness His light will shine, 
 In His glory, He's lifted high. 
 He's coming for a pure bride. [x3] 
 See Him riding in the skies, 
 See the fire inside His eyes. 
 Through the darkness His light will shine, 
 In His glory, He's lifted high. 
 He's coming for a pure bride. 
 The Lord is coming for His bride, 
 Make way for the Lord. 
 He's clothing all His children in white, 
 Make way for the Lord. 
 (x2) 
 Make way for the Lord. 
 What are you doing when no one is watching? 
 What are you doing? 
 Children get your hearts right, 
 God's coming for a pure bride. 
 Children get your hearts right.

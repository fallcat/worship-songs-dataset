Here in this place 
 With humbleness and brokenness 
 We seek all You are 
 We seek You 
 And it's for You 
 It's all for You 
 We're leaping over walls to get to You 
 Would You pull us along 
 Pull us home 
 We are 
 We are reaching 
 We are reaching out 
 (And we're calling for You, Lord) 
 We're caught up in this hunger 
 Searching for Your heart 
 (And we're calling for You, Lord) 
 Here on this earth 
 We lift our eyes to the stars 
 We seek all You are 
 We seek You 
 And it's for You 
 It's all for you 
 We're breaking off our chains to run to You 
 Would you fill our hearts 
 Oh, fill our songs 
 Leaving the lights on, the lights on 
 We wait for you 
 This won't be the last song, the last song 
 We sing to you 
 We are 
 We are reaching 
 We are reaching out 
 (And we're calling for You, Lord)

In my sorrows the depths of my despair 
 Under burdens that only You could bear 
 When I had all but given up, I saw love 
 In the shadows blinded and afraid 
 With the debt that only You could pay 
 In the darkness broken and undone 
 I saw love 
 When the Son was lifted up I felt new breath inside my lungs 
 When the Son was lifted up I saw my shame where He was hung 
 When the Son was lifted up I heard His voice crying "It's done" 
 I saw love 
 Stripped and beaten, nailed upon a tree 
 In my place, He drank the cup for me 
 Flowing down, the water and the blood 
 I saw love 
 When the Son was lifted up I felt new breath inside my lungs 
 When the Son was lifted up I saw my shame where He was hung 
 When the Son was lifted up I heard His voice crying "It's done" 
 I saw love 
 When the Son was lifted up I saw the stone was rolled away 
 And the chains that held my heart He left inside that empty grave 
 When the Son was lifted up I looked upon my Savior's face 
 I saw love, I saw love 
 King of Love 
 You have won my heart 
 King of Love 
 You have won my heart 
 King of Love 
 You have won my heart 
 King of Love 
 You have won my heart

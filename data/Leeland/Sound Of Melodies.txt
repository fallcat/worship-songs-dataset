We who were called to be Your people 
 Struggling sinners and thieves 
 We're lifted up from the ashes 
 And out came the song of the redeemed 
 The song of the redeemed 
 The song of the redeemed 
 Can you hear the sound of melodies 
 Oh, the sound of melodies 
 Rising up to You 
 Rising up to You, God 
 The sound of melodies 
 Oh, the sound of melodies 
 Rising up to You 
 Rising up to You, God 
 We have caught a revelation 
 That nothing can separate us from 
 The love we received through salvation 
 It fills your daughters and your sons 
 Your daughters and your sons 
 The sound of Your love 
 The sound of Your love 
 Is what You're hearing 
 The sound of Your sons 
 The sound of Your sons 
 You've won Your children 
 The sound of Your love 
 The sound of Your love 
 Is what You're hearing 
 Your daughters in love 
 Your daughters in love 
 You've won your children 
 The sound of melodies 
 Oh, the sound of melodies 
 Rising up to You 
 Rising up to You, God

There are many prodigal sons 
 On our city streets they run 
 Searching for shelter 
 There are homes broken down 
 People's hopes have fallen to the ground 
 From failures 
 This is an emergency! 
 There are tears from the saints 
 For the lost and unsaved 
 We're crying for them come back home 
 We're crying for them come back home 
 And all your children will stretch out their hands 
 And pick up the crippled man 
 Father, we will lead them home 
 Father, we will lead them home 
 There are schools full of hatred 
 Even churches have forsaken 
 Love and mercy 
 May we see this generation 
 In it's state of desperation 
 For Your glory 
 This is an emergency! 
 Sinner, reach out your hands! 
 Children in Christ you stand! 
 Sinner, reach out your hands! 
 Children in Christ you stand! 
 And all Your children will stretch out their hands 
 And pick up the crippled man 
 Father, we will lead them home 
 Father, we will lead them home

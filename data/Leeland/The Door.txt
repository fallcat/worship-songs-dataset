As the rain falls from Heaven, I'm lost in Your love, 
 You're overwhelming, Jesus. 
 And we're walking together, holding hands, 
 Oh, it's just You and me, Jesus. 
 Life is good here, fruit is growing 
 On the beautiful branches. 
 There is rest and there is peace 
 Inside the shade of Your garden. 
 Jesus, You're the only one for me, 
 There's no way I'm leaving You. 
 You're the love, the way, the life, the truth, 
 You're the door I'm walking through. 
 Angels are lifting songs of praise, 
 Oh, they're just singing Your story. 
 And nothing can take me away from this place, 
 Lord, I'm just lost in Your glory. 
 Your love is the reason that I am free, 
 Oh, and I'm running to You 'cause you're all I need. 
 Jesus, You're the only one for me, 
 There's no way I'm leaving You. 
 You're the love, the way, the life, the truth, 
 You're the door I'm walking through. 
 You're the only one for me, 
 There's no way I'm leaving You. 
 You're the love, the way, the life, the truth, 
 You're the door I'm walking through. 
 And Jesus, You're the only one for me, 
 There's no way I'm leaving You. 
 Hey! 
 As the rain falls from Heaven, I'm lost in Your love, 
 You're overwhelming, Jesus. 
 You're the only one for me, 
 There's no way I'm leaving You. 
 You're the love, the way, the life, the truth, 
 You're the door I'm walking through. 
 Jesus, You're the only one for me, 
 There's no way I'm leaving You.

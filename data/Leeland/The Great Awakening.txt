One man wakes, awakens another 
 Second one wakes his next door brother 
 Three awake can rouse a town 
 And turn the whole place upside down 
 Many awake will cause such a fuss 
 It finally awakes all of us 
 One man wakes with dawn in his eyes 
 Surely then it multiplies 
 Surely then it multiplies 
 One man wakes, awakens another 
 Second one wakes his next door brother 
 Three awake can rouse a town 
 And turn the whole place upside down 
 Many awake will cause such a fuss 
 It finally awakes all of us 
 One man wakes with dawn in his eyes 
 Surely then it multiplies 
 Surely then it multiplies 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 One man wakes, awakens another 
 Second one wakes his next door brother 
 Three awake can rouse a town 
 And turn the whole place upside down 
 Many awake will cause such a fuss 
 It finally awakes all of us 
 One man wakes with dawn in his eyes 
 Surely then it multiplies 
 Surely then it multiplies 
 Surely then it multiplies 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Sing it for his next door brother! 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
 One man wakes, awakens another 
 Second one wakes his next door brother 
 Three awake can rouse a town 
 And turn the whole place upside down 
 Many awake will cause such a fuss 
 It finally awakes all of us 
 One man wakes with dawn in his eyes 
 Surely then it multiplies...

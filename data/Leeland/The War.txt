The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want 
 You lead me in the paths of Your righteousness 
 In these green pastures I'll sing a song 
 I will fear no evil in life or death 
 Though my enemies rise against me 
 I know that you are with me 
 I know that You are always for me 
 You're fighting all my battles 
 So I'm standing in your victory 
 You prepare a table 
 In the presence of my enemies 
 You've already won the war 
 The Lord is my warrior 
 My sun and shield 
 Your word is the sword that shatters fear 
 You watch over me and count my steps 
 Your love and affection so furious 
 Your voice thunders from the heavens 
 Breaking through this desert 
 Shouting I am your defender 
 The battle's not mine but Yours

Great is your love and your faithfulness 
 It's your faithfulness that carries me 
 Many times I've run away 
 Forsook your love and all your grace 
 Still you call out my name 
 Yeah you still care that I be saved 
 So I'll sing the glories of your name 
 You're awesomeness I will proclaim 
 Until you come until you come 
 And take your bride away 
 Like a thief in the night 
 Like a thief in the night 
 You'll take us away 
 There is no one that can fill this void 
 Like you fill this void in my heart 
 My life is just a human one 
 But You pick me up and call me son 
 Speak Lord I'm listening 
 Yes Your child will serve faithfully 
 Like a thief in the night

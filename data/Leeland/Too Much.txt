All these places I have been 
 All these faces I have seen 
 Too much, too much 
 All these bricks and all these stones 
 Have all been cast they've all been thrown 
 Too hard, too hard 
 Find me in the background looking down 
 You'll never see my face 
 I'm looking down 
 I need a place a sanctuary 
 A refuge for my ordinary 
 Finally familiar peaceful home 
 Untroubled safe from all this madness 
 Refuge for my hope and sadness 
 Possible to find myself alone 
 At home 
 All these cliffs and all these heights 
 They've just been too high to climb 
 Too high, too high 
 All these waves and all these seas 
 Have all been crashing down on me 
 Too much, too much 
 I've found my home again 
 I finally find myself in You 
 I finally find myself in You 
 I feel safe again 
 You're the one I'm running to 
 You're the one I'm running to

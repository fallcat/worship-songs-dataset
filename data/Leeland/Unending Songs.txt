Oh holy God, You are the melody 
 The cry that's ringing out of my heart 
 I came to life the day You died 
 My sin and shame were crucified on the cross 
 All that was lost I found in You 
 And I will sing unending songs 
 I will sing unending songs 
 I will sing unending songs 
 Holy are You, Lord 
 One true God, You met me in my nakedness 
 And covered me with love 
 My brokenness I lay before Your righteousness 
 In glory I am renewed, loved by You 
 Holy Father 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy are You, Lord 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy are You, Lord 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy are You 
 Holy are You, Lord

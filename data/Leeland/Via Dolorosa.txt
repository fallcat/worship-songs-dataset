He traded His crown for a crown of thorns, 
 He picked up His cross and laid down His sword. 
 He stumbled down the road, bruised and beaten for me, 
 Jesus walked the way of grief, hallelujah. 
 On the Via Dolorosa 
 All my sin was carried away. 
 And the power of Hell was broken 
 As He gave His life away. 
 He knew it was to come from the very start, 
 But His love for all the world beat inside His heart. 
 He climbed the road of suffering to the hill of Cavalry, 
 Where the saints would be redeemed, hallelujah. 
 On the Via Dolorosa 
 All my sin was carried away. 
 And the power of Hell was broken 
 As He gave His life away. 
 Jesus fixed His eyes upon the new horizon, 
 Soon He would rise and the world would be forgiven. 
 (x2) 
 Hallelujah, Jesus rose again. 
 On the cross He shed His blood on Calvary, 
 And I'm thankful for the journey of my King. 
 On the Via Dolorosa 
 All my sin was carried away. 
 And the power of Hell was broken 
 As He gave His life away. 
 Oh, as He gave His life away. 
 He traded His crown for a crown of thorns.

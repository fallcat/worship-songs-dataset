The nation lost and dying 
 Searching for You 
 Creation waits 
 Children with the word of God 
 Written on their hearts 
 Show love to the world 
 We need to wake up, wake up 
 Live like God 
 Pour out love 
 We need to wake up, wake up 
 Live like God 
 Pour out love 
 I know it's sad 
 That the gift we have 
 We keep it for ourselves 
 Most of the time 
 The world is looking 
 For a love that's locked up 
 Inside these four walls 
 Break the door down and shine 
 Our face is set 
 Our goal is heaven 
 Jesus, You are the well of love 
 We'll pour You out 
 We'll pour You out

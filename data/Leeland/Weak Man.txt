Jesus, give me your heart 
 Let there be a death in me 
 I'm making room for al that you are 
 Give me your heart 
 Jesus, give me your heart 
 Break me down, build me up 
 Let who I was keep falling apart 
 Give me your heart 
 My Creator 
 Oh, my Creator 
 May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher 
 May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher 
 And I'll be weak, for you are strong, weak, for you are strong 
 In the weak man 
 Jesus, give me your heart 
 Burn away all the drugs 
 Come on, let the fire start 
 Give me your heart 
 My Creator 
 Oh, my Creator 
 May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher 
 May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher 
 And I'll be weak, for you are strong, weak, for you are strong 
 In the weak man 
 I want to make you higher 
 Lord, it's my heart's desire 
 I want to make you higher 
 May I be low, low so you're made higher 
 May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher 
 And I'll be weak, for you are strong, weak, for you are strong 
 May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher 
 May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher 
 And I'll be weak, for you are strong, weak, for you are strong 
 Weak, for you are strong 
 In the weak man 
 In the weak man

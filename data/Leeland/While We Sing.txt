I've sat by far too long 
 And I've watched the hurting suffer on their own 
 I have chances every day 
 To live like You, die to myself 
 Give Your love away 
 And I wonder why I feel so empty inside 
 While I sing la la la la la la la la la 
 As the hungry roam the streets 
 La la la la la la la la la 
 As the broken are on their knees 
 La la la la la la la la la 
 I keep singing 
 We are frozen, we are still 
 But we're called to be a city on a hill 
 And as our melodies resound 
 We cannot hear the silent cry 
 This world is screaming out 
 And we wonder why we feel so empty inside 
 While we sing la la la la la la la la la 
 As the hungry roam the streets 
 La la la la la la la la la 
 As the broken are on their knees 
 La la la la la la la la la 
 We keep singing 
 Remember salvation's day 
 When Jesus washed our sins away 
 The lost are crying out to be saved 
 While we sing la la la la la la la la la 
 As the hungry roam the streets 
 La la la la la la la la la 
 As the broken are on their knees 
 La la la la la la la la la 
 We keep singing 
 But just a song won't heal 
 The bleeding wound 
 Church wake up 
 We're sleeping in an empty tomb 
 Church arise, arise and shine 
 Shake yourself from the dust 
 God is calling us to go

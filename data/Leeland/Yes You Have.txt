Every tree and every stone 
 Every rushing wind that moans 
 They sing Your praise 
 My God, they sing Your praise 
 Every star and open sky 
 Tell of Your glory divine 
 They shout Your praise 
 They shout Your praise, yeah 
 You've stolen my heart 
 Yes, You have! 
 You've stolen my heart 
 Yes, You have! 
 You've wiped away the stains 
 And broke away the chains 
 Yes, You have! 
 With Your love You set me free 
 Three nails gave me liberty 
 So I'll sing Your praise 
 My God, I'll sing Your praise 
 Oh, with Your love 
 You forgave my sin 
 Forgot my past 
 And brought me back again 
 So I'll sing Your praise 
 I'll sing Your praise, yeah 
 If I ascend into the sky 
 Or hide behind the night 
 I can not run Your love is chasing me 
 If I fall into the sea 
 Your hand will rescue me 
 No one will take Your place 
 Because 
 This is all for You 
 Yes, this is all for You 
 You're the King of the world 
 You're the King of the world

You called me Lord 
 You know my name 
 I'm standing now 
 I'm not ashamed 
 You are the Lord of all I am 
 I'll never be the same again 
 I've searched and came up empty 
 This world has nothing for me 
 You are my One and only 
 I'm living my life for You 
 I'm giving everything to You 
 Not holding back but every part 
 I'm giving it all to You

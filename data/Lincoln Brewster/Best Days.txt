I'm running a race that I'm not gonna lose 
 'Cause everything changed when I met You 
 So I'm laying all my tomorrows in Your hands 
 I'm standing on every word You've said 
 I'm holding onto Your promises 
 And I know my hope and my future are found in You 
 With everything that You've started in me 
 I believe that You will be faithful 
 And I receive everything that You're doing in me 
 And I believe that the rest of my life 
 Will be the best days of my life 
 I'm waking to find Your mercies new 
 I'm walking upon Your grace and truth 
 And I know Your Spirit will lead me on my way 
 I'm giving away this life I have 
 I'll give it my all, Lord I won't hold back 
 'Til I stand before You in Heaven, finally home 
 With everything that You've started in me 
 I believe that You will be faithful 
 And I receive everything that You're doing in me 
 And I believe that the rest of my life 
 Will be the best days of my life 
 You pulled me out from where I was 
 And You set my feet on a solid rock 
 You've given me a brand new song to sing 
 So I won't fear, You'll see me through 
 The darkness is as light to You 
 And I know You're gonna make 
 The night shine like the day, and I believe it 
 I know You're coming back for me 
 I'll be living for eternity 
 Because of what You've done for me 
 I know that the rest of my life 
 Will be the best days of my life 
 I receive everything that You're doing in me 
 And I believe that the rest of my life 
 Will be the best of my life 
 I know You're coming back for me 
 Yes, I'm living for eternity 
 Because of what You've done for me 
 Now I know that the rest of my life 
 Will be the best days of my life

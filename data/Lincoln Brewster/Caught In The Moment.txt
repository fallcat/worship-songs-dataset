Every mornin' praise I sing to Thee 
 You're slow to wrath and swift to bless my soul 
 Your love endures unchanging, oh Hallelujah 
 Cover me with Your grace 
 Shine on me with Your light 
 Take Your arms, hold me tight 
 Keep me caught in the moment 
 Cover me with Your grace 
 Shine on me with Your light 
 Take Your arms, hold me tight 
 Keep me caught in the moment 
 Every night I pray myself to sleep 
 I look to You and plead, my soul You'll keep, yeah 
 You endure unchanging, oh Hallelujah 
 Cover me with Your grace 
 Shine on me with Your light 
 Take Your arms, hold me tight 
 Keep me caught in the moment 
 Cover me with Your grace 
 Shine on me with Your light 
 Take Your arms, hold me tight 
 Keep me caught in the moment 
 Cover me with Your grace 
 Shine on me with Your light 
 Take Your arms, hold me tight 
 Keep me caught in the moment, yeah 
 You've opened my eyes 
 Now the mystery is clear to me 
 That in You and You alone 
 I find the love that sets me free 
 You've opened my eyes 
 Now the mystery is clear to me, oh yeah 
 That in You and You alone 
 I find the love that sets me free 
 That in You alone 
 Cover me with Your grace 
 Shine on me with Your light 
 Take Your arms, hold me tight 
 Keep me caught in the moment 
 Cover me with Your grace 
 Shine on me with Your light 
 Take Your arms, hold me tight 
 Keep me caught in the moment 
 Caught in the moment 
 Caught in the moment 
 Caught in the moment

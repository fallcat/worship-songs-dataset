What to say Lord it's 
 You Who gave me life 
 And I can't explain 
 Just how Much You mean to me 
 Now that You have saved me Lord 
 I give all that I am to You 
 That every day I can 
 Be a light that shines Your name 
 Every day Lord 
 I'll learn to stand upon Your Word 
 And I pray that I might 
 Come to know You more 
 Won't You guide me in 
 Every single step I take and 
 Every day I will 
 Be Your light unto the world 
 Every day it's You I live for 
 Every day I'll follow after You 
 Every day I'll walk with You my Lord 
 It's You I live for every day 
 It's You I live for every day 
 It's You I live for every day

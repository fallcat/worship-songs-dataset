What to say Lord it's You Who gave me life 
 And I can't explain 
 Just how Much You mean to me 
 Now that You have saved me Lord 
 I give all that I am to You 
 That everyday I will 
 Be a light that shines Your name 
 Everyday Lord I'll learn to stand upon Your Word 
 And I pray that I, that I might 
 Come to know You more 
 You will guide me in 
 Every single step I take and 
 Everyday I will be a light unto the world 
 Everyday it's You I live for 
 Everyday I'll follow after You 
 Everyday I'll walk with You my Lord 
 It's You I live for everyday 
 It's You I live for everyday 
 It's You I live for everyday

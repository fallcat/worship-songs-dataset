I will praise with all I am 
 Every fiber of my soul 
 Every breath I'll ever take 
 Is because You made it so 
 And I will give You all I am 
 Every minute, every hour 
 And You fill me with Your love 
 With Your strength and with Your power 
 Oh, God above, Your love has opened up my eyes 
 Now all I see is You, all I see is You 
 Everywhere I go, Your love surrounds me 
 Everywhere I turn, Your grace reminds me 
 Nothing in this world can separate us now 
 Every step I take, You're there to guide me 
 Everyday I wake, Your mercy finds me 
 Nothing in this world can ever take this love away 
 You will never let me go 
 Lord, Your love has won my heart 
 And I want the world to know 
 Just how wonderful You are 
 So I am running after You 
 Everyday that I have breath 
 Jesus, You're the only way 
 And there's no way I'm turning back 
 Oh, God above, Your love has opened up my eyes 
 Now all I see is You, all I see is You 
 Oh, with every breath, I breathe, I know it's true now 
 And everywhere I go, Your love surrounds me 
 Everywhere I turn, Your grace reminds me 
 Nothing in this world can separate us now 
 Every step I take, You're there to guide me 
 Everyday I wake, Your mercy finds me 
 Nothing in this world can ever take this love away 
 And I won't look back, I won't worry 
 'Cause my best days are before me 
 No, I won't look back, I won't worry 
 'Cause my best days are before me 
 No, I won't look back, I won't worry, no 
 'Cause my best days are before me 
 No, I won't look back, I won't worry, no 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 Oh, God above, Your love has opened up my eyes 
 Now all I see is You, all I see is You 
 And everywhere I go, Your love surrounds me 
 Everywhere I turn, Your grace reminds me 
 Nothing in the world can separate us now 
 Every step I take, You're there to guide me 
 Everyday I wake, Your mercy finds me 
 Nothing in the world can ever take this love away 
 Everywhere I go, Your love surrounds me 
 Everywhere I turn, Your grace reminds me 
 Nothing in the world can separate us now 
 (Nothing's gonna separate us now) 
 Every step I take You're there to guide me 
 Everyday I wake Your mercy finds me 
 Nothing in the world can ever take this love away 
 (Nothing's gonna separate us now) 
 Everywhere I go, Your love surrounds me 
 Everywhere I turn, Your grace reminds me 
 Everywhere I go, Your love surrounds me 
 Every step I take, You're there to guide me 
 Your mercy finds me

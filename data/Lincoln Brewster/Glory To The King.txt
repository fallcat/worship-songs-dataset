No weapon formed against us shall prosper 
 Our enemies will not prevail 
 Through the lightning and the thunder 
 Your light will guide us as we sail 
 The music is gonna play 
 And God You will have Your way 
 The nations will stand and sing 
 Glory to the King 
 The lost will be drawn to You 
 Their eyes will see the truth 
 Then we will stand and sing 
 Glory to the King 
 We will stand as one in singing 
 We will live in harmony 
 We will live lives of compassion 
 Lord to You all praises be 
 Restore the joy of Your salvation 
 Let Your word renew our minds 
 Let Your glory rise among us 
 That Your name alone may be praised

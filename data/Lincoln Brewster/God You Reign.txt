You paint the night, You count the stars 
 And You call them by name 
 The skies proclaim, God, You reign 
 Your glory shines, You teach the sun 
 When to bring a new day 
 Creation sings, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 You part the seas, You move the mountains 
 With the words that You say 
 My song remains, God, You reign 
 You hold my life, You know my heart 
 And You call me by name 
 I live to say, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 I know You reign 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 Hallelujah, Hallelu, Hallelujah, Hallelu 
 Hallelujah, Hallelu, Hallelujah, Hallelu 
 God, God, You reign, God, You reign 
 You reign over me 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 Reign over me 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 God, You reign, God, You reign 
 (God, You reign, God, You reign) 
 Forever and ever, God, You reign 
 (God, You reign)

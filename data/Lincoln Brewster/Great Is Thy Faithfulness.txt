Great is Thy faithfulness 
 O God my Father 
 There is no shadow of turning with Thee 
 Thou changest not 
 Thy compassions they fail not 
 As Those hast been Thou forever will be 
 Great is Thy faithfulness 
 Great is Thy faithfulness 
 Morning by morning new mercies I see 
 All I have needed Thy hand hath provided 
 Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto me 
 Pardon for sin 
 And a peace that endureth 
 Thine own dear presence 
 To cheer and to guide 
 Strength for today 
 And bright hope for tomorrow 
 Blessings all mine 
 With ten thousand beside

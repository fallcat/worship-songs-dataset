We all like to hide behind our different faces 
 And we all like to pretend we're in different places 
 I don't need anyone to give me approval 
 And I don't mind if you laugh and call me a loser 
 'Cause He's all I need 
 To live, to be 
 He's my decree 
 He's all I ever need 
 We all like to brave our faith when misplace it 
 And we all like to call up too so when I make it 
 But you and me, we don't need to steal or borrow 
 'Cause we are kids of the King, of the great tomorrow 
 He's all I need 
 To live, to be 
 He's my decree 
 He's all I ever need 
 Open Him, trust in Him, reach for Him 
 Let the flood of God's tears drown the sea 
 That should've never beeen, never been 
 He's all I need 
 To live, to be 
 He's my decree 
 He's all I ever need

One heartbeat, one mind 
 One focus divine 
 One hope and one faith 
 One love that remains 
 You bring order where there's chaos 
 Nothing separates us 
 Your love 
 Your love is stirring in our souls 
 Unite our hearts 
 To beat for You alone 
 Fortify our hope 
 In the faithfulness You've shown 
 We give our all 
 To be Your hands and feet 
 Make our heartbeat Your heartbeat 
 One God and one grace 
 One passion unchained 
 One purpose, one life 
 One mission unified 
 You bring order where there's chaos 
 Nothing separates us 
 Your love 
 Your love is stirring in our souls 
 Unite our hearts 
 To beat for You alone 
 Fortify our hope 
 In the faithfulness You've shown 
 We give our all 
 To be Your hands and feet 
 Make our heartbeat Your heartbeat 
 Let us love like You love 
 With a heart that's broken 
 Let us give like You gave 
 With our arms wide open 
 Let us never forget 
 All the lost and lonely souls 
 Unite our hearts 
 To beat for You alone 
 Fortify our hope 
 In the faithfulness You've shown 
 We give our all 
 To be Your hands and feet 
 Make our heartbeat Your heartbeat

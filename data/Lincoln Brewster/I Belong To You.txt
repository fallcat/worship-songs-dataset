You light my way, everyday 
 You help me see, what I can be 
 I cry to You, my Spirit song 
 Come use my life, for You alone 
 You caught my soul, when I was struggling to breathe 
 You made me whole, and now Your majesty I see 
 I belong to You 
 Yes I belong to You 
 I hear Your voice, it leads me on 
 Into Your arms, where I belong 
 I cry to You, my Spirit song 
 Come use my life, for You alone 
 You caught my soul, when I was struggling to breathe 
 You made me whole, and now Your majesty I see 
 I belong to You 
 Yes I belong to You 
 I know You're everything 
 You're all I'll ever need 
 I know You're everything to me 
 I know You're everything 
 You're all I'll ever need 
 I know You're everything to me 
 I know You're everything 
 You're all I'll ever need 
 You caught my soul, when I was struggling to breathe 
 You made me whole, and now Your majesty I see 
 I belong to You 
 Yes I belong to You 
 I know You're everything to me

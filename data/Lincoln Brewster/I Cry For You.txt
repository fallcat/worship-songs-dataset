Day after day, my heart beats for You 
 Wanting You near beside me always 
 Lord, I won't fear as long as You're here 
 In my life, I need You always 
 I cry for You to heal me, forgive me 
 I cry for You to save me, to know me more 
 Day after day, my eyes long to see You 
 Show me Your face and hold me close in Your arms 
 I cry for You to heal me, forgive me 
 I cry for You to love me, to know me more 
 I cry for You to heal me, forgive me 
 I cry for You to save me, to know me more 
 I cry for You to heal me, to save me 
 And I cry for You to love me, forgive me 
 I cry for You to hear me, to save me 
 I love You be near me

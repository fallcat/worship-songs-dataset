Come on let's turn it up 
 We're gonna sing it out 
 For all the world to hear 
 There's love for everyone 
 A new day has began 
 Something to shout about 
 Let it be known 
 That our God saves 
 Our God reigns 
 We lift You up, up 
 Let it be known 
 That love has come 
 Love has won 
 We lift You up, up, up, oh 
 Nothing can stop us now 
 No one can keep us down 
 We've found our voice again 
 No need for fear and shame 
 There's power in His name 
 Come on let freedom reign 
 We lift Your name up 
 Higher and higher 
 We lift Your name up, Jesus 
 We shout Your name out 
 Louder and louder 
 We shout it out now

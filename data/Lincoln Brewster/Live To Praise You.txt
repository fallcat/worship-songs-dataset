Day after day 
 You never change 
 Ever the same 
 There is hope in Your name 
 You are the fire 
 That's burning bright 
 Ever You reign 
 So we're lifting You high 
 Everybody shout, make it loud 
 All of heaven sing, hear the sound 
 Let the praises ring, Your renown 
 Everyday we live 
 Everyday we live to praise You 
 Breath after breath 
 We're so alive 
 Ever we're changed 
 'Cause You rescued our lives 
 The First and the Last 
 No one in between 
 Ever the King 
 You're the song that we sing 
 The joy of the Lord is our strength

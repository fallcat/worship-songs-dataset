Lord I lift Your name on High 
 Lord I love to sing Your praises 
 I'm so glad You're in my life 
 I'm so glad You came to save us 
 You came from heaven to earth 
 To show the way 
 From the earth to the cross 
 My debt to pay 
 From the cross to the grave 
 From the grave to the sky 
 Lord I lift your name on high 
 Lord I lift your name on high 
 Lord of wonder and salvation 
 Whit our voice we magnify 
 The God of every generation 
 You came from heaven...

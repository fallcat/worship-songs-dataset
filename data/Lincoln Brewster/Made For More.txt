Don't care about money, don't care about fame 
 Not chasing some great accolade 
 Oh, I want more 
 I've never been much for flattery 
 So don't waste that kind of talk on me 
 Oh, I want more 
 More than this whole world can offer 
 More than all that time destroys 
 And all I've wanted here can't satisfy my wanting 
 'Cause I was made, made for more 
 Well, I've climbed as high as status goes 
 But I've got social vertigo 
 Oh, I want more 
 Never thought my gifts would seal my worth 
 I never wanted fans, just wanted church 
 Oh, I want more 
 More than this whole world can offer 
 More than all that time destroys 
 And all I've wanted here can't satisfy my wanting 
 'Cause I was made, made for more 
 And after all I wasn't made for here 
 But I give myself to all You gave 
 Well, I wanna see my kids grow old 
 And always have Your hand to hold 
 Oh, I was made, made for more, made for more

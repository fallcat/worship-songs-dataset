You're calling me over 
 You're pulling me close 
 With love You surround me 
 You give me hope 
 You're taking me deeper 
 You're making me whole 
 With grace You redeem me 
 You restore my soul 
 Now I'm made new 
 Because of You 
 You hold my head up 
 You remind me who I am 
 You hold my head up 
 I'm alive in You again 
 I'm made new 
 You're making me stronger 
 You're healing my heart 
 With Your hands You hold me 
 And You set me apart 
 You are my salvation 
 I will not fear 
 You're the strength of my life 
 I won't fear

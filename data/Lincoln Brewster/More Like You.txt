My ways are not Your ways 
 My thoughts are not Your thoughts 
 As the Heavens are higher than the Earth 
 Search me and know my heart 
 I give myself to You 
 For the Heavens are higher than the Earth 
 I know Your ways are higher 
 I know Your love is greater 
 Show me Your ways 
 I wanna be more like You 
 Make me more like You 
 My ways are not Your ways 
 My thoughts are not Your thoughts 
 As the Heavens are higher than the Earth 
 Lord come and mold my heart 
 My eyes are set on You 
 For the Heavens are higher than the Earth

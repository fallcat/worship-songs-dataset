You're the one who walked on water 
 And You calmed the raging seas 
 You command the highest mountains 
 To fall upon their knees 
 You're the one who welcomed sinners 
 And You opened blinded eyes 
 You restored the brokenhearted 
 And You brought the dead to life 
 Forgetting all our sins 
 You remember all Your promises 
 You are amazing 
 More than amazing 
 Forever our God 
 You're more than enough 
 You are amazing 
 With authority You've spoken 
 And You've set the captive free 
 You're the King who came to serve 
 And You're the God who washed our feet 
 You're the one who took our burdens 
 And You bled upon the cross 
 In Your kindness and Your mercy 
 You became the way for us 
 Forgetting all our sins 
 You remember all Your promises 
 You are amazing 
 More than amazing 
 Forever our God 
 You're more than enough 
 You are amazing 
 More than amazing 
 Forever our God 
 You're more than enough 
 Oh, how marvelous 
 Oh, how wonderful 
 Oh, how glorious 
 You are amazing 
 Oh, how marvelous 
 Oh, how wonderful 
 Oh, how glorious You are 
 Oh, how marvelous 
 Oh, how wonderful 
 Oh, how glorious 
 You are amazing 
 Oh, how marvelous 
 Oh, how wonderful 
 Oh, how glorious You are 
 You are amazing 
 More than amazing 
 Forever our God 
 You're more than enough

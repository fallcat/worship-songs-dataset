O holy night, 
 The stars are brightly shining 
 It is the night of 
 Our dear Savior's birth 
 Long lay the world 
 In sin and error pining 
 Till He appeared 
 And the soul felt its worth. 
 The thrill of hope 
 The weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks 
 A new and glorious morn. 
 Fall on your knees 
 O hear the angel voices 
 O night divine 
 O night when Christ was born 
 O night divine, O night 
 O night divine 
 Truly He taught us 
 To love one another 
 His law is love and 
 His gospel is peace. 
 Chains shall He break 
 For the slave is our brother 
 And in His name 
 All oppression shall cease. 
 Sweet hymns of joy in 
 Grateful chorus raise we 
 With all our harts 
 We praise His holy name 
 Christ is the Lord 
 Oh praise His name forever 
 His power and glory evermore proclaim 
 His power and glory 
 Evermore proclaim. 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Oh Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Fall on your knees 
 Oh hear the angel voices 
 O night divine 
 O night when Christ was born 
 O night divine, O night 
 O night divine

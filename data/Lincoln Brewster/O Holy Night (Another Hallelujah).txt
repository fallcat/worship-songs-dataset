O come, O come, Emmanuel 
 And ransom captive Israel 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the Son of God appear 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel. 
 O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free 
 Thine own from Satan's tyranny 
 From depths of Hell Thy people save 
 And give them victory o'er the grave 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel. 
 O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by Thine advent here 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel. 
 O come, Thou Key of David, come, 
 And open wide our heavenly home; 
 Make safe the way that leads on high, 
 And close the path to misery. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel. 
 O come, O come, Thou Lord of might, 
 Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height, 
 In ancient times didn't give the Law, 
 In cloud, and majesty and awe. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel.

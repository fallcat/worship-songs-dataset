Here in this moment 
 We find a mercy that's made new 
 Our fears we surrender 
 For all our hope is found in You 
 On Your word we stand 
 You're faithful to the end 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 He's on our side, on our side 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 He's on our side 
 Here in Your presence 
 We find the strength to live by faith 
 Through trials and failures 
 We know there's power in Your name 
 On Your word we stand 
 You're faithful to the end 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 Your love remains 
 God You have made a way 
 We are forever saved 
 Your love won't change 
 God You will stay the same 
 You will forever reign 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 We believe our God is on our side 
 Now and forever, now and forever 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 He's on our side, on our side 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 He's on our side 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 He's on our side, on our side 
 Whoa-oh-oh 
 He's on our side

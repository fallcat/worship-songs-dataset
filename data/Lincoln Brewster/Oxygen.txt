Wake up, eyes open wide to 
 Mercy waiting that's brand new 
 Your love's taking me over again 
 Your hands, lifting me up so 
 I find wherever I go 
 Your love's taking me over again 
 You are life, every breath 
 You're the heart beating in my chest 
 I breathe out and breathe You in 
 I need You more than oxygen 
 Each step, I find that You are 
 Speaking Your will to my heart 
 Your love leading me all of the way 
 You speak, I am an echo 
 Your voice, I choose to follow 
 Your love leading me all the way 
 All of the way 
 I need You more than anything 
 More than oxygen

As Your love sings a melody 
 Let our lives live in harmony 
 One big holy symphony 
 For all to see In unity 
 Ahhhhhhmeeeeeeeeeeeeeen Ahhhhhhhmen 
 Praises be to the King 
 His majesty reigns on high 
 Praises be to the King 
 His majesty reigns on high 
 Let Your spirit move sovereignly 
 Let our hearts be touched tenderly 
 Let Your love grow inside of me 
 For all to see so endlessly 
 Ahhhhhhmeeeeeeeeeeeeeen Ahhhhhhhmen

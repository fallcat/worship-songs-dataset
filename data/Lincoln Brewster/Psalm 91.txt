I won't be afraid anymore 
 Of the terrors by night 
 Or the arrow that flies by day 
 And though a thousand may fall 
 At my side 
 And though ten thousand may fall 
 In Him I'll put all my trust 
 He who dwells in the secret place 
 Of the Most High 
 Shall abide in the shadow 
 He who dwells in the secret place 
 Of the Most High 
 Shall abide in the shadow 
 I will hide in Your wings always 
 Your angels stand by to keep me 
 In all my ways 
 And though a thousand may fall 
 At my side 
 I will say in Him I trust 
 And though a thousand may fall 
 At my side 
 And though ten thousand may fall 
 I will say of the Lord 
 That in Him I put all my trust

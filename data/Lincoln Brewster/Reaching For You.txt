You created me inside Your great imagination 
 You're the One who gave me my first breath 
 You have overseen my life and brought me to redemption 
 And I know that You're not finished with me yet 
 I'm reaching for You 
 I'm singing to You 
 I'm lifting my hands to praise You 
 I'm lifting my voice to thank You 
 I'm reaching for You 
 Jesus I need You 
 I'm giving my heart to know You 
 I'm living my life to serve You 
 I'm reaching for You 
 You're the one who spoke the Word of life to light my darkness 
 You opened up my eyes 'til I could see 
 Jesus You have promised to complete the work You started 
 Faithful to fulfill Your grace in me 
 Pour out Your love from heaven 
 Fill me until I overflow Lord I want more 
 Reach down Your hands from heaven 
 Pull me closer than ever before Lord I want more 
 Pour out Your love from heaven 
 Fill me until I overflow 'cause I want more 
 Reach down Your hands from heaven 
 Pull me closer than ever before Lord I want more 
 Oh I'm reaching 
 God I'm reaching for You

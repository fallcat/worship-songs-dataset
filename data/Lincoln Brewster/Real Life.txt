I still see the kid in me 
 Building castles by the sea 
 And skipping rocks across those ocean waves 
 Still building buoy rafts 
 And sailing on the Kachemak 
 And running wild across Alaskan plains 
 And all my yesterdays 
 Don't seem so long ago now 
 And all those early years 
 Will always seem like home somehow 
 And it was real life 
 And it was real good 
 It was a place I took for granted 
 'Cause I just never understood 
 And there was real pain 
 There were real tears 
 But the way my Mama loved me 
 Somehow carried all those years 
 It was real life, oh it was real life 
 I still see the kid in jeans 
 But now he's standing next to me 
 Never thought that I'd have boys to raise 
 I don't have it figured out 
 It still feels like playing house 
 And it's something I am learning everyday 
 And all of my today's seem 
 Like they're rushing by so fast 
 And every time I look around 
 I pray that it will last 
 And it's real life 
 And it's real good 
 And sometimes I take it all for granted 
 Even though I never should 
 And there is real pain 
 And there are real tears 
 But the way my baby loves me 
 Somehow carries all these years 
 And this is real life 
 When I'm old and turning gray 
 And my boys have moved away 
 When it's time for me to say goodbye 
 I hope I leave a legacy 
 I hope that God is proud of me 
 I hope that I leave something good behind 
 And all my yesterdays 
 Are flashing right before my eyes 
 And I'm standing in God's presence 
 When I finally realize 
 This is real life 
 This is real good 
 It's a place I took for granted 
 'Cause I just never understood 
 And there'll be no pain 
 And there'll be no tears 
 'Cause the way my Father loves me 
 Is the reason I am here 
 This is real life 
 Oh, this is real life 
 This is real life

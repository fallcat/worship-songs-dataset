God above all the world in motion 
 God above all my hopes and fears 
 And I don't care what the world throws at me now 
 I'm gonna be alright, yeah 
 Hear the sound of the generations 
 Making loud our freedom song 
 All in all that the world would know Your name 
 I'm gonna be alright 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 Salvation is here 
 God above all the world in motion 
 God above all my hopes and fears 
 And I don't care what the world throws at me now 
 I'm gonna be alright 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 I'm gonna be alright 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and He lives in me 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation that died just to set me free 
 Salvation is here 
 Salvation is here and He lives in me 
 Salvation is here 
 'Cause You are alive and You live in me 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 It's gonna be alright 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails 
 And I know my God made a way for me 
 I'm gonna be alright 
 'Cause I know my God saved the day 
 And I know His word never fails

By the hand of Your Spirit 
 Play the strings of my heart 
 And reveal all my hidden songs 
 By Your love let me hear it 
 When the song in my heart is not for You 
 Hold me in Your hands 
 Receive me as I am 
 And take, take me away 
 I wanna be in the Secret Place 
 Lord, I worship You 
 On the waves of Your mercy 
 I will sail on Your sea 
 I will give to You all of me 
 And in the light of Your glory 
 I will lay on my face and worship You 
 Hold me in Your hands 
 Receive me as I am 
 And take, take me away 
 I wanna be in the Secret Place 
 Hold me in Your hands 
 Receive me as I am 
 And take, take me away 
 I wanna be in the Secret Place 
 Hold me in Your hands 
 Receive me as I am 
 And take, take me away 
 I wanna be in the Secret Place 
 Yeah, I wanna be in the Secret Place 
 With You is where I wanna be, yeah yeah 
 Lord I worship You, Lord, I love You 
 Lord I love, You, Lord, I need You 
 Lord I love, You, Lord, I need You 
 Lord, I worship You 
 And I lift my heart and my hands to You 
 All my days

Pour out your fervent praise 
 There's a song to raise 
 Like a banner high 
 Lift up your grateful heart 
 To the Morning Star 
 He's alive and here with us 
 Shout for joy 
 For the Son of God 
 Is the Saving One 
 He's the Saving One 
 Shout for joy 
 See what love has done 
 He has come for us 
 He's the Saving One 
 We stood on sinking sand 
 He reached out His hand 
 Pulled us to His side 
 We turned our hearts away 
 He was strong to save 
 Now our Savior reigns in us 
 Shout for joy 
 For the Son of God 
 Is the Saving One 
 He's the Saving One 
 Shout for joy 
 See what love has done 
 He has come for us 
 He's the Saving One 
 There is no other God like You 
 We'll sing the praises that You're due 
 Jesus, You have saved us 
 There is no other God who reigns 
 You are the name above all names 
 Jesus, You have saved us 
 Shout for joy 
 For the Son of God 
 Is the Saving One 
 He's the Saving One 
 Shout for joy 
 See what love has done 
 He has come for us 
 He's the Saving One

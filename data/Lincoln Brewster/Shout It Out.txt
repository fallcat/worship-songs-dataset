You make all things new 
 We are living proof 
 You take broken lives 
 And You make them fly 
 We belong, now we belong 
 This is freedom 
 We have a reason 
 To be shouting 
 Everybody shout it! 
 We're walkin' in the light 
 Our hearts have come alive 
 We are living now 
 To shout it out! 
 To shout it out! 
 You make darkness shine 
 And bring us back to life 
 What was lost is found 
 Saved beyond a doubt 
 We belong, now we belong 
 This is freedom 
 We have a reason 
 To be shouting 
 Everybody shout it! 
 We're walkin' in the light 
 Our hearts have come alive 
 We are living now 
 To shout it out! 
 We are free, we are free 
 To shout it 
 We are free, free indeed 
 Everybody sing 
 We are free, we are free 
 To shout it 
 We are free, free indeed 
 Everybody sing 
 Shout it out 
 Shout it out 
 Shout it out 
 Shout it out 
 Everybody sing 
 This is freedom 
 We have a reason 
 To be shouting 
 Everybody shout it! 
 We're walkin' in the light 
 Our hearts have come alive 
 We are living now 
 To shout it out 
 To shout it out

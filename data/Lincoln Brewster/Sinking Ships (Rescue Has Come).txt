As you sail on the sea 
 You could never seem to see 
 That all of your dreams 
 Could be tossed in the waves 
 And lost in the ocean 
 Sinking in, that sinking feeling 
 And as your world 
 Has stopped its turning 
 Your heart stands still 
 Hanging by this melody of a life 
 That hasn't lost its meaning 
 When you're lost at sea 
 I will be your shore 
 So hold on tight 
 Your ship is going down 
 In the storm of life 
 I won't let you drown 
 It'll be alright 
 Now if you just hold on 
 So just hold on 
 Rescue has come 
 Right where the stars have left you 
 Dead in the cold and on your own 
 But I see a silver lining appear 
 Beyond the dark 
 And beyond your fears 
 'Cause you were never meant 
 To do this alone 
 And when you're lost at sea 
 I will be your shore 
 So hold on tight 
 Your ship is going down 
 In the storm of life 
 I won't let you drown 
 It'll be alright 
 Now if you just hold on 
 So just hold on 
 Rescue has come 
 Through the storm, through the night 
 Hold onto hope, I'll be your guide 
 And when the waves come crashing 
 Down by your side is where I'll stay 
 So hold on tight 
 Your ship is going down 
 In the storm of life 
 I won't let you drown 
 It'll be alright 
 Now if you just hold on 
 So just hold on 
 Rescue has come 
 Rescue has come 
 I will be your shore

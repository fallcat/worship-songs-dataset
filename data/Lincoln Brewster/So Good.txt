You're the hope in my heart 
 You're the light in the dark 
 And You hold me in Your hands 
 O Most High, O Most High 
 You're the strength when I'm weak 
 You're the grace that I need 
 And Your mercy saved my soul 
 O Most High, O Most High 
 I will sing of Your love in the morning 
 And Your faithfulness at night 
 You are good, so good 
 All the time, all my life 
 You are good, so good 
 Your love remains 
 You never change 
 You are good, so good 
 And I'm still singing because 
 You are so good, so good 
 In the flood and the flame 
 You are making a way 
 And You'll never let me go 
 O Most High, O Most High 
 Every word You have said 
 You will never forget 
 All Your promises will stand 
 O Most High, O Most High 
 I will sing of Your love in the morning 
 And Your faithfulness at night 
 You are good, so good 
 All the time, all my life 
 You are good, so good 
 Your love remains 
 You never change 
 You are good, so good 
 And I'm still singing 
 Because You are so good 
 I'm holding on to Your promises 
 I'm holding on to Your faithfulness 
 I'm holding on to Your promises 
 I'm holding on to Your faithfulness 
 You are good, so good 
 All the time, all my life 
 You are good, so good 
 Your love remains 
 You never change 
 You are good, so good 
 And I'm still singing because 
 I know 
 You are good, so good 
 All the time, all my life 
 You are good, so good 
 Your love remains 
 You never change 
 You are good, so good 
 And I'm still singing because 
 You are so good, so good 
 Lord, You are so good 
 You are so good 
 You are so good

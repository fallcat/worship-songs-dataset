"To serve You Lord is a delight 
 And I just won't give up this fight 
 Lord I'll finish the race 
 Pressing toward the things above 
 As I'm covered in Your love 
 Till I see You face to face 
 You are my superstar 
 You are my superstar 
 I wanna be where You are 
 And I love you 
 To know You Lord is a delight 
 I worship You with all my might 
 You're the one I wanna chase 
 Pressing on toward the prize 
 My reflection in Your eyes 
 When I see You face to face 
 (Repeat chorus 2 times) 
 Jesus nothing compares 
 To what You've done in my life 
 And You are my one and only 
 You'll never leave me or forsake me 
 You're my friend till the end of time 
 You are my superstar 
 (Repeat chorus 2 times)"

Take not Your Spirit from me 
 Lord lead me to Your peace 
 For my one desire is to be with You 
 Come cleanse my life and make me pure 
 Won't you wrap me up in Your arms and 
 Take me higher and draw me closer 
 And pull me deeper than I've ever been 
 Hide not Your face from me 
 Lord set my spirit free 
 FOr my one desire is to be with You 
 Come cleanse my life and make me pure 
 Won't You wrap me up in Your arms and 
 Take me higher and draw me closer 
 And pull me deeper than I've ever been 
 Hide not Your face from me 
 Lord set my spirit free 
 FOr my one desire is to be with You 
 Come cleanse my life and make me pure 
 Won't You wrap me up in Your arms and 
 Take me higher and draw me closer 
 And pull me deeper than I've ever been 
 Hide not Your face from me 
 Lord set my spirit free 
 FOr my one desire is to be with You 
 Come cleanse my life and make me pure 
 Won't You wrap me up in Your arms and 
 Take me higher 
 Won't You draw me closer 
 Take me higher than I've ever been 
 Next to You is where I wanna be 
 Take me higher than I've ever been 
 Take not your Spirit from me 
 Take me 
 Take me higher than I've ever been before 
 Take me higher and draw me closer 
 And pull me deeper than I've ever been 
 Hide not Your face from me 
 Lord set my spirit free 
 FOr my one desire is to be with You 
 Come cleanse my life and make me pure 
 Won't You wrap me up in Your arms and 
 Take me higher and draw me closer 
 And pull me deeper than I've ever been 
 Hide not Your face from me 
 Lord set my spirit free 
 FOr my one desire is to be with You 
 Come cleanse my life and make me pure 
 Won't You wrap me up in Your arms and

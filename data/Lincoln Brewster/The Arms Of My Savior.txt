When I'm all alone and the weight of the world 
 Is more than I can bear on my own 
 When all my plans have failed and I've suffered defeat 
 I'm down on my knees, I can't get to my feet 
 Your love breaks through 
 And reminds me of the hope that I have in You 
 That I have in You 
 There's no other place that I'd rather be 
 Than safe in the arms, the arms of my Savior 
 There's no other place where I can be free 
 So I run to the arms, the arms of my Savior 
 When I'm feeling overwhelmed like I can't take anymore 
 I've thrown up my hands, all I see is the floor 
 I've looked to the north, the south, the west and the east 
 But as far as I can see, I can't find any peace 
 Then Your grace breaks through 
 Oh, and reminds me of the hope that I have in You 
 That I have in You 
 There's no other place that I'd rather be 
 Than safe in the arms, the arms of my Savior 
 There's no other place where I can be free 
 So I run to the arms, the arms of my Savior 
 Life shouldn't be something to dread 
 'Cause I know You still know 
 How many hairs are in my head 
 And so I run to You, and so I run to You 
 There's no other place, there's no other place 
 There's no other place that I'd rather be 
 (Safe) 
 There's no other place, there's no other place 
 There's no other place where I'd rather be 
 There's no other place, than in Your arms, in Your arms 
 God, pray to You and God, say to You 
 In Your arms, God, live for You

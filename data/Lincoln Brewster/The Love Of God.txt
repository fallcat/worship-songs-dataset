Emmanuel 
 You're with me surely closer than I can say 
 And I know Thee well 
 I'm hidden shadowed under Your wings always 
 And oh, where else can I turn but to the love of God 
 In brokenness 
 I know you hold me safe in redemption's arms 
 And I confess 
 You alone restore me, leading me to Your heart 
 And oh, where else can I turn but to the love of God 
 Nowhere else can I turn but to the love 
 Oh, where else can I turn but to Your love 
 Nowhere else can I turn but to the love of God

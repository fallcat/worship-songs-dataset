Lord I come to You 
 Let my heart be changed renewed 
 Flowing from the grace that I found 
 In You 
 Lord I've come to know 
 The weaknesses I see in me 
 Will be stripped away 
 By the power of Your love 
 Hold me close 
 Let Your love surround me 
 Bring me near 
 Draw me to Your side 
 And as I wait 
 I'll rise up like the eagle 
 And I will soar with You 
 Your Spirit leads me on 
 By the power of your love 
 Lord unveil my eyes 
 Let me see You face to face 
 The knowledge of Your love as You life 
 In me 
 Lord renew my mind 
 As Your will unfolds my life 
 In living every day 
 By the power of Your love 
 Hold me close 
 Let Your love surround me 
 Bring me near 
 Draw me to Your side 
 And as I wait 
 I'll rise up like the eagle 
 And I will soar with You 
 Your Spirit leads me on 
 By the power of your love 
 Hold me close 
 Let Your love surround me 
 Bring me near 
 Draw me to Your side 
 And as I wait 
 I'll rise up like the eagle 
 And I will soar with You 
 Your Spirit leads me on 
 By the power of your love

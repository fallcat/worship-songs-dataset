Surely children weren't made for the streets 
 And fathers were not made to leave 
 Surely this isn't how it should be 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Surely nations were not made for war 
 Or the broken meant to be ignored 
 Surely this just can't be what You saw 
 Let Your Kingdom come here in my heart 
 And I will live to carry Your compassion, to love a world that's broken 
 To be Your hands and feet 
 And I will give with the life that I've been given 
 And go beyond religion to see the world be changed 
 By the power of Your name 
 The power of Your name 
 Surely life wasn't made to regret 
 And the lost were not made to forget 
 Surely faith without action is dead 
 Let Your Kingdom come, lord, break this heart 
 And I will live to carry Your compassion, to love a world that's broken 
 To be Your hands and feet 
 And I will give with the life that I've been given 
 And go beyond religion to see the world be changed 
 By the power of Your name 
 The power of Your name 
 Jesus, Your name is a shelter for the hurting 
 Your name is a refuge for the weak 
 Only Your name can redeem the undeserving 
 Jesus, Your name holds everything I need 
 And I will live to carry Your compassion, to love a world that's broken 
 To be Your hands and feet 
 And I will give with the life that I've been given 
 And go beyond religion to see the world be changed 
 By the power of Your name 
 And I will live to carry Your compassion, to love a world that's broken 
 To be Your hands and feet 
 And I will give with the life that I've been given 
 And go beyond religion to see the world be changed 
 By the power of Your name 
 The power of Your name 
 (The power of Your name) 
 The power of Your name 
 The power of Your name 
 The power of Your name 
 (Jesus, Jesus, the power of Your name) 
 The power of Your name 
 (Jesus, Jesus, the power of Your name)

Where two or more are 
 Gathered in His name 
 He is there 
 For all who come 
 Who run to Him in faith 
 He is there, He is there 
 There is power 
 In the name of Jesus 
 There is power 
 Power in His name 
 No fear, no lie 
 Can stand against us now 
 He is here 
 The Word has come 
 To silence every doubt 
 He is here 
 One name, one name can save 
 One name breaks every chain 
 One name, always 
 One name, Jesus 
 One name, one name remains 
 One name, we will proclaim 
 One name, always 
 One name

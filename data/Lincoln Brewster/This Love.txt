One love to overshadow 
 Every other love, other love 
 One love to break the darkness 
 One love to overcome, overcome 
 Oh, Lord 
 Your love, it burns as fire 
 Brighter than the flame 
 As surely as the air I breathe 
 As surely as Your Word's alive in me 
 I'm held, oh, grace, remind me 
 As surely as the stars above me 
 Life eternal waiting for me 
 And I owe it to this love 
 One love beyond the heavens 
 And deeper than the seas, oh, oh 
 One love will be forever 
 Greater than my need, oh, yeah 
 Oh, Lord 
 Your love, it burns as fire 
 Brighter than the flame 
 As surely as the air I breathe 
 As surely as Your Word's alive in me 
 I'm held, oh, grace, remind me 
 As surely as the stars above me 
 Life eternal waiting for me 
 And I owe it to this love 
 Your love, it won't leave me 
 As surely as the air I breathe 
 As surely as Your Word's alive in me 
 I'm held, oh, grace, remind me 
 As surely as the stars above me 
 Life eternal waiting for me 
 And I owe it to this love 
 As surely as the air I breathe 
 As surely as Your Word's alive in me 
 I'm held, oh, grace, remind me 
 As surely as the stars above me 
 Life eternal waiting for me 
 And I owe it to this love 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, yeah 
 I stand redeemed 
 All I receive 
 I owe it to this love 
 I stand redeemed 
 All I receive 
 I owe it to this love

How many would do the same? 
 You die so others gain 
 Even for the ones who hate 
 For the soul of your name 
 Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me? 
 What kind of man would die to set us free? 
 Your love, your word, your fight 
 'Cause they rob you of your life 
 Whom of you would still cry 
 For the souls of the men who spear at your side? 
 Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me? 
 What kind of man would die to set us free? 
 What kind of man would die for you and me? 
 Wait now, it's not quite that simple 
 You just ask yourself 
 There are times where the answer seems so far away 
 Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me? 
 What kind of man would die to set us free? 
 What kind of man would die for you and me? 
 Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me?

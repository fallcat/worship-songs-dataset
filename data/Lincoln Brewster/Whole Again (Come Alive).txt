You know the cracks upon my heart 
 And save my tears inside a jar 
 You see beyond my veiled smile 
 As a father knows his child 
 You take all my brokenness 
 All my hurt and all my mess 
 Every piece in faithful hands 
 And somehow make me whole again 
 While time and trust taught me pain 
 You were there to show me grace 
 A thousand times I've been let down 
 But You redeem the hurt I've found 
 You take all my brokenness 
 All my hurt and all my mess 
 Every piece in faithful hands 
 And somehow make me whole again 
 You breathe upon 
 My weary soul 
 And I come alive 
 You breathe upon 
 My weary soul 
 And I come alive 
 You breathe upon 
 My weary soul 
 And I come alive 
 You breathe upon 
 My weary soul 
 And I come alive 
 You breathe upon 
 My weary soul 
 And I come alive 
 You breathe upon 
 My weary soul 
 And I come alive 
 You breathe upon 
 My weary soul 
 And I come alive 
 You take all my brokenness 
 All my hurt and all my mess 
 Every piece in faithful hands 
 And somehow make me whole again 
 You make me whole again 
 Whole again

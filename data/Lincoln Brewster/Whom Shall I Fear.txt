Because I know You live 
 I'll put my faith in this 
 That You hear my call 
 Lord, You hear me calling 
 Because I know You live 
 I'll set my heart on this 
 You won't let me fall 
 When all else is falling 
 When all You are is glorious, oh God 
 Victorious and strong 
 Whom shall I fear? 
 When all You are is powerful and true 
 And good in all You do 
 Whom shall I fear? Whom shall I fear? 
 Because You're on my side 
 I won't believe the lie 
 That I'm all alone 
 I'm not all alone here 
 Because You live in me 
 My heart will still believe 
 That You came to save 
 And You'll come to save me 
 I know You're with me in the fire 
 You never leave me in the flame 
 I know Your thoughts are so much higher 
 And all Your ways are not my ways 
 When all You are is glorious, oh God 
 Victorious and strong 
 Whom shall I fear? 
 When all You are is powerful and true 
 And good in all You do 
 Whom shall I fear? Whom shall I fear? 
 I know You're with me in the fire 
 You never leave me in the flame 
 I know Your thoughts are so much higher 
 And all Your ways are not my ways 
 When all You are is glorious, oh God 
 Victorious and strong 
 Whom shall I fear? 
 When all You are is powerful and true 
 And good in all You do 
 Whom shall I fear? 
 You are for me 
 You came to save me 
 You will never let me go 
 In my heart I'll always know 
 I know that You are for me 
 You came to save me 
 You will never let me go 
 In my heart I'll always know 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that You are for me 
 I know that you will 
 Never forsake me in my weakness 
 I know that You have come now 
 Even if to write upon my heart 
 To remind me who You

I get down on my knees and pray 
 I'll honor You in every way 
 'Cause now is the time to worship 
 And now is the time to life Your name 
 You alone are worthy 
 You alone are worthy 
 You alone are worthy 
 To be praised 
 You are my Father I am Your son 
 I lift my voice to the Holy One 
 'Cause now is the time to worship 
 And now is the time to lift Your name 
 I worship Your name I worship You 
 Lord I give You all my praise 
 And I'll honor You with my life 
 All of my days 
 There is none like You 
 You and You alone are wrothy to receive 
 All my praise 
 Lord I lift Your name 
 I lift Your name on high 
 (Repeat chorus 2 times)

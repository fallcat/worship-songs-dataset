Here I stand my life before You 
 I can't believe the price you paid 
 Gave it all just for me 
 I lay my life upon the alter 
 Take me now 
 I place my life in your hands 
 King of heaven, You're my Saviour 
 You left Your place of glory 
 Giving Your life just for me 
 How could I ever repay You 
 You came into my life Lord 
 You set me free 
 Everything I am I give to You 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 Take my life and everything I do 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 King of heaven, You're my Saviour 
 You left Your place of glory 
 Giving Your life just for me 
 How could I ever repay You 
 You came into my life Lord 
 You set me free 
 Everything I am I give to You 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 Take my life and everything I do 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 Everything I am I give to You 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 Take my life and everything I do 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 You are Holy, give You glory 
 You are Holy, give You glory 
 You are Holy, give You glory 
 You are Holy, give You glory 
 Everything I am I give to You 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 Take my life and everything I do 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 Everything I am I give to You 
 You are Holy, Holy 
 Take my life and everything I do 
 You are Holy, Holy

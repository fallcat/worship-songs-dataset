You're the one, who made the Heavens 
 You're the one, who shaped the earth 
 You're the one, who formed my heart 
 Long before my birth 
 I believe You'll always lead me 
 All my days have been ordained 
 All Your thoughts toward me are holy 
 Full of love and grace 
 You are the one, You are holy 
 You are the one, You are worthy 
 You are the one 
 You are the one, everlasting 
 You are the one, I will worship 
 You are the one, I will serve all my days 
 You are the one 
 You are the one, everlasting 
 You are the one, Jesus, You're the one

You never stop 
 You, You never stop reaching 
 To the place I am 
 On and on 
 You, You keep on reminding me 
 I'm in Your hands 
 So write it down 
 Right on my heart so 
 I won't forget it 
 I won't forget it 
 No matter what 
 Your love it won't fail me 
 No matter what 
 Your love is unchanging 
 Your love, Your love 
 Your love is unending 
 No matter what 
 You never stop, never stop 
 You meet me here 
 You meet me before 
 I even call Your name 
 I feel You near 
 I feel You surround me 
 And I'm not afraid 
 So write it down 
 Right on my heart so 
 I won't forget it 
 I won't forget it 
 No matter what 
 Your love it won't fail me 
 No matter what 
 Your love is unchanging 
 Your love, Your love 
 Your love is unending 
 No matter what 
 You never stop, never stop 
 Even when the darkness 
 Feels like the hardest place 
 It can't take Your love away 
 Even when the silence 
 Seems like You're far away 
 It can't take Your love away 
 Even when the darkness 
 Feels like the hardest place 
 It can't take Your love away 
 Even when the silence 
 Seems like You're far away 
 It can't take Your love away 
 No matter what 
 Your love it won't fail me 
 No matter what 
 Your love is unchanging 
 Your love, Your love 
 Your love is unending 
 No matter what 
 You never stop, never stop 
 No matter what 
 Your love it won't fail me 
 No matter what 
 Your love is unchanging 
 No matter what 
 Your love is unending 
 No matter what 
 You never stop, never stop 
 You never stop, never stop

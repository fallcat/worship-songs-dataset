Before the throne of the God above 
 I have a strong, a perfect plea 
 A great High Priest whose name is Love 
 Whoever lives and pleads for me 
 My name is graven on His hands 
 My name is written on His heart 
 I know that while in Heaven He stands 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart 
 Before the throne of the God above 
 I have a strong, a perfect plea 
 A great High Priest whose name is Love 
 Whoever lives and pleads for me 
 My name is graven on His hands 
 My name is written on His heart 
 I know that while in Heaven He stands 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart 
 When Satan temps me to despair 
 And tells me of the guilt within 
 Upward I look and see Him there 
 Who made an end to all my sin 
 Because the sinless Savior died 
 My sinful soul is counted free 
 For God the Just is satisfied 
 To look on Him and pardon me 
 To look on Him and pardon me 
 Behold Him there, The risen Lamb 
 My perfect, spotless righteousness 
 The great unchangeable I Am 
 The King of glory and of grace 
 One with Himself I cannot die 
 My soul is purchased with His blood 
 My life is hid with Christ on high 
 With Christ, My Savior and my God 
 With Christ, My Savior and my God 
 One with Himself I cannot die 
 My soul is purchased with His blood 
 My life is hid with Christ on high 
 With Christ, My Savior and my God 
 With Christ, My Savior and my God

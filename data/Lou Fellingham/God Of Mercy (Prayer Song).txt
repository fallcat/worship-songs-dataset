God of mercy, here I cry 
 Turn Your hand tonight 
 Bring relief from their pain 
 Be their comfort 
 And every day they're given breath 
 Give them strength to live 
 And as their weary bodies fail 
 Fighting is over, flesh gives way 
 Be their light to guide them home 
 God of mercy, here I cry 
 Heal their souls tonight 
 Give them peace from their fears 
 Be their hope, Lord 
 And every day You give them breath 
 Give them strength to live 
 And as their weary bodies fail 
 Fighting is over, flesh gives way 
 Be their star to guide them home 
 Sometimes I don't know what to ask for 
 Sometimes I don't know what to say 
 But I know that You are watching over them 
 Sometimes I don't know what to pray for 
 Sometimes I don't know how to give 
 But I know that You are watching over them 
 And their life is not in vain 
 So God of mercy, here I cry 
 Turn your hand tonight 
 Bring relieve from their pain 
 Be their comfort 
 And every day they're given breath 
 Give them strength to live 
 And as their weary bodies fail 
 Fighting is over, flesh gives way 
 Be their light to guide them home

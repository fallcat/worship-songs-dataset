Holy ground 
 We are standing on holy ground 
 Here before Your throne 
 With open arms we worship You 
 You are holy, You are worthy 
 To receive power, wisdom and strength 
 In their thousands angels worship 
 Giving praise and all glory to You 
 Holy one 
 In all earth and heaven there is none 
 To compare with You 
 Your glory outshines the sun 
 Heaven and earth will change 
 But You remain the Lord of all 
 We are standing here on holy ground

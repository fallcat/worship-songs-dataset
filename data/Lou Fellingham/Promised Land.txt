Once I was dead to You and I could not hear 
 I was blind to the truth and was nowhere near 
 But then You gave me life and You gripped my soul 
 With a love so pure and You won't let go 
 What a Savior, my redeemer, You have freed me 
 Helped me understand 
 Through Your suffering, I'm forgiven 
 Pressing onward to The Promised Land 
 Sent from His Father above, Jesus walked this earth 
 Knew His destiny as He read the word 
 Not shrinking back from the task He pursued His goal 
 Came to ransom lives and to make them whole 
 Now with the Spirit's help I can journey on 
 Knowing peace with God, my conviction's strong 
 Because of Jesus' blood I am now secure 
 And because He lives my hope is sure 
 You've bought me with a price, a perfect sacrifice 
 Now all I have I give to You 
 My life no longer mine, to live or die is Christ 
 Bound now for Heaven 
 His name is Jesus, risen Savior, He's our healer 
 Death could not withstand 
 His name is Jesus, sent from Heaven 
 To take us homeward to The Promised Land

Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echo back their joyous strains 
 Gloria in excelsis Deo 
 Gloria in excelsis Deo 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 Say what may the tidings be 
 Which inspire your heavenly song? 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 Him whose birth the angels sing 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ, the Lord, the newborn King 
 See within a manger laid 
 Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth 
 Mary, Joseph lend your aid 
 With us sing our Savior's birth

At all times 
 All times 
 I will bless the Lord 
 At all times 
 At all times 
 Strong and courageous 
 Mighty in battle 
 He's fighting for us 
 The victory is ours 
 Put on your armor 
 The sword of the spirit 
 Our weapon is worship 
 The victory is ours 
 Shout out to Jesus 
 At all times 
 All times 
 I will bless the Lord 
 At all times 
 At all times 
 Praise Him in the valley 
 Praise Him on the mountain 
 Praise Him in the heavens 
 The victory is ours 
 Worship while you're weeping 
 Worship while you're waiting 
 Worship while you're winning 
 The victory is ours 
 Shout out to Jesus 
 Shout out to Jesus 
 At all times 
 All times 
 I will bless the Lord 
 At all times 
 At all times 
 At all times 
 At all times 
 At all times 
 All times 
 I will bless the Lord 
 At all times

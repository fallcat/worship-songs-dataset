Back to you 
 I could never say enough to thank You 
 For everything You've done for me 
 And I might think I could do enough to show You 
 But I know that's just a crazy dream 
 This shouldn't be complicated 
 This isn't that hard to see 
 It's not about what I do for You 
 It's what You've done for me 
 You gave Your love, You gave Your life 
 You gave Your everything and I 
 Wanna give it all back 
 Give it all back to You 
 You took a heart so black and blue 
 And piece by piece You make it new 
 The only thing left, the only thing left to do 
 Is give it all back to You 
 Give it all back to You 
 I just want to be a life that You use 
 I want all of me to be all for You 
 And when I get it wrong You stick with me 
 Ain't that the truth 
 It's just what You do 
 This shouldn't be complicated 
 This isn't that hard to see 
 It's not about what I do for You 
 It's what You've done for me 
 You gave Your love, You gave Your life 
 You gave Your everything and I 
 Wanna give it all back 
 Give it all back to You 
 You took a heart so black and blue 
 And piece by piece You make it new 
 The only thing left, the only thing left to do 
 Is give it all back to You 
 Give it all back to You 
 I won't forget what You did 
 How You died so I could live 
 I don't deserve this kind of love 
 I'll testify, testify how You gave Your life for mine 
 The only thing I know to do is give it all back to You 
 It's not about what I do for You 
 It's what You've done for me 
 You gave Your love, You gave Your life 
 You gave Your everything and I 
 Wanna give it all back 
 Give it all back to You 
 You took a heart so black and blue 
 And piece by piece You make it new 
 The only thing left, the only thing left to do 
 Is give it all back to You 
 Give it all back to You

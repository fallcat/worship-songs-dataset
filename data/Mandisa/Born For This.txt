Feels like I've been holding my breath 
 Trying to still my restless heart 
 Everything hangs on my next step 
 Finding my nerve, playing my part 
 I found shelter underneath His crown 
 Found favor inside His eyes 
 Rock this boat and I just might drown 
 Honesty seemed to come with a price 
 There's a time to hold your tongue 
 Time to keep your head down 
 There's a time but it's not now 
 Sometimes you gotta go uninvited 
 Sometimes you gotta speak 
 When you don't have the floor 
 Sometimes you gotta move 
 When everybody else says you should stay 
 No way, no, not today 
 You gotta ask if you want an answer 
 Sometimes you gotta stand apart from the crowd 
 Long before your heart could run the risk 
 You were born for this, hey 
 You were born for this 
 I'm leaning on the ones before me 
 My father's father's dreams 
 I'm standing on the top of their shoulders 
 Calling the One, delivering me 
 There's a time to hold your tongue 
 Time to keep your head down 
 There's a time but it's not now 
 Sometimes you gotta go uninvited 
 Sometimes you gotta speak 
 When you don't have the floor 
 Sometimes you gotta move 
 When everybody else says you should stay 
 No way, no, not today 
 You gotta ask if you want an answer 
 Sometimes you gotta stand apart from the crowd 
 Long before your heart could run the risk 
 You were born for this, hey 
 You were born for this 
 One step, one move, born to trust You 
 Made to lay my life before You 
 So I gotta go uninvited 
 Sometimes you gotta speak 
 When you don't have the floor 
 Sometimes you gotta move 
 When everybody else says you should stay 
 No way, no, not today 
 You gotta ask if you want an answer 
 Sometimes you gotta stand apart from the crowd 
 Long before your heart could run the risk 
 You were born for this 
 You were born for this 
 You were born for this 
 You were born for this 
 You were born for this 
 You were born for this

With my love and my sadness 
 I come before You Lord 
 My heart's in a thousand pieces 
 Maybe even more 
 Yet I trust in this moment 
 You're with me somehow 
 And You've always been faithful 
 So Lord even now 
 When all that I can sing 
 Is a broken hallelujah 
 When my only offering 
 Is shattered praise 
 Still a song of adoration 
 Will rise up from these ruins 
 I will worship You and give You thanks 
 Even when my only praise 
 Is a broken hallelujah 
 Oh Father, You have given 
 Much more than I deserve 
 And I have felt Your hand of blessing 
 On me at every turn 
 How could I doubt Your goodness 
 Your wisdom, Your grace 
 So Lord hear my heart 
 In this painful place 
 Hallelujah 
 I lift my voice 
 Your Spirit moves 
 I raise my hands 
 I reach for You

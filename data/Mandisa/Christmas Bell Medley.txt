Silver Bells, Silver Bells 
 It's Christmas time in the city 
 Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 City sidewalks 
 Busy sidewalks 
 Dressed in holiday style 
 In the air there's 
 A feeling of Christmas 
 Children laughing 
 People passing 
 Meeting smile after smile 
 And on every 
 Street corner you'll hear 
 Silver Bells, Silver Bells 
 It's Christmas time in the city 
 Ring-a-ling, hear them sing 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 Strings of street lights 
 Even stoplights 
 Blink a bright red and green 
 As the shoppers rush home 
 With their treasures 
 Hear the snow crunch 
 See the kids bunch 
 This is Santa's big scene 
 And above all 
 This bustle you'll here 
 Silver Bells, Silver Bells 
 It's Christmas time in the city 
 Ring-a-ling, hear them sing 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 Silver Bells, Silver Bells 
 It's Christmas time in the city 
 Ring-a-ling, hear them sing 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 Soon it will be Christmas Day 
 Hark! how the bells 
 Sweet silver bells 
 All seem to say, 
 "Throw cares away." 
 Christmas is here 
 Bringing good cheer 
 To young and old 
 Meek and the bold 
 Ding, dong, ding, dong 
 That is their song 
 With joyful ring 
 All caroling 
 One seems to hear 
 Words of good cheer 
 From ev'rywhere 
 Filling the air 
 Oh how they pound 
 Raising the sound 
 O'er hill and dale 
 Telling their tale 
 Gaily they ring 
 While people sing 
 Songs of good cheer 
 Christmas is here 
 Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas 
 Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas 
 On, on they send 
 On without end 
 Their joyful tone 
 To ev'ry home 
 Caroling, caroling, now we go 
 Christmas bells are ringing 
 Caroling, caroling through the snow 
 Christmas bells are ringing 
 Joyous voices sweet and clear 
 Sing the sad of heart to cheer 
 Ding dong, ding dong 
 Christmas bells are ringing 
 Caroling, caroling through the town 
 Christmas bells are ringing 
 Caroling, caroling up and down 
 Christmas bells are ringing 
 Mark ye well the song we sing 
 Gladsome tidings now we bring 
 Ding dong, ding dong 
 Christmas bells are ringing! 
 Caroling, caroling, near and far 
 Christmas bells are ringing 
 Following, following yonder star 
 Christmas bells are ringing 
 Sing we all this happy morn 
 "Lo, the King of heav'n is born!" 
 Ding dong, ding dong 
 Christmas bells are ringing

Snow covered rooftops, lights on the trees 
 The sound of singing I hear down every street 
 Families have gathered from miles away 
 Oh, Merry Christmas, it's Christmas day 
 You see that old tree down Cotton Lane 
 Those lights keep shining, it's always the same 
 We hear the church bells ring out to say 
 Oh, Merry Christmas, it's Christmas day 
 Oh, Merry Christmas, it's Christmas day 
 Swing the lights and hang the stockings 
 Decorate with green and red 
 Made the cookies for old Santa 
 Made a runway for his sled 
 Singing carols on a sleigh ride 
 Gather 'round the manger scene 
 Open presents, read the letters 
 And together we will sing 
 Oh, Merry Christmas, joy to the world 
 For every nation, for every boy and girl 
 Let's light a candle, for peace we pray 
 Oh, Merry Christmas, it's Christmas day 
 It's Christmas day, it's Christmas day, oh 
 Let's light a candle, for peace we pray 
 Oh, Merry Christmas, it's Christmas day 
 Oh, Merry Christmas, it's Christmas day, oh, ooh

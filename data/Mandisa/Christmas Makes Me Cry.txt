I think of loved ones who've passed away 
 And I pray they're resting in a better place 
 I think of memories of years gone by 
 And sometimes Christmas makes me cry 
 I think of soldiers across the sea 
 Sometimes I wonder why it's them instead of me 
 But for my freedom they give their lives 
 And sometimes Christmas makes me cry 
 Tears of faithfulness, tears of hope 
 I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know 
 There is peace on earth for every heart to find 
 And sometimes Christmas makes me cry 
 I think of family, I think of home 
 And say a prayer for those who spend this time alone 
 'Cause love can reach out into a silent night 
 And that's why Christmas makes me cry 
 Tears of faithfulness, tears of hope 
 I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know 
 There is peace on earth for every heart to find 
 And sometimes Christmas makes me cry 
 I think of Mary and the virgin birth 
 And I'm amazed by how much God thinks we are worth 
 That He would send His only Son to die 
 And sometimes Christmas makes me cry 
 Tears of faithfulness and tears of hope 
 I cry tears of joy at Christmas because I know 
 There is peace on earth for every heart to find 
 And sometimes Christmas makes me 
 Oh, sometimes Christmas makes me 
 Christmas makes me cry 
 Christmas makes me cry

Maybe you don't understand why I gotta dance 
 There was something had me down but it's over now 
 I'm a throw my hands up 
 Wave 'em all in the air 
 'Cause all I wanna do is dance, dance, dance 
 They told me you ain't good enough 
 Don't look good enough 
 Don't sing good enough 
 Maybe you should give it up 
 And if I would've then I never could've received 
 None of the things that He planned for me 
 So I waited a little longer 
 Grew a little stronger and then 
 I realized something was happening 
 It's so incredible, it's unexplainable 
 You oughta try Him for yourself and see because 
 Sometimes I think about 
 How it used to be, and can't help but 
 Remembering how it was never easy for me, no, no 
 But the way God works, it's so amazing 
 He never forgot me, I can't forget Him 
 That's enough for me to lift my hands and 
 I'm sorry if you don't understand 
 All my tears (it's over now) 
 And all my pain (it's over now) 
 All my doubts (it's over now) 
 They went away (it's over now) 
 No more fear (it's over now) 
 And I'm glad (it's over now) 
 Yes, so glad 
 'Cause all I wanna do is dance

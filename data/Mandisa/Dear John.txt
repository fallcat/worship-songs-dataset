Dear John, How you doin' 
 I've been thinking about you 
 I'm not sure how to say it, 
 But I've been praying daily 
 For some kind of a breakthrough 
 I've said this a thousand times 
 And I know you don't see my side 
 But I do it 'cause I love you 
 So, dear John here's the truth... 
 There's freedom 
 On the other side of 
 Things that keep us tied up and afraid 
 There's hope in every situation 
 No matter what you're facing everyday 
 But it's up to you 
 You get to choose 
 The Father is waiting there with open arms 
 Dear John, People hurt you 
 And you know I've been hurt too 
 There's no way to escape it, 
 Don't let your pain be wasted 
 No, don't let it get the best of you 
 'Cause God took my broken parts 
 And gave me a brand new start 
 Now I am walking, breathing, living proof 
 And, dear John, He can do this for you 
 There's freedom 
 On the other side of 
 Things that keep us tied up and afraid 
 There's hope in every situation 
 No matter what you're facing everyday 
 But it's up to you 
 You get to choose 
 The Father is waiting there with open arms 
 Dear John, It's a not a list of do's and don'ts 
 Not a record of your faults 
 He gave his life pay it all 
 Dear John, He loves you just the way you are 
 You are forgiven by His scars 
 Just open up your heart, your heart 
 There's freedom 
 On the other side of 
 Things that keep us tied up and afraid 
 There's hope in every situation 
 No matter what you're facing everyday 
 But it's up to you 
 You get to choose 
 The Father is waiting there with open arms 
 Dear John, dear John, dear John, dear John...

Some days, I dream about Heaven 
 And some days, I wonder what it's gonna be like 
 When I'm leaving behind 
 The pain of this life 
 And sin is just a memory 
 'Cause one day I'll get to look You in the eyes 
 I can't wait to be where You are 
 Close enough to feel Your heart 
 Face 2 face 
 Face 2 face 
 With You, my Savior 
 I'm learning that the world I know 
 Is never gonna feel like home 
 Till I'm face 2 face 
 Face 2 face 
 With You, my Savior 
 Some days, the world is just too much to take 
 And some days, I'm barely hanging by a thread 
 But I won't let all of my fear, cripple me here 
 When I should be rejoicing 
 'Cause I know the beauty that waits ahead 
 I just wanna be where You are 
 Close enough to feel Your heart 
 Face 2 face 
 Face 2 face 
 With You, my Savior 
 I'm learning that the world I know 
 Is never gonna feel like home 
 Till I'm face 2 face 
 Face 2 face 
 With You, my Savior 
 We'll sing Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Like a sea of voices praising Your name 
 Every nation, every tongue, will bring You glory 
 And we will worship You, our God, Face 2 face 
 I can't wait to be where You are 
 Close enough to feel Your heart 
 Face 2 face 
 Face 2 face 
 With You, my Savior 
 I'm learning that the world I know 
 Is never gonna feel like home 
 Till I'm face 2 face 
 Face 2 face 
 With You, my Savior 
 Can't wait to be with You 
 Face 2 face

Praise to the Lord, our chains are gone 
 Can't help but sing our freedom song 
 Praise to the Lord, our chains are gone 
 Can't help but sing our freedom... 
 I am a child from a broken home 
 Where true love was torn apart 
 But then I met a Heavenly Father 
 Who made a home inside my heart 
 I am a man with the chains of addiction 
 Dragging me down for way too long 
 But I came face to face with redemption 
 And now those chains are gone 
 Can anybody hear me? 
 Does anybody know what I'm talking about? 
 When you've been delivered like that 
 You've got to shout it out 
 Lift your hands up in the air 
 Shout Hallelujah 
 Lift your hands up in the air 
 I have been set free 
 I am a sixteen year old daughter 
 Lost in the mirror, no self esteem 
 But God made me in His image 
 And that makes me a beauty queen 
 I am a wife and the mother of three 
 Trading my dreams for a busy life 
 Searching for my lost identity 
 And I'm happy to announce that I found it in Christ 
 Praise to the Lord, my chains are gone 
 Can't help but sing our freedom song 
 Praise to the Lord, my chains are gone 
 Can't help but sing our freedom song

Have you ever heard a love song 
 That set your spirit free 
 Have you ever watched a sunrise 
 And felt you could not breathe 
 What if it's Him 
 What if it's God speaking 
 Have you ever cried a tear that 
 You could not explain 
 Have you ever met a stranger 
 That already knew your name 
 What if it's Him 
 What if it's God speaking 
 Who knows how He'll get a hold of us 
 Get our attention to prove He is enough 
 He'll do and He'll use 
 Whatever He wants to 
 To tell us I love you 
 Have you ever lost a loved one 
 Who you thought should still be here 
 Do you know what it feels like 
 To be tangled up in fear 
 What if He's somehow involved 
 What if He's speaking through it all 
 His ways are higher 
 His ways are better 
 Though sometimes strange 
 What could be stranger 
 Than God in a manger 
 God is speaking 
 I love you

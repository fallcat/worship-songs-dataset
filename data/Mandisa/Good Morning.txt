Wave away my yesterday 
 'Cause I'm leaving it behind me. 
 Hello sunshine, come what may. 
 I feel something new inside me. 
 I hear the birds singing 
 Now my alarm's ringing 
 Get up, get up, hey! 
 It's a good morning! 
 Wake up to a brand new day 
 This morning, 
 I'm stepping, stepping on my way 
 Good morning, 
 You give me strength, 
 You give me just what I need 
 And I can feel the hope that's rising in me. 
 It's a good morning 
 Slow down, breathe in, 
 Don't move ahead 
 I'm just living in this moment 
 I've got my arms raised, un-phased 
 Jump out of bed 
 Gotta get this party going 
 I went to bed dreaming, 
 You woke me up singing 
 Get up, get up, hey! 
 It's a good morning! 
 Wake up to a brand new day 
 This morning, 
 I'm stepping, stepping on my way 
 Good morning, 
 You give me strength, 
 You give me just what I need 
 And I can feel the hope that's rising up in me. 
 It's a good morning 
 Now I'm smiling, and I'm kissing all my worries goodbye 
 Got the feeling, if I spread my wings I might even fly 
 You are my truth, my way 
 Give me the strength to say 
 Get up, get up, get up 
 'Cause it's a good morning, hey

 Hey, top of the morning to you 'disa 
 You smoothie, me ice cold pizza 
 Cafe au lait, latte dah 
 You do the zumba, but I do not 
 Give me like half a marathon, 
 I'll give you the gospel of St. John. 
 Hits me like a wake-up bomb 
 'Cause we both know that His mercy flows, 
 In the morning. 
 Wake up to a brand new day 
 This morning, 
 I'm stepping, stepping on my way 
 Good morning, 
 You give me strength, 
 You give me just what I need 
 I can feel the hope that's rising up in me. 
 It's a good morning 
 Wake up to a brand new day 
 This morning, 
 I'm stepping, stepping on my way 
 Good morning, 
 You give me strength you give me just what I need 
 I can feel the hope that's rising up in me. 
 It's a good morning 
 (Toby Mac) 
 Top of the morning to you 'disa 
 Hey, top of the morning to you girl 
 To-to-top of the morning to you 'disa 
 Morning little Miss Sunshine.

 Man, you morning people. 
 No, I'm serious.

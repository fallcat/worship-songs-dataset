There's a time to live 
 And a time to die 
 There's a time to laugh 
 And a time to cry 
 There's a time for war 
 And a time for peace 
 There's a hand to hold 
 In the worst of these 
 He is with you when your faith is dead 
 And you can't even get out of bed 
 Or your husband doesn't kiss you anymore 
 He is with you when your baby's gone 
 And your house is still, and your heart's a stone 
 Cryin' God, what'd You do that for 
 He is with you 
 There's a time for yes 
 And a time for no 
 There's a time to be angry 
 And a time to let it go 
 There is a time to run 
 And a time to face it 
 There is love to see you 
 Through all of this 
 He is with you in the conference room 
 When the world is coming down on you 
 And your wife and kids don't know you anymore 
 He is with you in the ICU 
 When the doctors don't know what to do 
 And it scares you to the core 
 He is with you 
 We may weep for a time 
 But joy will come in the morning 
 The morning light 
 He is with you when your kids are grown 
 When there's too much space and you feel alone 
 And you're worried if you got it right or wrong 
 Yes He is with you when you've given up 
 On ever finding your true love 
 Someone who feels like home 
 He is with you 
 When nothing else is left 
 And you take your final breath 
 He is with you

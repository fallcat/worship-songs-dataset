If what you thought was the truth is a lie 
 And what you fought to keep on breathing has died 
 You face the lonely nights and wrestle with the dark 
 And you reach to find the love to fill the space inside your heart 
 It's hard to put it into words the way you feel 
 It's an ache and emptiness that lingers still 
 Are you a victim of the past without a trace of hope in sight? 
 And it all goes by so fast without a way to make it right 
 If you worry, don't worry 
 God will come and wrap His arms around you 
 It wouldn't be too much 
 For Him to love you as He found you 
 And it may seem like you're too far gone 
 But He loves you like His only Son 
 And He will come 
 He will come 
 From the bounty of a river there's a flow 
 And from the beauty of the Father's heart's a home 
 That never leaves you empty no, and never leaves you bare 
 So come and bring your guilt and shame 
 Come and leave it there 
 If you're willing, He is willing 
 Oh, you don't have to be worthy 
 You don't have to be anything but willing to fall into His arms 
 Willing to fall into His arms

How much, how much 
 Do you really know how much, how much 
 Well, let me tell you how much, how much you are loved 
 These words go out to anyone who's ever felt so unlovable 
 I'd just like to say to you 
 That lie is so not true 
 This message is for the broken down 
 They say you can't turn your life around 
 No matter what you do 
 Well, that lie is so not true 
 Take the depths of the deepest ocean and go deeper 
 Take the top of the tallest tower and go higher 
 Take the best day that you've ever had 
 Try to imagine better than that 
 And it still don't come close 
 To how much you are loved 
 Don't worry about what you've done 
 God's love goes out to everyone 
 And here's the wonderful, beautiful truth 
 That includes me and you 
 So, let it find you where you are 
 Wrap it's arms around your weary heart 
 And all the love you're longing for 
 You'll find all that love and more 
 No heart is big enough 
 To measure Heaven's love 
 'Cause it goes on and on forever and ever and ever

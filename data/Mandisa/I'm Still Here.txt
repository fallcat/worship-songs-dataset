Yesterday 
 Had me knocked to the ground 
 Had me down for the count 
 My faith a million miles away 
 And I dropped outta sight 
 This overcomer, lost her will to fight 
 I know it's been a while since 
 Anybody see me smile and 
 Shame had me thinking it was 
 Game over 
 Thought my best days were gone, yeah 
 Turns out, that I was wrong 'cause 
 This is my comeback song, yeah 
 And by the grace of God 
 I'm still here 
 Hope is rising, waking up my soul 
 I'm still here 
 All my broken, turning beautiful 
 'Cause I feel my heartbeat beating 
 And my lungs breathe breathing 
 Guess my God's not done with me yet 
 I'm still here 
 All my yesterdays are gone 
 And the best is yet to come 
 Now I see 
 There's a reason I survived 
 There's a story still to write 
 His grace is working everything 
 Everything for my good 
 In a way that, only He could 
 I know it's been a while since 
 Anybody's seen me smile and 
 Shame had me thinking it was 
 Game over 
 Thought my best days were gone, yeah 
 Turns out, that I was wrong 'cause 
 This is my comeback song 
 I'm still here (I'm still here) 
 Hope is rising, waking up my soul 
 I'm still here (I'm still here) 
 All my broken, turning beautiful 
 'Cause I feel my heart beat beating 
 And my lungs breathe breathing 
 Guess my God's not done with me yet (done with me yet) 
 I'm still here (I'm still here) 
 All my yesterdays are gone 
 And the best is yet to come 
 He lifted me up (He lifted me up) 
 Out of the pit 
 All glory to God 
 I will sing it again 
 He lifted me up (yeah) 
 Out of the pit 
 All glory to God 
 And the best is yet to come 
 The best is yet to come 
 I'm still here (I'm still here) 
 Hope is rising, waking up my soul (waking up my soul) 
 I'm still here (I'm still here) 
 All my broken, turning beautiful 
 'Cause I feel my heart beat beating 
 And my lungs breathe breathing 
 Guess my God's not done with me yet (done with me yet) 
 'Cause I'm still here (I'm still here) 
 All my yesterdays are gone 
 And the best is yet to come 
 The best is yet to come

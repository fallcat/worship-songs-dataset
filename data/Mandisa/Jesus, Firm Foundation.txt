How firm a foundation, you saints of the lord 
 Is laid for your faith in his excellent word 
 What more can he say than to you he has said 
 To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled 
 Fear not, he is with us, oh be not dismayed 
 For he is our god, our sustainer and strength 
 He'll be our defender and cause us to stand 
 Upheld by his merciful, almighty hand 
 How firm, our foundation 
 How sure, our salvation 
 And we will not be shaken 
 Jesus, firm foundation 
 The soul that is trusting in Jesus as lord 
 Will press on enduring the darkest of storm 
 And though even hell should endeavor to shake 
 He'll never, no never, no no never forsake 
 He'll never, no never, no no never forsake 
 How firm, our foundation 
 How sure, our salvation 
 And we will not be shaken 
 Jesus, firm foundation 
 Age to age he stands 
 Faithful to the end 
 All may fade away 
 But he will remain 
 He will remain! 
 How firm, our foundation 
 How sure, our salvation 
 And we will not be shaken 
 Jesus, firm foundation.

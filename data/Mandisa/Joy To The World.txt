Joy to the world, the Lord is come 
 Let earth receive her King 
 Let every heart prepare Him room 
 And heaven and nature sing 
 And heaven and nature sing 
 And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing 
 Joy to the world, the Savior reigns 
 Let men their songs employ 
 While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy 
 Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel 
 Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel 
 He rules the world with truth and grace 
 And He makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders, wonders of His love 
 Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel 
 Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel 
 Joy to the world, the Lord is come 
 Let earth receive her King, let us see 
 He gives us joy, He gives us peace 
 Let heaven and nature sing to the King 
 He gives us joy, let's all of us bring 
 Praise, praise, praise to the King, to the King 
 He gives us joy, joy, joy 
 Let heaven and nature sing to the King 
 He gives us joy, let's all of us bring 
 Praise to it's King 'cause He gives us joy, joy, joy

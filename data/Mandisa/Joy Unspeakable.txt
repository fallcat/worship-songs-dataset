This is not another song 
 About all we've done wrong 
 We already know 
 I think it's time for us 
 To find the freedom in the trust 
 Of letting go 
 Let's take some time 
 To thank Him for the blessings 
 Let's go big tonight 
 With all our hearts adore Him 
 With joy unspeakable 
 Let's get on our feet 
 Movin' to the beat 
 Wave our hands high in the air 
 Celebrate His love 
 Grace that is enough 
 Give Him all of our cares 
 With joy unspeakable, joy unspeakable 
 Let's raise our voices to the One 
 Because He is worthy of 
 All of our praise 
 He's given us a second chance 
 Turned our sadness into dance 
 We have been changed 
 Let's take this time 
 To thank Him for the blessings 
 Let's go big tonight 
 With all our hearts adore Him 
 With joy unspeakable 
 Let's get on our feet 
 Movin' to the beat 
 Wave our hands high in the air 
 Celebrate His love 
 Grace that is enough 
 Give Him all of our cares 
 With joy unspeakable, joy unspeakable 
 With joy unspeakable, joy unspeakable 
 You and I were made for more 
 Can't imagine what's in store 
 We were meant to soar 
 Like an eagle 
 Leave religion at the door 
 Raise the roof and shake the floor 
 Let's get loud and let's explore 
 Joy unspeakable... 
 Joy unspeakable 
 Let's get on our feet 
 Movin' to the beat 
 Wave our hands high in the air 
 Celebrate His love 
 Grace that is enough 
 Give Him all of our cares 
 With joy unspeakable, joy unspeakable

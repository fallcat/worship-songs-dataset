Why you gotta act so strong? 
 Go ahead and take off your brave face 
 Why you telling me that nothing's wrong 
 It's obvious your not in a good place 
 Who's telling you to keep it all inside 
 And never let those feelings 
 Get past the corner of your eye 
 You don't need to run 
 You don't need to speak 
 Baby take some time 
 Let those prayers roll down your cheek 
 It maybe tomorrow 
 You'll be past the sorrow 
 But tonight it's alright 
 Just cry 
 I know you know your Sunday songs 
 A dozen verses by memory 
 Yeah they're good but life is hard 
 And days get long 
 You gotta know God can handle your honesty 
 So feel the things your feeling 
 Name your fears and doubts 
 Don't stuff your shame and sadness, loneliness and anger 
 Let it out, let it out 
 You don't need to run 
 You don't need to speak 
 Baby take some time 
 Let those prayers roll down your cheek 
 It maybe tomorrow 
 You'll be past the sorrow 
 But tonight it's alright 
 Just cry 
 Just cry 
 It doesn't mean you don't trust him 
 It doesn't mean you don't believe 
 It doesn't mean you don't know 
 He's redeeming everything. 
 You don't need to run 
 You don't need to speak 
 Baby take some time 
 Let those prayers roll down your cheek 
 It maybe tomorrow 
 You'll be past the sorrow 
 But tonight it's alright 
 But tonight it's alright 
 Just cry 
 Why you gotta act so strong 
 Go ahead and take off your brave face

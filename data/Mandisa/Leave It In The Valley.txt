I got your message on the phone so tell me what's going on? 
 You say your day started so great and then it went so wrong 
 No one ever plans for the bad days, do they, no 
 But I am here if you're needing a friend 
 Hey, don't give up tonight 
 I know you're going through the valley, but you're gonna make it out alright 
 Hey, tell your troubles goodbye 
 Go on and leave it in the valley, leave it in the valley tonight 
 So you think He don't know what He's doing 
 You think He ain't by your side 
 Well, God knows when you're broken 
 And He's loving you, He's holding you so, so tight 
 So let the rain fall He'll be standing there getting wet with you 
 You might get cold but you won't be there alone 
 And when you're hanging by a thread hold on 
 You know the darkest part is right before the dawn 
 So when your fear has worn you out 
 Feels like the sky is on the ground 
 He ain't gonna let you down 
 He'll never let you down

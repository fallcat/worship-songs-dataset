Here I am 
 Drowning in a sea of my own choices 
 Holdin' to a hope by a thread 
 Yeah 
 I'm lookin' round 
 I'm callin out, fear pulls me down 
 When the waters rush over my head 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my rescue 
 Strength in my weakness 
 Light in my darkness 
 You are my safety 
 Lifter of my head 
 The air that I need when 
 I can't seem to breathe in 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my lifeline 
 How many times 
 How many turns will it take till I learn 
 You reach for me in my need 
 And when I cry I will faithfully find you 
 When life comes crashin on me 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my rescue 
 Strength in my weakness 
 Light in my darkness 
 You are my safety 
 Lifter of my head 
 The air that I need when 
 I can't seem to breathe in 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my lifeline 
 Your there in my brokenness 
 And my distress 
 My rock when I'm stronger when I'm powerless 
 You hold me and rush when tides and waters rise 
 And I always find 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my rescue 
 Strength in my weakness 
 Light in my darkness 
 You are my safety 
 Lifter of my head 
 The air that I need when 
 I can't seem to breathe in 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my rescue 
 Strength in my weakness 
 Light in my darkness 
 You are my safety 
 Lifter of my head 
 The air that I need when 
 I can't seem to breathe in 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my lifeline 
 You are my lifeline!

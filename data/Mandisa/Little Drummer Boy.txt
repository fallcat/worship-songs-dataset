 Come they told me 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 A new born King to see 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Our finest gifts we bring 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 To lay before the King 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Rum, pum, pum, pum 
 So to honor Him 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 When we come 
 Baby, Jesu 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 I am a poor boy too 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 I have no gift to bring 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 That's fit to give a king 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Shall I play for you 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 On my drum? 
 Mary nodded 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 The ox and lamb kept time 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 I played my drum for Him 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 I played my best for Him 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Then He smiled at me 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Me and my drum 
 Then He smiled at me 
 Pa rum, pum, pum, pum 
 Me and my drum

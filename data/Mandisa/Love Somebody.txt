I need a minute 
 Can we get some time 
 We both know we don't see eye to eye 
 I know it's hard on us when we disagree 
 But don't you think that you and me could take a chance and 
 Love somebody 
 Somebody needs you 
 You could be the one to 
 Love somebody 
 Take a chance and pass it on 
 You could be the one to love 
 I had a dream just the other day 
 With blinded eyes we let 
 Real love guide the way 
 Nobody felt we had to look the same or talk the game 
 We found true beauty and we weren't afraid to go ahead and 
 Love somebody 
 Somebody needs you 
 You could be the one to 
 Love somebody 
 Take a chance and pass it on 
 You could be the one to 
 Love somebody 
 Somebody needs you 
 You could be the one to love 
 If Mandisa ain't changed your mind 
 It oughta be flipped by the end of this rhyme 
 'Cause she gave me eight to flow and translate 
 Recalibrate end all debates 
 'Cause this bomb is about to drop y'all 
 Diverse City just can't be stopped 
 So here we go, come check the show 
 Come one, come all, come overflow with love

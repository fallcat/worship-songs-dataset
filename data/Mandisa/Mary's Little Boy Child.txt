Long time ago in Bethlehem 
 So the Holy Nible say 
 Mary's boy child Jesus Christ 
 Was born on Christmas day 
 Hark now hear the angels sing 
 A new king born today 
 And man will live forevermore 
 Because of Christmas day 
 Trumpets sound and angels sing 
 Listen what they say 
 That man will live forevermore 
 Because of Christmas day 
 While shepherds watch their flock by night 
 They see a bright new shining star 
 Then hear a choir sing 
 The music seemed to come from afar 
 Now Joseph and his wife Mary 
 Come to Bethlehem that night 
 Then find no place to born the child 
 Not a single room was in sight 
 Hark now hear the angels sing 
 A new king born today 
 And man will live forevermore 
 Because of Christmas day 
 Trumpets sound and angels sing 
 Listen what they say 
 That man will live forevermore 
 Because of Christmas day 
 By and by they find a little nook 
 In a stable all forlorn 
 And in a manger cold and dark 
 Mary's little boy was born

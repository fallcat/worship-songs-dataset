I was so helpless 
 Where did the light go 
 I had no hope left 
 Deep down in my soul 
 I was watchin' 
 I was waitin' 
 I was prayin' 
 I was stayin' down on my knees 
 That's right where You found me 
 My Deliverer, You rescued me from all that held me captive 
 My Deliverer, You set me free 
 Now I'm alive and I can live 
 So every moment I will give you praise 
 My Deliverer 
 Ooh my Deliverer 
 There's no pretending 
 I can't do it myself 
 I'm so dependent 
 Lord I need Your help 
 I'll be watchin' 
 I'll be waitin' 
 I'll be prayin' 
 I'll be stayin' down on my knees 
 That's right where You'll find me 
 My Deliverer, You rescued me from all that held me captive 
 My Deliverer, You set me free 
 Now I'm alive and I can live 
 And every moment I will give you praise 
 La la la la la I need You 
 You know whatever I'm goin' through 
 I'll be watchin' 
 I'll be waitin' 
 I'll be prayin' 
 I'll be stayin' down on my knees 
 That's right where You'll find me 
 My Deliverer, You rescued me from all that held me captive 
 My Deliverer, You set me free 
 Now I can live 
 My Deliverer, I'm no longer captive 
 My Deliverer, You gave Your life that I might live 
 So every moment I will give you praise 
 Yeah my Deliverer 
 I'm gonna give You praise 
 I'm gonna give You praise 
 My Deliverer

I stand accused 
 There's a list a mile long 
 Of all my sins 
 Of everything that I've done wrong 
 I'm so ashamed 
 There's nowhere left for me to hide 
 This is the day 
 I must answer for my life 
 My fate is in the Judge's hands 
 But then He turns to me and says 
 I know you 
 I love you 
 I gave My life to save you 
 Love paid the price for mercy 
 My verdict not guilty 
 How can it be? 
 I can't begin to comprehend 
 What kind of grace 
 Would take the place of all my sin? 
 I stand in awe 
 Now that I have been set free 
 And the tears well up as I look at that cross 
 'Cause it should have been me 
 My fate was in the nail scarred hands 
 He stretched them out for me and said 
 I'm falling on my knees to thank You 
 With everything I am I'll praise You 
 So grateful for the words I heard You say

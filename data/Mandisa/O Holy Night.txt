O holy night 
 The stars are brightly shining 
 It is the night 
 Of our dear Savior's birth 
 Long lay the world 
 In sin and error pining 
 'Til He appeared 
 And the soul felt its worth 
 A thrill of hope 
 The weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks 
 A new and glorious morn 
 Fall on your knees 
 Oh, hear the angel voices 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh, night divine 
 Truly He taught us 
 To love one another 
 His law is love 
 And His gospel is peace 
 Chains shall He break 
 For the slave is our brother 
 And in His name 
 All oppression shall cease 
 Sweet hymns of joy 
 In grateful chorus raise we 
 Let all within us 
 Praise His holy name 
 Fall on your knees 
 Don't you hear the angel voices? 
 Oh, night divine 
 Oh, Christ is the Lord 
 Let's praise His name forever 
 His power and glory evermore proclaim 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born 
 Oh, night divine

I remember feeling like I was all alone 
 Couldn't ever give anybody else control 
 Heavy burdens always seemed to weigh me down 
 I called out, "save me now" 
 There You were to catch me when I couldn't stand 
 'Cause I was falling, falling with no way to land 
 I'm amazed by Your everlasting love 
 Your strength lifted me up 
 Oh, my Lord, You gone and set me free 
 Oh, my Lord ain't nothing holding on me 
 Oh, my Lord it's a brand new day 
 Somebody raise your hands and sing, "Oh, my Lord" 
 Since I met You, I have been forever changed 
 Let the water rise, I don't have to be afraid 
 You know I'll praise You every season of my life 
 My Jesus, I'll testify 
 You saved me, forgave me, and now I believe 
 I belong to the King of kings

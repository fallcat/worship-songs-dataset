Been a hard one, Been a bad one 
 Been a tough one, Been a sad one 
 It's been one of those days that keeps chipping away at my heart 
 Nothing new here, It's what I do here 
 It's a stereotypical day, in the life 
 I'm surrounded by all of the pain and the strife 
 But I know it's all right, whoa oh 
 'Cause it's only the world I'm living in 
 It's only today I've been given 
 There ain't no way I'm giving in 
 'Cause it's only the world (oh 'cause it's only the world) 
 I know the best is still yet to come 
 Cause even when my days in the world are done 
 There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me 
 Do do do do do do do do do, yeah its only the world 
 Anybody can you hear me? 
 Do you feel me? I mean, do you feel me? 
 I know I'm not the only one wearing the weight of this world 
 We got problems (said it's all right) 
 Just remember (yeah, it's all right) 
 Take a good look around we're just stuck on the ground for a little while 
 Don't it make you smile 
 'Cause it's only the world I'm living in (Yeah) 
 It's only today I've been given (Yeah) 
 There ain't no way I'm giving in 
 Oh 'Cause it's only the world (only the world) 
 I know the best is still yet to come 
 Cause even when my days in the world are done 
 There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me 
 Do do do do do do do do do, yeah its only the world (Yeah) 
 Do do do do do do do do do, yeah its only the world (Oh it's only the world) 
 Heaven is a place where the tears on every face will be wiped away 
 Oh And I can't wait to go, but for now it's enough to know 
 This is only temporary this is only, Yeah, All right! 
 'Cause it's only the world I'm living in 
 It's only the day I've been given 
 There ain't no way I'm giving in 
 'Cause it's only the world (only the world) 
 I know the best is still yet to come 
 Cause even when my days in the world are done 
 There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me 
 'Cause it's only the world I'm living in 
 It's only the day I've been given 
 There ain't no way I'm giving in 
 'Cause it's only the world (only the world) 
 I know the best is still yet to come 
 Cause even when my days in the world are done 
 There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me

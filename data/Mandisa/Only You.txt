I've had days that felt like a thousand years 
 And years that just fly by 
 I've had times I've been so sure in life 
 And then nothing worked out right 
 I put my hope in so many things I thought that I would need 
 But it doesn't mean anything, anything, anything to me 
 I've been around a crowd of people 
 And felt so all alone 
 Tried to give up being different 
 So that I could just belong 
 Some have tried to tell me who I'm supposed to be 
 But it doesn't mean anything, anything to me 
 Only You, You satisfy 
 Only You are the love of my life 
 If I got everything I want, no, it still wouldn't do 
 I got a whole lotta' nothing if I don't got You 
 When then mirror doesn't match the cover of a magazine 
 And I'm consumed with all of my fears and insecurities 
 'Cause I had my idol for a while, but now I finally I see 
 That it didn't mean anything, anything, no 
 A whole lotta nothing 
 Oh Lord, I believe it's a 
 Whole lotta nothing 
 If You ain't close to me

Staring at a stop sign 
 Watching people drive by 
 T. Mac on the radio 
 Got so much on your mind 
 Nothing's really going right 
 Looking for a ray of hope 
 Whatever it is you may be going through 
 I know He's not gonna let it get the best of you 
 You're an overcomer 
 Stay in the fight until the final round 
 You're not going under 
 'Cause God is holding you right now 
 You might be down for a moment 
 Feeling like it's hopeless 
 That's when He reminds You 
 That you're an overcomer 
 You're an overcomer 
 Everybody's been down 
 Hit the bottom, hit the ground 
 Oh, you're not alone 
 Just take a breath, don't forget 
 Hang on to His promises 
 He wants You to know 
 You're an overcomer 
 Stay in the fight until the final round 
 You're not going under 
 'Cause God is holding you right now 
 You might be down for a moment 
 Feeling like it's hopeless 
 That's when He reminds You 
 That you're an overcomer 
 You're an overcomer 
 The same Man, the Great I am 
 The one who overcame death 
 Is living inside of You 
 So just hold tight, fix your eyes 
 On the one who holds your life 
 There's nothing he can't do 
 He's telling you 
 You're an overcomer 
 Stay in the fight until the final round 
 You're not going under 
 'Cause God is holding you right now 
 You might be down for a moment 
 Feeling like it's hopeless 
 That's when He reminds You 
 That you're an overcomer 
 You're an overcomer 
 So don't quit, don't give in 
 You're an overcomer

I wonder if you think of me like I think of you 
 Do you long for my touch 
 I'll honor you with purity, 
 So you can have all of me 
 Am I saying too much? 
 For now I'm waiting, anticipating 
 Baby, I know that you'll be 
 The one that's strong when I am weak 
 I'll love you through the good and the bad 
 For rich or for poor 
 May not have much but this I'm sure 
 Till my dream comes true 
 I'll be praying for you, praying for you 
 I wonder what's in store for me 
 Who you're gonna be 
 Have you ever passed me by 
 And I know that you are working hard 
 For our picket fence and yard 
 Maybe a little girl and boy 
 But for now, I'm waiting, oh anticipating 
 Baby, I know that you'll be 
 The one that's strong when I am weak 
 I'll love you through the good and the bad 
 For rich or for poor 
 May not have much but this I'm sure 
 Till my dream comes true 
 I'll be praying for you, praying for you 
 That you will fear the Lord 
 I'll pray we'll be on one accord 
 That God will bless everything we do 
 I pray that He will shield your heart 
 That we will not be torn apart 
 And side by side in Jesus' name we'll stand 
 But for now we're waiting, anticipating 
 For rich or for poor 
 May not have much but this I'm sure 
 Till my dream comes true 
 I'll be praying for you 
 Everyday I'm praying for you

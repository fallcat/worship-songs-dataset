When I'm alone, when I'm afraid 
 When I have had all I can take 
 Losing my grip, I start to slip away 
 When I can hear the voice of doubt 
 Inside my head, screaming loud 
 Strengthen my faith, and help me say 
 Today, today 
 I will follow, I will press on 
 Even when the walk feels long 
 Your hands hold me together 
 Your love is with me forever 
 Through the broken, through the victory 
 I will praise You through it all 
 And run hard till the race is done 
 I, I'm gonna press on, press on 
 I'm gonna press on, press on 
 How many storms have I been through 
 How many led me right to You 
 You're using the pain, the hardest days 
 For my good, my good 
 So what do I fear 
 God, You are with me 
 Guiding my steps today 
 Through the mountains, valleys, sun and rain 
 Lord, lead the way, lead the way 
 I will follow, I will press on 
 Even when the walk feels long 
 Your hands hold me together 
 Your love is with me forever 
 Through the broken, through the victory 
 I will praise You through it all 
 And run hard till the race is done 
 I, I'm gonna press on, press on 
 One step in front of the other 
 No looking back, no looking back 
 One step in front of the other 
 I'm gonna press on, I'm gonna press on 
 I'm gonna press on, I'm gonna press on 
 I will follow, I will press on 
 Even when the walk feels long 
 Your hands hold me together 
 Your love is with me forever 
 Through the broken, through the victory 
 I will praise You through it all 
 And run hard till the race is done 
 I, I'm gonna press on, press on 
 I'm gonna press on, press on 
 One step in front of the other 
 No looking back, no looking back 
 One step in front of the other 
 I'm gonna press on, I'm gonna press on

You could've healed her 
 You've done it before 
 You could've sent the angels down 
 And turned it around 
 Wouldn't that have meant so much more? 
 Instead you took her 
 Left a young family behind 
 And I'm wondering where you are 
 You seem so far 
 While we're all here asking why 
 And I've read your ways are higher 
 But I just don't understand 
 Trying to hold onto my faith, but 
 It's slipping through my hands 
 Prove me wrong 
 Prove me wrong 
 These waves will take me under 
 My heart will not get over 
 And this pain won't make me strong 
 Prove me wrong 
 Would it be wrong if 
 I asked you for proof 
 I wish that I could just believe, without questioning 
 I'm just being honest with you 
 And they say your ways are better 
 But I still don't understand 
 And you can't hold me together 
 And this can't be your perfect plan 
 Prove me wrong 
 Prove me wrong 
 All this pain 
 This sorrow in my heart 
 I can't find my way out of the dark 
 Prove me wrong 
 Prove me wrong 
 You know my doubts and fears 
 I need to know you're here 
 Still the storm that rages on 
 Or these waves will take me under 
 My heart will not get over 
 This pain won't make me strong 
 Prove me wrong 
 Prove me wrong

To the voice to the liar in the mirror 
 Sayin' you can't ever change 
 To the guilt that's sittin' on your shoulder 
 Always keepin' you locked in chains 
 To the past that you can't undo 
 To the pain that you're walkin' through 
 To the small and the big mistakes 
 This is what love wants to say 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 To the one that used to be 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Everyday is a brand new mercy 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 This is where it starts now 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 Everything can turn around 
 In a moment, here's your moment 
 You can say goodbye 
 There is grace that you can't imagine 
 There is love that you can't out run 
 There is peace that you can hold onto 
 When your world is comin' undone 
 You don't have give into the fear 
 Don't have to have let your story stop here 
 And when the hand tries to pull you back 
 You don't have to back, you don't have to go back 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 To the one that used to be 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Everyday is a brand new mercy 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 This is where it starts now 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 Everything can turn around 
 In a moment, here's your moment 
 You can say goodbye 
 To everything that breaks you down 
 It doesn't have to define you now 
 Jesus came to take it all away 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 To the one that used to be 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Everyday is a brand new mercy 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 This is where it starts now 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 Everything can turn around 
 In a moment, here's your moment 
 You can say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 You're not the one you used to be 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Everyday is a brand new mercy 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 This is where it starts now 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 Everything can turn around 
 In a moment, here's the moment 
 Where you say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye

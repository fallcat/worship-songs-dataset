Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance 
 I just wanna praise You 
 I just wanna praise You 
 You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands 
 And I'm gonna praise You 
 I'm gonna praise You 
 In the corners of mind 
 I just can't seem to find a reason to believe 
 That I can break free 
 'Cause you see I have been down for so long 
 Feel like all hope is gone 
 But as I lift my hands, I understand 
 That I should praise You through my circumstance 
 Everything that could go wrong 
 All went wrong at one time 
 So much pressure fell on me 
 I thought I was gonna lose my mind 
 But I know You wanna see 
 If I will hold on through these trials 
 But I need You to lift this load 
 'Cause I can't take it no more 
 Been through the fire and the rain 
 Bound in every kind of way 
 But God has broken every chain 
 So let me go

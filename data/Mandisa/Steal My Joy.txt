I look at my life 
 And I still can't believe it 
 How did I make it 
 To where I stand now? 
 You don't understand 
 I was up against the whole world 
 And all I could feel was it breaking me down 
 But out of a hopeless situation 
 There came a song of redemption 
 Life may push my heart to the limit 
 But I won't let go 
 Of the joy in my soul 
 'Cause everything can change in a minute 
 And the world may try 
 But they're never gonna steal my joy 
 So get up, stand up 
 And rise above it 
 If every plan 
 That you've made goes so wrong 
 You don't have to give in to the struggle 
 You may be down 
 But don't stay there for long 
 In every hopeless situation 
 There is a song of redemption 
 The world may say 
 You're never gonna make it 
 The world may say 
 You're not strong enough to take it 
 But I don't care 
 'Cause the joy of the Lord is real 
 And they're never gonna steal my joy

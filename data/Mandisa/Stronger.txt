Hey, heard you were up all night 
 Thinking about how your world ain't right 
 And you wonder if things will ever get better 
 And you're asking why is it always raining on you 
 When all you want is just a little good news 
 Instead of standing there stuck out in the weather 
 Oh, don't hang your head 
 It's gonna end 
 God's right there 
 Even if it's hard to see Him 
 I promise you that He still cares 
 When the waves are taking you under 
 Hold on just a little bit longer 
 He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger 
 The pain ain't gonna last forever 
 And things can only get better 
 Believe me 
 This is gonna make you stronger 
 Gonna make you stronger, stronger, stronger 
 Believe me, this is gonna make you Stronger 
 Try and do the best you can 
 Hold on and let Him hold your hand 
 And go on and fall into the arms of Jesus 
 Oh, lift your head it's gonna end 
 God's right there 
 Even when you just can't feel Him 
 I promise you that He still cares 
 When the waves are taking you under 
 Hold on just a little bit longer 
 He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger 
 The pain ain't gonna last forever 
 And things can only get better 
 Believe me 
 This is gonna make you stronger 
 Gonna make you stronger, stronger, stronger 
 Believe me, this is gonna make you Stronger 
 'Cause if He started this work in your life 
 He will be faithful to complete it 
 If only you believe it 
 He knows how much it hurts 
 And I'm sure that He's gonna help you get through this 
 When the waves are taking you under 
 Hold on just a little bit longer 
 He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger 
 The pain ain't gonna last forever 
 In time it's gonna get better 
 Believe me 
 This is gonna make you stronger

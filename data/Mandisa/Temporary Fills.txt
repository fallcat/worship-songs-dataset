People goin' on and on 
 They don't know what they got wrong 
 This world won't keep you satisfied 
 You gotta buy this 
 Wear this, drive that car 
 'Cause that's the kind of thing 
 That makes you who you are 
 But don't keep throwin' that my way 
 No more temporary fills 
 I want a love that's real 
 Take everything I have and fill me up inside 
 I'm done looking for the quick fix 
 Jesus your love is all I'll ever need 
 No more temporary fills 
 I've turned every rock and stone 
 Gone everywhere there was to go 
 But I only felt better for a while 
 'Cause nothin' can replace you 
 Erase you from my heart 
 And that's the kind of thing 
 That makes you who you are 
 Your the reason I can say 
 No more temporary fills 
 I want a love that's real 
 Take everything I have and fill me up inside 
 I'm done looking for the quick fix 
 Jesus your love is all I'll ever need 
 And nothin' temporary could ever make me 
 Feel the way you do 
 'Cause what you've given to me 
 I know that it will last my whole life through 
 Whoa 
 No more temporary fills 
 I want a love that's real 
 Take everything I have and fill me up inside 
 I'm done looking for the quick fix 
 Jesus, your love is all I'll ever need 
 No more temporary fills 
 No more 
 No more 
 No more 
 No more hidin'

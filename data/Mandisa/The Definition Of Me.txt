Everbody's got an opinion 
 Of what they want me to be. 
 Everybody's got a condition 
 That I may never meet. 
 So tired of lookin' in the mirror 
 It always says the same thing 
 I wanna be about somethin' different 
 Somethin' more than the mirror can see. 
 Like Joy, Peace 
 Alive in me. 
 When it comes to my identity. 
 I want the love. 
 I want the life. 
 I want the beauty only inside. 
 I want the one that you can't see. 
 To be the definition of me. 
 More than the face. 
 More than the girl. 
 More than the voice. 
 More than the world. 
 I want the truth that I believe. 
 To be the definition of me. 
 Pretty is cool for a minute 
 But it always fades away. 
 Trends are hot for a second 
 Then they're gone the very next day. 
 So before you get lost in the moment 
 Let's get one thing clear. 
 That love will last forever. 
 It's the reason that we're here. 
 It's up to you. 
 Cause everybody's lookin'. 
 How do you want them to see? (yeah) 
 I want the love. 
 I want the life. 
 I want the beauty only inside. 
 I want the one that you can't see. 
 To be the definition of me. 
 More than the face. 
 More than the girl. 
 More than the voice. 
 More than the world. 
 I want the truth that I believe. 
 To be the definition of me. 
 Said I'm cute with the boots 
 And the trendy attire. 
 Said they're kinda remanicin 
 'Bout a younter Maraya. 
 But do they see beyond what I got 
 What I rock. 
 They'd be shocked if they knew 
 It was my soul that was hot. 
 Boys won't effect my own self respect. 
 And neither do the magazines at Vanity Tech. 
 Yo Disa make a list of what's fly 
 And what's next. 
 Start it off with Joy, Peace, 
 And end it with Blessed. 
 I want the love. 
 I want the life. 
 I want the beauty only inside. 
 I want the one that you can't see. 
 To be the definition of me. 
 More than the face. 
 More than the girl. 
 More than the voice. 
 More than the world. 
 I want the truth that I believe. 
 To be the definition of me. 
 I want you to be my definition. 
 De-de-definition. 
 Want you to be my definition. 
 Definition of me. 
 I want you to be my definition. 
 De-de-definition. 
 Want you to be my definition. 
 Definition of me.

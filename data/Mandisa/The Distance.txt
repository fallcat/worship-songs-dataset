I stood at a canyon 
 A great divide 
 Sin left me stranded 
 With You on the other side 
 I thought I was hopeless 
 But in my heart 
 I heard a still small voice 
 That was callin' my name 
 And all the miles between 
 Started melting away 
 Oh, it's amazing 
 Your love is erasing 
 The distance 
 And You won't stop, You won't stop 
 Even in my weakest moment 
 I can feel You closin' the distance 
 And You won't stop, You won't stop 
 Closin' the distance 
 You are relentless 
 You've always been 
 Pursuer of my heart 
 Over and over again 
 Oh, I hear the still small voice 
 And it's calling my name 
 I feel the miles between us 
 Melting away 
 And suddenly I can see 
 I was never alone 
 You've been reaching for me 
 And pulling me close 
 Oh, it's amazing 
 Your love is erasing 
 The distance 
 And You won't stop, You won't stop 
 Even in my weakest moment 
 I can feel You closin' the distance 
 And You won't stop, You won't stop 
 Nothing can separate us 
 No one can stand between 
 From beginning to the end 
 Your love is enough, enough 
 Nothing can separate us 
 No one can separate us 
 Oh, it's so amazing 
 How Your love is closin' the distance 
 Even in my weakest moment 
 I can feel You closin' the distance 
 And You won't stop, You won't stop 
 Closin' the distance 
 And You won't stop, You won't stop 
 Closin' the distance 
 And You won't stop, You won't stop 
 Closin' the distance 
 Closin' the distance

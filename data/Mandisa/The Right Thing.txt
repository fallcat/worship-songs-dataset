I've got all my excuses 
 I've got my list of fears 
 I've counted all the reasons 
 Why You called the wrong hero to be here 
 It's not safe, it's just not worth it 
 Doing the right thing is just too hard 
 But, I believed those lies for long enough 
 And I'm not going to listen anymore 
 Because I remember you said 
 When all hope is gone, help will come 
 And, give me strength to go farther 
 To climb higher 
 Courage that burns inside like a fire 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 I will do what I need to and when I need you 
 I know your love will come to the rescue 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 I'll do the right thing 
 I can do this, I can do this 
 I'm gonna do this, I can do the right thing 
 I can do this, let's do this 
 I wanna do this, I can do the right thing 
 So what if I'm not the strongest 
 A little weaker than I'd like to be 
 Well, even I can do what's right because I know 
 The king is calling me 
 To live a life worth looking up to 
 Holding onto what matters most 
 Nobody said it was going to be easy 
 But, I know I'll never be alone 
 'Cause when all hope is gone 
 Help will come, come from above 
 And, give me strength to go farther 
 To climb higher 
 Courage that burns inside like a fire 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 I will do what I need to and when I need you 
 I know your love will come to the rescue 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 I'll do the right thing 
 I can do this, I can do this 
 I can do this, I can do the right thing 
 I'm gonna do this, let's do this 
 I wanna do this, I can do the right thing 
 Do the right thing 
 (I can do) 
 Do the right thing 
 (The right thing) 
 Do the right thing 
 (Oh yeah) 
 And, give me strength to go farther 
 To climb higher 
 Courage that burns inside like a fire 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 I will do what I need to and when I need you 
 I know your love will come to the rescue 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 Give me strength to go farther 
 To climb higher 
 Courage that burns inside like a fire 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 I will do what I need to and when I need You 
 I know Your love will come to the rescue 
 No turning back, this is the day 
 I'll do the right thing 
 I can do this, I can do this 
 I can do this, I can do the right thing 
 I'm gonna do this, let's do this 
 I wanna do this, I can do the right thing

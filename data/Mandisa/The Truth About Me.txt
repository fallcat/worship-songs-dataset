If only I could see me as you see me 
 And understand the way that I am loved 
 Would it give a whole new meaning to my purpose 
 Change the way I see the world 
 Would I sparkle like a star in the night sky 
 Would I give a little more instead of take 
 If I understood I'm precious like the diamond 
 I'm a worth no one could estimate 
 I'm a worth no one could estimate 
 You say lovely 
 I say broken 
 I say guilty 
 You say forgiven 
 I feel lonely 
 Say you're with me 
 We both know it would change everything 
 If only I believed the truth about me 
 I wish I could hold on to the moments 
 When my life is spinnin but I'm peaceful still 
 Like a wind you whispered in the silence 
 And tell me things this world never will 
 You tell me things this world never will 
 You say lovely 
 I say broken 
 I say guilty 
 You say forgiven 
 I feel lonely 
 Say you're with me 
 We both know it would change everything 
 If only I believed the truth about me 
 I would sleep better at night 
 Wake up with hope for another day 
 I would love even if it cost me 
 Take a chance and know I'm goin' be ok 
 I would dare to give my life away... 
 Oh, I feel lonely 
 Say you're with me 
 We both know it would change everything 
 If only I believed the truth about me 
 If only I believed the truth about me

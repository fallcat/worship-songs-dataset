I never liked Mondays or bad news 
 Or breakin in new shoes 
 And mornings when I can't find my phone 
 Nobody likes traffic or short nights 
 Or situps or long flights 
 But sometimes that's just the way it goes 
 It's funny what you use to help me grow... 
 So I'll learn to love these days 
 Life along the way 
 In the middle of the crazy 
 God your love is so amazing 
 Through the ups and downs 
 You're the only hope I've found 
 The Lord you meet me in the madness 
 I'll learned to love these days 
 I'll learned to love these days 
 I can see a silver linin 
 When the sun's not shinin' 
 Even when you choose to bring the rain 
 Oh, but I'm trustin your leadin' 
 'Cause your Lord of all my joy and all my pain 
 So I'll learn to love these days 
 Life along the way 
 In the middle of the crazy 
 God, your love is so amazing 
 Through the ups and downs 
 You're the only hope I've found 
 The Lord you meet me in the madness 
 I'll learned to love these days 
 I'll learned to love these days 
 I could wait the hundred years 
 You gave me here the days when you near 
 The days when I was out there 
 Lookin' for what comes next 
 Oh, cause every minute, every hour, everyday 
 Is such a gift and I can say 
 I'm thankful for each day 
 So I'll learn to love these days 
 Life along the way 
 In the middle of the crazy 
 God, your love is so amazing 
 Through the ups and downs 
 You're the only hope I've found 
 The Lord you meet me in the madness 
 So I'll learned to love these days 
 I'll learned to love these days 
 I'll learned to love these days 
 I'll learned to love these days

Do you think that a California girl is supposed to have curls and wear a jean size 3? 
 All the curves in all the right places, spray tanned faces just like on TV? 
 And we read in the gospel of Vogue that we're all suppose to dress and move and be 
 Visions of perfection 
 Such a misconception 
 'Cause the real connection is deeper than the eye can see 
 What's inside of you 
 What's inside of me 
 The hands that made the moon and stars 
 The mountains and the seas 
 Made you wonderful, beautiful, marvelously 
 Let the whole world see your 
 True beauty 
 Don't know much about Dolce & Gabbana 
 Seems like a lot of drama to me 
 And you can keep all your red high heels 
 And open-toed shoes - I'm good in my bare feet 
 Let's gown to the nitty gritty 
 Enough sex and the city 
 What about purity? 
 Skin is just the surface 
 The passion and the purpose that's burning down inside us 
 Is really what we need to see 
 Doesn't come in a bottle, doesn't come in a box 
 You can't spray it on, you can't wash it off 
 You can't nip and tuck, you can't sew it up 
 So don't waste your time 
 It's the love in your heart, the peace in your soul 
 The hope in your smile lets the whole world know 
 This little light - you gotta let it shine

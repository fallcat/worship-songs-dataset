Not scared to say it, I used to be the one 
 Preaching it to you, that you could overcome 
 I still believe it, but it ain't easy 
 'Cause that world I painted, where things just all work out 
 It started changing and I started having doubts 
 And it got me so down 
 But I picked myself back up 
 And I started telling me 
 No, my God's not done 
 Making me a masterpiece 
 He's still working on me 
 He started something good and I'm gonna believe it 
 He started something good and He's gonna complete it 
 So I'll celebrate the truth 
 His work in me ain't through 
 I'm just unfinished 
 I'm just unfinished 
 So I'll celebrate the truth 
 His work in me ain't through 
 I'm just unfinished 
 I know His history and the kind of God He is 
 He might make it a mystery 
 But He's proving I can trust in Him 
 And yeah, I believe it 
 So I can pick myself back up 
 And keep on telling me 
 No, my God's not done 
 Making me a masterpiece 
 No, my God's not done 
 He started something good and I'm gonna believe it 
 He started something good and He's gonna complete it 
 So I'll celebrate the truth 
 His work in me ain't through 
 I'm just unfinished 
 (Yeah) 
 I'm just unfinished 
 So I'll celebrate the truth 
 His work in me ain't through 
 Still workin' 
 Still, still workin' on me 
 He's still workin' 
 Still, still workin' on me 
 He started something good and I'm gonna believe it 
 He started something good and He's gonna complete it 
 So I'll celebrate the truth 
 His work in me ain't through 
 I'm just unfinished 
 I'm just unfinished 
 (I'm just unfinished) 
 So I'll celebrate the truth 
 His work in me ain't through 
 I'm just unfinished 
 Still workin' 
 Still, still workin' on me 
 He's still workin' 
 Still, still workin' on me 
 Oh, yeah 
 I'm just unfinished

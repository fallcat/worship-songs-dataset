Most holy Lord 
 You have my attention 
 You know my thoughts 
 And all my intentions 
 I want to honor You in every way 
 I pour my love on You 
 My whole life belongs to You 
 I worship You completely unashamed 
 I give You my heart unrestrained 
 Almighty God 
 You have my devotion 
 With all my mind and all my emotion 
 I want to, God, I want to know You more 
 I pour my love like oil from this broken heart 
 I give myself away unrestrained 
 I let myself go 
 You have set me free 
 I surrender my soul 
 I bow my heart in worship 
 Completely unashamed 
 I give You my heart unrestrained

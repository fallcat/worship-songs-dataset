If You could send a burning bush to Moses 
 Lead Your people home through a parted sea 
 Give a boy the strength to defeat Goliath 
 I know You will always take care of me 
 With You on my side, I am victorious 
 With You on my side, I've got nothing to fear 
 So I can walk through this valley with confidence 
 Knowing You will deliver me 
 If You could raise the dead bones of Lazarus 
 If You could feed five-thousand with a couple fish and a loaf of bread 
 And in the middle of a stormy night You can walk on water 
 I know, I know, I know nothing's out of Your hands 
 If You could pull me out of my sin 
 And give me new life within 
 And keep all Your promises 
 And Your Word is true then 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 I know this is the day You made 
 So no matter what comes my way

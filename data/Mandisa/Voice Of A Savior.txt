Some people try to listen to the bottom of a bottle 
 Some people try to listen to a needle in their arm 
 Some people try to listen to the money in their pocket 
 Some people try to listen to another's arms 
 You and I are not that different 
 We got a void and we're just trying to fill it up 
 With something that will give just a little peace 
 All we want is a hand to reach to 
 Open arms that say I love you 
 We'd give anything to hear 
 The voice of a Savior 
 Some people try to find it with blind ambition 
 Some people try to find it where no one else has gone 
 Some people try to find it in the crowns of victory 
 Some people get defeated and lose the strength to carry on 
 Some people try to find it in the shadow of a steeple 
 Some people try to find it in the back row pew 
 Some people try to find it in the arms of Jesus 
 That's where I found it, how about you?

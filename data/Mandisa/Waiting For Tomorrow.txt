Maybe tomorrow we'll start over 
 Maybe tomorrow I will finally change my ways 
 Said the same things yesterday 
 Don't know why I'm so afraid 
 To let you in 
 To let you win 
 To let you have all of me 
 Can't spend my whole life wastin' 
 Everything I know I've been given 
 'Cause you've made for so much more than 
 Sittin' on the side lines 
 I don't wanna look back and wonder 
 If good enough could've been better 
 Everyday's a day to start over 
 So, why am I waiting for tomorrow 
 Maybe today I'll start believing 
 That you're mercy is really 
 As real as you say it is 
 It doesn't matter who I used to be 
 It only matters that I've been set free 
 You rescued me you're changing me 
 Jesus take everything 
 Can't spend my whole life wastin' 
 Everything I know I've been given 
 'Cause you've made for so much more than 
 Sittin' on the side lines 
 I don't wanna look back and wonder 
 If good enough could've been better 
 Everyday's a day to start over 
 So, why am I waiting for tomorrow 
 Oh, I'm makin' this my moment now 
 To grab the hand that's reachin' down to save me You saved me 
 And I'm makin' this my moment now 
 To grab the hand that's reachin' down to save me You saved me 
 Can't spend my whole life wastin' 
 Everything I know I've been given 
 'Cause you've made for so much more than 
 Sittin' on the side lines 
 I don't wanna look back and wonder 
 If good enough could've been better 
 Everyday's a day to start over 
 So, why am I waiting for tomorrow 
 I'm gonna grab the hand that's reachin' down 
 And I'm not gonna wait until tomorrow 
 Oh, tomorrow

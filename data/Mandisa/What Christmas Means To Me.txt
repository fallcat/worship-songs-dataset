Candles burning low, lots of mistletoe 
 Lots of snow and ice everywhere we go 
 Choirs singing carols right outside my door 
 All these things and more 
 (All these things and more) 
 Now that's what Christmas means to me, my love 
 (That's what Christmas means to me, my love) 
 I see your smiling face like I never seen before 
 Even though I love you madly, it seems I love you more 
 The little cards you give me will touch my heart for sure 
 All these things and more, my darling 
 (All these things and more) 
 Oh, that's what Christmas means to me, my love 
 (That's what Christmas means to me, my love) 
 I feel like running wild 
 (Running wild) 
 As anxious as a little child 
 To push you 'neath the mistletoe 
 I kiss you once and then some more 
 Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby 
 (Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby) 
 And such happiness in the coming year 
 Let's deck the halls with holly, sing sweet 'Silent Night' 
 Fill a tree with the angel hair and pretty, pretty lights 
 Go to sleep and wake up just before daylight 
 All these things and more, baby 
 (All these things and more, baby) 
 That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
 (That's what Christmas means to me, my love) 
 That's what Christmas means to me, my love 
 (That's what Christmas means to me, my love) 
 Christmas, Christmas means to me 
 That's what it means, that's what it means 
 (That's what Christmas means to me, my love) 
 Deck the halls with balls of holly 
 'Tis the season to be jolly 
 That's what, that's what Christmas 
 (That's what Christmas means to me, my love) 
 That's what Christmas means to me 
 (That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

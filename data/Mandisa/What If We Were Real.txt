Well, I'm tired of saying everything 
 I feel like I'm supposed to say 
 I'm tired of smiling all the time 
 I wanna throw the mask away 
 Sometimes you just have a bad day 
 Sometimes you just wanna scream 
 Tell me I'm not the only one 
 Tell me that you feel just like me 
 We keep tryin' to make it look so nice 
 And we keep hidin' what's goin' on inside 
 But what if I share my brokenness 
 What if you share how you feel 
 And what if we weren't afraid of this crazy mess 
 What if we were real 
 What if we were real 
 I'm over hidin my tears 
 I think I'm gonna let em' go 
 I'm over actin' so strong 
 When I ain't even in control 
 We make it so complicated 
 But why does it have to be 
 Why can't we open our hearts and let everybody see 
 We keep tryin' to make it look so nice 
 And we keep hidin' what's goin' on inside 
 But what if I share my brokenness 
 What if you share how you feel 
 And what if we weren't afraid of this crazy mess 
 What if we were real 
 We'd think a little less of ourselves 
 We'd care about someone else 
 'Cause we'd know just how they feel 
 Maybe we could let someone love us 
 Maybe we'd a little more like Jesus 
 Why can't we learn to real 
 Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (yeah, yeah) 
 We keep tryin' to make it look so nice 
 And we keep hidin' what's goin' on inside 
 But what if I share my brokenness 
 What if you share how you feel 
 And what if we weren't afraid of this crazy mess 
 What if we were real 
 You've got to be real 
 You've got to be real 
 You've got to be real 
 You've got to 
 You've got to

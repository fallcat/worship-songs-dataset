These scars aren’t pretty 
 But they’re a part of me 
 And will not ever fade away 
 These marks tell a story 
 Of me down in the valley 
 And how You reached in with Your grace 
 And healed me 
 They remind me of Your faithfulness 
 And all You brought me through 
 They teach me that my brokenness 
 Is something You can use 
 They show me where I’ve been and 
 That I’m not there any more 
 That’s what scars, that’s what scars are for 
 what scars are for 
 Erase, rewind 
 Wish I could every time 
 The hurt, the pain cuts so deep 
 But when I’m weak You’re strong 
 And in Your power I can carry on 
 And my scars say that You won’t ever leave 
 They remind me of Your faithfulness 
 And all You brought me through 
 They teach me that my brokenness 
 Is something You can use 
 They show me where I’ve been and 
 That I’m not there any more 
 That’s what scars, that’s what scars are for 
 I see it on the cross 
 The nails You took for me 
 Scars can change the world 
 Scars can set me free 
 They remind me of Your faithfulness 
 And all You brought me through 
 They teach me that my brokenness 
 Is something You can use 
 They show me where I’ve been and 
 That I’m not there any more 
 That’s what scars, that’s what scars 
 You show me that’s what scars are for 
 What scars are for, yeah 
 What scars are for 
 What scars are for

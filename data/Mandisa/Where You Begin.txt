Today I need You 
 Just to get through 
 Today I'm breaking under the weight of it all 
 And I'm afraid I might fall 
 Today I'm empty 
 But I am willing 
 To keep listening and looking for You in the noise 
 For Your quiet voice 
 Are You telling me to go? 
 Are You telling me to stay? 
 Are You telling me to hold on to You for another day? 
 'Cause I got nothing left 
 And I'm hanging by a thread 
 I give You all my weakness, You give me Your strength 
 'Cause I'm here again, here at my end 
 Where You begin 
 I've seen broken 
 Turn into beauty 
 I've seen redemption 
 Come in and save the day 
 So I don't have to be afraid, no 
 When You're telling me to go 
 When You're telling me to stay 
 When You're telling me to hold on to You for another day 
 When I got nothing left 
 When I'm hanging by a thread 
 I give You all my weakness, You give me Your strength 
 Yeah, I'm here again, here at my end 
 Where You begin 
 Jesus, You make all things new 
 So I will trust in You 
 Are You telling me to go? 
 Are You telling me to stay? 
 Are You telling me to hold on to You for another day? 
 'Cause I got nothing left 
 And I'm hanging by a thread 
 I give You all my weakness, You give me Your strength 
 'Cause I'm here again, here at my end 
 Where You begin 
 Where You begin

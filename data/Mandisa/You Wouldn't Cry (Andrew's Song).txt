All you saw was pain 
 All you saw was rain 
 But you should see me now 
 Moments filled with tears 
 Lasted all those years 
 Disappeared somehow 
 You never said goodbye 
 On your knees you cry 
 You're still asking why, but 
 Blue has never been bluer 
 True has never been truer 
 Honey never tasted so sweet 
 There's a song in the breeze 
 A million voices in praise 
 A rose has never smelled redder 
 The sun has never been brighter 
 If I could find the right words to say 
 If you could look at my face 
 If you could just see this place 
 You wouldn't cry for me today 
 What you think you see 
 Isn't really me 
 I'm already home 
 You've got to lay it down 
 'Cause Jesus holds me now 
 And I am not alone 
 Your faith is wearing thin 
 But I am watching Him 
 And He's holding you too, and 
 What may seem like years will just be a moment 
 Oh, the day will come when I'll show you where you're going 
 I can't wait to show you that

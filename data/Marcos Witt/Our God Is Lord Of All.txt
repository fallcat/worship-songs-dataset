Our God is Lord of all 
 We were created to worship our God 
 We were created to fall in love 
 And now we sing 
 Before the Great I Am 
 Come on and lift your voice 
 As loud as you can 
 Our God is Lord of all 
 Lord of all wonder 
 Lord of all beauty 
 Lord of eternity... Lord of all 
 Who could search out 
 The greatness of God 
 Yet we awe in the depth of His love 
 And now we're dancing 
 For the Great I Am 
 Come on and lift your voice 
 As loud as you can

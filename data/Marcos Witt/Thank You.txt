Thank you 
 Lord, you took me into your arms 
 And you've shown me truest love 
 You have given me such mercy 
 I'm unworthy of 
 Lord, your mercy everlasting 
 I could never understand 
 But for all the love and grace you've shown 
 I just want to say 
 Thank you, thank you my lord 
 Thank you from the bottom of my heart 
 Lord, I thank you, than you dear lord 
 Thank you from the bottom of my heart 
 At the cross you gave your life for me 
 As a gift of your great love 
 It was the gift of everlasting life 
 From above 
 I can boldly come before your throne 
 Through your blood I've been set free 
 I'm going to shout it to the heavens 
 I've been redeemed!

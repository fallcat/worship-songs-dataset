I'm sure he must have been surprised 
 At where this road had taken him 
 Cause never in a million lives 
 Would he have dreamed of Bethlehem 
 And standing at the manger 
 He saw with his own eyes 
 The message from the angel 
 Come to life, and Joseph said 
 Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade 
 Why Him, with all the rulers of the world 
 Why here, inside this stable filled with hay 
 Why her, she's just an ordinary girl 
 Now I'm not one to second guess 
 What angels have to say 
 But, this is such a strange way to save the world 
 To think of how it could have been 
 If Jesus had come as He deserved 
 There would have been no Bethlehem 
 No lowly shepherds at His birth 
 But, Joseph knew the reason 
 Love had to reach so far 
 And as he held the Savior in his arms 
 He must have thought 
 Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade 
 Why Him, with all the rulers of the world 
 Why here, inside this stable filled with hay 
 Why her, she's just an ordinary girl 
 Now I'm not one to second guess 
 What angels have to say 
 But, this is such a strange way to save the world 
 (Now I'm not one) 
 Now I'm not one to second guess 
 What angels have to say 
 But, this is such a strange way 
 (Strange way) 
 A Strange way (strange way) 
 This is such a strange way 
 (Strange way) 
 To save the world 
 This is such a strange way 
 This is such a strange way 
 I don't claim to really know 
 Why You gave this King 
 But I really thank You, thank You 
 (Thank You for Your Song) 
 Thank You, thank You 
 (On this Christmas day) 
 Thank You, thank You 
 (We praise and glorify Your name on this day)

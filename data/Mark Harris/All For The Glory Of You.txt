A thunderstorm shouts in the dead of the night 
 Tells of Your power, it tells of Your might, it's true 
 All for the glory of You 
 Golden light shining as each day begun 
 Reminding us all of the kingdom to come so soon 
 All for the glory of You 
 Like the worship all creation gives 
 Let this life I live be 
 All for the glory of You 
 All for the glory of You 
 Every moment all I say and do 
 All for the glory of You 
 The rhythm and rage and the roar of the sea 
 Speak of Your mystery and Your majesty deep blue 
 All for the glory of You 
 Then thousand diamonds hung in the night sky 
 A whisper of holiness hidden on high comes through 
 All for the glory of You 
 Like the worship all creation gives 
 Let this life I live be

Little baby in a manger low 
 Born out in a stable for there was no place to go 
 To the wisemen and the shepherds 
 He's no stranger He's a king 
 And as they kneel before Him 
 They slowly began to sing 
 They're singing 
 Joy to the world 
 The Lord has come 
 Hark the harald angel sing 
 Silent night oh holy night 
 This is the song the wisemen sing 
 Snow is falling and I hear the sound 
 Of the crackle in the fireplace 
 As the embers burning out 
 Stockings are hanging on the mantle 
 Tinsel on the christmas tree 
 And out upon the front porch you can hear 
 The carolers sing 
 They're singing 
 Joy to the world 
 The Lord has come 
 Hark the harald angels sing 
 Silent night oh holy night 
 This is the song the carolers sing 
 Joy to the world 
 The Lord has come 
 Hark the herald angels sing 
 Silent night oh holy night 
 This is the song the carolers sing 
 This is the song the caorlers sing 
 This is the song the carolers sing

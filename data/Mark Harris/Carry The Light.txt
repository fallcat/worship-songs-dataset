Anyone who calls to You, anyone at all 
 With arms wide open 
 Anyone who reaches out, anytime at all 
 With a heart that's broken 
 You will be their shelter 
 You will have an answer 
 For anyone who ever cries out in need 
 I believe there You will be 
 I stand on Your promise 
 Your love is forever 
 And I believe with all my heart 
 You are my one and only Savior 
 You are the calm when my world falls apart 
 And to the ends of the earth 
 And for the rest of my life 
 I'll carry the light 
 Any time I turn to You, any time at all 
 I find You waiting 
 Waiting for the chance to help me, hold me, heal me 
 Show me just how amazing life can be 
 When you know what it is to be free 
 To be free 
 I stand on Your promise 
 Your love is forever 
 And I believe with all my heart 
 You are my one and only Savior 
 You are the calm when my world falls apart 
 And to the ends of the earth 
 And for the rest of my life 
 I'll carry the light 
 Over the mountains 
 Into the valleys 
 Crossing the ocean 
 And through the darkness 
 To all the hopeless 
 For all the broken 
 I'll carry the light 
 I stand on Your promise 
 Your love is forever 
 And I believe with all my heart 
 You are my one and only Savior 
 You are the calm when my world falls apart 
 I stand on Your promise 
 Your love is forever 
 And I believe with all my heart 
 You are my one and only Savior 
 You are the calm when my world falls apart 
 And to the ends of the earth 
 And for the rest of my life 
 I'll carry the light

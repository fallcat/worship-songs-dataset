Fireside, winter snow 
 Lights are on the tree 
 The world is all aglow again 
 With all the season brings 
 And though it comes around each year 
 The meaning of the season sometimes 
 Disappears 
 Oh, it's good to be reminded 
 Christmas is for girls and boys 
 Trimming trees and Santa's toys 
 It's Mom and Dad 
 Gram and Grandpa too 
 Christmas is a sacred birth 
 A chance for hope and peace on earth 
 It's everything that we hold 
 Dear and true 
 'Cause most of all, Christmas is the love 
 That lives inside of me and you 
 Sleepy eyes are open wide 
 And tiny hearts beat fast 
 To celebrate the morning just like 
 Every Christmas past 
 We gather close the family 
 Embracing all that's been 
 And all that's yet to be 
 Oh, it's good to reminded 
 Christmas is the candle light 
 Jingle bells and silent night 
 Friends from long ago 
 And friends we've made anew 
 Christmas is a sacred birth 
 A chance for hope and peace on earth 
 It's everything that we hold 
 Dear and true 
 'Cause most of all, Christmas is the love 
 That lives inside of me and you 
 From where it all began 
 One night in Bethlehem 
 It reaches out to all of us 
 Reminds us once again 
 Christmas is for everyone 
 The greatest gift, the Father's love 
 Christmas is the sacred birth 
 A chance for hope and peace on earth 
 It's everything that we hold 
 Dear and true 
 'Cause most of all Christmas is the love 
 That lives inside of me and you 
 'Cause most of all Christmas is the love 
 That lives inside of me and you

It's only for a moment you are mine to hold 
 The plans that heaven has for you 
 Will all too soon unfold 
 So many different prayers I'll pray 
 For all that you might do 
 But most of all I'll want to know 
 You're walking in the truth 
 And If I never told you 
 I want you to know 
 As I watch you grow 
 I pray that God would fill your heart with dreams 
 And that faith gives you the courage 
 To dare to do great things 
 I'm here for you whatever this life brings 
 So let my love give you roots 
 And help you find your wings 
 May passion be the wind 
 That leads you through your days 
 And may conviction keep you strong 
 Guide you on your way 
 May there be many moments 
 That make your life so sweet 
 Oh, but more than memories 
 It's not living if you don't reach for the sky 
 I'll have tears as you take off 
 But I'll cheer as you fly

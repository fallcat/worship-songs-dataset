I was waiting for a push, waiting for a sign 
 Waiting for the perfect moment to arrive 
 Steady as a clock, caught between the line 
 Living for myself until I realized 
 There's too much life You've given me 
 To let it slip away 
 I'm ready to live, ready to breathe 
 Ready to take in everything 
 I'm ready to love, ready to shine 
 Ready to live this life of mine 
 I'm ready to jump, ready to fly for the first time 
 I want to take a dive, I want to take a chance 
 I want to make the most of every day I have 
 I want to be alive, I want to be a man 
 'Cause being wild at heart is really who I am 
 You've put these dreams inside of me 
 So what can hold them back 
 I can feel it 
 Being pushed by Bigger Hands 
 You have saved me 
 You have made me who I am

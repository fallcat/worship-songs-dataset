Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Let your heart be light 
 From now on 
 Our troubles will be out of sight 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Make the Yuletide gay 
 From now on 
 Our troubles will be miles away, yeah 
 Here we are as in olden days 
 Happy golden days of yore 
 Faithful friends who are dear to us 
 Gather near to us once more 
 Merry Christmas 
 Through the years we all will be together 
 If the Lord allows 
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough 
 And have yourself a merry little Christmas now 
 Here we are as in olden days 
 Happy golden days of yore 
 Faithful friends who are dear to us 
 Gather near to us once more 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas now 
 Light the fire, trim the tree 
 Come and spend a little time 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas

In a moment or two when so much time has passed 
 And I'd try to recall where it all went so fast 
 I will look back on the life when it's easy to do 
 So much will be clear in a moment or two 
 In a moment or two, I will sift through the days 
 And I'll measure successes and mourn some mistakes 
 So let me wake every dawn to the light of this truth 
 That a lifetime is lived in a moment or two 
 Yeah, a lifetime is lived in a moment 
 I will see Jesus, I will see Jesus 
 All I've lived for, all I've loved for 
 Finally where I belong 
 I will see Jesus when I get home

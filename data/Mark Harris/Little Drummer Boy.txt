Come they told me, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 A new born King to see, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 To lay before the King, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 Rum pa, pum, pum, rum pa, pum, pum 
 So to honor Him, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 When we come 
 I will play for You, I will play for You 
 On my drum, on my drum 
 Rum pa, pum, pum 
 Little Baby, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 I am a poor boy too, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 I have no gift to bring, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 That's fit to give the King, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 Rum pa, pum, pum, rum pa, pum, pum 
 Shall I play for You, pa rum, pa pum pum 
 On my drum? 
 I will play for You, I will play for You 
 On my drum, on my drum 
 On my drum, on my drum 
 Rum pa, pum, pum 
 Mary nodded, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 I played my drum for Him, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 I played my best for Him, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 Rum pa, pum, pum, rum pa, pum, pum 
 Then He smiled at me, pa rum, pa pum, pum 
 Me and my drum 
 I will play for You, I will play for You 
 I will play for You, I will play for You 
 On my drum, on my drum 
 On my drum, on my drum 
 Rum pa, pum, pum, rum pa, pum, pum 
 Rum pa, pum, pum, rum pa, pum, pum

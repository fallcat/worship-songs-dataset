Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining 
 It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth 
 A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn 
 Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh, night divine 
 Truly He taught us to love one another 
 His law is love and His gospel is peace 
 Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother 
 And in His name all oppression shall cease 
 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we 
 With all our hearts we praise His holy name 
 Christ is the Lord, oh, praise His name forever 
 His power and glory ever more proclaim 
 His power and glory ever more proclaim 
 Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night when Christ was born 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh, night divine 
 Oh, night divine, oh, night, oh, night divine

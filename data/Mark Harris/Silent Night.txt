Silent night, holy night 
 All is calm, all is bright 
 Round yon Virgin Mother and Child 
 Holy Infant so tender and mild 
 Sleep in heavenly peace 
 Sleep in heavenly peace 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Shepherds quake at the sight 
 Glories stream from heaven afar 
 Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Christ, the Savior is born 
 Christ, the Savior is born 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Son of God, love's pure light 
 Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth 
 Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Silent night, holy night 
 It was a silent night 
 It was a holy night 
 It was a silent night 
 It was a holy night 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It was a silent night 
 It was a holy, holy night 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Silent night, holy night

It's quiet 
 I'm listening 
 I need to hear you speak 
 I'm broken 
 I'm desperate 
 Here waiting on my knees 
 The whole world around can shake 
 But I will not leave this place 
 Until you speak to me 
 I'm desperate for you Lord 
 Speak to me 
 My heart cries out for me 
 Here and now 
 On my knees 
 I will stay, I will not leave 
 Until you speak to me 
 My heart beats 
 I long for 
 All that your presence brings 
 Your greatness 
 Your mercy 
 Is life and breath to me 
 One word can calm the seas 
 And bring sweet peace to me

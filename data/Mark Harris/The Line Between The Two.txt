A beginning and an ending, dates upon a stone 
 But the moment in the middle is how we will be known 
 'Cause what defines us can be found within a line 
 Finding reason for our time 
 And the years go by, how they seem to fly 
 They'll all be over soon 
 When our life is done, did we live and love 
 The way we wanted to 
 Cause everyday that we leave behind 
 Goes on to tell the truth 
 Of how we lived in the line between the two 
 The line between the two 
 Will I walk straight, will I be true 
 Will I finish strong 
 Will I stand up for the moment 
 When I could right a wrong 
 Because the legacy we have will never change 
 It's how we spend our days 
 I could live a life for just myself 
 Or I could live a life for someone else 
 But I'll live and die just to hear 
 You say 
 Well done my son come and be with Me

Is it unfair to say that You are leading, 
 Then try and face this mountain on my own, 
 Why am I scared, I've never stopped believing, 
 And You never left me alone. 
 Well, I can get ahead of where you've led me to, 
 But I will trust Your heart enough to wait for You ... 
 Until this mountain moves, 
 Until the path is clear, 
 Until Your voice is the only one I can hear. 
 Until I see Your hand, 
 Until I know Your heart, 
 Until I trust the grace that's carried me this far 
 I will be still, until ... 
 How could I have never seen this coming, 
 It's not like I've been running from Your will, 
 Tell me why each day's another mystery, 
 Waiting for Your truth to be revealed, 
 I try to tell my heart to trust what I believe, 
 And wait on You through all of my uncertainty ... 
 Until this mountain moves, 
 Until the path is clear, 
 Until Your voice is the only one I can hear. 
 Until I see Your hand, 
 Until I know Your heart, 
 Until I trust the grace that's carried me this far 
 I will be still, until ... 
 Be still my heart of worry, 
 Be still my restless soul, 
 Be confident and certain, 
 Be still and know 
 Until this mountain moves, 
 Until the path is clear, 
 Until Your voice is the only one I can hear. 
 Until I see Your hand, 
 Until I know Your heart, 
 Until I trust the grace that's carried me this far 
 I will be still, until ... 
 Oh, I will be still, until

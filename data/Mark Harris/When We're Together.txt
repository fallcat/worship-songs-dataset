I'd like to sail to lands afar 
 Out on a boat that's built for two 
 Beneath a canopy of stars 
 That would be just like a dream come true 
 Just to be with you 
 And oh, oh, oh, oh 
 When we're together 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Feels like forever 
 Worries seem to fade away 
 As they become as distant memories 
 When we're together 
 I'd like a castle on a hill 
 Where you and I could spend the day 
 And I'd love to go where time stands still 
 And all that doesn't matter fades away 
 You are here with me 
 And oh, oh, oh, oh 
 When we're together 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Feels like forever 
 Worries seem to fade away 
 As they become as distant memories 
 When we're together 
 And I'd love to 
 Dance with you 
 Under the big blue sky 
 We'd hold the 
 Wonder of the moment 
 As the moment passes by 
 When we're together 
 And oh, oh, oh, oh 
 When we're together 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Feels like forever 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Feels just like forever 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Yeah, whenever we're together 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 When we're together

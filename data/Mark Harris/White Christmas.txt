I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 Where the treetops glisten and children listen 
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow 
 Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
 With every Christmas card I write 
 May your days be merry and bright 
 And may all your Christmases be white 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
 With every Christmas card I write 
 May your days be merry and bright 
 And may all your Christmases 
 All your Christmases 
 May all your Christmases be white

It hurts every time we hear of a friend 
 Who has walked with the Lord and then stumbled in sin 
 As the story unravels there's one shining truth 
 For so long the family had been seeing clues 
 Yeah, we can talk about faith but the truth is known 
 By the ones who see who we are at home 
 Between the windows and walls 
 The floor to the ceiling, in the doorways and halls 
 Always revealing what we really love the most 
 Our hearts are exposed 
 Between our windows and walls 
 Under our roof, day in, day out, that's where there's proof 
 'Cause if Jesus means anything at all 
 There will be evidence between our windows and walls 
 We can pretend like we've got it together 
 Hide our faults, say we couldn't be between 
 Even fool some people some of the time 
 But sooner or later everyone finds 
 There's one place where nothing's disguised 
 In our unguarded moments there will be eyes 
 Between our

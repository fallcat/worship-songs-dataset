I wanted to tell you how closely I've kept 
 The memories of you in my heart 
 And all of the lifetimes that we had to share 
 Live even though we're apart 
 But don't cry for me 
 'Cause I'm finally free 
 To run with the angels 
 On streets made of gold 
 To listen to stories of saints new and old 
 To worship our Maker 
 That's where I'll be 
 When you finally find me 
 No don't you be weary cause waiting for you 
 Are wonders that you've never known 
 Just hold on to Jesus, reach out for his hands 
 And one day They'll welcome you home 
 And that's when you'll be 
 Finally free 
 Finally free 
 I wish you were here, I wish you were here 
 And all of the dreams that you treasure 
 Will soon come together 
 And that's when your sorrow will find tomorrow 
 And you will rise again 
 We'll run with the angels on streets made of gold 
 We'll listen to stories of saints new and old 
 We'll worship our maker that's where we'll be 
 When you finally find me 
 I wish you were here

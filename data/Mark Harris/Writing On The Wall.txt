I came home from work 
 And she was waiting at the door 
 Had that bad day look in her eyes 
 And I heard the sound of her little feet 
 Across the hardwood floor 
 And I knelt down with my arms open wide 
 When I asked her what had happened 
 She pointed to our son and said 
 "Why don't you show your daddy what you've done" 
 And I could see the writing on the wall 
 Evidence of little hands 
 Picasso with a purple crayon 
 And I tried to act upset 
 But I was smiling through it all 
 'Cause I could see the writing on the wall, yeah 
 It was the first day of school 
 Standing by the laundry door 
 Wondering how third grade came so fast 
 I took a ruler and a sharpie pen 
 And I drew the line once more 
 So amazed at how the time had passed 
 With a backpack full of promise 
 And wonder in her eyes 
 I turned my head just so she wouldn't see me cry 
 'Cause I could see the writing on the wall 
 It seems no matter how I tried 
 The pages of this life keep turning 
 It's a roller coaster ride 
 And even though I knew we had it all 
 I could see the writing on the wall 
 I got a cinematic memory 
 Playing pictures of the past 
 Adding to the story as we go 
 'Cause every day I'm learning 
 That tomorrow comes too fast 
 So, I'm holding on to the only way I know 
 Yeah, yeah, whoa 
 I can see the writing on the wall 
 It seems no matter how I tried 
 The pages of this life keep turning 
 I can't stop the hands of time 
 Even though I knew we had it all 
 I can see the writing on the wall 
 Whoa, I can see the writing on the wall

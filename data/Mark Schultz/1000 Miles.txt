Would walk 1,000 miles 
 1,000 miles it's true 
 I would walk 1,000 miles 
 Just to be with You 
 'Cause you've got my heart and you've got my soul 
 You've got this promise too 
 I would walk 1,000 miles 
 Just to be with You 
 If I could live 100 years 
 Before my life is through 
 If I could live 100 years 
 I'd spend them loving You 
 Cause You've got my heart and you've got my soul 
 You've got this promise too 
 If I could live 100 years 
 I'd spend them loving You 
 If I could write 10,000 songs 
 10,000 songs it's true 
 If I Could write 10,000 songs 
 I'd Sing them all for you 
 'Cause you've got my heart and you've got my soul 
 You've got this promise too 
 If I could write 10,000 songs 
 I'd Sing them all for you

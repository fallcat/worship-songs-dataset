Lord, I came to the mountaintop 
 To be with You 
 I felt Your grace falling down like rain 
 And I was made new 
 But there are times like now when I'm all dried out 
 And it's like 40 days out in the desert 
 Feeling like I'm lost forever 
 And crying out for You 
 But in these 40 days I'm going to seek You 
 With my heart because I believe You 
 Have brought me to this place 
 These 40 days 
 Lord, Your ways are not my own 
 But I trust You 
 Lord, You say, "You are not alone, 
 For I am with you" 
 But there are times like now when You can't be found 
 'Cause You are with me 
 You never leave me 
 Even when my world turns upside down 
 'Cause there are times like now when I will 
 Trust somehow

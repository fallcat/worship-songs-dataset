Well, I know what it means to be shackled by my worst mistakes 
 And I know what it means to be set free 
 'Cause I fell at the cross as broken as I've ever been 
 It was there that I heard my Saviour sing 
 Child of mine lift your eyes 
 All has been forgiven, every sin is lifted 
 Let your chains fall away 
 All has been forgotten, buried at the bottom of the sea 
 You are free and all has been forgiven 
 Now the weight of the world is finally lifting off my shoulders 
 And I feel like I can breathe 
 Every hope, every dream, everything I've buried deep inside me arise 
 Can you hear the heavens sing? 
 All has been forgiven, every sin is lifted 
 Let your chains fall away 
 All has been forgotten, buried at the bottom of the sea 
 You are free and all has been forgiven 
 And all your guilt and all your shame 
 Let it go in Jesus' name 
 Lay it all down at His feet 
 By His grace in His mercy 
 All has been forgiven, every sin is lifted 
 Let your chains fall away 
 All has been forgotten, buried at the bottom of the sea 
 You are free and all has been forgiven, all has been forgiven

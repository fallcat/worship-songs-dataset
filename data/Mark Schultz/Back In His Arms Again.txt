I see it in your eyes 
 The pain you keep inside 
 It's slowly tearing you apart 
 Though you've run away 
 Reminded day by day 
 You've stumbled and you've fallen 
 Still He's callin' 
 I believe that he loves you where you are 
 I believe that you've seen the hands of God 
 I believe that you'll know it when 
 You're back in His arms again 
 I believe that He never let you go 
 I believe that He's wanting you to know 
 I believe that He'll lead you till 
 You're back in his arms again. 
 Glad I found you here 
 'Cause in between the tears 
 Something in your eyes shows hope 
 And I stand before you now 
 As one that knows about 
 Coming to Him open 
 And broken 
 I believe that he loves you where you are 
 I believe that you've seen the hands of God 
 I believe that you'll know it when 
 You're back in His arms again 
 I believe that He never let you go 
 I believe that He's wanting you to know 
 I believe that He'll lead you till 
 You're back in his arms again. 
 And I know that He's calling 
 He's calling you Home 
 I believe that he loves you where you are 
 I believe that you've seen the hands of God 
 I believe that you'll know it when 
 You're back in His arms again 
 I believe that He never let you go 
 I believe that He's wanting you to know 
 I believe that He'll lead you till 
 You're back in his arms again. 
 One Life, one love, one way, Home 
 And when you rise and when you fall 
 He will see you through it all 
 He is waiting you are called, back in His arms again

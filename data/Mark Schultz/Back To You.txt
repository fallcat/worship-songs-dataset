Words and Music by Mark Schultz 
 From the recording: Song Cinema, Track #7. 
 Sitting here on the dock as the sun is setting 
 Red and gold in a purple sky 
 And the breeze through the trees keeps them gently rocking 
 Just like the waves that are keeping time 
 And I know You are all around me 
 I'm so glad You came and found me 
 Out here tonight I'm caught so up in wonder 
 So many things that I've wanted to say 
 Thank You for life and for love and for laughter 
 Thanks for this heart that is finding its way 
 Back to You 
 All around, hear the sound of creation singing 
 Lift their praise up to God on high 
 I know You're there, know You care, I know You made the moment 
 I take a breath and I close my eyes 
 And I know You are all around me 
 I know that I gotta get on...

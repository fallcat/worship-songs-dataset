There's a businessman 
 There's a widowed wife 
 There's a smiling face with 
 A shattered life 
 There's a teenage girl with a choice to make 
 It's crowded here in church today 
 And the preacher says as the sermon ends 
 Please close your eyes and bow your heads 
 Is there anyone in need of prayer 
 Jesus wants to meet you here 
 'Cause we all fall short 
 We all have sinned 
 But when you let 
 God's Grace break in... 
 It's beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Come as you are 
 Surrender your heart 
 Broken and beautiful 
 Well he'd never been to church before 
 But he came today as a last resort 
 His world was crashing in 
 And he was suffocating in his sin 
 But tears ran down 
 As hope rushed in 
 He closed his eyes 
 Raised his hands 
 Worshiping the God who can 
 Bring him back to life again 
 It's beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Come as you are 
 Surrender your heart 
 Broken and beautiful 
 Cause there's nothing more beautiful to God 
 Than when his sons and daughters come 
 Broken 
 Alleluia 
 Alleluia 
 Come as you are 
 Alleluia 
 Alleluia 
 Come as you are 
 It's beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Come as you are 
 Surrender your heart 
 Broken and beautiful 
 Alleluia 
 Alleluia 
 Come as you are 
 (Come as you are) 
 Surrender your heart 
 Broken and beautiful 
 Alleluia 
 Alleluia 
 Come as you are 
 (Come as you are) 
 Surrender your heart 
 Broken and beautiful

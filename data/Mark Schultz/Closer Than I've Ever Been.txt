I've fallen farther than I have ever been 
 Lord, I long for Your embrace 
 Can You take me in? Take me back again 
 To that place where I am whole in You 
 Yeah, let me fall down at Your feet 
 Feel Your presence all around me 
 Don't let go until I am closer 
 Closer than I've ever been 
 Until I find myself in all Your glory 
 Until I'm weak enough to seek Your strength 
 Until I know that I am held by mercy 
 Until I am closer, closer than I've ever been 
 So break this heart of mine if it means 
 That I'm letting go by holding on to You 
 Yeah, let me fall down at Your feet 
 Feel Your presence all around me 
 Don't let go until I am closer 
 Closer than I've ever been 
 Until I find myself in all Your glory 
 Until I'm weak enough to seek Your strength 
 Until I know that I am held by mercy 
 Until I am closer, closer than I've ever been 
 In all Your glory, in all Your grace 
 Lord, hold me closer 
 Until I find myself in all Your glory 
 Until I'm weak enough to seek Your strength 
 Until I know that I am held by mercy 
 Until I am closer, closer than I've ever been 
 Closer than I've ever been, closer than I've ever been 
 Hold me closer, closer

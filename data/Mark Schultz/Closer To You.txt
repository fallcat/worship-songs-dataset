Closer to me I'm tired and I'm weak 
 And every breath within me is longing just to be 
 Closer to You 
 So I face the road ahead 
 'Cause I know there's no comparing 
 To what's waiting at the end 
 So let the rain start falling where it will 
 And I will run through this valley 
 Just to climb to that hill 
 And if they ask why I'm smiling 
 After all I've been through 
 It's 'cause I'm just a day closer to You 
 Closer to me I hear You whisper on the wind 
 You say although my life is ending 
 A new one will begin 
 Closer to You 
 And I know I'm not alone 
 'Cause I can hear You in the distance 
 Saying, you are nearly home 
 So let the rain start falling where it will 
 And I will run through this valley 
 Just to climb to that hill 
 And if they ask why I'm dancing 
 Though my days may be few 
 It's 'cause I'm just a day closer to You 
 Closer to me You're in the laughter and the tears 
 Of the ones I leave behind me 
 Who have prayed me through the years 
 Closer to You 
 And I know it won't be long 
 Till You're running down the pathway 
 Just to take me in Your arms 
 So let the rain start falling where it will 
 And I will run through this valley 
 Just to climb to that hill 
 And if they ask why I'm singing 
 Though my life's almost through 
 It's 'cause I'm just a day closer 
 I'm just a day closer 
 I'm just a day closer to You

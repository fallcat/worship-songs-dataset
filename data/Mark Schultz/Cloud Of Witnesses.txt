We watched them running down the aisles 
 Children's time Sunday morning 
 The preacher asked them who they loved 
 They all smiled and started pointing 
 To their mom, their dad, the teacher from their kindergarten class 
 Each and every one 
 Had just become... 
 A cloud of witnesses that would see them through the years 
 Cheer them with a smile and pray them through the tears 
 A cloud of witnesses that would see them to the end 
 And shower them with love that never ends 
 A cloud of witnesses 
 They stuck together through the years 
 The best of friends faith could foster 
 So when they found out one of them 
 Had heard the news he'd lost his father, 
 They ran to him and prayed and put their hands upon his head 
 And slowly one by one 
 They'd all become 
 A cloud of witnesses 
 As they sent above a prayer 
 They took a hold of hands 
 And circled 'round a friend 
 A cloud of witnesses 
 With a faith just like a rock 
 They helped him give his father back to God 
 As a cloud of witnesses 
 So when it comes the time 
 That heaven calls 
 They'll come running 
 To see the ones who've gone before 
 Who ran the race and made the journey home 
 To find waiting for them at the finish line 
 Cheering happily 
 They will run and they will see 
 A cloud of Witnesses 
 Lined up on a street of gold 
 As they run the final mile 
 That leads them to a throne 
 And through the cloud of Witnesses 
 They see God upon that throne 
 As they fall into His arms they know they're home 
 In a cloud of witnesses 
 Surrounded by 
 A cloud of witnesses... 
 Watched them running down the aisles 
 Children's time, Sunday morning

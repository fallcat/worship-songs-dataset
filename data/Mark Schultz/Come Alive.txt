Whatever happen to your child like wonder? 
 Whatever happened to your heartfelt faith? 
 You used to live your life with such a hunger 
 Whatever happened to those days? 
 Your smile use to tell a beautiful story 
 But every life we'll make a few wrong turns 
 And now you hide your heart 
 Afraid that you're too far beyond repair, oh, but I am His 
 So bring your broken heart to me 
 Lift it up and you will see 
 That our love can make a heart that's barely beating 
 Come alive, come alive 
 My love is stronger than your weakest moment 
 My grace is greater than your worst mistake 
 No matter where you've been 
 I'm waiting at the end of every road 
 So bring your broken heart to me 
 Lift it up and you will see 
 That our love can make a heart that's barely beating 
 Come alive, come alive 
 So close your eyes, let me love you 
 I'm by your side 
 So close your eyes, let me love you 
 I'm by your side 
 Bring your broken heart to me 
 Lift it up and you will see 
 That our love can make a heart that's barely beating 
 Come alive, come alive 
 And even when it all goes wrong 
 There's no such thing as too far gone 
 And our love can make a heart that's barely beating 
 Come alive, come alive 
 Close your eyes, let me love you 
 I'm by your side 
 Come alive, come alive 
 Come alive, come alive

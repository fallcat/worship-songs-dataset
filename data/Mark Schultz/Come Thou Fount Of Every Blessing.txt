Come Thou fount of every blessing 
 Tune my heart to sing Thy praise 
 Streams of mercy never ceasing 
 Call for songs of loudest praise 
 Teach me some melodious sonnet 
 Sung by Flaming Tongues above 
 Praise His name, I'm fixed upon it 
 Name of God's redeeming love 
 [Incomprehensible] Thy love has blessed me 
 Thou has brought me to this place 
 And I know Thy hand will bring me 
 Safely home by Thy good grace 
 Jesus saw me when a stranger 
 Wandering from the fold of God 
 He to rescue me from danger 
 Bought me with His precious blood 
 Oh, to grace how great a debtor 
 Daily I'm constrained to be 
 Let Thy goodness like a fetter 
 Bind my wandering heart to Thee 
 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it 
 Prone to leave the God I love 
 Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it 
 Seal it for Thy courts above 
 Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it 
 Seal it for Thy courts above

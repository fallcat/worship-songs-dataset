Snow is falling Christmas Eve 
 Lights are coming on up and down the street 
 The sound of carols fills the air 
 And people rushing home, families everywhere 
 Putting candles in the windows 
 Lights upon the tree 
 But there's no laughter in this house 
 Not like there used to be 
 There's just a million little memories 
 That remind me you're not here 
 It's just a different kind of Christmas this year 
 In the evening fires glow 
 Dancing underneath the mistletoe 
 A letter left from Santa Claus 
 Won't be the same this year in this house because 
 There's one less place set at the table 
 One less gift under the tree 
 And a brand new way to take their place inside of me 
 I'm unwrapping all these memories 
 Fighting back the tears 
 It's just a different kind of Christmas this year 
 And there's voices in the driveway 
 Families right outside the door 
 And we'll try to make this Christmas like the ones we've had before 
 As we gather round the table, I see joy on every face 
 And I realize what's still alive is the legacy you made 
 It's time to put the candles in the windows, the lights upon the tree 
 It's time to fill this house with laughter like it used to be 
 Just because you're up in heaven, doesn't mean you're not near 
 It's just a different kind of Christmas 
 It's just a different kind of Christmas this year

It's cold tonight, 
 I heard her say. 
 She was staring out the window 
 As I came home late. 
 She tried to smile 
 But looked away 
 Oh I could see the tears were running 
 Down her face 
 She said... 
 You go to work, 
 You pay the bills. 
 I stay at home, 
 And I make the meals 
 But you don't even know who I am anymore. 
 You're a million miles away 
 Though I see you every day 
 And I've been waiting right here, 
 Oh for all these years 
 And sometimes I get so lonely, 
 I need to know you love me 
 But do you even know me anymore? 
 I turned around. 
 To see my son. 
 Oh, I remember his first birthday, 
 Now he's twenty-one. 
 I missed his life. 
 I missed it all, 
 Oh, to him I was a man 
 Just living down the hall. 
 He said... I learned to live, 
 Without you Dad 
 But I'd give it all 
 Just to have you back. 
 But you don't even know who I am anymore. 
 I used to wait at all my games 
 But still you never came 
 And I've been waiting right here, 
 Oh for all these years 
 From the time you said you'd owe me, 
 I've wanted you to show me 
 But you don't even know me anymore? 
 I've watched my days, 
 Turn into years 
 And now I'm wondering how I wound up here. 
 I dreamed my dreams 
 I made my plans 
 But all I've built here is an empty man. 
 And I don't even know who I am anymore. 
 Oh, God I'm praying through the tears, 
 Let me make up for these years 
 Oh, have I waited too long? 
 Can I start again, 
 To be the man you've wanted of me 
 I'm begging you to show me 
 But do you even know me anymore?

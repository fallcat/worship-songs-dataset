I must have felt your tears 
 When they took me from your arms 
 I'm sure I must have heard you say goodbye 
 Lonely and afraid had you made a big mistake 
 Could an ocean even hold the tears you cried 
 But you had dreams for me 
 You wanted the best for me 
 And you made the only choice you could that night 
 You gave life to me 
 A brand new world to see 
 Like playing baseball in the yard with dad at night 
 Mom reading Goodnight Moon 
 And praying in my room 
 So if you worry if your choice was right 
 You gave me up but you gave everything to me 
 And if I saw you on the street 
 Would you know that it was me 
 And would your eyes be blue or green like mine 
 Would we share a warm embrace 
 Would you know me in your heart 
 Or would you smile and let me walk on by 
 Knowing you had dreams for me 
 You wanted the best for me 
 And I hope that you'd be proud of who I am 
 You gave life to me 
 A chance to find my dreams 
 And a chance to fall in love 
 You should have seen her shining face 
 On our wedding day 
 Oh is this the dream you had in mind 
 When you gave me up 
 You gave everything to me 
 And when I see you there 
 Watching from heaven's gates 
 Into your arms 
 I'm gonna run 
 And when you look in my eyes 
 You can see my whole life 
 See who I was 
 And who I've become

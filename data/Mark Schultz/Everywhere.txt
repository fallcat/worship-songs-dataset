I was thinking of placing an ad 
 Inside a magazine so I could find You 
 I was picking up book after book 
 Taking a look 
 At trying to define You 
 I was lookin' for proof of Your life 
 Wondering why 
 I couldn't verify You 
 Then You came and You spoke to my heart 
 Now I see 
 Where You are' 
 You're every 
 Time I turn around 
 In every sound 
 You're in the very air I breathe 
 You're up above 
 And now I know 
 You're in my soul 
 You're in the very depths of me 
 And every step I take 
 I take by faith 
 Oh and now I see 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 Yes, I believe 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 That You're everywhere 
 I was checking the best seller list 
 For something I missed 
 To spiritualize me 
 I was following step after step 
 Trying my best 
 To reinvent a new me 
 I was looking for truth in my life 
 I even tried 
 To psychoanalyze me 
 Now I'm seeing right from the start 
 You were there 
 In my heart 
 I believe in the power of the Holy Ghost 
 I believe in the One who has made me whole 
 I believe with my heart 
 I believe with my soul 
 I believe that You laid down Your life for me 
 I believe that You rose up and set me free 
 I believe what I know 
 Oh and I know I believe 
 You're everywhere

Words and Music by Mark Schultz 
 From the recording: Song Cinema, Track #8. 
 A chapter done 
 Turn the page 
 And separate roads 
 Lead separate ways 
 But as we go, we're not alone 
 No, we're not alone 
 Because faith and hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say goodbye 
 Where would we be without the Faith 
 Where would we be without the Hope 
 Where would we be without the Faith 
 The one that God alone has made 
 Because faith and hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say 
 Faith, hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say goodbye 
 Where would we be without the Faith 
 Where would we ve without the Hope 
 Where would we be without the Faith 
 The one that God alone has made 
 Because faith, hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say 
 Faith, hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say goodbye 
 Yea, though I walk 
 Down in the valley of the shadow of darkness 
 I will not fear 
 I will fear no evil 
 Because faith, hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say 
 Faith, hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say goodbye 
 Because faith and hope and love 
 Are waiting for you when we say goodbye 
 Faith and hope and love 
 Waiting for you when 
 We'll be praying until then 
 Waiting for you when we say goodbye

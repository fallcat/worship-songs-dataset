Each night I sit alone 
 I dial you on the phone 
 But you're not there 
 Oh, are you there? 
 Can't keep my heart from breakin' 
 Can't keep my mind from thinkin' 
 You're not here 
 I need you here 
 Just because you feel alone 
 It doesn't mean we're letting go 
 I will be with you till the very end 
 Don't close your eyes 
 Don't say goodbye 
 Don't let the tears fall from your eyes 
 I can't help but think about you night and day 
 When you stumble, 
 When you fall 
 I'll help you make it through it all 
 When I think of you 
 I fall in love again 
 Can't teach my heart to listen 
 Oh, it just keeps on missin' 
 How it was 
 Memories of 
 You right there by my side, oh 
 Never dreamed of letting go 
 And now you're gone 
 It feels so wrong 
 Just because you feel alone 
 It doesn't mean we're letting go 
 I will be with you till the very end... 
 I believe in faith above 
 In givin' everlasting love 
 And I believe there is a chance for us...

Tomorrow she'll be turning 17 
 But somehow now the mirror has become her enemy 
 Feelin' like she'll never measure up 
 Feelin' like she'll never be enough 
 In her Father's Eyes, he is taken by her beauty 
 And captivated by her every time 
 In her Father's eyes, he is longing just to tell her 
 She's never been more lovely in her life 
 If only she could see herself one time 
 In her Father's eyes 
 He's on the edge of giving up tonight 
 He's feelin' like he's wasted the best days of his life 
 Afraid he'll never be the man he thought that he could be 
 When he looks inside he's so ashamed of who he sees 
 But in his Father's eyes he is a son of glory 
 The image of a strong and mighty king 
 In his Father's eyes, there's more left in the story 
 He's fighting hard to hold back tears of pride 
 If only he could see himself tonight 
 In his Father's eyes 
 So no matter where you are 
 And no matter what you've done 
 You're not alone 
 You're not alone 
 And no matter where you've been 
 And no matter where you're from 
 Come back home 
 Come back home 
 ?'Cause in your Father's eyes, you're loved with such abandon 
 He's running to you now arms open wide 
 In your Father's eyes, you're safe and you're accepted 
 There's nothing you can do to change His mind 
 If only you could see yourself one time 
 If only you could see yourself one time 
 In your Father's eyes 
 In your Father's eyes

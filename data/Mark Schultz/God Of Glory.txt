I have felt the beauty of Your holiness 
 But I have lost the passion that I once possessed 
 You're my savior, my redeemer, keeper of my heart forever 
 I come empty, I come lost and broken 
 Open up the heavens, Lord and show Your glory 
 God of glory, open up the heavens now 
 Open up the heavens, Lord and rain down mercy 
 God of mercy, let Your love come raining down 
 I have felt Your spirit washing over me 
 In Your presence I have fallen to my knees 
 Ever faithful, all forgiving, You are love unending 
 Open up the heavens, Lord and show Your glory 
 God of glory, open up the heavens now 
 Open up the heavens, Lord and rain down mercy 
 God of mercy, let Your love come raining down 
 Help this tired and empty soul and let me breathe again 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Open up the heavens, Lord and show Your glory 
 God of glory, open up the heavens now 
 Open up the heavens, Lord and rain down mercy 
 God of mercy, let Your love come raining down 
 God of glory, God of glory 
 God of glory, open up the heavens now 
 God of glory, God of glory 
 God of glory, God of glory 
 God of glory, open up the heavens now 
 God of mercy, let Your love come raining down

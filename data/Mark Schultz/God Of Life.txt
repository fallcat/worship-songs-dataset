God of Life, Lord of all 
 Hear my prayer 
 Hear my call 
 Take this life 
 Take it all 
 Let it burn 
 Let it show 
 Let this life down here on earth 
 Echo in return 
 I believe in You 
 I believe in You 
 God of life 
 I believe in You 
 God of life, 
 Lord of truth 
 Let me live 
 To worship You 
 So all may hear 
 And all may know 
 That You are God 
 The God of hope 
 Let this life down here on earth 
 Echo in return 
 With my heart and with my soul 
 I will worship You alone 
 God of Life, Lord of all 
 Hear my prayer, hear my call 
 Let this life show 
 Let it echo 
 I believe in You

I'm not myself today 
 But I'm finding it's okay 
 My heart is learning to believe 
 You could love someone like me 
 Oh Lord, I'm not myself today 
 'Cause I was lost until You found me 
 Now I feel Your arms around me 
 Open wide the gates tonight 
 Jesus, come and flood my life with grace amazing 
 Now I know in letting go 
 What it means to be set free by grace amazing 
 I've been forever changed 
 I heard You call my name 
 You lavish me with love unearned 
 So much more than I deserve 
 Oh Lord, I've been forever changed 
 'Cause I was blind but I am seeing 
 Now my heart can't keep from singing 
 Open wide the gates tonight 
 Jesus, come and flood my life with grace amazing 
 Now I know in letting go 
 What it means to be set free by grace amazing 
 We sing, You are God and You are holy 
 We sing, only You can set us free 
 We sing, You are God and You are holy 
 We sing, only You can set us free 
 Open wide the gates tonight 
 Jesus, come and flood my life with grace amazing 
 Now I know in letting go 
 What it means to be set free by grace amazing, by grace amazing 
 Oh, now I know in letting go 
 What it means to be set free by grace amazing

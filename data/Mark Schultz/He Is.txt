Father, let the world just fade away 
 Let me feel your presence in this place 
 Lord, I've never been so weary 
 How I need to know you're near me 
 Father, let the world just fade away 
 Till I'm on my knees 
 Till my heart can sing 
 He is 
 He was 
 He always will be 
 Even when it feels like there is no one holding me 
 Be still, my soul 
 He is 
 Father, let your Holy Spirit sing 
 Let it calm the storm inside of me 
 As I stand amazed 
 Lift my hands and say 
 He is 
 He was 
 He always will be 
 He lives 
 He loves 
 He's always with me 
 Even when it feels like there is no one holding me 
 Be still, my soul 
 Through every fear 
 And every doubt 
 And every tear I shed 
 Down every road 
 I'm not alone 
 No matter where I am 
 He is 
 He was 
 And He always will be 
 He lives 
 He loves 
 He's always with me 
 Even when it feels like there is no one holding me 
 Be still, my soul 
 Be still, and know 
 Be still, my soul 
 He is

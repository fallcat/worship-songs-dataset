I'm down on my knees again tonight 
 I'm hoping this prayer will turn out right 
 See there is a boy that needs your help 
 I've done all that I can do myself 
 His mother is tired 
 I'm sure you can understand 
 Each night as he sleeps 
 She goes in to hold his hand 
 And she tries not to cry 
 As the tears fill her eyes 
 Can you hear me? 
 Am I getting through tonight? 
 Can you see him? 
 Can you make him feel all right? 
 If you can hear me 
 Let me take his place somehow 
 See, he's not just anyone 
 He's my son 
 Sometimes late at night I watch him sleep 
 I dream of the boy he'd like to be 
 I try to be strong and see him through 
 But God who he needs right now is You 
 Let him grow old 
 Live life without this fear 
 What would I be 
 Living without him here 
 He's so tired and he's scared 
 Let him know that You're there 
 Can you hear me? 
 Am I getting through tonight? 
 Can you see him? 
 Can you make him feel all right? 
 If you can hear me 
 Let me take his place somehow 
 See he's not just anyone 
 He's my son 
 Can you hear me? 
 Can you see him? 
 Please don't leave him 
 He's my son

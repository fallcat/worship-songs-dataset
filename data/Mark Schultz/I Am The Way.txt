You've got a secret no one knows 
 Locked away where no one goes 
 Deep inside your heart, 
 It's tearin' you apart. 
 You hide the pain in all you do, 
 Still the shackles binding you are heavier than stone, 
 But you are not alone. 
 When you're down 
 Look around 
 And you'll see I am with you. 
 Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you. 
 Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know: 
 I am the answer, 
 And I am the way. 
 I am the promise, 
 And I have called your name. 
 So you want a brand new start 
 Askin' Me into your heart, 
 Down on bended knee 
 For the world to see. 
 And the chains around your heart 
 Fall away and break apart 
 Suddenly you see 
 The truth has set you free. 
 When you're down 
 Look around 
 And you'll see I am with you 
 Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you 
 Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know: 
 I am the answer, 
 And I am the way. 
 I am the promise, and 
 I have called your name. 
 Surrounded by darkness 
 You stumbled along 
 Knowing the road that you traveled was long 
 But I'm here beside you, 
 Yes here all along, 
 The One that will carry you on. 
 When you're down 
 Look around 
 And you'll see I am with you. 
 Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you. 
 Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know. 
 I am the answer, 
 And I am the way, 
 I am the promise and 
 I have called. 
 Oh when you are down 
 You think no one's around, 
 But I'll be with you both night and day. 
 I know the good times, 
 I'll see you through bad times, 
 Oh you know that I'm here to stay. 
 I am the answer, 
 And I am the way 
 I am the promise, 
 And I have called your name. 
 Yeah, yeah 
 When you're down 
 Look around 
 And you'll see I am with you.

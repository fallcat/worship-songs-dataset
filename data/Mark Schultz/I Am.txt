I am the maker of the Heavens 
 I am the bright and morning star 
 I am the breath of all Creation 
 Who always was 
 And Is to come 
 I am the One who walked on water 
 I am the One who calmed the seas 
 I am the miracles and wonders 
 So come and see 
 And follow me 
 And you will know 
 That I am the fount of living water 
 The risen Son of man 
 The healer of the broken 
 And when you cry 
 I am your savior and redeemer 
 Who bore the sin of man 
 The author and perfecter 
 Beginning and the end 
 Yes I AM 
 I am the spirit deep inside you 
 I am the word upon your heart 
 I am the One who even knew you 
 Before your birth 
 Before you were 
 I am the fount of living water 
 The risen Son of man 
 The healer of the broken 
 And when you cry 
 I am your savior and redeemer 
 Who bore the sin of man 
 The author and perfecter 
 Beginning and the end 
 Yes I Am 
 Before the Earth (I am) 
 The universe (I am) 
 In every heart (I am) 
 Oh, where you are (I am) 
 The Lord of love (I am) 
 The King of Kings (I am) 
 The Holy lamb (I am) 
 Above all things 
 I am the fount of living water 
 The risen Son of man 
 The healer of the broken 
 And when you cry 
 I am your savior and redeemer 
 Who bore the sin of man 
 The author and perfecter 
 Beginning and the end 
 Yes I Am 
 Yes, I am almighty God your father 
 The risen son of man 
 The healer of the broken 
 And when you cry 
 I am your savior and redeemer 
 Who bore the sin of man 
 The author and perfecter 
 Beginning and the end 
 Yes I Am 
 Yes I Am 
 Yes I Am 
 Oh, I Am

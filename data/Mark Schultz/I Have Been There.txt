In a room without a view, a new mother smiles 
 And holds the tiny fingers of her brand new baby girl 
 Her husband takes her by the hand, so unsure about the future 
 And no money can they make it in this world? 
 And they pray, "Lord all we have to give is love" 
 And they heard a gentle voice like an echo from above 
 "I have been there, I know what fear is all about 
 Yes, I have been there and I'm standing with you now 
 I have been there and I came to build the bridge 
 Oh, so this road will lead you home, oh, I have been there" 
 He's been a pastor twenty years but tonight he sits alone 
 And broken hearted in the corner of the church 
 He tried to change a fallen world with his words and with his wisdom 
 But it seems like it is only getting worse 
 And he cries, "Oh Lord, I just don't understand" 
 Then he felt the hand of grace and he heard a voice that said 
 "I have been there I know what pain is all about 
 Yes, I have been there and I'm standing with you now 
 I have been there and I came to build a bridge 
 Oh, so this road will lead you home, oh, I have been there" 
 An older man up on a hill holding flowers 
 But he can't hold back the tears 
 Oh he has come to say goodbye 
 He thinks about the life she lived 
 Thinks about how hard it's been to live without her 
 Sixty years right by his side 
 And he cries, "Oh Lord, I loved her till the end" 
 And he heard a gentle voice say, "You'll see her once again" 
 "I have been there I know what sorrow's all about 
 Yes, I have been there and I'm standing with you now 
 I have been there and I came to build a bridge 
 Oh, so this road will lead her home, the road will lead her home 
 "Oh, I have been there you know I overcame the cross 
 Yes, I have been there so her life would not be lost 
 Oh, I have been there and I came to build a bridge 
 So this road will lead you home, the road will lead you home" 
 "Oh, I have been there 
 Yes, I have been there"

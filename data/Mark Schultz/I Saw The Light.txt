I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light 
 He lived in a crowded Jamaican infirmary 
 Many were brought there to die 
 Days of starvation, complete deprivation, 
 And illness had taken his sight 
 But a doctor came to the village there 
 And treated him with the finest care 
 Said that time would tell 
 The doctor went to bed that night 
 And when he awoke in the morning light 
 The man could not be found 
 He was singing from a hill 
 Oh I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 And he sang Amazing Grace to show 
 A loving God for all to know 
 With love and faith and grace 
 Oh I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 We met and my eyes could not hide how I felt 
 When I looked at him tattered and torn 
 But he captured me with a smile that seemed so 
 Out of place from the pain he'd endured 
 And he told me of a sacrifice 
 That had given him eternal life 
 He was not alone 
 He spoke about a greater plan 
 And I began to understand 
 My life was not my own 
 And I am here to say 
 That I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 And I sing amazing grace to show 
 A loving God for all to know 
 With love and faith and grace 
 Oh I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 I can see (I saw the light, I saw the light, oh I saw the light) 
 Amazing Grace how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me oh 
 I once was lost but now am found 
 Was blind but now I see

I know there's a hole inside of me that's nine foot wide 
 I know 'cause I've tried to fill it up with foolish pride 
 And You go and You take my trophies off the ledges 
 Idols I had kept instead of wanting what was real 
 I that I've worn a thousand costumes in my life 
 I know so that no one else could see me deep inside 
 And You go and peel away from the perfect faces 
 Dust me off and then You say it's 
 Time to be yourself 
 ~And it's been a long time~ 
 ~Been a long time~ 
 ~Been a long time for me~ 
 ~You've opened my eyes~ 
 ~And I've realized~ 
 ~It's been a long time to see~ 
 ~Who I am...~ 
 I know there's a little boy in me trapped deep inside 
 I know he's so afraid to fail and so he hides 
 And You go and You open up a door within me 
 Take him by the hand and say we need to step outside 
 And like a bird I want to fly away from here 
 Don't want to look inside this broken heart of mine 
 It's where You tell me there's so much I have 
 To give away 
 So much to give to You 
 So much I buried deep inside of me 
 Beyond a wall of memories 
 You brought me here to set me free 
 The more I look the more I see that it's

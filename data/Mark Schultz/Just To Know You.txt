Oh Christ 
 Had the choice 
 Oh, to set us free 
 And He broke through the darkness 
 And came with a passion 
 Gave up the Heavens 
 To take up the fight 
 He poured out His heart 
 And He fought for our freedom 
 Hung on a cross 
 And then gave up his life 
 ~Just to know You... fought for me~ 
 ~Oh really know You... set me free~ 
 ~Just to know You... died for love~ 
 ~Oh really know You... God above~ 
 Oh and I 
 Have a choice 
 And the choice for me 
 Is to live life like a man 
 Who will love with abandon 
 Follow the promise 
 And pay any price 
 I'll give all I can 
 Just to stand in Your glory 
 And long for the day 
 Oh to look in Your eyes 
 I want to live 
 I want to love 
 I want to finsh strong 
 I want to run 
 Into Your arms 
 And say I gave it all

The wind blows hard against this mountainside 
 Across the sea into my soul 
 It reaches in to where I cannot hide 
 Setting my feet upon the road 
 My heart is old it holds my memories 
 This heart it burns a gem like flame

 Kyrie Eleison through the darkness of the night 
 Kyrie Eleison where I go you will follow 
 Kyrie Eleison on a highway in the light 
 When I was young I dreamed of growing old 
 Of what my life would mean to me 
 Would I have traveled down my chosen road 
 Or only wish that I could be

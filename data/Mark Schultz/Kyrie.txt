Kyrie eleison 
 Kyrie eleison 
 Kyrie 
 The wind blows hard against this mountain side 
 Across the sea into my soul 
 It reaches into where I cannot hide 
 Setting my feet upon the road 
 My heart is old, it holds my memories 
 My body burns a gem like flame 
 Somewhere between the soul and soft machine 
 Is where I find myself again 
 Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel 
 Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night 
 Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow? 
 Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light 
 When I was young I thought of growing old 
 Of what my life would mean to me 
 Would I have followed down my chosen road 
 Or only wished what I could be 
 Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel 
 Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night 
 Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow? 
 Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light

I'm holdin' this picture 
 You drew when you were four 
 It was one we proudly hung 
 On our refrigerator door 
 I found it in the attic 
 In your old dresser drawer 
 By a pillow that we made you 
 A blanket that you had 
 When we learned to chase the monsters 
 From underneath your bed 
 And I remember 
 How I learned hold you when you cried 
 I Learned how to let you be strong 
 Learned how to calm you in the dark 
 Learn how to listen with my heart 
 I Learned how to watch you grow 
 But how will I learn to let go 
 When I walk in you're in your bedroom 
 The memories that I keep 
 Are bedtime stories 
 And rockin' you to sleep 
 And as I held you 
 You'd drift off to dream 
 And I know this might sound crazy 
 Now that you have grown 
 But yesterday still feels 
 Like the day we brought you home 
 And I remember 
 How I learned how to hold you when you cried 
 Learned how to let you be strong 
 Learned how to calm you in the dark 
 Learned how to listen with my heart 
 Learned how to watch you grow 
 But how will I learn 
 When will I learn 
 How will I learn 
 To let go

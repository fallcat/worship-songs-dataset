Long ago on the Texas Plains 
 Was a little town 
 That never changed 
 Until a man rode into town, 
 A Ranger known for miles around 
 Well, he could keep the peace 
 Without a gun 
 From Abilene down to Galveston 
 When he rode by the general store 
 People crowded through the door 
 To see the legend and the man called McBride, 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh, woh 
 In Iverson 
 Through the doors of the old hotel 
 A burnin' fire began to build 
 People screamin' for their lives, 
 And the first one there was john McBride. 
 And just as soon 
 As he stepped in 
 People saw the roof cave in, 
 And everybody knew 
 That he would not survive 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh, woh 
 In Iverson 
 Than a lady right outside, 
 Said her baby boy was trapped inside 
 But not a man would fight the flames, 
 And she knew 
 That it would be too late 
 But through the smoke 
 And burnin flames 
 She heard her baby 
 Call her name 
 The boy appeared 
 But no one knew 
 Who saved his life. 
 And when the boy grew old and gray 
 He spoke about that fateful day, 
 And the man that saved his life, 
 Texas Ranger, john McBride 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh, woh 
 In Iverson 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh, woh, 
 And oh, woh woh 
 Still I travel far and wide, 
 Yeah 
 To hear the legend of McBride. Yeah

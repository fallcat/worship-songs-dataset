You gotta nice job in an office on the 
 Seventh floor 
 Oh but you're looking out the window 
 And you're thinking that there's 
 Something more 
 You clear your head 
 You close your eyes 
 But something deep inside you cries 
 Let's go, let's go to the great unknown 
 Find the one that rolled away the stone 
 Let's go to the four inch hole 
 Find a way to give like we never gave before 
 Let's go, going far and wide 
 Pack your bag and leave it all behind 
 What are we waiting for 
 Let's go 
 Back home through the middle of the 
 Parking lot 
 You give away the car 
 Give away the money that you've got 
 Neighbors will talk 
 And oh they should 
 Saying something ain't right 
 In the neighborhood

She run to the mailbox 
 On that bright summer's day 
 Found a letter from her son 
 In a war far away 
 He spoke of the weather 
 And good friends that he'd made 
 Said I'd been thinking 'bout dad 
 And the life that he had 
 That's why I'm here today 
 Then at the end he said 
 You are what I'm fighting for 
 It was the first of his letters from war 
 She started writing 
 You're good and you're brave 
 What a father that you'll be someday 
 Make it home, make it safe 
 She wrote every night as she prayed 
 Late in December 
 A day she'll not forget 
 Oh, her tears stained the paper 
 With every word that she read 
 It said "I was up on a hill 
 I was out there alone 
 When the shots all rang out 
 And bombs were exploding 
 And that's when I saw him 
 He came back for me 
 Though he was captured 
 A man set me free 
 That man was your son 
 He asked me to write to you 
 I told him I would, oh, I swore" 
 It was the last of her letters from war 
 And she prayed he was living 
 Kept on believing and 
 Wrote every night just to say 
 You are good and you're brave 
 What a father that you'll be someday 
 Make it home, make it safe 
 Still she kept writing each day 
 Then two years later 
 Autumn leaves all around 
 A car pulled in the driveway 
 And she fell to the ground 
 And out stepped a captain 
 Where her boy used to stand 
 He said, "Mom I'm following orders 
 From all of your letters 
 And I've come home again" 
 He ran in to hold her 
 And dropped all his bags on the floor 
 Holding all of her letters from war 
 Bring it home 
 Bring it home 
 Bring it home

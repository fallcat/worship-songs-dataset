She packed up her bags and she turned to tell them goodbye 
 She kissed her dad and promised her momma she'd write 
 For 18 years she'd been their baby 
 Oh, but now she will learn how to fly 
 Live like you're loved by the Lord up above 
 Spread out your wings and never give up 
 'Cause you can do anything, be who you're meant to be 
 Always remember to dream and keep your head up 
 And live like you're loved 
 Now she's out on her own making her way in this life 
 And some days are fair, but some days she barely gets by 
 But when she feels alone, she picks up the phone just to hear her daddy's voice 
 He says ?I tell the whole world I'm proud of you girl? 
 And before she tells him goodbye, he says 
 Live like you're loved by the Lord up above 
 Spread out your wings and never give up 
 'Cause you can do anything, be who you're meant to be 
 Always remember to dream and keep your head up 
 And live like 
 You're loved by the Lord of the whole universe 
 Loved by the Maker of heaven and earth 
 Loved by the Father again and again 
 Loved with a love without end 
 Live like you're loved by the Lord up above 
 Spread out your wings and never give up 
 'Cause you can do anything, be who you're meant to be 
 Always remember to dream and keep your head up 
 And live like you're loved 
 Live like you're loved 
 Oh, live like you're loved

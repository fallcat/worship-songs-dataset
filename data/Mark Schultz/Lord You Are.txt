Lord, You are the King of all creation 
 You know my name 
 Lord, You are the hope of every nation 
 You never change 
 So I stand, I stand before You now 
 And raise my hands 
 And I sing to You 
 For You alone are worthy 
 And Your word is truth 
 And I sing to You 
 You are the song within me 
 And I long for You 
 Lord, You are 
 Lord, Your word is written deep within me 
 Spelled out by grace 
 Lord, You are the rock of all the ages 
 My help and strength 
 So I stand, stand before you now 
 And raise my hands 
 The Living One, the Holy Lamb 
 The Son of God, the Son of Man 
 Who always is, who always was 
 Who's always gonna be

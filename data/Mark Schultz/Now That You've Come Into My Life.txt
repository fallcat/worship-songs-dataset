Now That You've Come Into My Life 
 (Mark Schulz) 
 Now that You've come in 
 Now that You've come into my life 
 All that was faded 
 All that was faded is like a heartbeat 
 That's been restored 
 Like a faith that has been reborn 
 In the end 
 In the end 
 Yeah, we were under the same moon 
 We were under the same sky 
 We were searching for something 
 But I just didn't realize 
 That all that I needed 
 All that I needed all this time 
 You're just what I wanted 
 Now that You've come into my life 
 Now that you've come in 
 Now that you've come into my life 
 All that was broken 
 All that was broken is like the way it was meant to be 
 Like a feeling, Iv'e been set free 
 In the end 
 In the end 
 Not afraid 
 Anymore 
 Anymore 
 Not afraid

Remember me 
 In a Bible cracked and faded by the years 
 Remember me 
 In a sanctuary filled with silent prayer 
 And age to age 
 And heart to heart 
 Bound by grace and peace 
 Child of wonder 
 Child of God 
 I've remembered you 
 Remember me 
 Remember me 
 When the color of a sunset fills the sky 
 Remember me 
 When you pray and tears of joy 
 Fall from your eyes 
 Remember me 
 When the children leave 
 Their Sunday school with smiles 
 Remember me 
 When they're old enough to teach 
 Old enough to preach 
 Old enough to lead 
 Age to age and heart to heart 
 Child of wonder child of God 
 Remember me 
 Age to age and heart to heart 
 Child of wonder child of God

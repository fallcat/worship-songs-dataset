I am driving 
 I am late for work 
 Spilling coffee 
 Down my whitest shirt 
 While I'm flossing 
 And I'm changing lanes 
 Oh Yeah 
 Now I'm driving 
 Through the parking lot 
 Doing eighty 
 Hey what the heck why not 
 Watch it lady 
 'Cause you're in my spot 
 Once again 
 It's early to work 
 And here's a surprise 
 I got a McMuffin for just 99 cents today 
 I think they ran a special 
 I can't stand still 
 Can I get a witness 
 Can you hear me 
 Anybody, anybody 
 I think I am running just to catch myself 
 Maybe someday I could fly away 
 Go to Key Largo or Montego Bay 
 Sport my speedo, maybe grab a tan 
 A dream vacation, wild elation 
 Now I'm running 
 Straight into my boss 
 And he's angry 
 Oh and he calls me Ross 
 Which is funny 
 'Cause that ain't my name 
 And that's lame 
 I'm still running 
 Running very late 
 For a meeting 
 Wait, that was yesterday 
 Guess I'm early for the one next week 
 Oh how sweet 
 I get on the ladder 
 I corporately climb 
 I wave at my life as it passes me by every day 
 My name's not Ross 
 Life in my cubicle is discreet 
 Life in my cubicle is neat 
 I've got some pictures of my friends 
 Some sharpened pencils... where's my pen 
 Ten O'clock I'm in a meeting 
 Paper cut I think I'm bleeding 
 Check my hair it's still receding 
 Hey what a life 
 Break for lunch 
 There's nothing better 
 Run outside and don my sweater 
 Like Fred Rogers let's be neighbors 
 I've lost my mind 
 I'm over worked 
 And underpaid 
 And non-appreciated 
 It's just a perk of being of being 
 Middle class 
 And educated 
 One... spinning circles in my chair 
 Two... win a game of solitaire 
 Three... And I ponder where my stapler's gone 
 Four O'clock and I stare at the door 
 And I stare at my watch 
 Then I stare at the door 
 I stand by my desk like I'm going to war 
 There's just one thing I'll be needing 
 Grab my paycheck as I'm leaving 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 It's five o'clock 
 It's time to go 
 There's crowds to fight 
 And horns to blow 
 It's talking fast on my cell phone 
 Hey watch out that's reckless driving 
 Five O'clock 
 It's time to leave 
 To hit the couch 
 And watch TV 
 Set the clock and go to sleep 
 It's 8 am on Monday morning 
 Again and again and again and again and again 
 Driving around 
 Nowhere to go 
 And so I hang with my lady Oh, 
 And chill with my bro's 
 It's okay, in my Cabriolet 
 I can't stand still 
 Can I get a witness 
 Can you hear me 
 Anybody, anybody 
 I think I am running just to catch myself 
 When I meet God 
 I will have a question 
 I just forgot my question 
 I think I am running just to catch myself 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh

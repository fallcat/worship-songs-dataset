He always called her daddy's little girl 
 She was four years old 
 Waiting by the door to run into his arms 
 Each time that he came home 
 And every night he tucked her in and read to her in bed 
 When she'd fall asleep he'd close his eyes and gently bow his head 
 But she was watching 
 Her daddy praying 
 And thought someday I wanna be like that 
 She was watchin what he was saying 
 And the way he bowed his head 
 And though she can't recall the prayer 
 She was watching 
 Late one evening he was coming home from work 
 He called to say he'd lost his job 
 And after dinner they excused their baby girl 
 She knew they had to talk 
 But from inside her bedroom 
 She could hear them down the hall 
 They were dancing in the kitchen as momma sang his favorite song 
 She was watching 
 As they were dancing 
 And thought someday I wanna be like that 
 She was watching 
 Her momma singing 
 As they were dancing hand in hand 
 And though she can't recall the song 
 She was watching 
 Faith can't be taught 
 It's just something that is caught along the way 
 No faith is never taught 
 It's just something that they catch from watching you along the 
 Way 
 He always called her daddy's little girl 
 But now she's twenty-three 
 He walks her down the aisle to give away his world 
 Oh but he can hardly speak 
 And when he kisses her goodbye he tries to hold it in 
 But as he turns away she pulls him close and whispers in his ear 
 I was watching 
 And I've been waiting 
 And finally found someone just like you 
 I was watching 
 My whole life praying 
 For God to see it through 
 And as he kissed her one last time 
 He said a prayer and closed his eyes 
 And she was watching

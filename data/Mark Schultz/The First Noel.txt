The First Noel, the Angels did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay 
 In fields as they lay keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel! 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel! 
 Then entered in those Wise men three 
 Full reverently upon their knee 
 And offered there in His presence 
 Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel! 
 Then let us all with one accord 
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord 
 That hath made Heaven and earth of nought 
 And with his blood mankind hath bought. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel! 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel!

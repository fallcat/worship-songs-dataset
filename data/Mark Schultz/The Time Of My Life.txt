Words and Music by Mark Schultz 
 From the recording: Song Cinema, Track #9. 
 He packed his bags when he was just 18 
 To see a world he thought he'd never seen 
 But he knew when he met her 
 That she was the girl 
 He'd been waiting for 
 And each night they spent talking on the front porch swing 
 And like it came straight out of a movie scene 
 But one night she stepped out as the sun began to set 
 When she got to the porch she found a letter that read 
 You're the only girl I'll ever love 
 And I'd do anything not to give you up 
 If I could only stop the world 
 When you're standing by my side 
 See I'm having the time of my life 
 Yes, I'm having the time of my life 
 The months went by it was their wedding day 
 A church on a hill wedding bells rang away 
 She looked like a princess 
 All dressed up in pearls 
 It was her proudest day 
 And he stood all alone in a darkened church hallway 
 He got down on his knees and he started to pray 
 He thanked the Lord for his family and the perfect bride 
 But he couldn't hold back what he was feelin' inside 
 And he said 
 She's the only girl I'll ever love 
 And I'd do anything not to give her up 
 If I could only stop the world 
 When she's standing by my side 
 See, I'm having the time of my life 
 Yes, I'm having the time of my life 
 Forty years went by and she lived most of God's plan 
 She stood alone in an attic, wedding dress in her hand 
 And she held an old letter written so long ago 
 But she'd never forget it 
 No matter how old 
 And as she turned to put the dress away 
 And pack up the years 
 He was standing in the doorway 
 With his eyes full of tears 
 And he held her 
 'Cause you're the only girl I'll ever love 
 And I'd do anything not to give you up 
 If I could only stop the world 
 When you're standing by my side 
 See I'm having the time of my life 
 Yes, I'm having the time of my life

Packing my bag since morning was the hardest thing to do, 
 But packing my bag was so easy than to standing outside your door 
 Right now to say goodbye, 
 Think of me... 
 I know you've never seen me cry, 
 Think of me... 
 But it's so hard to say goodbye, 
 Think of me... 
 What can I say to show you, 
 I'll never give up on you 
 I will be waiting for you 
 I will be there when you call 
 I will see you through it all 
 And even in your darkest hour, 
 I pray that the Lord we found 
 Will set you on solid ground 
 I know that it feels like leaving 
 Is a part of letting go 
 But I'm praying with hope and believing 
 That I'll see you once again down this road 
 I hope that it won't be long 
 Think of me... 
 I know God brought you as a friend, 
 Think of me... 
 I know he'll bring you back again, 
 Think of me... 
 What can I say to show you, 
 I'll never give up on you 
 I will be waiting for you 
 I will be there when you call 
 I will see you through it all 
 And even in your darkest hour, 
 I pray that the Lord we found 
 Will set you on solid ground 
 Think of me... 
 I know you've never seen me cry 
 Think of me... 
 But it's so hard to say goodbye 
 Think of me... 
 What can I say to show you 
 I'll never give up on you 
 I will be waiting for you 
 I will be there when you call 
 I will see you through it all 
 And even in your darkest hour, 
 I pray that the Lord we found 
 Will set you on solid ground

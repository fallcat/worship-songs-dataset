What will you do with the time that's left? 
 Will you live it all with no regret? 
 Will they say that you loved till your final breath? 
 What will you do with the time that's left? 
 Oh hallelujah, oh hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, amen 
 And what will you with the time that's past? 
 Oh and all the pain that seems to last? 
 Can you give it to Jesus and not look back? 
 What will you do with the time that's past? 
 And what will He say when your time has come? 
 And He takes you into His arms of love 
 With tears in His your eyes will He say "well done"? 
 What will you say when your time has come?

Oh child, precious one 
 Let your life shine like the sun 
 But you say, "How long till I can come home, 
 Till I can rest in Your arms again?" 
 And I say, "Not long, but don't miss this life, 
 And I'll be waiting till then... 
 Live with the wonder of a child 
 Pray with your arms thrown open wide 
 Love with a love that has no end 
 Until I see you again." 
 Oh child, precious one 
 With each breath know you are loved 
 But you say, "How long till I can come home, 
 Till I can rest in Your arms again?" 
 And I say, "Not long, but don't miss this life, 
 And I'll be waiting till then... 
 Live with the wonder of a child 
 Pray with your arms thrown open wide 
 Love with a love that has no end 
 Until I see you again." 
 Live with the wonder of a child 
 Pray with your arms thrown open wide 
 Love with a love that has no end 
 Until I see you again 
 Until I see you again 
 Oh, and I'll see you again.

Looking back 
 He sees it all 
 It was her first date the night he came to call 
 Her dad said son 
 Have her home on time 
 And promise me you'll never leave her side 
 He took her to a show in town 
 And he was ten feet off the ground 
 He was walking her home 
 And holding her hand 
 Oh the way she smiled it stole the breath right out of him 
 Down that old road 
 With the stars up above 
 He remembers where he was the night he fell in love 
 He was walking her home 
 Ten more years and a waiting room 
 At half past one 
 And the doctor said come in and meet your son 
 His knees went weak 
 When he saw his wife 
 She was smiling as she said he's got your eyes 
 And as she slept he held her tight 
 His mind went back to that first night 
 He was walking her home 
 And holding her hand 
 Oh the way she smiled it stole the breath right out of him 
 Down that old road 
 With the stars up above 
 He remembers where he was the night he fell in love 
 He was walking her home 
 He walked her through the best days of her life 
 Sixty years together and he never left her side 
 A nursing home 
 At eighty-five 
 And the doctor said it could be her last night 
 And the nurse said Oh 
 Should we tell him now 
 Or should he wait until the morning to find out 
 When they checked her room that night 
 He was laying by her side 
 Oh he was walking her home 
 And holding her hand 
 Oh the way she smiled when he said this is not the end 
 And just for a while they were eighteen 
 And she was still more beautiful to him than anything 
 He was walking her home 
 He was walking her home 
 Looking back 
 He sees it all 
 It was her first date the night he came to call

 When I'm calling out can you hear me calling Jesus? 
 When I'm crying out can you hear me crying Jesus? 
 Holy Lamb 
 Great I am 
 How long, how long? Until we see Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus we are calling You 
 Jesus, Jesus we are calling You 
 Language: Kituba (Kikongo) 
 Be to ke lombila Yesu-(we are praying to Jesus) 
 Yamba ye-(Welcome Him; literally, embrace Him, give Him a hug) 
 Yangalala-(joy) 
 Landu Nzila-(follow the path, the path of God to Heaven) 
 Nzila ya Nzambi nazulu

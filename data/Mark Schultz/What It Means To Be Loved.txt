For five months and eight days my wife and I had waited 
 Gettin' ready for our baby girl 
 But when he called the doctor said I need to see you 
 And could you come in soon 
 Then something died inside of me to sit with him and hear 
 The tests that said our baby may not live to be a year 
 Then turnin' to my wife and he said "whata you wanna do?" 
 And she said... 
 I wanna give her the world 
 I wanna hold her hand 
 I wanna be her mom for as long as I can 
 And I wanna live every moment until that day comes 
 I wanna show her what it means to be loved 
 So we spent each day, watchin' every minute 
 And prayin' for our baby girl 
 And I will not forget the way I felt that moment 
 When she came into this world 
 But they took her from the room just as soon as she was born 
 And watchin' through a window I could see her holdin' on 
 When a voice inside me said... 
 I wanna give her the world 
 I wanna be her dad 
 I wanna hold her close for as long as I can 
 And I wanna live every moment until that day comes 
 I wanna show her what it means to be loved 
 I said everyday 
 We've got to bring her home 
 She's been out to prove the doctors wrong 
 Oh and you should see her now 
 She's as pretty as her mom 
 And there's a boy at the front door waiting just to take her to her high school prom... 
 And he wants to give her the world 
 Wants to hold her hand 
 And someday she may get a wedding band 
 But she's gunna live every moment until that day comes 
 And we're gunna show her what it means to be loved 
 Oh yeah (what it means to be loved) 
 Show her what it means to be loved 
 What it means to be loved

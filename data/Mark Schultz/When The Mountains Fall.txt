Words and Music by Mark Schultz 
 From the recording: Song Cinema, Track #1. 
 You stand on the edge 
 You followed the call 
 No turning back you are risking it all 
 He whispers your name 
 In a moment of truth 
 The rocks fall around you 
 The ground starts to move 
 You step out on faith 
 It's all that you know 
 You jump into darkness and hold onto hope 
 When the mountains fall 
 When the rivers rise 
 Security crumbles before your eyes 
 The one thing you know 
 In faith you'll find 
 Something to stand on or you will be taught to fly 
 So dream your dreams 
 And live your life 
 Knowing there's more than to merely survive 
 Don't give up, don't give in 
 Fight through the rain and lean into the wind 
 'Til you come to the edge of all that you know 
 Run right through the dark knowing you're not alone 
 When you walk through the fire 
 It will not consume you 
 Though the water will rise 
 It won't overtake you 
 Though the mountains will fall 
 Oh, still I am with you 
 I've called you by name 
 And I will not leave you 
 I'm learning to trust you 
 I'm learning to fly 
 I'm learning to trust you 
 I'm learning to fly

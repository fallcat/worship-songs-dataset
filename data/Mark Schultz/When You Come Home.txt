My first day of recess 
 They all laughed at me 
 When I fell off the swing set 
 And scraped up my knee. 
 The nurse called my Momma 
 To say I'd be late 
 And when she gave me the phone 
 I could hear Momma say, 
 I'm so sorry, son 
 Oh I think you're so brave 
 And she was smiling when she said 
 When you come home 
 No matter how far 
 Run through the door and into my arms 
 It's where you are loved 
 It's where you belong 
 And I will be here 
 When you come home 
 I waved good-bye through the window 
 As I boarded the plane 
 My first job in Houston was waiting for me 
 I found a letter from Momma 
 Tucked in my coat 
 And as I flew down the runway 
 I smiled when she wrote 
 I miss you son 
 You'll be so far away 
 But I'll be waiting for the day 
 Well I don't think she can hear you now 
 The doctor told me. 
 Your mother is fading 
 It's best that you leave 
 So I whispered I love you 
 And then turned away 
 But I stopped at the door 
 When I heard Momma say 
 I love you son 
 But they're callin' me away 
 Promise me before I go

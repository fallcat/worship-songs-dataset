King of Kings 
 Lord of Lords

 I am 
 Early morning, summer's day 
 At a park, in the city 
 Kids were playing on a swing 
 They were black and white 
 Then a lady walked that way 
 As she did most every morning 
 Grocery bags in her hand 
 She was passing by 
 She stopped 
 Stared 
 Watched their laughter fill the air 
 She laughed 
 Cried 
 Because the love of God was color blind... 
 When you give 
 When you learn 
 When you serve 
 You do it unto me 
 On a cross, up on a hill 
 Where the world would be forgiven 
 Was a man, called to make the greatest sacrifice 
 He lived a life of love, gave away all He'd been given 
 Sent from the one above, and He gave His life 
 To love, serve 
 He came down from Heaven to spread the word 
 To teach, pray 
 And this is what He had to say 
 Give away all you've been given 
 This is what you're looking for deep inside 
 Jesus Christ 
 Take me to the river 
 Wash in the water 
 Take me to the river 
 Dunk me in the water 
 King of Kings 
 Lord of Lords 
 Prince of Peace 
 I Am

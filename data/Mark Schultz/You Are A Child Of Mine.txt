I've been hearing voices 
 Telling me that I could 
 Never be what I wanna be. 
 They're binding me with lies, 
 Haunting me at night, 
 And saying there's nothing to believe. 
 Somewhere in the quietness, 
 When I'm overcome with loneliness, 
 I hear You call my name. 
 And like a father You are near 
 And as I listen I can hear You say 
 You are a child of Mine 
 Born of My own design 
 And you bear the heart of life. 
 No matter where you go, 
 Oh, you will always know 
 You have been made free in Christ. 
 You are a child of Mine 
 And so I listen as You tell me who I am 
 And who it is I'm gonna be. 
 And I hang on every word, 
 Knowing I have heard 
 I am Yours and I am free 
 But when I am alone at night 
 That is when I hear the lie 
 You'll never be enough 
 And though I'm giving into fear 
 If I listen I can hear You say 
 You are a child of Mine 
 Born of My own design 
 And you bear the heart of life. 
 No matter where you go, 
 Oh, you will always know 
 You have been made free in Christ. 
 You are a child of Mine 
 I am calling' 
 I am calling' 
 I am calling' 
 You are a child of Mine 
 Born of My own design 
 And you bear the heart of life. 
 No matter where you go, 
 Oh, you will always know 
 You have been made free in Christ. 
 You are a child of Mine

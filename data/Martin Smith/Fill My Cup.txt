Fill my cup, so it's overflowing 
 Flowing like a river, fill my cup 
 Fill my cup, fill it with Your mercy 
 Love and truth and justice, fill my cup 
 Oh Lord, the river's running high 
 So take me to the other side 
 Oh Lord, the tides are really high 
 So take me to the other side, oh fill my cup 
 Fill my cup, so it's overflowing 
 Flowing like a river, fill my cup 
 Take this cup, have it with Your glass 
 And pour it over nations, take this cup 
 Oh Lord, the river's running high 
 So take me to the other side 
 Oh Lord, the floods are really high 
 So take me to the other side, oh 
 Give us a living water overflowing through me 
 From the throne of God, overflowing through me 
 Give us a living water overflowing through me 
 From the throne of God, overflowing through me 
 Give us a living water overflowing through me 
 From the throne of God, overflowing through me 
 Ooh, overflowing through me, let it flow 
 Come on, come on, come on 
 Take us to the other side 
 Take us to the other side 
 Take us to the other side 
 Take us to the other side 
 Take us to the other side, oh 
 Take us to the other side 
 Take us to the other side, oh 
 Take us to the other side 
 Take us to the other side, oh 
 Take us to the other side 
 Take us to the other side, oh 
 Take us to the other side

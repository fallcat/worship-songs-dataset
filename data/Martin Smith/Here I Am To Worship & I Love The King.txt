Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness, 
 Opened my eyes, let me see 
 Beauty that made this heart adore You, 
 Hope of a life spent with You. 
 So here I am to worship; 
 Here I am to bow down; 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God. 
 And You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 King of all days, oh, so highly exalted, 
 Glorious in heaven above, 
 Humbly You came 
 To the earth You created, 
 All for love's sake became poor. 
 So here I am to worship; 
 Here I am to bow down; 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God. 
 And You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 Here I am to worship; 
 Here I am to bow down; 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God. 
 And You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 And I'll never know 
 How much it cost 
 To see my sin 
 Upon that cross. 
 Upon that cross. 
 Upon that cross. 
 So here I am to worship; 
 Here I am to bow down; 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God. 
 And You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 Here I am to worship; 
 Here I am to bow down; 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God. 
 And You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 Here I am to worship; 
 Here I am to bow down; 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God. 
 And You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 Here I am to worship; 
 Here I am to bow down; 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God. 
 And You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me.

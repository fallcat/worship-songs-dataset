There's nothing worth more, that will ever come close 
 No thing can compare, You're our living hope 
 Your Presence 
 I've tasted and seen, of the sweetest of Loves 
 Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is undone 
 In Your Presence 
 Holy Spirit You are welcome here 
 Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere 
 Your Glory God is what our hearts long for 
 To be overcome by Your Presence Lord 
 Let us become more aware of Your Presence 
 Let us experience the Glory of Your Goodness

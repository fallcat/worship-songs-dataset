Over the mountains and the sea, 
 Your river runs with love for me, 
 And I will open up my heart 
 And let the Healer set me free. 
 I'm happy to be in the truth, 
 And I will daily lift my hands: 
 For I will always sing of when 
 Your love came down. [Yeah!] 
 I could sing of Your love forever, 
 I could sing of Your love forever, 
 I could sing of Your love forever, 
 I could sing of Your love forever.

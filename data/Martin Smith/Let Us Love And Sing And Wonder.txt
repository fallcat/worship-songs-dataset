Let us love and sing and wonder 
 Let us praise the Savior's name 
 He has hushed the law's loud thunder 
 He has quenched Mt. Sinai's flame 
 Let us love the Lord who bought us 
 Pitied us when enemies 
 Called us by His grace and taught us 
 Gave us ears and gave us eyes 
 He has washed us with His blood 
 He has washed us with His blood 
 He has washed us with His blood 
 He presents our souls to God 
 Let us wonder grace and justice 
 Join and point to mercy's store 
 When through grace in Christ our trust is 
 Justice smiles and asks no more 
 He who washed us with his blood 
 He who washed us with his blood 
 He who washed us with his blood 
 Has secured our way to God 
 Let us praise and join the chorus 
 Of the saints enthroned on high 
 Here they trusted him before us 
 Now their praises fill the sky 
 He has washed us with his blood 
 He has washed us with his blood 
 He has washed us with his blood 
 He has washed us with his blood 
 He will bring us home to God

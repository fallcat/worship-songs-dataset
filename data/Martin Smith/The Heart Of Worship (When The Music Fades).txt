When the music fades 
 All is stripped away, 
 And I simply come 
 Longing just to bring 
 Something that's of worth 
 That will bless Your heart 
 I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself 
 Is not what You have required 
 You search much deeper within through the way things appear 
 You're looking into my heart 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You, all about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it 
 When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus 
 King of endless worth 
 No one could express how much You deserve 
 Though I'm weak and poor 
 All I have is Yours, every single breath 
 I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself 
 Is not what You have required 
 You search much deeper within through the way things appear 
 You're looking into my heart

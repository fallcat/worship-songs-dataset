You chose the cross with every breath 
 The perfect life, The perfect death 
 You chose the cross 
 A crown of thorns you wore for us 
 And crowned us with eternal life 
 You chose the cross 
 And though your soul was overwhelmed with pain 
 Obedient to death You overcame 
 I'm Lost in wonder 
 I'm lost in love 
 I'm lost in praise forevermore 
 Because of Jesus' unfailing love 
 I am forgiven 
 I am restored 
 You loosed the chords of sinfulness 
 And broke the chains of my disgrace 
 You chose the cross 
 Up from the grave victorious 
 You rose again so glorious 
 You chose the cross 
 The sorrow that surrounded you was mine 
 "Yet not my will but yours be done" You cried

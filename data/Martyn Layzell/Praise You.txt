You gave Your only Son 
 Came down from Heaven above 
 Endured the cross, so I might know 
 This love that reached for me 
 A love that sets me free 
 Your sacrifice has saved my soul 
 Today, I'm reminded of Your grace 
 Always living now to sing Your praise 
 Your praise 
 Praise You, Jesus, I praise You 
 I lift my hands and sing 
 Embrace You, I will embrace You 
 Savior and my King, my King 
 I could not earn this love 
 Such undeserved love 
 Jesus, I know, You are the way 
 You paid the price for me 
 Your blood was shed for me 
 And in Your mercy took my place 
 Today, I'm reminded of Your grace 
 Always living now to sing Your praise 
 Your praise 
 Praise You, Jesus, I praise You 
 I lift my hands and sing 
 Embrace You, I will embrace You 
 Savior and my King, my King 
 I will worship you 
 I will worship you 
 I will live for you 
 I will live for you 
 Today, I'm reminded of Your grace 
 Always living now to sing Your praise 
 Today, I'm reminded of Your grace 
 Always living now to sing Your praise 
 Your praise 
 Praise You, Jesus, I praise You 
 I lift my hands and sing 
 Embrace You, I will embrace You 
 Savior and my King 
 Praise You, Jesus I praise You 
 I lift my hands and sing 
 Embrace You, I will embrace You 
 Savior and my King, my King 
 I will worship you

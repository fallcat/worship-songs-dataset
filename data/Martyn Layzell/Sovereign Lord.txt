Sovereign Lord over all 
 You are reigning forever 
 Worship flows from our lips 
 We have come for just one glimpse 
 We sing hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Majesty, reign in me 
 Your right hand enfolding me 
 Earth adore, heaven sing 
 At the sight of Christ the king 
 Lord of Lords now enthroned 
 Who can stand in Your presence? 
 Fire of love, Holy One 
 You burn brighter than the sun

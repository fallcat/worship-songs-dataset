With all my heart I say I love You 
 And it's my reward to stand before You 
 With all my heart, with all my soul 
 With all my strength I worship You 
 You are my heart's desire 
 Nothing compares to You Jesus 
 My one desire I worship You 
 Passionate hearts on fire 
 Sing in this place for You 
 Bowing before Your throne to honor You 
 The life I live I'm living for You 
 And with every breath I say I love You 
 Every nation, all of creation 
 Every heart will sing Your praise with celebration 
 Songs of salvation bless Your name 
 Every nation, all of creation 
 Every heart will sing Your praise with celebration 
 Songs of salvation we proclaim

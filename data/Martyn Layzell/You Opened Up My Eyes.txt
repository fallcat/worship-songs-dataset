Not by words and not by deeds. But by grace we have been saved 
 And it is the gift of God, the faith we need 
 Not by strength and not by might. But with power from on high 
 So that we can only boast, boast in You 
 For once I was dead, now I'm alive. For freedom I'm set free 
 And in Your great love, life do I find. You opened up my eyes 
 Not with eloquence or fame. But with weakness and in shame 
 For the power of Your strength. Is then revealed 
 And the message of Your cross. Seemed such foolishness to some 
 But the mercy of Your grace is hidden there 
 What mercy, what mercy, what mercy beneath Your cross 
 Your mercy, Your mercy, Your mercy beneath Your cross

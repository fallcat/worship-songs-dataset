For the spirit of the Lord God is upon me 
 Because He has anointed me to preach good news 
 Take away all of the sorrow and your mourning 
 To give the oil of joy and the garment of praise 
 For I have seen you in your captivity 
 And I will open up every prison door 
 So arise, and shine for your light is coming 
 And My glory is rising upon You 
 And I am dancing over you 
 And I am singing over you 
 Songs of deliverance 
 And I will set every captive free 
 And you will be with me 
 For you are mine 
 And I will carry the weight 
 Of all your iniquities 
 I've carried the burden 
 Of all your shame 
 And I've called you by name 
 I've called you by name 
 And you are mine

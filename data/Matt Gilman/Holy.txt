Here we are, God 
 We come before the throne of grace 
 Here we are, God 
 We come before the mercy seat 
 I can see the lightning 
 I can feel the thunder 
 I can hear the voices proceeding from Your throne 
 I can see the lightning 
 I can feel the thunder 
 I can hear the voices proceeding from Your throne 
 Twenty-four elders bowing low 
 Casting down their crowns of gold, yeah 
 And four living creatures crying out 
 Day and night 
 Night and day 
 And only one word comes to mind 
 There's only one word to describe 
 Only one word comes to mind 
 Only one word to describe 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 There is no one like You 
 You are holy, holy 
 There is no one like You 
 You are holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 Holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 And only one word comes to mind 
 There's only one word to describe

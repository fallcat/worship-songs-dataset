By the crimson stain upon Your robe 
 With every nail with every pounding blow 
 By every stripe and every bruise upon Your back 
 I can hear You crying out 
 Father I desire that they would be 
 That they would be with me to see my glory 
 You took all my shame and my iniquity 
 For the sake of freedom You set me free 
 You made a way for me to enter the holy place 
 You made a way for me to enter the holy place 
 I am Yours, You are mine 
 And we'll be together forever

40 days to wander, 40 days to die to self 
 40 days to grow stronger as faith breaks open the gates of hell. 
 The Jubilee is over, but grace is far from gone 
 In the hearts of the faithful, broken on the wheels of love. 
 In the desert of temptation, lies the storm of true conversion, where springs of living water drown and refresh you And as the Jordan pours out change, your true self is all that remains, where springs of living water bind and break you. 
 40 days to remember the Paschal sacrifice 
 40 days to discover as passion calls us to new life 
 The Jubilee is over but mercy is far from gone 
 In the arms of the Father as the wayward child comes home. 
 In the desert of temptation, lies the storm of true conversion, where springs of living water drown and refresh you And as the Jordan pours out change, your true self is all that remains, where springs of living water bind and break you. 
 The Jubilee is over but mercy is far from gone.

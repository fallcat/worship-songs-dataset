God slow me down 
 I'm like a river running 
 Pressed to the ground 
 I feel it overcoming 
 I'm on my knees 
 I'm incomplete 
 This is a great unknown 
 Love is a long and narrow road 
 Come chase this heart of stone 
 I need a future not my own 
 Your spirit groans 
 Where all my words are ceasing 
 Can't do this alone 
 Lord help my unbelieving 
 My poverty 
 I'm incomplete 
 This is a great unknown 
 Love is a long and narrow road 
 Come chase this heart of stone 
 I need a future not my own 
 Not my own 
 We see the start but You see the end 
 We see in part but Your love sees everything 
 We plant the seeds but You make them grow 
 We're building a house, You're building a home 
 This is the great unknown 
 Love is a long and narrow road 
 Come chase this heart of stone 
 I need a future not my own 
 This world is not my home 
 I still have miles and miles to go 
 Come break this heart of stone 
 I need a future not my own

I have a home, eternal home 
 But for now I walk this broken world 
 You walked it first, You know our pain 
 But You show hope can rise again up from the grave 
 Abide with me, abide with me 
 Don't let me fall, and don't let go 
 Walk with me and never leave 
 Ever close, God abide with me 
 There in the night, Gethsemane 
 Before the cross, before the nails 
 Overwhelmed, alone You prayed 
 You met us in our suffering and bore our shame 
 Abide with me, abide with me 
 Don't let me fall, and don't let go 
 Walk with me and never leave 
 Ever close, God abide with me 
 Oh love that will not ever let me go 
 Love that will not ever let me go 
 You never let me go 
 Love that will not ever let me go 
 Oh You never let us go 
 And up ahead, eternity 
 We'll weep no more, we'll sing for joy, abide with me

Down in adoration falling, 
 This great sacrament we hail 
 Over ancient forms departing 
 Newer rites of grace prevail 
 Faith for all defects supplying 
 Where the feeble senses fail. 
 To the everlasting Father 
 And the Son who reigns on high, 
 With the Spirit blest, proceeding 
 Forth from each eternally, 
 Be salvation, honor, blessing, 
 Might and endless Majesty. 
 Jesus, Lamb of God, 
 Saving love for all, 
 Lord of heav'n and earth, 
 Father's love for all 
 I bow to you. 
 Jesus, Lamb of God, 
 Saving love for all, 
 Lord of heav'n and earth; 
 I bow to you, bow to you, I bow to you. 
 Pour upon us, Lord of mercy, 
 Spirit of thy selfless love. 
 Make of us one true heart yearning 
 For the glory of thy Son, 
 Jesus, fire of justice blazing, 
 Gladd'ning light forevermore. 
 Jesus, Lamb of God, 
 Saving love for all, 
 Lord of heav'n and earth, 
 Father's love for all 
 I bow to you. 
 Jesus, Lamb of God, 
 Saving love for all, 
 Lord of heav'n and earth; 
 I bow to you. 
 Jesus, Lamb of God, 
 Saving love for all, 
 Lord of heav'n and earth, 
 I bow to you. 
 Jesus, Lamb of God, 
 Saving love for all, 
 Lord of heav'n and earth; 
 I bow to you, bow to you, 
 Bow to you, bow to you, I bow to you.

I woke up in darkness surrounded by silence 
 Oh where, where have I gone? 
 I woke to reality losing its grip on me 
 Oh where, where have I gone? 
 'Cause I can see the light before I see the sunrise 
 You called and You shouted 
 Broke through my deafness 
 Now I'm breathing in and breathing out 
 I'm alive again 
 You shattered my darkness 
 Washed away my blindness 
 Now I'm breathing in and breathing out 
 I'm alive again 
 Late have I loved You 
 You waited for me 
 I searched for You 
 What took me so long? 
 I was looking outside 
 As if love would ever want to hide 
 I'm finding I was wrong 
 'Cause I could feel the wind before it hits my skin 
 You called and You shouted 
 Broke through my deafness 
 Now I'm breathing in and breathing out 
 I'm alive again 
 You shattered my darkness 
 Washed away my blindness 
 Now I'm breathing in and breathing out 
 I'm alive again, I'm alive again 
 'Cause I want You, yes, I want You, I need You 
 And I'll do whatever I have to just to get through 
 'Cause I love You, yeah, I love You 
 You called and You shouted 
 Broke through my deafness 
 Now I'm breathing in and breathing out 
 I'm alive again 
 You shattered my darkness 
 Washed away my blindness 
 Now I'm breathing in and breathing out 
 I'm alive again

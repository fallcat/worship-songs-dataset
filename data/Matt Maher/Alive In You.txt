It is you I seek in the night, 
 Waiting patiently to satisfy, 
 Not for human gain or worldly desire 
 But to lose myself in you forever. 
 Your blood runs in my veins; 
 My heart burns with your grace. 
 I'm alive in you as you live in me. 
 I'm alive in you, Hope of Glory. 
 You see through the veil into our hearts, 
 The deepest place that no one else knows, 
 Not for human gain or worldly desire 
 But to die with you and rise forever. 
 Your blood runs in my veins; 
 My heart burns with your grace. 
 I'm alive in you as you live in me. 
 I'm alive in you, Hope of Glory. 
 You will not be replaced. 
 You will not be replaced. 
 You will not be replaced, 
 Hope of Glory. 
 You will not be replaced. 
 You will not be replaced. 
 You will not be replaced, 
 Hope of Glory. 
 I'm alive in you as you live in me. 
 I'm alive in you, Hope of Glory. 
 I'm alive in you as you live in me. 
 I'm alive in you, Hope of Glory.

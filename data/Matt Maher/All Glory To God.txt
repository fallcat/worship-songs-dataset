Everything I say and do, 
 Everything I am to you, 
 Oh, I pray that you will know. 
 Whatever is good in me, 
 Wherever there's joy to see, 
 Hear me say it's not my own. 
 All glory to God, 
 All honor is his, 
 No other is worthy of his name. 
 All glory to God, 
 I'll always be his, 
 Forever I'll live to sing his praise. 
 Everyday I know I'm blessed 
 Just to know my heart, 
 It rests in his hands 
 That gave me life. 
 But you know I won't forget 
 What he's done for me, 
 You bet I'm amazed every time. 
 So I'm singing...

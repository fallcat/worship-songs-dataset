You are not alone if you are lonely 
 When you feel afraid, you're not the only 
 We are all the same, in need of mercy 
 To be forgiven and be free 
 It's all you got to lean on but thank God it's all you need 
 And all the people said Amen 
 And all the people said Amen 
 Give thanks to the Lord for His love never ends 
 At the top of your lungs sing it with me again 
 And all the people said Amen 
 Rich or poor it doesn't matter 
 Weak or strong, you know love is what we're after 
 We're all broken but we're all in this together 
 God knows we stumble and fall 
 And He so loved the world He sent His son to save us all 
 Blessed are the poor in Spirit who are torn apart 
 Blessed are the persecuted and the pure in heart 
 Blessed are the people hungry for another start 
 For theirs is the kingdom, the kingdom of God

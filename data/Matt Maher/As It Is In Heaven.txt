Our Father, who art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name 
 Come and let Your glory, 
 Come and let Your glory fall. 
 Our Father, who art in Heaven 
 The rocks cry out Your fame 
 Come and let Your glory, 
 Come and let Your glory fall. 
 I will sing, sing a new song 
 I will sing, sing a new song 
 I will sing, sing a new song to the Lord 
 Let your kingdom come 
 Let your will be done 
 On earth as it is in heaven

 The mercy of Your name 
 On earth as it is in heaven.

 Mercy his daily bread

 In the name of Jesus we pray 
 And lead us, not to temptation 
 But deliver us with Your hand 
 In the name of Jesus 
 In the name of Jesus we pray 
 Father we pray 
 I will sing, sing a new song 
 I will sing, sing a new song 
 I will sing, sing a new song to the Lord 
 Let your kingdom come 
 Let your will be done 
 On earth as it is in heaven 
 Every eye proclaim 
 The mercy of Your name 
 On earth as it is in heaven. 
 For the kingdom is yours 
 And the power is yours 
 And the glory forever Amen 
 For the kingdom is yours 
 And the power is yours 
 And the glory forever Amen 
 For the kingdom is yours

 And the glory forever Amen 
 For the kingdom is yours 
 And the power is yours 
 And the glory forever Amen

I believe in the Son 
 I believe in the risen One 
 I believe I overcome 
 By the power of His blood 
 Amen, Amen 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 Because He lives 
 Amen, Amen 
 Let my song join the one that never ends 
 Because He lives 
 I was dead in the grave 
 I was covered in sin and shame 
 I heard mercy call my name 
 He rolled the stone away 
 Amen, Amen 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 Because He lives 
 Amen, Amen 
 Let my song join the one that never ends 
 Because He lives 
 I can face tomorrow 
 Because He lives 
 Every fear is gone 
 I know He holds my life my future in His hands 
 Amen, Amen 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 Because He lives 
 Amen, Amen 
 Let my song join the one that never ends 
 Amen, Amen 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 Because He lives 
 Amen, Amen 
 Let my song join the one that never ends 
 Because He lives 
 Because He lives

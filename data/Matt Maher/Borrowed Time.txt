Where do you go from here 
 When love tears down the fortress 
 That you've made with all your fears 
 There are years of regret, of shame and condemnation 
 But God comes to you today to say 
 "Today is your salvation" 
 Well the clock is ticking 
 Are you gonna start living 
 'Cause you've really only got this life 
 And we're living on borrowed time 
 Don't you know what you've been given 
 So while the world's still spinning 
 Light a candle in your heart and shine 
 'Cause we're living on borrowed time 
 No one's getting out alive 
 But maybe life is how you live the days before you die 
 Do you have the strength to be empty-handed and forgiven 
 Can you hear the angels screaming, "Today is your salvation?" 
 Well the clock is ticking 
 Are you gonna start living 
 'Cause you've really only got this life 
 And we're living on borrowed time 
 Don't you know what you've been given 
 So while the world's still spinning 
 Light a candle in your heart and shine 
 'Cause we're living on borrowed time 
 We're living on borrowed time 
 Last night 
 Right now 
 Next week 
 Somehow 
 Love's the same 
 Love won't change 
 Love won't change 
 Love won't change 
 Well the clock is ticking 
 Are you gonna start living 
 'Cause you've really only got this life 
 And we're living on borrowed time 
 Don't you know what you've been given 
 So while the world's still spinning 
 Light a candle in your heart and shine 
 'Cause we're living on borrowed time 
 We're living on borrowed time 
 We're living on borrowed time 
 I'm giving you all of mine 
 And we're living on borrowed time 
 We're living on borrowed time 
 We're living on borrowed time 
 I'm giving back all of mine 
 As we're living on borrowed time

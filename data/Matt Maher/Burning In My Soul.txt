There is power, power 
 Here in this hour, this hour 
 We're all together, together 
 Waiting here as one 
 Whoa, hear the sound from heaven 
 Whoa, a mighty rushing wind 
 Whoa, we're calling for revival 
 God let your fire fall again 
 It's burning in my soul 
 Burning in my soul 
 All Your sons and Your daughters 
 Dreaming the dreams of their Father 
 Seeing the signs and the wonders 
 The Kingdom of God 
 Whoa, hear the sound from heaven 
 Whoa, a mighty rushing wind 
 Whoa, we're calling for revival 
 God let your fire fall again 
 It's burning in my soul 
 Burning in my soul 
 I cannot contain it 
 This fire inside 
 I cannot contain it 
 So let it shine 
 I cannot contain it 
 This light of mine 
 It's burning in my soul

The dawn breaks upon us with tender compassion 
 To shine in the darkness and we become your righteousness 
 Your promise of mercy, how made true on calvary 
 Our ransom has been paid and now we prepare the way 
 Declare victory! 
 You set us free! 
 For from you and through you and for you are all things 
 To you be all glory, all honour, all blessing 
 For from you and through you and for you are all things 
 To you be all glory, all honour, all blessing 
 From all sins and evil, from the snares of the devil 
 From your wrath, from our death, from a doubtful heart 
 That chokes on human breath 
 You deliver me! 
 You set us free! 
 For from you and through you and for you are all things 
 To you be all glory, all honour, all blessing 
 For from you and through you and for you are all things 
 To you be all glory, all honour, all blessing 
 Hallelujah

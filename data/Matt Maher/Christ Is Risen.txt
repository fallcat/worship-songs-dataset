Let no one caught in sin remain 
 Inside the lie of inward shame 
 We fix our eyes upon the cross 
 And run to Him who showed great love 
 And bled for us 
 Freely You've bled for us 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 Trampling over death by death 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 We are one with Him again 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 Beneath the weight of all our sin 
 You bowed to none but heaven's will 
 No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown 
 No burden great can hold You down 
 In strength You reign 
 Forever let Your church proclaim 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 Trampling over death by death 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 We are one with Him again 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 O death, where is your sting? 
 O hell, where is your victory? 
 O church, come stand in the light 
 The glory of God has defeated the night 
 Sing it, o death, where is your sting? 
 O hell, where is your victory? 
 O church, come stand in the light 
 Our God is not dead, He's alive, He's alive 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 Trampling over death by death 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 We are one with Him again 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 Trampling over death by death 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 Christ is risen from the dead 
 We are one with Him again 
 Come awake, come awake 
 Come and rise up from the grave 
 Rise up from the grave

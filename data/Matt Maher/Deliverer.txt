I was a drifter, I had nowhere to go 
 I was hanging by threads of dust and bone 
 Every angel I knew was singing son come home 
 But the melody was hard to sing along 
 Oh God, You're my deliverer 
 The One, the One who carries us 
 Oh God, You're my deliverer 
 I was on trial for everything I did 
 And there's no way I could make a stand and win 
 When you realize the verdict is already in 
 You let go of the brokenness within 
 Well there's only One who can ever stand and win 
 Oh God, You're my deliverer 
 The One, the One who carries us 
 Oh God, You're my deliverer 
 The One, the One who carries us 
 And now I'm like a child at night 
 Who never has to think of why 
 We're free to love and live and die 
 And there's no need to justify 
 The sinner that's inside of me 
 Has lost all his control of me 
 My God, from the flood and from the fire 
 You brought me out, I am alive 
 With a faith, just like a child 
 I'm not afraid, I'm running wild 
 For everything that will be done 
 I am yours and you are my 
 Deliverer 
 The One, the One who carries us 
 God, You're my deliverer 
 The One, the One who carries us 
 Oh God, You're my deliverer 
 The One, the One who carries us 
 Oh God, You're my deliverer 
 The One, the One who carries us 
 God, You're my deliverer 
 I was hanging by threads of dust and bone

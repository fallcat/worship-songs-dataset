From wanting to be loved 
 From wanting to be praised by all 
 From needing to be first 
 From finding all my worth in this world 
 From wanting to be seen 
 From constant worrying about myself 
 Deliver me 
 From validating words 
 That only seem to serve a heart that's proud 
 And oh, my self-esteem 
 Dressed up in vanity and doubt 
 From wondering if I am weller 
 Than the likes, oh God 
 Deliver me, deliver me 
 Show me what it all is like 
 Scribbled on the pages of a human life 
 We look through the ages 
 Do we see the light? +++ 
 Breakin' all the cages wide open 
 Every little prison, yeah +++ 
 From fear of letting go 
 From fear of the unknown ahead 
 I'm being overlooked 
 And so misunderstood again 
 From fear being judged 
 From the rumors of a love that fails 
 Deliver me, deliver me 
 Show me what it all is like 
 Scribbled on the pages of a human life 
 We look through the ages 
 Do we see the light? +++ 
 Breakin' all the cages wide open 
 Every little prison 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 Closer to that choose what I set aside +++ 
 Mostly have no sue 
 But when I fall on fire +++ 
 Breakin' on the cages wide open 
 All these little prison 
 Show me what it all is like 
 Scribbled on the pages of a human life 
 We look through the ages 
 Do we see the light? +++ 
 Breakin' on the cages wide open 
 Every little prison, yeah

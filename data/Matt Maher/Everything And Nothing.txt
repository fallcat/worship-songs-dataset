Come let us return to where we were 
 Back to knowing life and saving words 
 Back to where we heard redemption speak 
 Where You brought us to our knees 
 Come let us return to Eden's heart 
 Long before the fall, back to the start 
 Back before we covered up our sin 
 And took a second skin 
 Once upon a time 
 I'm lost and found 
 I'm saved and drowned 
 I'm everything and nothing all at once 
 I'm so far gone 
 But I'm already home 
 With everything and nothing but Your love 
 Come let us discover something new 
 'Cause we're all pilgrims on a journey to the truth 
 We're all wanderers relying on a man 
 To help us understand 
 Cause everybody wants to see the proof 
 We're always tripping on our pride to get to You 
 So blessed are the ones who haven't seen 
 But still believe 
 Once upon a time 
 I'm lost and found 
 I'm saved and drowned 
 I'm everything and nothing all at once 
 I'm so far gone 
 But I'm already home 
 With everything and nothing but Your love 
 My heart is tin but love is real 
 I'm unconvinced by what I feel 
 No yellow bricks to pave this road 
 Oh, straight and narrow lead me home 
 Lead me home 
 I'm lost and found 
 I'm saved and drowned 
 I'm everything and nothing all at once 
 Oh, I'm so far gone 
 But I'm already home 
 With everything and nothing but Your love 
 Everything and nothing 
 Everything and nothing 
 Everything and nothing but Your love 
 Nothing but Your love 
 Nothing but Your love

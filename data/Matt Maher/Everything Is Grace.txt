Your joy, when the morning comes 
 Your hope, keeps me looking up 
 You are enough 
 Your peace, the eye of every storm 
 Your strength, when my heart is worn 
 You are enough 
 Whatever comes my way 
 I will walk through the flames 
 You're turning my fear to faith 
 My doubt to praise 
 And everything is grace 
 Your love, when the wait is long 
 Your voice, keeps me holding on 
 You are enough 
 My delight, when bitterness comes close 
 My portion, the only thing I know 
 You are enough 
 Whatever comes my way 
 I will walk through the flames 
 You're turning my fear to faith 
 My doubt to praise 
 And everything is grace 
 True in the pouring rain 
 True in the crashing waves 
 It's true even in my pain, my heart can say 
 That everything is grace 
 Time after time, Your redemption is mine 
 Again and again, Your grace is everything 
 Time after time, Your redemption is mine 
 Again and again, Your grace is everything 
 You're turning my fear to faith 
 My doubt to praise 
 And everything is grace 
 True in the pouring rain 
 True in the crashing waves 
 He's true even in my pain, my heart can say 
 That everything is grace 
 Whoa, my heart can say 
 That everything is grace

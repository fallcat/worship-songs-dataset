Dear Jesus where are you tonight 
 I bear a sadness deep inside 
 I'm aching for a faith in things I strain to feel 
 I need to know that you are real 
 Oh Savior open up my eyes 
 I wanna see You like a child 
 There is a haze on the horizons of my heart 
 Dear Jesus show me where you are 
 Be my firelight, be my firelight 
 Burning fierce and bright, be my firelight 
 How do I move on and be free 
 From all these things that I have seen 
 All of my memories are turning into scars 
 Oh my God put back what's been torn apart 
 Be my firelight, be my firelight 
 Burning fierce and bright, be my firelight 
 If anyone remembers my name 
 If I'm ever known for anything 
 Let it be I ran into the night 
 Running with a firelight, firelight 
 'Cause I don't wanna stroll the streets of gold 
 While there's still a soul to love 
 Let me run into the night 
 Running with a firelight, firelight 
 Burning with a firelight, firelight

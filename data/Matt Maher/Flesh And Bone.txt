I met a man who walked on water 
 Who wore His crown like a blue collar 
 I met a man who treated children 
 Like they were ambassadors to the Kingdom 
 If I saw the world in Your eyes 
 Would it help me understand? 
 How You see through all our lies 
 Still You hold us in Your hand 
 I'm dying to believe 
 I'm trying just to show 
 That we're less than perfect 
 More than flesh and bone 
 People climbing trees to catch sight of You 
 Broken and blind searching for the truth 
 We're crippled by our fears and torments 
 Oh, Son of man, have pity on Your servants 
 If I saw the world in Your eyes 
 Would it help me understand? 
 How You see through all our lies 
 Still You hold us in Your hand 
 I'm dying to believe 
 I'm trying just to show 
 That we're less than perfect 
 More than flesh and bone 
 I wander and I want 
 Squander the riches of Your love 
 It's never enough for me 
 Oh, take this poverty and nail it to this tree 
 And all that's captive shall go free, I'm free 
 And if I saw the world in Your eyes 
 Would it help me understand? 
 That You see through all our lies 
 Still You hold us in Your hand 
 I'm dying to believe 
 I'm rising just to show 
 That we're less than perfect 
 Yeah, we're less than perfect 
 That we're less than perfect 
 More than flesh and bone

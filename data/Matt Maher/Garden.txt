In the cool of the day 
 You come and meet me 
 All the blue fades away 
 The stars are winking 
 Your love's so strong 
 I can't recall 
 What was this thing 
 They called the fall? 
 And You walk with me 
 You never leave 
 You're making my heart a garden 
 Oh, why would I hide 
 Away from Your face 
 When the light of Your love 
 Illuminates? 
 Your hand in mine 
 A steady line 
 Drawn on my heart 
 And deep in my mind 
 And You walk with me 
 You never leave 
 You're making my heart a garden 
 All the broken are mending 
 The mournful rejoicing 
 Seeing through tears 
 Of peace overflowing 
 And You walk with me 
 You never leave 
 You're making my heart a garden 
 Yeah, You walk with me 
 You never leave 
 You're making our world a garden

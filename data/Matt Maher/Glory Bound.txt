There is a train for the broken hearted 
 To carry you to the other side 
 There is a train for the ones forgotten 
 To carry you to a Heavenly light 
 Well I don't know which way you're going 
 And I don't know if you're lost or found 
 All that I know is you've been forgiven 
 I tell you this train is glory bound 
 There is a train for the cheats and liars 
 For all the hitchers looking for a ride 
 There is a train for the lonely drifter 
 Tired of walking all alone in the night 
 Well I don't know which way you're going 
 And I don't know if you're lost or found 
 All that I know is you've been forgiven 
 I tell you this train is glory bound 
 So come on make some room in your heart for mercy 
 Come on make some room for a little grace 
 Come on make some room for the sinners and the saints 
 Well I don't know which way you're going 
 And I don't know if you're lost or found 
 All that I know is you've been forgiven 
 I tell you this train is glory bound 
 And I can hear a band of angels 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
 All that I know is you've been forgiven 
 I tell you this train is glory bound 
 Glory bound, hey yeah 
 I tell you this train is glory bound

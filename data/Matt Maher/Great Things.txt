My soul proclaims Your greatness, Lord 
 Rejoicing in my Saviour 
 Your mercy belongs to those who fear Your Son 
 His blessings You have given them forever 
 And holy is His name, holy is His name 
 You alone have done great things 
 I can't boast of anything 
 Mighty one, and King of kings, Jesus 
 You alone have done great things 
 By Your living word in me 
 Mighty One, and King of kings, Jesus

Hark, the herald angels sing 
 Glory to the newborn King 
 Peace on earth and mercy mild 
 God and sinners reconciled 
 Joyful, all ye nations rise 
 Join the triumph of the skies 
 With the angelic host proclaim 
 Christ is born in Bethlehem 
 Hark, the herald angels sing 
 Glory to the newborn King 
 Christ by highest heaven adored 
 Christ, the everlasting Lord 
 Late in time, behold Him come 
 Offspring of a Virgin's womb 
 Veiled in flesh the Godhead see 
 Hail the incarnate Deity 
 Pleased as man with man to dwell 
 Jesus, our Emmanuel 
 Hark, the herald angels sing 
 Glory to the newborn King 
 Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace 
 Hail the Son of Righteousness 
 Light and life to all He brings 
 Risen with healing in His wings 
 Mild He lays His glory by 
 Born that man no more may die 
 Born to raise the sons of earth 
 Born to give them second birth 
 Hark, the herald angels sing 
 Glory to the newborn King

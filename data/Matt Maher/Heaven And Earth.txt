Close my eyes, let the static go away 
 Shine Your light as the dawn begins to fade 
 Am I living with my heart broken and battered 
 Drowning out the sound of my own aching soul 
 I'm just trying to find a home 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 Oh, You're all I need, You're all I need 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 You're the love in between, the love in between 
 Between Heaven, Heaven and Earth 
 Am I here, just a drifter on my own 
 Hanging out on a world that's not my home 
 'Cause if I'm left alone to my own devices 
 I'm plotting out the end with all my vices 
 Please come and rescue me 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 Oh, You're all I need, You're all I need 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 You're the love in between, the love in between 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 Oh, You're all I need, You're all I need 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 You're the love in between, the love in between 
 When You look down, show me what You see 
 More than good intentions and failing dreams 
 A billion lives all worlds apart 
 A billion voices crying out 
 They're reaching out for the light of day 
 But there's only one way, there's only one way 
 There's only one way 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 Oh, You're all I need, You're all I need 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 You're the love in between, the love in between 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 Oh, You're all I need, You're all I need 
 Between Heaven and Earth 
 You're the love in between, the love in between

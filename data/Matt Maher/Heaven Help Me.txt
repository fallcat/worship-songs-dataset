I don't wanna live tomorrow 
 For another rainy day 
 I don't wanna say I'm sorry 
 If I can avoid the pain 
 I don't wanna gain the whole world 
 Just a turn and lose it all 
 'Cause when it's time to jump I don't wanna guess 
 If you're gonna help break the wall 
 Is there any hope for help? 
 Heaven help me now 
 Heaven help me now 
 I lift You up and I lay back down 
 Heaven help me now 
 I don't wanna sing You praises 
 Just to hear them on the radio 
 I don't wanna sing for justice 
 If I'm not among the poor 
 I don't wanna claim I know You 
 If Your name's not on my heart 
 'Cause when it's time to go I don't wanna look back 
 Just to see I was playing a part 
 Is there any hope for help? 
 Heaven help me now 
 Heaven help me now 
 I lift You up and I lay back down 
 Heaven help me now 
 Heaven help me now, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Heaven help me now, yeah, yeah 
 I believe You can help me now 
 I believe You can help me now 
 Everybody's pulling the Bible 
 Like it could be (Incomprehensible) 
 And You're standing on the corner 
 With the saints and the sinners 
 Tryin' to (Incomprehensible) Your love with my life 
 Heaven help me now 
 Heaven help me now 
 I lift You up and I lay back down 
 Heaven help me now 
 Heaven help me now, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Heaven help me now, yeah, yeah 
 Oh, heaven help me now

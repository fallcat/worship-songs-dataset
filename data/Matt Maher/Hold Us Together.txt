It don't have a job, don't pay your bills 
 Won't buy you a home in Beverly Hills 
 Won't fix your life in five easy steps 
 Ain't the law of the land or the government 
 But it's all you need 
 And love will hold us together 
 Make us a shelter to weather the storm 
 And I'll be my brother's keeper 
 So the whole world will know that we're not alone 
 It's waiting for you knocking at your door 
 In the moment of truth when your heart hits the floor 
 And you're on your knees 
 And love will hold us together 
 Make us a shelter to weather the storm 
 And I'll be my brother's keeper 
 So the whole world will know that we're not alone 
 This is the first day of the rest of your life 
 This is the first day of the rest of your life 
 'Cause even in the dark, you can still see the light 
 It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright 
 This is the first day of the rest of your life 
 This is the first day of the rest of your life 
 'Cause even in the dark, you can still see the light 
 It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright 
 Love will hold us together 
 Make us a shelter to weather the storm 
 And I'll be my brother's keeper 
 So the whole world will know that we're not alone

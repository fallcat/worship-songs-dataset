I love you, Lord. 
 I love you, Lord. 
 I love you, Lord; 
 You are my strength. 
 My heart, it longs to be with you 
 And nothing else will ever do. 
 So at your throne is where I'll be, 
 Where your flesh and blood consumes me 
 And I am one with you. 
 My stronghold, my refuge, 
 Your righteousness will see me through. 
 In dark of night and thorn of sin 
 I will stay close to you, my friend, 
 And I am one with you.

Underneath the shadow 
 Underneath the shadow 
 Underneath the shadow of Your ways 
 Lord and King 
 Cover me 
 I rejoice, I rejoice, I rejoice, I rejoice 
 In You, in You I rejoice in You 
 In You, in You I rejoice in You 
 Underneath the shadow 
 Underneath the shadow 
 Underneath the shadow of the the Cross 
 You bore the cost 
 And Death is lost 
 I rejoice, I rejoice, I rejoice, I rejoice 
 In You, in You I rejoice in You 
 In You, in You, I rejoice in You 
 Your arms spread out like eagle's wings 
 His love lays out a wedding feast 
 Your body and your blood 
 And now we have become 
 Your sons and your daughters 
 In You, in You, I rejoice in You 
 In You, in You, I rejoice in You

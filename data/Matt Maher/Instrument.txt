Where there is hatred Lord, let me sow your love 
 Where there's injury, let forgiveness be enough 
 Are we giving up, fighting the good fight 
 Where there is despair, just a flicker in the flame 
 Could break the veil of night 
 To the Father and the Son 
 And the Holy Spirit, three in One 
 I offer you myself, though I'm broken and spent 
 Let me be Your instrument 
 Let me be Your instrument 
 May I never seek, to be consoled as to console 
 May I understand, to be loved is to love, to be loved is to love 
 To the Father and the Son 
 And the Holy Spirit, three in One 
 I offer you myself, though I'm broken and spent 
 Let me be Your instrument 
 Let me be Your instrument 
 Halleluiah 
 Oh praise Him, Halleluiah 
 I offer you myself, though I'm broken and spent 
 Let me be Your instrument 
 Let there be peace, pardoned in the pardoning 
 Born again when we die, You have raised us to new life 
 Let there be peace, pardoned in the pardoning 
 Born again when we die, You have raised us to new life

The spirit of the Lord God is upon me 
 Because the Lord has anointed me. 
 He has sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor, 
 To heal the brokenhearted, 
 To proclaim liberty to the captives 
 And release to the prisoners, 
 To announce a year of favor from the Lord 
 And a day of vindication by our God, 
 And a day of vindication by our God. 
 So will the Lord God let justice and praise, 
 Justice and praise, justice and praise, 
 So will the Lord God let justice and praise 
 Spring up before all the nations. 
 I rejoice heartily in the Lord; 
 In the Lord is the joy of my soul. 
 For he has clothed me with a robe of salvation 
 And wrapped me in a mantle of justice, 
 Like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem, 
 Like a bride bedecked with her jewels. 
 As the earth springs forth its plants 
 And a garden makes its growth spring up, 
 And a garden makes its growth spring up.

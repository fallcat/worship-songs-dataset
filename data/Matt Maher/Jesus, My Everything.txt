I've been looking for a reason... 
 I've been longing for a purpose... 
 I'm losing all my meaning... 
 I've run out of excuses. 
 Lord, it's hard to know You. 
 I don't always see your plan 
 But holiness is calling me 
 So take me as I am. 
 You are my everything, 
 You are the song I sing; 
 I'll do anything for you 
 Teach me how to pray, 
 To live a life of grace; 
 I'll go anywhere with you 
 Jesus, be my everything. 
 Lord, I get so tired of the struggle within 
 I settle in complacency and I'm weighed down in my sin 
 So lead me past emotion, 
 'Cause they changed with the wind 
 I want to be a true disciple 
 To daily choose Your hand.

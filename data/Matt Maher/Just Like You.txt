Revive my heart, renew my soul 
 In You, oh Lord, I am made whole 
 No more in fear will I wander 
 'Cause you're my God 
 My Lord and Lover 
 Like a burning fire 
 Be my one desire 
 I wanna be holy, just like You 
 I wanna go where You lead me to 
 With reckless abandon to Your truth 
 I wanna fall deeper in love with You 
 Oh lift me up, God my Father 
 In all this world, there is no other 
 I'm dancing in Your holy presence 
 And Your glory fills all my senses 
 Like a burning fire 
 Be my one desire 
 I wanna be holy, just like You 
 I wanna go where You lead me to 
 With reckless abandon to Your truth 
 I wanna fall deeper in love with You 
 I wanna be holy, just like You 
 I wanna go where You lead me to 
 With reckless abandon to Your truth 
 I wanna fall deeper in love with You 
 I wanna be holy, just like You 
 I wanna go where You lead me to 
 With reckless abandon to Your truth 
 I wanna fall deeper in love with You 
 And deeper, and deeper, and deeper 
 And deeper in love with You 
 And deeper, and deeper, and deeper 
 And deeper in love with you 
 And deeper, and deeper, and deeper 
 And deeper in love with You 
 I wanna be holy 
 I wanna be holy 
 I wanna be holy 
 I wanna be holy

There's a sweetness in Your presence 
 All Your children running home 
 Singing songs of exultation 
 Lifting up Your name 
 In the land of my Father, oh my soul will sing 
 Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty 
 We sing Holy, Holy, my eyes have seen the glory 
 Of the great God Almighty 
 There's a patience in Your Spirit 
 Waiting for that day to come 
 Peace beyond all understanding 
 Never-ending joy 
 In the land of my Father, oh my soul will sing 
 Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty 
 We sing Holy, Holy, my eyes have seen the glory 
 Of the great God Almighty 
 God Your goodness, I have tasted 
 Jesus I have seen 
 Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty 
 We sing Holy, Holy, my eyes have seen the glory 
 Of the great God Almighty

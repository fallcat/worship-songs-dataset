Everything I am, everything I long to be 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 Everything I am, everything I long to be 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 I lay it down, I lay it down 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 I lay it down, I lay it down 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 Everything I am, everything I long to be 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 Everything I am, everything I long to be 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 I lay it down, I lay it down 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 I lay it down, I lay it down 
 I lay it down 
 Oh, Pearl of greatest price 
 No act of sacrifice 
 Can match the gift of life 
 I find within Your gaze 
 Oh, what a sweet exchange 
 I die to rise again 
 Lifted up from the grave 
 Into Your hands of grace 
 Oh, Pearl of greatest price 
 No act of sacrifice 
 Can match the gift of life 
 I find within Your gaze 
 Oh, what a sweet exchange 
 I die to rise again 
 Lifted up from the grave 
 Into Your hands of grace 
 I lay it down, I lay it down 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 I lay it down, I lay it down 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 I lay it down, I lay it down 
 I lay it down at Your feet 
 I lay it down, lay it down 
 Lay it down at Your feet

Thank You for the cross 
 Thank You for Your love 
 The perfect sacrifice 
 Of praise to God above 
 Thank You for the gift 
 Thank You for the price 
 Of losing everything 
 To gain eternal life 
 Thank You 
 Thank You 
 Thank You 
 Thank You for Your joy 
 Thank You for the pain 
 Of longing for peace 
 In my suffering 
 Thank You for my hunger 
 For my poverty 
 So I would fall into the arms of mercy 
 Every road leads back to You 
 Every journey lies in You, so 
 Lead me home my lover, savior (lead me home) 
 Lead me home my master, redeamer (lead me home) 
 Lead me home and I will rest in You 
 I praise You when I'm broken 
 I praise You when I'm lost 
 That it would keep me honest 
 In need of You alone 
 I praise You for the past 
 For the mess of sin 
 I would never want 
 To turn from You again 
 Every road leads back to You 
 Every journey lies in You, so 
 Lead me home (lead me home, lead me home) 
 Lead me home (lead me home, lead me home) 
 Lead me home (lead me home, lead me home) 
 Every road leads back to You 
 Every journey lies in You, so 
 Lead me home and I will rest in You 
 Lead me home and I will rest in You (Jesus lead me home) 
 I will rest in You (Lead me home I will rest in You, I will rest in You)

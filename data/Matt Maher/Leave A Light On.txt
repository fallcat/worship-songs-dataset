Where did you go? 
 Jesus, where did you go? 
 You flew into the clouds 
 We worship and we doubt 
 Now we're leaping for joy and singing 
 So where are you now? 
 Tell me where are you now 
 Headed in the skies 
 Behind the poor man's eyes 
 Awaited and asserted 
 Until you take us home 
 Until you return 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 Your Spirit inside, burning bright 
 I'll leave a light on 
 Here you are found 
 Jesus, here you are found 
 In the breaking of the bread 
 The waking of the dead 
 In our dying and our rising 
 Until you take us home 
 Until you return 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 Your Spirit inside, burning bright 
 I'll leave a light on 
 Give me oil in my lamp 
 Keep me burning till the break of day 
 Give me oil in my lamp 
 Keep it burning till the break of day 
 Give me oil in my lamp 
 Give me oil in my lamp 
 Keep me burning till the break of day 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 Your Spirit inside, burning bright 
 I'll leave a light on 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord 
 Your Spirit inside, burning bright 
 I'll leave a light on 
 I'll leave a light on 
 (Shine on through the darkness) 
 I'll leave a light on 
 (Shine on, shine on)

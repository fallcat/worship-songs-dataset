I stand in awe of You 
 And everything You've done for me 
 You speak Your words into my life 
 And where You are is where I wanna be 
 I stand before You, Lord 
 Humbled by the love You give away 
 A widow's mite, my will and pride 
 It's all I have to offer anyway 
 I'm holding onto Your love 
 I'm letting go of myself 
 I'll say so long to everything else 
 I stand in awe of You 
 And everything You've done for me 
 You speak Your words into my life 
 And where You are is where I wanna be 
 I stand before You, Lord 
 Humbled by the love You give away 
 A widow's mite, my will and pride 
 It's all I have to offer anyway 
 I'm holding onto Your love 
 I'm letting go of myself 
 I'm holding onto Your love 
 I'm letting go of myself 
 I'll say so long to everything else 
 I just wanna be in Your arms 
 I just wanna be in Your arms 
 Moving ever closer to Your heart 
 To Your heart 
 I just wanna be in Your arms 
 I just wanna be in Your arms 
 Moving ever closer to Your heart 
 To Your heart 
 I just wanna be in Your arms 
 I just wanna be in Your arms 
 Moving ever closer to Your heart 
 To Your heart

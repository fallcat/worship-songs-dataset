All God's creatures got a place in the choir 
 Some sing low and some sing higher. 
 Some just sing out like a bird on a wire 
 Waiting to fly home. 
 All God's children are the apple of His eye 
 Even the ones we can't stand sometimes. 
 But because you care just to go outside 
 And I need something to sing with this neighbour of mine 
 That's why grace is so amazing 
 That's why love is so absurd 
 That's why I sing for a god unchanging 
 That's why I don't care if I look like a fool 
 All God's people got a reason to live 
 Joy for the hard days and true love to give 
 So we raise our hands and lay down sin 
 And remember the days our freedom began 
 That's why grace is so amazing 
 That's why love is so absurd 
 That's why I sing for a God unchanging 
 That's why I don't care if I look like a fool 
 His grace is so amazing 
 That's why love is so absurd 
 That's why I sing for a God unchanging 
 That's why I don't care if I look like a fool. 
 Yeah I look like a fool 
 Feeding the hungry 
 Clothing the naked 
 Giving the homeless a place to rest 
 Visiting the prisoner 
 Lifting up the lowly 
 By your fruits 
 May you shine on us 
 May you shine on us 
 Shine on us 
 Oh shine on us 
 That's why grace is so amazing 
 That's why love is so absurd 
 That's why I sing for a God unchanging 
 That's why I don't care if I look like a fool. 
 His grace is so amazing 
 That's why love is so absurd 
 That's why I sing for a God unchanging 
 That's why I don't care if I look like a fool

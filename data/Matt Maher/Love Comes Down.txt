I'm searching for a king and kingdom 
 Here among the beggars and the weak 
 The broken and redeemed 
 I'm finding grace beyond all measure 
 In flesh and blood He hides His majesty 
 Inside of you and me 
 Why would a King do such a thing? 
 Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it marvelous? 
 The God of the universe, He became one of us 
 We cry out and then love comes down again 
 Faith is found in Him, Hallelujah 
 Oh, glorious beyond all measure 
 Bending low to wash His traitor's feet 
 People just like me 
 Why would a king do such a thing? 
 Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it marvelous? 
 The God of the universe, He became one of us 
 We cry out and then love comes down again 
 Hope is found in Him, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 So sing, sing for faith, sing for hope 
 Sing for what great love has done 
 What was lost He has found 
 Shout it out, oh 
 Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it marvelous? 
 The God of the universe, He became one of us 
 We cry out and then love comes down again 
 Glory is found in Him, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, so we're singing

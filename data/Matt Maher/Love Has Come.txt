With one voice the Angels sing 
 Songs that make creation ring 
 Prophets hear and call us 
 To live in spirit and in truth 
 Father Yahweh, Elohim 
 Voice of thunder, spirit wind 
 Breathe on me your very life 
 Grace will make the darkness bright 
 Word of God enthroned 
 Dwell in us forevermore 
 Love has come to show the way 
 Halleluiah, peace be with us 
 Love has come to show the way 
 God of covenant divine 
 Lead us to the end of time 
 Beyond sorrow, beyond fear 
 Beyond pride and earthen tears 
 Word of God enthroned 
 Dwell in us forevermore 
 Love has come to show the way 
 Halleluiah, peace be with us 
 Love has come to show the way 
 Keeper of the sacrifice 
 Manifest in Jesus Christ 
 Born to die and wake the dead 
 As we hunger, keep us fed 
 Now salvation has come 
 In the New Jerusalem 
 Dancers dance and singers roar 
 Proclaiming Jesus Christ is Lord 
 Word of God enthroned 
 Dwell in us forevermore 
 Love has come to show the way 
 Halleluiah, peace be with us 
 Love has come to show the way 
 Word of God enthroned 
 Dwell in us forevermore 
 Love has come to show the way 
 Halleluiah, peace be with us 
 Love has come to show the way

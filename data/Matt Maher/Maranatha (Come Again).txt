Come let us go to the house of the Lord 
 The Kingdom of God and the city of man 
 A place for all races a place where Your grace is 
 Dwell in our hearts in the works of our hands 
 Come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands 
 And now we see eyes in the mirror 
 Reflections of You of what is to come 
 A glorious cloud a beauty profound 
 In the widow, the orphan, the lame and the poor 
 Come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands 
 Come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands 
 We are a broken world oh Lord 
 Made worthy for the call to love 
 We're healed by grace through faith in You 
 A people truly set apart 
 We are a broken world oh Lord 
 Unworthy to be set apart 
 We die unto our selfish ways 
 And go unto Your sacred heart 
 Come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands 
 Come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands

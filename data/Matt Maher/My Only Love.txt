I still want you, yes, I need you 
 And I wanna hold you after all these years 
 I will listen to your problems 
 Won't try to fix it, just wipe away your tears 
 If you need me in the middle of the night, my dear 
 I'll stay awake till morning light 
 And change the way you feel 
 So come closer right here forever 
 Deep in my heartbeat together as one 
 My only love 
 If you need me in the middle of the night, my dear 
 I'll stay awake till morning light 
 And change the way you feel 
 So come closer right here forever 
 Deep in my heartbeat together as one 
 My only love, my only heart 
 My only lover, oh, oh

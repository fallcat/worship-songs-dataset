She's a lot like grace, she's a lot like grace 
 I can't live without her and when I'm with her 
 The world, it looks like a better place 
 She's a lot like grace, she's a lot like grace 
 (Incomprehensible) all over my funny little self 
 She completes me anyways 
 Hold my heart into the light 
 Next to you I'm more than all right 
 I got nothing left to hide 
 I'm walkin' around in a new state of mind 
 She's a lot like mercy, she's a lot like mercy 
 Gettin' more than you deserve 
 When your fortune isn't earned 
 She forgives me before I say sorry 
 Hold my heart into the light 
 Next to you I'm more than all right 
 I got nothing left to hide 
 I'm walkin' around in a new state of mind 
 This is a mystery 'cause you love me 
 For the rest of my life all the way eternally 
 Yeah, this is a mystery 'cause you love me 
 I'll give you everything on the way to eternity 
 Hold my heart into the light 
 Next to you I'm more than all right 
 I got nothing left to hide 
 I'm walkin' around in a new state of mind 
 Yes, hold my heart into the light 
 Next to you I'm more than all right 
 I got nothing left to hide 
 Now I'm walkin' around in a new state of mind 
 I'm walkin' around in a new state of mind

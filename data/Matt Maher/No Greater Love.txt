For the city, for the world we pray 
 Let Your light shine down 
 Come around and live in us 
 For the close and the far away 
 Everywhere You are 
 Everywhere 
 And we lift high the banner of the cross 
 There is no greater love than this, no love but this 
 Jesus Christ laid down His life for us 
 There is no greater love than His, no love but His 
 To the city, to the world we go 
 Set us free, heal the land 
 You have promised, God, You can 
 To the last and the least we go 
 Everywhere You are 
 Everywhere 
 And we lift high the banner of the cross 
 There is no greater love than this, no love but this 
 Jesus Christ laid down His life for us 
 There is no greater love than His, no love but His 
 In the poor, in the broken 
 In the crowded city streets 
 In the towers, in the money 
 In the strong and in the weak 
 In the orphans and the widows 
 In the churches and the bars 
 You are everywhere 
 God, You are everywhere 
 And we lift high the banner of the cross 
 There is no greater love than this, no love but this 
 Jesus Christ laid down His life for us 
 There is no greater love than His, no love but His

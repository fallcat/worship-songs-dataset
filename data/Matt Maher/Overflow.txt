1. Your grace is power, your will forever, 
 Your love is a river; overflow in me. 
 2. Your word: true presence. Your body: our recompense. 
 Your blood: salvation; overflow in me. 
 Overflow in me, my Lord, overflow in me, my Lord. 
 Let your people bless you as your cup is poured; 
 Overflow in me, my Lord, overflow in me, my Lord. 
 3. Your worship of you, it's your gift to us from you. 
 No one could give this gift but you; overflow in me. 
 We lift up our hearts. We lift up our souls. 
 We lift up our minds. Every good thing is yours. 
 Yeah, every good thing is yours, so overflow. Oh, 
 Final Refrain 
 Overflow in me, my Lord, overflow in me, my Lord. 
 Let your people bless you as your cup is poured; 
 Overflow in me, my Lord, overflow in me, my Lord. 
 Overflow in me, my Lord. Overflow. Oh. 
 Overflow in me, my Lord. Overflow in me, my Lord. 
 Overflow in me, my Lord.

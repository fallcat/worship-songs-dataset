Oh, how could it be 
 That my God would welcome me into this mystery 
 Say take this bread, take this wine 
 Now the simple made divine for any to receive 
 By Your mercy, we come to Your table 
 By Your grace, You are making us faithful 
 Lord, we remember You 
 And remembrance leads us to worship 
 And as we worship You 
 Our worship leads to communion 
 We respond to Your invitation, we remember You 
 See His body, His blood 
 Know that He has overcome every trial we will face 
 None too lost to be saved 
 None too broken or ashamed, all are welcome in this place 
 By Your mercy, we come to Your table 
 By Your grace, You are making us faithful 
 Lord, we remember You 
 And remembrance leads us to worship 
 And as we worship You 
 Our worship leads to communion 
 We respond to Your invitation, we remember You 
 Dying You destroyed our death 
 Rising You restored our life 
 Lord Jesus, come in glory 
 Lord Jesus, come in glory 
 Lord Jesus, come in glory 
 Lord Jesus, come in glory 
 Lord, we remember You 
 And remembrance leads us to worship 
 And as we worship You 
 Our worship leads to communion 
 We respond to Your invitation 
 We respond to Your invitation, we remember You

Oh my Lord, You are my shepherd and I shall not want 
 Oh my Lord, beside still waters You repair my heart 
 I trust in You, oh I trust in You 
 Even though I walk through the valley of death 
 You restore my soul and You give me rest 
 All the memories of Your faithfulness 
 You restore my soul and You give me rest 
 You restore my soul and You give me rest 
 You give me rest 
 Oh my Lord, You prepare a table for You and me 
 Oh my Lord, in the middle of a fight with my enemies 
 I trust in You, Oh I trust in You 
 I will fear no evil for You're here with me 
 Your goodness and Your love, they will never leave 
 Just a closer walk with Thee, just a closer walk

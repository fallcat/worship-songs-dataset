It's the weight of your glory; 
 Brings the proud to their knees. 
 And the light of revelation lets the blind man see. 
 It's the power of the cross; 
 Breaks away death's embrace. 
 And we celebrate our freedom, 
 Dancing on an empty grave. 
 Roll away the stone ... roll away the stone ... 
 We sing for joy, we shout your name. 
 We celebrate your resurrection day. 
 Sing for joy we shout your name. 
 We celebrate your resurrection day. 
 You declare what is holy; 
 You declare what is good. 
 In the sight of all the nations 
 You declare that you are God. 
 It's the power of your blood; 
 Breaks away sin's embrace. 
 And we celebrate our freedom 
 Dancing on our broken chains.

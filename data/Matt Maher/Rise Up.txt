When you see the road ahead 
 That you've been down before 
 When you're half way to nowhere 
 And you can't pay the toll 
 To hangin' on to mercy 
 Whithered on the (Incomprehensible) 
 With your feet on the ground 
 Your head in the clouds 
 And your heart on the line 
 Open up your eyes 
 You got to rise up, rise up 
 When this life has got you down 
 You got to look up, look up 
 When you search and nothing's found 
 But I just see the glory of the love that's here 
 And now it's coming down 
 So rise up now, yeah, yeah 
 When you (Incomprehensible) goes down 
 And your mind keeps on (Incomprehensible) 
 At the dreams that don't come around 
 When you don't know how to surrender 
 'Cause your whole life's been a fight 
 When the dark comes to you 
 And you can't break through 
 'Cause you haven't seen the light 
 Open up your eyes 
 You got to rise up, rise up 
 When this life has got you down 
 You got to look up, look up 
 When you search and nothing's found 
 But I just see the glory of the love thet's here 
 And now it's coming down 
 So rise up now, yeah, rise up now 
 Oh, rise up now 
 And all the lambs roar like lions 
 And all the prisoners breaking their chains 
 And all the poor find their treasures 
 'Cause heaven comin' this way 
 And all the lambs roar like lions 
 And all the prisoners breaking their chains 
 And all the poor find their treasures 
 'Cause heaven comin' this way 
 Rise up, rise up 
 When this life has got you down 
 You got to look up, look up 
 When you search and nothing's found 
 But I just see the glory of the love thet's here 
 And now it's coming down 
 So rise up now, yeah, rise up now 
 Oh, rise up now, yeah, yeah

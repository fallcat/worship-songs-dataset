Set me as a seal on your heart 
 Set me as a seal on your soul 
 As strong as death is love 
 Unyielding as the grave 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 Set me as a seal on your heart 
 Set me as a seal on your soul 
 As strong as death is love 
 Unyielding as the grave 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 Kiss me, my love 
 That your name be on my lips 
 You intoxicate my being 
 With the fragrance of your presence 
 How beautiful you are, my darling 
 Show me your face, let me hear your voice 
 Sweet as the dew in the early morn' 
 Like a lily among the thorns 
 Set me as a seal on your heart 
 Set me as a seal on your soul 
 As strong as death is love 
 Unyielding as the grave 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 I looked for you, the one my heart loves 
 I looked for you but did not find you 
 Searched through the night 
 Until I rested in your sight 
 Now I will never let you go 
 'Cause you have stolen my heart 
 My sister, my bride 
 You've stolen my heart 
 With one glance of your eyes 
 Your lips so sweet, adorned with honey 
 My hands, they drip with myrrh 
 Set me as a seal on your heart 
 Set me as a seal on your soul 
 As strong as death is love 
 Unyielding as the grave 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 Nothing will quench its flame 
 Nothing will quench its flame

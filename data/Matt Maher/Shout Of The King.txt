You're not like man that You should lie 
 You do not falter or change Your mind 
 All that You say is what You do 
 All that You've promised You're seeing through 
 So we wait on You, Lord 
 And we rise to Your voice 
 The shout of the King, the son of God 
 Your presence now here with us 
 The sound of praise all in a name 
 Jesus Christ, the one who saves 
 All you people rise to the shout of the King 
 There is no power, no scheme of man 
 That separates us from Your hand 
 We will not move far from Your gaze 
 Here in Your presence we will remain 
 So we stand on Your word 
 And we run to Your voice 
 The shout of the King, the son of God 
 Your presence now here with us 
 The sound of praise all in a name 
 Jesus Christ, the one who saves 
 The shout of the King, the son of God 
 Your presence now here with us 
 The sound of praise all in a name 
 Jesus Christ, the one who saves 
 It's the sound that breaks down strongholds 
 It's the sound that makes a sinner whole 
 It's the sound of freedom falling on the earth 
 The sound of victory 
 The shout of the King, the son of God 
 Your presence now here with us 
 The sound of praise all in a name 
 Jesus Christ, the one who saves 
 The shout of the King, the son of God 
 Your presence now here with us 
 The sound of praise all in a name 
 Jesus Christ, the one who saves 
 All you people rise, all you people rise 
 To the shout of the King, to the shout of the King

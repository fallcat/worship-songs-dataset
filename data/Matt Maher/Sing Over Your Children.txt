I flirt with the world 
 It steals my love for You 
 My fear grips my faith 
 And I am left unmoved 
 Your gaze stops my heart 
 Your voice fills the dark 
 Your love is the spark that lights this life 
 So we rise 
 Out of the depths you cry 
 Come and be satisfied 
 Father, You sing 
 Father, You sing over Your children 
 You quiet the storm 
 Inside my shipwrecked soul 
 Your spirit will lead 
 It calls the wayward home 
 At the sound of Your name 
 Our sin is washed away 
 In Christ we're crucified 
 In You we die, in You we rise 
 Out of the depths you cry 
 Come and be satisfied 
 Father, You sing 
 Father, You sing over Your children 
 Let us see through Your eyes 
 We are Your great delight 
 Father You sing 
 Father, You sing over Your children 
 And we're singing along 
 Your daughters and sons 
 We're singing Your song 
 We are Your children 
 Out of the depths you cry 
 Come and be satisfied 
 Father, You sing 
 Father, You sing over Your children 
 Let us see through Your eyes 
 We are Your great delight 
 Father, You sing 
 Father, You sing over Your children

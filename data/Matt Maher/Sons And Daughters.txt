How free is anyone, when some are still in chains 
 Slaves to brokenness, all this blindness 
 How free is anyone, when all these doubts remain 
 In the dead of night, no sign of the light 
 Child don't grow weary, soon we will see the sun 
 All my brothers help each other 
 All my sisters walk together 
 No one is a stranger 
 We're all sons and daughters 
 Join hands with everyone, don't you hear the song we sing 
 Oh there might be tears, but we are more than our fears 
 We are marching on, but there's a price we have to pay 
 For love means taking on, the weight of what was won 
 Child don't grow weary, soon we will see the sun 
 All my brothers help each other 
 All my sisters walk together 
 No one is a stranger 
 We're all sons and daughters 
 Help each other 
 All my sisters walk together 
 No one is a stranger 
 We're all sons and daughters 
 We shall overcome, we shall overcome 
 The victory is won, oh we shall overcome 
 We shall overcome, we shall overcome 
 The victory is won, oh we shall overcome 
 All my brothers help each other 
 All my sisters walk together 
 No one is a stranger 
 We're all sons and daughters 
 Help each other 
 All my sisters walk together 
 No one is a stranger 
 We're all sons and daughters

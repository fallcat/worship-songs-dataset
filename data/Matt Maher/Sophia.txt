She's so, you know 
 Makes me want to be like Jesus 
 I am your hands 
 Tell me what your plan for this is 
 In your sacred heart, I burn for you 
 Could I burn with her in a flame of truth 
 Where all my burdens float like an angel feather? 
 Sophia, you know me 
 Sophia, you see through me 
 Sophia, dance with me 
 Help me make it through the night 
 Dark night, so bright 
 Now I see the way of passion 
 Let go, my soul 
 Now it only longs for your affection 
 In your sacred heart, I dwell with you 
 Could I dwell with her like the angels do 
 Where all my burdens float like an angel feather 
 Sophia, you know me 
 Sophia, you see through me 
 Sophia, dance with me 
 Help me make it through the night 
 Help me make it through the night 
 Help me make it through the night 
 Sophia, Sophia 
 Sophia, Sophia 
 Sophia, Sophia 
 Sophia, Sophia 
 Sophia, Sophia

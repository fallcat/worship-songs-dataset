(Talking) If everything that the Roman Catholic Church 
 Taught were true, what difference would it make in our lives 
 We believe that in every single mass, 
 Through the power of the Holy Spirit, 
 That the bread and the wine are transformed 
 Into the flesh and the blood of Jesus 
 Transubstantiation 
 Heaven kisses earth 
 We become a living tabernacle 
 So wisdom, be attentive 
 Steady my shaken mind 
 Let this be my reality 
 More than just bread and wine 
 This is the end and the beginning 
 This is the eighth day of creation 
 One with the saints and angels 
 In our song of thanksgiving 
 Revelation 
 History shows the love 
 Of the ancient Father 
 For His one and only Son 
 Jesus, I am not worthy 
 I am a broken man 
 But only say the word 
 And I shall be healed again 
 This is the end and the beginning 
 This is the eighth day of creation 
 One with the saints and angels 
 In our song of thanksgiving 
 (Talking) If indeed what I am saying is true, 
 And this is what the Church says, 
 Then our hearts need to start burning 
 With a deeper understanding of who and what 
 This Eucharist is 
 Holy is the Lamb 
 Holy is the Lamb 
 This is the end and the beginning 
 This is the eighth day of creation 
 One with the saints and angels 
 In our song of thanksgiving

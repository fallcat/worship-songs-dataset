For all the thirsty in need of the river 
 For all the sleeping hearts waking from their slumber 
 For everyone still standing at the shoreline, come 
 For all the hurting souls running from their healer 
 For all the skeptics running from an answer 
 Let everyone who hears these words say come 
 For the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 Yeah, the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 For all the Pharisees, empty on the inside 
 For all the lovers who spent their love on a lie 
 For the forgotten, the Father's heart says come 
 For all the fatherless looking for approval 
 For all the daughters who've never heard they're beautiful 
 Let everyone who hears these words say come 
 For the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 Yeah, the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 For the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 Yeah, the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 Amen, amen 
 Come, Lord Jesus, come again 
 Until then, until then 
 Grace and peace be ours, amen 
 Amen, amen 
 Come, Lord Jesus, come again 
 Until then, until then 
 Grace and peace be ours, amen 
 Till You come again 
 Peace be ours, amen 
 Till You come again 
 Till You come again 
 For the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 Yeah, the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 For the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 Yeah, the Spirit and the Bride say come

You are mystery 
 You are eternity 
 You are infinite 
 You are fidelity 
 You are the great unknown 
 Yet your name is known 
 You are the only way 
 You are the living stone 
 You are above reproach 
 You are beyond fame 
 You are beyond the earth 
 That trembles at your name 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Yesterday, today and forever 
 You are the word made flesh 
 You are Immanuel 
 You are the son of man 
 You are the great I AM 
 The mountains melt like wax 
 Your will it is command 
 You shape and form my heart 
 Like clay to potter's hands 
 You are the righteous judge 
 You are the threshing floor 
 You are the silence in 
 The middle of the storm 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Yesterday, today and forever 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Yesterday, today and forever 
 Forever, forever 
 You never change 
 You never change 
 You never change 
 Your love remains the same 
 You never change 
 You never change 
 You never change 
 Your time remains the same 
 You never change 
 You never change 
 You never change 
 Your truth remains the same 
 You never change God 
 You never change God 
 You never change 
 Love remains the same 
 You're timeless 
 Timeless, timeless.

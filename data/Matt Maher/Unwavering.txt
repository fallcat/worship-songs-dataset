Blessed are the poor 
 The kingdom is theirs 
 Alive in the promise 
 To be dead to the world 
 Blessed are the meek 
 In honor of your Father 
 The Word at your right hand 
 The Spirit of truth 
 Unwavering is your voice 
 Unwavering is your hand 
 Unwavering is the heart that bled for the sins of men 
 Unwavering is your will 
 Unwavering is your plan 
 The fount of salvation on which we will stand 
 Blessed are the righteous 
 On bended knee 
 Found in this freedom 
 Committed to you 
 Blessed are those who see 
 The heights of glory 
 Found in the valley 
 And suffering for you 
 Unwavering is your voice 
 Unwavering is your hand 
 Unwavering is the heart that bled for the sins of men 
 Unwavering is your will 
 Unwavering is your plan 
 The fount of salvation on which we will stand 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Unwavering is your voice 
 Unwavering is your hand 
 Unwavering is the heart that bled for the sins of men 
 Unwavering is your will 
 Unwavering is your plan 
 The font of salvation on which we will stand 
 The font of salvation on which we will stand 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet 
 Send us out to be your hands and feet

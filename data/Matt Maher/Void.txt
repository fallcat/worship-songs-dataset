Riding down the streets of envy, 
 Looking for some recognition. 
 That would make me really happy: 
 If they desired my position. 
 Prom-time princess, beauty queen; 
 See all the admiring faces. 
 Chasing after blind ambition, 
 They don't see the King of Heaven's graces. 
 'Cause what I want is you; 
 What I need is truth. 
 Will someone tell me that for a change? 
 Nothing ever holds in a world lukewarm, 
 So come and fill the empty space inside of me. 
 Wish upon a falling star 
 And dream of your perfection. 
 It fades away held up against your failures 
 And dying self-opinion. 
 Beauty's on the late night TV, 
 Showing off the next big thing. 
 Turn it off ... I'm lost. 
 I forgot who I was. 
 Jesus, won't you tell me I'm worth something?

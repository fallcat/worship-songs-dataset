Spirit come and change the atmosphere 
 Convict all open hearts here 
 The anthems that the angels sing 
 The worship of the king of kings 
 For Jesus reigns 
 Over all he reigns 
 We exalt your name 
 High above the heavens 
 We exalt your name 
 All of creation sings praise 
 For Jesus reigns 
 Over all he reigns, yeah 
 Your presence fills and satisfies 
 Tear's down the walls we hide behind 
 Oh, god of every aching heart 
 We long for you in light and dark 
 For Jesus reigns 
 Over all he reigns 
 We exalt your name 
 High above the heavens 
 We exalt your name 
 All of creation sings praise 
 All of creation sings praise 
 For Jesus reigns 
 Over all he reigns 
 For Jesus reigns 
 Over all he reigns 
 You reign yes, 
 We exalt your name 
 High above the heavens 
 We exalt your name 
 All of creation sings praise 
 All of creation sings praise 
 For Jesus reigns 
 Over all he reigns 
 For Jesus reigns 
 Over all he reigns 
 We exalt your name 
 We exalt your name 
 We exalt your name

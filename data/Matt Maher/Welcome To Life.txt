Hello, good morning everyone 
 Underneath the glorious sun 
 I wrote a little song for you 
 Sometimes we forget we are 
 The image of the love of God 
 So please, if you don't mind 
 Let me remind you 
 That we were made to love each other 
 As a sister and a brother 
 Imitate perfection in this imperfect world 
 Hey, welcome to life! I hope you enjoy 
 In between yesterday and tomorrow 
 Welcome to life! I hope that you get it right 
 On the way, I do confess 
 We stumble, fall, and make a mess 
 Everything we try to hold dear 
 So be honest when you pray 
 And maybe thank him for today 
 And let go of the future 
 So unclear 
 Listen for the voice of mercy 
 Cast our all your fear and worry 
 Can't you see you've only got room for the cross? 
 Hey, welcome to life! I hope you enjoy 
 In between yesterday and tomorrow 
 Welcome to life! I hope that you get it right 
 And you live and you'll die 
 You'll be honest and you'll lie 
 Put your trust where the truth is 
 And you treasure where your heart is 
 So, welcome to life! I hope you enjoy 
 In between yesterday and tomorrow 
 Welcome to life! I hope that you get it 
 And, welcome to life! I hope you enjoy 
 In between yesterday and tomorrow 
 Welcome to life! I hope that you get it right 
 Hope that we get it right 
 Hope that I get it right 
 Welcome to life! 
 Welcome to life!

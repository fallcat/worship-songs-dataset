I was born on a rock in the middle of the ocean 
 Where the wind's so rough it can carry you to London 
 It's a new found land with an old soul reaching 
 For the light of day 
 My parents gave me a life full of dreams 
 Yeah, they gave me a heart to endure most anything 
 But everyone gets a broken pair of wings 
 And if you try to fly you'll fail 
 But a voice said, "Lift up your head" 
 And my heart burst out of my chest 
 I woke up in America for the love of God 
 I woke up in America for something bigger than myself 
 More than fireworks and fanfare, more than a star-spangled banner 
 You're still beautiful, America 
 Yeah, it's late in the night and I look in the mirror 
 Count the lines on my face and wonder how they got there 
 Oh but every one's a story of how grace appeared 
 And carried me through the day 
 And the voice said, "This land ain't dead" 
 You still got better days up ahead 
 I woke up in America for the love of God 
 I woke up in America for something bigger than myself 
 More than fireworks and fanfare, more than a star-spangled banner 
 You're still beautiful, America 
 I've seen the horizon ablaze in Arizona 
 Shoreline shoutin' over California 
 Moonlight dancin' over the Dakotas 
 It breaks your heart, it's so beautiful 
 Lady Liberty, she leaves the light on 
 From the west side all the way to Long Island 
 Carolina Coast to the Rocky Mountains 
 The sun is shining over me 
 I woke up in America for the love of God 
 I woke up in America for something bigger than myself 
 More than wealth or depression, more than a red or blue nation 
 Here in our hells and our heaven, you're still beautiful, America 
 You're beautiful, America 
 You're beautiful, America

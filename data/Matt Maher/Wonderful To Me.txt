I've been poor before 
 Maybe not in money, but in circumstance 
 And I have lavished in Your abundance 
 As You rain down Your blessings on me 
 No matter where I'm going 
 Let me feel Your blessing 
 'Cause my God is powerful, is so faithful 
 Is wonderful to me 
 My God is loveable, is approachable 
 Is wonderful to me 
 I've been hungry before 
 Aching for the word that strengthens me 
 And I've been fed by the body of Christ 
 In sacrament and in the midst of community 
 You prepare a heavenly feast 
 Where the greatest are the least 
 'Cause my God is powerful, is so faithful 
 Is wonderful to me 
 My God is loveable, is approachable 
 Is wonderful to me 
 And I shall live (and I shall live) 
 In the house of the Lord (in the house of the Lord) 
 All my days (all my days) 
 Now and forever (now and forever) 
 Yes I shall live (and I shall live) 
 In the house of the Lord (in the house of the Lord) 
 All my days (all my days) 
 Now and forever (now and forever) 
 'Cause my God is powerful, is so faithful 
 Is wonderful to me 
 My God is loveable, is approachable 
 Is wonderful to me 
 My God is powerful, is so faithful 
 Is wonderful to me 
 My God is loveable, is approachable 
 Is wonderful to me

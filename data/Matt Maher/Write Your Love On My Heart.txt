I'm waiting for a miracle 
 I'm waiting for a star to fall 
 I'm bankrupt and worn out 
 I need to know You're here now 
 When I've got nothing left to say 
 And I don't know how to pray 
 Would You write Your love on my heart? 
 When I struggle just to feel 
 And I wonder if You're real 
 Would You write Your love on my heart? 
 Write Your love on my heart 
 Take this condemnation 
 And all of my frustration 
 Lift me out of the mud 
 Come and fill an empty cup 
 When I've got nothing left to say 
 And I don't know how to pray 
 Would You write Your love on my heart? 
 When I struggle just to feel 
 And I wonder if You're real 
 Would You write Your love on my heart? 
 Write Your love on my heart 
 'Cause Your love opens eyes to see 
 Your love breaks through walls that surround me 
 Your love cries out from the deep to save me 
 When I've got nothing left to say 
 And I don't know how to pray 
 Would You write Your love on my heart? 
 When I struggle just to feel 
 And I wonder if You're real 
 Would You write Your love on my heart? 
 Write Your love on my heart 
 Write Your love on my heart 
 Write Your love on my heart 
 Write Your love on my heart

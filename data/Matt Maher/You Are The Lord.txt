You gave me a title although I didn't know you 
 You called my name and blessed me with life 
 Now I've squandered the fortunes of my childhood 
 Given into a world of lies 
 But I can't hide forever from what I know is true 
 Jesus I surrender my life to you 
 Cause you are the Lord and there is no other 
 You're my God and I'm not ashamed 
 I'll stand for you when the whole world falters 
 I will bear your name and I won't be the same 
 The mountains they move at the sound of your holy name 
 The lame will walk and the blind will see 
 I know you've won my heart, I know that I am nothing 
 You are the source of everything 
 And I can't live forever unless I live in you 
 Jesus I surrender my life to you

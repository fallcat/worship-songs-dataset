Lord, hear me 
 I am open 
 I surrender all my sins 
 All my pride gets me nowhere 
 Leaves me stranded, emptyhanded 
 So shatter the darkness in my life 
 As I carry this cross both day and night 
 All the way, All the way, To heaven 
 'Cause You know who I am 
 Lord, please take my hand 
 And lead me into community 
 You know who I am 
 Lord, help me to stand 
 Falling in love with your family 
 I confess to you, Jesus 
 And to you, my brothers and sisters 
 That I have sinned, and need forgiveness 
 Pray for me and I for you 
 So shatter the darkness in my life 
 As I carry this cross both day and night 
 All the way, All the way, To heaven 
 'Cause You know who I am 
 Lord, please take my hand 
 And lead me into community 
 You know who I am 
 Lord, help me to stand 
 Falling in love with your family 
 You know who I am 
 Lord, please take my hand 
 And lead me into community 
 You know who I am 
 Lord, help me to stand 
 Falling in love with your family 
 You know who I am 
 Lord, please take my hand 
 And lead me into community 
 You know who I am 
 Lord, help me to stand 
 Falling in love with your family 
 All the way (all the way) 
 All the way (all the way) 
 To heaven 
 All the way (all the way) 
 All the way (all the way) 
 To heaven

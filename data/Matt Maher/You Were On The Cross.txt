Lost, everything is lost 
 And everything I've loved before is gone 
 Alone like the coming of the frost 
 And a cold winter's chill in my stony heart 
 And where were You when all that I've hoped for? 
 Where You when all that I've dreamed? 
 Came crashing down in shambles around me 
 You were on the cross 
 Pain, could you take away the pain? 
 If I find someone to blame, would it make my life seem easier? 
 Alone, all my friends are asleep 
 And I can't find anyone to stay awake with me 
 Where were You when sin stole my innocence? 
 Where were You when I was ashamed? 
 Hiding in a life, I wish, I never made 
 You were on the cross, my God, my God, alone, alone 
 You were on the cross, You died for us, alone, alone 
 You were on the cross, victorious, alone, alone 
 You were there in all of my suffering 
 And You were there in doubt and in fear 
 I'm waiting on the dawn to reappear

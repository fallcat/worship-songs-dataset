Great is Your faithfulness, O God 
 You wrestle with the sinner's restless heart 
 You lead us by still waters into mercy 
 And nothing can keep us apart. 
 So, remember Your people 
 Remember Your children 
 Remember Your promise, O God 
 Your grace is enough. 
 Your grace is enough 
 Your grace is enough for me 
 Great is Your love and justice, God of Jacob 
 You use the weak to lead the strong 
 You lead us in the song of Your salvation 
 And all Your people sing along. 
 So, remember Your people 
 Remember Your children 
 Remember Your promise, O God 
 Your grace is enough 
 Your grace is enough 
 Your grace is enough for me 
 Yeah, Your grace is enough 
 Your grace is enough 
 Your grace is enough for me 
 Remember Your people 
 Remember Your children 
 Remember Your promise, O God 
 Your grace is enough 
 Your grace is enough 
 Your grace is enough for me 
 Yeah, Your grace is enough 
 Heaven reaches out to us 
 Your grace is enough for me 
 God I sing your grace is enough 
 I'm covered in Your love 
 Your grace is enough for me, for me 
 It's enough for me

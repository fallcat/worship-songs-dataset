Your love is extravagant 
 Your friendship, so intimate 
 I find I'm moving to the rhythms of Your grace 
 Your fragrance is intoxicating in the secret place 
 Your love is extravagant 
 Your love is extravagant 
 Your friendship, so intimate 
 I find I'm moving to the rhythms of Your grace 
 Your fragrance is intoxicating in the secret place 
 Your love is extravagant 
 Spread wide in the arms of Christ is a love that covers sin 
 No greater love have I ever known; You considered me a friend 
 Capture my heart again, capture my heart again 
 I find I'm moving to the rhythms of Your grace 
 Your fragrance is intoxicating in the secret place 
 Your love is extravagant 
 Spread wide in the arms of Christ is a love that covers sin 
 No greater love have I ever known; You considered me a friend 
 Capture my heart again, capture my heart again 
 Oh stir up my heart Oh God 
 Light the fires within 
 That my heart may burn for You and You alone 
 Be Lord of my life 
 You're my Lover, my Shelter, my Father 
 The only Peace I'll ever find is in You 
 The only Joy I'll ever find is in Your arms 
 Sweet Jesus 
 I may live with You 
 Help me die with You 
 Let me rise with You

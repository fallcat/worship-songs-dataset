Who could imagine a melody 
 True enough to tell of Your mercy? 
 Who could image a harmony 
 Sweet enough to tell of Your love? 
 I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day 
 And I know in my heart that there must be a way 
 To sing a greater song 
 A greater song to You on the earth 
 To sing a greater song 
 A greater song to You on the earth 
 Who could imagine a symphony 
 Grand enough to tell of Your glory? 
 Our highest praise but a feeble breath 
 A whisper of Your thunderous worth 
 I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day 
 And I know in my heart that there must be a way 
 To sing a greater song 
 A greater song to You on the earth 
 To sing a greater song 
 A greater song to You on the earth 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher, Lord 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher, Oh 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day 
 And I know in my heart that there must be a way 
 So hear me singing 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher and higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher 
 Hallelujah, we want to lift You higher

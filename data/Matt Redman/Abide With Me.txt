I have a home 
 Eternal home 
 But for now I walk this broken world 
 You walked it first 
 You know our pain 
 But You show hope can rise again up from the grave 
 Abide with me 
 Abide with me 
 Don't let me fall 
 And don't let go 
 Walk with me 
 And never leave 
 Ever close God abide with me 
 There in the night 
 Gethsemane 
 Before the cross 
 Before the nails 
 Overwhelmed 
 Alone You prayed 
 You met us in our suffering and bore our shame 
 O love that will not ever let me go 
 Love that will not ever let me go 
 You never let me go 
 Love that will not ever let me go 
 And up ahead 
 Eternity 
 We'll weep no more and sing for joy 
 Abide with me 
 We'll weep no more and sing for joy 
 Abide with me

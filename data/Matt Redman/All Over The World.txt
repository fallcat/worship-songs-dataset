Even as the world began 
 The stars they sang 
 And all the angels shouted for joy, shouted for joy 
 And looking back through history 
 Your people they have always had 
 A song they must sing, a song they must sing 
 We are the people of God 
 We'll sing Your song here on the earth 
 All over the world Your song will resound 
 All over the world Your praises ring out 
 We're living to see Your name and renown 
 All over the world 
 Young and old, near and far 
 There's a place for every heart 
 To join in Your song, join in Your song 
 Every nation, tribe and tongue 
 Come together, join as one 
 Give glory to God, oh, glory to God 
 We are the people of God 
 We'll sing Your song here on the earth 
 All over the world Your song will resound 
 All over the world Your praises ring out 
 We're living to see Your name and renown 
 All over the world 
 All over the world Your song will resound 
 All over the world Your praises ring out 
 We're living to see Your name and renown 
 All over the world 
 Great is Your name and great will be Your song 
 Great is Your name and great will be Your song 
 So great 
 We lift up our hands and pray 
 Lift up our hands and pray 
 For Holy is Your name 
 You will have Your praise 
 We give You glory in the North and the South 
 We give You glory in the East and the West 
 Your name will be known 
 Every tribe, every tongue 
 Your song will be sung 
 All over the world Your song will resound 
 All over the world Your praises ring out 
 Savior, we're living to see Your name and renown 
 All over the world 
 All over the world Your song will resound 
 All over the world Your praises ring out 
 We're living to see Your name and renown 
 All over the world

 Let our lives become an offering 
 Ever pleasing to Your heart 
 The glory of Your name our highest call

 All that really counts is found in You 
 What else would we live for? 
 You're the Way, the Life, the Truth 
 All that really matters is You

 Let our lives become a light for You 
 Like a city on a hill 
 We'll glorify Your name forevermore, Lord 
 All that really matters 
 All that really counts is found in You 
 What else would we live for? 
 You're the Way, the Life, the Truth 
 And all that really matters is You 
 Yes, it's You 
 King of glory, be the center 
 King of glory, You'll be the prize 
 We shall have no other treasure 
 All that counts is You lifted high

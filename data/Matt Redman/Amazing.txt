A love so undeserved, a gift that's free 
 You lavish on me 
 A peace I could not earn 
 And mercy for the freedom of my soul 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 Forgiveness runs so deep 
 Within Your heart of loving kindness 
 And should a soul forget 
 The cross of Christ reminds us everyday 
 Oh 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 Grace that You've given 
 That's what's so amazing about Your amazing grace 
 Lord, every day You pour on me 
 Your blessings of eternity 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 Your grace always amazes me 
 Your grace 
 So amazing, yeah 
 Freely I've received, now freely to give 
 Freely I've received, now freely to give 
 Freely I've received, now freely to give 
 Give my life to You 
 Oh, freely I've received, now freely to give 
 Freely I've received, now freely to give 
 Freely I've received, now freely to give 
 I'll Give my life to You, to You... 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 Everyday I sing 
 Everyday 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 Your grace is amazing 
 Lord, every day You pour on me 
 Your blessings of eternity 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 Your grace amazes me 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace 
 Oh, that's what's so amazing 
 I stand beneath the cross 
 That's what's so amazing about Your grace

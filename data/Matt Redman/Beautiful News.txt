Joy is the theme of my song 
 And the beat of my heart 
 And that joy is found in You 
 For You showed the power of Your cross 
 And Your great saving love 
 And my soul woke up to You 
 I heard Your beautiful news 
 Grace so amazing, so true... 
 Shout it out, let the people sing 
 Something so powerful should shake the whole wide world 
 Make it loud, make it louder still 
 Savior we're singing now to celebrate Your beautiful news

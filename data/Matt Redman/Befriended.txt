Befriended, befriended by the King above all Kings 
 Surrendered, surrendered to the friend above all friends 
 Invited, invited deep into this mystery 
 Delighted, delighted by the wonders I have seen 
 This will be my story 
 This will be my song 
 You'll always be my Saviour 
 Jesus, You will always have my heart 
 Astounded, astounded that Your gospel beckoned me (beckoned me) 
 Surrounded, surrounded, but I've never been so free 
 This will be my story 
 This will be my song 
 You'll always be my Saviour 
 Jesus, You will always have my heart 
 This will be my story 
 This will be my song 
 The song I sing 
 You'll always be my Saviour 
 Jesus, You will always have my heart 
 Determined, determined now to live this life for You 
 You're so worthy, my greatest gift would be the least You're due 
 This will be my story 
 This will be my song 
 You'll always be my Saviour 
 Jesus, You will always have my heart 
 This will be my story 
 All You've done in me 
 This will be my song 
 You'll always be my Saviour 
 Jesus, You will always have my heart 
 You're so worthy, my greatest gift would be the least You're due 
 Jesus, You're so worthy, my greatest gift would be the least You're due 
 My greatest gift would be the least You're due

I dream of tongues of fire 
 Resting on Your people 
 I dream of all the miracles to come 
 I hope to see the coming 
 Healing of the nations 
 I long to see the prodigals return 
 So many hopes and longings in You 
 When will all the dreams come true? 
 I'm a believer in Your Kingdom 
 I am a seeker of the new things 
 I am a dreamer with some old dreams 
 Let them now come 
 I hope to see You come down 
 Rend the mighty heavens 
 And let Your glory cover all the earth 
 To see Your sons and daughters 
 Come to know and love You 
 And find a purer passion in the church 
 These are the things my heart will pursue 
 When will all the dreams come true? 
 I'm a believer in Your Kingdom 
 I am a seeker of the new things 
 I am a dreamer with some old dreams 
 Let them now come 
 I'm a believer in Your Kingdom 
 I am a seeker of the new things 
 I am a dreamer with some old dreams 
 Will You now come 
 Will You come 
 Will You come 
 Will You come 
 Will You come, Lord 
 Hey 
 May Your church now reach out 
 Sowing truth and justice 
 Learn to love the poor and help the weak 
 When Your Kingdom's coming 
 It will touch the broken 
 Place the lonely in a family 
 So many hopes and longings in You 
 When will all the dreams come true? 
 I'm a believer in Your Kingdom 
 I am a seeker of the new things 
 I am a dreamer with some old dreams 
 Let them now come 
 Come, come, come, hey 
 I'm a believer in Your Kingdom 
 I am a seeker of the new things 
 I am a dreamer with some old dreams 
 Will You now come 
 Will You come 
 Will You come 
 Will You come, Lord 
 I'm a believer in the Kingdom, Lord 
 I'm a believer in Your Kingdom 
 I am a seeker of the new things 
 I am a dreamer with some old dreams 
 Let them now come 
 I'm a believer in Your Kingdom 
 I am a seeker of the new things 
 I am a dreamer with some old dreams 
 Will You now come

How lovely is Your dwelling place 
 O Lord Almighty 
 My soul longs and even faints for You 
 For here my heart is satisfied 
 Within Your presence 
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 One thing I ask, and I would seek 
 To see Your beauty 
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells 
 Your glory dwells 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 My heart and flesh cry out 
 For You, the Living God 
 Your Spirit's water for my soul 
 I've tasted and I've seen 
 Come once again to me 
 I will draw near to You 
 I will draw near to You 
 To You 
 Draw near to You 
 I will I will, I will 
 Draw near to You 
 To You 
 Better is one day 
 One day 
 One day 
 One day 
 One day 
 One day 
 Oh to be with you 
 Oh be with you 
 Oh to be, be with You 
 For here my heart is satisfied 
 For here my Spirit finds new life 
 For here I drink and I am satisfied 
 Within Your presence, Lord 
 I will draw near to You 
 One day 
 One day

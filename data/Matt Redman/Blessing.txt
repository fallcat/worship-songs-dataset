Here I am, I'm a soul set free 
 Caught up in this mystery 
 Jesus, there is a hope I breathe 
 For You are in me, You are in me 
 Here I am with my chains undone 
 Caught up in Your victory 
 Singing songs of a higher love 
 For You are with me, You are with me 
 And we are ever praising You 
 You brought a blessing and the blessing was You, yeah, yeah 
 There was a treasure, and the treasure was You, yeah, yeah 
 Lord, we had nothing, now we have all things 
 We were the lost but found the truth 
 You brought a blessing 
 And the blessing was You 
 As I walk through the valley low 
 I will build a place of hope 
 Going on from strength to strength 
 For You are in me, You are in me 
 Nothing good do You withhold 
 From the one who walks Your way 
 I'd give it all for just one day 
 That You are with me, You are with me 
 Yes, we are ever praising You 
 You brought a blessing and the blessing was You, yeah, yeah 
 There was a treasure, and the treasure was You, yeah, yeah 
 Lord, we had nothing, now we have all things 
 We were the lost but found the truth 
 You brought a blessing 
 And the blessing was You 
 Oh, the blessing was You 
 Hearts can find no rest until they find You 
 You made us for Yourself and we will praise You 
 We will praise You 
 You brought a blessing and the blessing was You, yeah, yeah 
 There was a treasure, and the treasure was You, yeah, yeah 
 Lord, we had nothing, now we have all things 
 We were the lost but found the truth 
 You brought a blessing 
 And the blessing was You 
 Jesus, the blessing was You 
 Jesus, the blessing was You, You 
 Oh, Jesus, the blessing is You

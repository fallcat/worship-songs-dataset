I know You love to crown the humble 
 Pouring out grace for the broken heart 
 You bless the meek, You meet the lowly 
 Lord, as I bow, lift me to You 
 I keep on bowing down, bowing down 
 Keep on bowing down, what else can I do? 
 I keep on bowing down, bowing down 
 What else can I do to give it all to You?  Hey 
 I'd like to be one such believer 
 Keeping my knees firmly on the ground 
 Well, I'd like to tread humbly before You 
 Lord, as I bow, lift me to You 
 I keep on bowing down, bowing down 
 Keep on bowing down, what else can I do? 
 I keep on bowing down, bowing down

 Do You smile when You see 
 A humble believer on their knees? 
 And, my Lord, will You be pleased 
 To look upon me 
 To look upon me? 
 Oh, I'm bowing down, bowing down

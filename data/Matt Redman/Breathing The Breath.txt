We have nothing to give 
 That didn't first come from Your hands 
 We have nothing to offer You 
 Which You did not provide 
 Every good, perfect gift comes from 
 Your kind and gracious heart 
 And all we do is give back to You 
 What always has been Yours 
 Lord, we're breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 And we're singing these songs 
 With the very same breath 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 Who has given to You 
 That it should be paid back to him? 
 Who has given to You 
 As if You needed anything? 
 From You, and to You, and through You 
 Come all things, O Lord 
 And all we do is give back to You 
 What always has been Yours 
 Lord, we're breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 And we're singing these songs 
 With the very same breath 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 Lord, we're breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 And we're singing these songs 
 With the very same breath 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We'll use it for Your glory 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We're breathing out Your praise 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 God, 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 Lord, We are breathing the breath 
 That You gave us to breathe 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 And we're singing these songs with the very same breath 
 To worship You, to worship You 
 To worship You

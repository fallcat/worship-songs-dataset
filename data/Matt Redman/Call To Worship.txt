We come to Your mountain 
 The hill of the Lord we would ascend 
 And journey into Your holy place 
 To feast in Your presence 
 And bring our devotions to You, God 
 We come as a Kingdom of Your priests 
 We're climbing up the mountain of the Lord 
 Towards Your holy place 
 And every step is praise 
 Encountering the glory of Your name 
 Your throne of holiness 
 The wonders of Your grace 
 We enter Your sanctuary 
 To minister at Your holy throne 
 Where thousands of angels joyfully sing 
 We're climbing up the mountain of the Lord 
 Towards Your holy place 
 And every step is praise 
 Encountering the glory of Your name 
 Your throne of holiness 
 The wonders of Your grace 
 Oh 
 Come, come let us worship 
 Come let us recognise what a sacred thing we do 
 Come, let us bow down 
 God, as we bring our hearts 
 Let them please the heart of You 
 We're climbing up the mountain of the Lord 
 Towards Your holy place 
 And every step is praise 
 Encountering the glory of Your name 
 Your throne of holiness 
 The wonders of Your grace 
 Oh 
 Come, come let us worship 
 Come let us recognise what a sacred thing we do 
 Come, let us bow down 
 God, as we bring our hearts 
 Let them please the heart of You 
 Come to meet You, Lord 
 Come, come let us worship 
 Come let us recognise what a sacred thing we do 
 Come, let us bow down 
 God, as we bring our hearts 
 Let them please the heart of You 
 Please the heart of You 
 Oh, to please Your heart

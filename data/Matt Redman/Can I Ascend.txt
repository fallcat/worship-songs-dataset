Can I ascend the hill of the Lord? 
 Can I stand in that holy place? 
 There to approach the glory of my God 
 Come towards to seek Your face 
 Purify my heart and purify my hands 
 For I know it is on holy ground I'll stand 
 I'm coming up the mountain, Lord, 
 I'm seeking You and You alone 
 I know that I will be transformed 
 My heart unveiled before You 
 I'm longing for Your presence, Lord 
 Envelope me within the cloud 
 I'm coming up the mountain, Lord 
 My heart unveiled before You 
 I will come

Can we walk upon the water 
 If our eyes are fixed on You 
 There's an air of faith within us 
 For a time of breaking through 
 Can we fly a little higher 
 Can we soar on eagles wings 
 Come and fan the flames of fire 
 That are flickering within 
 Lead us to the promised land 
 All that's purposed 
 All that's planned 
 Give us eyes of faith again 
 Take us on to higher ground 
 And the greater things to come 
 Where the eagles soar 
 And where we're finding more of You 
 Can we walk into the promise 
 Of abundance in the land 
 Take us on beyond the river 
 To the harvest You have planned 
 Let us see Your kingdom coming 
 In a measure we've not seen 
 There has been a time of sowing 
 Could this be a time to reap 
 And can we sing 
 The songs of heaven 
 While we're standing 
 On the earth 
 Sing within 
 The coming kingdom 
 Sing and live 
 And breathe and move 
 Can we fly a little higher 
 Can we fly a little higher 
 Can we fly a little higher 
 Can we fly a little higher

Behold the Author of our salvation 
 Behold the wonder of grace so free 
 Behold the blessing of true forgiveness at Calvary 
 Behold the answer for all the broken 
 Behold the mercy that makes a way 
 Behold the promise of perfect healing 
 At Calvary 
 Come and see come and see what God has done 
 Come and see come and see what love has won 
 In this place hearts and lives waking up 
 To the Light of the world 
 You're the Light of the world 
 Your cross is speaking words of freedom 
 No condemnation shall we now fear 
 Our shame is silenced 
 Your love has triumphed at Calvary 
 Come and see come and see what God has done 
 Come and see come and see what love has won 
 In this place hearts and lives waking up 
 To the Light of the world 
 You're the Light of the world 
 God it's Your love 
 Here on Display 
 We stand in awe 
 It takes our breath away 
 Come and see come and see what God has done 
 Come and see come and see what love has won 
 In this place hearts and lives waking up 
 To the Light of the world 
 You're the Light of the world 
 In this place hearts and lives waking up 
 To the Light of the world 
 You're the Light of the world 
 In this place hearts and lives waking up 
 To the Light of the world 
 You're the Light of the world

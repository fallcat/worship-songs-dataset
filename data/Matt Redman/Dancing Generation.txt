Your mercy taught us how to dance 
 To celebrate with all we have 
 And we'll dance to thank You for mercy 
 Your glory taught us how to shout 
 To lift Your name in all the earth 
 And we'll shout to the praise of Your glory 
 It's the overflow 
 Of a forgiven soul 
 And now we've seen You, God 
 Our hearts cannot stay silent 
 And we'll be a dancing generation 
 Dancing because of Your great mercy, Lord 
 Your great mercy, Lord 
 And we'll be a shouting generation 
 Shouting because of Your great glory, Lord

 It's the overflow 
 Of a forgiven soul

 Our hearts cannot stay silent 
 And we'll be a dancing generation 
 Dancing because of Your great mercy, Lord

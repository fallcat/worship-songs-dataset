When can I go and meet with God 
 My soul is weak my body tired 
 Can it be here 
 Can it be now 
 I need to find that place again 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 In the roar of Your waterfalls 
 You're calling me 
 With the force of Your love 
 Let Your waves sweep 
 Over all the dry places Lord 
 Usher me in 
 To the depths of Your heart 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 When can I come and meet You God 
 I thirst inside for heaven's touch 
 Let it be here 
 Let it be now 
 I need to find that place again 
 I want to know Your risen power 
 I need to share Your sufferings 
 And as I die to my own will 
 Lord raise me to that place again 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 In the roar of Your waterfalls 
 You're calling me 
 With the force of Your love 
 Let Your waves sweep 
 Over all the dry places Lord 
 Usher me in 
 To the depths of Your heart 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 Where deep calls to deep 
 Where deep calls to deep

When I stand before Your throne 
 Dressed in glory not my own 
 What a joy I'll sing of on that day 
 No more tears or broken dreams 
 Forgotten is the minor key 
 Everything as it was meant to be 
 And we will worship, worship 
 Forever in Your presence we will sing 
 We will worship, worship You 
 And endless hallelujah to the King 
 I will see You as You are 
 Love You with unsinning heart 
 And see how much You paid to bring me home 
 Not till then, Lord, shall I know 
 Not till then, how much I owe 
 Everything I am before Your throne 
 And we will worship, worship 
 Forever in Your presence we will sing 
 We will worship, worship You 
 And endless hallelujah to the King 
 No more tears, no more shame 
 No more sin and sorrow ever known again 
 No more fears, no more pain 
 We will see You face to face 
 See You face to face 
 And we will worship, worship 
 Forever in Your presence we will sing 
 We will worship, worship You 
 And endless hallelujah to the King 
 And we will worship, worship 
 Forever in Your presence we will sing 
 We will worship, worship You 
 And endless hallelujah to the King 
 And endless hallelujah to the King 
 We'll sing 
 And endless hallelujah to the King

So fearfully and wonderfully made 
 How could they say there is no God? 
 Reminded every breath that I take 
 It's by Your hand I have been formed 
 So what am I going to do with this life You gave me? 
 What could I do but live for Your praise? 
 You gave me this breath 
 And You gave me this strength 
 And every day I'll live to obey You 
 With all of my heart 
 With all of my soul 
 Let every breath I'm breathing display You, God 
 Oh 
 There's elegance in all You create 
 Your grand designs leave us amazed 
 The wonders of the way we've been made 
 Speak of Your power, and tell of Your grace 
 So what am I going to do with this life You gave me? 
 What could I do but live for Your praise? 
 You gave me this breath 
 And You gave me this strength 
 And every day I'll live to obey You 
 With all of my heart 
 With all of my soul 
 Let every breath I'm breathing display You, God 
 So what am I going to do with this life You gave me? 
 What am I going to do with this life? 
 What am I going to do in these days You've ordained? 
 What am I going to do with this life? 
 You gave me this breath 
 And You gave me this strength, oh Lord 
 And every day I'll live to obey You 
 With all of my heart 
 With all of my soul 
 Let every breath I'm breathing display You, God 
 All my life, all my days 
 All my life, all my days 
 All my life, all, God 
 How could they say there is no God?

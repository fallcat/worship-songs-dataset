You will keep the fires burning 
 You will keep the fires burning 
 You will keep the fires burning 
 You will keep the fires burning 
 We're standing in the desert of dry bones 
 But still we see Your life 
 Walking through the valley of shadows 
 But holding onto light 
 And we're waiting, waiting on You God 
 And our hearts will trust, trust in who You are 
 God who keeps our fires burning 
 Burning through the darkest night 
 See the hope in our hearts 
 The faith in our eyes 
 You can move the highest mountain 
 You can keep our dreams alive 
 You're the joy of our hearts 
 You're the fire in our eyes 
 We're standing in the desert of dry bones 
 But still we see Your life 
 Walking through the valley of shadows 
 But holding onto light 
 And we're waiting, waiting on You God 
 And our hearts will trust, trust in who You are 
 God who keeps our fires burning 
 Burning through the darkest night 
 See the hope in our hearts 
 The faith in our eyes 
 You can move the highest mountain 
 You can keep our dreams alive 
 You're the joy of our hearts 
 You're the fire in our eyes 
 Light up our lives with holy flame 
 All for the honor of Your name 
 Give us the strength to face the day, Jesus 
 Light up our lives with holy flame 
 All for the honor of Your name 
 Give us the strength to face the day 
 You're the fire in our eyes 
 God who keeps our fires burning 
 Burning through the darkest night 
 See the hope in our hearts 
 The faith in our eyes 
 You can move the highest mountain 
 You can keep our dreams alive 
 You're the joy of our hearts 
 You're the fire in our eyes 
 You're the fire in our eyes 
 You're the fire in our eyes 
 You're the fire in our eyes 
 You will keep the fires burning 
 You will keep the fires burning 
 You will keep the fires burning 
 You will keep the fires burning

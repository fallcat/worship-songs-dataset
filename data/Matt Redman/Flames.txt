Let it rise 
 Let it rise 
 An everlasting flame 
 A fire for Your Name 
 Let it rise 
 Let it rise 
 A holy offering 
 That's burning from within 
 We'll shine bright 
 And lift up Your Name 
 We lift Your Name high 
 Let all our hallelujahs be Yours 
 All our hallelujahs be Yours 
 From the altar of our hearts o God 
 Let flames of worship rise 
 We lift You high 
 Lift You high 
 An everlasting flame 
 A fire for Your Name 
 We lift You high 
 Lift You high 
 A holy offering 
 Burning from within 
 For You a fire 
 For You an everlasting flame 
 For You a passion that burns 
 A passion that burns 
 For Your everlasting Name

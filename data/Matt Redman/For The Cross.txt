I will love You for the cross 
 And I will love You for the cost 
 Man of sufferings 
 Bringer of my peace 
 You came into a world of shame 
 And paid the price we could not pay 
 Death that brought me life 
 Blood that brought me home 
 Death that brought me life 
 Blood that brought me home 
 And I love You for the cross 
 I'm overwhelmed by the mystery 
 I love You for the cost 
 That Jesus You would do this for me 
 When you were broken, You were beaten, 
 You were punished, I go free 
 You were wounded and rejected 
 In Your mercy - I am healed 
 Jesus Christ the sinners friend 
 Does this kindness know no bounds 
 With your precious blood You have purchased me 
 Oh the mystery of the cross 
 You were punished You were crushed 
 But that punishment has become my peace 
 Yes that punishment has become my peace 
 And I love You for the cross 
 I'm overwhelmed by the mystery 
 I love You for the cost 
 That Jesus You would do this for me 
 When you were broken, You were beaten, 
 You were punished, I go free 
 You were wounded and rejected 
 In Your mercy - I am healed 
 By Your wounds I am healed 
 For the cross, for the cross, for the cross I thank You 
 Oh Lord, for the cross, for the cross 
 And I love You for the cross 
 I'm overwhelmed by the mystery 
 I love You for the cost 
 That Jesus You would do this for me 
 When You were broken, You were beaten, 
 You were punished, I go free 
 You were wounded and rejected 
 In Your mercy - I am healed

We will dance, we will dance for Your glory 
 We will dance, we will dance for Your glory 
 We will dance for Your glory, Lord 
 We will lift up a shout to adore You 
 Every sound that we make, it is for You 
 We will dance for Your glory, Lord 
 For salvation's in this place 
 You're the name by which we're saved, Jesus, Jesus 
 Let Your name be lifted high 
 As our thankful hearts now cry, "Jesus, Jesus" 
 Lift up your heads, you ancient gates 
 Be lifted up, you ancient doors 
 The King is coming in, the King is coming in 
 We lift up a shout to shake the skies 
 Lift up a cry, "Be glorified!" 
 The King is coming in, the King is coming in 
 We're the people of God with a song to sing 
 And we're bringing our lives as an offering 
 We will dance for Your glory, Lord 
 And Your cross is the hope that we hold up high 
 As we tell the whole world of Your love and life 
 We will dance for Your glory, Lord

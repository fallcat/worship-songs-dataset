The skies are filled with your glory 
 The oceans mirror your grace; 
 How deep, how high, how wonderful you are. 
 The earth is telling Your mystery 
 The heavens singing your praise 
 How deep, how high, how wonderful you are. You are 
 The nails, the thorns and the offering 
 As you surrendered Your breath. 
 How deep, how high, how wonderful you are 
 Now We're becoming an offering 
 Singing with ever last breath 
 How deep, how high, how wonderful you are, you are. 
 We're living to tell Your story now, 
 Your glory and grace, O, God 
 Gloria 
 Glor - a! 
 Heaven and earth sing how great you are. 
 Gloria 
 Glori - a 
 To You evermore! 
 To You Evermore! 
 Gloria! 
 And yours is the kingdom 
 And the power and the glory 
 Yours is the anthem 
 Yours is the anthem 
 And the honour and the story

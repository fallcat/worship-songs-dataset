When we were in the darkest night 
 And wondered if our eyes would ever see the light 
 You were there, Lord 
 When we were in the stormy gale 
 And wondered if we'd ever live in peace again 
 You were there, Lord 
 You were there in the struggle 
 You were there in the fight 
 You were there all the time 
 We praise You - the God of our yesterdays 
 We praise You - the God who is here today 
 We praise You - our God as tomorrow comes 
 So whatever lies ahead 
 Whatever roads our grateful hearts will come to tread 
 You'll be there, Lord 
 We will fix our eyes on You 
 And know that there is grace enough to see us through 
 You'll be there, Lord 
 You'll be there in the struggle 
 You'll be there in the fight 
 You'll be there all the time 
 We praise You - the God of our yesterdays 
 We praise You - the God who is here today 
 We praise You - our God as tomorrow comes 
 We thank you - for grace in our yesterdays 
 We thank you - for peace in our hearts 
 We thank you - for joy, as tomorrow comes 
 We will trust you, God 
 You're always closer than we know 
 Always more involved and in control 
 We will trust our lives to You 
 The One who wasand is and is to come

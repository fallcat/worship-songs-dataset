Blessings before me, blessings behind me 
 Forever You are good 
 Battles before me, battles behind me 
 I'll look to You alone 
 You are good forever and Your love endures 
 You are good forever and Your love endures 
 Jesus, always, Your love remains 
 You are good, You are good 
 From the beginning to everlasting 
 Your kindness knows no end 
 And should the earth shake, 
 Should every star fade 
 Still You will never fail 
 God, You will never fail 
 You are good forever and Your love endures 
 You are good forever and Your love endures 
 Jesus, always, Your love remains 
 You are good, You are good 
 In battle, in blessing 
 Your love never fails us 
 Unending, unchanging 
 What could come against 
 In battle, in blessing 
 Your love never fails us 
 Unending, unchanging 
 What could come against 
 Your love for us, Your love for us 
 Your love for us, Your love for us 
 You are good forever and Your love endures 
 You are good forever and Your love endures 
 Jesus, always, Your love remains 
 You are good, You are good 
 You are good, You are good 
 You are good, You are good 
 Blessings before me, blessings behind me 
 Forever You are good

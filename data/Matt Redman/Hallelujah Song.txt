With the choir of angels singing, 
 And the realm of heavenly hosts 
 As those elders humbly bow, 
 I'd love to come to Your throne with a simple song 
 With the little creatures speaking, 
 Praise and praise and praise again 
 With the company of heaven, 
 I'd love to come to Your throne with a song of love 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, pouring out my heart to You 
 I would bring this praise like incense 
 Rising to Your throne above 
 Fill the air with heart-filled songs 
 Harmony and melody for the One I love 
 Singin' hallelujah, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, pouring out my heart to You 
 Singin' Jesus, pouring out my heart to You 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, pouring my heart to You 
 Who can tell the adoration 
 That will rise up to Your throne 
 Every knee that day shall bow 
 To the King of kings, the Holy One, the only One 
 We'll all be singing... 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu 
 All be singing 
 Hallelujah, Jesus, pouring out my heart to You 
 To You, to You, to You, to You, to You 
 Hallelujah Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu 
 With the choir of angels, with the living creatures speaking their 
 Praise and praise and praise again 
 Hallelujah Jesus, pouring out my heart to You 
 The elders bowing down 
 Hallelujah Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu 
 Singing, singing hallelujah, singing hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah Jesus, pouring out my heart to You 
 Hallelujah Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu 
 You're the one I love, You're the one I love, You're the one I love 
 Hallelujah Jesus, pouring out my hear to You 
 Hallelujah

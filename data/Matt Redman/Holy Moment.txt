As we come today, we remind ourselves of what we do 
 That these songs are not just songs, but signs of love for You 
 As we come today, we remind ourselves of what we do 
 That these songs are not just songs, but signs of love for You 
 This is a holy moment now, something of heaven touches earth 
 Voices of angels all resound - we join their song 
 Come, come, come, let us worship God 
 With our hands held high and our hearts bowed down 
 Lord, with confidence we come before Your Throne of Grace 
 Not that we deserve to come, but You have paid the way 
 You are the holy King of all, heaven and earth are in your hands 
 All of the angels sing Your song - we join them now 
 Come, come, come, let us worship God 
 With our hands held high and our hearts bowed down 
 We will run, run, run through Your gates, O God 
 With a shout of love, with a shout of love 
 Let this be a holy moment now

 Come, come, come, let us worship God (worship God) 
 With our hands held high and our hearts bowed down 
 We will run, run, run through Your gates,  (straight to You, Lord) O God 
 With a shout of love, with a shout of love 
 Let us come 
 Come, come, come, let us worship God 
 With our hands held high and our hearts bowed down 
 We will run, run, run through Your gates,  O God 
 With a shout of love, with a shout of love 
 With a shout of love, with a shout of love 
 With a shout of love, with a shout of love

Now unto the king who reigns over all, 
 And never changes or turns 
 Unfailing justice, unfading grace, 
 Whose promises remain, 
 Yes, Your promises remain. 
 The heavens ring, the saints all sing, 
 Great is your faithfulness 
 From age to age we will proclaim 
 Great is your faithfulness, 
 How great is your faithfulness. Yes 
 Everything changes, but your stay the same; 
 Your word and kingdom endure 
 We lean on the promise of all that you are, 
 And trust forevermore 
 We will trust forevermore 
 From generation to generation 
 You never fail us oh God 
 Yesterday and today and tomorrow 
 Until the day you return 
 How great is your faithfulness

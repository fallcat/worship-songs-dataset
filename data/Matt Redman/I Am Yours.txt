God of restoration, 
 My hope is in the life You bring to me. 
 Healer of my wounds, 
 I thank You, oh I thank You. 
 God of my salvation, 
 With saving love You came to rescue me. 
 Healer of my soul, 
 I thank You, oh I thank You, 
 Today and every day. 
 I am Yours, I am Yours, 
 Every breath that I breathe, 
 Every moment that's lived. 
 I am Yours, I am Yours, 
 You're the reason to breathe, 
 You're the reason to live. 
 And now everyone that You have saved 
 Will come to be Your praise, 
 I am Yours. 
 Singing of a love now, 
 You taught this broken heart to sing again. 
 Every day I'll come 
 To thank You, oh, to thank You. 
 Singing of a life now, 
 You taught this wounded soul to live again. 
 Every day I'll live 
 To thank You, oh, to thank You, 
 Today and every day. 
 And if my food is to do Your will, 
 Then I'm hungry, still hungry; 
 There's so much more that I need to give 
 To thank You, to thank You. 
 Yes, if my food is to do Your will, 
 Then I'm hungry, still hungry; 
 There's so much more that I need to give 
 Today and every day.

I've filled my time with preparations 
 Worn the cloak of endless serving 
 Though this is a part of loving 
 Something can grow cold 
 I've wandered through 
 This life's distractions 
 Clouding out my soul's attraction 
 When I take the time to listen 
 I can hear You call 
 I need to get the fire back 
 Lord like the first time 
 I need to get the fire back 
 You are my first love 
 The embers still remain 
 But Lord I miss the flame 
 I need to get the fire back 
 Looking now upon the reason 
 I am living I am breathing 
 Holy Father You are showing 
 All I need to know 
 I must take the time to listen 
 Not to know You from a distance 
 But to find in all Your nearness 
 You and You alone

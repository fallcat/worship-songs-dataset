On this thirsty desert ground 
 In a dry and barren land 
 I bow down 
 I need You now 
 You will call and I will come 
 To Your river I will run 
 I bow down 
 I need You now 
 Oh, living water. Oh, God, my Savior 
 If I ever needed You, I need You now 
 Oh, living water, Oh, God, my Healer 
 If I ever needed You, I need You now 
 You're the start and You're the end 
 You complete what You begin 
 I bow down 
 I need You now 
 You will call and I will come 
 To Your river I will run 
 I bow down 
 I need You now 
 Oh, living water. Oh, God, my Savior, 
 If I ever needed You, I need You now 
 Oh, living water, Oh, God, my Healer, 
 If I ever needed You, I need You now 
 Just like the desert needs the blessing of the rain 
 Just like the winter, waiting for the sun again 
 I need you now 
 Just like a river as it reaches for the sea 
 Just like a song, it needs the sound of melody 
 I need you now 
 I need You now 
 If I ever needed You 
 I need You now 
 Just like the desert needs the blessing of the rain 
 Just like the winter, waiting for the sun again 
 I need You now 
 Oh, living water. Oh, God, my Savior 
 If I ever needed You, I need You now 
 Oh, living water, Oh, God, my Healer 
 If I ever needed You, I need You now

I'll live for the highest Name 
 I'll live for what matters most 
 Let the glory of who You are burn in my soul 
 I'll carry the highest Name 
 I'll treasure what matters most 
 Let the glory of who You are burn in my soul 
 And I turn, I turn to Christ alone 
 I surrender all, I surrender 
 And I live, I live for You alone 
 All my heart and soul I surrender 
 Whatever may come my way 
 Whatever tomorrow holds 
 Let the glory of who You are stay in my soul 
 And I turn, I turn to Christ alone 
 I surrender all, I surrender 
 And I live, I live for You alone 
 All my heart and soul I surrender 
 I turn to Christ 
 I give my heart 
 I give my life 
 I turn to Christ 
 I'm living for something so much greater 
 And I turn, I turn to Christ alone 
 I surrender all, I surrender 
 And I live, I live for You alone 
 All my heart and soul I surrender 
 I turn to Christ 
 I give my heart 
 I give my life 
 I turn to Christ 
 I'm living for something so much greater 
 And I turn, I turn to Christ alone 
 I surrender all, I surrender 
 And I live, I live for You alone 
 All my heart and soul I surrender 
 I turn to Christ 
 I give my heart 
 I give my life 
 I turn to Christ 
 I'm living for something so much greater 
 Whatever may come my way 
 Whatever tomorrow holds 
 Let the glory of who You are stay in my soul 
 I turn, I will turn to Christ

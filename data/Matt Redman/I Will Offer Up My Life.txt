I will offer up my life in spirit and truth 
 Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to You 
 In surrender I must give my every part 
 Lord, receive the sacrifice of a broken heart 
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring 
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King? 
 Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung 
 As a praise of Your name for the things You have done? 
 O my words could not tell, not even in part 
 Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart 
 You deserve my every breath for You've paid the great cost 
 Giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross 
 You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin 
 Opened up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in 
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring 
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King? 
 Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung 
 As a praise of Your name for the things You have done? 
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring 
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King? 
 Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung 
 As a praise of Your name for the things You have done? 
 O my words could not tell, not even in part 
 Of the debt of love that is owed 
 Of the debt of love that is owed 
 Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart 
 Oh 
 By this thankful heart 
 By this thankful heart 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 What can I give? 
 What can I bring? 
 What can I sing as an offering, Lord? 
 What can I give? 
 What can I give to You, to You? 
 Now, what can I give? 
 What can I bring? 
 What can I sing as an offering, Lord? 
 What can I give? 
 What can I bring? 
 What can I sing as an offering, Lord? 
 What can I give to You, to You? 
 What can I give? 
 What can I bring? 
 What can I sing as an offering, Lord? 
 What can I give?

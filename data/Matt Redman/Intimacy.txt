One thing my heart is set upon 
 One thing that I would ask 
 To know You, Lord, as close as one 
 Could hope to on this earth 
 Intimacy 
 O Jesus, intimacy 
 My treasure will be, O Jesus 
 Your intimacy 
 To look upon Your beauty, Lord 
 Your glory and Your heart 
 To know You close, and closer still 
 Watch day upon this earth 
 Intimacy 
 O Jesus, intimacy 
 My treasure will be, O Jesus 
 Your intimacy 
 Lord, since the day I saw You first 
 My soul was satisfied 
 And yet because I see in part 
 I'm searching, more to find 
 Intimacy 
 O Jesus, intimacy 
 My treasure will be, O Jesus 
 Your intimacy 
 Intimacy 
 O Jesus, intimacy 
 My treasure will be, O Jesus 
 Your intimacy 
 Intimacy 
 O Jesus, intimacy 
 My treasure will be, O Jesus 
 Your intimacy

Our scars are a sign 
 Of grace in our lives 
 Oh Father how You brought us through 
 When deep were the wounds 
 And dark was the night 
 The promise of Your love You proved 
 Now every battle still to come 
 Let this be our song 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well 
 It is well with my soul 
 Weeping may come 
 Remain for a night 
 But joy will paint the morning sky 
 You're there in the fast 
 You're there in the feast 
 Your faithfulness will always shine 
 Now every blessing still to come 
 Let this be our song 
 You lead us through battles 
 You lead us to blessing 
 And You make us fruitful 
 In the land of our suffering God 
 It is well 
 It is well with my soul 
 I trust Your ways 
 I trust Your Name 
 It is well 
 It is well with my soul

It's rising up from coast to coast 
 From north to south and east to west 
 The cry of hearts that love Your name 
 Which with one voice we will proclaim 
 The former things have taken place 
 Can this be the new day of praise? 
 A heavenly song that comes to birth 
 And reaches out to all the earth 
 O let the cry to nations ring 
 That all may come and all may sing 
 Holy is the Lord 
 (Every heart sing) holy is the Lord 
 (With one voice sing) holy is the Lord 
 (All the earth sing) holy is the Lord 
 And we have heard the Lion's roar 
 That speaks of heaven's love and power 
 Is this the time, is this the call 
 That ushers in Your Kingdom rule? 
 O let the cry to nations ring 
 That all may come and all may sing 
 Jesus is alive 
 (Every heart sing) Jesus is alive 
 (With one voice sing) Jesus is alive 
 (All the earth sing) Jesus is alive 
 Jesus 
 It's rising up, it's rising up 
 It's rising up from coast to coast 
 From north to south and east to west 
 The cry of hearts that love Your name 
 Which with one voice we will proclaim 
 So let the cry to nations ring 
 That all may come and all may sing 
 Holy is the Lord 
 (Every heart sing) holy is the Lord 
 (With one voice sing) holy is the Lord 
 (All the earth sing) holy is the Lord 
 Yes, we will sing, yes, we will sing Your praise 
 We will sing 
 Hallelujah 
 Sing Your praises, God 
 We will sing to You 
 It's rising up 
 The cry of hearts that love Your name 
 It's rising up 
 And we will never be the same 
 It's rising up 
 With a new passion for Your name 
 It's rising up 
 It's rising, rising, rising, rising up 
 Can you hear it it? 
 It's rising up 
 Can you hear it now? 
 From the east and the west 
 It's rising up 
 Can you hear it? Can you hear it? 
 Can you hear the nations come? 
 Can you hear it? Can you hear it? 
 Something's changing, something's coming 
 It's rising up

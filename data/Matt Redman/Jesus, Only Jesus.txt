Who has the power to raise the dead? 
 Who can save us from our sins? 
 He is our hope, our righteousness 
 Jesus, only Jesus 
 Who can make the blind to see? 
 Who holds the keys that set us free? 
 He paid it all to bring us peace 
 Jesus, only Jesus 
 Holy, King Almighty, Lord 
 Saints and Angels all adore 
 I join with them and bow before 
 Jesus, only Jesus 
 Who can command the highest praise? 
 Who has the name above all names? 
 You stand alone, I stand amazed 
 Jesus, only Jesus 
 You will command the highest praise 
 Yours is the name above all names 
 You stand alone, I stand amazed 
 Jesus, only Jesus 
 Jesus, only Jesus 
 I worship 
 Jesus, only Jesus 
 Jesus, only Jesus

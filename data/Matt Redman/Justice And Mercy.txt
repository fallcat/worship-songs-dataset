You've put a new song in my mouth 
 It is a hymn of praise to You 
 Justice and mercy are its theme 
 And I will live it back to You 
 The kind of fast You've chosen, Lord 
 It must reach out 
 To broken lives and to the poor 
 So change me, Lord 
 I know You are the orphan's hope 
 I know You are the widow's song 
 O Lord, You're showing me what's on Your heart 
 You've put a new song in my mouth 
 It is a hymn of praise to You 
 It's a hymn of praise 
 Justice and mercy are its theme 
 Justice and mercy 
 And I will live it back to You 
 Lord, I won't bring an empty song 
 It's meaningless 
 Without compassion in my life and holiness 
 You're Father where no father lives 
 And to the lonely You're a Friend 
 O Lord, You're showing me what's on Your heart 
 What is on Your heart 
 You've put a new song in my mouth 
 It is a hymn of praise to You 
 It is to You 
 Justice and mercy are its theme 
 Justice and mercy 
 And I will live it back to You 
 Live it back to You 
 I know You are the orphan's hope, I know You are the widow's song 
 You're Father where no father lives, and to the lonely You're a Friend 
 O Lord, You're showing me what's on Your heart 
 You're a Friend 
 Let justice roll like a river 
 Let mercy flow to the needy 
 Oh 
 You're showing me what's on Your heart 
 You've put a new song in my mouth 
 It is a hymn of praise to You 
 Justice and mercy are its theme 
 And I will live it back to You 
 Let justice roll like a river 
 Let mercy flow to the needy 
 This is our song 
 This is the choir 
 Where You go, we will go, we will go 
 Because we love You, Lord

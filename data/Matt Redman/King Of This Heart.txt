Time is too short to say it's okay 
 To think i can live this way 
 For just another day 
 So I'll search through the night for the One my heart loves 
 Won't stop 'til I've found You for, Lord, I need to hold You close 
 Be the King of this heart again 
 Be the King of this life 
 In my soul there's a cry today 
 Be the King of this heart 
 Be the King of this heart 
 I've stood in the desert and thirsted for You 
 I've run through the city, now I won't let go 
 I'm throwing myself on Your mercy, O God 
 You say it's all or nothing 
 I'm saying, "Jesus, have it all" 
 Be the King of this heart again 
 Be the King of this life 
 In my soul there's a cry today 
 Be the King of this heart 
 You'll be the King of this heart 
 Be the light for my eyes, be the strength for my feet 
 Be the love of my soul, be my everything 
 Be my day and my night, when I wake, when I sleep 
 Undivided my heart will be 
 Be the King of this heart again 
 Be the King of this life 
 In my soul there's a cry today 
 Be the King of this heart 
 Would you be 
 Be the King of this heart always 
 You say it's all or nothing 
 I'm saying, "Jesus, have it all" 
 Be the King of this heart again 
 Be the King of this life, yeah 
 In my soul there's a cry today 
 Be the King of this heart 
 Would you be the King of this heart, Jesus 
 Would you be the King of this heart 
 I need You today 
 The King of this heart always 
 You're the King of this heart 
 You're the King of this heart 
 You will be 
 You will be the King of this heart

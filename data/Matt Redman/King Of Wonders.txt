We could try to count the stars 
 You already know them each by name 
 Every single galaxy was Your design 
 Your majesty displayed 
 Your glory shines before our eyes 
 The more we see, the more we love You 
 King of wonders, we stand amazed 
 There's no other, other than You 
 King of wonders, You know the way to our hearts 
 And the more we see, the more we love You 
 You reveal and we respond 
 You have shown there's no one like You, God 
 Your love and mercy welcomes us 
 Into the beauty of this Holiness 
 Your glory shines before our eyes 
 The more we see, the more we love You 
 King of wonders, we stand amazed 
 There's no other, other than You 
 King of wonders, You know the way to our hearts 
 And the more we see, the more we love You 
 King of wonders, we stand amazed 
 There's no other, other than You 
 King of wonders, You know the way to our hearts 
 And the more we see, the more we love You 
 The more we see, the more we love You, God 
 Your glory shines before our eyes 
 You shine, You shine 
 King of wonders, we stand amazed 
 There's no other, other than You 
 King of wonders, You know the way to our hearts 
 And the more we see, the more we love You 
 King of wonders, we stand amazed 
 There's no other, other than You 
 King of wonders, You know the way to our hearts 
 And the more we see, the more we love You 
 The more we see, the more we love You, God

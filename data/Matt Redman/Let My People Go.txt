You stand for freedom freedom 
 You stand for justice in this world 
 So many stolen, stolen 
 Slaves to the shadows of this earth 
 But these are Your sons and daughters God 
 And though the darkness seems so strong 
 Your fire of justice breaks the night 
 We hear You cry 
 Let my people go, let my people go 
 Light a fire in the dark 
 A fire in the dark 
 Let my people go 
 Light a fire in the dark 
 A fire in the dark 
 Let my people go 
 So we'll stand for freedom, freedom 
 We'll stand for justice in this world 
 All of the stolen, stolen 
 Never forgotten in Tour heart 
 These are Your sons and daughters God 
 And though the darkness seems so strong 
 Your fire of justice breaks the night 
 We're ready to fight 
 Another stolen life another hidden cry 
 But these are Your sons and daughters God 
 Trafficked in the night broken by the fight 
 Rescue Your sons and daughters God 
 Another stolen life another hidden cry 
 But these are Your sons and daughters God 
 Trafficked in the night broken by the fight 
 We hear the cry

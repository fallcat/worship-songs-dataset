O, Jesus Son of God, so full of grace and truth 
 The Father's saving Word, so wonderful are You 
 The angels longed to see and prophets searched to find 
 The glory we have seen revealed 
 You shone upon the earth, but who will understand? 
 You came unto Your own, but who will recognise? 
 Your birth was prophesied, for You were the Messiah 
 Who came and walked upon the earth 
 Your glory we have seen, the one and only King 
 And now You're living in our hearts 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 In You all things were made and nothing without You 
 In heaven and on earth all things are held in You 
 And yet You became flesh, living as one of us 
 Under the shadow of the cross 
 Where, through the blood You shed, You have made peace again 
 Peace for the world that God so loves 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us (And in Your life, we see light) 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us (Oh, You change darkness into light) 
 Oh, Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us (Keep on shining, Lord, yeah) 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 And yet You became flesh, living as one of us 
 Under the shadow of the cross 
 Where, through the blood You shed, You have made peace again 
 Peace for the world that God so loves 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Oh, Light of the world (light of the world, light of the world), 
 Light of the world light of the world) 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us  (Oh, and we know, and we know) 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us 
 Light of the world, Light of the world 
 Light of the world, You shine upon us

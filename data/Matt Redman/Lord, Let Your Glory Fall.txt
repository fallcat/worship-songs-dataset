You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures, today 
 Lord, let Your glory fall 
 As on that ancient day 
 Songs of enduring love 
 And then Your glory came 
 And as a sign to You 
 That we would love the same 
 Our hearts will sing that song 
 God, let Your glory come 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures, today 
 Voices in unison 
 Giving You thanks and praise 
 Joined by the instruments 
 And then Your glory came 
 Your presence like a cloud 
 Upon that ancient day 
 The priests were overwhelmed 
 Because Your glory came 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures, today 
 Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 Yes, You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 Yes, You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures, today 
 Your love endures today 
 Your anger lasts a moment, but Your favor lasts a life time 
 Your anger lasts a moment, but Your favor lasts a life time 
 A sacrifice was made 
 And then Your fire came 
 They knelt upon the ground 
 And with one voice they praised 
 And they sang to You, oh God 
 And they called upon 
 Sing it out, sing it out 
 Praise of Your name 
 Come like the wind 
 Come like the fire 
 Work in our hearts 
 Our souls to inspire 
 You are good 
 You are good 
 You are good 
 You are good 
 You are good 
 You are good 
 You are good 
 You are good 
 Oh, 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures, Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 Yes, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures  today

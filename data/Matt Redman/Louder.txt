There's a song that cannot be contained 
 There's a shout that breaks through every chain 
 God we won't be silent 
 There's a faith that rises through the flames 
 There's a joy that chases the dark away 
 God we won't be silent 
 And the greater the storm 
 The louder our song 
 We lift our voices 
 Lift our voices 
 Make Your praise so glorious 
 Glorious 
 We lift our voices 
 Lift our voices 
 Make Your praise so glorious 
 We'll never stop singing 
 We'll never stop singing

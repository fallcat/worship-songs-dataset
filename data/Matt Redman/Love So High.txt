Outside the city walls 
 On a wooden cross 
 A light in the darkness 
 Bleeding from Your hands 
 Flowing from Your side 
 A river of mercy 
 A river of mercy 
 Your love so great 
 Higher than the stars 
 Unfailing love 
 Deeper than the sea 
 Your love so sure 
 It's everything to me 
 How deep, how wide, how long, how high 
 (Jesus) 
 Thorns that made a crown 
 Forgiveness falling down 
 Your wounds are our healing 
 The earth began to move 
 And all of heaven knew 
 Death was defeated 
 And all because of You Jesus 
 Your love so great 
 Higher than the stars 
 Unfailing love 
 Deeper than the sea 
 Your love so sure 
 Stronger than the mountains 
 Oh Your love 
 It's everything to me 
 Your love so great 
 Higher than the stars 
 Unfailing love 
 Deeper than the sea 
 Your love so sure 
 Stronger than the mountains 
 Oh Your love 
 It's everything to me 
 Your love so great 
 Higher than the stars 
 Unfailing love 
 Deeper than the sea 
 Your love so sure 
 Stronger than the mountains 
 Oh Your love 
 It's everything to me 
 How deep, how wide, how long, how high 
 How deep, how wide, how long, how high 
 How deep, how wide, how long, how high 
 Your love so high 
 Your love so high 
 Your love so high 
 Your love so high

You show Your majesty 
 In every star that shines 
 And every time we breathe 
 Your glory, God, revealed 
 From distant galaxies 
 To here beneath our skin 
 You are higher than we ever could imagine 
 And closer than our eyes could ever see 
 You are... 
 Magnificent, You alone are holy 
 No one else as glorious as You 
 Magnificent, Jesus You are worthy 
 Who can shine as brightly as You do? 
 Magnificent 
 You're so magnificent 
 You're lighting up our lives 
 Illuminate our hearts 
 With everything You are 
 You are higher than we ever could imagine 
 And closer than our eyes could ever see 
 You are... 
 Magnificent, You alone are holy 
 No one else as glorious as You 
 Magnificent, Jesus You are worthy 
 Who can shine as brightly as You do? 
 Magnificent 
 You're so magnificent 
 Magnificent 
 You're so magnificent 
 You are higher than we ever could imagine 
 And closer than our eyes could ever see 
 We are pouring out our hearts here in Your presence 
 Magnificent, You alone are holy 
 No one else as glorious as You 
 Magnificent, Jesus You are worthy 
 Who can shine as brightly as You do? 
 Magnificent 
 You're so magnificent 
 Magnificent 
 You're so magnificent

I will wait for You 
 In the morning light 
 My song will rise to give You glory 
 Draw me near to You 
 Captivate my heart 
 And open up my eyes to see 
 Your majesty 
 Fill my heart with Your pure light 
 The majesty of the Most High 
 I'm overwhelmed by Your holiness 
 The wonder of amazing grace 
 I bow beneath 
 The majesty of the Most High God 
 I cast all my cares 
 Down at Your feet 
 You meet me here with tender mercy 
 And everything You are 
 Is everything I need 
 I lift my hands surrender to 
 Those who look to You are radiant 
 How they shine 
 How they shine 
 Just one glimpse of You 
 And we will be changed 
 How You shine 
 How You shine

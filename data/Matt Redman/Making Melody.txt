I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 Pouring out Your praise 
 With everything within 
 Oh, I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 Yours will always be the song I love to sing 
 Oh, how can hearts not love Your name? 
 How can souls not sing Your praise? 
 Oh, Jesus, You've put music in my soul 
 And I'll sing to You, Lord 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 Pouring out Your praise 
 With everything within 
 Oh, I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 I'm making melody in my heart to You 
 Yours will always be the song I love to sing 
 Oh, how can hearts not love Your name? Your name? 
 How can souls not sing Your praise?

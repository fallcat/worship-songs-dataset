I will kneel in the dust 
 At the foot of the cross 
 Where mercy paid for me 
 Where the wrath I deserve 
 It is gone, it has passed 
 Your blood has hidden me 
 Mercy, mercy 
 As endless as the sea 
 I'll sing Your hallelujah 
 For all eternity 
 We will lift up the cup 
 And the bread we will break 
 Remembering Your love 
 We were fallen from grace 
 But You took on our shame 
 And nailed it to a cross 
 Mercy, mercy 
 As endless as the sea 
 I'll sing Your hallelujah 
 For all eternity 
 May I never lose the wonder 
 Oh, the wonder of Your mercy 
 May I sing Your hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Amen

Let worship be the fuel for mission's flame 
 We're going with a passion for Your name 
 We're going for we care about Your praise 
 Send us out 
 Let worship be the heart of mission's aim 
 To see the nations recognize Your fame 
 'Til every tribe and tongue voices Your praise 
 Send us out 
 You should be the praise of every tongue 
 You should be the joy of every heart 
 But until the fullness of Your kingdom comes 
 Until that final revelation dawns 
 Send us out 
 Let worship be the fuel for mission's flame 
 We're going with a passion for Your name 
 We're going for we care about Your praise 
 Send us out, out 
 You should be the praise of every tongue, Jesus 
 You should be the joy of every heart 
 But until the fullness of Your kingdom comes 
 Until that final revelation dawns 
 Send us out 
 Every tribe, every tongue 
 Every creature in the heavens and the earth 
 Every heart, every soul 
 Will sing Your praise, will sing Your praise 
 Every note, every strain 
 Every melody will be for You alone 
 Every harmony that flows from every tongue 
 We'll sing Your praise, we'll sing Your praise 
 We'll sing Your praise, we'll sing Your praise 
 You should be the praise of every tongue, Jesus 
 You should be the joy of every heart, oh 
 You should be the praise of every tongue, Lord 
 You should be the joy of every heart 
 But until the fullness of Your kingdom comes 
 Until that final revelation dawns, You will surely come 
 Send us out, cry it out to Him 
 Send us out, give Him yourself 
 Send us, oh, send us out 
 Cry it out 
 Send us out, we are Yours 
 Send us out, use us, Lord 
 Send us out, fill us, Lord 
 Send us out 
 Let worship be the fuel for mission's flame 
 We're going with a passion for Your name 
 We're going for we care about Your praise 
 Send us out 
 Send us out 
 Send us out 
 Send us out

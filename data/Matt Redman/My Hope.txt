My hope is built 
 On nothing less 
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness 
 I dare not trust 
 The sweetest frame 
 But wholly lean 
 On Jesus' name 
 When the mountains are falling 
 When the waters are rising 
 I shall be safe in You 
 Though the nations are quaking 
 Every kingdom be shaken 
 Still I will rest in You 
 When darkness seems 
 To hide Your face 
 I rest on Your 
 Unchanging graces 
 In every high 
 And stormy gale 
 My anchor holds 
 Within the veil

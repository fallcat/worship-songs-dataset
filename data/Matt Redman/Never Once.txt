Standing on this mountaintop 
 Looking just how far we've come 
 Knowing that for every step 
 You were with us 
 Kneeling on this battle ground 
 Seeing just how much You've done 
 Knowing every victory 
 Was Your power in us 
 Scars and struggles on the way 
 But with joy our hearts can say 
 Yes, our hearts can say 
 Never once did we ever walk alone 
 Never once did You leave us on our own 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful 
 Kneeling on this battle ground 
 Seeing just how much You've done 
 Knowing every victory 
 Was Your power in us 
 Scars and struggles on the way 
 But with joy our hearts can say 
 Yes, our hearts can say 
 Never once did we ever walk alone 
 Never once did You leave us on our own 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful 
 Scars and struggles on the way 
 But with joy our hearts can say 
 Never once did we ever walk alone 
 Carried by Your constant grace 
 Held within Your perfect peace 
 Never once, no, we never walk alone 
 Never once did we ever walk alone 
 Never once did You leave us on our own 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful 
 Every step we are breathing in Your grace 
 Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful 
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful

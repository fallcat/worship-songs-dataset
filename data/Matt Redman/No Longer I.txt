At the cross 
 At the cross 
 Where I first saw the light 
 And the burden of my soul rolled away 
 It was there by faith 
 I received my sight 
 Now no longer I but Christ in me 
 I will run to the cross 
 Where You opened up my eyes 
 I will sing of the love that saved me 
 I will bow in the place 
 Where Your death became my life 
 I will run 
 I will run to the cross 
 Oh how endless the hope 
 Oh how empty the grave 
 And the joy of a stone rolled away 
 It is there by grace 
 I am raised to life 
 Now no longer I but Christ in me 
 It is no longer I 
 It is Christ who lives in me 
 Christ who lives in me 
 Christ who lives in me

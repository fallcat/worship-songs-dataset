Hallelujah chains are broken 
 Your death has spoken life to us 
 And every accusation 
 All our condemnation 
 Silenced at the cross 
 Hallelujah free salvation 
 The burden of a world so lost 
 Lifted from our shoulders 
 Carried by the Savior's 
 Passion at the cross 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like our Savior 
 How great is Your blessing 
 How great is Your love 
 There is no one like our God 
 Never has there been 
 Never will there be 
 A God like You 
 Who came down in mercy 
 Never will there be 
 A greater hope than this 
 There is no one like our God

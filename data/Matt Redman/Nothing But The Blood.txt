Your blood speaks a better word 
 Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth 
 Speaks righteousness for me 
 And stands in my defense 
 Jesus, it's Your blood 
 Your blood 
 Your blood speaks a better word 
 Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth 
 Speaks righteousness for me 
 And stands in my defense 
 Jesus, it's Your blood 
 What can wash away our sins? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can wash us pure as snow 
 Welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Nothing but Your blood 
 Nothing but Your blood, King Jesus 
 Your cross testifies in grace 
 Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us 
 Now boldly we approach 
 Not earthy confidence 
 It's only by Your blood 
 What can wash away our sins? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can wash us pure as snow 
 Welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Nothing but Your blood 
 Nothing but Your blood, King Jesus 
 What can wash? 
 What can wash away our sins? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood 
 Well, it's nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Oh 
 What can wash us pure as snow 
 Forever welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Nothing but Your blood 
 Nothing but Your blood, King Jesus 
 King Jesus 
 It's Your blood, it's Your blood 
 Oh 
 It's Your blood, it's Your blood 
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven 
 Singing of the blood 
 Singing of Calvary 
 Singing of salvation today 
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven 
 It's the blood, it's the blood 
 It's the blood, it's the blood 
 It's the blood, it's the blood 
 It's the blood, it's the blood 
 What can wash away our sins? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 The sinless blood of Jesus 
 What can wash us pure as snow 
 Forever welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Well, it's nothing but the blood 
 It's nothing but Your blood, King Jesus 
 We praise You for the blood 
 Yes, we praise You for the blood 
 We've been ransomed, we've been healed, we've been restored, and forgiven 
 Thank You, Lord 
 Oh, so we will 
 We praise You for the blood 
 We praise You for the blood 
 What can cleanse away our sin 
 Nothing but Your blood 
 Nothing but Your blood, King Jesus 
 King Jesus 
 King Jesus

Nothing is too much to ask 
 Now that I have said I'm Yours, I'm Yours 
 Jesus, take the whole of me…unreservedly 
 Jesus, take me deeper now 
 That I might go further, too, oh 
 I've received so much from You…undeservedly 
 I was made to love You, Lord 
 I was made to love 
 I was saved to worship You 
 You will be the focus of all eternity, yeah, yeah 
 I was made to love You, Lord 
 I was made to love 
 I was saved to worship You 
 You will be the focus of all eternity, yeah 
 I was made to love - spoken 
 And I was made to love You, Lord 
 I was saved to worship You, You, You, You, You 
 You will be the focus of all eternity 
 Nothing is too much to ask (nothing is too much to ask) 
 Now that I have said I'm Yours 
 Jesus, take the whole of me…unreservedly 
 I was made to love You

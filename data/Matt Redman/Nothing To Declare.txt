A hundred thousand hearts a day 
 Are vacuumed in along these runways 
 In specks of iron from around the world 
 Drawn to the magnetism in this place 
 I've watched them land in the Heathrow haze 
 Through 'Nothing to Declare' into cars that speed away 
 I'm watching the aeroplanes comin' in 
 Waiting for a miracle 
 Watching the aeroplanes comin' in 
 Wonderin' if I'll see you again 
 Wonder if I'll see you again 
 I understand how you had to leave 
 You said 'back soon' and I must believe 
 My feelings haven't changed since that fateful day 
 You left me grounded and you flew away 
 Over my house into the clouds 
 To foreign lands in the sunshine 
 I watch the seven forty sevens climb 
 Over my house into the clouds 
 To foreign lands in the sunshine 
 I wave bye bye, bye bye, 
 A hundred thousand hearts a day 
 Come gliding down but they don't explain 
 An empty seat on a sold out flight 
 A year ago on an empty night 
 I watched you down but you never came 
 Through 'Nothing to Declare' like a sign hangin' on my name 
 I'm watching the aeroplanes comin' in 
 Waiting for a miracle 
 Watching the aeroplanes 
 Wonderin' if I'll see you... again 
 Over my house 
 My house

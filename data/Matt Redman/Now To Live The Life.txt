Many are the words we speak 
 Many are the songs we sing 
 Many kinds of offerings 
 But now to live the life 
 Many are the words we speak 
 Many are the songs we sing 
 Many kinds of offerings 
 But now to live the life 
 Help us live the life 
 Help us live the life 
 All we want to do is bring you something real 
 Bring You something true 
 (We hope that) Precious are the words we speak 
 (We pray that) Precious are the songs we sing 
 Precious all these offerings 
 But now to live the life 
 Help us live the life 
 Help us live the life 
 All we want to do is bring you something real 
 Bring You something true 
 Help us live the life 
 Help us live the life 
 All we want to do is bring you something real 
 Bring You something true 
 Now to go the extra mile 
 Now to turn the other cheek 
 And to serve You with a life 
 Let us share your fellowship 
 Even of your sufferings 
 Never let the passion die... 
 Now to live the life... 
 Now to live the life 
 Now to live the life 
 Now to live the life

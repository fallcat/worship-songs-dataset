O sacred King, O holy King 
 How can I honour You rightly, rightly 
 Honour that's fit for Your Name? 
 O sacred Friend, O holy Friend 
 I don't take what You give lightly, lightly 
 Friendship instead of disgrace 
 For it's the mystery of the universe 
 You're the God of holiness 
 And yet You welcome souls like me 
 And with the blessing of Your Father's heart 
 You discipline the ones You love 
 There's kindness in Your majesty 
 Jesus, those who recognise Your power 
 Know just how wonderful You are 
 That You draw near 
 It's a mystery

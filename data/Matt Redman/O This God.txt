You light up our way 
 You bring a brighter future 
 You light up our lives 
 Your love is like no other 
 We are going to shine 
 Now we are going to shine for You 
 You light up our way 
 You bring a brighter future 
 You light up our lives 
 Your love is like no other 
 We are going to shine 
 Now we are going to shine for You 
 We won't fear the night 
 We are looking straight ahead 
 Never turning back 
 Counting on Your faithfulness 
 O this God is our God even till the end 
 Standing strong over us, time and time again 
 Even till the end 
 We've walked through storms and 
 We have walked through sorrow 
 Still You won't let them steal away tomorrow 
 We are going to shine 
 Now we are going to shine for You 
 We leave the old behind 
 It will not define us, no 
 Yesterday is gone 
 Now anything is possible 
 O this God is our God even till the end 
 Standing strong over us, time and time again 
 Even till the end 
 O this God is our God even till the end 
 Standing strong over us, time and time again 
 Even till the end 
 O this God is our God even till the end 
 Standing strong over us, time and time again 
 Even till the end 
 O this God is our God even till the end 
 Standing strong over us, time and time again 
 Even till the end 
 Jesus, You will always be our God 
 And we won't take our eyes off You 
 Jesus, You'll forever be the One 
 We'll have no other God but You 
 Jesus, You will always be our God 
 And we won't take our eyes off You 
 Jesus, You'll forever be the One 
 We'll have no other God but You

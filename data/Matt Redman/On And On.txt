Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 There will be no other but You 
 In the north and in the south 
 Every corner of the globe 
 For the weak and for the strong 
 With the young and with the old 
 On and on Your praises run 
 It's an everlasting song 
 There will be no other but You 
 Your song will be heard in all of the earth 
 You will have Your praise, yeah 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 There will be no other but You 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 There will be no other but You 
 Your song will be heard in all of the earth 
 You will have Your praise, Jesus 
 It's an everlasting song, yeah, yeah 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 There will be no other but You 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Oh, on and on 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 Nothing can stand in the way of the song 
 Hallelujah, there will be no other 
 There will be no other but You 
 Let it be heard 
 Let it be sung 
 Let it be known 
 Around the world

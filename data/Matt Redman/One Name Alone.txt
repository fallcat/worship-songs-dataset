Everybody praises the thing they love 
 Everyone announces what they adore 
 Where you lay your treasure there is your heart 
 There is Your heart there you find your heart 
 Everybody's singing a song inside 
 Bowing down low with a sacrifice 
 We speak many words but our hearts we show 
 By what we're spending our lives upon 
 One name alone I am living for 
 One name my heart and my soul adore 
 Be the first and the last 
 Be the song that I sing 
 Jesus be my everything 
 Let if be seen in this life now 
 If anyone should look my way at all 
 This I prize and treasure most 
 You my God and You alone 
 Well it's You my God and only You 
 One name alone I am living for 
 One name my heart and my soul adore 
 Be the first and the last 
 Be the song that I sing 
 Jesus be my everything 
 Everybody praises the thing they love 
 I'll be praising You my God 
 Everybody praises the thing they love 
 I'll be praising You my God

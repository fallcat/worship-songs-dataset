Seasons may change, passions may fade 
 But one thing remains 
 Fashions they pass, here for a day 
 But one thing remains 
 I'll always love 
 I'll always love 
 I'll always love Your name 
 Troubles may come, hardship and pain 
 But one thing remains. 
 And when I am weak, when I am frail 
 One thing remains 
 I'll always love 
 I'll always love 
 I'll always love Your name 
 Your name 
 You'll always be 
 You'll always be 
 You'll always be my praise 
 Just as the sun will rise up everyday 
 And as the dawn will always find a way 
 And oceans never cease to bear their waves 
 I'll always find a way to bring You praise 
 Always, Jesus, Always... always 
 Seasons may change, passions may fade 
 But one thing remains 
 Fashions they pass, here for a day 
 But one thing remains 
 I'll always love 
 I'll always love, love 
 I'll always love Your name 
 Your name, Your name 
 You'll always be 
 You'll always be 
 You'll always be my praise 
 Just as the sun will rise up everyday 
 And as the dawn will always find a way 
 And oceans never cease to bear their waves 
 I'll always find a way to bring You praise 
 Always, Jesus, Always 
 Always, Jesus, 
 Always always always always! 
 Just as the sun will rise up everyday 
 Just as the dawn will always find a way 
 And oceans they never cease to bear their waves 
 I'll always find a way I'll always find a way to bring You 
 Praise, always, Your praise, 
 Always, Always, Always, 
 Always, Jesus, Always 
 Always, Jesus, 
 Always always always always 
 One thing remains...

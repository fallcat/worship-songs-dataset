O, to see You as You are 
 To glimpse the wonders yet unseen 
 Assist my sight, unveil my eyes 
 To see You 
 Lord, to know You as You are 
 To even dare to speak or stand 
 Though marked beloved, to fall as dead 
 When I see You 
 And through grace untold, to see You 
 With this heart unveiled, to know You 
 Lord, in Your pure light 
 How great the glory of Your name 
 How small the voice I humbly bring 
 Yet with my all I raise a song 
 When I see You 
 It is the song of love's pure light 
 The grace reflected in these eyes 
 The overflow of those who know 
 They have seen You 
 And through grace untold, to see You 
 With this heart unveiled, to know You 
 Lord, in Your pure light 
 We were disgraced, but You graced us 
 With the warmth of Your forgiveness 
 Now You lead us ever closer 
 To the pure light of Your holiness 
 And through grace untold, to see You 
 With this heart unveiled, to know You 
 Through grace 
 And through grace untold, to see You 
 With this heart unveiled, to know You 
 Lord, in Your pure light 
 And I'll sing of the wonders of Your grace 
 Sing of the wonders of Your grace 
 Sing of the wonders of Your grace, O Lord 
 And I'll tell of the glory of Your name 
 Tell the of glory of Your name 
 Tell the of glory of Your name, O Lord 
 And I'll sing of the wonders of Your grace 
 Sing of the wonders of Your grace 
 Sing of the wonders of Your grace, O Lord 
 AndI will tell of the glory of Your name 
 Tell the of glory of Your name 
 Tell the of glory of Your name, O Lord 
 And through grace untold, to see You 
 With this heart unveiled, to know You 
 Lord, in Your pure light 
 God, in Your pure light 
 Open our eyes 
 See pure light

Create in me the purest of hearts 
 According to Your unfailing love 
 Renew a steadfast spirit within 
 And wash away my sin 
 And make me like the snow 
 But even whiter still 
 I just want to have 
 A pure heart 
 I just want to have 
 A pure pure heart 
 I just want to have 
 A pure heart 
 I just want to have 
 A pure pure heart 
 I'm clay within the Potter's hand 
 Where tenderness meets discipline 
 I need it all Lord come and form 
 Your holiness in me 
 And make me like the snow 
 But even whiter still 
 I just want to have 
 A pure 
 Purify me, Lord 
 I just want to have 
 A pure pure heart 
 I just want to have 
 A pure 
 I just want to have 
 A pure pure heart 
 Purify me 
 I just want to have 
 A pure heart 
 I just want to have 
 A pure pure heart 
 I just want to have 
 A pure 
 I just want to have 
 A pure pure heart 
 Create in me the purest of hearts 
 According to Your unfailing love 
 Renew a steadfast spirit within 
 And wash away my sin 
 And make me like the snow 
 But even whiter still 
 Pure, pure heart 
 Pure, pure heart

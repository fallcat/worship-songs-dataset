Make Your praise glorious in this place 
 Now let's shout You out around the world 
 Now let's sing it out around the earth 
 Come on church, come on church 
 Raise a voice, raise a voice 
 Tell your God how great He is 
 Tell the world how great He is 
 Tell our God, tell our God how great He is 
 Tell the world how great He is 
 Yea! 
 Your glory, Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 All of the angels know it as they sing their songs to You 
 All those elders know it as they bow down before You 
 The living creatures know it as they speak their endless praise 
 And we will join that song here upon the earth 
 We will raise voice in praise of You 
 We will raise voices in praise of You 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Lift a shout to the King of kings 
 Oh! 
 Lift a shout to the King above all kings 
 Oh! 
 It's Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 It's Your glory 
 Yes Lord! 
 Yes Lord!

 It's You! 
 You're the King of glory

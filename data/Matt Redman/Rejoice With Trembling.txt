We could watch You from afar 
 And forever be amazed 
 At how glorious You are 
 Yet You've drawn us close to You 
 Where the wonder's greater still 
 And You overwhelm us, God 
 And we rejoice with trembling in our hearts 
 Bring You a song of reverence and love 
 Jesus, how good, how great You are 
 And we rejoice with trembling 
 Before Your throne 
 Who could fully voice the praise 
 Of the God of endless days 
 Tell a fraction of Your worth? 
 For we only sing in part 
 Of the grace of who You are 
 Just an echo, just a glimpse 
 And we rejoice with trembling in our hearts 
 Bring You a song of reverence and love 
 Jesus, how good, how great You are 
 And we rejoice with trembling 
 Before Your throne 
 With trembling 
 Just and echo, just a glimpse of who You are 
 The splendor of You 
 Oh 
 We rejoice with trembling in our hearts 
 Bring You a song of reverence and love 
 Jesus, how good, how great You are 
 And we rejoice with trembling 
 Before Your throne 
 Your throne 
 How good, how great You are 
 Jesus, we have seen how good, how great You are 
 We rejoice with trembling 
 Before Your throne

We do not worship an unknown God 
 For You've revealed Yourself to us 
 And the more we see, the more we love 
 This revelation of Your heart 
 And we are falling, falling, falling 
 We are falling so in love with You, yeah 
 Beyond all question, You're a mystery 
 We have known the shallows of the mighty deep 
 Unsearchable greatness of a holy God 
 Yet day by day You reveal Your heart 
 And we are falling, falling, falling 
 We are falling so in love with You 
 Well, how could hearts not love Your Name 
 While all creation sings Your praise 
 And every breath points back to You, Jesus? 
 Now in part we see You, then face to face 
 And we'll know You fully, as we're fully known 
 And the depths of glory You now hide away 
 They will be revealed on that glorious day 
 And we are falling, falling, falling 
 We are falling so in love with You 
 Well, how could hearts not love Your Name 
 While all creation sings Your praise 
 And every breath points back to You, Jesus? 
 Oh, we are falling, falling, falling 
 So in love 
 We are falling, falling, falling 
 So in love with You 
 We are falling, falling, falling 
 Yeah, falling in love 
 We are falling, falling, falling 
 We are falling, falling, falling 
 We are falling, falling, falling, 
 Yeah, falling, falling so in love 
 We are falling, falling, falling, 
 So, so, so, so in love 
 We are falling, falling, falling, 
 The more we see of You, the more we fall in love with You again 
 We are falling, we are falling, so, so, so, so in love

Joy, joy, unspeakable joy 
 Hope like never before 
 You came for us 
 You are our freedom 
 Love, love, unshakeable love 
 We shall overcome, we will never give up 
 We lift a shout, we lift a shout 
 Everyone singing 
 Come on, come on now, we've got a new song 
 Come on, come on now, a song of liberty 
 Let the world hear heaven's melody 
 This is the shout of the hearts You've set free 
 True, true, we know it's true 
 We stand now, risen with You 
 You lifted us 
 You are our freedom 
 Strong, strong, whatever may come 
 You have already won 
 We lift a shout, we lift a shout 
 Everyone singing 
 And we'll dance, dance 
 Dance in Your freedom 
 Oh, Your glorious freedom 
 Forevermore, forevermore

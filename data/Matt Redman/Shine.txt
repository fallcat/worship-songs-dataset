Lord, we have seen the rising sun, awakening the early dawn 
 And we're rising up to give You praise 
 Lord, we have seen the stars and moon, see how they shine 
 They shine for You 
 And You're calling us to do the same 
 So we rise up with a song, and we rise up with a cry 
 And we're giving You our lives 
 We will shine like stars in the universe 
 Holding out Your truth in the darkest place 
 We'll be living for Your glory 
 Jesus, we'll be living for Your glory

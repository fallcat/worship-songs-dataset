I hear the sound of an army waking 
 I feel the ground under my feet shaking 
 Let justice roll like a river 
 Let justice roll like a river 
 We're your hands, we're your feet, your people 
 Love good and hate what's evil 
 Let justice roll like a river, let justice roll 
 We shout, shout for Your kingdom come 
 Shout, shout and the walls fall down 
 Our God be praised, whoa oh oh oh 
 We shout, shout to the ends of the earth 
 Shout, shout until You return 
 Our God be praised, whoa oh oh oh 
 You're the friend of the ones forgotten 
 You fight the cause of the weak and broken 
 Let justice roll like a river, 
 Let justice roll like a river, let justice roll... 
 We shout, shout for Your kingdom come 
 Shout, shout and the walls fall down 
 Our God be praised, whoa oh oh oh 
 We shout, shout to the ends of the earth 
 Shout, shout until You return 
 Our God be praised, whoa oh oh oh 
 Someone's gonna dance for the first time 
 Hear the music, hear the music 
 Someone's gonna find their healing 
 Hear the music, hear the music 
 Someone's gonna dance for the first time 
 Hear the music, hear the music 
 Someone's gonna run to freedom 
 Hear the music, here it comes 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 We shout, shout for Your kingdom come 
 Shout, shout and the walls fall down 
 Our God be praised, whoa oh oh oh 
 We shout, shout to the ends of the earth 
 Shout, shout until You return 
 Our God be praised, whoa oh oh oh 
 Someone's gonna dance for the first time 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 Someone's gonna find their healing 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 Someone's gonna dance for the first time 
 Whoa oh oh oh 
 Someone's gonna run to freedom 
 Whoa oh oh oh

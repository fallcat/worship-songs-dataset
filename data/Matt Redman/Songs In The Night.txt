God You can tell the waves be still 
 Tell the ocean roar to pass 
 Lord until it does 
 I'll wait here 
 God You can part the raging sea 
 Bring the miracle I need 
 Lord until it comes 
 I'll wait here 
 And I will sing 
 Songs in the night 
 Praise in the storm 
 You're God in it all 
 And I will stand 
 I'll be still and know 
 Whatever may come 
 You're God in it all 
 And so when I am in the storm 
 Lord the storm is not in me 
 You will be my peace 
 I'll wait here 
 I'll wait here 
 Your love 
 Your love 
 Won't leave me in the shadows 
 Oh Your love 
 Your love 
 Forever by my side 
 I will not be afraid 
 You are my song in the night

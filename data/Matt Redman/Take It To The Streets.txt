I am not a stranger to mercy, for You found me 
 Wrapped Your truth around me 
 I am not a stranger to grace 
 I have seen it in Your face 
 I am not a stranger to kindness 
 We're the broken with Your life inside us 
 You have brought Your gospel to me 
 And I breathe it every day 
 How did I become Your miracle? 
 Now to take Your truth and tell the world... 
 I'm going to take it to the streets 
 I'm going to sing it 'til we meet 
 Heaven is open 
 Come on all the earth rejoice 
 I'm going to take it to the streets 
 Wake up the dead heart from its sleep 
 Heaven is open 
 Now's the time to raise our voice 
 I must tell the world of this mercy, for You found me 
 Wrapped Your truth around me 
 I must tell the world of this grace 
 I have seen it at Your cross 
 I must tell the world of this kindness 
 We're the broken with Your life inside us 
 You have brought Your gospel to me 
 Help me live it every day 
 How did we become Your miracles? 
 Now to take Your truth and tell the world 
 I'm going to take it to the streets 
 I'm going to sing it 'til we meet 
 Heaven is open 
 Come on all the earth rejoice 
 I'm going to take it to the streets 
 Wake up the dead heart from its sleep 
 Heaven is open 
 Now's the time to raise our voice 
 Whoa, whoa, raise your voice 
 Whoa, take it to the streets now whoa 
 How did I become Your miracle? 
 Now to take Your truth and tell the world 
 I'm going to take it to the streets 
 I'm going to sing it 'til we meet 
 Heaven is open 
 Well, come on all the earth rejoice 
 I'm going to take it to the streets 
 Wake up the dead heart from its sleep 
 Heaven is open

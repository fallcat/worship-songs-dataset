The disease of my soul was spreading 
 Eating me up on the inside 
 Keeping my heart from Your new life 
 And I see now where I was headed 
 For there is no cure that can save us 
 Outside of Your mercy, Lord Jesus 
 Yes, You stepped in with Your power to save 
 Let forgiveness reign 
 Worked a miracle within 
 Thank You for healing me 
 I was dying beneath my shame 
 But You brought me to life again, I will sing 
 Thank You for freeing me 
 I was dead to the truth of You 
 But my healing was in Your wounds, and now I sing 
 Thank You for healing me

 Thank You for healing me 
 Though outwardly I may waste away 
 On the inside I'll be more alive every day 
 As I walk through times of pain and grief 
 There's a deeper truth inside of me... 
 You have placed Your life inside of me 
 So I sing 
 Thank You for healing me 
 I was dying beneath my shame 
 But You brought me to life again, and I will sing 
 Thank You for freeing me 
 I was dead to the truth of You 
 But my healing was in Your wounds, and I will sing 
 Thank You for healing me 
 Oh 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive in You 
 Thank You for healing me 
 Hear Your people sing 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive in You 
 Thank You for healing me 
 Oh 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive in You 
 Thank You for healing me 
 Thank You for healing me, Lord 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive in You 
 I thank You for healing me

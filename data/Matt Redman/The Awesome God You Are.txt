Let Your majesty speak peace to me 
 And chase my fears away 
 To my heart I preach Your sovereignty 
 And the power of Your Name 
 I'll stand in awe of You alone 
 God let hope arise 
 And faith become the fortress of my heart 
 I will lift my eyes 
 And see You as the awesome God You are 
 Believe You as the awesome God You are 
 You're the glory of our brightest days 
 The comfort of our nights 
 When the darkest shades are all we see 
 You're the everlasting light 
 And see You on Your throne so high above 
 See You watching over me in love 
 I will worship You and You alone 
 The awesome God You are 
 The awesome God You are 
 God let hope arise 
 And faith become the fortress of my heart 
 I will lift my eyes 
 And see You as the awesome God You are 
 Believe You as the awesome God You are 
 King Jesus as the awesome God You are 
 We will believe You as the awesome God You are 
 Believe You as the awesome God You are 
 Jesus believe You as the awesome God You are 
 The awesome God You are

The cross has said it all 
 The cross has said it all 
 I can't deny what You have shown 
 The cross speaks of a God of love 
 There displayed for all to see 
 Jesus Christ, our only hope 
 A message of the Father's heart 
 "Come, my children, come on home." 
 As high as the heavens are above the earth 
 So high is the measure of Your great love 
 As far as the east is from the west 
 So far have You take our sins from us 
 As high as the heavens are above the earth 
 So high is the measure of Your great love 
 As far as the east is from the west 
 So far have You take our sins from us 
 The cross has said it all 
 The cross has said it all 
 I never recognised Your touch 
 Until I met You at the cross 
 We are fallen, dust to dust 
 How could You do this for us? 
 Son of God, shed precious blood 
 Who can comprehend this love? 
 As high as the heavens are above the earth 
 So high is the measure of Your great love 
 As far as the east is from the west 
 So far have You take our sins from us 
 As high as the heavens are above the earth 
 So high is the measure of Your great love 
 As far as the east is from the west 
 So far have You take our sins from us 
 How high, how wide, how deep.... 
 How high, how wide, how deep.... 
 How high, how wide, how deep.... 
 How high, how wide, how deep.... 
 How high 
 Amazing love 
 How can it be? 
 That my God would die for me 
 Yeah 
 As high as the heavens are above the earth 
 So high is the measure of Your great love 
 As far as the east is from the west 
 So far have You take our sins from us 
 How high, I can't get over it 
 So high, I can't get over it 
 How high, I can't get over it 
 So high, I can't get over it 
 So powerful love, yeah

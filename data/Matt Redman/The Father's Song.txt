I have heard so many songs 
 Listened to a thousand tongues 
 But there is one that sounds above them all 
 The Father's song, the Father's love 
 You sung it over me 
 And for eternity it's written on my heart 
 Heaven's perfect melody 
 The Creator's symphony 
 You are singing over me 
 The Father's song 
 Heaven's perfect mystery 
 The King of Love has sent for me 
 Now You're singing over me 
 The Father's song 
 I have heard so many songs 
 Listened to a thousand tongues 
 But there is one that sounds above them all (sounds above them all) 
 The Father's song, the Father's love 
 You sung it over me 
 And for eternity it's written on my heart 
 Heaven's perfect melody 
 The Creator's symphony 
 You are singing over me 
 The Father's song 
 Heaven's perfect mystery 
 The King of Love has sent for me 
 And now You're singing over me 
 The Father's song 
 It's Heaven's perfect mystery 
 The King of Love has sent for me 
 Now You're singing over me 
 The Father's song 
 The Father's song 
 The Father's love 
 You've sung it over me 
 And for eternity, it's written on my heart 
 It's written on my heart 
 You sing it over me 
 My heart

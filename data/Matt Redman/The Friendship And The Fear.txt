You confide in those who fear You 
 Share the secrets of Your heart 
 Friendship give to those who seek to 
 Honour You with every part 
 Though I'm one of unclean lips, Lord 
 I am crying "woe is me" 
 Trying now to rid myself of 
 All the things that hinder me from 
 Knowing You 
 Hearing You speak 
 Seeing You move mysteriously 
 Your whisperings 
 In my soul's ear 
 I want the friendship and the fear 
 Of knowing You 
 There is one thing You have spoken 
 There are two things I have found 
 You, O Lord, are ever loving 
 You, O Lord are always strong 
 I am longing to discover 
 Both the closeness and the awe 
 Feel the nearness of Your whisper 
 Hear the glory of Your roar, just... 
 Knowing You 
 Hearing You speak 
 Seeing You move mysteriously, yeah 
 Your whisperings, oh 
 In my soul's ear 
 I want the friendship and the fear 
 I want the friendship and the fear 
 Of knowing You

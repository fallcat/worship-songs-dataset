When the music fades 
 All is stripped away, and I simply come 
 Longing just to bring 
 Something that's of worth 
 That will bless Your heart 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 For a song in itself 
 Is not what You have required 
 You search much deeper within 
 Through the way things appear 
 You're looking into my heart 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You 
 It's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it 
 When it's all about You 
 It's all about You, Jesus 
 King of endless worth 
 No one could express 
 How much You deserve 
 Though I'm weak and poor 
 All I have is Yours, every single breath 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 For a song in itself 
 Is not what You have required 
 You search much deeper within 
 Through the way things appear 
 You're looking into my heart, yeah 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You 
 It's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it 
 When it's all about You 
 It's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 'Cause it's all about You 
 It's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it 
 'Cause it's all about You 
 It's all about You, Jesus 
 All about You 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 More than a song 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 More than a song 
 You're looking into my heart 
 You're looking into my heart 
 You're looking into my heart 
 Into my heart 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 Yeah 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 I'll bring You more than a song

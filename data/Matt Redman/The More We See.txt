Our hearts are breathing in the wonders of Your name 
 And we're breathing out Your praise 
 The more we see, we sing 
 The circle never ends 
 For Your glory never fades 
 And surely as the rising sun 
 Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever 
 From the heights of Your throne 
 To the depths of Your heart 
 Your majesty surrounds us 
 In the power of Your life 
 In the grace of Your cross 
 Your mercy has found us 
 Your power we see displayed 
 In all that You have made 
 In the sky and sea and stars 
 And here beneath Your cross 
 Your mercy speaks so loud 
 Speaking straight into our hearts 
 And surely as the rising sun 
 Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever 
 And the more we see, we sing 
 "Holy is the name of the Lord" 
 And the more we see, we sing 
 "There is no one like You, God" 
 Your majesty surrounds us 
 Your mercy, Lord, has found us 
 There is no one like You, God

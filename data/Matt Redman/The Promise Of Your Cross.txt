Forever in my heart 
 And written on my soul 
 The promise of Your cross 
 I have no other claim 
 I have no other plea 
 The promise of Your cross 
 The hope for every heart 
 Where mercy ever flows 
 And shame's no longer known 
 I'll praise You for the cross 
 The promise of Your cross to me 
 Embedded in my heart 
 And rooted in my soul 
 The promise of Your cross 
 It seals me as Your own 
 And tells me I am Yours 
 The promise of Your cross 
 The hope for every heart 
 Where mercy ever flows 
 And shame's no longer known 
 I'll praise You for the cross 
 The promise of Your cross to me 
 It never fails to bring 
 The cleansing that I need 
 I'll praise You for the cross 
 The promise of Your cross to me 
 Tell it in all the earth 
 Sing it throughout the world 
 The promise of the cross 
 There is a higher way 
 There is a higher hope 
 The promise of Your cross 
 The hope of every heart 
 Where mercy ever flows 
 And shame's no longer known 
 I'll praise You for the cross 
 The promise of Your cross to me 
 It never fails to bring 
 The cleansing that I need 
 I'll praise You for the cross 
 The promise of Your cross to me 
 Thank You, Lord, hey 
 The promise of Your cross 
 I'll praise You for the promise 
 The promise of Your cross

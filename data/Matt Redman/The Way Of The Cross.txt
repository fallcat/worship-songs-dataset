Show me the way of the cross once again 
 Denying myself for the love that I've gained 
 Everything's You now, everything's changed 
 It's time You had my whole life 
 You can have it all 
 Show me the way of the cross once again 
 Denying myself for the love that I've gained 
 Everything's You now, everything's changed 
 It's time You had my whole life 
 You can have it all 
 Yes, I resolve to give it all 
 Some things must die, some things must live 
 Not "what can I gain," but "what can I give" 
 If much is required when much is received 
 Then You can have my whole life 
 Jesus have it all 
 I've given like a beggar but lived like the rich 
 And crafted myself a more comfortable cross 
 Yet what I am called to is deeper than this 
 It's time You had my whole life 
 You can have it all 
 Yes, I resolve to give it all 
 Some things must die, some things must live 
 Not "what can I gain," but "what can I give" 
 If much is required when much is received 
 Then You can have my whole life 
 Jesus have it all 
 Yes, I resolve to give it all 
 Some things must die, some things must live 
 Not "what can I gain," but "what can I give" 
 If much is required when much is received 
 Then You can have my whole life 
 Jesus have it all 
 Have it all 
 Of me 
 You can have it all 
 Jesus 
 Have it all

I'm weak but I'm strong 
 I'm helpless but helped now 
 I'm struggling but I consider it joy 
 For I know that You're with me 
 And You're for me 
 And You didn't just 
 Look down from heaven above 
 But You came down 
 And You found me 
 I surrendered to mercy 
 And gave myself up 
 And I'm finally free 
 And now You're with me 
 The yoke is easy 
 The load is heavy 
 But lighter to bear 
 Now You're with me 
 The yoke is easy 
 The road is narrow 
 But I find You there 
 You are strength for the weak 
 You're the refugee's refuge 
 Open arms at the cross 
 Tell of welcome and love and of rest 
 For the weary and the lonely 
 And they hungry of heart 
 Find a place they can eat 
 And the journey looks costly 
 But to live now is Christ 
 And to die would be gain 
 For I'm heavenly bound

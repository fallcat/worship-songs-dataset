There is a louder shout to come 
 There is a sweeter song to hear 
 All the nations with one voice 
 All the people with one fear 
 Bowing down before Your throne 
 Every tribe and tongue we'll be 
 All the nations with one voice 
 All the people with one King 
 And what a song we'll 
 Sing upon that day 
 O what a song we'll sing 
 And O what a tune we'll bear 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest praise 
 O what a joy will rise 
 And O what a sound we'll make 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest praise 
 Now we see a part of this 
 One day we shall see in full 
 All the nations with one voice 
 All the people with one love 
 No one else will share Your praise, no 
 Nothing else can take Your place 
 All the nations with one voice 
 All the people with one Lord 
 And what a song we'll 
 Sing upon that day, hey 
 O what a song we'll sing 
 And O what a tune we'll bear 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest praise 
 O what a joy will rise 
 And O what a sound we'll make 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest praise 
 Well, it's time we'll sing 
 Even now upon the earth 
 There's a glimpse of all to come 
 Many people with one voice 
 Harmony of many tongues 
 We will all confess Your name 
 You will be our only praise 
 All the nations with one voice 
 All the people with one God 
 And what a song we'll 
 Sing upon this day 
 Oh, what a song we'll sing 
 O what a song we'll sing 
 And O what a tune we'll bear 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest praise 
 O what a joy will rise 
 And O what a sound we'll make 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest praise 
 You deserve the highest praise 
 O what a song we'll sing 
 And O what a tune we'll bear 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest 
 The highest 
 The highest praise 
 O what a joy will rise (what a joy will rise) 
 And O what a sound we'll make 
 You deserve an anthem of 
 The highest praise

Something inside of me 
 Knows there is surely more then this 
 Echoes of eternity all around us 
 Something inside of me 
 Knows there is surely more then this 
 Echoes of eternity all around us 
 There's music within my soul 
 I'm more than these flesh and bones I know 
 Whispers of a destiny deep inside us 
 This beating heart 
 Like a drum it will beat for You 
 This heart like a drum it will beat 
 My soul, my soul sings for You 
 This beating heart 
 I was made I was made for You 
 My God evermore evermore 
 My soul, my soul sings for You 
 We're marked by Your fingerprints 
 There's evidence running through these veins 
 That we are a masterpiece with a Maker 
 Formed in the secret place 
 A mystery born of a love and grace 
 You had a name for me and a purpose 
 This beating heart 
 Like a drum it will beat for You 
 This heart like a drum it will beat 
 My soul, my soul sings for You 
 This beating heart 
 I was made I was made for You 
 My God evermore evermore 
 My soul, my soul sings for You 
 My soul sings for You 
 My life be on Your altar God 
 My every breath exalting You 
 My life be on Your altar God 
 This heart like a drum beating strong for You 
 This beating heart 
 Like a drum it will beat for You 
 This heart like a drum it will beat 
 My soul, my soul sings for You 
 This beating heart 
 I was made I was made for You 
 My God evermore evermore 
 My soul, my soul sings for You 
 Sing my soul sing my soul 
 My soul sings for You

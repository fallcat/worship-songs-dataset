Jesus, this life is for You 
 Everything, Lord that I do 
 Deeds that are pleasing 
 And ways that are pure 
 Lord, make my life bear this fruit 
 This means I love You 
 Singing this song 
 Lord, I don't have the words 
 But I do have the will 
 This means I love You 
 That I take up my cross 
 I will sing as I walk out this love 
 For these are the plans of my heart 
 Yet often I'm missing the mark 
 See my desire to live in Your truth 
 This surely means I love You

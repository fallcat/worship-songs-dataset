Through it all you are faithful 
 Through it all you are strong 
 As we walk through the shadows 
 You walk on. Oh. 
 So many broken promises, God of unbroken promises 
 So many words, always you keep your word 
 God of Love and faithfulness, God of Grace and Holiness 
 Have mercy on the world, Forever to endure 
 You never turn or change 
 You never break the faith 
 Yesterday, Today, Forever 
 Through it all you are faithful 
 Through it all you are strong 
 As we walk through the shadows 
 Still you shine on 
 Still you shine on 
 You are faithful, You never turn or change 
 Jesus you are faithful to the end, You never break the faith 
 You are faithful 
 Jesus you are faithful to the end

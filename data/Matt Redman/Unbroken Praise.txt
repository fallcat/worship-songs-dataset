Praise unbroken 
 Praise unending 
 Be Yours 
 Be Yours forevermore 
 Praise untainted 
 Praise unfading 
 Be Yours 
 Be Yours forevermore 
 Be Yours 
 Be Yours forevermore 
 Unbroken praise be Yours God forever 
 All my praise be Yours God forever 
 Lord take this life 
 Let it become Your throne 
 Unbroken praise be Yours 
 My surrender 
 My devotion 
 Be Yours 
 Be Yours forevermore 
 Be Yours 
 Be Yours forevermore 
 So let my deeds outrun my words 
 And let my life outweigh my songs

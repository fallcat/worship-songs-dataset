We're the forgiven, singing redemption's song 
 There's a fire that burns inside 
 A fire that burns inside 
 Nothing can stop us 
 We'll be running through the night 
 With a fire that burns inside 
 A fire that burns inside 
 We are the free, the freedom generation 
 Singing of mercy 
 You are the One who set us all in motion 
 Yours is the glory 
 There's a fire in our hearts and it burns for You 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 We are the free, and Yours is the glory 
 We are the risen, living alive in You 
 And our passion will not die 
 No, our passion will not die 
 Nothing can stop us 
 We'll be running through the night 
 And our passion will not die 
 No, our passion will not die 
 We are the free, the freedom generation 
 Singing of mercy 
 You are the One who set us all in motion 
 Yours is the glory 
 There's a fire in our hearts and it burns for You 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 We are the free, and Yours is the glory 
 Up from the grave He rose again 
 Up from the grave He rose and we will 
 Rise up, rise up 
 Into the world that You so love 
 Into the world we go and we will 
 Rise up, rise up 
 We are the free, the freedom generation 
 Singing of mercy 
 You are the One who set us all in motion 
 Yours is the glory 
 We are the free, the freedom generation 
 Singing of mercy 
 You are the One who set us all in motion 
 Yours is the glory 
 There's a fire in our hearts and it burns for You 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 There's a fire in our hearts and it burns for You 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 We are the free, and Yours is the glory

You're okay. 
 You'll heal in time. 
 Just catch a train from here down to Mexico and 
 Communicate, but keep in mind 
 The Language isn't all you have to know 
 You might forget, so let's reflect 
 You fell apart like a dying star 
 And in the end, you'll want a friend 
 Someone who's got all the things you're not. 
 Aren't you sick of being down? 
 Don't look away when you're hearing this sound 
 It's the voice you've found 
 And it's trying to tell you. 
 This is how the problem started 
 You have a drink and disintegrate 
 You hit the clubs in search of comfort 
 But no one can give you everything. 
 Don't be afraid and don't regret 
 Anything you've done before now 
 So try to change, evolve again 
 Into something new and from me to you 
 Aren't you sick of being down? 
 Don't look away when you're hearing this sound 
 It's the voice you've found 
 And it's trying to tell you. 
 I know what it is, I'm feeling ya this I guarantee 
 Don't try to fit in 
 Just break the chain 
 Finally finding out, what I'm thinking

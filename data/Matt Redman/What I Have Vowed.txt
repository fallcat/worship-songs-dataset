Lord, I am not my own 
 No longer my own, 
 Living now for You 
 And everything I think 
 All I say and do 
 Is for You, my Lord 
 Now, taking up the cross 
 Walking on Your paths 
 Holding out Your truth 
 Running in this race 
 Bowing every day 
 All for You, my Lord 
 And what I have vowed I will make good 
 Every promise made will be fulfilled 
 'Til the day I die, every day I live 
 Is for You, Is for You, Is for You 
 Is for You, Is for You, Is for You 
 Earth has nothing I desire 
 That lives outside of You 
 I'm consumed with You 
 Treasures have no hold 
 Nothing else will do 
 Only You, my Lord 
 And what I have vowed I will make good 
 Every promise made will be fulfilled 
 'Til the day I die, every day I live 
 Is for You, Is for You, Is for You 
 Is for You, Is for You, Is for You 
 Jesus You, Jesus You, Jesus You, 
 Jesus You, Jesus You, Jesu-us only You, 
 Only You, yeah, only You 
 Jesus You, Jesus You, Jesus You, 
 And what I have vowed I will make good 
 Every promise made will be fulfilled 
 'Til the day I die, every day I live 
 Is for You, for You, for You 
 Jesus You, Jesus You, Just for You 
 And what I have vowed I will make good 
 And every promise made shall be fulfilled 
 Jesus You, Jesus You, Jesus You

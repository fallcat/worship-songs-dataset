Life's too short to be lukewarm 
 This I know, this I know 
 Jesus, You can have it all 
 My every breath 
 My every breath 
 I need Your power to live this life 
 This I know, this I know 
 I can't do this by myself 
 You're Christ in me 
 My only hope 
 My only hope 
 As I walk this broken world 
 Tune my life to heaven's song 
 For I am Yours 
 And when all is said and done 
 Tune my life to heaven's song 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 I need Your power to live this life 
 This I know, this I know 
 I can't do this by myself 
 You're Christ in me 
 My only hope 
 My only hope 
 As I walk this broken world 
 Tune my life to heaven's song 
 For I am Yours 
 And when all is said and done 
 Tune my life to heaven's song 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 Lord, As I walk this broken world 
 Tune my life to heaven's song 
 For I am Yours 
 And when all is said and done 
 Tune my life to heaven's song 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 I just want to sing Your song

Looking back on time, 
 Seeking to remind myself of all Your mercies, 
 I can testify, on every page of life, 
 Your grace just keeps unfolding and unfolding. 
 You made me fruitful in the land of my suffering, Father. 
 You made me hopeful in the place of no hope; 
 Poured oil of gladness on the wounds of my struggling, and You 
 Poured oil of healing on the depths of my soul. 
 When I needed a Saviour, You were there, You were there. 
 When I needed a Healer, You were there, You were there. 
 When I needed a my Father, You were there, You were there, 
 You are here, You are here. 
 Ever since the day 
 I looked upon the cross I've realised Your mercy. 
 For every stage of life, sweet and bitter times, 
 Your love just keeps unfolding, and unfolding. 
 You made me fruitful in the land of my suffering, Father. 
 You made me hopeful in the place of no hope; 
 Poured oil of gladness on the wounds of my struggling, and You 
 Poured oil of healing on the depths of my soul. 
 When I needed a Saviour, You were there, You were there. 
 When I needed a Healer, You were there, You were there. 
 When I needed a my Father, You were there, You were there, 
 You are here, You are here. 
 My Saviour, my Healer, my Father 
 You made me fruitful in the land of my suffering, Father. 
 You made me hopeful in the place of no hope; 
 Poured oil of gladness on the wounds of my struggling, and You 
 Poured oil of healing on the depths of my soul. 
 When I needed a Saviour, You were there, You were there. 
 When I needed a Healer, You were there, You were there. 
 When I needed a my Father, You were there, You were there, 
 You are here, You are here.

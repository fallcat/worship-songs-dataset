When my heart runs dry 
 And there's no song to sing 
 No holy melody 
 No words of love within 
 I recall the height from which 
 This fragile heart has slipped... 
 And I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love of You 
 Lord, I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love of You 
 You are my soul's desire 
 You are the hope within 
 You bring my heart to life 
 You make my spirit sing 
 I recall the height from which 
 This fragile heart has slipped... 
 And I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love of You 
 Lord, I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love of You 
 You are my soul's desire 
 You are the hope within 
 You bring my heart to life 
 You make my spirit sing 
 I recall the height from which 
 This fragile heart has slipped... 
 And I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love of You 
 Lord, I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love, the love of You 
 Lord, I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love of You 
 Lord, I'll remember You 
 I will turn back and do 
 The things I used to do 
 For the love of You 
 I'm turning back to You 
 Repent and do the things I did at first 
 Try and love You with a pure heart 
 Repent and do the things I did at first 
 Follow after You in everything I am 
 Oh 
 Draw me, draw me 
 Jesus 
 I'm coming back to do the things I did at first

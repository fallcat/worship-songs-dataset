If it wasn't for Your mercy 
 If it wasn't for Your love 
 If it wasn't for Your kindness 
 How could I stand? 
 If it wasn't for Your cleansing 
 If it wasn't for Your blood 
 If it wasn't for Your goodness 
 How could I stand? 
 And yet I find myself again 
 Where even angels fear to tread 
 Where I would never dare to come 
 But for the cleansing of Your blood 
 With You there is forgiveness 
 And therefore You are feared 
 Jesus, it's Your loving kindness 
 That brings me to my knees 
 And I find myself again 
 Where even angels fear to tread 
 Where I would never dare to come 
 But for the cleansing of Your blood 
 In the beauty of your holiness 
 Here in the beauty of Your holiness 
 In the beauty of Your holiness 
 In the beauty of Your holiness 
 And I find myself again 
 Where even angels fear to tread 
 Where I would never dare to come 
 But I've been cleansed 
 I've been cleansed by Your blood 
 In the beauty of your holiness 
 Here in the beauty of your holiness 
 In the beauty of your holiness 
 In the beauty of your holiness 
 In the beauty of Your holiness 
 In the beauty of Your holiness... 
 In the beauty of Your holiness...

You came to search and rescue 
 In love, the Father sent You 
 Broke through the darkest night 
 You came to seek and save us 
 You came to liberate us 
 Jesus, You heard our cry 
 Jesus, You heard our cry 
 Where would we be without Your love? 
 We'd still be lost in darkness 
 Where would we be without Your cross? 
 You made a way to save us 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 You are the hope eternal 
 You are the Light of this world 
 Jesus, our rescuer 
 We live our lives to thank You 
 How could we not adore You? 
 Jesus, our rescuer 
 Jesus, our rescuer 
 Where would we be without Your love? 
 We'd still be lost in darkness 
 Where would we be without Your cross? 
 You made a way to save us 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We're safe in the arms of Your embrace 
 We're breathing in Your freedom 
 Lifting a song of highest praise 
 And breathing out Your anthem 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We're singing 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We couldn't escape the sin and the shame 
 That kept us bound 
 We couldn't break through, we couldn't reach You 
 So You reached down 
 Where would we be without Your love? 
 We'd still be lost in darkness 
 Where would we be without Your cross? 
 You made a way to save us 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We're safe in the arms of Your embrace 
 We're breathing in Your freedom 
 Lifting a song of highest praise 
 And breathing out Your anthem 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We're singing 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We're singing 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We keep on singing 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 We're singing 
 Oh, Your love, oh, Your love 
 Jesus, You're the only hope 
 Jesus, hope for all the world

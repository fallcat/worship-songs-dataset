Hands up hearts open wide as the sky 
 We lift You high we lift You high 
 Hands up hearts open wide as we cry 
 God we lift Your name high 
 Let all the other names fade away 
 Let all the other names fade away 
 Until there's only You 
 Let all the other names fade away 
 Jesus take Your place 
 Jesus take Your place 
 Our God 
 We lift You high we lift You high 
 Hands up God we lift Your name high

Who, oh Lord, could save themselves, 
 Their own soul could heal? 
 Our shame was deeper than the sea 
 Your grace is deeper still 
 You alone can rescue, You alone can save 
 You alone can lift us from the grave 
 You came down to find us, led us out of death 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 You, oh Lord, have made a way 
 The great divide You heal 
 For when our hearts were far away 
 Your love went further still 
 Yes, your love goes further still 
 You alone can rescue, You alone can save 
 You alone can lift us from the grave 
 You came down to find us, led us out of death 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 You alone can rescue, You alone can save 
 You alone can lift us from the grave 
 You came down to find us, led us out of death 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes 
 You're the Giver of Life 
 You alone can rescue, You alone can save 
 You alone can lift us from the grave 
 You came down to find us, led us out of death 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 To You alone belongs the highest praise 
 To You alone

Every road, it leads back to… 
 Every road, it leads back to... 
 You led me to the cross 
 And I saw the face of mercy in that place of love 
 You opened up my eyes 
 To believe Your sweet salvation where I'd been so blind 
 Now that I'm living in Your all-forgiving love 
 My every road leads to the cross 
 Jesus, keep me near the cross 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 Saviour, teach me of the cross 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 And there's an empty tomb 
 That tells me of Your resurrection and my life in You 
 The stone lies rolled away 
 Nothing but those folded grave clothes where Your body lay 
 Now that I'm living as a risen child of God, yeah 
 My every road leads to the cross 
 Jesus, keep me near the cross 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 Saviour, teach me of the cross 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 No, no 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 Never to forget the love 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love (Saviour) You've shown 
 I won't forget the love 
 I won't forget the love You've shown 
 My every road leads to the cross 
 Every road, it leads back to… 
 Every road, it leads back to…

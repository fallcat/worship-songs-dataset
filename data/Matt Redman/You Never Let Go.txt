Even though I walk through the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 Your perfect love is casting out fear 
 And even when I'm caught in the middle 
 Of the storms of this life 
 I won't turn back; I know You are near 
 And I will fear no evil 
 For my God is with me 
 And if my God is with me 
 Whom then shall I fear?  Whom then shall I fear? 
 O no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 O no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 O no, You never let go - Lord, You never let go of me 
 And I can see a light that is coming 
 For the heart that holds on 
 A glorious light beyond all compare 
 And there will be an end to these troubles 
 But until that day comes 
 We'll live to know You here on the earth 
 And I will fear no evil 
 For my God is with me 
 And if my God is with me 
 Whom then shall I fear?  Whom then shall I fear? 
 O no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 O no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 O no, You never let go - Lord, You never let go of me 
 Yes, I can see a light that is coming 
 For the heart that holds on 
 And there will be an end 
 To these troubles 
 But until that day comes 
 Still I will praise You 
 Still I will praise You 
 Yes, I can see a light that is coming 
 For the heart that holds on 
 And there will be an end 
 To these troubles 
 But until that day comes 
 Still I will praise You 
 Still I will praise You 
 O 
 O no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 O no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 O no, You never let go - Lord, You never let go of me, yeah 
 O, You never let go, You never let go 
 O no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 O no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 O no, You never let go - Lord, You never let go of me 
 You never let, You never let go 
 You never let go of me

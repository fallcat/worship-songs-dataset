Some see just a wooden cross but 
 I can see the grace of Your redemptive heart 
 Some say this is foolishness but 
 I believe the truth of Your redeeming love 
 And some will say 
 This place belongs to history 
 But I can see, yes, I can see 
 A cross that changes everything 
 And a love that sets the captive free 
 A hope that resurrected me 
 And the power of God 
 For all who believe, I believe 
 As real as the ground beneath my feet and 
 The very air I breathe Your mercy meets me here 
 And here I know the greatness of Your victory 
 Here I know the weight of all Your love for me 
 Oh, some will say this place belongs to history 
 But I can see, yes I can see 
 A cross that changes everything 
 And a love that sets the captive free 
 A hope that resurrected me 
 And the power of God 
 For all who believe 
 I believe 
 This changes everything 
 I believe 
 This changes everything 
 I believe 
 Your cross changes everything 
 Your cross changes everything 
 This changes everything 
 This changes everything 
 Your cross changes everything 
 Your cross changes everything 
 It changes everything

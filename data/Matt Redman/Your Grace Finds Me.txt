It's there in a newborn cry 
 There in the light of every sunrise 
 There in the shadows of this life 
 Your great grace 
 It's there on the mountain top 
 There in the everyday and the mundane 
 There in the sorrow and the dancing 
 Your great grace 
 Oh, such grace 
 From the creation to the cross 
 There from the cross into eternity 
 Your grace finds me 
 Yes, Your grace finds me 
 It's there on the wedding day 
 There in the weeping by the graveside 
 There in the very breath we breathe 
 Your great grace 
 It's the same for the rich and poor 
 The same for the saint and for the sinner 
 Enough for this whole wide world 
 Your great grace 
 Oh, such grace 
 There in the darkest night of the soul 
 There in the sweetest songs of victory 
 Your grace finds me 
 Yes your grace finds me 
 Your great grace 
 Oh such grace 
 Your great grace 
 Oh such grace 
 So I'm breathing in Your grace 
 And breathing out Your praise 
 I'm breathing in Your grace 
 Forever I'll be 
 Your grace finds me 
 Yes Your grace finds me

You have searched me and You know me 
 Familiar with all my ways 
 You have laid Your hand upon me 
 Such knowledge I can't attain 
 Where can I go from Your spirit? 
 Where can I flee from Your presence? 
 If I make my bed in the depths 
 If I go up to the heavens 
 You are there 
 And if I rise on the wings of the dawn 
 If I settle on the far side of the sea 
 Even there Your hand will hold me fast 
 Even there Your hand will guide me 
 'Cause You are there, You are there 
 Oh, oh, yeah 
 You have searched me and You know me 
 Familiar with all my ways 
 You have laid Your hand upon me 
 This knowledge I can't attain 
 Where can I go from Your spirit? 
 Where can I flee from Your presence? 
 If I make my bed in the depths 
 If I go up to the heavens 
 You are there 
 And if I rise on the wings of the dawn 
 If I settle on the far side of the sea 
 Even there Your hand will hold me fast 
 Even there Your hand will guide me 
 You are there, You are there 
 And I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You love me 
 And I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You care 
 And I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You're there 
 And I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You love me 
 And I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You care 
 And I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You're there 
 Well I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You love me 
 I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You care, You care 
 And I will sing, sing a new song 
 Because You're there 
 Oh, because You're there 
 You're there, 'cause You're there

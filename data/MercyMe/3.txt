3:41 AM, make that 3:42 
 Time just keeps rolling on while I'm here stuck like glue 
 So many things cross my mind 
 But nothing stays awhile, so frustrating 
 I just wanna say something worth while, speak through me 
 Say, say what You wanna say, and say it loudly 
 Say, say what You wanna say 
 6:45 AM, man that just can't be right 
 3 hours have gone by and this is all I've got 
 My common sense tells me I should get out the way, so You can speak 
 O Lord, show up or I'll be here all day, speak through me 
 Say, say what You wanna say, and say it loudly 
 Say, say what You wanna say, speak through me 
 If the idea's mine, it's nothing but a waste of time 
 So won't You say, say what You wanna say 
 Say, say what You wanna say 
 Say, say what You wanna say 
 Say, say what You wanna say (say it loudly) 
 Say, say what You wanna say

Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 It's the best time of the year 
 I don't know if there'll be snow 
 But have a cup of cheer 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And when you walk down the street 
 Say hello to friends you know 
 And everyone you meet 
 Ho ho the mistletoe 
 Hung where you can see 
 Somebody waits for you 
 Kiss her once for me 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And in case you didn't hear 
 Oh, by golly 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 This year 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 It's the best time of the year 
 I don't know if there'll be snow 
 But have a cup of cheer 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And when you walk down the street 
 Say hello to friends you know (yohoo) 
 And everyone you meet (oh wait I forgot to give you a hug) 
 Ho ho the mistletoe 
 Hung where you can see 
 Somebody waits for you 
 Kiss her once for me 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And in case you didn't hear 
 Oh, by golly 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 This year 
 Holly jolly, holly jolly, holly jolly 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 Ho ho the mistletoe 
 Hung where you can see 
 Somebody waits for you 
 Kiss her once for me 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And in case you didn't hear 
 Oh, by golly 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 This year 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 It's the best time of the year 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 It's the very best time of the year

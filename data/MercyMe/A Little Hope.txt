Well it's safe to say we've probably never met 
 Even still if a betting man was I I'd bet 
 Every single one of us have found ourselves 
 Standing in the storms of life, soaking wet 
 But do not fret, chin up, my friend 
 A little bit of rain is not how this thing ends 
 But sometimes we forget so if you understand 
 Let me see those hands 
 'Cause everybody needs a little hope 
 You know, the kind that turns your gray skies blue 
 A little something that'll pull you through 
 Well good news, that something's 
 Living right inside of you, yeah, hope 
 It makes you smile when the world says 'don't' 
 It keeps you dancing even when life won't 
 And when the music's gone keep singing 
 'Cause what you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 Now maybe you're thinking, 'yeah, nice try 
 But you don't know me 
 You don't know the things I hide' 
 Well I've walked that road and I've felt that pain 
 We are all the same, yeah 
 Everybody needs a little hope 
 You know, the kind that turns your gray skies blue 
 A little something that'll pull you through 
 Well good news, that something's 
 Living right inside of you, yeah, hope 
 It makes you smile when the world says 'don't' 
 It keeps you dancing even when life won't 
 And when the music's gone keep singing 
 'Cause what you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 Come and you'll find rest 
 This hope is bigger than your regrets 
 So bring your worst, bring your best 
 Oh, let me sing it again 
 Come and you'll find rest 
 This hope is bigger than your regrets 
 So bring your worst, bring your best 
 And all God's people said... 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 Everybody needs a little hope 
 You know, the kind that turns your gray skies blue 
 A little something that'll pull you through 
 Well good news, that something's 
 Living right inside of you, yeah, hope 
 It makes you smile when the world says 'don't' 
 It keeps you dancing even when life won't 
 And when the music's gone keep singing 
 'Cause what you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 And when the music's gone keep singing 
 'Cause what you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 What you've got is hope 
 La la la la la la la la la (ooh-wee-ooh-ooh-hoo) 
 (Ooh? Ha!)

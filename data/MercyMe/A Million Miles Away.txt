My imagination 
 Gets me all the time 
 No matter where I look You're all I'm seeing 
 You're my fascination 
 The very reason why 
 The reason why I'll never stop believing 
 And I'm so amazed that I 
 Am always on Your mind 
 I believe that You're always here with me 
 You're everywhere but still within my reach 
 Cause how could You save the day 
 If You're a million miles away 
 Who's to say what you can't see can't be found 
 There's evidence of Your presence all around 
 Cause how could You save the day 
 If You're a million miles away 
 You're my inspiration 
 You're always by my side 
 You are there as sure as I am breathing 
 Without hesitation 
 I am giving You my life 
 'Cause I know You're never gonna leave me 
 It doesn't matter where I go 
 Cause this I know 
 I believe that You're always here with me 
 You're everywhere but still within my reach 
 Cause how could You save the day 
 If You're a million miles away 
 Who's to say what you can't see can't be found 
 There's evidence of Your presence all around 
 Cause how could You save the day 
 If You're a million miles away 
 What it all comes down to 
 Is being with You 
 I believe... 
 You're everywhere but still within my reach 
 Cause how could You save the day 
 If You're a million miles away 
 Who's to say what you can't see can't be found 
 There's evidence of Your presence all around 
 Cause how could You save the day 
 If You're a million miles away 
 Cause how could You save the day 
 If You're a million miles away

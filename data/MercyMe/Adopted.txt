Hallelujah, God has spoken 
 And I know this changes everything 
 Hallelujah, praise Him only 
 Sing the slaves adopted by the King 
 Glory be to my father who reigns 
 For I met Him and I cannot be the same 
 When in bondage, to Jesus I came 
 He took my place and He changed my name 
 Hallelujah, God has spoken 
 And I know this changes everything 
 Hallelujah, praise Him only 
 Sing the slaves adopted by the King 
 Glory be to my father who reigns 
 For I met Him and I cannot be the same 
 When in bondage, to Jesus I came 
 He took my place and He changed... 
 Glory be to my father who reigns 
 For I met Him and I cannot be the same, yea-eah 
 When in bondage, to Jesus I came 
 He took my place and He changed my name 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, God has spoken 
 And I know this changes everything

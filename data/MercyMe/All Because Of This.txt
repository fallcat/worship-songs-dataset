Why do we do the things we do 
 How can we sing when there seems no reason to 
 How do we smile when there's not much to smile about 
 When the world is down who are we to stand and shout 
 They wonder why we do the things we do 
 It's all because of this 
 It's all because of this 
 We've tasted love, tasted hope, tasted holiness 
 It's all because of this 
 It's all because of this 
 We've tasted love, tasted hope, tasted holiness 
 And they wonder why, we do the things we do

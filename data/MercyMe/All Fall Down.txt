Your word, O Lord, is eternal 
 It stands firm 
 Your faithfulness continues 
 Through all the earth 
 All creation hangs on 
 Your every word 
 With the sound of Your voice 
 Water still, You are Lord over all 
 With the touch of Your robe 
 Sick are healed 
 And for You, Jesus, we all fall down 
 My soul finds rest and comfort 
 From only You 
 My fortress and my rock 
 I won't be moved 
 You are my cornerstone 
 Who's love endures 
 With the sound of Your voice 
 Water still, You are Lord over all 
 With the touch (with the touch) 
 Of Your robe (of Your robe) 
 Sick are healed 
 For You, Jesus, we all fall down 
 And I praise You, for I am 
 Fearfully and wonderfully made 
 And I praise You, for I am 
 Fearfully and wonderfully made 
 With the sound of Your voice 
 Water still, You are Lord over all 
 With the touch (with the touch) 
 Of Your robe (of Your robe) 
 Sick are healed 
 Jesus, we all fall down 
 Water still, You are Lord over all 
 With the touch (with the touch) 
 Of Your robe (of Your robe) 
 Sick are healed 
 For You, Jesus, we all fall down 
 We fall down 
 We fall down, yeah

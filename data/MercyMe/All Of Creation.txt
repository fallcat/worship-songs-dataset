Separated.  Until the veil was torn. 
 The moment that hope was born. 
 And guilt was pardoned once and for all. 
 Captivated.  But no longer bound by chains. 
 Left at an empty grave. 
 The sinner and the sacred resolved. 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Lift up your voice and lay your burden down. 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Fill up the heavens let His glory resound 
 Time has faded and we see Him face to face 
 Every doubt erased forever we will worship the King 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Lift up your voice and lay your burden down. 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Fill up the heavens, let His glory resound. 
 Ohh ah ohhh...ohh ah ohhhâ€¦. 
 The reason we breathe is to sing of His glory and for all He has done. 
 Praise the Father.  Praise the Son.  And the Spirit in One. 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Lift up your voice and lay your burden down. 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Fill up the heavens, let His glory resound. 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Lift your voice and lay your burden down. 
 And all of creation, sing with me now. 
 Let His glory resound 
 And every knee will bow and every tongue. 
 Praise the Father.  Praise the Son.  And the Spirit in One.

Stuck in a day 
 Like a runner with no race 
 Are you afraid 
 Your joy has been misplaced 
 It's been a while 
 Since I've seen you smile 
 How easy you forget 
 So roll back the time 
 And there you will find 
 What never left 
 The day heaven found you 
 The day the angels sang 
 Praises to the Father 
 Who called you by name 
 The moment you surrendered 
 The moment you were saved 
 Life as you knew it 
 Forever was changed 
 And all the above rejoiced 
 Remember the day 
 When God forgot your sin 
 Remember the way 
 That joy came tumbling in 
 There will be times 
 When you cannot find 
 A reason to stand and sing 
 But let this remind 
 You time after time 
 You're a child of the King 
 The day heaven found you 
 The day the angels sang 
 Praises to the Father 
 Who called you by name 
 The moment you surrendered 
 The moment you were saved 
 Life as you knew it 
 Forever was changed 
 And all the above rejoiced 
 See them dancing 
 See them singing 
 All of heaven is rejoicing over you 
 The day heaven found you 
 The day the angels sang 
 Praises to the Father 
 Who called you by name 
 The moment you surrendered 
 The moment you were saved 
 Life as you knew it 
 Forever was changed 
 The day heaven found you 
 The day the angels sang 
 Praises to the Father 
 Who called you by name 
 The moment you surrendered 
 The moment you were saved 
 Life as you knew it 
 Forever was changed 
 And all the above rejoiced

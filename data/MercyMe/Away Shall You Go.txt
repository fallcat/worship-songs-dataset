There's a place where I'm going 
 A place that's fit for a King 
 There's a place where I'm going 
 Where joy defeats suffering 
 I'm known to have no fear 
 When this world tries to swallow me 
 No need to shed those tears 
 Just turn and follow they 
 Away shall you go 
 Leave the crying behind 
 From this world that you know 
 To a peach that's yours to find 
 Away shall you go 
 Like a child in His eyes 
 To a God that loves you so 
 To Heaven you will rise 
 There's a place where I'm going 
 More than these eyes can see 
 There's a place where I'm going 
 That will set my soul free 
 I'm just passing through this place 
 A passenger on this bus ride 
 I'm a victim of His safe embrace 
 Destination: the other side, yeah 
 Away shall you go 
 Leave the crying behind 
 From this world that you know 
 To a peach that's yours to find 
 Away shall you go 
 Like a child in His eyes 
 To a God that loves you so 
 To Heaven you will rise 
 You don't need no money where you're going 
 You don't need no luggage where you're going 
 You don't need nothing, nothing 
 Nothing at all but the love of God 
 But the love of God 
 But the love of God 
 Away shall you go 
 Leave the crying behind 
 From this world that you know 
 To a peach that's ours to find 
 Away shall you go 
 Like a child in His eyes 
 To a God that loves you so 
 To Heaven you will rise 
 Oh, we will rise

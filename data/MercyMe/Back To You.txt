Nobody said it would be easy. 
 Nobody said that life's a breeze. 
 Tossin' and turning oh the wind keeps churnin' 
 Like I'm a little toy boat out on the sea. 
 And if I'm down don't count me out. 
 I'll slowly get back on my feet. 
 Stumbling and fumbling but I keep on coming 
 Just as long as you're not giving up on me. 
 And when I trip, fall. Slow down to a crawl. 
 And feel like I got nothing left to lose. 
 I may slip slide.  And watch our worlds collide. 
 But I will 
 Hit the ground running back to you. 
 There are days my head is spinning. 
 Wishing I could hit the switch and end this ride. 
 If it came to a stop and someone let me off I know 
 I would just get right back in line. 
 And when I trip, fall.  Slow down to a crawl. 
 And feel like I got nothing left to lose. 
 I may slip slide.  And watch our worlds collide. 
 But I will 
 Hit the ground running back to you, yeah, yeah. 
 What kind of love would say. 
 I love you anyway. 
 Oh, time and time again, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all. 
 When I trip, fall.  Slow down to a crawl. 
 And feel like I got nothing left to lose. 
 Well, I may slip slide.  And watch our worlds collide. 
 But I will 
 Hit the ground running back to you and 
 I will 
 Hit the ground running back to you. 
 Oh, I may slip, slide.  And watch our worlds collide. 
 But I will, yes I will 
 Hit the ground running back to you, oh yeah 
 I hit the ground running back to you. 
 I hit the ground.  Crashing down.  Rollin 'round, 
 But I rebound.  I get back up and I'll be found 
 Running, running back to you. 
 I hit the ground.  Crashing down.  Rolling 'round, 
 But I rebound. I get back up and I'll be found 
 Running, running back to you, oh, oh. 
 I'm running back to you, oh. 
 Back to you 
 Back to you 
 Back to you, yeah 
 Running back to you

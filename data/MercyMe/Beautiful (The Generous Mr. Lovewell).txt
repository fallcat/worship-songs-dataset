Days will come when you don't have the strength. 
 When all you hear is, you're not worth anything. 
 Wondering if you ever could be loved. 
 And if they truly saw your heart, they'd see too much. 
 You're beautiful. You're beautiful. 
 You are made for so much more than all of this. 
 You're beautiful.  You're beautiful. 
 You are treasured.  You are sacred. 
 You are His. You're beautiful. 
 Praying that you have the heart to fight. 
 'Cause you are more than what is hurting you tonight. 
 For all the lies you've held inside so long. 
 They are nothing in the shadow of the cross. 
 You're beautiful.  You're beautiful. 
 You are made for so much more than all of this. 
 You're beautiful.  You're beautiful. 
 You are treasured.  You are sacred. 
 You are His.  You're beautiful. 
 Before you ever took a breath. 
 Long before the world began. 
 Of all the wonders He possessed, 
 There was one more precious. 
 Of all the earth and skies above, 
 You're the one He madly loves enough to die. 
 You're beautiful. 
 You're beautiful. 
 In His eyes. 
 You're beautiful. 
 You are made for so much more than all of this. 
 You're beautiful. 
 You are treasured.  You are sacred. 
 You are His.  You're beautiful. 
 You're beautiful. 
 You are made for so much more than all of this. 
 You're beautiful.  You're beautiful. 
 You are treasured.  You are sacred. 
 You are His.

And from the top of the world I will sing 
 Of the joy that flows from my glorious King 
 And in my heart, oh, I can see 
 Your loving arms coming down to me 
 From the top of the world I will sing 
 Of the joy that flows from my glorious King 
 And in my heart, Lord, I can see 
 Your loving arms coming down to me 
 By Your blood that washed over me 
 By Your grace that came down to kiss me 
 You have cleaned my heart and my soul 
 For Your glory You made me 
 Made me beautiful 
 From the top of the world I will sing

Some say, "Don't give up," 
 And hope that your good is good enough 
 Head down, keep on working 
 If you could earn it, you deserve it 
 Some say, "Push on through" 
 After all it's the least that you can do 
 But don't buy, what they're selling 
 It couldn't be further from the truth 
 What if I were the one to tell you 
 That the fight's already been won 
 Well, I think your day's about to get better 
 What if I were the one to tell you 
 That the work's already been done 
 It's not good news 
 It's the best news ever 
 Some say, "Don't ask for help" 
 God helps the ones who help themselves 
 Press on get it right 
 Otherwise get left behind 
 Some say he's keeping score 
 So try hard then try a little more 
 But hold up, if this were true 
 Explain to me what the cross is for 
 What if I were the one to tell you 
 That the fight's already been won 
 Well, I think your day's about to get better 
 What if I were the one to tell you 
 That the work's already been done 
 It's not good news 
 It's the best news ever 
 Best news ever 
 So won't you, come! 
 Come all you weary and you burdened 
 You heavy laden and you hurting 
 For all of you with nothing left 
 Come and find rest! 
 What if I were the one to tell you 
 That the fight's already been won 
 Well, I think your day's about to get better 
 What if I were the one to tell you 
 That the work's already been done 
 It's not good news 
 It's the best news ever! 
 Best news ever... 
 It's not good news 
 It's the best news ever 
 Best news ever 
 It's not good news 
 It's the best news ever!

Why would I want to try and meet You half way 
 Why would I back down when there's still a fight in me 
 Why only give You what I hold in my hands 
 Why would I ever jump with nowhere to land 
 And why surrender if I won't go to my knees 
 I won't just give You the best of me (the best of, the best of me) 
 When You want, cause You want my everything (my every, my everything) 
 Who am I to give You just the pretty things 
 Am I the same as the one who gives You nothing 
 What if nothing was what You chose to do 
 All because the cost was too much for You 
 I can't imagine where I would be 
 I won't just give You the best of me (the best of, the best of me) 
 When You want, cause You want my everything (my every, my everything) 
 Won't You come and take what's left 
 And while You're here take the rest 
 I won't just give You the best of me (the best of, the best of me) 
 Not just my heart 
 But my life too 
 I belong, I belong, 
 I belong to You 
 I won't just give You the best of me (the best of, the best of me) 
 When You want, cause You want my everything (my every, my everything) 
 Won't You come and take what's left 
 And while You're here take the rest 
 I won't just give You the best of me (the best of, the best of me) 
 (My every, my everything) 
 (The best of, the best of me)

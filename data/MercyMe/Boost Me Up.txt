I've been running in circles now 
 I cannot stand up straight 
 I squint so hard to see that now 
 I can't see hand in face 
 I have made my bed 
 I guess it's nap time for me 
 I have scratched the surface, now 
 I'm in a hole too deep 
 I'm tired of being over my head 
 I don't want to sleep just yet 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Boost me up so I can see 
 Hold my hand 
 So I can walk without stumbling 
 Me with You with me 
 Trying to stand my ground, I have 
 I have waved at You 
 Now my wave turns to reaching 
 And I'm reaching for You 
 I own no ground for me to stand 
 On my own 
 On my own, a helpless man 
 Boost me up so I can see 
 Hold my hand, yeah 
 So I can walk without stumbling 
 Me with You with me 
 Boost me up so I can see 
 Hold my hand, yeah 
 So I can walk without stumbling 
 Me with You with me 
 In You I can stand, in You I can see 
 In You I am complete 
 In You I can walk, in You I can run 
 In You I am free 
 Boost me up so I can see 
 Hold my hand 
 So I can walk without stumbling 
 Me with You with me 
 Boost me up so I can see 
 Hold my hand, yeah 
 So I can walk without stumbling 
 Me with You with me 
 Boost me up so I can see You 
 Hold my hand 
 So I can walk without me stumbling 
 It's me with You, it's You with me, yeah 
 It's me with You with me

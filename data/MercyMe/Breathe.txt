This is the air I breathe 
 This is the air I breathe 
 Your holy presence 
 Living in me 
 This is my daily bread 
 This is my daily bread 
 Your very word 
 Spoken to me 
 And I ... I'm desperate for you 
 And I ... I'm lost without you 
 This is air I breathe 
 This is air I breathe 
 Your holy presence 
 Living in me 
 This is my daily bread 
 This is my daily bread 
 Your very word 
 Spoken to me 
 And I ... I'm desperate for you 
 And I ... I'm lost without you (eh hey, yeah) 
 And I ... I'm desperate for you 
 And I ... I'm lost without you 
 And I ... I'm desperate for you 
 And I ... I'm lost without you 
 I'm lost without you 
 I'm lost without you 
 I'm lost without you (Father) 
 I'm lost... without you 
 This is the air I breathe

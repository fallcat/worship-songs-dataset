I can count a million times 
 People asking me how I 
 Can praise You with all that I've gone through 
 The question just amazes me 
 Can circumstances possibly 
 Change who I forever am in You 
 Maybe since my life was changed 
 Long before these rainy days 
 It's never really ever crossed my mind 
 To turn my back on you oh Lord 
 My only shelter from the storms 
 But instead I draw closer through these times 
 So I pray 
 Bring me joy, bring me peace 
 Bring the chance to be free 
 Bring me anything that brings You glory 
 And I know There'll be days 
 When this life brings me pain 
 But if that's what it takes to praise You 
 Jesus Bring the Rain 
 I am Yours regardless of 
 The dark clouds that may loom above 
 Because You are much greater than my pain 
 You who made a way for me 
 By suffering Your destiny 
 So tell me what's a little rain 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord God Almighty

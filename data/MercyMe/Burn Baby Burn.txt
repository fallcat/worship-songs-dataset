And do we know exactly who we are 
 We hold the light but we still listen to the dark 
 And it tells us that we don't measure up 
 And it tells us that we'll never be enough, tell me 
 Do we know exactly who we are 
 We are the light 
 Light of the world 
 Light up the night 
 When will we learn 
 Now is our time 
 Now is our turn 
 To burn baby burn baby 
 Oh oh oh 
 Burn baby burn baby 
 Oh oh oh 
 Burn baby burn baby 
 And do we know exactly what we have 
 Why don't we let it shine while we have the chance 
 It's not so we can earn our place 
 We shine 'cause we've been saved by grace, tell me 
 Do we know exactly what we have 
 We are the light 
 Light of the world 
 Light up the night 
 When will we learn 
 Now is our time 
 Now is our turn 
 To burn baby burn baby 
 Oh oh oh 
 Burn baby burn baby 
 Oh oh oh 
 Burn baby burn baby 
 Oh we're a city on a hillside 
 So bright keep on shining 
 Oh take that fire from the inside 
 Outside keep on burning 
 We are the light 
 Light of the world 
 Light up the night 
 When will we learn 
 Now is our time 
 Now is our turn 
 To burn baby burn baby 
 Oh oh oh 
 Burn baby burn baby 
 Oh oh oh 
 Burn baby burn baby

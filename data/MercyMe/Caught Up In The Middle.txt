I've found a place 
 Where I can finally be a part of the story 
 I've been embraced 
 By the wonderful arms of glory 
 There is nowhere else I'd rather be 
 I believe Your spirit is alive and on the move 
 Oh I want to be caught up in the middle of You 
 I wanna be a part of what I know you're gonna do 
 Oh I wanna be caught up in the middle of You 
 I finally see 
 The very reason for my existence 
 I am complete 
 When I'm standing within Your presence 
 And now I know where I'm supposed to be 
 I believe Your spirit is alive and on the move 
 Oh I want to be caught up in the middle of You 
 I wanna be a part of what I know you're gonna do 
 Oh I wanna be caught up in the middle of You 
 You have called me all along 
 This is right where I belong 
 Caught up in You 
 Caught up in You 
 I believe Your spirit is alive and on the move 
 Oh I want to be caught up in the middle of You 
 I wanna be a part of what I know you're gonna do 
 Oh I wanna be caught up in the middle of You 
 Caught up in the middle 
 Caught up

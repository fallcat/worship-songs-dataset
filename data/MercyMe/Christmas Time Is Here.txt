Christmas time is here 
 Happiness and cheer 
 Fun for all that children call 
 Their favorite time of year 
 Snowflakes in the air 
 Carols everywhere 
 Olden times and ancient rhymes 
 Of love and dreams to share 
 Sleigh bells in the air 
 Beauty everywhere 
 Yuletide by the fireside 
 And joyful memories there 
 Christmas time is here 
 Da da…. 
 Sleigh bells in the air 
 Beauty everywhere 
 Yuletide by the fireside 
 And joyful memories there 
 Christmas time is here 
 We'll be drawing near 
 Oh that we could always see 
 Such spirit through the year 
 Da da…. 
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh...

Has anyone ever noticed 
 See the older you get 
 Time just keeps rolling 
 Moving so fast it makes your whole head spin, yeah 
 Well I need some explaining 
 Where did this year go 
 Just put away the decorations 
 And here we go again we're singing Nat King Cole 
 Don't get me wrong (my heart is full of cheer) 
 I'm doing fine (just wish I could stay right here) 
 Just like the song says (after all this really is) 
 It's the most wonderful time of the year 
 All I'm saying is it feels like a minute ago 
 What was summertime 
 Now has a chance for snow 
 Now embrace every moment, every second my friend 
 I can't believe it's Christmastime again 
 You may wonder where I'm going 
 One day for sure, I know 
 Stop, enjoy the moment 
 Or kiss it goodbye under the mistletoe 
 Santa please if you're listening 
 Since you're taking requests 
 There's only one thing that I'm wishing 
 Can I have a minute just to catch my breath 
 I can't believe it's Christmastime again [x3] 
 I can't believe it's Christmastime

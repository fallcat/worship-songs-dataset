Come you who are weary 
 Come you who are strong 
 Take in His wondrous glory 
 And dance the freedom song 
 Everything revolves here 
 Around His holy name 
 And after you have been here 
 You'll never be the same 
 Come one, come all 
 To the presence of our God 
 This is where all hope and peace and joy are found 
 Come taste and see 
 We've been summoned by the King 
 Enter in and place your feet on holy ground 
 Come you who are searching 
 Come you who are saved 
 Embrace the gift of mercy 
 Embrace the gift of grace 
 Enter all you nations 
 Worship at His throne 
 Glorify the wonder 
 Of Christ and Christ alone 
 Come one, come all 
 To the presence of our God 
 This is where all hope and peace and joy are found 
 Come taste and see 
 We've been summoned by the King 
 Enter in and place your feet on holy ground 
 Yeah 
 We'll shine the light of gloria, yeah 
 We'll shine the light of gloria, yeah 
 Come one, come all 
 To the presence of our God 
 This is where all hope and peace and joy are found 
 Come taste and see 
 We've been summoned by the King 
 Enter in and place your feet on holy ground 
 Come one, come all 
 To the presence of our God 
 This is where all hope and peace and joy are found 
 Come taste and see 
 We've been summoned by the King 
 Enter in and place your feet on holy ground

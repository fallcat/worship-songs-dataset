I'm in way too deep again 
 I've forgotten how to swim 
 I can't tell which way is up or down 
 Save me before I drown down here 
 I just need some air 
 I'm coming up to breathe 
 Oh I'm coming up to breathe 
 I've held my breath for all my life 
 But I am breaking free tonight 
 And I'm coming up to breathe 
 I just need to break these chains 
 I just need to leave this place 
 Before now this was all I knew 
 But with just one glimpse of You I see 
 You're the air I need 
 I've done everything I can 
 To get myself up on dry land 
 Lord here I am again 
 Reaching for Your hand

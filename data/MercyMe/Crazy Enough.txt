Call me crazy.  But what if we learned 
 To love our brother for nothing in return. 
 Oh how the rules would change. 
 Reaching out to the ones who need help. 
 Treating them as you first would treat yourself. 
 Now that would be insane. 
 It may just be crazy enough 
 To work if we could only love. 
 What if we somehow changed the world? 
 It may just be crazy enough. 
 Is it so strange to think that one day 
 We will truly see everyone the same. 
 Oh, could we be so kind.  (Could we be so kind?) 
 To sing along when life's playing their tune. 
 And cry with them when their heart's broken in two. 
 Have I lost my mind? 
 It may just be crazy enough 
 To work if we could only love. 
 What if we somehow changed the world? (Changed the world) 
 It may just be crazy enough. 
 Oh, have I gone mad 
 Believing that love still has a chance? 
 It may just be crazy enough 
 To work if we could only love. 
 What if we somehow changed the world? 
 It may just be crazy enough. 
 It may just be crazy enough 
 What if we could only love. 
 What if we somehow changed the world? 
 It may just be crazy enough. 
 It may just be crazy enough 
 Crazy enough 
 It may just be crazy enough, oh.

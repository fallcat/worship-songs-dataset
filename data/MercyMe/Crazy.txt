Why would I spend my life longing for the day that it would end 
 Why would I spend my time pointing to another man 
 Isn't that crazy 
 How can I find hope in dying with promises unseen 
 How can I learn Your way is better in everything I'm taught to be 
 Isn't that crazy 
 I have not been called to the wisdom of this world 
 But to a God who's calling out to me 
 And even though the world may think 
 I'm losing touch with reality 
 It would be crazy to choose this world 
 Over eternity 
 And if I boast let me boast in filthy rags made clean 
 And if I glory let me glory in my Savior's suffering 
 Isn't that crazy 
 And as I live this daily life I trust You for everything 
 And I will only take a step when I feel You leading me 
 Isn't that crazy 
 I have not been called to the wisdom of this world 
 But to a God who's calling out to me 
 And even though the world may think 
 I'm losing touch with reality 
 It would be crazy to choose this world 
 Over eternity 
 Call me crazy 
 You can call me crazy 
 Call me crazy 
 I have not been called to the wisdom of this world 
 But to a God who's calling out to me 
 And even though the world may think 
 I'm losing touch with reality 
 It would be crazy 
 It would be crazy, yeah 
 It would be crazy to choose this world 
 Over eternity 
 Isn't that crazy 
 You can call me crazy 
 Call me crazy

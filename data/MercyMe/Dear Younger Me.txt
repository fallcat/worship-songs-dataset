Dear younger me 
 Where do I start 
 If I could tell you everything that I have learned so far 
 Then you could be 
 One step ahead 
 Of all the painful memories still running through my head 
 I wonder how much different things would be 
 Dear younger me, dear younger me 
 Dear younger me 
 I cannot decide 
 Do I give some speech about how to get the most out of your life 
 Or do I go deep 
 And try to change 
 The choices that you'll make 'cause they're choices that made me 
 Even though I love this crazy life 
 Sometimes I wish it was a smoother ride 
 Dear younger me, dear younger me 
 If I knew then what I know now 
 Condemnation would've had no power 
 My joy my pain would've never been my worth 
 If I knew then what I know now 
 Would've not been hard to figure out 
 What I would've changed if I had heard 
 Dear younger me 
 It's not your fault 
 You were never meant to carry this beyond the cross 
 Dear younger me 
 You are holy 
 You are righteous 
 You are one of the redeemed 
 Set apart a brand new heart 
 You are free indeed 
 Every mountain every valley 
 Through each heartache you will see 
 Every moment brings you closer 
 To who you were meant to be 
 Dear younger me, dear younger me 
 You are holy 
 You are righteous 
 You are one of the redeemed 
 Set apart a brand new heart 
 You are free indeed 
 You are holy 
 You are righteous 
 You are one of the redeemed 
 Set apart a brand new heart 
 You are free indeed 
 You are holy 
 You are righteous 
 You are one of the redeemed 
 Set apart a brand new heart 
 You are free indeed

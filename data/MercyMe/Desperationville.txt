Well this town's gone crazy 
 Where they talk about love 
 It seems they've gotten lazy 
 Answers just 'all the above' 
 There is no restitution 
 No effort to find what they have lost 
 Only desiring tainted solutions 
 To avoid the actual cost 
 Oh, you can almost hear them 
 Their silent screams coming through 
 How can our Father forgive us 
 When we've never been introduced? 
 Will somebody tell them? 
 There is a love burning in the dark 
 A love that's like no other 
 Saying, 'come as you are' 
 This town needs a hero 
 But will they welcome Him? 
 That in hope is less than zero 
 It's just another day in Desperationville 
 No one answers to no one 
 Or so their stubborn minds think 
 This town's just a loaded gun 
 Bang! Before an eye can blink 
 Everyone's pointing fingers 
 'Don't look at me if it goes wrong' 
 They're all heartbroken singers 
 Singing the same old sad songs 
 Oh, you can almost hear them 
 Their silent screams coming through 
 How can our Father forgive us 
 When we've never been introduced? 
 Oh, this town needs a hero 
 But will they welcome Him? Oh 
 Well that in hope is less than zero 
 It's just another day in Desperationville, yeah 
 Somebody tell them 
 There is a love burning in the dark 
 A love that's like no other 
 Saying, 'come as you are' in Desperationville 
 In Desperationville 
 Welcome to, to Desperationville 
 Ooohh, oh, oh

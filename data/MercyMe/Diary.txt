Day one, drifting out at sea 
 No sign of land, no sign of hope for me 
 Rocking to and fro by the waves of complacency 
 I'm just so tired of fighting to breathe 
 Day two or day six, day twenty, day fifty 
 They're all the same, nothing changes for me 
 When will I ever be rescued? 
 When will I ever be free? 
 Oh, God, someone hear me, someone, please, yeah 
 But wait, oh, but wait, there's a man 
 Walking above all of this that surrounds me 
 He takes my hand, takes my heart, rips me free 
 Rips me free, rips me free, rips me free 
 How can I ever repay You, mister? 
 For setting my desperate soul on dry land 
 For sending those storms away with a whisper 
 For taking all of my burdens in Your hands 
 In Your hands, in Your hands 
 Today things have most certainly changed 
 All of my pain for all God's hope exchanged 
 When will I ever be rescued? 
 That was my desperate plea 
 And God, You heard me and set me free 
 How can I ever repay You, mister? 
 For setting my desperate soul on dry land 
 For sending those storms away with a whisper 
 For taking all of my burdens in Your hands 
 In Your hands, in Your hands 
 How can I ever repay You, mister? 
 For setting my desperate soul on dry land 
 For sending those storms away with a whisper 
 For taking all of my burdens 
 All of my burdens in Your hands

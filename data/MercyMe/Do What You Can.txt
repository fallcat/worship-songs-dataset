TV shows the famine over there 
 We see all the problems they have over there 
 It takes our minds off the things that go on here 
 It takes our minds off the burdens so near 
 Admiration for the ones over there 
 They spread the love of God over there 
 You say to yourself, 'I wish they were here' 
 Look in your heart, isn't it clear? 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Look in your own little world 
 And find hearts that ache 
 So do what you can for God's sake 
 I'm not a preacher man 
 I never said you were 
 I'm not one to change the whole world 
 I never said you were 
 You may not think there's much you can do 
 Do what you can, that's all He asks of you 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Look in your own little world 
 And find hearts that ache 
 So do what you can for God's sake 
 If everybody thought the little things 
 We did had no meaning 
 And never took the time to reach out 
 Where would we be? 
 Who knows? 
 You may not think there's much you can do 
 Do what you can, that's all He asks of you 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Look in your own little world 
 And find hearts that ache 
 So do what you can for God's sake 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Do what you can for God's sake 
 Just look in your own little world 
 And find hearts that ache 
 And do what you can for God's sake

Said the night wind to the little lamb 
 Do you see what I see 
 Way up in the sky little lamb 
 Do you see what I see 
 A star, a star 
 Dancing tonight 
 With a tail as big as a kite 
 With a tail as big as a kite 
 Said the little lamb to the Shepard boy 
 Do you hear what I hear 
 Ringing through the sky Shepard boy 
 Do you hear what I hear 
 A song, a song 
 High above the trees 
 With a voice as big as the sea 
 With a voice as big as the sea 
 Said the Shepard boy to the mighty king 
 Do you know what I know 
 In your palace wall mighty king 
 Do you know what I know 
 A child, a child 
 Shivers in the cold 
 Let us bring him silver and gold 
 Let us bring him silver and gold 
 Can you hear the song of love ringing through the night, this baby's cry 
 Can you see that hope has come when you look inside this baby's eyes 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 God is with us 
 Said the king to the people everywhere 
 Listen to what I say 
 Pray for peace people everywhere 
 Listen to what I say 
 The child, the child 
 Sleeping in the night 
 He will bring us goodness and light 
 He will bring us goodness and light

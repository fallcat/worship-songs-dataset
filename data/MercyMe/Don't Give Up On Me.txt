Will You find me no matter where I am 
 Will You forgive time and time again 
 I feel like a child wondering 
 It's hard to believe, to comprehend 
 That You would love me in the state I'm in 
 When I'm falling 
 When I'm falling down 
 When it's all stripped away 
 When my world comes crashing 
 Crashing down 
 Will You still be with me 
 Who am I You'd even say my name 
 Within the same the same breath as grace 
 You cross every bridge I have burned 
 You reach for me when it's undeserved 
 When I'm falling 
 When I'm falling down 
 When it's all stripped away 
 When my world comes crashing 
 Crashing down 
 Will You still be with me 
 Oh don't give up on me 
 Oh don't give up on me 
 Be still I'll never leave you 
 When you're far I am near 
 My grace will always be greater 
 Than the sum of all your fears 
 Be still I'll never leave you 
 When you're far I am near 
 My grace will always be greater 
 Than the sum of all your fears 
 When I'm falling 
 When I'm falling down 
 When it's all stripped away 
 When my world comes crashing 
 Crashing down 
 Will You still be with me 
 Oh don't give up on me (don't give up, don't give up on me) 
 Oh don't give up on me (don't give up, don't give up on me) 
 When I'm falling down (don't give up, don't give up on me) 
 You don't give up, don't give up on me

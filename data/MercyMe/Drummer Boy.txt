Come they told me pa rum pum pum pum 
 A newborn King to see pa rum pum pum pum 
 Our finest gifts we bring pa rum pum pum pum 
 To lay before the King pa rum pum pum pum 
 Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum 
 So to honor Him pa rum pum pum pum 
 When we come 
 Little Baby pa rum pum pum pum 
 I am a poor boy too pa rum pum pum pum 
 I have no gift to bring pa rum pum pum pum 
 That's fit to give the King pa rum pum pum pum 
 Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum 
 Shall I play for you pa rum pum pum pum 
 On my drum 
 Shall I play for you shall I play for you 
 Mary looked at me and nodded 
 The ox and lamb kept time 
 Oh I played my drum for Him 
 Oh I played my best for Christ 
 I played my best for Christ 
 Then He smiled at me

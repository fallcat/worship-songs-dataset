They say sometimes you win some 
 Sometimes you lose some 
 And right now, right now I'm losing bad 
 I've stood on this stage night after night 
 Reminding the broken it'll be all right 
 But right now, oh right now I just can't 
 It's easy to sing 
 When there's nothing to bring me down 
 But what will I say 
 When I'm held to the flame 
 Like I am right now 
 I know You're able and I know You can 
 Save through the fire with Your mighty hand 
 But even if You don't 
 My hope is You alone 
 They say it only takes a little faith 
 To move a mountain 
 Well, good thing 
 A little faith is all I have right now 
 But God, when You choose 
 To leave mountains unmovable 
 Give me the strength to be able to sing 
 It is well with my soul 
 I know You're able and I know You can 
 Save through the fire with Your mighty hand 
 But even if You don't 
 My hope is You alone 
 I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt 
 Would all go away if You'd just say the word 
 But even if You don't 
 My hope is You alone 
 You've been faithful, You've been good 
 All of my days 
 Jesus, I will cling to You 
 Come what may 
 'Cause I know You're able 
 I know You can 
 I know You're able and I know You can 
 Save through the fire with Your mighty hand 
 But even if You don't 
 My hope is You alone 
 I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt 
 Would all go away if You'd just say the word 
 But even if You don't 
 My hope is You alone 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well, it is well with my soul

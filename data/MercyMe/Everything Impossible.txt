I was taught to be practical in everything I do 
 Holding on to what is tangible, and then came You 
 That's when I found myself so far away, from everything I knew 
 I took a leap of faith 
 Even though You're difficult for me to explain 
 I know I'll never be the same 
 You're everything I cannot see 
 You're everything I cannot say 
 I know it all seems so illogical 
 But that's okay 
 You're the love You give to me 
 You're the love I give away 
 You are everything impossible 
 And that's okay 
 That's okay! 
 All the things that make no sense to me, draw me to You 
 Like finding freedom by surrendering, can it be true 
 With everything I can and cannot know 
 This mystery is bringing life to me 
 And all this love I have for You I can't contain 
 I know I'll never be the same 
 You're everything I cannot see 
 You're everything I cannot say 
 I know it all seems so illogical 
 But that's okay 
 You're the love You give to me 
 You're the love I give away 
 You are everything impossible 
 And that's okay 
 That's okay 
 What's so hard to understand 
 What I cannot comprehend 
 Is that You love me the way I am 
 You're everything I cannot see 
 You're everything I cannot say 
 I know it all seems so illogical 
 But that's okay 
 You're the love You give to me 
 You're the love I give away 
 You are everything impossible 
 And that's okay 
 You're everything I cannot see 
 You're everything I cannot say 
 I know it all seems so illogical 
 But that's okay 
 You're the love You give to me 
 You're the love I give away 
 You are everything impossible 
 And that's okay 
 And that's okay

I don't have to know you 
 To know that you will go through hard times 
 It's just part of life 
 Don't let that moment blind you 
 And don't let it define you 
 Take heart, that's not who you are 
 Our god is able, more than capable 
 And to be faithful until the end 
 Of it has finally started 
 No matter what you've done 
 Grace comes like a flood 
 There's hope to carry on 
 He'll finish what he started 
 No matter what you face 
 His mercy will not change 
 He's with you all the way 
 He'll finish what he started 
 Remember you're forgiven 
 So there's no need to give 
 Into the light, you're qualified 
 Our god is able, more than capable 
 And to be faithful until the end 
 Of it has finally started 
 No matter what you've done 
 Grace comes like a flood 
 There's hope to carry on 
 He'll finish what he started 
 No matter what you face 
 His mercy will not change 
 He's with you all the way 
 He'll finish what he started 
 This world can started in the now 
 His faith is now completed 
 A promise we'll see when he cried out 
 It is finished 
 No matter what you've done 
 Grace comes like a flood 
 There's hope to carry on 
 He'll finish what he started 
 No matter what you face 
 His mercy will not change 
 He's with you all the way 
 He'll finish what he started

There's got to be more 
 Than going back and forth 
 From doing right to doing wrong 
 'Cause we were taught that's who we are 
 Come on get in line right behind me 
 You along with everybody 
 Thinking there's worth in what you do 
 Then Like a hero who takes the stage when 
 We're on the edge of our seats saying it's too late 
 Well let me introduce you to amazing grace 
 No matter the bumps 
 No matter the bruises 
 No matter the scars 
 Still the truth is 
 The cross has made 
 The cross has made you flawless 
 No matter the hurt 
 Or how deep the wound is 
 No matter the pain 
 Still the truth is 
 The cross has made 
 The cross has made you flawless 
 Could it possibly be 
 That we simply can't believe 
 That this unconditional 
 Kind of love would be enough 
 To take a filthy wretch like this 
 And wrap him up in righteousness 
 But that's exactly what He did 
 No matter the bumps 
 No matter the bruises 
 No matter the scars 
 Still the truth is 
 The cross has made 
 The cross has made you flawless 
 No matter the hurt 
 Or how deep the wound is 
 No matter the pain 
 Still the truth is 
 The cross has made 
 The cross has made you flawless 
 Take a breath smile and say 
 Right here right now I'm ok 
 Because the cross was enough 
 Then Like a hero who takes the stage when 
 We're on the edge of our seats saying it's too late 
 Well let me introduce you to grace grace 
 God's grace 
 No matter the bumps 
 No matter the bruises 
 No matter the scars 
 Still the truth is 
 The cross has made 
 The cross has made you flawless 
 No matter the hurt 
 Or how deep the wound is 
 No matter the pain 
 Still the truth is 
 The cross has made 
 The cross has made you flawless 
 No matter what they say 
 Or what you think you are 
 The day you called His name 
 He made you flawless 
 He made you flawless 
 No matter the bumps 
 No matter the bruises 
 No matter the scars 
 Still the truth is 
 The cross has made 
 The cross has made you flawless

I look around, inside these four walls. 
 And I can see this is not my home. 
 Can you hear it now?  From inside these stone walls 
 My heart cries out 'I'm not where I belong'. 
 No matter what they do, 
 My heart belongs to You. 
 I am free. 
 Oh the hands that hold the world have set me free. 
 He has broken every chain 
 So I lift my hands up to the One who saves. 
 Oh….. 
 Take me captive.  You can lock me away, 
 But my debt is already paid. 
 Take me prisoner, but I will not fear. 
 'Cause my Deliverer is already here. 
 No matter what they do, 
 My heart belongs to You. 
 I am free. 
 Oh the hands that hold the world have set me free. 
 He has broken every chain 
 So I lift my hands up to the One who saves. 
 Oh…. 
 This world can have its way. 
 Nothing can stop Your glory. 
 What may become of me. 
 I'll overcome 
 Because I am free. 
 Oh the hands that hold the world have set me free. 
 He has broken every chain 
 So I lift my hands up to the One who saves. 
 And I lift my hands up to the One who saves. 
 Oh... 
 And I am free 
 Oh these chains won't hold me 
 And I am free

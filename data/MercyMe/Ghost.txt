There's a ghost 
 There's a ghost inside of me 
 Not like those drips in ol' bedsheets 
 Saying "trick or treat" 
 Different 
 Oh this ghost is different 
 Not one that leaves me scared to death 
 But one that puts my fear to rest 
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Holiness keep haunting me 
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
 You're my hope, You're my peace 
 Ironic in a way 
 I'm no longer afraid 
 And the ghost is to blame 
 There's a ghost 
 There's a ghost inside of me 
 Not something from some campfire story 
 Where I'm terrified to sleep 
 Opposite 
 This ghost is quite the opposite 
 He came just like a welcomed friend 
 I was comforted 
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Holiness keep haunting me 
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
 You're my hope, You're my peace 
 Ironic in a way 
 I'm no longer afraid 
 And the ghost is to blame 
 I'm not afraid 
 I'm not afraid! 
 No longer afraid 
 Lead me through the darkness 
 Lead me through the unknown 
 Oh-oh, lead me 
 Holy Ghost 
 Lead me through the darkness 
 Lead me through the unknown 
 Oh-oh, lead me 
 Holy Ghost 
 Lead me through the darkness 
 Lead me through the unknown 
 Oh-oh, lead me 
 Holy Ghost 
 Lead me through the darkness 
 Lead me through the unknown 
 Oh-oh, lead me 
 Holy Ghost

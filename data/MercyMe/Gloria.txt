Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains, 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains. 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 What the gladsome tidings be 
 Which inspire your heavenly song? 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 Christ whose birth the angels sing; 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ the Lord, the newborn King. 
 See Him in a manger laid, 
 Whom the choirs of angels praise; 
 Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, 
 While our hearts in love we raise 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
 How could heaven's heart not break 
 On the day, the day that You came 
 Salvation's reason to celebrate 
 On the day, the day that You came 
 How could heaven's heart not break 
 On the day, the day that You came 
 Salvation's reason to celebrate 
 On the day, the day that You came 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
 Gloria, gloria, gloria 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

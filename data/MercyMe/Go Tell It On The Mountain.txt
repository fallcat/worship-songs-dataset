Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 While shepherds kept their watching 
 Over silent flocks by night 
 Behold throughout the heavens 
 There shone a holy light 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 Down in a lowly manger 
 Our humble Christ was born 
 And God send us salvation 
 That blessed Christmas morn 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born 
 He is born 
 He is born 
 Go, tell it on the Mountain

My life has been instilled 
 By a hope that never moves 
 And yet it moves me still 
 So I'm crying out to You 
 Use me 
 So I can take Your fame and glory 
 For all to see 
 No matter where Your hand may lead me 
 I will go 
 I will go 
 To make You known 
 I will go 
 I can't keep You to myself 
 My heart is just too small 
 There's so many left to tell 
 That You came for one and all 
 Use me 
 So I can take Your fame and Glory 
 For all to see 
 No matter where Your hand may lead me 
 I will go 
 I will go 
 To make You known 
 I will go 
 For a dying world in need 
 For the hungry and the weak 
 For the sinner scared to speak 
 I will go 
 I will go 
 I will go 
 To make You known 
 I will go

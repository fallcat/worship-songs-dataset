God rest ye merry, gentlemen, 
 Let nothing you dismay, 
 Remember Christ our Savior 
 Was born on Christmas Day, 
 To save us all from Satan's power 
 When we were gone astray. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy! 
 From God our heavenly Father 
 A blessed angel came, 
 And unto certain shepherds 
 Brought tidings of the same, 
 How that in Bethlehem was born 
 The Son of God by name. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy! 
 Joy to the world 
 For Christ the Lord has finally come 
 Let every heart receive the newborn King 
 O come all of heaven and nature sing 
 Hark! how the bells 
 Sweet silver bells 
 All seem to say, 
 "throw cares away." 
 Christmas is here 
 Bringing good cheer 
 To young and old 
 Meek and the bold 
 Tidings of comfort and joy 
 Hark! how the bells 
 Sweet silver bells 
 All seem to say, 
 "throw cares away." 
 Christmas is here 
 Bringing good cheer 
 To young and old 
 Meek and the bold 
 Tidings of comfort and joy 
 Hark! how the bells 
 Sweet silver bells 
 All seem to say, 
 "throw cares away." 
 Christmas is here 
 Bringing good cheer 
 To young and old 
 Meek and the bold 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy; 
 O tidings of comfort and joy! 
 O how happy are their tones 
 Gaily they ring 
 Telling a tale 
 While people sing 
 Songs of good cheer 
 Christmas is here

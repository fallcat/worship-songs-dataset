Who are we 
 That You would be mindful of us 
 What do You see 
 That's worth looking our way 
 We are free 
 In ways that we never should be 
 Sweet release 
 From the grip of these chains 
 Like hinges straining from the weight 
 My heart no longer can keep from singing 
 All that is within me cries 
 For You alone be glorified 
 Emmanuel ... God with us 
 My heart sings a brand new song 
 The debt is paid these chains are gone 
 Emmanuel ... God with us 
 Lord ... You know 
 Our hearts don't deserve Your glory 
 Still You show 
 A love we cannot afford 
 Like hinges straining from the weight 
 My heart no longer can keep from singing 
 Such a tiny offering 
 Compared to Calvary 
 But nevertheless 
 We lay it at your feet 
 Such a tiny offering 
 Compared to Calvary 
 But nevertheless 
 We lay this at your feet

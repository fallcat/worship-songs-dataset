I wonder when we first bought into this so satisfied with status quo have we convinced 
 Ourselves that this is all there is well all that is within me says we were meant to break 
 Free. 
 Live like there's no tomorrow love extravagantly lead a life to be followed goodbye ordinary 
 Goodbye ordinary 
 We were never meant to compromise settle for mediocrity this life was never made to b a waste 
 Of time well all that is within me says no more just existing. [back to chorus] 
 No more complacency no more just settling this time goodbye to atrophy for we were meant to be 
 Alive. 
 (Back to chorus)

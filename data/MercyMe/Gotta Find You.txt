There's a whistle from the hole in my heart 
 The wind is blowing so cold 
 Once filled by what since has departed 
 Same story's getting old 
 I'll try anything to satisfy my heart 
 But anything will not do 
 It's gotta be You 
 It's gotta be You 
 It's the same old song, it's just the same old dance 
 If one goes wrong we'll take another chance 
 This didn't work, well maybe that'll win 
 We keep searching until our heart gets filled 
 Our heart gets filled, now 
 Hit the road headed for somewhere 
 From a nowhere that I came 
 To find out it's no different there 
 My fears are still the same 
 All my answers in of this way 
 But this one's not excused 
 I've gotta find You 
 I've gotta find You 
 It's the same old song, it's just the same old dance 
 If one goes wrong we'll take another chance 
 This didn't work, well maybe that'll win 
 We keep searching until our heart gets filled 
 Our heart gets filled, now 
 Our heart gets filled 
 Our heart gets filled again, yeah 
 To wait on God is to struggle and sometimes to fail. Sometimes the failures teach us more than the successes. For the failures teach us that to wait on God is not only to wait for His mercy, but to wait by His mercy. The glory hidden in our failures is the glory that the very thing we wait for is what we wait by. The success of our waiting lies not in who we are, but in who God is. It is not our strength that will pull us through to the end. It's God's amazing grace and God's mercy. 
 It's the same old song, it's just the same old dance 
 If one goes wrong we'll take another chance 
 This didn't work, well maybe that'll win 
 We keep searching until our heart gets filled 
 Our heart gets filled, now 
 Our heart gets filled 
 Our heart gets filled, now, now, now 
 Oh, God, won't You, won't You fill our heart?

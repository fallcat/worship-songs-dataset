Brand new 
 Is that person in the mirror looking back at you 
 It's true 
 But you can't see it 'cause you're stuck on what you've been through 
 You got that white knuckle, red faced 
 Kung fu grip on all your chains 
 But that's not who are 
 I'm here to let you know 
 You gotta let it go 
 You were made for something more 
 So come on and let it go 
 Oh oh oh 
 Tell me why 
 You'd think that you deserve a life of just getting by 
 You are alive 
 Stop taking flowers to the grave of the old you that died 
 If God can take your sin and free ya 
 Forget just like amnesia 
 Why are you holding on 
 I'm here to let you know 
 You gotta let it go 
 You were made for something more 
 So come on and let it go 
 Oh oh oh 
 I'm here to let you know 
 You gotta let it go 
 You were made for something more 
 So come on and let it go 
 Oh oh oh 
 You gotta let it go 
 I'm here to let you know 
 You gotta let it go 
 You gotta let it go 
 I'm here to let you know 
 You gotta let it go 
 You gotta let it go

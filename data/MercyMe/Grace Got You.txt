Have you ever met those who 
 Keep humming when the song's through? 
 It's like 
 They're living life to a whole different tune 
 And have you ever met those that 
 Keep hoping when it's hopeless 
 It's like 
 They figured out what the rest haven't yet 
 The second when you realize 
 What you have inside 
 It's only just a matter of time 
 'Til you... 
 Sing, so the back row hears you 
 Glide, 'cause walking just won't do 
 Dance, you don't have to know how to 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Laugh, 'til your whole side's hurting 
 Smile, like you just got away with something 
 Why? 
 'Cause you just got away with something 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 So when you're standing in the rain again 
 You might as well be dancing 
 Why? 
 'Cause there ain't no storm that can change how this ends 
 So next time when you feel blue 
 Don't let that smile leave you 
 Why? 
 'Cause you have every reason just to... 
 Sing, so the back row hears you 
 Glide, cause walking just won't do 
 Dance, you don't have to know how to 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Laugh, 'til your whole side's hurting 
 Smile, like you just got away with something 
 Why? 
 'Cause you just got away with something 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Grace got you 
 (Bridge: John Reuben) 
 Got away with something, bubbling inside of you 
 Spilling over 'cause your life is full, how incredible 
 Undeniable, monumental like the Eiffel 
 Uncontrollable, let the joy flow through, ha-ha 
 Giddy oh but pretty pretty please 
 Let me see your hands in the air with you out your seats 
 Warm it up, let go, shout it out, celebrate 
 When you can't articulate, just say Amazing Grace 
 The second when you realize 
 What you have inside 
 It's only just a matter of 
 (only just a matter of) 
 It's only just a matter of... 
 (only just a matter of) 
 Time! 
 'Til you... 
 Sing, so the back row hears you 
 Glide, 'cause walking just won't do 
 Dance, you don't have to know how to 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Laugh, 'til your whole side's hurting 
 Smile, like you just got away with something 
 Why? 
 'Cause you just got away with something 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Yeah-yea, yea-yea-yea-yea 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Yeah-yea, yea-yea-yea-yea 
 Grace got you 
 Yeah-yea, yea-yea-yea-yea 
 Ever since, ever since 
 Grace got you 
 Yeah-yea, yea-yea-yea-yea 
 Grace got you 
 Yeah-yea, yea-yea-yea-yea 
 Yeah-yea, yea-yea-yea-yea 
 Grace got you...

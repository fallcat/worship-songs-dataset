They say don't waste your time You simply cannot find an ounce of good within the heart of man 
 They say we've got to lay in the bed we've made and live this life without a second chance but 
 I'm inclined to say there must be something more. 
 We've been told that the heart is just too far gone to save but grace tells us another story 
 Where glory sends hopelessness away oh grace tells us another story. 
 They say we cannot change there is no other way get used to it cause this is all there is they 
 Say don't raise your voice 'cause we don't have a choice we're dealt this hand so learn to live 
 With it well I have to believer there must something more. [back to chorus] 
 And though we may not understand why You'd give us another chance we praise You who lets us 
 Start again. [back to chorus]

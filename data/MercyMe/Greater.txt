Bring your tired 
 And bring your shame 
 Bring your guilt 
 And bring your pain 
 Don't you know that's not you're name 
 You will always be much more to me 
 Every day I wrestle with the voices 
 That keep telling me I'm not right 
 But that's all right 
 'Cause I hear a voice and He calls me redeemed 
 When others say I'll never be enough 
 And greater is the One living inside of me 
 Than he who is living in the world 
 In the world 
 In the world 
 And greater is the One living inside of me 
 Than he who is living in the world 
 Bring your doubts 
 And bring your fears 
 Bring your hurt 
 And bring your tears 
 There'll be no condemnation here 
 You are holy, righteous and redeemed 
 Every time I fall 
 There'll be those who will call me 
 A mistake 
 Well that's OK 
 'Cause I hear a voice and He calls me redeemed 
 When others say I'll never be enough 
 And greater is the One living inside of me 
 Than he who is living in the world 
 In the world 
 In the world 
 And greater is the One living inside of me 
 Than he who is living in the world 
 (He's Greater, He's Greater) 
 There'll be days I lose the battle 
 Grace says that it doesn't matter 
 'Cause the cross already won the war 
 He's Greater, He's Greater 
 I am learning to run freely 
 Understanding just how He sees me 
 And it makes me love Him more and more 
 He's Greater, He's Greater 
 There'll be days I lose the battle 
 Grace says that it doesn't matter 
 'Cause the cross already won the war 
 He's Greater, He's Greater 
 I am learning to run freely 
 Understanding just how He sees me 
 And it makes me love Him more and more 
 He's Greater, He's Greater 
 'Cause I hear a voice and He calls me redeemed 
 When others say I'll never be enough 
 And greater is the One living inside of me 
 Than he who is living in the world 
 In the world 
 In the world 
 And greater is the One living inside of me 
 Than he who is living in the world 
 There'll be days I lose the battle 
 Grace says that it doesn't matter 
 'Cause the cross already won the war 
 He's Greater, He's Greater 
 I am learning to run freely 
 Understanding just how He sees me 
 And it makes me love Him more and more 
 My God is greater (He's Greater, He's Greater) 
 Than he who is living in the world

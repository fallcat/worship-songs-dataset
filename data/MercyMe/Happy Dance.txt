Hey, you 
 In the corner shaking in those boots 
 You got one, one for two 
 You got the shaking right, but the fear won't do 
 We always say that we have unspeakable joy 
 So let our feet do all the talking when our words fall short 
 We've got reason to get up 
 Reason to get down 
 He done traded our sin for joy 
 And now, that joy wants out 
 Happy dance 
 (oh!) 
 Happy dance 
 (oh!) 
 Hey, yeah you 
 In the back of the room with those concrete shoes 
 It's okay, to cut loose 
 Oh, it ain't about how you move, but what moves you 
 We're so consumed with what we think we're supposed to be 
 That we stop living like we know that we're free 
 We've got reason to get up 
 Reason to get down 
 He done traded our sin for joy 
 And now, that joy wants out 
 Happy dance 
 (oh!) 
 Happy dance 
 (oh!) 
 Let me see, those hands 
 If the good Lord saved ya 
 Get up, get down 
 'Cause He done changed ya 
 Let me see, those hands 
 If the good Lord saved ya 
 Get up, get down 
 'Cause He done changed ya! 
 We've got reason to get up 
 Reason to get down 
 He done traded our sin for joy 
 And now, that joy wants out 
 Happy dance 
 (oh!) 
 Happy dance 
 (oh!)

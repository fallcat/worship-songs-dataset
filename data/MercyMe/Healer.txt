I'm gonna wrap my arms around my daddy's neck 
 And tell him that I've missed him 
 And tell him all about the man that I became 
 And hope that it pleased him 
 There's so much I want to say 
 There's so much I want you to know 
 When I finally make it home 
 When I finally make it home 
 Then I'll gaze upon the throne of the King 
 Frozen in my steps 
 And all the questions that I swore I would ask 
 Words just won't come yet 
 So amazed at what I've seen 
 So much more than this old mind can hold 
 When I finally make it home 
 When I finally make it home 
 And the sweetest sound my ears have yet to hear 
 Voices of the angels 
 When I finally make it home 
 When I finally make it home

All I knew, how the this all goes 
 Tryn' to get through life 
 Till you get called home 
 Then came you 
 Heaven has begun 
 Eternity is now 
 Not when this life's done 
 Hallelujah, sing like the angels do 
 We don't have to wait till this life is through 
 No separation, He has raised us up 
 We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 I say, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 Make no mistake, trust Me I know 
 There's a place waiting 
 That we'll call home 
 But there ain't no hurry 
 It's all been prepared 
 Life is much sweeter 
 Knowing I'm already there 
 Hallelujah, sing like the angels do 
 We don't have to wait till this life is through 
 No separation, He has raised us up 
 We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 I said, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 I say, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 What are we waiting for? 
 If we're honest 
 Together forever in Christ 
 Is the promise 
 Oh heaven has started 
 Oh heaven has started 
 Oh heaven has started 
 Sing heaven has started 
 Hallelujah, sing like the angels do 
 We don't have to wait till this life is through 
 No separation, He has raised us up 
 We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 I say, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 Heaven's here! 
 We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 Heaven's here! 
 We don't have to wait, heaven's here with us 
 I said, we don't have to wait, heaven's here with us...

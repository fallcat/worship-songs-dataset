No more 
 I quit 
 I've had enough 
 I wasn't made for this 
 To all the lies that have tried 
 To cripple me with doubt 
 I think it's time to say goodbye 
 I know who I am now 
 Part of me says I'd be 
 Smart to walk away 
 But before I leave, I think I need 
 To call you out by name 
 Goodbye regret 
 Goodbye alone 
 Goodbye to emptiness 
 Say hello to beautiful 
 Goodbye afraid 
 Goodbye ashamed 
 Goodbye to hopelessness 
 Say hello to beautiful 
 Can you hear it 
 That's the sound of me walking out 
 Of this prison cell 
 That I've come to know so well 
 I used to play the victim, singing 
 Take these chains from me 
 But they have long been broken 
 I was free and would not leave 
 Somehow I got too comfortable 
 Locked up here in this prison 
 That I missed the doors wide open 
 More like ripped off of its hinges 
 Goodbye regret 
 Goodbye alone 
 (Goodbye) 
 Goodbye to emptiness 
 Say hello to beautiful 
 (Beautiful) 
 Goodbye afraid 
 Goodbye ashamed 
 Goodbye to hopelessness 
 Say hello to beautiful 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful 
 Before I go, just so you know 
 There will come days again 
 Wrestling not to believe 
 The things you say I am 
 When I've forgotten what's inside 
 And who I'm meant to be 
 I remember what's inside 
 Has not forgotten me 
 Goodbye regret 
 Goodbye alone 
 Goodbye to emptiness 
 Say hello to beautiful 
 Goodbye afraid 
 Goodbye ashamed 
 Goodbye to hopelessness 
 Say hello to beautiful 
 (To beautiful) 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful 
 (Beautiful) 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful 
 Hello, hello, hello beautiful

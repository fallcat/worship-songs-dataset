On the other side of the world 
 She stands on the ocean shore 
 Gazing at the heavens, she wonders 
 'Is there something more' 
 Never been told the name of Jesus 
 She turns and walks away 
 What a shame, oh yeah 
 Just across the street in your hometown 
 Leaving from his nine to five 
 Gazing down the road, he wonders 
 'Is this all there is to life' 
 Never been told the name of Jesus 
 He continues on his way 
 What a shame, oh yeah 
 Whom shall I send? 
 Who will go for me? 
 To the ends of the earth 
 Who will rise up for the King? 
 Here am I, send me 
 Here am I, send me 
 Whether foreign land or neighbors 
 Everyone's the same 
 Searching for the answers 
 That lie within Your name 
 I wanna proclaim the love of Jesus 
 In all I do and say 
 Unashamed, oh yeah 
 Whom shall I send? 
 Who will go for me? 
 To the ends of the earth 
 Who will rise up for the King? 
 Here am I, send me 
 Here am I, send me 
 How beautiful are the feet 
 Of those who bring good news 
 Proclaiming pace and Your salvation 
 Whom shall I send? 
 Who will go for me? 
 To the ends of the earth 
 Who will rise up for the King? 
 Here am I, send me 
 Here am I, send me 
 Here am I, send me

I long for your embrace 
 Every single day 
 To meet you in this place 
 And see you face to face 
 Will you show me? 
 Reveal yourself to me 
 Because of your mercy 
 I fall down on my knees 
 And I can feel your presence here with me 
 Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty 
 Caught up in the wonder of your touch 
 Here in this moment I surrender to your love 
 You're everywhere I go 
 I am not alone 
 You call me as your own 
 To know you and be known 
 You are holy 
 And I fall down on my knees 
 I can feel your presence here with me 
 Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty 
 Caught up in the wonder of your touch 
 Here in this moment I surrender to your love 
 I surrender to your grace 
 I surrender to the one who took my place 
 I can feel your presence here with me 
 Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty 
 Caught up in the wonder of your touch 
 Here in this moment I surrender 
 I can feel your presence here with me 
 Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty 
 Caught up in the wonder of your touch 
 Here in this moment I surrender to your love

Why should I feel discouraged? 
 Why should the shadows come? 
 And why should my heart be lonely 
 And long for Heaven and home? 
 When Jesus is my portion 
 My constant friend is He 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know He watches me 
 And I sing because I'm happy 
 I sing because I'm free 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know He watches me 
 Let not your heart be troubled 
 His tender word I hear 
 And resting on His goodness 
 I lose my doubts and fears 
 Though by the path He leadeth 
 But one step I may see 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know He watches me 
 (Ooh) 
 (Ooh) 
 (Ooh) 
 (Ooh) 
 I sing because I'm happy 
 I sing because I am free 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know He watches me 
 Oh-oh, His eye is on the sparrow 
 And I know He watches me 
 He watches me

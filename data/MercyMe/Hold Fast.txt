To everyone who's hurting 
 To those who've had enough 
 To all the undeserving 
 That should cover all of us 
 Please do not let go 
 I promise there is hope 
 Hold fast 
 Help is on the way 
 Hold fast 
 He's come to save the day 
 What I've learned in my life 
 One thing greater than my strife 
 Is His grasp 
 So hold fast 
 Will this season ever pass 
 Can we stop this ride 
 Will we see the sun at last 
 Or could this be our lot in life 
 Please do not let go 
 I promise you there's hope 
 You may think you're all alone 
 And there's no way that anyone could know 
 What you're going through 
 But if you only hear one thing 
 Just understand that we are all the same 
 Searching for the truth 
 The truth of what we're soon to face 
 Unless someone comes to take our place 
 Is there anyone 
 All we want is to be free 
 Free from our captivity Lord 
 Here He comes

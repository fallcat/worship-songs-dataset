The colder it gets outside 
 The more it warms my soul 
 Christmas is on my mind 
 I just gotta make it home 
 It won't be long till I am singing 
 To the rhythm of the Salvation Army bell ringing 
 But this road keeps going for miles and miles 
 Oh please get me there on time 
 Hold on Christmas 
 I'm begging you please 
 Hold on Christmas 
 Christmas wait for me 
 For me 
 Tell Santa to take his time 
 Don't be in such a rush 
 Just give me a chance 
 So I can get there before he does 
 I gotta see my baby and hold her hand 
 While we're watching It's A Wonderful Life again 
 It's the only present I need right now 
 So please could you help me out 
 Gifts beneath the tree 
 Kids pretend to sleep 
 It's finally Christmas Eve 
 So keep the fire bright 
 Don't turn out the light 
 I'll be home tonight

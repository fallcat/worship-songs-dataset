Ever have those times 
 When you feel so small 
 On a starry night 
 As you stand in awe 
 Have you climbed 
 To the mountain's edge 
 And the world you find 
 Makes you catch your breath 
 If you think that this 
 Is the best that it can get 
 Oh the wonder of it is 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 Just hold on 
 Hold on 
 It's the butterflies 
 When she says I do 
 And a baby's cry 
 In a world brand new 
 It's the arms 
 That are holding you 
 And the moment when 
 All your dreams come true 
 If you think that this 
 Is the best that it can get 
 Oh the wonder of it is 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 The sweetest sound 
 Yet to be heard 
 Still you know you want to hear it more 
 Oh we long 
 Long to return 
 To a home we've never seen before 
 If you think that this 
 Is the best that it can get 
 Oh the wonder of it is 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 If you think that this 
 Is the best that it can get 
 Oh the wonder of it is 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 Just hold on 
 Hold on 
 Hold on...

Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 As we bow before Your throne 
 Majesty and honor to You alone 
 Majesty and honor to You alone 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 As we bow before Your throne 
 Majesty and honor to You alone 
 Majesty and honor to You alone 
 No longer will we give our hearts 
 To the things of this world 
 For a debt of love we will offer to You 
 We look for the day when every knee will bow 
 We will join with the angels around Your throne 
 And we will sing... 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord

 Holy is the Lord 
 As we bow before Your throne 
 Majesty and honor to You alone 
 Majesty and honor to You alone 
 No longer will we give our hearts 
 To the things of this world 
 For a debt of love we will offer to You 
 We look for the day when every knee will bow 
 We will join with the angels around Your throne 
 And we will sing...

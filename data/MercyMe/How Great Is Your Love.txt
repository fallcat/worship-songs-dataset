My heart is steadfast, O God 
 And I will sing 
 With all my heart and soul 
 Music for the King 
 And will awake the dawn 
 With my praise to You, O Lord 
 How great is Your love (how great is Your love) 
 So much higher than the heavens 
 With faithfulness that reaches the sky 
 How great is Your love 
 So much higher than the heavens 
 With faithfulness that reaches the sky 
 Oh, how great is Your love 
 Oh, yeah 
 Praise the Lord, O my soul 
 And glory to the King 
 Forever You are robed with majesty 
 We come to You, O Lord 
 And lay our praise at Your feet 
 How great is Your love (how great is Your love) 
 So much higher than the heavens 
 With faithfulness that reaches the sky 
 How great is Your love 
 So much higher than the heavens 
 With faithfulness that reaches the sky 
 Be exalted, O God 
 And let Your glory reign 
 Be exalted, O God 
 And let Your glory reign 
 Let it reign, let it reign 
 Let it reign 
 Oh, let it reign, let it reign 
 Let it reign 
 How great is Your love (how great is Your love) 
 So much higher than the heavens 
 With faithfulness that reaches the sky 
 How great is Your love 
 So much higher than the heavens 
 With faithfulness that reaches the sky

I can only imagine what it will be like 
 When I walk by Your side 
 I can only imagine what my eyes will see 
 When Your face is before me 
 I can only imagine 
 I can only imagine 
 Surrounded by Your glory 
 What will my heart feel? 
 Will I dance for You, Jesus? 
 Or in awe of You be still? 
 Will I stand in Your presence? 
 Or to my knees will I fall? 
 Will I sing hallelujah? 
 Will I be able to speak it all? 
 I can only imagine 
 I can only imagine 
 I can only imagine when that day comes 
 When I find myself standing in the Son 
 I can only imagine when all I will do 
 Is forever, forever worship You 
 I can only imagine 
 I can only imagine 
 Surrounded by Your glory 
 What will my heart feel? 
 Will I dance for You, Jesus? 
 Or in awe of You be still? 
 Will I stand in Your presence? 
 Or to my knees will I fall? 
 Will I sing hallelujah? 
 Will I be able to speak it all? 
 I can only imagine, yeah 
 I can only imagine 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Surrounded by Your glory

 Will I be able to speak it all?

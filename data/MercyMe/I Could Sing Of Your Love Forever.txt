Over the mountain to the sea 
 Your river runs with love for me 
 And I will open up my heart 
 And let the Healer set me free 
 I'm happy to be in Your truth 
 And I will daily lift my hands 
 For I will always sing 
 Of when Your love came down 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 Over the mountain to the sea 
 Your river runs with love for me 
 And I will open up my heart 
 And let the Healer set me free 
 I'm happy to be in Your truth 
 And I will daily lift my hands 
 For I will always sing 
 Of when Your love came down 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 I could sing of Your love forever 
 Yeah, yeah, forever 
 Oh, yeah, yeah 
 Over the mountain to the sea 
 Your river runs with love for me 
 And I will open up my heart 
 And let the Healer set me free

I heard the bells on Christmas Day 
 Their old familiar carols play 
 And wild and sweet the words repeat 
 Of peace on earth good will to men 
 And thought how as the day had come 
 The belfries of all Christendom 
 Had rolled along the unbroken song 
 Of peace on earth good will to men 
 I can hear them 
 I can hear them 
 I can hear them 
 I can hear them 
 Oh... 
 And in despair I bowed my head 
 There is no peace on earth I said 
 For hate is strong and mocks the song 
 Of peace on earth good will to men 
 Then pealed the bells more loud and deep 
 God is not dead nor does He sleep 
 The wrong shall fail the right prevail 
 With peace on earth good will to men 
 I can hear You 
 I can hear You 
 I can hear You 
 I can hear You 
 I can hear You 
 I can hear You 
 Ohâ€¦. 
 I could still hear You 
 I can hear You 
 The world can hear You 
 I can hear You loud 
 I can hear You loud 
 I can hear You loud 
 I can hear You loud

This one's for Maw maw and Ruby. 
 All to Jesus I surrender 
 All to Him I freely give 
 I will ever love and trust Him 
 In His presence daily live 
 And I surrender all 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all 
 All to Jesus I surrender 
 Humbly at His feet I bow 
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken 
 Take me, Jesus, take me now 
 And I surrender all 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all 
 All to Jesus I surrender 
 Lord, I give myself to Thee 
 Fill me with Thy love and power 
 Let Thy blessing fall on me 
 And I surrender all 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all 
 And I surrender all 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all 
 All to Thee my blessed Savior 
 I surrender all

I've been walking with a big grin 
 Singing with my eyes closed 
 Lifting up my hands 
 I've been lost in the moment 
 Sending up praises 
 Now I think I understand 
 When I open up and let it flow 
 I feel Your touch and then I know... 
 I can never live without it 
 And I'm never gonna doubt it 
 Everyday it's new, yeah 
 There's nothing any better 
 I'll be singing it forever 
 I worship You 
 I'm standing on the edge now 
 Looking to a new place 
 Going deeper still 
 The feeling is electric 
 The power and the glory 
 Just move me where You will 
 'Cause You take the song and make it fly 
 Into my soul and that is why... 
 I can never live without it 
 And I'm never gonna doubt it 
 Everyday it's new, yeah 
 There's nothing any better 
 I'll be singing it forever 
 I worship You 
 I just wanna dive into Your grace 
 I wanna feel Your presence 
 Seek Your face 
 I just wanna be where You are 
 I can never live without it 
 And I'm never gonna doubt it 
 Every day is new, yeah 
 I can never live without it 
 And I'm never gonna doubt it 
 Everyday it's new, yeah 
 There's nothing any better 
 I'll be singing it forever 
 I worship You

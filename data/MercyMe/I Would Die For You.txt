And I know that I can find You here 
 Cause You promised me You'll always be there 
 Times like these it's hard to see 
 But somehow I have a peace... You're near 
 And I pray that you will use my life 
 In whatever way Your name is glorified 
 Even if surrendering 
 Means leaving everything... behind 
 My life has never been this clear 
 Now I know the reason why I'm here 
 You never know why you're alive 
 Until you know what you would die for 
 I would die for you 
 And I know I don't have much to give 
 But I promise You I will give You all there is 
 Can I possibly do less 
 When through Your own death... I live 
 No Greater love is found 
 Than of those who lay their own lives down 
 As sure as I live and breathe 
 I know what it means to be free

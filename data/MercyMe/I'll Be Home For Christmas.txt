It's a quarter till midnight on Christmas eve and this next song goes out to all those loved ones who can't quite make it home this holiday season. Wherever you are have a very merry Christmas. 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 You can plan on me 
 Please have snow and mistletoe 
 And presents on the tree 
 Christmas Eve will find me 
 Where the love light gleams 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 If only in my dreams 
 I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love 
 Even more than I usually do 
 And although I know it's a long road home 
 I promise you 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 You can plan on me 
 Please have snow and mistletoe 
 And presents on the tree 
 Christmas Eve will find me 
 Where the love light gleams 
 I'll be home for Christmas 
 If only in my dreams 
 If only in my dreams

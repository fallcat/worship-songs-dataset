When I can not feel 
 When my wounds don't heal 
 Lord, I humbly kneel, hidden in You 
 Lord You are my life 
 So I don't mind to die 
 Just as long as I'm hidden in You 
 If I could just sit with You awhile 
 If You could just hold me 
 Nothing can touch me 
 Though I'm wounded, though I've died 
 If I could Just sit with You awhile 
 I'd need You to hold me 
 Moment by moment till forever passes by

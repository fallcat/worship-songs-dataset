Hands reaching out of me 
 Wanting something more 
 Pressure squeezing me 
 What am I looking for? 
 There's gotta be someone 
 Who can keep me from alone 
 Searching for a vacancy 
 That I can call my home 
 I cannot make it on my own 
 I'll scream it till my voice is gone 
 I cannot make it without You 
 Nothing can take Your place 
 Lord, do You hear me? 
 Does my voice reach You? 
 Lord, can You see me? 
 Or am I out of view? 
 I have tried everything 
 That I know to fulfill me 
 All systems are shut down 
 Time for surrendering, yeah 
 I cannot make it on my own 
 I'll scream it till my voice is gone 
 I cannot make it without You 
 Nothing can take Your place 
 I cannot make it on my own 
 I'll scream it till my voice is gone 
 I cannot make it without You 
 Nothing can take Your place 
 And every time I take the reigns 
 My vision of You starts to fade 
 My life is under Your control 
 'Cause I can't make it on my own 
 And every time I take the reigns 
 My vision of You starts to fade 
 My life is under Your control 
 'Cause I can't make it on my own 
 My own, my own, my own 
 I cannot make it on my own 
 I'll scream it till my voice is gone 
 I cannot make it without You 
 Nothing can take Your place 
 I cannot make it on my own 
 I'll scream it till my voice is gone 
 I cannot make it without You 
 Nothing can take Your place

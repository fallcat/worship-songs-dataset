You put me here for a reason 
 You have a mission for me 
 You knew my name and You called it 
 Long before I learned to breathe 
 Sometimes I feel disappointed 
 By the way I spend my time 
 How can I further Your kingdom 
 When I'm so wrapped up in mine 
 In a Blink of an eye that is when 
 I'll be closer to You than I've ever been 
 Time will fly, but until then 
 I'll embrace every moment I'm given 
 There's a reason I'm alive for a blink of an eye 
 And though I'm living a good life 
 Can my life be something great? 
 I have to answer the question 
 Before it's too late 
 Cause in a Blink of an eye that is when 
 I'll be closer to You than I've ever been 
 Time will fly, but until then 
 I'll embrace every moment I'm given 
 There's a reason I'm alive for a blink of an eye 
 If I give the very best of me 
 That becomes my legacy 
 So tell me what am I waiting for? 
 What am I waiting for? 
 In a Blink of an eye that is when 
 I'll be closer to You than I've ever been 
 Time will fly, but until then 
 I'll embrace every moment I'm given 
 In a Blink of an eye that is when 
 I'll be closer to You than I've ever been 
 Time will fly, but until then 
 I'll embrace every moment I'm given 
 There's a reason I'm alive for a blink of an eye

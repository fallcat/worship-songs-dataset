In the secret, in the quiet place 
 In the stillness You are there 
 In the secret, in the quiet hour 
 I wait only for You 
 'Cause I want to know You more 
 In the secret, in the quiet place 
 In the stillness You are there 
 In the secret, in the quiet hour 
 I wait only for You 
 'Cause I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 I am reaching for the highest goal 
 That I might receive the prize 
 Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside 
 Out of my way 
 'Cause I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 In the secret, in the quiet place 
 In the stillness You are there 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more, yeah

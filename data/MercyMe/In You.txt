And I put my hope in You 
 And I lay my life in the palm of Your hand 
 For I'm constantly drawn to You, O Lord 
 In ways I cannot comprehend 
 It's the Creator calling the created 
 The Maker beckoning the made 
 The bride finding what she's always waited for 
 When we find ourselves that day 
 In You, where the hungry feast at the table 
 The blind frozen by colors in view 
 The lame will dance 
 They'll dance for they are able 
 And the weary find rest 
 Oh, the weary find rest in You 
 And it's no secret that we don't belong here 
 Those set apart by the grace of You 
 We look for the day when we go to a place 
 Where the old becomes brand new 
 In You, where the hungry feast at the table 
 The blind frozen by colors in view 
 The lame will dance 
 They'll dance for they are able 
 And the weary find rest 
 Oh, the weary find rest in You 
 Where the hungry feast at the table 
 The blind frozen by colors in view 
 The lame will dance 
 They'll dance for they are able 
 And the weary find rest 
 Oh, we will find rest in You

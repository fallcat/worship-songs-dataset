It came upon the midnight clear, 
 That glorious song of old, 
 From angels bending near the earth, 
 To touch their harps of gold: 
 Still through the cloven skies they come 
 With peaceful wings unfurled, 
 And still their heavenly music floats 
 O'er all the weary world; 
 "Peace on the earth, good will to men, 
 From heaven's gracious King." 
 Yet with the woes of sin and strife 
 The world has suffered long 
 Beneath the blessed angel strain have rolled 
 Two thousand years of wrong 
 "Peace on the earth, good will to men, 
 From heaven's gracious King." 
 O hush the noise ye men of strife 
 And hear the angels sing 
 "Peace on the earth, good will to men, 
 From heaven's gracious King." 
 The world in solemn stillness lay, 
 To hear the angels' song. 
 To hear the angels' song.

Whatever life may bring, it's all right 
 I'm a child of the King, it's all right 
 That's the reason I sing, it's all right 
 I will never be the same 
 'Cause I'm covered by Your name 
 Your glorious name, Jesus 
 Your grace has set me free 
 And given me a peace 
 Beyond understanding, Jesus 
 Yeah, yeah 
 There'll be hard times I know, it's all right 
 Let Your glory be shown, and it's all right 
 You remain on Your throne, and it's all right, yeah 
 I will never be the same 
 'Cause I'm covered by Your name 
 Your glorious name, Jesus 
 Your grace has set me free 
 And given me a peace 
 Beyond understanding, Jesus 
 Even though I'm unworthy, it's all right 
 By Your blood I am holy, it's all right 
 I will never be the same (never be the same) 
 'Cause I'm covered by Your name (covered by Your name) 
 Your glorious name, Jesus 
 Your grace has set me free (grace has set me free) 
 And given me a peace (given me a peace) 
 Beyond understanding, Jesus 
 I will never be the same (never be the same) 
 'Cause I'm covered by Your name, yeah (covered by Your name)

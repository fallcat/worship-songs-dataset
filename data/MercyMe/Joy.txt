Joy to the world 
 The Lord is come 
 Let earth receive her King 
 Let every heart prepare Him room 
 And heaven and nature sing 
 And heaven and nature sing 
 Oh come let us adore Him 
 Oh come let us adore Him 
 He rules the world with truth and grace 
 And makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders of His love 
 Oh come let us adore Him 
 Oh come let us adore Him 
 Let no sins and sorrows grow 
 Nor thorns infest the ground 
 He makes His blessings flow 
 Far as the curse is found 
 Far as the curse is found 
 Far as, far as the curse is found 
 Rejoice the Savior reigns 
 Let us our songs employ 
 While fields and floods 
 Rocks, hills and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Glory in the highest 
 Holiness has become like us 
 To be like Him 
 And so begins 
 (x2) 
 Emmanuel, Emmanuel 
 God with us 
 Oh come let us adore Him 
 Oh come let us adore Him 
 (x2)

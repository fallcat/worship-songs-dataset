Believe me when I say 
 You look familiar in a certain way 
 Believe me when I say 
 I think I met You some other day 
 There's something about You that I can see 
 And it shines right through You 
 And approaches me 
 Oh, but now I know 
 Oh yes, I know 
 You're just like Your father 
 You got Your daddy's ways 
 You walk so close to Him 
 Picked up His traits 
 You're just like Your Father 
 You got Your Daddy's ways 
 Just like the man I met 
 When I was saved 
 You're just like Your Father 
 You got Your daddy's eyes 
 You got Your daddy's hands 
 You got Your daddy's smile 
 Got Your daddy's plans 
 Before You speak people know 
 Who You belong to, it's how much it shows 
 I can see the love of God from the start 
 First thing I noticed, He's got Your heart 
 Oh, but now I know 
 Oh yes, I know 
 You're just like Your father 
 You got Your daddy's ways 
 You walk so close to Him 
 Picked up His traits 
 You're just like Your Father 
 You got Your Daddy's ways 
 Just like the man I met 
 When I was saved 
 You're just like Your father 
 You have got something, a satisfying peace 
 He dwells within you, so many long to see 
 You're just like Your father 
 You got Your daddy's ways 
 You walk so close to Him 
 Picked up His traits 
 You're just like Your Father 
 Got Your Daddy's ways 
 Just like the man I met 
 When I was saved 
 You're just like Your father 
 You got Your daddy's ways 
 You walk so close to Him 
 Picked up His traits 
 You're just like Your Father 
 You got Your Daddy's ways 
 Just like the man I met 
 When I was saved 
 You're just like You father 
 You're just like You father 
 You're just like You father 
 You're just like You father 
 You're just like You father

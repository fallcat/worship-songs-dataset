Another rainy day 
 I can't recall having sunshine on my face 
 All I feel is pain 
 All I wanna do is walk out of this place 
 But when I am stuck and I can't move 
 When I don't know what I should do 
 When I wonder if I'll ever make it through 
 I gotta keep singing 
 I gotta keep praising Your name 
 Your the one that's keeping my heart beating 
 I gotta keep singing 
 I gotta keep praising Your name 
 That's the only way that I'll find healing 
 Can I climb up in Your lap 
 I don't wanna leave 
 Jesus sing over me 
 I gotta keep singing 
 Can I climb up in Your lap 
 I don't wanna leave 
 Jesus sing over me 
 I gotta keep singing 
 Oh You're everything I need 
 And I gotta keep singing

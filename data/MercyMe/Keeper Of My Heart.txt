When the mighty rivers flow I see You 
 With every drop of rain Your grace in view 
 In all of creation Your glory's shown 
 But only in my heart do You call home 
 And I worship You, I worship You 
 For only in my heart do You call home 
 Keeper of my heart, faithfully see 
 This air of praise Your children bring 
 Keeper of my heart, faithfully see 
 This air of praise Your children bring 
 When the mighty rivers flow I see You 
 With every drop of rain Your grace in view 
 In all of creation Your glory's shown 
 But only in my heart do You call home 
 And I worship You, I worship You 
 For only in my heart do You call home 
 Keeper of my heart, faithfully see 
 This air of praise Your children bring 
 Keeper of my heart, faithfully see 
 This air of praise Your children bring 
 And I worship You, I worship You 
 For only in my heart do You call home 
 Keeper of my heart, faithfully see 
 This air of praise Your children bring 
 Keeper of my heart, faithfully see 
 This air of praise Your children bring 
 This air of praise Your children bring 
 This air of praise Your children bring

Don't you count me 
 Out 'cause I've fallen 
 Out 'cause I've fallen down 
 I have landed 
 Down on my knees oh 
 Down on my knees again 
 This is where I'll find the strength to carry on 
 This is where I'll find the strength to stand 
 I'm gonna be the last one standing 
 Fighting for something much bigger than me 
 I'm gonna be the last one standing here 
 Clear the way for 
 One who is worthy 
 One who is worthy of 
 All my praise He's 
 Already finished 
 Already finished strong 
 I have seen the way this story's going to end 
 I have seen who's already won 
 The last one standing wants it more 
 Finding there's something worth fighting for 
 We're gonna be the last one standing here

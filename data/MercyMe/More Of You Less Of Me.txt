No more searching for me 
 Gone are the days of wandering aimlessly 
 My eyes are fixed on the one who set me free 
 No more searching for me, yeah, yea-yeah 
 No more feeling alone 
 Gone are the days of being on my own 
 My eyes are fixed on the one who's calling me home 
 No more feeling alone 
 Jesus, You're everything I'll ever need 
 All of You and no more of me 
 Jesus, You're everything I'll ever need 
 All of You and no more of me

If I could only throw 
 One thing past your way 
 It'd be that you know 
 That Jesus loves you 
 If there was just one thing 
 That I could sing to you 
 It'd be that you know 
 That Jesus loves you 
 Well He's the most important thing yesterday 
 Well He's the most important thing to come 
 Well He's the most important thing today, yeah 
 Yeah-ea-eah, oh yeah 
 Above all other things (above all other things) 
 This world has to give 
 There's just one thing that saves (just one thing) 
 'Cause Jesus loves you 
 Stop looking over time (stop looking over time) 
 For someone who will care 
 Is standing right beside you (standing right beside you) 
 'Cause Jesus loves you 
 Well He's the most important thing yesterday 
 Well He's the most important thing to come 
 Well He's the most important thing today, yeah 
 Yeah 
 Just give your heart to Him (just give your heart to him) 
 And let Him do great things 
 So that we all can say (so that we all can say) 
 Jesus, we love you 
 Jesus, we love you 
 Jesus, we love you 
 Jesus, we love you (ooh) 
 Well He's the most important thing yesterday 
 Well He's the most important thing to come 
 Well He's the most important thing today, yeah 
 He's the most important thing today, yeah 
 He's the most important thing today

I'm not about to give up 
 Because I heard You say 
 There's gonna be brighter days 
 There's gonna be brighter days 
 I wont stop I'll keep my head up. 
 No I'm not here to stay 
 There's gonna be brighter days. 
 There's gonna be brighter days. 
 I just might bend but I won't break 
 As long as I can see Your face. 
 When life won't play along. 
 And right keeps going wrong. 
 And I cant seem to find my way. 
 I know where I am found. 
 So I won't let it drag me down. 
 Oh I'll keep dancing anyway. 
 I'm gonna move (move). 
 I'm gonna move (move). 
 I'm gonna move (I'm gonna move). 
 I've got to hold it steady 
 Keep my head in the game. 
 Everything is about to change. 
 Everything is about to change. 
 This hurt is getting heavy, 
 But I'm not about to cave. 
 Everything is about to change. 
 There's gonna be brighter days. 
 I just might bend but I won't break 
 As long as I can see Your face. 
 When life won't play along. 
 And right keeps going wrong. 
 And I can't seem to find my way. 
 I know where I am found, 
 So I won't let it drag me down. 
 Oh I'll keep dancing anyway. 
 No matter what may come. 
 Gonna move to a different drum. 
 No matter what life brings, 
 Gotta move, gotta move to a different beat 
 No matter what may come 
 Gotta move to a different drum 
 No matter what life brings 
 Gotta move gotta move to a different beat 
 I just might bend but wont break 
 As long as I can see your face 
 When life wont play along. 
 And right keeps going wrong. 
 And I cant seem to find my way. 
 I know where I am found, 
 So I won't let it drag me down. 
 Oh I'll keep dancing anyway 
 When life wont play along. 
 And right keeps going wrong. 
 And I cant seem to find my way. 
 I know where I am found, 
 So I won't let it drag me down. 
 Oh I'll keep dancing anyway 
 I'm gonna move (move)                                   No matter what may come

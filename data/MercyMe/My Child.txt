Matters of the heart 
 Searching for a home 
 Longing for someone 
 To whom you can run 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Open for a love 
 A lap to climb onto 
 Dreaming of a day 
 When you hear a voice say... 
 My child, well done 
 Such a long way you have come 
 You need to look no more 
 Rest your weary head 
 You've found what you're looking for 
 My arms are open wide 
 For you to come inside 
 My child, well done 
 My body grows so tired 
 I feel I can't go on 
 When will this end? 
 Or should I say begin? 
 I focus my eyes on You 
 But my vision becomes blurred 
 Now magnifies my fears 
 Lord, when will I hear? 
 My child, well done 
 Such a long way you have come 
 You need to look no more 
 Rest your weary head 
 You've found what you're looking for 
 My arms are open wide 
 For you to come inside 
 My child, well done 
 When I am in your heart 
 You are in my hands 
 We'll never be torn apart 
 Even when the world demands 
 My child, well done 
 My child, well done 
 Such a long way you have come 
 You need to look no more 
 Rest your weary head 
 You've found what you're looking for 
 My arms are open wide 
 For you to come inside, yea-eah 
 My child, well done 
 Such a long way you have come 
 You need to look no more 
 Rest your weary head 
 You've found what you're looking for 
 My arms are open wide 
 For you to come inside 
 My child, well, well done, yea-eah

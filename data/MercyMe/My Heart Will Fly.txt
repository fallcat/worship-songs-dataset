Why this happened I cannot explain why write the script with such heartache and pain could 
 There not have been an easier way watching life through this glass so faded I cannot see the 
 Bigger picture taking place oh to understand one day. 
 When I finally see you face to face and my tears will fly away, away. 
 It won't be long until we all go home with all things revealed and on that day we'll finally 
 Know oh, as we are fully known. [back to chorus] 
 And what appears as incomplete is still completely Yours and one day we'll see as we've been 
 Seen and we'll soar. [back to chorus]

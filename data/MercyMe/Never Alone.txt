It's been one of those days 
 When everything just feels so far away 
 Hope don't be a stranger 
 Won't you help me make it through today? 
 Then a voice comes calling out to me 
 You're never alone 'cause I am with you 
 And I will always be 
 I will hold you cause you belong to me 
 You're never alone 'cause I'll be with you 
 For all eternity 
 Someone tell me how I 
 Stumble into doubting all the time 
 Some days I'm all together 
 And other days I stand here asking why 
 Then a voice comes calling out to me 
 You're never alone 'cause I am with you 
 And I will always be 
 I will hold you cause you belong to me 
 You're never alone 'cause I'll be with you 
 For all eternity 
 Then a voice comes calling out to me 
 You're never alone 'cause I am with you 
 And I will always be 
 I will hold you cause you belong to me 
 You're never alone 'cause I'll be with you 
 For all eternity 
 (Repeat) 
 You're never alone 
 You're never alone

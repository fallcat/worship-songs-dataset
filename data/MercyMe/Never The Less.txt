So tell me, what's a man like You 
 Doing in a place like this? 
 How can You see any kind of hope 
 Through all of this mess? 
 We've tuned You out in every way 
 And found the truth is whatever that we say 
 Your sovereign plan we've dismissed 
 And sealed it all with a kiss 
 So let me ask You again 
 What's a man like You 
 Doing in a place like this? 
 Nevertheless, You've hear our cries 
 You've sacrificed 
 Your name has been glorified 
 Our sins confessed, our faith addressed 
 You've saved us nevertheless 
 Oh, the mess we've made 
 And oh, the price You've paid 
 Why do You love us? Why show Your face? 
 When we're unfaithful You still have faith 
 What is it that You see in us? 
 That keeps You from saying 'that's enough' 
 Oh, Your amazing grace 
 Nevertheless, You've hear our cries 
 You've sacrificed 
 Your name has been glorified 
 Our sins confessed, our faith addressed 
 You've saved us nevertheless 
 If my people called by my name 
 If they will humble themselves and pray 
 And seek my face and turn from their sins 
 Oh, I will hear and forgive them 
 Nevertheless 
 And how precious is the throne 
 That makes me white as snow 
 Ooohh, that I know 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood 
 Nothing but

Oh Lord have mercy on this weary soul 
 Come and take me to the river and make me whole 
 It's down with the old up with the new 
 The hard reset my life take two 
 Oh Lord have mercy on this weary soul 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 They say you only live once 
 But I live twice 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 Yeah... 
 Oh Lord remind me of who I am 
 My chains have been shattered I'm a brand new man 
 I'm free indeed, I'm dead no more 
 At my worst I'm still adored 
 Oh Lord remind me, this is who I am 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 They say you only live once 
 But I live twice 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 Yeah... 
 The enemy knows where I call my home, but he's still trying 
 To mess up my life in the meantime, so Lord remind me 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 They say you only live once 
 But I live twice 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 I've got a new lease on life 
 Yeah...

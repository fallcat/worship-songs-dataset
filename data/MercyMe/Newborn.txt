Hallelujah the newborn has come 
 (x6) 
 Come and be born new 
 Our King has come, come to us 
 (x4) 
 Away in a manger 
 No crib for a bed 
 The little Lord Jesus 
 Laid down His sweet head 
 The stars in the sky 
 Looked down where He lay 
 The little Lord Jesus 
 Asleep on the hay 
 Hark the herald angels sing 
 "Glory to the newborn king 
 Peace on earth and mercy mild 
 God and sinners reconciled" 
 With angelic host proclaim 
 "Christ is born in Bethlehem" 
 Hark the herald angels sing 
 "Glory to the newborn king" 
 (Unto us a son is given) 
 (Unto us a child is born) 
 (x4) 
 Mild He lays His glory by 
 Born that man no more may die 
 Born to raise the sons of earth 
 Born to give them second birth 
 Hark the herald angels sing 
 "Glory to the newborn king"

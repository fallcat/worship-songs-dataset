I'm not trying to hide anything 
 I wear it on my sleeve 
 I wear it on my sleeve 
 I'm not trying to be something I'm not 
 This is all I've got 
 This is all I've got 
 I'm not trying re-invent the wheel 
 Just trying to be real 
 Trying to be real 
 I'm not trying to say follow me 
 I'm not the one who leads 
 I'm not the one who leads 
 Let me introduce myself to you 
 This is who I am 
 No more no less 
 I am just a man who understands 
 Because of You I'm blessed 
 No More no less 
 I'm not trying to prove anything 
 It's all about the change 
 All about the change 
 I hope you stare just long enough to see 
 The heart that's beating here inside of me 
 Beyond all of the things you may think you know 
 I'm just a kid Trying to make it home that's it 
 No more no less 
 Lord I want to go home 
 Nothing more nothing less

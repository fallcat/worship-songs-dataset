I'm so busy being busy 
 That there's just no time 
 To sit and listen awhile 
 For a rest, just for awhile 
 And I see it, oh I see it 
 But I'm not so sure 
 That I'm looking through Your eyes 
 Or through mine, let me rest awhile 
 I'm always trying to see 
 Something I'd rather see 
 Why can't I only see what You do 
 Cut the mask away 
 And step from the shade 
 Let the Son of God come 
 Shine upon my face 
 Trust the cross of Lord 
 That His love has been shown 
 And apart from You, Lord 
 There's nothing I can do 
 No, there's nothing I can do 
 Oh, we sing and we play 
 But we never think to 
 Take our masks away 
 We have needs, we all have pain 
 On the inside, deep on the inside 
 In the places where 
 Not too many get to see 
 Jesus waits to make you and me 
 We're all just trying to be 
 Someone we'd rather be 
 Why can't we all just be in You 
 Cut the mask away 
 And step from the shade 
 Let the Son of God come 
 Shine upon my face 
 Trust the cross of Lord 
 That His love has been shown 
 And apart from You, Lord 
 There's nothing I can do 
 No, there's nothing I can do 
 Nothing I can do 
 Nothing I can do 
 We're all just trying to be 
 Someone we'd rather be 
 Why can't we all just be in You

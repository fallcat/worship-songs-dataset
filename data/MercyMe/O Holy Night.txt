O holy night the stars are brightly shining 
 It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
 Til He appeared and the soul felt His worth 
 A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn 
 Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices 
 O night divine O night when Christ was born 
 O night divine O night O night divine 
 Divine 
 Divine 
 Fall on your knees Oh hear the angel voices 
 O night divine O night when Christ was born 
 O night divine O night O night divine

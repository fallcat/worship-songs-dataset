Old man walking down the street 
 Suitcase in one hand 
 Burdens in the other 
 Searching the land 
 He just wants to find Jesus 
 He just wants to be free 
 He looks in all of 
 Stuff of this world 
 Trying to find someone 
 Who's not of this world 
 He just wants to find Jesus 
 He just wants to be free 
 'To anyone who will listen 
 My tears won't let me see 
 I need to find this Savior 
 Tell me, where could he be?' 
 'I just want to find Jesus 
 I just want to be free 
 I need to be free' 
 I told him how to find Him 
 Told him what he had to do 
 I said, 'You don't have to go searching 
 Thanks to grace, He'll come to you' 
 The old man found Jesus 
 And Jesus set him free 
 New man walking down the street 
 Suitcase in one hand 
 The Bible in the other 
 Searching the land 
 He just wants to find people 
 Who just want to be free, yeah 
 He just wants to show them Jesus 
 'Cause that's what they need 
 It's what they need 
 Mmm, Jesus

Almost there 
 Almost where I'm supposed to be 
 It's not all clear 
 But You keep showing me 
 With every step 
 The more my heart moves to Your beat 
 Just like where I'm headed 
 There's joy in the journey 
 Teach me to think like You think 
 Show me the things that are true 
 Finish the work You have started in me 
 As I'm on my way to You 
 As I'm on my way to You 
 Create in me 
 A pure heart and make me new 
 Less of me, Jesus, more of You 
 Here I stand 
 Still I'm drawn down to my knees 
 It's not my strength 
 But Yours that carries me 
 Teach me to think like You think 
 Show me the things that are true 
 Finish the work You have started in me 
 As I'm on my way to You 
 As I'm on my way to You 
 Yes, I'm on my way to You 
 Teach me to think like You think 
 Show me the things that are true 
 Finish the work You have started in me 
 As I'm on my way to You 
 As I'm on my way to You 
 Yes, I'm on my way to You 
 I'm on my way (yea-ea-eah) 
 I'm on my way (yea-ea-eah) 
 I'm on my way (yea-ea-eah) 
 I'm on my way to You

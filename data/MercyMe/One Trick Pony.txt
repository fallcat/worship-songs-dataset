I'm a one trick pony if you will 
 I got a one track mind with a heart that's real 
 And don't forget I've got tunnel vision 
 For something much bigger than superstition 
 Call me hard headed for the one that changed me 
 Say what you will it will not phase me 
 No need for anything up my sleeve 
 There's just one thing that I'll ever need 
 You are my one and only (repeat) 
 Oh I'm a one trick pony 
 If I hear just one more time 
 That I should try and be more open-minded 
 I think I just might scream 
 The world says this is all there is 
 Yet I believe the One who says there's life after this 
 Now tell me how much more open can my mind be

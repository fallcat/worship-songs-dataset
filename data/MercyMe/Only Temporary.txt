Don't let the situation get to you 
 This is not a hill worth dying on 
 Do't let these circumstances tear your heart in two 
 Soon enough this chapter will be gone 
 What's insurmountable today 
 Will surely one day fade away 
 There's a reason why this world just don't feel right 
 'Cause we are strangers who are simply passing by 
 In light of all eternity 
 It's only temporary 
 This place was never meant to be my home 
 Not comfortable in my own skin 
 Which may explain some of those days I feel alone 
 Standing on the outside looking in 
 But you're not hearing me complain 
 'Cause I'm already on my way 
 This place was never meant to be my home 
 Not comfortable in my own skin

Hush little baby don't you cry 
 Heaven's watching out for you tonight 
 Watching you tonight 
 Hush little baby don't you fret 
 Nothing's gonna hurt you 
 Not even death 
 No not even death 
 Lullaby 
 Let heaven and angels sing for you tonight 
 For you tonight 
 This is our lullaby 
 Peace on earth has finally arrived 
 Hush now Mary don't be afraid 
 Baby done come to clear the way 
 Come to clear the way 
 Hush now Joseph, don't you fuss 
 Soon this child gonna carry us 
 Gonna carry us 
 Lullaby 
 Let heaven and angels sing for you tonight 
 For you tonight 
 This is our lullaby 
 Peace on earth has finally arrived 
 The day will come soon enough 
 When you are singing over us 
 But tonight sleep in heavenly peace 
 And we'll be the ones to sing 
 Lullaby 
 Let heaven and angels sing for you tonight 
 For you tonight 
 This is our lullaby 
 Peace on earth has finally arrived 
 Hush little baby don't you cry 
 Heaven's watching out for you tonight 
 Watching you tonight

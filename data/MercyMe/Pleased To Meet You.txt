Before I met You 
 I was really running for my life 
 But now I know You 
 And I want to say that I... 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 I'm so glad that You met me 
 I'm so glad just to know You 
 I'm so glad that You know me 
 Yeah, well I'm, now! 
 When I think there's nothing 
 In my life or in my heart 
 You reveal a plan for me 
 You've had from the very start 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 I'm so glad that You met me 
 I'm so glad just to know You 
 I'm so glad that You know me 
 Yeah! 
 There have been times that I've fallen 
 And cried, 'God, oh, help me please' 
 Instead of picking me up 
 You get me down before my knees 
 And I cried, 'Lord, hold me 
 Lord, hold me, take control of me 
 So that I can see Jesus' 
 We'll see Jesus, and I said... 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 I'm so glad that You met me 
 I'm so glad just to know You 
 I'm so glad that You know me 
 I'm so glad, we're so glad 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 1, 2, 3, 4! 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 I'm so glad that I met You 
 I'm so glad that I met You

May the glory of the Lord endure forever 
 May the Lord rejoice in His works 
 He who looks at the earth and it trembles 
 He who touches the mountains and they burn 
 I will sing to the Lord all of my life 
 I will sing to my God as long as I live 
 May my meditations please You 
 As I rejoice in You, Lord 
 Praise You, Lord, forevermore 
 May the glory of the Lord endure forever

 Make my meditations please You 
 As I rejoice in You, Lord 
 Praise You, Lord, forevermore

 Praise You, Lord, forevermore 
 Praise You, Lord, forevermore, yea-eah

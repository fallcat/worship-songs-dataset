And I scrub and scrub 
 But my hands won't come clean 
 Of this sin that's underneath my nails 
 I've given everything a chance at molding me 
 But everything continues to fail 
 Who holds the keys to my closet? 
 Who sees my wrong 
 But won't hold it against me? 
 Guilt, leave me alone 
 It's been forgiven and forgotten so let me be 
 My memory won't leave me alone 
 Of my past, it keeps reminding me 
 Can my heart be recovered? 
 Someone give me the chance to start over 
 And over and over and over 
 What this clay needs is a new potter 
 Who's every touch shapes me free 
 What these hands need is breathing water 
 To restore purity, yeah! 
 Faith, where are you off to? 
 Don't be gone too long 
 It's going to be dark soon 
 And you won't find your way home 
 And all the world's horses 
 And all the world's men 
 Could not put my heart back together again 
 What this clay needs is a new potter 
 Who's every touch shapes me free 
 What these hands need is breathing water 
 To restore purity, yeah, yeah-yeah 
 And I can't imagine where I'd be 
 And I can't imagine where I'd be 
 What this clay needs is a new potter 
 Who's every touch shapes me free 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 What these hands need is breathing water 
 To restore purity, yeah! 
 Oh, purity, yeah-yeah! Ooh! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-eah! 
 Yeah, yeah

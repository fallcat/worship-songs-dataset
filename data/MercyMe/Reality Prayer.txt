There's a veil across the land, not a wide veil 
 One as black as the sin by which it was created 
 And It covers every corner of the world 
 Can it be lifted? Lord, I sure hope so 
 Men trying to be of God are on their knees 
 And they are asking for the Father's hand 
 With doubt in their voice as they've yet to see 
 Their own type of delivery 
 And they talk to their Father in so many formalities 
 They were taught that way I guess, it seems 
 I just wish the child left in us would find its way out 
 Crying, 'Please, please, oh daddy, please' 
 If faith so small can move mountains 
 Can we not believe enough to be set free? 
 Whoa, we need to be free 
 Oh, we need to be free 
 You know He tore the veil once 
 He can tear it again 
 And He can bring us in 
 From the reign of sin 
 And He can do everything 
 That we have ever hoped for 
 And He can do things 
 That we never could comprehend 
 Oh, He is our God, He is almighty 
 As the Holy One 
 He is our God, He is almighty 
 As the Holy One 
 Oh, He is our hope, He's our salvation 
 The one thing to cling to 
 You are our God, You are almighty 
 You're the Holy One 
 You are our God, You are almighty 
 You're the Holy One 
 Jesus, You are our God, You are almighty 
 You're the Holy One

Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
 At the Christmas party hop 
 Mistletoe hung where you can see 
 Ev'ry couple tries to stop 
 Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
 Let the Christmas spirit ring 
 Later we'll have some pumpkin pie 
 And we'll do some caroling 
 You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear 
 Voices singing "Let's be jolly 
 Deck the halls with boughs of holly" 
 Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
 Have a happy holiday 
 Ev'ryone dancing merrily 
 In the new old fashioned way 
 Come on Mary, take it home now, come 
 - spoken 
 You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear 
 Voices singing "Let's be jolly 
 Deck the halls with boughs of holly" 
 Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
 Have a happy holiday 
 Ev'ryone dancing merrily 
 In the new old fashioned way

No more boarding up my windows 
 So that I can lay low 
 Nobody's home 
 No more trying to run away from 
 Tired of being afraid of 
 What I can't control 
 The hardest part I'm always told 
 Is letting go 
 Safe and sound knowing that you're big enough to 
 Rap around my heart completely 
 Safe and sound just knowing that you know me 
 I can finally set my heart free 
 Lost within the mystery 
 Of this love I've found 
 There is nothing that can pull me 
 From the hand that holds me 
 I'm safe and sound 
 The hardest part I'm always told 
 Is letting go 
 The greatest part now I know 
 Is letting go

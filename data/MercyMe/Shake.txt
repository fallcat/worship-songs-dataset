I just can't believe 
 Where my life was at 
 All that I know is that my heart was broken 
 And I don't ever wanna go back 
 Ain't no explanation 
 How I saw the light 
 He found me and set me free 
 And it brought me back to life 
 Blame it on the transformation 
 Changed down to the core 
 His love is real 
 And I can't sit still 
 Cause my name's not shamed no more 
 Great God Almighty, gonna change this 
 Great God Almighty, He gonna change me 
 You gotta shake, shake, shake 
 Like you're changed, changed, changed 
 Brand new looks so good on you 
 So shake like you've been changed 
 Come on and shake, shake, shake like you changed 
 Shake, shake, shake like you changed 
 Maybe He came to you 
 When everything seemed fine 
 Or maybe your world was upside down and hit you right between the eyes 
 No matter when it happened 
 At 7 or 95 
 Move your feet 'cause you are free 
 And you've never been more alive 
 You gotta shake, shake, shake 
 Like you're changed, changed, changed 
 Brand new looks so good on you 
 So shake like you've been changed 
 Come on and shake, shake, shake 
 Like you're changed, changed, changed 
 Brand new looks so good on you 
 So shake like you've been changed 
 Come on and shake, shake, shake like you changed 
 Shake, shake, shake like you changed 
 Shake, shake 
 Great God Almighty, gonna change me 
 Great God Almighty, He gonna change me 
 Great God Almighty, gonna change me 
 Great God Almighty, He gonna change me 
 No matter when it happened 
 At 7 or 95 
 Move your feet, 'cause you are free 
 And you've never been more alive 
 You gotta shake, shake, shake 
 Like you're changed, changed, changed 
 Brand new looks so good on you 
 So shake like you've been changed 
 You gotta shake, shake, shake 
 Like you're changed, changed, changed 
 Brand new looks so good on you 
 So shake like you've been changed 
 Come on and shake, shake, shake 
 Like you're changed, changed, changed 
 Brand new looks so good on you

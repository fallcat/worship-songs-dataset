If we're to be the light 
 That shines for all of man 
 Then how can we light the way 
 If we don't go to them 
 I believe to know God's heart 
 Is to meet them where they are 
 Won't you shine on 
 Won't you shine on 
 You can shine on 
 Shine on 
 In all that's said and done 
 And everything you do 
 Just let your life glorify 
 The one who shines on you 
 I believe we worship Christ 
 When we show the world His light 
 Won't you shine on 
 Won't you shine on 
 You can shine on 
 Shine on 
 Shine on 
 Shine on 
 Won't you shine on 
 Won't you shine on 
 You can shine on 
 Shine on 
 Won't you shine on 
 Won't you shine on 
 You can shine on 
 Shine on

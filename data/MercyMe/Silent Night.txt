Silent night, holy night 
 All is calm, singing all is bright 
 Round yon virgin Mother and Child 
 Holy Infant so tender and mild 
 Sleep in heavenly peace 
 Oh Sleep in heavenly peace 
 Silent night, holy night 
 Shepherds quake oh at the sight 
 Glories stream from heaven afar 
 Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia 
 Christ the Savior is born! 
 Christ the Savior is born! 
 Oh... 
 Silent night, (such a silent night) holy night (O what a holy, holy night) 
 Son of God (Son of God), oh love's pure light (what a lovely light) 
 Oh now radiant beams from Thy holy face 
 Oh with, with the dawn, the dawn of redeeming grace 
 Oh Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth 
 Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth 
 Oh... 
 Anything...ha ha ha ha

My heart's beating out of my chest 
 I've lost the words to say 
 Trying to stay calm at best 
 'Cause you've looked my way 
 Give me peace Lord Jesus 
 I need to sleep tonight 
 Like a newborn waiting 
 To hear a lullaby 
 I am here anticipating 
 Your voice tonight 
 Oh won't you sing 
 Sing over me 
 Lord won't you sing 
 Sing over me 
 Let Your grace fall upon me 
 Like the sweetest of symphonies 
 Oh please sing over me

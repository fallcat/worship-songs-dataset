Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling 
 Ring ting ting-a-ting too 
 C'mon it's lovely weather 
 For a sleigh ride together with you 
 Outside the snow is falling 
 And friends are calling you hoo 
 C'mon it's lovely weather 
 For a sleigh ride together with you 
 Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go 
 Let's look at the show 
 Riding in a wonderland of snow 
 Giddy-up giddy-up it's grand 
 Just holding your hand 
 We're gliding along with a song 
 Of a wintery fairyland 
 Our cheeks are nice and rosy 
 And comfy cozy are we 
 We're snuggled up together 
 Like two birds of a feather would be 
 Let's take that road before us 
 And sing a chorus or two 
 C'mon it's lovely weather 
 For a sleigh ride together with you 
 Giddy-up giddy-up giddy-up let's go 
 Let's look at the show 
 Riding in a wonderland of snow 
 Giddy-up giddy-up it's grand 
 Just holding your hand 
 We're gliding along with a song 
 Of a wintery fairyland 
 Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling 
 Ring ting ting-a-ting too 
 C'mon it's lovely weather 
 For a sleigh ride together with you 
 Outside the snow is falling 
 And friends are calling you hoo 
 C'mon it's lovely weather 
 For a sleigh ride together with you 
 Sleigh ride together with you 
 Sleigh ride together with you

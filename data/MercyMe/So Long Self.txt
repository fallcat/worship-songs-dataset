Well if I come across a little bit distant 
 It's just because I am 
 Things just seem to feel a little bit different 
 You understand 
 Believe it or not but life is not apparently 
 About me anyways 
 But I have met the One who really is worthy 
 So let me say 
 So long self 
 Well it's been fun, but I have found somebody else 
 So long self 
 There's just no room for two 
 So you are gonna have to move 
 So long self 
 Don't take this wrong but you are wrong for me farewell 
 Oh well, Goodbye, don't cry 
 So Long Self 
 Stop right there because I know what your thinking 
 But no we can't be friends 
 And even though I know your heart is breaking 
 This has to end 
 And come to think of it the blame for all of this 
 Simply falls on me 
 For wanting something more in life than all of this 
 Can't you see 
 Don't feel so bad (don't feel so bad) 
 There'll be better days (there'll be better days) 
 Don't go away mad (but by all means) 
 Just go away, go away

Where... where do I begin 
 How do I say what's on my heart with paper and a pen? 
 How... how can I describe 
 ...The God of all the universe and make it rhyme? 
 I just wonder if it's worth 
 Painting You with so few words 
 Oh with so few words 
 Still there's something about You 
 That keeps me in pursuit of who You are 
 I will spend my days, finding ways to praise 
 The glory and the grace of who you are 
 Why... why do I even try 
 If I could speak the tongue of every man I'm still tongue-tied 
 What can I say about You 
 When everything I have won't do 
 Oh It will not do 
 As long as life runs through my veins 
 I will live to praise Your name 
 And if a hundred years I live 
 I won't even scratch, I won't even scratch the surface

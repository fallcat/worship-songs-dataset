There's a stirring deep within me 
 Could it be my time has come? 
 When I'll see my gracious Savior 
 Face to face when all is done 
 Is that His voice I am hearing? 
 ‘Come away, my precious one’ 
 Is he calling me? 
 Is he calling me? 
 I will rise up, rise up 
 And bow down 
 And lay my crown 
 At his wounded feet 
 There's a stirring deep within me 
 Could it be my time has come? 
 When I'll see my gracious Savior 
 Face to face when all is done 
 Is that His voice I am hearing? 
 ‘Come away, my precious one’ 
 Is he calling me? 
 Is he calling me? 
 I will rise up, rise up 
 And bow down 
 And lay my crown 
 At his wounded feet 
 Is that His voice I am hearing? 
 ‘Come away my precious one’ 
 I will rise up, rise up 
 And bow down 
 And lay my crown 
 At his wounded feet 
 I will rise up, rise up 
 And bow down 
 And lay my crown 
 At his wounded feet 
 I will rise up, rise up 
 And bow down 
 And lay my crown 
 At his wounded feet

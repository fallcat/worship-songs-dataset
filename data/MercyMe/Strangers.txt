You may never be given fame 
 No one may recognize your name 
 You may not ever see your day 
 But as a child of God it's okay 
 Because I know, oh, yes, I know 
 This place is not to be my home 
 And now I see this world and me 
 Were never meant to be 
 Out of this world into Your hands 
 We're strangers passing through this land 
 Out of this world into Your presence, Lord 
 Father, we're forever Yours 
 Make all I can is what I'm told 
 To make this place a better home 
 What profits? Man, I don't know 
 To gain the world but lose his soul 
 But now I know, oh, yes, I know 
 This place is not to be my home 
 And now I see this world and me 
 Were never meant to be 
 Out of this world into Your hands 
 We're strangers passing through this land 
 Out of this world into Your presence, Lord 
 Father, we're forever Yours 
 We're forever Yours 
 Out of this world into Your hands 
 We're strangers passing through this land 
 Out of this world into Your presence, Lord 
 Father, we're forever Yours 
 We're forever Yours 
 (Out of this world into Your hands) 
 We're forever Yours 
 (Out of this world into Your hands) 
 We're forever Yours 
 (Out of this world into Your hands) 
 We're forever Yours 
 (Out of this world into Your hands) 
 We're Yours, we're Yours, we're Yours

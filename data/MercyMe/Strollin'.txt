Strolling with Jesus 
 Down the narrow street 
 Strolling with Jesus 
 Just moving my feet, now 
 Strolling with Jesus, Jesus 
 Now my life is complete 
 Sitting in the room 
 With my chin to the ground 
 Things looking tough 
 There ain't no one around 
 How I need my situation found 
 Then this man picked me up 
 And as He pushed on my sack 
 He said, 'look here boy 
 It's time to get back on track' 
 Strolling with Jesus 
 Down the narrow street 
 Strolling with Jesus 
 Just moving my feet 
 Strolling with Jesus, Jesus 
 Now my life is complete 
 No need to worry, thing 
 You're mighty fine 
 Jesus stepped in 
 He saved me just in time 
 Ain't no need for me to step out of line 
 Well now, travelling with Jesus 
 I feel well equipped, now 
 One thing's for sure 
 This is a big road trip 
 Strolling with Jesus 
 Down the narrow street 
 Strolling with Jesus 
 Just moving my feet, now 
 Strolling with Jesus, Jesus 
 Now my life is complete 
 Well if your ways are looking like a dead end 
 Take a ride on Jesus' street, oh, what a friend 
 If you're stuck and help is what you need 
 Call upon His name and He will tell you for free, now 
 Oh, yeah 
 Oh, oh, yeah! 
 Strolling with Jesus 
 Down the narrow street, yeah 
 Strolling with Jesus 
 Just moving my feet 
 Just moving my feet 
 Strolling with Jesus, Jesus 
 Now my life is complete 
 Strolling with Jesus, Jesus 
 Now my life is complete

Day after day at a table by myself 
 I wave 'hello' to the world as it passes by 
 Scratching my chin for the meaning of meaning 
 Who? What? Where? When and why? 
 But then You introduce Yourself to me 
 Your offer I could not believe 
 And then I looked into Your eyes 
 And suddenly realized 
 That my days of sitting alone are through 
 From now on I'll have a table for two 
 Spending my life trying to find my place 
 Come to find out, I've got no reservations 
 Slipping my way through an open back door 
 Come to find out that all the seats are taken 
 Then You introduce Yourself to me 
 Your offer I could not believe 
 And then I looked into Your eyes 
 And suddenly realized 
 That my days of sitting alone are through 
 From now on I'll have a table for two 
 Then You introduce Yourself to me 
 Your offer I could not believe 
 And then I looked into Your eyes 
 And suddenly realized 
 That my days of sitting alone are through 
 From now on I'll have a table for two 
 A table for two, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Ba-dee-beep-ba-boo! 
 Boo-boo-doo-maa-ba-dee-ba-boo! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

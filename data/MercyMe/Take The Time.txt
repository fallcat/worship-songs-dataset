You can turn around and walk away 
 Tell yourself there's nothing here to see 
 Try so hard to look the other way 
 As if you haven't noticed anything 
 Do it to the least of these 
 Do it to Me 
 You gotta take the time 
 You gotta take the time 
 Shallow is the voice of no concern 
 Running through the bridges that we've burned 
 You can't even feel your own demise 
 So how can you pretend to lead the blind 
 Do it to the least of these 
 Do it to Me 
 You gotta take the time 
 You gotta take the time 
 I'm the hungry and the weak 
 Can you even see me 
 I'm the stranger all alone 
 Won't you welcome me home 
 I'm the naked and ashamed 
 Won't you look my way 
 You gotta take the time 
 You gotta take the time 
 You gotta take, take, take 
 Take the time 
 You gotta take, take, take 
 Take the time 
 You gotta take, take, take 
 Take the time 
 You gotta take, take, take 
 Take the time 
 You gotta take, take, take 
 Take the time 
 You gotta take, take, take 
 Take the time 
 You gotta take, take, take 
 Take the time 
 Take the time

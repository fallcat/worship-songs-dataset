Here's a little tune 
 You'll be happy to know 
 Keep it close to you 
 Wherever you may go 
 God gave us ten simple rules 
 To get us through 
 A little something 
 Just for us to live by 
 So now hide them in your heart 
 And you will be fine 
 And Lord said 
 Have no other gods but God 
 To worship idols just won't do 
 Be careful with the way you use God's name 
 And keep Sunday special too. 
 Honor your parents, don't take any lives. 
 And when you're old enough to marry, be true. 
 Do not steal or lie 
 Or want those things that don't belong to you 
 These are ten simple rules God gave to me and you 
 Now the good Lord said 
 You better listen to me 
 If you follow these rules 
 Then they will set you free 
 Because I want you to live 
 A happy life 
 And help others 
 To be happy too 
 So when things go wrong 
 These words 
 Will get you through

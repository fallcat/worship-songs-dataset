Ten years old, you're walking down the aisle 
 You let God in and it's totally in style 
 Where years have come and gone 
 And so did your courage 
 You put God in a box 
 And you threw Him in storage 
 When you can't find what you're looking for 
 And your heart's been screaming for more and more 
 When you search so long you can't even stand 
 And the way back home is the Father's hand 
 Your heart says less, your head says more 
 And in between is where you're torn 
 Trace your steps to where you were before, yeah 
 The right idea was Yours from page one 
 But through time Your vision has gone 
 Well God took the back seat 
 While your flesh started driving, yes He did 
 The world feels fine while the Spirit Man is dying 
 When you can't find what you're looking for 
 And your heart's been screaming for more and more 
 When you search so long you can't even stand 
 And the way back home is the Father's hand 
 Your heart says less, your head says more 
 And in between is where you're torn 
 Trace your steps to where you were before, oh, oh 
 Lord, please take over 
 Won't you deliver us? 
 How we long to get back 
 To the way that it was 
 To the way that it was 
 To the way that it was 
 Now, now! 
 When you can't find what you're looking for 
 And your heart's been screaming for more and more 
 When you search so long you can't even stand 
 And the way back home is the Father's hand 
 Your heart says less, your head says more 
 And in between is where you're torn 
 Trace your steps to where you were before 
 Oh, oh yeah, trace your steps now

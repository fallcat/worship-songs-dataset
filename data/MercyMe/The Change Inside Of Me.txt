Pardon me 
 If I've been acting strange 
 I haven't been myself lately 
 What you see 
 Is a person rearranged 
 Someone affected me greatly 
 And I've got so much to say 
 Ever since Jesus looked my way 
 Gonna raise my voice like thunder 
 And leave the world in wonder of the change 
 The change inside of me 
 And I will never stop believing 
 That You are the reason for this change 
 The change inside of me 
 Everyday 
 I'm taking in the view 
 Of His glory around me 
 I'm awake 
 And I have been made new 
 By the One who has found me 
 Words just can't say enough 
 When all I can feel is love 
 Gonna raise my voice like thunder 
 And leave the world in wonder of the change 
 The change inside of me 
 And I will never stop believing 
 That You are the reason for this change 
 The change inside of me 
 Your life You gave for mine to save 
 It's nothing less than a miracle 
 Your name I praise, because the change 
 Inside of me is so beautiful 
 Gonna raise my voice like thunder 
 And leave the world in wonder of the change 
 The change inside of me 
 And I will never stop believing 
 That You are the reason for this change 
 The change inside of me 
 Gonna raise my voice like thunder 
 And leave the world in wonder of the change 
 The change inside of me 
 And I will never stop believing 
 That You are the reason for this change

Day after day 
 I try to explain You 
 Like I can contain You 
 In so many words 
 But You are the ocean 
 And I'm on the shoreline 
 Thinking I know You 
 Like You could be learned 
 It's so amazing 
 That You'd ever save me 
 I thought I knew Your face 
 I thought I'd tasted grace 
 But I have never felt anything close to this 
 Just when I'd seen it all 
 New mercy breaks the dawn 
 And with my eyes open wide 
 It feels like the first time, first time 
 It feels like the first time, first time 
 After all of my searching 
 And all of my reaching 
 I'm left with nothing 
 Nothing of worth 
 You treasure the broken 
 Over and over 
 Give me a hope 
 That can never be earned 
 It's still amazing 
 That You'd ever save me 
 I thought I knew Your face 
 I thought I'd tasted grace 
 But I have never felt anything close to this 
 Just when I'd seen it all 
 New mercy breaks the dawn 
 And with my eyes open wide 
 It feels like the first time, first time 
 It feels like the first time, first time 
 And Your beauty 
 No eye has seen 
 Your majesty overwhelming 
 Your love for me 
 Is healing oh God 
 I thought I knew Your face 
 I thought I'd tasted grace 
 But it was nothing like this 
 Just when I'd seen it all 
 New mercy breaks the dawn 
 And with my eyes open wide 
 It feels like the first time, first time 
 Just like the first time, first time 
 I can see for the first time, first time 
 Just like the first time

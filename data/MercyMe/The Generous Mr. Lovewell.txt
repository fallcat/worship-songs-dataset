He wakes up every day the same 
 Believing he's gonna make a change 
 Never wonders "if" but "when". 
 I guarantee he can find a way 
 To reach out and make somebody's day. 
 Cause someone took the time with him 
 He believes it's the little things 
 That make a great big change. 
 Hey, Mr. Lovewell.  Doing today 
 What you do every day. 
 No matter how small 
 Believing that it's all the same. 
 Come on Mr. Lovewell. Oh we could use 
 A few more just like you, 
 Who care enough to give this life away. 
 'Cause you've been changed. 
 The generous Mr. Lovewell loves today. 
 It may be a simple "how do you do". 
 The kind of thing that could pull them through. 
 A minute or two can mean so much. 
 Or maybe it's the one across the street. 
 He's asking if there's anything they need. 
 'Cause they will know us by our love. 
 It may not mean that much to him. 
 But it's the world to them.

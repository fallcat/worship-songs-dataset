Why? 
 The question that is never far away 
 The healing doesn't come from the explained 
 Jesus please don't let this go in vain 
 You're all I have 
 All that remains 
 So here I am 
 What's left of me 
 Where glory meets my suffering 
 I'm alive 
 Even though a part of me has died 
 You take my heart and breathe it back to life 
 I've fallen into Your arms open wide 
 When the hurt and the healer collide 
 Breathe 
 Sometimes I feel it's all that I can do 
 Pain so deep that I can hardly move 
 Just keep my eyes completely fixed on You 
 Lord take hold and pull me through 
 So here I am 
 What's left of me 
 Where glory meets my suffering 
 I'm alive 
 Even though a part of me has died 
 You take my heart and breathe it back to life 
 I've fallen into your arms open wide 
 When the hurt and the healer collide 
 It's the moment when humanity 
 Is overcome by majesty 
 When grace is ushered in for good 
 And all our scars are understood 
 When mercy takes its rightful place 
 And all these questions fade away 
 When out of the weakness we must bow 
 And hear You say "It's over now" 
 I'm alive 
 Even though a part of me has died 
 You take my heart and breathe it back to life 
 I've fallen into your arms open wide 
 When The hurt and the healer collide 
 Jesus come and break my fear 
 Awake my heart and take my tears 
 Find Your glory even here 
 When the hurt and the healer collide (x2) 
 Jesus come and break my fear 
 Awake my heart and take my tears 
 Find Your glory even here

The love of God is greater far 
 Than tongue or pen can ever tell 
 It goes beyond the highest star 
 And reaches to the lowest hell 
 The guilty pair, bowed down with care 
 God gave His Son to win 
 His erring child He reconciled 
 And pardoned from his sin 
 Could we with ink the ocean fill 
 And were the skies of parchment made 
 Were every stalk on earth a quill 
 And every man a scribe by trade 
 To write the love of God above 
 Would drain the ocean dry 
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole 
 Though stretched from sky to sky 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 O love of God, how rich and pure! 
 How measureless and strong! 
 It shall forevermore endure 
 the saints' and angels' song

The nails in Your hands, the nail in Your feet 
 They tell me how much You love me 
 The thorns in Your brow, they tell me how 
 You bore so much shame to love me 
 And when the heavens pass away 
 All Your scars will still remain 
 And forever they will say 
 How much You love me 
 Forever my love, forever my heart 
 Forever my life is Yours 
 It's Yours 
 The nails in Your hands, the nail in Your feet 
 They tell me how much You love me 
 The thorns in Your brow, they tell me how 
 You bore so much shame to love me 
 And when the heavens pass away 
 All Your scars will still remain 
 And forever they will say 
 How much You love me 
 Forever my love, forever my heart 
 Forever my life is Yours 
 It's Yours 
 And when the heavens pass away 
 All Your scars will still remain 
 And forever they will say 
 How much You love me 
 Forever my love, forever my heart 
 Forever my life is Yours 
 It's Yours, it's Yours, it's Yours 
 And when the heavens pass away 
 All Your scars will still remain 
 And forever they will say 
 How much You love me 
 Forever my love, forever my heart 
 Forever my life, it's Yours

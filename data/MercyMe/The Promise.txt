I love you 
 And I will never leave you 
 Nor forsake you, and I love you 
 And I will never leave you 
 'Cause you are my child 
 You are my child 
 When you're down 
 When your heart is broken 
 When no one seems to care 
 Please know that I love you 
 'Cause you are my child 
 You are my child 
 And I want to wrap my arms around you 
 And I want to wrap my arms around you 
 And say everything 
 Everything'll be alright 
 'Cause you are my child 
 You are my child 
 Let me wipe those tears from your eyes 
 And let me wipe those tears from your eyes 
 And come to me, come to me 
 And come to Jesus, come to Him 
 And come to Jesus, come to Him

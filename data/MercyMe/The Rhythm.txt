Even though the world doesn't know each other, we walk in the same direction 
 Like those lemmings that march off a cliff into the ocean for no apparent reason and no objection 
 You know that direction, I call it the direction of "me"? 
 My goals, my stuff, how do I get first place, and could somebody up there cut me a break so I can win the lottery 
 Then all of a sudden somebody shows up who's totally set apart from the rest. 
 Well he's heading in the other direction for one and there's a peace in His eyes and a rhythm to His step. 
 It's as if he has found the answer to life, and come to find out the answer's not me, myself or I. 
 I think I'm sticking with that guy. 
 My heart will beat as one 
 To the beat of a different drum 
 The rhythm of Your love 
 My heart is dancing now 
 In time with what I've found 
 The rhythm of Your love 
 As if I didn't say enough in the first verse, there's something else that's bugging me 
 How can I have just one heart that beats for so many things at the same time continually? 
 It just doesn't make since. I mean technically I've only got one heartbeat in there 
 But I dance with so many things, do so many jigs you'd think I was Fred Astaire 
 I'm no rocket scientist, but it seems that every time you give a piece of your heart away 
 It can not be healthy... nor can it be as strong as well let's say 
 When the whole heart is beating as one for one thing one rhythm in unison 
 Now that my friend is good advice for anyone

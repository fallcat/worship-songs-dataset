A thousand may fall at your side 
 Ten thousand at your right hand 
 You saved my soul oh Jesus 
 You have come to heal my land 
 The Shadow of the Almighty 
 Makes the darkness flee 
 In His wings I'll find my refuge 
 Because His blood has covered me 
 He has commanded His angels 
 To guide us in all of our ways 
 They lift us up in their hands 
 So that we may give Him praise 
 His love has made me humble 
 I will honor him along 
 With my life I'll satisfy Him 
 And bow before His throne 
 Because His blood has covered me 
 Because His blood has covered me 
 Jesus, Your blood has covered me

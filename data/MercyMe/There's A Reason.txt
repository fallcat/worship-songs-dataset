Now's the time 
 Let the redeemed celebrate 
 If you know what I know 
 You can't wipe the smile off your face 
 Oh people, stand up and praise 
 There's a reason to dance 
 There's a reason to sing 
 Of the sacred romance 
 With our Savior and King 
 We lift up our hands 
 We fall on our knees 
 To the Son of Man 
 The reason we are free 
 There's a reason 
 All glory to 
 The King of Kings, Lord of Lords 
 Oh the value of Your worth 
 No worldly treasures can afford 
 And we praise You forevermore 
 There's a reason to dance 
 There's a reason to sing 
 Of the sacred romance 
 With our Savior and King 
 We lift up our hands 
 We fall on our knees 
 To the Son of Man 
 The reason we are free 
 There's a reason to stand 
 There's a reason to shout, to shout Your name on high 
 So we take up our cross, there's a reason to die 
 Because Jesus is alive 
 There's a reason 
 There's a reason to dance 
 There's a reason to sing 
 Of the sacred romance 
 With our Savior and King 
 We lift up our hands 
 We fall on our knees 
 To the Son of Man 
 The reason we are free 
 There's a reason 
 You are the reason 
 The ransom we are free

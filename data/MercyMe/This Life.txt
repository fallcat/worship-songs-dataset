This is not my home. 
 This is not my space. 
 Simply not my style. 
 This is not my place. 
 Can't get comfortable. 
 Can't get settled in. 
 I simply don't belong. 
 Cant get used to this 
 But I'm here right now. 
 I can hear You say 
 Make the most of me 
 . 
 This won't go to waste. 
 If I'm out of my mind yeah. 
 It's all for the Christ. 
 If I'm making sense then get in line. 
 Every moment is a chance to let your light break through. 
 This life, this life was meant to shine. 
 This life, this life was meant to shine. 
 I don't have to stall. 
 I don't have to wait. 
 Don't have to bide my time. 
 Till I make my escape. 
 'Cause heaven's in my heart . 
 I won't settle for less. 
 I will lift Your name by the life I live. 
 Every moment is a chance to let your light break through. 
 This life, this life was meant to shine. 
 This life, this life was meant to shine. 
 It's in my heart. 
 It's in my soul. 
 I'll live every day just to make You known. 
 'Cause this life, this life was meant to, meant to shine. 
 Hold your heads up high. 
 This is our moment to rise. 
 We were meant to shine. 
 Not just survive. 
 Hold your heads up high. 
 This is our moment to rise. 
 We were meant to shine. 
 Not just survive. 
 Hold your heads up high. 
 This is our moment to rise. 
 We were meant to shine. 
 This life, this life was meant to shine. 
 This life, this life was meant to shine. 
 It's in my heart. 
 It's in my soul. 
 I'll live every day just to make You known. 
 'Cause this life, this life was meant to, meant to shine. 
 It's in my heart. 
 It's in my soul. 
 I'll live every day just to make You known. 
 This life, this life was meant to, meant to shine. 
 We were meant to shine

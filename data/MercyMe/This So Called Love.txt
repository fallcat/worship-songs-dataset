I can be there for you when it can't get much harder. 
 I can cover your head when life starts to rain. 
 I can hold on tight when it feels like you're falling. 
 I can bread-crumb the path when you've lost your way. 
 I can make you laugh when the whole world is crying. 
 I can build you up when you're broken in shame. 
 But if all that we do is absent of Jesus. 
 Then this "so called" love is completely in vain.

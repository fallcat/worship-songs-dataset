To whom it may concern when will we learn. 
 We are all the same. 
 Do you really think that you're the first. 
 To fall along the way 
 It may sound crazy but what if. 
 You don't try to run. 
 Rather than kick our wounded. 
 We could just lift you up 
 Oh oh oh 
 We're not throwing stones. 
 Hey hey hey 
 You are not your shame. 
 Oh oh oh 
 You can't go alone. 
 Hey hey hey 
 We won't go away 
 I can see it's written on your face. 
 It reads with every line. 
 Wishing you could somehow just erase. 
 Or even turn back time 
 Don't let yourself buy into the lie. 
 That you are too far gone. 
 So let us remind you that you're. 
 Not what you have done 
 Oh oh oh 
 We're not throwing stones. 
 Hey hey hey 
 You are not your shame. 
 Oh oh oh 
 You can't go alone. 
 Hey hey hey 
 We won't go away 
 We're not throwing stones. 
 Hey hey hey 
 You are not your shame. 
 Oh oh oh 
 You can't go alone. 
 Hey hey hey 
 We won't go away 
 We won't go away 
 We won't go away 
 Breathe deep and believe that wherever you go. 
 It don't matter how high, don't matter how low. 
 It comes down to being found and 
 Who you know, you know, yeah

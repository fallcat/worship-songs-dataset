Forgive me if I stare 
 But I am taken back 
 That You would let me here 
 Regardless of my past 
 Oh my hands are shaking now 
 But I catch my breathe somehow 
 Oh, I am free at last 
 Unaware of my fears 
 Unaware of my shame 
 Nothing else matters here 
 But glorifying Your name 
 Unaware of everything 
 Knowing You're aware of me 
 Tell me how I got here 
 I couldn't make it on my own 
 Just tell me I can stay 
 Cause it feels so much like home 
 And I lose all track of time 
 When I look into Your eyes 
 Your love is all I know 
 Unaware of my fears 
 Unaware of my shame 
 Nothing else matters here 
 But glorifying Your name 
 Unaware of everything 
 Knowing You're aware of me 
 I'm aware I'm in a place I couldn't be 
 If You weren't there to call my name and rescue me 
 Unaware of my fears 
 Unaware of my shame 
 Nothing else matters here 
 But glorifying Your name 
 I'm unaware of all my fears 
 And I'm unaware of all my shame 
 Nothing else matters here 
 But glorifying Your name 
 I'm unaware that I still breathe 
 Unaware of everything 
 Knowing You're aware of me

Excuse me, but I think 
 You're knocking at the wrong heart 
 You see, I'm not naked or homeless 
 Or in need of food 
 And since you're looking 
 For those torn apart 
 I'm not the man for you 
 Me, I've got it all together 
 Playing with a full deck 
 Sure, I can hold my own 
 When it needs to be held 
 But I'm not the emotional wreck 
 Whose heart is up for sale 
 My daddy taught me 
 When he felt like teaching 
 There's only three things I need in life 
 That's me, myself, and I 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You're looking for someone 
 Who likes to serenade their pain 
 But me, I don't even like to sing 
 No need giving up these reigns 
 I'm just getting the hang of this thing 
 Why are you picking on me? 
 Do I actually look like I'm in need? 
 Oh, the stories I could tell 
 If there was something 
 Really wrong with me 
 With me, yeah! 
 My daddy taught me 
 When he felt like teaching 
 There's only three things I need in life 
 That's me, myself, and I, yeah, yeah! 
 What are you looking at? 
 I don't have the problem 
 What are you staring at? 
 I'm not the one in need 
 I'm not the one in need, yeah! 
 My daddy taught me 
 When he felt like teaching 
 There's only three things I need in life 
 That's me, myself, and I 
 Me, myself, and I, and I 
 That's me, myself, and I, and I 
 Me, myself, and I 
 God, help us 
 God, save us 
 God, change us 
 God, break us, break us, break us

No apologies 
 For who I'm meant to be 
 The only thing that matters is 
 I am free 
 When I am overwhelmed 
 Holding pieces of my heart 
 When I feel my world 
 Start to fall apart 
 To the cross I run 
 Holding high my chains undone 
 Now I am finally free 
 Free to be what I've become 
 Undone 
 Even in defeat 
 The face of tragedy 
 Still you'd have to say that 
 I found victory 
 In brokenness comes beauty 
 Divine fragility 
 Reminding me of nail scarred hands 
 Reaching out for me 
 To the cross I run 
 Holding high my chains undone 
 Now I am finally free 
 Free to be what I've become 
 To the cross I run 
 Holding high my chains undone 
 Now I am finally free 
 Free to be what I've become 
 Undone 
 Hallelujah I'm undone! 
 To the cross I run 
 Holding high my chains undone 
 Now I am finally free 
 Free to be what I've become 
 To the cross I run 
 Holding high my chains undone 
 Now I am finally free 
 Free to be what I've become 
 Undone 
 To the cross I run 
 To be what I've become 
 And I'm undone

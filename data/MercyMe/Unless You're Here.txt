Chaos surrounds me, unless You're here 
 My heart has nothing, unless You're here 
 The blind lead the blind, unless You're here 
 My dreams are left behind, unless You're here 
 But there's hope not just for tomorrow 
 But for today 
 While Your mercy takes the sorrow 
 And You show us with Your grace 
 That You're here 
 Songs have no meaning, unless You're here 
 No reason for singing, unless You're here 
 My best will never do, unless You're here 
 'Cause it would not include You, unless You're here 
 But there's hope not just for tomorrow 
 But for today 
 While Your mercy takes the sorrow 
 And You show us with Your grace 
 That You're here 
 Hearts will not be changed, unless You're here 
 Our hope pursued in vain, unless You're here 
 But there's hope not just for tomorrow 
 But for today 
 While Your mercy takes the sorrow 
 And You show us with Your grace 
 That there's hope not just for tomorrow 
 But for today 
 While Your mercy takes the sorrow 
 And You show us with Your grace 
 That You're here 
 That You're here 
 That You're here

I don't, have to know you, just to know you 
 Have been lied to at some point or place 
 Well, I can relate 
 And you're wondering, if it's worth it 
 Heartbroken, feeling worthless 
 Oh the hurt is too great 
 Like a punch in the face 
 But don't forget 
 We've got something else in common 
 Bigger than all our pain and all our problems 
 This goes out to anyone down for the count 
 It's not over 
 Don't give up, don't throw in the towel 
 Just remember, who you belong to 
 Let Me remind you 
 How this ends 
 We win 
 Woah, we win 
 We get pushed down, we get beat up 
 So afraid life's gonna keep us 
 Up against the ropes 
 But hang on there's hope 
 'Cause if Christ is inside us it won't be a fair fight 
 'Cause Deep down we know 
 How the story goes 
 This goes out to anyone down for the count 
 It's not over 
 Don't give up, don't throw in the towel 
 Just remember, who you belong to 
 Let Me remind you 
 How this ends 
 We win 
 Woah, we win 
 We win 
 Woah, we win 
 Ain't no stopping us 
 He's not done with us 
 We are more 
 More than conquerors 
 Ain't no stopping us 
 He's not done with us 
 We, are 
 More than conquerors! 
 Just remember, who you belong to 
 Let Me remind you 
 How this ends 
 We win 
 Woah, we win 
 We win 
 Woah, we win 
 Ain't no stopping us 
 He's not done with us 
 We are more 
 More than conquerors 
 Ain't no stopping us 
 He's not done with us 
 We, are 
 More than conquerors! 
 Ain't no stopping us 
 He's not done with us 
 We are more 
 More than conquerors 
 Ain't no stopping us 
 He's not done with us 
 We, are 
 More than conquerors!

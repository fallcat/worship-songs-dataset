Got to live right 
 Just stay in line" 
 You've heard it all at least a million times 
 And like me you believed it. 
 They said it wasn't works 
 But trying harder wouldn't hurt. 
 It sounds so crazy now 
 But back then you couldn't see it 
 But now here you are 
 Eyes open wide 
 It's like you're seeing grace 
 In a brand new light 
 For the First time 
 Let us be the first to welcome you 
 Welcome to the 
 Life you thought was too good to be true 
 Welcome to the new. 
 Welcome to the 
 Welcome to the new 
 You broke your back 
 Kept all the rules 
 Jumped through the hoops 
 To make God approve of you 
 Oh tell me was it worth it 
 The whole time you were spinning plates 
 Did you stop to think that maybe He is ok with just you? 
 There's no need to join the circus 
 But now here you are 
 A new point of view 
 And now it all makes sense 
 Why it's called the Good News 
 Yeah 
 Look at you 
 Shiny and new 
 Look at you 
 You got the proof of purchase 
 You were purchased 
 'Cause you're worth it! 
 Look at you 
 Finding your groove 
 Don't you dare think 
 That you're not worth it, 
 'Cause you're worth it 
 Yeah you're worth it. 
 Welcome to the new 
 We've been waiting for you 
 Welcome to the new

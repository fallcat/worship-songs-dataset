When I survey the wondrous cross 
 On which the Prince of Glory died 
 My richest gain I count but loss 
 And pour contempt on all my pride 
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast 
 Save in the death of Christ, my God 
 All the vain things that charm me most 
 I sacrificed them to His blood 
 See from His head, His hands, His feet 
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down 
 Did ere such love and sorrow meet 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown 
 Were the whole realm of nature mine 
 That were present far too small 
 Oh, love so amazing, so divine 
 Demands my soul, my life, my all 
 Demands my soul, my life, my all 
 Demands my soul, my life, my all

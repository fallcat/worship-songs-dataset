When I first spoke Your name 
 I used it like a blade 
 Cutting sharp a mask to hide the pain 
 When I first spoke Your name 
 When I next spoke Your name 
 I could no longer bear the weight 
 Of years hiding behind the ache 
 When I next spoke Your name 
 But when You spoke my name 
 Oh I swear the angels sang 
 Peace came and stole my shame 
 When You spoke my name 
 Now when I speak Your name 
 I sing it like a sweet refrain 
 I have found a peace I can't explain 
 When I speak Your name 
 'Cause when You spoke my name 
 Oh I swear the angels sang 
 Peace came and stole my shame 
 When You spoke my name 
 I can hardly speak 
 Knowing You know me 
 Thank God I'm free 
 Now my world has completely come undone 
 For I can hear the Son 
 Calling out to me 
 'Cause when You spoke my name 
 Oh I swear the angels sang 
 Peace came and stole my shame 
 When You spoke my name 
 Oh I swear the angels sang 
 Peace came and stole my shame 
 When You spoke my name

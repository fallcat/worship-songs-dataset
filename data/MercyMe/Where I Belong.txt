Everybody hopes 
 That maybe somewhere down this road 
 We'd finally find that place where we belong 
 That place where we're complete 
 The one that occupies our dreams 
 That place we're lucky to call our home 
 Well I have arrived 
 And I can't keep this inside 
 So I raise my hands 
 And shout Your name 
 To praise You with my song 
 My dream's at hand 
 I've found my place 
 The place where I belong 
 Everybody tries 
 To find the purpose for their life 
 In hopes that one more day is justified 
 But once you truly see 
 The very reason why you breathe 
 It becomes so much more than getting by 
 Well I have arrived 
 And I can't keep this inside

What is life? 
 A thousand roads, a thousand ways 
 Why am I so afraid to move 
 I crossed the line 
 I'm stepping out so come what may 
 I give it all 'cause I'm drawn to You 
 As long as my heart is beating... 
 Where You lead me I will follow 
 Where You lead me I give my life away 
 Where You lead me I will follow 
 Forever and a day 
 Forever and a day 
 I can't deny Your very presence is my life 
 And why would I ever turn away 
 Cause deep inside I know that I cannot rely 
 On anything less than faith 
 As long as my heart is beating... 
 Where You lead me I will follow 
 Where You lead me I give my life away 
 Where You lead me I will follow 
 Forever and a day 
 This is all I'm dreaming of 
 To live completely in Your love 
 So this is life 
 Where You lead me I give my life away 
 Where You lead me I will follow 
 Forever and a day 
 Where You lead me I will follow 
 Where You lead me I give my life away 
 Where You lead me I will follow 
 Forever and a day 
 Forever and a day

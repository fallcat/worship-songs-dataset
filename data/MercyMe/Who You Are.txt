(Who You are!) 
 (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!) 
 The sky around me is turning black 
 I can't see ahead of me and I can't see back 
 I've been going for miles and miles 
 Lord, please tell me, is this worthwhile? 
 I don't know 
 Like a travelling circus, the painted town 
 Painted smiles are on every frown 
 Lord, I'm sick of all these masks 
 The naked truth is all I ask of You 
 Can't they see me for who You are? 
 Can't they see me for who You are? 
 It seems that falling down is a past time of mine 
 Take my dirty water, Lord, and change it into wine 
 Heal my wounds but don't take my scars 
 Let them see me for who You are 
 Let my heart smile upon me now 
 Eternal joy, why don't you hang around? 
 All the earth is what I see 
 The inheritance of the blessed me, oh yeah 
 What if I'm the only glance of You they see? 
 What if how I live of what I say 
 Persuades their eternity? 
 Can't they see me for who You are? 
 Can't they see me for who You are? 
 It seems that falling down is a past time of mine 
 Take my dirty water, Lord, and change it into wine 
 The sky around me is getting thin 
 I see what's ahead of me and I have no fear 
 I'll keep going for miles and miles 
 'Cause the Lord said it's all worthwhile 
 Heal my wounds but don't take my scars 
 Let them see me for who You are 
 Let them see me for who You are 
 Let them see me for who You are

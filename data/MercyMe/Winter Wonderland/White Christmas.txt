Sleigh bells ring are you listening 
 In the lane snow is glistening 
 A beautiful sight we're happy tonight 
 Walking in a winter wonderland 
 Gone away is the bluebird 
 Here to stay is a new bird 
 He sings a love song 
 As we go along 
 Walking in a winter wonderland 
 In the meadow we can build a snowman 
 Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
 He'll say are you married 
 We'll say no man 
 But you can do the job when you're in town 
 Later on we'll conspire 
 As we dream by the fire 
 To face unafraid the plans that we made 
 Walking in a winter wonderland 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
 Just like the ones I used to know 
 Where the treetops glisten and children listen 
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
 With every Christmas card I write 
 May your days be merry and bright 
 And may all your Christmases be white 
 Oh may your days be merry 
 And your yuletide be merry 
 And may all your Christmases be white 
 And may your Christmases be white 
 Have a white Christmas 
 A white Christmas, a white Christmas 
 May your wonderland be white 
 May your wonderland be white 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Happy New Year 
 Hallelujah

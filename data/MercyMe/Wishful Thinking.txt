Lord is it possible to get this far 
 And just now understand who You are? 
 I'm feeling foolish yet relieved as well 
 'Cause what I bought before, I just can't sell 
 But now my eyes are open wide 
 If this is wrong 
 I don't wanna be right 
 Could it be that on my worst day 
 How You love me still will not change 
 What if it's really not about 
 What I do but what you did, oh what if 
 This ain't wishful thinking it's just how it is 
 This ain't wishful thinking it's just how it is 
 Well, I guess I'm better late than not at all 
 Or did you plan it this way all along 
 'Cause without suffering grace is hard to see 
 So maybe I'm right where I'm supposed to be 
 And now, I'm seeing You so differently 
 And only I can say is finally 
 Could it be that on my worst day 
 How you love me simply will not change 
 What if it's really not about 
 What I do but what you did, oh what if 
 This ain't wishful thinking it's just how it is 
 This ain't wishful thinking it's just how it is 
 It's just how it is 
 But now my eyes are open wide 
 If this is wrong Lord do not make me, don't you make me right 
 Now I know that on my worst day 
 The way you love me it ain't never change 
 It's never really been about what I do but what you did 
 Yes it is 
 This ain't wishful thinking it's just how it is 
 This ain't wishful thinking it's just how it is

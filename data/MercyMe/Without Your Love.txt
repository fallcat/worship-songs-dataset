All of my life 
 I've been chasing 
 After 
 What was out of my reach 
 Time after time 
 All that I thought 
 Mattered 
 Still left me incomplete 
 Now I understand 
 Now I understand 
 This isn't who I am 
 It isn't who I am 
 I could live my life out loud 
 Turn this world upside down 
 But it will never be enough 
 Without Your love 
 I could make the mountains move 
 Give everything I have for You 
 But it will never be enough 
 Without Your love 
 It's hard to believe 
 Just knowing 
 That my heart 
 Is what You came here for 
 You will never leave 
 No more working 
 Or trying 
 Can make You love me more 
 Now I understand 
 Now I understand 
 This is who I am 
 This is who I am 
 I could live my life out loud 
 Turn this world upside down 
 But it will never be enough 
 Without Your love 
 I could make the mountains move 
 Give everything I have for You 
 But it will never be enough 
 Without Your love 
 There is nothing I can say 
 Without Your love 
 There is nothing I can do 
 Without Your love 
 I cannot do anything without You 
 I could live my life out loud 
 Turn this world upside down 
 But it will never be enough 
 Without Your love 
 I could make the mountains move 
 Give everything I have for You 
 But it will never be enough 
 Without Your love 
 There is nothing I can do 
 Without Your love 
 There is nothing I can say 
 Without Your love

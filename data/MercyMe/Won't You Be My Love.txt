When you fall asleep tonight 
 In your warm and cozy room, 
 Know that I'm awake 
 And I've got no shelter and no food. 
 I am not alone. 
 My friends are broke and lost. 
 Looking for someone to lead them to my cross. 
 I need your help.  I need your help. 
 Won't you be My voice calling. 
 Won't you be My hands healing. 
 Won't you be My feet walking into a broken world. 
 Won't you be My chain breaker. 
 Won't you be My peace maker. 
 Won't you be My hope and joy. 
 Won't you be My Love. 
 The other side of the world 
 She is just a few days old. 
 A helpless little girl 
 With no family of her own. 
 She is not to blame for the journey she is on. 
 Her life is no mistake. 
 Won't you lead her to My cross? 
 Won't you be My voice calling. 
 Won't you be My hands healing. 
 Won't you be My feet walking into a broken world. 
 Won't you be My chain breaker. 
 Won't you be My peace maker. 
 Won't you be My hope and joy. 
 Won't you be My Love. 
 To those I call My own. 
 To those I've set aside 
 As spotless without blame. 
 The chosen ones My bride. 
 We will be Your voice calling. 
 We will be Your hands healing. 
 We will be Your feet walking into a broken world. 
 We will be Your chain breaker. 
 We will be Your peace maker. 
 We will be Your hope and joy. 
 We will be Your love. 
 We will be Your love. 
 We will be Your love. 
 We will be Your love. 
 We will be Your love. 
 We will be Your love. 
 We will be Your love. 
 Your love 
 We will be Your love.

I've been the one 
 To shake with fear 
 And wonder if 
 You're even here 
 I've been the one 
 To doubt Your love 
 I've told myself 
 You're not enough 
 I've been the one 
 To try and say 
 I'll overcome 
 By my own strength 
 I've been the one 
 To fall apart 
 And start to question 
 Who You are 
 You're the One who conquers giants 
 You're the One who calls out kings 
 You shut the mouths of lions 
 You tell the dead to breathe 
 You're the One who walks through fire 
 You take the orphan's hand 
 You are the One Messiah 
 You are I Am 
 I've been the one 
 Held down in chains 
 Beneath the weight 
 Of all my shame 
 I've been the one 
 To believe 
 That where I am 
 You cannot reach 
 You're the One who conquers giants 
 You're the One who calls out kings 
 You shut the mouths of lions 
 You tell the dead to breathe 
 You're the One who walks through fire 
 You take the orphan's hand 
 You are the One Messiah 
 You are I Am 
 You are I Am 
 The veil is torn 
 And now I live 
 With the Spirit inside 
 The same One 
 The very same One 
 Who brought the Son 
 Back to life 
 Hallelujah, He lives in me 
 Hallelujah, He lives in me 
 Hallelujah, He lives in me 
 Hallelujah, He lives in me 
 You're the One who conquers giants 
 You're the One who calls out kings 
 You shut the mouths of lions 
 You tell the dead to breathe 
 You're the One who walks through fire 
 You take the orphan's hand 
 You are the One Messiah 
 You are I Am 
 (Hallelujah, He lives in me) 
 You are I Am 
 (Hallelujah, He lives in me)

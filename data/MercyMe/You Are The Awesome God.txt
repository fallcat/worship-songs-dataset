You're my strength 
 And you are my salvation 
 I will put my trust in you 
 My heart sings 
 In you my soul rejoices 
 In this song of praise to you 
 You are the awesome God 
 You are the great I am 
 The only living word 
 Wonderful counselor 
 You are the awesome God 
 You are the first and last 
 The only living word 
 Age to age still the same 
 Awesome God 
 (Repeat first verse again)

So many wasted days. 
 Thinking all I've done is all that I am. 
 So many lonely nights on my own. 
 But it's a funny thing. 
 You see my heart so differently. 
 No matter what I feel or where I go 
 I still don't quite understand 
 How all of my yesterdays. 
 All of my past mistakes. 
 You've thrown them all away. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all. 
 No matter what I do. 
 What I am going through. 
 It's already died with You. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all. 
 Old me is out the door. 
 He won't be living here anymore. 
 You simply spoke my name and set me free. 
 I still just can't believe. 
 When I was lost and running away. 
 That You would see a heart worth redeeming 
 And I'll never quite understand 
 How all of my yesterdays. 
 All of my past mistakes. 
 You've thrown them all away. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all. 
 No matter what I do. 
 What I am going through. 
 It's already died with You. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all. 
 How is it that I am Yours and You're mine. 
 Why would You know me. 
 When I'm so unworthy of mercy and You're divine. 
 You still made me holy. 
 (You don't care) 
 All of my yesterdays. 
 All of my past mistakes. 
 You've thrown them all away. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all. 
 No matter what I do. 
 What I am going through. 
 It's already died with You. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all. 
 All of my yesterdays. 
 All of my past mistakes. 
 You've thrown them all away. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all. 
 No matter what I do. 
 What I am going through. 
 It's already died with You. 
 You don't care at all. 
 You don't care at all.

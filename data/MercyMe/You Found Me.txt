When I was a child, I spoke just like a child 
 Playing childish games, just like hide-and-seek 
 Doing everything tryna to hide my shame 
 That's when I heard Your voice calling out to me 
 1, 2, 3, no need for hiding 
 4, 5, 6, it's already forgotten 
 7, 8, 9, 10, if you're ready or not 
 Here I come 
 You... 
 You found me 
 You... 
 You found me 
 Never, never, never, gonna be the same 
 Ever, ever, ever, since that day 
 You... 
 You found me 
 (You found me, You found me) 
 You... 
 You found me 
 (You found me, You found me) 
 Every now and then, I will look in the mirror 
 And I see that kid, looking back at me 
 Suddenly I'm thinking back to the moment 
 When I heard Your voice changing everything 
 Come out, come out, wherever you are 
 Your greatest wound, is barely a scar 
 You're free indeed, no matter what you do 
 Now that I found You!.. 
 You... 
 You found me 
 You... 
 You found me 
 Never, never, never, gonna be the same 
 Ever, ever, ever, since that day 
 You... 
 You found me 
 (You found me, You found me) 
 You... 
 You found me 
 (You found me, You found me) 
 I am yours, and You are mine 
 You will never have to hide 
 Before the heavens, before the earth 
 I knew exactly where you were 
 And I am yours, and You are mine! 
 Only You are Lord! 
 You are mine! 
 You... 
 You found me 
 You... 
 You found me 
 Never, never, never, gonna be the same 
 Ever, ever, ever, since that day 
 You... 
 You found me 
 (You found me, You found me) 
 You... 
 You found me 
 (You found me, You found me) 
 You found me, You found me 
 You found me, You found me...

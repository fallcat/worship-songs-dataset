You'd think I'd know by now 
 Who's running the show 
 And what really matters. 
 But I keep picking a fight. 
 With "letting go" 
 And keep getting hammered 
 It's a knock down. 
 Drag out. 
 Oh and I am face down. 
 For the count. 
 And I'm reminded. 
 I'm not the one in control. 
 I know You know better so 
 Why don't I go whenever 
 You say come follow wherever You lead. 
 So won't You help me 
 Would You wake me up 
 And make me aware 
 Of what You are doing. 
 And from my point of view 
 It's not very clear 
 Where this is going 
 But it's Your call. 
 Help me understand. 
 It's not how I fall. 
 But where I land. 
 So I'm reminded 
 I'm not the one in control. 
 I know You know better so 
 Why don't I go whenever 
 You say come follow wherever You lead. 
 So won't You help me 
 Whatever You have in store. 
 Whatever I am in for. 
 I want to trust You more and more and more... 
 Oh oh oh oh, You know better 
 Oh oh oh oh, You know better 
 And I know You know better so 
 Why don't I go whenever 
 You say come follow wherever You lead. 
 (I know You know better so) 
 I know You know better so 
 Why don't I go whenever 
 You say come follow wherever You lead. 
 So won't You help me 
 I know You know better 
 I know You know better...

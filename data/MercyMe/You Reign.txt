Even before there was a drop in the ocean 
 Even before there was a star in the sky 
 Even before the world was put in motion 
 You were on Your throne 
 You were on Your throne 
 You reign 
 Glory in the highest, You reign 
 Let creation testify by Your name 
 Every knee will bow 
 And every tongue proclaim 
 That Jesus reigns 
 Even before Your hand made the heavens 
 Even before the breath of all mankind 
 Even before we had to be forgiven 
 You were on Your throne 
 You were on Your throne 
 Yesterday, today and forever 
 You are God who was, and is 
 And is to come

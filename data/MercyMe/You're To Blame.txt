I'm not one to pass the blame 
 But this is one I cannot claim even if I wanted to 
 There's something happening 
 There's something going on with me 
 And I think I like the view from where I'm standing 
 You are to blame for anything that is good in my heart 
 You are to blame for this change that has taken me by storm 
 There's one thing I am wondering 
 What exactly do You see that makes you want to stay 
 I don't deserve Your attention 
 Why would You ever mention me 
 Why You're treating me this way remains a mystery 
 And I feel like I can fly 
 Just knowing I am Yours 
 And knowing that You're mine 
 I cannot ask for more

Lord it was you 
 Who created the heavens 
 Lord it was your hand 
 That put the stars in their place 
 Lord it was your voice 
 That commands the morning 
 Even oceans and their waves 
 Bow at your feet 
 Lord who am I 
 Compared to your glory Oh Lord 
 Lord who am I compared to your majesty 
 I'm your beloved 
 Your creation 
 And you love me as I am 
 You have called me chosen 
 For your kingdom 
 Unashamed to call me your own 
 I'm your beloved 
 Lord it was you 
 Who created the heavens 
 Lord it was your hand 
 That put the stars in their place 
 Lord it was your voice 
 That commands the morning 
 Even oceans and their waves 
 Bow at your feet 
 Lord who am I 
 Compared to glory Oh Lord 
 Lord who am I 
 Compared to your majesty 
 I'm your beloved 
 Your creation 
 And you love me as I am 
 You have called me chosen 
 For your kingdom 
 Unashamed to call me your own 
 I'm your beloved 
 I am your beloved one 
 Oh yea 
 One you've called chosen 
 Woa woa 
 I'm your beloved 
 Your Creation 
 And you love me as I am 
 You have called me chosen 
 For your kingdom 
 Unashamed to call me your own 
 I'm your beloved

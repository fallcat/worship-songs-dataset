Well I'm amazed 
 By Your wondrous glory 
 Struck by the way it's consuming me 
 And I embrace 
 This feeling deep within me 
 Worshipping You is my destiny 
 There's no end to Your majesty 
 Your glory goes on and on and on and on 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 It keeps going on and on and on and on 
 Forever will Your glory reign 
 No matter what 
 I'm gonna keep on living 
 Even when times get the best of me 
 Cause I'm in love 
 With the King of heaven 
 Whose Glory goes on for eternity 
 And I will proclaim so that all the world will see 
 Your glory goes on and on and on and on 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 It keeps going on and on and on and on 
 Forever will Your glory reign 
 Lord I tremble with the truth 
 That You think of me 
 There's no end to what You'll do 
 For Your glory 
 Your glory goes on and on and on and on 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 It keeps going on and on and on and on 
 Forever will Your glory reign 
 Your glory goes on and on and on and on 
 It's never gonna fade away 
 It keeps going on and on and on and on 
 Forever will Your glory reign

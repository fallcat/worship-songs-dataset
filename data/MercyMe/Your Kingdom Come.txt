We long to sit at Your feet 
 We long to see Your face 
 We long to smell the rain of Your anointing 
 And we long to be in You 
 Hear our hearts, oh, hear our voice 
 To You, oh, God, we will rejoice 
 We are Your bride and we wear Your ring 
 Until Your return we will sing 
 That we long to see You, yeah, yeah 
 We long to sit at Your feet 
 We long to see Your face 
 We long to smell the rain of Your anointing 
 And we long to be in You 
 Hear our hearts, oh, hear our voice 
 To You, oh, God, we will rejoice 
 We are Your bride and we wear Your ring 
 Until Your return we will sing 
 That we long to see You 
 To see You, to see You 
 Yeah, to see You, to see You, yeah 
 To see You, yeah 
 How much longer shall we wait 
 Till we finally see the sun? 
 Break through the eastern gate 
 And let Your kingdom come 
 How much longer shall we wait 
 Till we finally see the sun? 
 Break through the eastern gate 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Let Your kingdom come, yeah 
 Let Your kingdom come, yeah 
 Your kingdom come, yeah, yeah 
 (Hallelujah to the Lamb) 
 (Hallelujah to the Lamb)

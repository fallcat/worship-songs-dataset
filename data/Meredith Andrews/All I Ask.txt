Give me eyes to see when my heart is blind 
 That when I ask You'll give, that when I seek I'll find 
 Give me ears to hear when my way's confused 
 Let the uncertain road, still lead me back to You 
 Oh, oh 
 All I ask, all I seek 
 Is You, is You 
 All I want, all I need 
 Is You 
 Give me melodies in the silence, Lord 
 And let the fire be where every song is forged 
 Give me faith to trust in Your promises 
 That You are truly good, that You are all You said You are 
 Hh, oh 
 All I ask, all I seek 
 Is You, is You 
 All I want, and all I need 
 Is You, is You 
 All I ask, all I seek 
 Is You, is You 
 All I want, all I need 
 Is You 
 Whom have I in Heaven but You? 
 Whom have I on Earth besides You? 
 Whom have I in Heaven but You? 
 Whom have I in Heaven but You? 
 Whom have I on Earth besides You? 
 Whom have I in Heaven but You? 
 Whom have I but You, God? 
 All I ask, all I seek 
 Is You, is You 
 All I want, all I need 
 Is You, is You 
 All I ask, all I seek 
 Is You, is You 
 All I want, all I need 
 Is You

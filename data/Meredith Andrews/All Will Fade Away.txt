In this world we will struggle 
 But You have overcome the world 
 In this life we will stumble 
 But our future is secure 
 There is hope in suffering 
 There is life beyond what we see 
 All of this will disappear 
 We are strangers here 
 We are strangers here 
 We will see You face to face 
 And all will fade away 
 Yes, all will fade away 
 Our moments are fleeting 
 Every breath could be our last 
 These things that we're holding 
 Will only wither like the grass 
 There's no end of time with You 
 No treasure here compares to You 
 Caught up, caught up with You my Jesus 
 Caught up caught up with You forever 
 In love in love with You my Jesus 
 In love in love with You forever

I'm tired, do I have to keep proving myself 
 I'm weary and drawing from and empty well 
 I need You more than I ever have 
 So Jesus come and shatter my darkness somehow 
 I won't speak until You speak 
 I won't move until You move me 
 I won't sing, sing over me 
 I will wait as long as it takes 
 I'm restless for something significant 
 But I'm helpless 'cause I've done all I can 
 I want You more than I ever have 
 So Jesus come and hold me, I'm shaking right now 
 You are the Comforter so comfort me 
 You're the Sustainer so be enough for me 
 You are my Father and Your love for me 
 Is where I find my rest

Only You, only You 
 All I need, let nothing stand 
 In between, make me Yours 
 Consuming fire 
 Only You, only You 
 All I need, let nothing stand 
 In between, make me Yours 
 Consuming fire 
 Burn away 
 Everything that breaks Your heart 
 Everything that is not love 
 Purify my every thought 
 Take away 
 Everything that comes between us 
 Everything that is untrue 
 Jesus make me more like You 
 Burn away 
 You are love, You are love 
 Blazing light, holy flame 
 Fierce and wild, have Your way 
 Consuming fire 
 Yes You are love, You are love 
 Blazing light, holy flame 
 Fierce and wild, have Your way 
 Consuming fire 
 Burn away 
 Everything that breaks Your heart 
 Everything that is not love 
 Purify my every thought 
 Take away 
 Everything that comes between us 
 Everything that is untrue 
 Jesus make me more like You 
 Make me holy, as You are holy 
 Refine me in your fire, oh God 
 Make me holy, as You are holy 
 In my life be glorified 
 Make me holy, as You are holy 
 Refine me in your fire, oh God 
 Make me holy, as You are holy 
 In my life be glorified 
 Burn away 
 Everything that breaks Your heart 
 Everything that is not love 
 Purify my every thought 
 And take away 
 Everything that comes between us 
 Everything that is untrue 
 Jesus make me more like You 
 Burn away 
 Burn away 
 Consuming fire 
 Burn away

I'm staring at these empty walls 
 Wondering when You'll visit me again 
 When will You come 
 If there is anything at all 
 Coming in between our love 
 Please show me 
 'Cause I am barely hanging on 
 Can anybody hear me 
 The silence is deafening 
 Why do You feel so far away 
 I know You're here with me 
 But I just need the faith to see 
 Nothing can separate me 
 From Your love 
 Believing what I can't see 
 Has never come naturally to me 
 And I've got questions 
 But I am certain of a love 
 Strong enough to hold me 
 When I'm doubting 
 You'll never let go of my hand 
 I will trust in You 
 Even in the moments I can't find You 
 I will hold onto 
 Your promises, Oh Lord 
 You've never failed before 
 I know that You can hear me 
 When the silence is deafening 
 Even though You seem far away 
 I know You're here with me 
 But I just need the faith to see 
 Nothing can separate me from Your love

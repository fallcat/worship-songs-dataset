It hurts me to see you this way 
 I can't sleep, I'm lying awake 
 Wondering what you're battling tonight 
 You've bought into all of the lies 
 And you've buried your fears inside 
 Haunted by a past you can't erase 
 What will it take 
 There's no mistaking 
 Only one place you belong 
 Please come home 
 Please come home 
 The door is open wide 
 You don't have to fix your life for me 
 I die a little every time that you leave 
 So come home 
 Your voice rings inside my ears 
 I'm fighting to hold back the tears 
 How can I make you see while there's still time 
 What will it take 
 There's no mistaking 
 Only one place you belong 
 You're not a disappointment to me 
 You're just like the rest of us 
 Struggling through the journey 
 I don't care what secrets you may keep 
 I could never love you less 
 Than all the love inside of me

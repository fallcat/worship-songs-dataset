I have kicked up the dust and the dirt on the narrow road 
 I have had to let go of some hurt to hold on to hope 
 I’ve watched the sunset before the promise came 
 I have waded through waters wide and walked through the flame 
 And I can say 
 Every valley made me lift my eyes up 
 Every burden only made me stronger 
 Every sorrow only made Your joy go 
 Deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper 
 I will run like I’m out to win and finish the race 
 For every battle that’s sure to come I will be brave 
 I’ve got my heart set on every word You say 
 And no matter what lies ahead You’ll make a way 
 And I will say 
 Every valley made me lift my eyes up 
 Every burden only made me stronger 
 Every sorrow only made Your joy go 
 Deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper 
 Every mountain is making me a climber 
 Every giant is calling out a fighter 
 Every heartache only makes Your love go 
 Deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper 
 Thrown down, but not defeated 
 I’m worn out, but not giving up 
 I’ve hit ground, but even at rock bottom 
 I’m just getting started 
 Yeah, I’m just getting started 
 Thrown down, but not defeated 
 I’m worn out, but not giving up 
 I’ve hit ground, but even at rock bottom 
 I’m just getting started 
 Yeah, I’m just getting started 
 Every valley made me lift my eyes up 
 (Eyes up, eyes up) 
 I lift my eyes up 
 You're taking me deeper and deeper 
 Deeper and deeper 
 Every mountain is making me a climber 
 Every giant is calling out a fighter 
 Every heartache only makes Your love go 
 Deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper 
 Deeper

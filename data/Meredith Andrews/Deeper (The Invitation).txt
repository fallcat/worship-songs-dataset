I've been wading in shallow water 
 You're the ocean I am after 
 And I wanna go, oh, I wanna go with You 
 Break the silence with Your whisper 
 Take my hand and pull me under 
 'Cause I wanna go, oh, I wanna go with You 
 So 
 Take me deeper, take me deeper 
 To where You are that I may find You 
 Take me further, take me further 
 Than where I've been 
 I wanna be with You, be with You, oh 
 Settling for what my eyes see 
 Help me believe, help me break free 
 'Cause I wanna go, oh, I wanna go with You 
 Yeah 
 Take me deeper, take me deeper 
 To where You are that I may find You 
 Take me further, take me further 
 Than where I've been 
 I wanna be with You, be with You, oh 
 Take me through the desert places 
 For the chance to see Your face and 
 Take me past the breaking waves 
 Into the depth of Your embrace 
 Take me through the desert places 
 For the chance to see Your face and 
 Take me past the breaking waves 
 Into the depth of Your embrace 
 Your embrace 
 Take me deeper, take me deeper 
 To where You are that I may find You 
 Take me further, take me further 
 Than where I've been, I wanna be with 
 Take me deeper, take me deeper 
 To where You are that I may find You 
 Take me further, take me further 
 Than where I've been 
 I wanna be with You, be with You 
 I wanna be with You, be with You, oh

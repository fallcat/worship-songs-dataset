For your nearness, Lord, I hunger 
 For your nearness, Lord, I wait 
 Hold me ever closer Father 
 Such a love I can't escape 
 For your nearness I am hoping 
 For your nearness, Lord, I long 
 Have no need of any other 
 I have found where I belong 
 Yes, I have found where I belong 
 So draw me nearer, Lord 
 Never let me go 
 Closer to your heart 
 Draw me nearer, Lord 
 Draw me nearer, Lord 
 In your nearness there is healing 
 What was broken, now made whole 
 Restoration in its fullness 
 Lasting hope for all who come 
 In your nearness I take shelter 
 Where you are is where I'm home 
 I have need of only one thing 
 To be here before your throne 
 To be here before you throne 
 So draw me nearer, Lord 
 Never let me go 
 Closer to your heart 
 Draw me nearer, Lord 
 So draw me nearer, Lord 
 Never let me go 
 Closer to your heart 
 Draw me nearer, Lord 
 Draw me nearer, Lord 
 And keep me here, keep me here 
 There's nowhere else I rather be 
 So keep me here, keep me here 
 There's nowhere else I rather be 
 There's nowhere else I rather be 
 So draw me nearer, Lord 
 Never let me go 
 Closer to your heart 
 Draw me nearer, Lord 
 Draw me nearer, Lord 
 Draw me nearer, my Lord

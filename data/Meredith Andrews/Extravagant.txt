When I think of all you've done 
 Every battle you have won 
 Who has seen a greater love 
 There is not one 
 There is not one 
 Your mercy deeper than the seas 
 Your grace God washes over me 
 Your faithfulness like the rising sun 
 O' the wonder of your love 
 So Extravagant 
 So Extravagant 
 Countless are the reasons why 
 You are good and you are kind 
 More than all in you I find 
 You are enough 
 Always enough 
 Your mercy deeper than the seas 
 Your grace God washes over me 
 Your faithfulness like the rising sun 
 O' the wonder of your love 
 So Extravagant 
 So Extravagant 
 When I needed a Savior you were there, you were there 
 When I needed a healer you were there 
 When I needed a Father you were there, you were always there 
 When I needed a Savoir you were there, you were there 
 When I needed a healer you were there 
 When I needed a Father you were there, you were always there 
 Your mercy deeper than the seas 
 You grace God washes over me 
 Your faithfulness like the rising sun 
 O' the wonder of your love 
 Your mercy deeper than the seas 
 Your grace God washes over me 
 Your faithfulness like the rising sun 
 O' the wonder of your love 
 So Extravagant 
 So Extravagant 
 So Extravagant 
 So Extravagant

I feel the weight of the world 
 There's a burden on my shoulders 
 Seems like I'm wasting my words 
 And my prayers are going no where 
 The light and dark are wrestling in my heart 
 A war for my affections 
 A hundred voices ringing in my head 
 A war for my attention 
 But I believe You will overcome 
 All the fear and the fight in me 
 And my suffering cannot compare 
 To the weight of Your Glory 
 Your Glory 
 Your Glory 
 Sorrow may last for the night 
 But joy comes in the morning 
 There may be heartache in life 
 But Your wounds will be my healing 
 Your love has won the battle for my soul 
 I know I'm not alone here 
 I fix my hope upon Your promises 
 I'm counting on Your mercy 
 But I believe You will overcome 
 All the fear and the fight in me 
 And my suffering cannot compare 
 To the weight of Your Glory 
 Your Glory 
 Your Glory 
 But I believe You will overcome 
 All the fear and the fight in me 
 And my suffering cannot compare 
 To the weight of Your Glory 
 Your Glory 
 Your Glory 
 But I believe You will overcome 
 All the fear and the fight in me 
 And my suffering cannot compare 
 To the weight of Your Glory 
 Your Glory 
 Your Glory

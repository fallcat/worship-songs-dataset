In the silence, in the waiting 
 With the promise in the making 
 I will cling to what I know is true 
 In the sorrow, in the struggle 
 When my heart is torn in trouble 
 I will cling to what I know is true 
 I've seen the glimpses, I've heard the whispers of all that is to come 
 My eyes will see the glory of the Lord 
 My ears will hear the mercy in His voice 
 My hands will hold the hands that are holding me 
 In the shifting, in the shadows 
 When my fears tempt me to follow 
 I will cling to what I know is true 
 I've seen the glimpses, I've heard the whispers of all that is to come 
 My eyes will see the glory of the Lord 
 My ears will hear the mercy in His voice 
 My hands will hold the hands that are holding me 
 My feet will walk into the promised land 
 And I will know the beauty of His plan 
 My hands will hold the hands that are holding me 
 I will see your goodness 
 I will see the coming of the promise 
 I believe that you restore the broken parts of me 
 I will see your goodness 
 I will see the coming of the promise 
 I believe that you restore the broken parts of me 
 Well I will see your goodness 
 I will see the coming of the promise 
 I believe that everything will one day be redeemed 
 My eyes will see the glory of the Lord 
 My ears will hear the mercy in His voice 
 My hands will hold the hands that are holding me 
 My feet will walk into the promised land 
 And I will know the beauty os His plan 
 My hands will hold the hands that are holding me 
 The hands that are holding me 
 The hands that are holding me

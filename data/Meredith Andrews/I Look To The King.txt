On the battle field 
 Where the fight is weighed 
 My enemy is real 
 And my courage faides 
 I lift my eyes, I lift my eyes 
 Where does my help come from? 
 I look to the king 
 Eternal, emortal, invincible God 
 I stand on the rock, of ages 
 My savior, he conquered it all 
 (2x's) I look to the king 
 On the battle field 
 Of all that lies ahead 
 Here your blood will spill 
 A greater word than death 
 (2x's) I lift my eyes 
 Where does my help come from? 
 (All 2x's) I look to the king. Eternal, emortal, invincible God. I stand on the rock, of ages. My savior, he conquered it all 
 I look to the king 
 (2x's) Victorious 
 Reigning over us 
 Forevermore 
 Victorious 
 You alone are 
 Victorious 
 Reigning over us 
 Forevermore 
 (All 2x's) I look to the king. Eternal, emortal, invincible God. I stand on the rock, of ages. My savior, he conquered it all 
 (2x's) I look to the king

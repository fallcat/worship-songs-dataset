You're the one who shut the mouth of the lion 
 The God who put the giant in the grave 
 With your hand you turned the ocean into dry land 
 All to save 
 You opened up the eyes of the blind man 
 You're the one who calmed the storm and walked on waves 
 You rose and left an empty tomb behind you 
 All to save, All to save 
 It's impossible for you to fail me 
 There's not a day that you won't go before me 
 Even when I'm at the end, I will not forget 
 It's impossible for you to fail 
 It's impossible for you to fail 
 Your love is deep enough to find me in the valley 
 And strong enough to lift me from my shame 
 A Holy King who freely gives me mercy 
 All to save, All to save 
 It's impossible for you to fail me 
 There's not a day that you won't go before me 
 Even when I'm at the end, I will not forget 
 It's impossible for you to fail 
 It's impossible for you to fail 
 Though I stumble and doubt, you are here even now 
 Forever Faithful, Forever Faithful 
 Though I can't always see, I will choose to believe 
 That you are Faithful, Forever Faithful 
 It's impossible for you to fail me 
 There's not a day that you won't go before me 
 Even when I'm at the end, I will not forget 
 It's impossible for you to fail 
 It's impossible for you to fail 
 It's impossible for you to fail

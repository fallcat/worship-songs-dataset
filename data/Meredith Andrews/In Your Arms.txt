I'm turning the world off 
 Embracing the silence 
 Walking away from all the voices 
 That are Screaming in my ear 
 I've been too caught up 
 I've been so stressed out 
 All of the noise replaced the whisper 
 That used to be so clear 
 So I close every door 
 Put my face back on the floor 
 And I'm in Your arms 
 Where I belong 
 There's no other place for me 
 Than right where You are 
 Some things just don't change 
 When I call Your name 
 You never hesitate to wrap me in endless grace 
 When I'm in Your arms 
 I'm letting my fears go 
 Giving You control 
 For You are the one who holds me closer 
 In my soul's darkest night 
 Everything I see 
 Is so temporary 
 So help me to run the race before me 
 With eternity in sight 
 Now I close every door 
 Put my face back on the floor 
 To sit at Your feet 
 At Your table of mercy 
 To gaze on Your beauty, my Lord 
 To drink from Your well 
 And be changed by Your glory 
 How could I ask for more 
 Jesus, how could I ask for more

Lift up your head 
 Lift up your eyes 
 Let us soar as the one draw near 
 To the one who meets us here 
 Let us all fall down 
 Before the god who rescues us in 
 Lift up your head and throw off every chain 
 Lift up your eyes to the one who doesn't change 
 Lift up your hands, the broken he will mend 
 Lift up your head 
 Let us all fix our gaze on the offer of our faith 
 From what else we turn away 
 For the joy, that conquers shame 
 Lift up your head and throw off every chain 
 Lift up your eyes to the one who doesn't change 
 Lift up your hands, the broken he will mend 
 Lift up your head 
 He is lover 
 He is redeemer 
 He is father 
 He is friend 
 He is our shelter 
 He is our healer 
 He is the lifter of our heads 
 He is lover 
 He is redeemer 
 He is father 
 He is friend 
 He is our shelter 
 He is our healer 
 He is the lifter of our heads 
 Lift up your head 
 Lift up your eyes. 
 Lift up your head and throw off every chain 
 Lift up your eyes to the one who doesn't change 
 Lift up your hands, the broken he will mend 
 So lift up your head

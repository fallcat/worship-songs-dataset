I'm still trying to untangle 
 The voices in my head 
 While I'm digging through the rubble 
 To find what might be left 
 And I'm hoping it's the promise 
 You're not finished with me yet 
 You can fill what's empty 
 Oh to speak and to hear You speaking 
 Oh to breathe and to feel Your breath in me 
 You have always been my Maker 
 And I am just the clay 
 You can take these broken pieces 
 And use them just the same 
 And that will be Your glory 
 Oh to speak and to hear You speaking 
 Oh to breathe and to feel Your breath in me 
 To love like a fire burning 
 All consuming Father live through me 
 Set me ablaze 
 For my soul's sake 
 Set me ablaze 
 'Til only You remain 
 Oh to speak and to hear You speaking 
 Oh to breathe and to feel Your breath in me 
 To love like a fire burning 
 All consuming Father live through me

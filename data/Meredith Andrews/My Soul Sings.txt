From the void 
 Your words rang forth 
 The earth was formed 
 And life was born 
 Even then 
 You knew our sin 
 Would tear us apart 
 We would break Your heart 
 But You would redeem 
 Now My soul sings 
 For my eyes see 
 Your beauty on display 
 For all the world to see 
 Now my soul sings 
 Responding 
 To the wonder of Your love 
 At work inside of me 
 We were powerless 
 But You died for us 
 To show Your love 
 Your perfect love 
 Unsatisfied 
 Till we drank Your cup 
 It was enough 
 It's still enough 
 You're all we need 
 Infinite God, Intimate Friend 
 Your love endures, it never ends 
 Then sings my soul 
 My soul must sing 
 Of all You are to me

What love is this 
 That love should die 
 Now I am His 
 And He is mine 
 What a love came down 
 To rescue me 
 Where I was bound 
 He set me free 
 I don't need a new truth 
 All I need is more of You 
 To the cross I will run 
 For all my Savior has done 
 I will stay here and never move on 
 No other moment in time 
 So glorious, so divine 
 I will stay here and never move on 
 Held captive here 
 In awe of grace 
 Joy found in tears 
 Upon Your face 
 And all my shame 
 Just disappears 
 My guilt erased 
 When I am here 
 I don't need a new truth 
 All I need is more of You 
 Nothing in my hands I bring 
 Simply to Your cross I cling, I cling

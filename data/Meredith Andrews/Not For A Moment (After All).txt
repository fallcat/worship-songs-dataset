You were reaching through the storm 
 Walking on the water 
 Even when I could not see 
 In the middle of it all 
 When I thought You were a thousand miles away 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 After all You are constant 
 After all You are only good 
 After all You are sovereign 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 You were singing in the dark 
 Whispering Your promise 
 Even when I could not hear 
 I was held in Your arms 
 Carried for a thousand miles to show 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 After all You are constant 
 After all You are only good 
 After all You are sovereign 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 And every step, every breath, You are there 
 Every tear, every cry, every prayer 
 In my heart, at my worst, when my world falls down 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Even in the dark, even when it's hard 
 You will never leave me 
 After all 
 After all You are constant 
 After all You are only good 
 After all You are sovereign 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me

Undivided, strip everything else away 
 Burn the idols, the things in my life 
 That have replaced You 
 I lay my life down, here on Your altar 
 Empty my hands of all I've been holding back 
 Take everything I have 
 Only to be Yours Lord, Yours Lord 
 Take it from my hands 
 Until I'm holding onto only You 
 Captivated, You've stolen my heart away 
 I've been liberated the chains of this world forever broken 
 You laid Your life down 
 Now I surrender, lifting my hands 
 I'm holding nothing back 
 Everything I want is found in You 
 Every breath in me, a gift from You 
 I have nothing here apart from You 
 I am Yours Lord, Only Yours

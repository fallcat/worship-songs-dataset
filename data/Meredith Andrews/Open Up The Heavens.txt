We've waited for this day, we're gathered in Your Name 
 Calling out to You 
 Your glory like a fire awakening desire 
 Will burn our hearts with truth 
 You're the reason we're here 
 You're the reason we're singing 
 Open up the heavens, we wanna see You 
 Open up the floodgates, a mighty river 
 Flowing from Your heart and filling every part of our praise 
 Your presence in this place, Your Glory on our face, 
 We're looking to the sky. 
 Descending like a cloud, You're standing with us now, 
 Lord unveil our eyes. 
 You're the reason we're here 
 You're the reason we're singing 
 So open up the heavens, we wanna see You 
 Open up the floodgates, a mighty river 
 Flowing from Your heart and filling every part of our praise 
 Open up the heavens, we wanna see You 
 Open up the floodgates, a mighty river 
 Flowing from Your heart and filling every part of our praise 
 Show us, show us Your glory 
 Show us, show us Your power 
 Show us, show us Your glory Lord 
 Show us, show us Your glory 
 Show us, show us Your power 
 Show us, show us Your glory Lord 
 We wanna see You, we wanna see You 
 Open up the heavens, we wanna see You 
 Open up the floodgates, a mighty river 
 Flowing from Your heart and filling every part of our praise 
 Open up the heavens, we wanna see You 
 Open up the floodgates, a mighty river 
 Flowing from Your heart and filling every part of our praise

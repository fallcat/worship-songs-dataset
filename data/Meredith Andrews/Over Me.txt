Hunger, desperate, pleading for you 
 This one thing is all we seek 
 Lord, our eyes are lifted to you 
 For in the midst of tears and pain, you are 
 A comfort, an ever present help in time of our great need 
 A shelter from the storm, a refuge for the weary 
 So now, O Lord, will you be our song 
 And sing over me, Lord, sing over me? 
 May I sit here and be still 
 'Til your sweet melody 
 You sing over me 
 Trials and troubles, they surround us 
 And battles rage within our souls 
 Still you will be the one we run to 
 For in the midst of fear, Lord, you are our 
 Defender, valiant champion now for all the world to see 
 A mighty fortress is our God we know 
 You're with us 
 So now, O Lord, will you be our song 
 And singer over me, Lord, sing over me? 
 May I sit here and be still 
 'Til your sweet melody you sing 
 Of your love, of your grace, of your faithfulness, Lord 
 Though we've turned away 
 Of your truth, of your strength, forever you were, you are, you will be 
 Sing over me, Lord 
 Sing over me 
 May I sit here and be still 
 'Til your sweet melody you sing 
 Of your love, of your grace, of your faithfulness, Lord 
 Though we've turned away 
 Of your truth, of your strength; forever you were, you are, you will be 
 Of your love, of your grace, your faithfulness, Lord 
 Though we've turned away 
 Of your truth, of your strength; forever you were, you are, you will be 
 Our song 
 You will be our song, our sweetest song 
 Sing over me

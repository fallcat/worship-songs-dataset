It's a complex puzzle you call your life 
 It's an uphill climb, it's a constant fight 
 And it wears you down 
 Feeling like you're alone, like you don't belong 
 And you won't be loved if you don't measure up 
 And you wear your scars 
 Like they're who you are 
 Give Him your wounds, your bruised and broken pieces 
 All your questions, all your secrets 
 You don't have to hide who you are 
 You belong to someone greater 
 Than all your past mistakes and failures 
 Rest in who He is 
 He knows how to make your pieces fit 
 He's the light on the road when you're lost in the dark 
 And He won't run away if you show your heart 
 Wants you to believe it 
 You can taste that freedom 
 When you give Him your wounds, your bruised and broken pieces 
 All your questions, all your secrets 
 You don't have to hide who you are 
 You belong to someone greater 
 Than all your past mistakes and failures 
 Rest in who He is 
 He knows how to make your pieces fit 
 You are completely known 
 You are completely loved 
 This is where you belong 
 Give Him your wounds, your bruised and broken pieces 
 All your questions, all your secrets 
 You don't have to hide who you are 
 You belong to someone greater 
 Than all your past mistakes and failures 
 Rest in who He is 
 He knows how to make your pieces fit

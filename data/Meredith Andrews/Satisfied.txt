Complete in your presence 
 Secure in your love 
 You make me who I am 
 Because of who you are 
 Wanting for nothing 
 Lost in your eyes 
 Contented just to be 
 Forever by your side 
 I'm satisfied; mesmerized 
 That's how it is when I'm with you 
 Satisfied; completely mesmerized 
 That's how it is when I'm with you 
 Complete in your presence 
 Secure in your love 
 You make me who I am 
 Because of who you are 
 And wanting for nothing 
 Lost in your eyes 
 Contented just to be 
 Forever by your side 
 I'm satisfied; mesmerized 
 That's how it is when I'm with you, oh 
 I'm satisfied; completely mesmerized 
 That's how it is when I'm with you 
 How could I ever ask for more 
 Than what you give me, Lord? 
 I find it all in you 
 Yes, I find it all in you 
 I am satisfied; mesmerized 
 That's how it is when I'm with you 
 I am satisfied; completely mesmerized 
 That's how it is 
 Oh, that's how it always is 
 That's how it is when I'm with you

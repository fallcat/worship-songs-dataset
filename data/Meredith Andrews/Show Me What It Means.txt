You don't want my perfection 
 All You ask of me 
 Is that I show up broken at Your feet 
 You don't want my religion 
 You are looking for devotion 
 That is more than just routine 
 So show me what it means 
 To take up my cross 
 And count it all as loss 
 All for the sake 
 Of knowing You 
 To love my enemies 
 And care for those in need 
 Show me what it means 
 To follow You 
 Have I become like the Pharisee 
 Passing by the needy 
 While I'm speaking Jesus on my lips? 
 Will I walk with You on raging seas 
 Or will I turn away 
 When You want more than what I want to give? 
 So show me what it means 
 What it means 
 To take up my cross 
 And count it all as loss 
 All for the sake 
 Of knowing You 
 To love my enemies 
 And care for those in need 
 Show me what it means 
 To follow You 
 To love as You love 
 And live as You lived 
 To never give up 
 On giving You my life 
 To love as You love 
 And live as You lived 
 To find out what it means 
 To be alive 
 To be alive 
 To take up my cross 
 And count it all as loss 
 All for the sake 
 Of knowing You 
 To love my enemies 
 And care for those in need 
 Show me what it means 
 To follow You 
 To take up my cross 
 And count it all as loss 
 All for the sake 
 Of knowing You 
 To love my enemies 
 And care for those in need 
 Show me what it means 
 To follow You

Here I remind myself what You said over me 
 Here I remind my soul who You are 
 You said You won’t relent 
 Won’t let go, won’t forget 
 Every promise You have whispered to my heart 
 As I wait, as I wait on You 
 I’m gonna run and not grow weary 
 I’m gonna walk and not grow faint 
 Rise up on wings like eagles 
 To soar 
 I know with everything you’re with me 
 I know you’re working as I wait 
 Lift me up on wings like eagles 
 To soar 
 This desert holds a song I will sing, on and on 
 You’re a river when the ground I walk is dry 
 You will set the crooked straight 
 Clear my path, make a way 
 You will lead me from the valley to the heights 
 Oh, as I wait, as I wait on You 
 I’m gonna run and not grow weary 
 I’m gonna walk and not grow faint 
 Rise up on wings like eagles 
 To soar 
 I know with everything you’re with me 
 I know you’re working as I wait 
 Lift me up on wings like eagles 
 To soar 
 Creator, Keeper 
 Lifebreather 
 Your name is greater than anything I’ve faced 
 Sustainer, Saviour, 
 Strongholdbreaker 
 Your name is greater than anything I’ve faced 
 As I wait, as I wait on You 
 I will wait, God, I will wait on You 
 I’m gonna run and not grow weary 
 I’m gonna walk and not grow faint 
 I’ll rise up on wings like eagles 
 To soar 
 I know with everything you’re with me 
 I know you’re working as I wait 
 Lift me up on wings like eagles 
 To soar

You are air to desperate lungs 
 Water falling on the sand 
 Silence to an angry storm 
 Sight to a blind man 
 You're still the God, a miracle 
 So if You're gonna move again 
 Then would You move in me? 
 (Move in me) 
 Move in me 
 You're the beat to a broken heart 
 Bread for a hungry crowd 
 And one word from Your voice rings out 
 And the dead throw the grave clothes down 
 'Cause You're still the God of the empty tomb 
 The one who came alive again 
 So come alive in me 
 (Come alive in me) 
 Come alive in me 
 Come alive in me 
 Come alive in me 
 My life is an empty cup 
 Fill it up, fill it up! 
 I wanna hear every rescued heart cry 
 "You're enough, You're enough!" 
 Break what needs breaking 
 'Til You're all we see 
 And start with me 
 (Start with me) 
 Start with me 
 Whose arms hold the fatherless? 
 Whose voice do they hear? 
 Who sits with the prisoner 
 And stands for the one in fear? 
 You're still the God of what is just 
 And You're still the God who loves 
 So would You love through me 
 (Love through me) 
 Love through me, yeah 
 Come and love through me 
 Would You love through me? Yeah 
 My life is an empty cup 
 Fill it up, fill it up! 
 I wanna hear every rescued heart cry 
 "You're enough, You're enough!" 
 Break what needs breaking 
 'Til You're all we see 
 And start with me 
 (Start with me) 
 Start with me, yeah 
 Your kingdom come 
 Your will be done 
 Lord, let it be 
 Let it start with me, start with me 
 Yes, Your kingdom come 
 And Your will be done 
 Oh Lord, let it be 
 Let it start with me, start with me 
 Yeah, start with me 
 Start with me 
 My life is an empty cup 
 Fill it up, fill it up! 
 I wanna hear every rescued heart cry 
 "You're enough, You're enough!" 
 Break what needs breaking 
 'Til You're all we see 
 And start with me 
 Start with me 
 Yeah, start with me 
 Start with me 
 Yeah

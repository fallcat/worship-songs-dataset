Father to the fatherless Defender of the weak 
 Freedom for the prisoner we sing 
 This is God in His holy place 
 This is God clothed in love and strength 
 Sing out lift your voice and cry out 
 Awesome is our strong God mighty is our God 
 You're with us in the wilderness faithful to provide 
 Ev'ry breath and ev'ry step we see 
 Sing out lift your voice and cry out 
 Awesome is our strong God mighty is our God 
 Sing out raise your hands and shout out 
 Awesome is our strong God mighty is our God 
 There is no higher no 
 There is no greater no 
 There is none stronger than our God 
 There is no higher no 
 There is no greater no 
 There is none stronger than our God 
 There is no higher no 
 There is no greater no 
 There is none stronger than our God

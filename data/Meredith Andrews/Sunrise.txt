I can see the dawn of a new day 
 I can see a new horizon 
 I remember all you've told me 
 I can feel my faith arising 
 I have set my heart on who I know you are 
 Yeah, I have set my sights on you 
 I'm coming out of the midnight hour 
 I'm coming out of the shadows 
 I know, every time I choose to lift my eyes 
 I see sunrise 
 I have walked the lowest valleys 
 I have stood before the lions 
 You were with me in the trenches 
 You are greater than the giant 
 I have set my heart on who I know you are 
 Yeah, I have set my sights on you 
 Do what you want to do 
 I'm coming out of the midnight hour 
 I'm coming out of the shadows 
 I know, every time I choose to lift my eyes 
 I see sunrise 
 I'm coming into the promised hope now 
 With the faith that I won't let go 
 Everytime I choose to lift my eyes 
 I see sunrise 
 Joy is coming with the morning 
 Joy is coming, I can feel it rising in me 
 Joy is coming with the morning 
 Joy is coming, I can feel it rising in me 
 I'm coming out of the midnight hour 
 I'm coming out of the shadows 
 I know, every time I choose to lift my eyes 
 I see sunrise 
 I'm coming into the promised hope now 
 With the faith that I won't let go 
 Everytime I choose to lift my eyes 
 I see sunrise 
 Joy is coming with the morning 
 Joy is coming, I can feel it rising in me 
 Joy is coming with the morning 
 Joy is coming, I can feel it rising in me

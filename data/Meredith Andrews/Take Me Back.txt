Take me back to the day I met you 
 When my dead heart came alive 
 I was running, but you came chasing 
 You couldn't wait to take me back 
 I'll sing of a grace that's still amazing 
 I'll dance like a child before the king 
 And I'll shout like I've heard it for the first time 
 You have come to save the lost and last 
 And you are the God who always takes me back 
 Take me back to the day I saw you 
 Through the eyes of my first child 
 You let my heart see how much you love me 
 The Father's arms will always take me back 
 I'll sing of a grace that's still amazing 
 I'll dance like a child before the king 
 I'll shout like I've heard it for the first time 
 You have come to save the lost and last 
 And you are the God who always takes me back 
 Take me home to a place I'll know soon 
 Where sin and sorrow cannot go 
 And all your family, forever standing 
 In the glory of the God who takes us back 
 I'll sing of the grace that's still amazing 
 I'll dance like a child before the king 
 And I'll shout like I've heard it for the first time 
 You have come to save the lost and last 
 So I will sing of the grace that's still amazing 
 I'll dance like a child before my king 
 And I'll shout like I've heard it for the first time 
 You have come to save the lost and last 
 And you are the God who always takes me back

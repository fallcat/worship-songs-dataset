The gospel changes everything 
 The turning point in history 
 Even now it's changing me 
 From who I was 
 The story of my Savior calls 
 Me to the wonder of the cross 
 The gospel changes everything 
 And it is changing me 
 The gospel changes everything 
 The turning point in history 
 And even now it's changing me 
 From who I was 
 The story of my Savior calls 
 Me to the wonder of the cross 
 The gospel changes everything 
 And it is changing me 
 You saved my soul 
 By Your blood 
 And I'm undone 
 By Your great love 
 You made a way 
 So I could come 
 Just as I am 
 To You my God 
 Jesus changes everything 
 There is no greater mystery 
 That God would come to rescue me 
 From who I was 
 The kindness of my Savior calls 
 Me to the wonder of His love 
 Jesus changes everything 
 And He is changing me 
 You saved my soul 
 By Your blood 
 And I'm undone 
 By Your great love 
 You made a way 
 So I could come 
 Just as I am 
 To You my God 
 You made a way 
 So I could come 
 Just as I am 
 To You my God 
 To You my God 
 Just as I am 
 To You my God

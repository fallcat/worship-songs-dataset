You are the God who reconciles 
 The wayward heart through Christ 
 The old has gone, the new has come 
 We are reconciled by love 
 We are reconciled by love 
 You are the God who reconciles 
 The wayward heart through Christ 
 The old has gone, the new has come 
 We are reconciled by love 
 We are reconciled by love 
 And this is the new song we sing 
 To the King of Heaven 
 This is the new song we bring 
 After all You've given 
 And we stand before You redeemed 
 As Your children 
 This is the new song we sing 
 We, who were once so far away 
 Are brought near by Your blood 
 The barrier has been destroyed 
 By Your grace we freely come 
 By Your grace we freely come 
 And this is the new song we sing 
 To the King of Heaven 
 This is the new song we bring 
 After all You've given 
 And we stand before You redeemed 
 As Your children 
 This is the new song we sing 
 And we live in You, we live for You 
 We live to You, our King 
 We stand in You, we stand for You 
 We stand as Your redeemed 
 We live in You, we live for You 
 We live to You, our King 
 Yeah, we stand in You, we stand for You 
 We stand as Your redeemed, Your redeemed 
 And this is the new song we sing 
 To the King of Heaven 
 This is the new song we bring 
 After all You've given 
 And we stand before You redeemed 
 As Your children 
 This is the new song we sing 
 And this is the new song we sing 
 To the King of Heaven 
 This is the new song we bring 
 After all You've given 
 And we stand before You redeemed 
 As Your children 
 This is the new song we sing

Everyone is broken and in need of a savior 
 So He came and was broken for the marker 
 For the shamed 
 Still our eyes are blinded by the culture 
 By the lies 
 We can't see that we're filthy, we're fallen 
 And so dry 
 But He invites us 
 Can you hear Him say? 
 He invites us 
 Hear Him call your name 
 Welcome to the river 
 Come drink, come away, come find your very life 
 Welcome to the river of God 
 Where your brokeness is washed away 
 Everywhere is the sorrow 
 And the pain of empty living 
 You can see it: look in their eyes 
 All the hopelessness of the world 
 But look closer; He is right there 
 In the midst of every fear 
 Living water is the offer 
 Restoration is the call 
 And He invites us 
 Can you hear Him say 
 He invites us 
 Hear Him call your name 
 Welcome to the river 
 Come drink, come away, come find your very life 
 Welcome to the river of God 
 Where your brokeness is washed away 
 Welcome to the river 
 Come drink, come away, come find your very life 
 Welcome to the river of God 
 Where your brokeness is washed away 
 Find your healing 
 Find your freedom 
 In the river of God 
 Find your healing 
 Find your freedom 
 In the river of God 
 Your healing here 
 Your freedom here 
 In the river of God 
 Your healing here 
 Your freedom here 
 In the river of God 
 Welcome to the river 
 Come drink, come away, come find your very life 
 Welcome to the river of God 
 Where your brokeness is washed away 
 Washed away 
 Everyone is broken and in need of a savior

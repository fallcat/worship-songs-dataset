It's not what you do for me 
 It's not what you give to me 
 It's not about anything but you my king 
 'Cause you are more beautiful 
 Then anything in this world 
 Even more wonderful then any gift you bring 
 My trasure is you, there's no other 
 My treasure is you, more then gold 
 Heaven and earth, they have lost their lustre 
 You alone are the treasure that I hold 
 Nothing can take away; nothing can separate 
 Nothing can come between your heart and mine 
 'Cause you are my everything, the hope of eternity 
 And you will forever be the love of my life 
 My trasure is you, there's no other 
 My treasure is you, more then gold 
 Heaven and earth they have lost their lustre 
 You alone are the treasure that I hold 
 Your love is hidden in my heart 
 And my heart is hidden in your love 
 Your love is hidden in my heart 
 And my heart is hidden in your love 
 My treasure is you, there's no other 
 My treasure is you, more then gold 
 Heaven and earth, they have lost their lustre 
 You alone are the treasure that I hold 
 You alone the treasure

How could I forget Your face 
 When all it took was just one day 
 For me to see it wasn't ordinary 
 I could never be the same 
 You took my hand and led the way 
 I didn't even know Your name 
 But something happened deep inside me 
 And I knew life would have to change 
 So how could I go back to life as usual 
 And how could I return to who I once was 
 I just want to take your story to the world 
 'Cause you have shown me what it means to love 
 You healed the sick, You calmed the sea 
 But Your heart was for the least of these 
 You came to love the lost and broken 
 Your cross has set the captive free 
 Now I no longer live for myself 
 Your words are so clear 
 Help me live it loud enough so they can hear

The thought of You is baffling 
 My mind can't wrap around You 
 This human cup cannot contain 
 Heaven's glory flood 
 Who is like You, Lord 
 Who was and is to come? 
 Forever worshiped and adored 
 We pour our hearts out here before Your throne 
 This is for You alone, yeah 
 The sight of You leaves me speechless 
 One glimpse and I am undone 
 This weight of glory stirs my soul 
 And I fall face down 
 Who is like You, Lord? 
 Who was and is to come? 
 Forever worshiped and adored 
 We pour our hearts out here before Your throne 
 This is for You 
 All I can say is 'holy' 
 All I can do is fall on my face and cry 'Holy!' 
 You are holy 
 Who is like You, Lord 
 Who was and is to come? 
 Forever worshiped and adored 
 We pour our hearts out here before Your throne 
 This is for You alone 
 Who is like You?

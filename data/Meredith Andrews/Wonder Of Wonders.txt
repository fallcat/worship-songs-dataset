The painted sky, the sparkling sea 
 They whisper who You are 
 The distant glow of galaxies 
 Radiate Your heart 
 There's a song among the stars 
 You are the Lord of lords 
 The wonder of wonders 
 God of the ages, all of creation 
 It beats with Your heart 
 You are the Lord of lords 
 The wonder of wonders 
 God never changing, now and for always 
 You are, You are the Lord 
 You are the Lord 
 The whole world carried in Your hand 
 Stretched out upon the cross 
 And by Your wounds, our life begins 
 There's healing in Your scars 
 There is freedom where You are 
 You are the Lord of lords 
 The wonder of wonders 
 God of the ages, all of creation 
 It beats with Your heart 
 You are the Lord of lords 
 The wonder of wonders 
 God never changing, now and for always 
 You are, You are 
 The wonder of wonders 
 There is no other 
 God never changing, now and for always 
 You are, You are 
 You spoke in the darkness Your name, Your name 
 You spoke and it broke all our chains, our chains 
 Now Jesus sweet Lord, we claim, we claim 
 Now Jesus sweet Lord, we claim, we claim 
 Now Jesus sweet Lord, we claim, we claim 
 You are the Lord of lords 
 The wonder of wonders 
 God of the ages, all of creation 
 It beats with Your heart 
 You are the Lord of lords 
 The wonder of wonders 
 God never changing, now and for always 
 You are, You are 
 The wonder of wonders 
 There is no other (no) 
 God never changing, now and for always 
 You are, You are the Lord 
 You are the Lord

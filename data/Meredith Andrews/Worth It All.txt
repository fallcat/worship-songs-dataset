All I am Lord here before You 
 Reaching out for more 
 You're the promise never failing 
 You are my reward, 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 I let go of all I have just to have all of You 
 And no matter what the cost I will follow You 
 Jesus everything I've lost I have found in You 
 When I finally reach the end I'll say 
 You are worth it all 
 There's no riches or earthly treasure 
 That will satisfy 
 Every longing is for You Jesus 
 Set this heart on fire 
 Oh, set this heart on fire 
 I let go of all I have just to have all of You 
 And no matter what the cost I will follow You 
 Jesus everything I've lost I have found in You 
 When I finally reach the end I'll say 
 You are worth it all 
 You are worth it all 
 When I'm there in Your glorious presence 
 Every knee is bowed before You 
 Hear the sound of heaven singing 
 You are worth it all 
 All the saints cry holy holy 
 Angels singing worthy worthy 
 Forever I will shout Your praises 
 You are worth it all

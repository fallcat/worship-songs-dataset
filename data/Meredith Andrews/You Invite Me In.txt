I've been searching 
 Wandering and hurting 
 Ashamed of the shape I'm in 
 Afraid You'll see who I really am 
 But You invite me in 
 Doesn't matter where I've been 
 Your arms are open wide 
 There's nothing left to hide 
 How can this be? 
 A love so unfailing 
 Reached down and lifted me 
 From ashes to beauty 
 And You invite me in 
 Doesn't matter where I've been 
 Your arms are open wide 
 There's nothing left to hide 
 For You invite me in 
 Doesn't matter who I've been 
 Your arms are open wide 
 Pulling me to Your side 
 And now I'm walking away 
 From the life I once knew 
 And running into Your grace 
 That covers my shame 
 Again and again, I find my life in You 
 You invite us in 
 Doesn't matter where we've been 
 Your arms are open wide 
 There's nothing left to hide 
 You invite us in 
 Doesn't matter who we've been 
 Your arms are open wide 
 Pulling us to Your side 
 Your arms are open wide

I searched for love 
 When the night came and it closed in 
 I was alone, but you found me where I was hiding 
 And now I'll never ever be the same 
 It was the sweetest voice that called my name 
 Saying 
 You're not alone for I am here 
 Let Me wipe away your every fear 
 My love, I've never left your side 
 I have seen you through your darkest night 
 And I'm the one who's loved you all your life 
 All your life 
 You cry yourself to sleep 
 'Cause the hurt is real, and the pain cuts deep 
 All hope seems lost 
 With heartache your closest friend 
 And everyone else long gone 
 You've had to face the music on your own 
 But there is a sweeter song, that calls you home 
 Saying 
 You're not alone for I am here 
 Let Me wipe away your every tear 
 My love, I've never left your side 
 I have seen you through your darkest night 
 And I'm the one who's loved you all you life 
 All your life 
 Faithful and true, forever! 
 Oh, My love will carry you! 
 You're not alone 
 for I am here 
 Let Me wipe away your every fear 
 Oh yeah 
 My love, I've never left your side 
 I have seen you through your darkest night 
 Your darkest night 
 And I'm the one who's loved you all you life 
 All your life

Oh oh, this is our war cry 
 Oh oh, this is our battle cry 
 (Repeat) 
 Sounds like thunder 
 The earth is shaking 
 A generation is marching strong 
 We will not be stopped 
 Our voices will be heard 
 Let the nations hear our song 
 Oh oh, this is our war cry 
 Oh oh, this is our battle cry 
 (Repeat) 
 Feel the tremble 
 Heaven's raging 
 Hear the sound of a holy roar 
 He will not be stopped 
 His voice will be heard 
 This generation is the Lord's

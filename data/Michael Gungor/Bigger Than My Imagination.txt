Bigger than my imagination 
 Great are You Lord 
 Your glory and power 
 Make the greatest kings pale 
 The biggest things small 
 The heart in me sail 
 Great are You Lord 
 Your glory and power 
 Make the nations bow down 
 The mountains tremble 
 The heavens sing out 
 Great are You Lord 
 You're bigger than my imagination 
 You're larger than a world of dreams 
 You're greater then the sum of all love Lord 
 You're everything to me, everything to me

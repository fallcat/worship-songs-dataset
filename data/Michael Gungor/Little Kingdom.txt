What do I have to offer 
 What do I have to give 
 A mind a body some things You gave me 
 It's not all that much 
 But it's all I've got 
 Let Your Kingdom come 
 Let Your Kingdom come 
 To my world 
 This little kingdom 
 Come and reign 
 Come and reign 
 Come and reign 
 Come and reign 
 All that I have I offer 
 All that I am I give 
 My mind my body the things You gave me 
 It's not all that much 
 But it's all I've got 
 Father Who art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be Thy name 
 Let Your Kingdom come 
 Let Thy will be done 
 Let Your Kingdom come 
 Let Your will be done 
 For Thine is the Kingdom 
 And Thine is the power 
 Thine is the glory forever 
 For Thine is the Kingdom 
 And Thine is the power 
 This is the glory forever and ever 
 Amen

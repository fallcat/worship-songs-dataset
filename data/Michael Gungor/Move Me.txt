And You move me 
 Just when I thought that I had it all together 
 And You move me 
 Just when I thought things could not get any better 
 I am ready come and move me once again 
 I am ready come and move me once again 
 And You move me 
 Closer to You closer to Your heart 
 I see clearer so much clearer than before 
 And You move me 
 Lord You move me 
 And You move me 
 From the comfort that I've come to know and love 
 And You move me 
 To experience to sovereignty of God 
 Come and move me once again 
 Come and move me once again

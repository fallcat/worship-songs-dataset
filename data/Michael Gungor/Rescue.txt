You are the source of life 
 I can't be left behind 
 No one else will do 
 I will take hold of You 
 I need You, Jesus 
 To come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 My heart is Your's for life 
 I need Your hand in mine 
 No one else will do 
 I put my trust in You 
 I need You, Jesus 
 To come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 I need You, Jesus 
 To come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow You 
 This world has nothing for me 
 This world has nothing for me 
 This world has nothing for me 
 I need You, Jesus 
 To come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 I need You, Jesus 
 To come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name by which I am saved 
 Capture me with grace 
 Capture me with grace 
 Capture me with grace 
 I will follow You

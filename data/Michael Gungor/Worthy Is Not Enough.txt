All that You are 
 Overwhelms me 
 And my words aren't enough 
 I cry holy 
 Worthy worthy 
 But my heart longs to say more 
 So much more 
 So hear my heart 
 Loud and clear 
 'Cause worthy's not enough for You to hear 
 Hear my heart 
 As I sing 
 As I respond with worship to my King 
 Give me the words I want to say 
 Unearth the songs I want to sing 
 Hear my heart 
 Hear my heart

Summer rains keep coming down 
 It's about to swallow up this town 
 You get the feeling that there's trouble ahead 
 Folks say they've never seen 
 The river acting quite this mean 
 No one can stop it when it needs to be fed 
 Look at the river 
 The powerful river 
 Greater Than We Understand 
 Awesome in anger 
 Crazy with hunger 
 Dragging us under 
 But you have the power 
 The power to heal us 
 Greater than we understand 
 Righteous in anger 
 Awesome with wonder 
 If we reach out for your hand 
 Yeah 
 To many years since the lava flow 
 This old mountain's about to blow 
 Covering anything that gets in its way 
 Not a lot that you can say or do 
 When the mountain wants to roll over you 
 But gather up the ones you love and start to pray 
 Look at the mountain 
 The powerful mountain 
 Greater than we understand 
 Awesome in anger 
 Crazy with hunger 
 Dragging us under 
 Yeah x3 
 But you have the power 
 The power to heal us 
 Greater than we understand 
 Righteous in anger 
 Awesome with wonder 
 Greater than we understand 
 Yeah 
 As far as you or I can see 
 Hard times there will always be 
 Thank God for answers to the trouble ahead

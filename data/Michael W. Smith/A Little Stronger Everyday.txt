I was throwing away what I needed most 
 It was the father, son, and the holy ghost 
 A little carnal knowledge is a dangerous thing 
 It'll eat a hole in the brain 
 I'd be the biggest fool in the whole universe 
 To trade a heavenly blessing for a worldly curse 
 I was a weaker man till I made my stand 
 Now I am here to make a change 
 I'm running blind on the wheels of faith 
 Moving to the beat of a heart that prays 
 Hanging on every word you said 
 I get a little stronger every day 
 Ain't gonna find any help on the TV 
 Or written down on the pages of People magazine 
 It takes digging a little deeper into the good book now 
 For a little sacred advice 
 I'm running blind on the wheels of faith 
 Moving to the beat of a heart that prays 
 Hanging on every word you said 
 I get a little stronger every day 
 Getting strong, stronger now, every day 
 Getting strong, stronger now, every day 
 I'm getting stronger 
 I'm running blind on the wheels of faith 
 Moving to the beat of a heart that prays 
 Hanging on every word you said 
 I get a little stronger every day

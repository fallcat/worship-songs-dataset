A million lights 
 Hanging on the world tonight 
 I see them reaching down 
 Dancing on the evening tide 
 For You 
 All the stars are singing 
 With You 
 Every day I'm feeling 
 Alive 
 A million days 
 In everyone, I've seen Your face 
 I know I'll never be alone 
 Even darkness comes awake 
 For You 
 All the stars are singing 
 With You 
 Every day I'm feeling 
 Alive 
 Ooh, oh-ooh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh 
 Ooh, oh-ooh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh 
 Ooh, oh-ooh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh 
 Ooh, oh-ooh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh 
 For You 
 All the stars are singing 
 And You 
 I can feel You reaching 
 For You 
 All the stars are singing 
 With You 
 Every day I'm feeling 
 Alive 
 Ooh, oh-ooh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh 
 All the stars are singing 
 All the stars are singing 
 Ooh, oh-ooh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh 
 Every day I'm feeling 
 Alive 
 Ooh, oh-ooh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh 
 All the stars are singing (a million lights) 
 All the stars are singing (a million lights) 
 All the stars are singing, singing, singing, singing (a million lights) 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh

Can you hear, there's a new song 
 Breaking out from the children of freedom 
 Every race and every nation 
 Sing it out sing a new Hallelujah 
 Let us sing love to the nations 
 Bringing hope of the grace that has freed us 
 Make Him known and make Him famous 
 Sing it out sing to the new Hallelujah 
 Arise 
 Let the church Arise 
 Let love reach to the other side 
 Alive come alive 
 Let the song Arise 
 Africa sings a new song 
 Reaching out with the new Hallelujah 
 Every son and every daughter 
 Everyone sing a new Hallelujah 
 Arise 
 Let the song Arise 
 Let love reach to the other side 
 Alive come alive 
 Let the song Arise 
 Whoa whoa yeah (2x) 
 Let the song arise (2x) 
 Let the song arise yeah (2x) 
 spoken: 
 Let the world sing a new Hallelujah 
 From Africa to Australia 
 From Brazil to China 
 From New York down to Houston! 
 Arise 
 Let the church Arise 
 Let love reach to the other side 
 Alive come alive 
 Let the song Arise 
 Everyone sing a new Hallelujah (2x)

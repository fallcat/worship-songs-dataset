Caught in a dream of where I want 
 To be 
 Wrapped in a web of where I am 
 I feel a wall between what is and 
 What should be 
 You find find me waiting for a miracle 
 You hear me praying for a plan 
 You are the only one prepared to 
 Rescue me 
 Then you take away the distance 
 Found between the truth and me 
 And you give a simple reason to my 
 Restless rhyme 
 Woa, hide me in the heaven 
 You have held within your hand 
 And make a way to find a way to 
 Soothe my mind 
 There is a way that might seem 
 Right to me 
 A dim reflection of what's good 
 Just an illusion of the best that I 
 Can be 
 But there's another path You offer 
 Me 
 I wish I was always understood 
 Some way You see right through my 
 Thoughts 
 And know my needs 
 Please come soothe my soul 
 You always take away the distance 
 Found between the truth and me 
 And you give a simple reason to my 
 Restless rhyme 
 And you hide me in the heaven 
 You have held within your hand 
 You always make a way to find a way to 
 Soothe my mind

Worship album version, which is the same as the version on WOW Hits 2003: 
 (Studio Version): 
 Above all powers, above all kings 
 Above all nature and all created things 
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man 
 You were here before the world began 
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones, 
 Above all wonders the world has ever known 
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth 
 There’s no way to measure what You’re worth 
 Crucified, laid behind a stone 
 You lived to die, rejected and alone 
 Like a rose, trampled on the ground 
 You took the fall and thought of me 
 Above all 
 Above all powers, above all kings 
 Above all nature and all created things 
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man 
 You were here, before the world began 
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones 
 Above all wonders the world has ever known 
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth 
 There’s no way to measure what You’re worth. 
 Crucified, laid behind a stone 
 You lived to die, rejected and alone 
 Like a rose, trampled on the ground 
 You took the fall and thought of me 
 Above all 
 Crucified, laid behind a stone 
 You lived to die, rejected and alone 
 Like a rose, trampled on the ground 
 You took the fall and thought of me 
 Above all 
 Like a rose, trampled on the ground 
 You took the fall and thought of me. 
 Above all

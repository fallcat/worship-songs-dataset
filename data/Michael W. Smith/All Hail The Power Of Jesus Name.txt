All hail the power of Jesus name let angels prostrate fall 
 Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all 
 Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all 
 Ye chosen seed of Israel's race, Ye ransomed from the fall 
 Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all 
 Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all 
 Raise up the crown, rise on the praises 
 Rest on the brow of the King of the ages 
 O that with yonder sacred throng we at His feet may fall 
 We'll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all 
 We'll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all 
 Crown Him Lord of all 
 Crown Him Lord of all

Sad goodbye 
 Never quite got said 
 Now the time is gone 
 We're moving on 
 Even though it hurts so bad 
 If I could 
 I'd turn back the days 
 And I'd love again 
 To be your friend 
 In a hundred different ways 
 But we can't turn back the time 
 The days 
 So if I never said, all I needed to say 
 I'll say it now 
 You know I loved you once 
 I love you stronger than day 
 Please love, find me a way 
 Words, I still need to say 
 But I don't know how 
 Can't stand still 
 Still I can't move on 
 Lord, I need your strength 
 Need you and me 
 'Cause a part of me is gone 
 In time, I will know 
 What I've yet to see 
 That through all the pain 
 You hurt the same 
 And you're standing here with me 
 More than anything it's you 
 I need 
 So if I never said, all I needed to say 
 I'll say it now 
 You know I loved you once 
 I love you stronger than day 
 Please love find me a way 
 Words, I still need to say 
 Please show me how 
 So if I never said, all I needed to say 
 I'll say it now 
 You know I loved you once 
 I love you stronger than day 
 Please love find me a way 
 Words, I still need to say 
 But I don't know how 
 Please love find me a way 
 Please show me how

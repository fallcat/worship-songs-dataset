All I have in this world 
 Is fire from above 
 All I have in this world 
 Is you 
 And all the journeys I have walked 
 I know you've walked them too 
 All I want is to be faithful 
 All I want is you 
 All I have is a love 
 That set my world on fire 
 Let it fall, let it burn in me 
 And oh to be a friend of God is all that I desire 
 All I want is to be faithful 
 All I want is you 
 All I want is you 
 All I want is you 
 All I want is you 
 Is you 
 All I have in this world 
 Is fire from above 
 All I have in this world 
 Is you 
 And all the journeys I have walked 
 I know you've walked them too 
 All I want is to be faithful 
 All I want is you 
 All I want is you 
 All I want is you 
 Da... oh oh oh 
 All I want is you 
 Is you

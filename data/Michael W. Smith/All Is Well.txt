 Angels and men rejoice 
 For tonight darkness fell 
 Into the dawn of love's light 
 Sing A-le 
 Sing Alleluia 
 All is well all is well Let there be peace on earth 
 Christ is come go and tell 
 That He is in the manger 
 Sing A-le

 All is well all is well 
 Lift up your voice and sing 
 Born is now Emmanuel 
 Born is our Lord and Savior 
 Sing Alleluia 
 Sing Alleluia 
 All is well

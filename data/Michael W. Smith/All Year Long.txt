This Christmas season I wish you joy 
 The wonder in every girl and boy 
 I wish you gladness, the one [Incomprehensible] 
 Have good friends and family gathered near 
 May children's laughter in falling snow 
 Rekindle those sweet scenes from long ago 
 May every carol, each candle bright 
 Remind you why angels sang that night 
 If trouble finds you, this is my prayer 
 May peace come into your hearts and make you strong 
 And I wish you luck, the kind to last all year long

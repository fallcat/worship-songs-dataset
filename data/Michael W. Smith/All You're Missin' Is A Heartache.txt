(Michael W. Smith) 
 It's over the line - a shadow of doubt 
 From outside looking at the "In Crowd" 
 (Tempting voices are calling you) 
 They look mighty fine - a sight to behold 
 But all that glitters is not gold 
 (Still those voices are calling you) 
 All you're missin' is a heartache 
 A disillusion for a keepsake 
 A life of living with your own mistake 
 All You're missin' is a heartache 
 The water is high - you're out on a limb 
 Well, if you take the fall then it's "sink or swim" 
 (Clouds of reason will follow you) 
 You're kissing the dark 
 You're courting your pride 
 You wonder is it greener on the other side 
 (But they have nothing to offer you)

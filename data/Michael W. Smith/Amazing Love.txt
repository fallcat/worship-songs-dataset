My steps were wandering 
 My lips were hungry 
 My heart was thundering 
 For something more than all those things 
 My words were crying out 
 My faith was darkened out 
 My life lost without 
 This one amazing love 
 Washing over me like rain 
 Conquering the fear and pain 
 My broken path was not in vain 
 Glory Hallelujah, glory Hallelujah 
 Glory Hallelujah, glory Hallelujah 
 Washing over me like rain 
 Taking all the fear and pain 
 My broken path was not in vain 
 Glory Hallelujah, glory Hallelujah 
 I lift my blinded eyes 
 Towards the souls denied 
 And saw the One who died 
 For one amazing love 
 Hallelujah 
 One amazing love 
 Just one amazing love 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Just one amazing love 
 Just one amazing love

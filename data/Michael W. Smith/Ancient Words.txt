Holy words long preserved 
 For our walk in this world, 
 They resound with God's own heart 
 Oh, let the Ancient words impart. 
 Words of Life, words of Hope 
 Give us strength, help us cope 
 In this world, where e'er we roam 
 Ancient words will guide us Home. 
 Ancient words ever true 
 Changing me, and changing you. 
 We have come with open hearts 
 Oh let the ancient words impart. 
 Holy words of our Faith 
 Handed down to this age. 
 Came to us through sacrifice 
 Oh heed the faithful words of Christ. 
 Holy words long preserved 
 For our walk in this world. 
 They resound with God's own heart 
 Oh let the ancient words impart. 
 We have come with open hearts 
 Oh let the ancient words impart.

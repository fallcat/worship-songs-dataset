Maybe there's a light in my soul 
 Maybe it flickers like a neon sign 
 Outside an abandoned hotel 
 Maybe there are things you just can't know 
 But can you say there are no mysteries 
 In the house you choose to dwell 
 Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware 
 Maybe there's a place where we will fly 
 But some say God is dead like Nietzsche said 
 And faith has made me a fool 
 But maybe there is more than meets the eye 
 Who's that stranger there beside you? 
 Don't be smug and don't be cruel 
 Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware 
 Battles of the heart and mind 
 We stay caught in mental purgatory 
 'Til our existence can be defined 
 Meanwhile on the shores of parallel 
 There may be a holy conference held 
 Somewhere 
 Discussing all mankind 
 Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware 
 Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware 
 Angels unaware

Jack is in the corner 
 The dish is with the spoon 
 The sheep is in the meadow 
 The cow is on the moon 
 But I am here with you and I believe 
 There's no other place I'd rather be 
 And a promise not to leave you 
 Is a promise I can keep 
 You're my muse 
 You're my rhyme 
 You're the fire warming this heart of mine 
 When you hear me say "I love you" 
 Anna, do you know how much I do? 
 So I watch you from a distance 
 Getting lost within your world 
 You pretend to be a princess 
 As you flutter and you twirl 
 Fragile as the flower in your hair 
 Dancing in your castle, unaware 
 That a single day without you 
 Would be more than I could bear 
 Little Anna, little star 
 That is what you really are 
 Cross my heart and hope to die 
 You're the apple of my eye

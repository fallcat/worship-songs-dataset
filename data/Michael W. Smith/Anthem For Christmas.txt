Words: Gloria Gaither 
 Music: Michael W. Smith 
 In the space of the beginning 
 Was the living Word of Light 
 When this Word was clearly spoken 
 All that came to be was right 
 All creation had a language 
 Words to say what must be said 
 All day long the heavens whispered 
 Signing words in scarlet red 
 Some failed to understand it 
 So God spoke His final Word 
 On a silent night in Judah's 
 Hills a baby's cry was heard 
 "Glory!" sang the angel chorus 
 "Glory!" echoed back the night 
 Love has come to walk among us 
 Christ the Lord is born this night 
 All creation sing His praises 
 Earth and heaven praise His name 
 All who live come join the chorus 
 Find the words His love proclaim 
 Find the words His love proclaim

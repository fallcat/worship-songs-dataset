 Hallowed be thy name 
 Our Father, which art in Heaven

 Thy Will be done 
 On Earth as it is in Heaven 
 Our Father, which art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name

 Give us this day 
 Our daily bread 
 And forgive us our debts 
 As we forgive our debtors 
 Our Father, which art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name 
 Our Father, which art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name 
 And lead us not into temptation 
 But deliver us, deliver us from evil 
 For Thine is the Kingdom, and all the power 
 And the glory 
 Forever Amen 
 Our Father, which art in Heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name 
 Thy Kingdom come 
 Thy Will be done 
 On Earth as it is in Heaven

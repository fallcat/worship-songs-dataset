Away in a manger 
 No crib for a bed 
 The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head 
 The stars in the sky looking down where He lay 
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay 
 Child in the manger, Infant of Mary 
 Outcast and stranger, Lord of all 
 Child who inherits 
 All our transgressions 
 All our demerits on Him fall 
 Once the most holy 
 Child of salvation 
 Gentle and lowly 
 Now as our glorious Mighty Redeemer 
 See Him victorious 
 O'er each foe 
 Prophets fortold Him 
 Infant of wonder 
 Angels behold Him On His throne 
 Worthy our Savior 
 Of all our praises 
 Happy forever 
 Are His own

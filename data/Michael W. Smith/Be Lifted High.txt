Sin and its ways grow old 
 All of my heart turns to stone 
 And I'm left with no strength to arise 
 How you need to be lifted high 
 Sin and its ways lead to pain 
 Left here with hurt and with shame 
 So no longer will I leave your side 
 Jesus, You be lifted high 
 You be lifted high 
 You be lifted high 
 You be lifted high I'm my life, Oh God 
 And I fall to my knees 
 So it's you that they see not I 
 Jesus, You be lifted high 
 And even now that I'm inside your hands 
 Help me not to grow prideful again 
 Don't let me forsake sacrifice 
 Jesus, You be lifted high 
 And if I'm blessed with the riches of kings 
 How could I ever think that it was me 
 For you brought me from darkness to light 
 Jesus, You be lifted high

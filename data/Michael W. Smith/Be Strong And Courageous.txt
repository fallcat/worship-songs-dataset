My servant, now your time has come 
 You have a job to do 
 I have a people to be led 
 And a willing heart in you 
 So I give you strength and courage 
 And I'll hide you in my hand 
 For Joshua, you gotta live for your call 
 Take my people to their land 
 So be strong and courageous 
 So be strong and courageous 
 You know you gotta be strong and courageous 
 So be strong and courageous 
 Never should you fear my call 
 Just listen and obey 
 Discouragement need never fall 
 Stand on the words I say 
 You know I led your fathers here 
 And you know I'll lead you too 
 Inscribe my law into your soul 
 And nothing will touch you

Wasn't it long ago 
 Wasn't it in a New England coast 
 Wasn't it the standard- people praying to 
 The Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost 
 One nation over God 
 Is that what we've now become? 
 The founding fathers left a noble legacy 
 To their sons and daughters 
 Look at what we've done 
 Look at what we've done 
 Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown 
 As we learn to bite the hand 
 That tries to feed us 
 Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown 
 If we say that we are free 
 Who will believe us? 
 If we breakdown 
 See the powder on the glass 
 See the pillow on the street 
 See the charter of a modern love 
 With no obligations or promises to meet 
 Hear the fear of disease 
 Hear the baby never born 
 Hear a people crying out 
 "Somebody save us- Oh, please somebody save us, 
 From what we're headed for- From what 
 we're headed for..." 
 Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown 
 As we learn to bite the hand 
 That tries to feed us 
 Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown 
 If we say that we are free 
 Who will believe us? 
 If we breakdown 
 The Second Decade album version: 
 Spoken: 
 American is essentially a dream 
 It is a dream of a land where men of all races 
 Of all nationalities and of all creeds 
 Can live together as brothers 
 Wasn't it long ago 
 Wasn't it in a New England coast 
 And wasn't it the standard- 
 People praying to 
 The Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost, yes 
 That they are endowed by their Creator 
 - Spoken 
 One nation over God 
 With certain ineligible rights 
 - Spoken 
 Is that what we've now become? 
 And among these are life, liberty 
 - Spoken 
 The founding fathers left a noble legacy 
 And the pursuit of happiness 
 - Spoken 
 To their sons and daughters 
 Their sons and daughters 
 Look at what we've done 
 Look at what we've done 
 Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown 
 As we learn to bite the hand 
 That tries to feed us 
 Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown 
 If we say that we are free 
 Who will believe us? 
 If we breakdown 
 Breakdown

 Breakdown 
 Break 
 See the powder on the glass 
 See the pillow on the street 
 See the charter of a modern love 
 With no obligations or promises to meet 
 To meet 
 Hear the fear of disease 
 Hear the baby never born 
 And hear a people crying out 
 "Somebody save us- 
 Oh, please somebody save us, 
 From what we're headed for- 
 From what we're headed for..."

 Spoken: 
 For the American dream reminds us 
 That every man is the heir of the legacy of dream 
 That ever since the founding fathers of our nation 
 Dreamed this dream 
 American has been, to use the big words of the psychologists and the psychiatrists use, 
 Are schizophrenic personalities 
 Spoken: 
 I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, 
 And to the republic for which it stands, 
 One Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." 
 Spoken: 
 Yeah

 Spoken: 
 This is the way of starving the American dream 
 The honest people who fear 
 Breakdown! 
 Who exercise that citizenship right 
 Are being thrown into jail 
 This is a way of starving the dream 
 We are here because of the most liberty of crime 
 Throughout Mississippi 
 This is the way of starving the dream 
 Because if you don't

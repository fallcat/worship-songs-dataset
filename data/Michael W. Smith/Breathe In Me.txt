You breathe in me 
 And I'm alive 
 With the power of your holiness 
 You breathe in me 
 And you revive 
 Feelings in my soul 
 That I have laid to rest 
 So breathe in me 
 I need you now 
 I've never felt so dead within 
 So breathe in me 
 Maybe somehow 
 You can breathe new life 
 In me again 
 I used to be 
 So sensitive 
 To the light that leads 
 To where you are 
 Now I've acquired 
 These callouses 
 With the darkness of 
 A cold and jaded heart 
 So breathe in me 
 I need you now 
 I've never felt so dead within 
 So breathe in me 
 Maybe somehow 
 You can breathe new life 
 In me again

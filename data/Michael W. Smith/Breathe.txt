This is the air I breathe 
 This is the air I breathe 
 Your holy presence living in me 
 This is my daily bread 
 This is my daily bread 
 Your very word spoken to me 
 And I I'm desperate for you 
 And I I'm I'm lost without you 
 This is the air I breathe 
 This is the air I breathe 
 Your holy presence living in me 
 This is my daily bread 
 This is my daily bread 
 Your very word spoken to me 
 And I'm, I'm desperate for you 
 And I'm, I'm lost without you 
 And I'm desperate for you 
 And I'm, I'm lost without you. 
 I'm lost without you. 
 I'm lost without you. 
 I'm desperate for you. 
 (Cry out to live) 
 I'm desperate for you... 
 I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost without you... 
 I'm lost without you 
 I'm desperate for you 
 (How many of you are hungry for God?) 
 (I want more of Him. Who wants the flood gates to open up?)

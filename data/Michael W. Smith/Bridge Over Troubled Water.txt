When you're weary 
 Feeling small 
 When tears are in your eyes 
 I'll dry them all 
 I'm on your side oh when times get bad 
 And friends just can't be found 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will lay me down 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will lay me down 
 When you're down and out 
 When you're on the street 
 When evening falls so hard 
 I will comfort you ooh 
 I'll take your part oh when darkness comes 
 And pain is all around 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will lay me down 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will lay me down 
 Sail on silver girl 
 Sail on by 
 Your time has come to shine 
 All your dreams are on their way 
 See how they shine 
 Oh when you need a friend 
 I'm sailing right behind 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will ease your mind 
 Like a bridge over troubled water 
 I will ease your mind 
 Yeah yeah

What of the children who have never felt a love 
 Tender as the morning 
 Nursing the bruises 
 And the scars that never seem to go away 
 What of the babies who have never left the womb 
 Breathing in the lifeline 
 Angels in waiting-gone 
 Before they could be given wings to fly 
 Calling heaven 
 Seeking mercy 
 Tell me there's a place for these 
 What of the noble who are searching for the truth 
 With truest of intentions 
 And yet they're jaded by 
 Hypocrisies behind cathedral walls 
 What of the humble and the meek that knew despair 
 And never got their moment 
 But sacrificed a life of comfort 
 So that others knew no pain 
 Calling heaven 
 Seeking mercy 
 Tell me there's a place for these 
 What of the ones who call you Lord 
 But play the field 
 With faithless indecision 
 Forgive us father 
 For we truly do not know what we have done 
 Calling heaven 
 Seeking mercy 
 Tell me there's a place for these

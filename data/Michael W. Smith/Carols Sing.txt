Carols sing to the King 
 Jesus Christ our Savior 
 Born this day, angels say 
 In a lowly manger 
 He came down to the earth 
 Bringing us new birth 
 Carols sing to the King 
 Jesus Christ our Savior 
 Tidings bring! 
 Hail the King 
 Shepherds did adore Him 
 From afar, by the star 
 Wise men sought and found Him 
 Son of God Son of man 
 All in all I see 
 Carols raise His name praise 
 He shall reign eternally 
 Carols sing to the King 
 Jesus Christ our Savior

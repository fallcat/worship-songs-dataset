As I rise, strength of God 
 Go before, lift me up 
 As I wake, eyes of God 
 Look upon, be my sight 
 As I wait, heart of God 
 Satisfy and sustain 
 As I hear, voice of God 
 Lead me on, be my guide 
 Oh be my guide 
 Above and below me 
 Before and behind me 
 In every eye that sees me 
 Christ be all around me 
 Above and below me 
 Before and behind me 
 In every eye that sees me 
 Christ be all around me 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Christ be all around me 
 And as I go, hand of God 
 My defense, by my side 
 And as I rest, the breath of God 
 Fall upon, bring me peace 
 Oh bring me peace 
 Above and below me 
 Before and behind me 
 In every eye that sees me 
 Christ be all around me 
 Above and below me 
 Before and behind me 
 In every eye that sees me 
 Christ be all around me 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Christ be all around me 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Christ be all around me 
 Your life, Your death 
 Your blood was shed 
 For every moment 
 Every moment 
 Your life, Your death 
 Your blood was shed 
 For every moment 
 Every moment 
 Your life, Your death 
 Your blood was shed 
 For every moment 
 Every moment 
 Your life, Your death 
 Your blood was shed 
 For every moment 
 Every moment 
 Above and below me 
 Before and behind me 
 In every eye that sees me 
 Christ be all around me 
 Above and below me 
 Before and behind me 
 In every eye that sees me 
 Christ be all around me 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Christ be all around me 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Christ be all around me

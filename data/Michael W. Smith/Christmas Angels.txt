Christmas angels sing all around us 
 Spread good tidings over the earth 
 Telling of a child in a manger who is born 
 He is the King of kings 
 King of glory, hope for our nations 
 Sent to earth to save and redeem 
 Prince of peace, behold and adore 
 The Son of God has come to set us free 
 Celebrate and sing Hallelujah 
 Raise the banner, dance and rejoice 
 Celebrate the birth of Messiah 
 He's the King of King, the Lord of all 
 Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest 
 Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest 
 We sing, joy to the world, the Lord has come 
 Joy to the world, the Lord has come 
 Joy to the world, He is here forever and always 
 Christmas angels sing all around us 
 All creation hears what they say 
 Bow before Him, come and behold 
 The Son of God born on Christmas day 
 Joy to the world, the Lord has come

Frosted window panes 
 Candels gleaming inside 
 Painted candy canes on the tree 
 Santa's on his way 
 He's filled his sleigh with things 
 Things for you and for me 
 It's that time of year 
 When the world falls in love 
 Every song you hear seems to say 
 Merry Christmas 
 May your New Year's dreams come true 
 And this song of mine 
 In three quarter time 
 Wishes you and yours 
 The same thing too! 
 It's that time of year 
 When the world falls in love 
 Every song you hear seems to say 
 Merry Christmas 
 Frosted window panes 
 (See them gleaming) 
 Candels gleaming inside (with the snow) 
 Painted candy canes 
 (See them showing) 
 On the tree 
 Just look and you'll see 
 Santa's on his way 
 (That's why sliegh bells are ringing) 
 He's filled his sleigh 
 (And that's why were all singing) 
 With Things 
 Things for you and for me 
 It's that time of year 
 (Time for falling) 
 When the world falls in love 
 (So in love) 
 Every song you hear 
 (Happy song) 
 Seems to say 
 Merry Christmas 
 (May all) 
 May your New Year's dreams come true 
 (May may all come true) 
 And this song of mine 
 In three quarter time 
 Wishes you and yours 
 (You and yours) 
 The same thing too!

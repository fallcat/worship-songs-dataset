Ring Christmas bells 
 Ring them loud with the message bringing 
 Peace on the earth 
 Tidings of good cheer 
 Come carolers 
 Come and join with the angels singing 
 Joy to the world 
 Christmas time is here again 
 Children gather around and listen 
 You'll hear the sound 
 Of angels filling the sky 
 Telling everyone 
 Christmas time is here 
 Ring Christmas bells 
 Ring them loud with the message bringing 
 Peace on the earth 
 Tidings of good cheer 
 Come carolers 
 Come and join with the angels singing 
 Joy to the world 
 Christmas time is here again 
 Loved ones close to our hearts 
 And strangers in lands afar 
 Together share in the joy 
 Emmanuel 
 To tell the world 
 He has come to dwell 
 The time is near 
 With one voice 
 Let the world rejoice 
 Christmas time is here 
 Ring Christmas bells 
 Ring them loud with the message bringing 
 Peace on the earth 
 Tidings of good cheer 
 Come carolers 
 Come and join with the angels singing 
 Joy to the world 
 Christmas time is here again 
 Children gather around and listen 
 You'll hear the sound 
 Of angels filling the sky 
 It's Christmas time is here again

There's not a world of difference 
 Out in the world tonight 
 Between this world of people 
 Red, yellow, black and white 
 But instead of riding a rainbow of love 
 We still are fighting with prejudice gloves of anger 
 With something to claim 
 But nothing to gain, so 
 Why can't we be colour blind? 
 You know we should be living together 
 And we'd find a reason and rhyme 
 I know we would 
 'Cause we could see better 
 If we could be colour blind 
 Somebody's just assuming 
 He's up to nothing good 
 'Cause he's not like the others 
 There goes the neighbourhood 
 What kind of world are we living in 
 When we judge a man by the tone of his skin 
 It's crazy 
 'Cause he has a heart 
 Like you have a heart and 
 Why can't we be colour blind? 
 You know we should be living together 
 And we'd find a reason and rhyme 
 I know we would 
 'Cause we could see better 
 If we could be colour blind 
 It'd be so fine 
 To be colour blind 
 To open our eyes 
 And see colour blind 
 I know this world would be a better place 
 The only race would be the human race 
 All of those barriers would be erased 
 Why can't we be colour blind? 
 He has a heart like you have a heart 
 Why can't we be colour blind? 
 You know we should be living together 
 And we'd find a reason and rhyme 
 I know we would 
 'Cause we could see better 
 If we could be colour blind

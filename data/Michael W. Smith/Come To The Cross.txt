Mourner, wherever you are 
 Wherever you are at the cross there is room 
 Tell your burdened heart 
 Your burdened heart at the cross there is room 
 Tell it in the Savior's ear 
 Cast away your every fear 
 Only speak and He will hear 
 Hallelujah, everyone 
 Everyone can come to the cross 
 It doesn't matter what you've done 
 Everyone can come to the cross 
 Sinner, come today 
 Come today, at the cross there is room 
 Blessed thought for everyone 
 For everyone can come to the cross 
 Now a living fountain, see 
 Open there for you and me 
 For rich and poor, for bond and free 
 Music Interlude 
 Tell it in the Savior's ear 
 Cast away your every fear 
 Only speak and He will hear

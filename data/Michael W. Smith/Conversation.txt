Oh these days I'm at a distance 
 Sirens scream but I don't listen 
 There's a million distractions I can't escape 
 Like I'm sleepwalking now but I'm wide awake 
 And the picture I painted I want to change 
 Right now, right now 
 Bring me into the conversation 
 All my world you can see them shaking, yeah 
 I'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying 
 So bring me into the conversation, oh yeah 
 One by one we're separated 
 What I thought was love just looked like hatred 
 I've been losing myself trying to prove You wrong 
 And right now all I know is I can't go on 
 So I'm stepping across all the lines I've drawn 
 Right now, right now 
 Bring me into the conversation 
 All my world You can see them shaking, yeah 
 I'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying 
 So bring me into the conversation, oh yeah 
 I just want to talk to You 
 I just want to hear what You're saying 
 I just want to talk to You 
 I just want to hear what You're saying 
 Hear what You're saying 
 Hear what You're saying 
 Hear what You're saying 
 Bring me into the conversation 
 All my world You can see them shaking, yeah 
 I'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying... 
 You're saying 
 Con-on-on-on-versation, con-on-on-on-versation 
 I just want to talk to You 
 I just want to hear what You're saying, oh yeah 
 I just want to talk to You 
 I just want to hear what You're saying

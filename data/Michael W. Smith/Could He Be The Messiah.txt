Been here for days, I'm amazed 
 At this teacher, carpenter, preacher 
 Lost in the crowd. I hear him now. 
 He's praying and he's saying, 
 "God feed them all" 
 Five-thousand men, all of his 
 Friends are worried find 
 Bread and hurry 
 Five loaves and fish, what can he 
 Wish, he's praying still he's 
 Saying "God feed them all" 
 Could he be the Messiah? 
 Miracle man, part of the plan 
 Could he be the Messiah? 
 Life in his hand, 
 I understand he could be... 
 Meet for our needs fully he 
 Feeds our hunger older and younger 
 Twelve baskets more, 
 Can we ignore, he shows us that he 
 Knows us, is he the Christ? 
 It is he the Messiah! 
 Miracle man, part of the plan 
 It is he, the Messiah! 
 Life in his hand 
 I understand it is he

My heart is beating loud, in perfect rhythm 
 There's beauty all around, that once was hidden! 
 Waves crash all around me! 
 Broken is how You found me 
 I'm heavy like a stone, don't want to be alone now 
 The past is all I see, fading memories! 
 Somebody hid the sun, in the midnight of suffering 
 My tears are falling down, and crashing like waves 
 Somebody stole the day, and took Your light from me 
 I'll never be the same, roll this stone away 
 My heart is beating fast, loud and clearer 
 The promises at last, are coming nearer! 
 Waves crash all around me! Oh-ooh! 
 Broken is how You found me! 
 I'm heavy like a stone, don't want to be alone now 
 Will this pain ever be, a fading memory?! 
 Somebody hid the sun, in the midnight of suffering 
 My tears are falling down, and crashing like waves 
 Somebody stole the day, and took Your light from me 
 I'll never be the same, roll this stone away 
 You roll the stone away! 
 You roll the stone away-ay-'y-ay 
 Oh-ooh! Oh-ooh! 
 Somebody hears the Son, in the midnight of suffering 
 My tears are falling down, and crashing like waves 
 Somebody stole the pain, a thief in the night came 
 I'll never be the same, You rolled this stone away 
 Ooh, I'll never be the same, You rolled this stone away 
 My heart is beating loud, in perfect rhythm

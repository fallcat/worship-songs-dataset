Words: Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick

 Ink and paper, epic offers 
 Glass moon waltzing on the waters 
 Horse and carriage 
 I am courting the marriage 
 Of dreams in the wings 
 Of visions unseen 
 Cross my heart 
 Only your love will do 
 Cross my heart over you 
 Cross my heart 
 There is room enough for two 
 Cross my heart over you, over You 
 Inside, feels like there's a thunder 
 Spellbound, you've take me under 
 Gold and diamond 
 Ever saying that I'm in this forevermore 
 You can be sure

Where do you stand 
 What is your statement 
 What is it you're trying to say 
 What's in your hand 
 What's in your basement 
 What's in the cards you don't play 
 Are you holding the key 
 Or are you intending 
 To pick the lock of heaven's gate 
 It's confusing to me 
 The message you're sending 
 And I don't know if I can relate 
 What's your line 
 Tell me why you wear your cross of gold 
 State of mind 
 Or does it find a way into your soul 
 Is it a flame 
 Is it a passion 
 A symbol of love living in you 
 (Living in you) 
 Or is it a game 
 Religion in fashion 
 Some kind of phase you're going through 
 We all travel the extremes 
 From cellar to rafter 
 Looking for a place in the sun 
 So I'm trying to see 
 What you're headed after 
 But I don't know where you're coming from 
 Whoa, oh, what's your line 
 Tell me why you wear your cross of gold 
 State of mind 
 Or does it find a way into your soul 
 What's your line 
 Tell me why you wear your cross of gold 
 For some it's simply something 
 To wear around your neck 
 Just a chain, jewelry 
 It's a decoration, it's an icon, a proclamation 
 An icon of what 
 For some it's simply something 
 To wear around your neck, just a chain 
 It means a lot more than that to me 
 What's your line 
 Tell me why you wear your cross of gold 
 State of mind 
 Or does it find a way into your soul 
 What's your line 
 Tell me why you wear your cross of gold 
 State of mind 
 Or does it find a way into your soul 
 Wanna tell me why, please tell me why 
 You wear your cross of gold

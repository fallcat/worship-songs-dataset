Crown Him with many crowns 
 The lamb upon the throne 
 Hark! How the heav'nly anthem drowns 
 All music but it's own! 
 Awake, my soul, and sing 
 Of Him who died for thee. 
 And hail Him as thy matchless king 
 Through all eternity 
 Crown Him with many crowns (2x) 
 Crown Him the Lord of heav'n 
 One with the Father known 
 One with the spirit through Him giv'n 
 From yonder glorious throne 
 To thee be endless praise 
 For thou hasat died for me 
 Be thou, O Lord, through endless days 
 Adored and magnified 
 Crown Him with many crowns 
 His glories now we sing 
 Who died and rose on high 
 Who died eternal life to bring 
 And lives that death may die 
 Crown Him with many crowns (Repeat to end)

My life is like a racing car 
 Hurtling towards the wall 
 At the speed of sound 
 My time has been so finely tuned 
 But I've never seen a human being 
 So tightly wound 
 At times it seems beyond belief 
 I just need a bit of relief 
 Like a war-weary soldier 
 Marching up and over the edge 
 Take my hand and pull me up 
 'Cause I'm falling too fast 
 Somehow I've lost my way 
 I'm cryin' save me 
 Can You hear me? I'm calling out 
 I'm crying out, a cry for love 
 I can feel You, You're touching me 
 You're healing me, my cry for love 
 I will be the first to admit 
 I don't have strength 
 To handle it alone anymore 
 I don't have to fret, don't have to explain 
 All my worrying's in vain 
 I'm not alone anymore 
 Why is this so hard to believe? 
 What is mine is mine to freely receive 
 Like the changing of seasons 
 This is the beauty of the word 
 And for all that I have seen and heard 
 Oh, I want to come home 
 Somehow I'll make my way 
 My way home to You 
 Can You hear me? I'm calling out 
 I'm crying out, a cry for love 
 I can feel You, You're touching me 
 You're healing me, my cry for love 
 Oh, Father hear my call 
 (Oh, Father hear my call) 
 I know You'll catch me when I fall 
 Oh, Father hear my call 
 I know You'll catch me when I fall 
 Oh, I pray that You'll hold me now, hold me 
 (And take my fear away) 
 I'm cryin' save me 
 Oh, I know that You can hear me 
 Hear me crying out for love 
 Oh, I know that You can feel 
 My cry for love, ooh 
 I can hear You calling out 
 Crying out, a cry for love 
 I can feel You touching me 
 You're healing me, my cry for love 
 I can hear You calling out 
 Crying out, a cry for love 
 I can feel You touching me 
 You're healing me, my cry for love

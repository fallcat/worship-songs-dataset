Sitting at Your feet is where I wanna be 
 I'm home when I am here with You 
 Ruined by Your grace, enamored by Your gaze 
 I can't resist the tenderness in You 
 I'm deep in love with You, Abba Father 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 My heart it beats for You, precious Jesus 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 Humbled and amazed that You would call my name 
 I never have to search again 
 There's a deep desire that's burning like a fire 
 To know You as my closest friend 
 I'm deep in love with You, Abba Father 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 My heart it beats for You, precious Jesus 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 I'm deep in love with You, Abba Father 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 My heart it beats for You, precious Jesus 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 Lord my redeemer, Your blood runs through my veins 
 My love for You is deeper than it was yesterday 
 I enter through the curtain and parted by Your grace 
 Lord You're the lover of my soul 
 You're the lover of my soul 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 I'm deep in love with You, Abba Father 
 I'm deep in love with You, Lord 
 My heart it beats for You, precious Jesus

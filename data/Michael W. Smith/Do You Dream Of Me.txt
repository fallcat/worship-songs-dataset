Dreams, within the still of night 
 On wings of hope take flight, inside of me, oh 
 There, upon some distant shore 
 We want for nothing more than what will be 
 And you and I, here we are 
 I wonder as we come this far 
 If I could only read your mind 
 Tell me the answer I would find 
 Do you dream of me? 
 And when you're smiling in your sleep 
 Beyond the promises we keep 
 Do you dream of me? 
 Love has found a magic space 
 A deep and hidden place where time stands still 
 Now I hold you in my arms 
 You know you hold my heart and always will 
 And you and I, here we are 
 And it's a wonder that we've come this far 
 And after all that we've been through 
 You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you 
 Do you dream of me? 
 And when you're smiling in your sleep 
 Beyond the promises we keep 
 Do you dream of me? 
 If I could only read your mind 
 Tell me the answer I would find 
 Do you dream of me? 
 And when you're smiling in your sleep 
 Beyond the promises we keep 
 Do you dream of me? 
 And after all that we've been through 
 You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you 
 Do you dream of me? 
 Do you dream of me?

I remember when you took a stand 
 With the pearl of wisdom in your hand 
 And a soul of desire 
 You held your own against the world 
 A lion's heart in a little girl 
 So unafraid of the fire 
 But those days don't last 
 Sweet dreams die fast 
 A stumble when you walk on the wire 
 When all your friends 
 Start giving in 
 The flames are burning higher and higher 
 Don't give up, Andrea 
 Got the whole world at your feet 
 Just keep on - holding on 
 This is where you need to be 
 All the days that you've been spending 
 Spinning while your heart's descending 
 Like a stone in the ocean 
 Sometimes when you think the world is ending 
 It's really just a new beginning 
 The other side of emotion 
 But I've seen your eyes -no compromise 
 When you set your mind on a matter 
 Be strong through the tears 
 And your sight will clear 
 You're gonna get what you're after 
 Don't give up, Andrea 
 Got the whole world at your feet 
 Just keep on - holding on 
 This is where you need to be 
 Don't give up, Andrea 
 Got the whole world at your feet 
 Just keep on - holding on 
 This is where you need to be 
 Don't be surprised when the road divides 
 Just take the one less traveled by 
 Don't give up, Andrea 
 Got the whole world at your feet 
 Just keep on - holding on 
 This is where you need to be 
 Don't give up, Andrea 
 Got the whole world at your feet 
 Just keep on - holding on 
 This is where you need to be 
 Don't give up, Andrea (Andrea) 
 Got the whole world at your feet (I know you're gonna make it) 
 Just keep on - holding on (Andre-a) 
 This is where you need to be 
 Don't give up, Andrea (Andrea) 
 Got the whole world at your feet (I know you're gonna make it) 
 Just keep on - holding on (Andre-a) 
 This is where you need to be

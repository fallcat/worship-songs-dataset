(Michael W. Smith) 
 I will run and not be weak 
 Hope has come 
 Renewed my strength 
 I have found what I did seek 
 And I'm ready to fly 
 All forgiven, all forgot 
 Heaven waits beyond the plot 
 Swing low, sweet chariot 
 Yes, I'm ready to fly 
 Father come to save my soul 
 Father come to 
 Make me whole 
 There was a price 
 He paid the toll 
 Gave me freedom to fly 
 And every battle, every war 
 You will be my shield and my sword 
 You know I'm waiting on You Lord 
 You give me freedom to fly 
 Watch the eagles fly 
 Gonna set your feet on high 
 On the wind, like a dove 
 Go on and fly 
 In the shadow of love 
 Fly, gonna fly 
 Yes, I'm watching you fly 
 He set your feet on high 
 On the wind, like a dove 
 Go on and fly 
 In the shadow of love

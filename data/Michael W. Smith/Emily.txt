Caught 
 In an endless time 
 Waiting for a sign 
 To show you where to go 
 Lost 
 In a silent stare 
 Looking Anywhere 
 For answers you don't know 
 On the wire 
 Balancing your dreams 
 Hoping ends will meet their means 
 But you feel alone 
 Uninspired 
 Well does it help you to 
 Know that I believe in you 
 You're an angel waiting for wings 
 Emily 
 You 
 Going through this stage 
 It's a restless age 
 Young and insecure 
 Still 
 There are doubts to fade 
 Moments to be made 
 And one of them is yours 
 On the wire 
 Balancing your dreams 
 Hoping ends will meet their means 
 But you feel alone 
 Uninspired 
 Well does it help you to 
 Know that I believe in you 
 You're an angel waiting for wings 
 Emily

Words and Music: Mike Hudson and Michael W. Smith 
 On the day 
 You were saved 
 Heaven and hell marked you down 
 Angels praise 
 Devils raged 
 Life became a battleground 
 So when hell starts to move 
 And the enemy marches on you 
 Hang on, it's a fight 
 You've been marked by the army of night 
 You're a target 
 When your heart 
 Loved the dark 
 Hell could just leave you alone 
 With your life 
 Filled with light 
 You have become quite a foe 
 So when hell starts to move 
 And the enemy marches on you 
 Hang on, it's a fight 
 It's a battle of darkness and light 
 When things get bad and you can't stand to look 
 It's time to read to the end of the book 
 Don't put it down till you get to the end 
 When Jesus come and His Kingdom begins 
 Till He comes 
 God the Son 
 Teaches us to use the sword 
 And every fight 
 Has a light 
 When you know we win the war 
 So when hell starts to move 
 And the enemy marches on you 
 Hang on, it's a fight 
 You're a part of the army of light

It's like starin' at the sky above 
 When I look in your eyes 
 Now where in the world did you come from? 
 You're so beautiful 
 And I know 
 I can't escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 I can't escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Everytime I turn around you're there 
 I get a feelin' that won't go away 
 Nothing else in this whole world compares 
 You're surrounding me 
 And I know 
 That I can't escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 I can't escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 And in the righteous crowd 
 Your face is all I see 
 I hope you know by now 
 That I just can't escape 
 I can't escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 I can't escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Escape your love 
 Oh yeah

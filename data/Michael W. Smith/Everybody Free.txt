The longing in my heart has stirred a faded memory 
 Of my young heart beating fast behind the willow tree 
 I was counting out loud, and I only peeked a time or two 
 And the only purpose in my life was finding you 
 Singing, "Ollie, Ollie, everybody free!" 
 Now was I chasing you or were you chasing me? 
 We all grow up and put away our childhood games 
 But deep inside I wonder if we really change 
 "'Cause I'm still seeking, though I've learned to hide so well 
 And I can still remember how it felt 
 Singing, "Ollie, Ollie everybody free!" 
 Will I ever find someone pursuing me? 
 And then you caught me by surprise 
 I found my tears are in your eyes 
 I hear my heart inside of you 
 At last I've found somebody who 
 Can free my soul 
 And love me too 
 I can't believe we hide so long and run so well 
 When all the while we're aching to be caught and held 
 But it's only in surrender that our freedom comes 
 And so I run abandoned to your waiting arms 
 Singing, "Ollie, Ollie everybody free! 
 I belong to you and you belong to me! 
 ...Singin' "Ollie, Ollie, everybody free!"

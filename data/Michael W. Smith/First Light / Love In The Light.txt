Darkness thick and heavy, 
 Black and steady screaming darkness 
 Anyone who hates his brother, 
 Who plans evil for another 
 Walks in darkness 
 Sonlight, warm and shining, 
 Purifying, welcome Sonlight 
 Everyone who loves completely 
 With a heart that opens freely 
 Walks in Sonlight 
 Let us love in the light 
 For love is from God 
 If we love what is right 
 We show whose we are 
 In a world of the dying 
 We're living our parts 
 If we love in the light 
 With all of our hearts 
 Blindness, terrifying, left for dying, spirit blindness 
 Anyone who thirsts for evil plots 
 His very own upheaval 
 Lost in blindness 
 New sight, truth unending, faith unbending, new sight 
 Everyone who seeks the father leaves the world 
 And all its bother 
 Sees with new sight

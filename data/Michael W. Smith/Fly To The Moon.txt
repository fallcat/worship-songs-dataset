Fly to the moon 
 Well, you could do it if you wanted to 
 Try flying high 
 The only limit is the endless sky 
 So, go on and fly to the moon 
 Live in the sun 
 You know your living has just begun 
 So much ahead 
 Don't let the night leave you for dead 
 So, come on, live in the sun 
 Fly to the moon 
 And when you find your wings I will celebrate with you 
 Watch you as you soar 
 Take the wishes that are yours 
 And let them fly you to the moon 
 Dream on a star 
 You can let it take you near or far 
 Feet on the ground 
 Don't let anybody hold you down 
 So, go on and dream on a star 
 Fly to the moon 
 And when you find your wings 
 I will celebrate with you 
 Watch you as you soar 
 Take the wishes that are yours 
 I know you can fly to the moon 
 You can do all things 
 I will celebrate with you 
 It's hard to let you go 
 Still, you have to go, 
 I know 
 So go on, fly to the moon 
 And as you spread your wings 
 I will celebrate with you 
 Hope we taught you good 
 Hope you know that if I could 
 I would fly away with you 
 Gotaa take it all the way 
 When you follow dreams 
 Follow far 
 Flying high and away 
 You're flying all the way 
 To the moon

Took a step in the night, didn't know I was ready 
 Took a shot in the dark but I knew You would show me 
 Put my feet on the path but I'm stepping in your shadow 
 Not sure where to land but I knew how to follow 
 But as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright 
 I know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright 
 You're my guiding light, light, light 
 You show me the way and I hit the ground running 
 Every step that I took didn't know what was coming 
 When the days got long and the road got narrow 
 I remember what you said that I'd never be alone 
 But as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright 
 I know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright 
 You're my guiding light, light, light 
 You're my guiding light, light, light 
 Light, light 
 No, I'm not turning back even when the fight comes 
 Keep pressing on, keep pressing on, keep pressing on 
 No, I'm not looking back even in the battle 
 I keep pressing on, keep pressing on, keep pressing on, yeah 
 Everywhere that I ran took me to the beginning 
 When You called me Your son and 
 You said You would lead me 
 Everything that I am is the man You made me 
 Everything You've done made my life, made my life... worth living 
 But as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright 
 I know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright 
 You're my guiding light, light, light 
 You're my guiding light, light, light 
 I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright 
 I'm walking, oh I'm walking 
 As long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright

Sittin' in the rain 
 Water on your brain 
 Got a hole in your boat 
 Trying to stay afloat 
 Has got you down 
 I've got a wind in my sail 
 Rubber boots and a pail 
 I'll throw you a line 
 Rest assured that I 
 Won't ever let you drown 
 'Cause when you're up against the wall 
 You know I'll be here for you, for you 
 When you rise and when you fall 
 I'll always be here for you, for you 
 When the plans you make 
 Fall through and take you 
 For a loop 
 Or some bird has flown the coop 
 And left you stranded 
 Just lean on me 
 And together you see 
 We'll carry the load 
 Even if we don't 
 Quite understand it 
 'Cause when you're up against the wall 
 You know I'll be here for you, for you 
 When you rise and when you fall 
 I'll always be here for you, for you 
 'Cause when you're up against the wall 
 You know I'll be here for you, for you 
 When you rise and when you fall 
 I'll always be here for you, for you

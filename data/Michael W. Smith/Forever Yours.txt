I'm swept away in this moment 
 I feel your heartbeat next to mine 
 My hands are trembling 
 Its overwhelming 
 A whisper breaks through the silence 
 A vow to test the breath of time 
 Until forever I'll be forever yours 
 Not just tonight I'm by your side 
 For all your life 
 Till death comes between us 
 And the heavens steal you away 
 I'll stay, yours forever 
 Don't you worry, don't be afraid 
 A heart can shift like a shadow 
 The deepest passion start to wake 
 Stay ever tender, never surrender 
 Come waltz with me through the twilight 
 And we will dance as seasons pass 
 We move together 
 I'll be forever yours 
 So hold me tight 
 Say you'll be mine, for all your life 
 Till death comes between us 
 And the heavens steal you away 
 I'll stay yours forever 
 Don't you worry, don't be afraid 
 Come what may 
 So what we have is this moment 
 But moments come and go so fast 
 Until forever, I'll be forever yours 
 There is no other, I am forever yours

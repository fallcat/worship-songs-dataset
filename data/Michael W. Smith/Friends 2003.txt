Packing up the dreams, God planted 
 In the fertile soil of you 
 I can't believe the hopes He's granted 
 Means a chapter in your life is through 
 We'll keep you close as always 
 It won't even seem you've gone 
 'Cause our hearts in big and small ways 
 Will keep the love that keeps us strong 
 And friends are friends forever 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 And a friend will not say, "Never" 
 'Cause the welcome will not end 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 In the Father's hands, we know 
 That a lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends 
 With the faith and love, God's given, yeah 
 Oh springing from the hope we know 
 We will pray the joy you'll live in 
 Is the strength that now you show, yes 
 But we'll keep you close (so close, so close) as always 
 It won't even seem you've gone (you are gone) 
 'Cause our hearts, in big an' small ways 
 Will keep the love that keeps us strong  (so strong, so strong) 
 And friends are friends forever 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 And a friend will not say, "Never" 
 'Cause the welcome will not end 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 In the Father's hands, we know, yeah 
 That a lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends 
 Oh, to live as friends 
 And friends are friends forever 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 And a friend will not say, "Never" 
 Cause the welcome will not end 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 In the Father's hands we know 
 That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends 
 And friends are friends forever 
 A lifetime's not too long 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 And friends are friends forever 
 Never say, never say, "Never" 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 In the Father's hands we know 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 A lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends

Packing up the dreams God planted 
 In the fertile soil of you 
 I can't believe the hopes He's granted 
 Means a chapter of your life is through 
 But we'll keep you close as always 
 It won't even seem you've gone 
 'Cause our hearts in big and small ways 
 Will keep the love that keeps us strong 
 And friends are friends forever 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 And a friend will not say never 
 'Cause the welcome will not end 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 In the Father's hands we know 
 That a lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends 
 And with the faith and love God's given 
 Springing from the hope we know 
 We will pray the joy you live in 
 Is the strength that now you show 
 We'll keep you close as always 
 It won't even seem you've gone 
 'Cause our hearts in big and small ways 
 Will keep the love that keeps us strong 
 And friends are friends forever 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 And a friend will not say never 
 'Cause the welcome will not end 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 In the Father's hands we know 
 That a lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends 
 And friends are friends forever 
 If the Lord's the Lord of them 
 And a friend will not say never 
 'Cause the welcome will not end 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 In the Father's hands we know 
 That a lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends 
 To live as friends 
 Though it's hard to let you go 
 In the Father's hands we know 
 That a lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends 
 No a lifetime's not too long 
 To live as friends

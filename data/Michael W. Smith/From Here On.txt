Michael w. smith 
 You must have felt alone 
 Reaching through your doubt 
 But I never meant to close you out 
 While I was building dreams 
 You were building fears 
 And I was the cause of all those tears 
 But can I start over and break new ground? 
 I know I've let you down (oh babe...) 
 Do you feel the weight of the world 
 Heavy on your shoulders 
 Well, let my love take you down another road 
 And lighten up the load 
 From here on 
 Many were the times I failed to follow through 
 Of pieces of heaven I promised you 
 It wasn't paradise, it wasn't even close 
 And I hurt the one I love the most 
 And sorry could never be good enough 
 But I will make it up to you... 
 I know you feel the weight of the world 
 Heavy on your shoulders 
 Let my love take you down another road 
 And lighten up the load 
 From here on

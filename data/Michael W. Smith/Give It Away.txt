She asked him for forever 
 And a promise that would last 
 He said, "Babe, you know I love you 
 But I can't commit to that" 
 She said, "Love isn't love 
 Till You give it away" 
 A father lived in silence 
 Saw his son become a man 
 There was a distance felt between them 
 'Cause he could not understand 
 That love isn't love 
 Till you give it away 
 You gotta give it away 
 As we live 
 Moving side by side 
 May we learn to give 
 (May we learn to give) 
 Learn to sacrifice 
 We can entertain compassion 
 For a world in need of care 
 But the road of good intentions 
 Doesn't lead to anywhere 
 'Cause love isn't love 
 Till you give it away, yeah 
 You gotta give it away 
 As we live 
 Moving side by side 
 May we learn to give 
 (May we learn to give) 
 Learn to sacrifice 
 Love is like a river 
 Flowing down from the Giver of life 
 We drink from the water 
 And our thirst is no longer denied 
 You gotta give it away 
 As we live 
 Moving side by side 
 (Moving side by side) 
 May we learn to give 
 (May, may, may we learn to give) 
 Learn to sacrifice 
 There was a man who walked on water 
 He came to set the people free 
 He was the ultimate example 
 Of what love can truly be 
 'Cause His love was His life 
 And He gave it away 
 You gotta give it away 
 As we live 
 Moving side by side 
 May we learn to give 
 (May, may we learn to give) 
 Learn to sacrifice 
 You gotta give it away 
 As we live 
 (As we live) 
 Moving side by side 
 (Moving side, moving side by side) 
 May we learn to give 
 (May we, may we learn to give) 
 Learn to sacrifice 
 (Learn to sacrifice)

Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the pains 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echo back with joyous strains 
 Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 (Gloria O sing Gloria) 
 Him whose birth the angels sing 
 (Gloria O sing Gloria) 
 Come adore on bended knee 
 Christ the Lord the newborn King 
 Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo 
 Angels we have heard on high 
 (Gloria O sing Gloria) 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains 
 (Gloria O sing Gloria) 
 Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth 
 With us sing our Savior's birth 
 Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo 
 Alleluia

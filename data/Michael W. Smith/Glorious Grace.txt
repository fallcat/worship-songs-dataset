Words and music: deborah d. smith and michael w. smith 
 Let us praise the one who chose us 
 Let us thank the one who knows us 
 Set apart, blameless in his sight 
 Through the son, we have faith, we have life 
 To the praise of his glorious grace 
 May the God of our lord the almighty father 
 Give you wisdom and peace, his comforting spirit 
 That you may know his hope 
 You may know his riches 
 And you may know his mighty strength 
 To the praise of his glorious grace 
 To the praise of his glorious grace 
 Grace and peace to you through Jesus 
 Our deliverer receives us 
 Our hearts created for his word 
 Our salvation was spoken and we heard 
 To the praise of his glorious grace

I'm blazing a trail that leads to vice 
 So easily enticed 
 By darker means 
 When out of the wilderness of choice 
 I hear that one still voice 
 Call to me 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 When the evil go east 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Find a heart that's golden 
 Why must I wander like a cloud 
 Following the crowd 
 Well, I don't know 
 But I'm asking for the will to fight 
 To wear the crown of life 
 And you say go 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 When the evil go east 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Find a heart that's golden 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 When the evil go east 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Find a heart that's golden 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 The mind is weak the heart is frail 
 When it goes beyond the pale 
 So unwise 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 When the evil go east 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Find a heart that's golden 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 When the evil go east 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Find a heart that's golden 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 When the evil go east 
 Go west young man 
 Go west young man 
 Find a heart that's golden

Words and Music: Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick 
 Actions have been justified 
 All is compromised 
 Looking for approval there 
 In someone else's eyes, oh 
 Dodging all you really are 
 Becomes your greatest task 
 Acting out your lonely part 
 You hide behind your mask 
 Never true to yourself 
 Knowing well this is not like you 
 Fooling yourself 
 You're just living a lie 
 Goin' goin' 
 Goin' through the motions 
 Goin' goin' 
 Goin' through the motions 
 Goin' goin' 
 Goin' through the motions 
 Goin' goin' 
 Goin' through the motions 
 Victim of the circumstance 
 Prisoner of the shame 
 But it's the double standard life 
 That keeps you in the game 
 Taken by your own disguise 
 But when it's wearing thin 
 You'll do anything it takes 
 To impress your friends 
 Never true to yourself 
 This is not what you want to be 
 Fooling yourself 
 You're just living lie

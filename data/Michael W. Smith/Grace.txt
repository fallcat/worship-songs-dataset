I was lost when ya found me here 
 You pulled me close and held me near 
 And I'm a fool but still you love 
 I'll be your fool for the king of love 
 He gave me wings so I could fly 
 And gave me a song to color the sky 
 And all I have is all from you 
 And all I want is all of you 
 It's grace, grace 
 I'm nothing without you 
 Grace, your grace 
 Shines on me 
 And there've been days when I've walked away 
 Too much to carry 
 Nothing left to say 
 Forgive me Lord when I'm weak and lost 
 You traded heaven for a wooden cross 
 And all these years you've carried me 
 You've been my eyes when I could not see 
 And beauty grows in the driving rain 
 Your ode of gladness in the times of pain 
 It's grace, your grace 
 I'm nothing without you 
 Grace, your grace 
 Your grace, your grace 
 I'm nothing without you 
 Grace, your grace 
 Shines on me oh yeah 
 Shines on me 
 Shines on me 
 I'm everything with you 
 Shines on me 
 Shines on me 
 It's your grace 
 Shines on me 
 Your grace 
 Oh 
 Your grace it shines on me 
 Your grace 
 Your grace 
 Shines on me 
 Shines on me 
 Your grace it shines on me 
 Your grace

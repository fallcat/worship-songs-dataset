Providence, Providence 
 See it laying down the cornerstone 
 The Hand of Providence, it's evident 
 For we could never make it on our own 
 Apportioning the power 
 Weighing all that it entails 
 Giving us the fulcrum 
 And a balance to the scales 
 Oh, the Hand of Providence 
 Is guiding us through choices that we make 
 Oh, the Hand of Providence 
 Is reaching out to help us on our way 
 Providence, ever since 
 Any thesis ever entered man 
 The Hand of Providence 
 Has been our best defense 
 Tho' his ways are sometimes hard to understand 
 From the dying of a hearbeat 
 To another soul reborn 
 From in between and circling 
 Our thoughts of love and war

Let the tempest and the flood 
 Shake your soul and spill your blood 
 Like an old song 
 Keep hold'n on 
 Let the people laugh at you 
 Call you names and say you're through 
 Never let go 
 Keep hangin' on 
 Hang on, hang on 
 Can you hear me, 
 I'm gonna say it again 
 Hang on, hang on 
 Never giving up, no, never giving in 
 Hang on every hopeful word 
 Even when it seems absurd 
 Keep holdin' on 
 If you triumph when you fail 
 Keep your head when you prevail 
 Be a hero 
 Keep hangin' around 
 Hang on, hang on 
 Are you listening, 
 Let me say it again 
 Hang on, hang on 
 Never giving up, no, 
 Never giving in

Oh the happiest Christmas 
 Is a homecoming Christmas 
 With the snow fluttering down till the world seems new 
 Bright candles burning 
 Old friends returning 
 The wishes of children coming true 
 And the happiest wishes are just old fashioned wishes 
 May your days be merry, your sorrows be small 
 May the ones you love be near you 
 That's the happiest Christmas of all

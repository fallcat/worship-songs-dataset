Healing rain is coming down 
 It's coming nearer to this old town 
 Rich and poor, weak and strong 
 It's bringing mercy, it won't be long 
 Healing rain is coming down 
 It's coming closer to the lost and found 
 Tears of joy, and tears of shame 
 Are washed forever in Jesus' name 
 Healing rain, it comes with fire 
 So let it fall and take us higher 
 Healing rain, I'm not afraid 
 To be washed in Heaven's rain 
 Lift your heads, let us return 
 To the mercy seat where time began 
 And in your eyes, I see the pain 
 Come soak this dry heart with healing rain 
 And only You, the Son of man 
 Can take a leper and let him stand 
 So lift your hands, they can be held 
 By someone greater, the great I Am 
 Healing rain, it comes with fire 
 So let it fall and take us higher 
 Healing rain, I'm not afraid 
 To be washed in Heaven's rain 
 To be washed in Heaven's rain... 
 Healing rain is falling down 
 Healing rain is falling down 
 I'm not afraid 
 I'm not afraid...

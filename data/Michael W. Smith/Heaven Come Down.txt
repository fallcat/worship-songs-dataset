Oh, Heaven come down tonight 
 We wanna see Your glory shine 
 Burnin' like a flame, burnin' like a flame forever 
 I am broken 
 Nothin' I can do 
 I'm callin' out to You 
 Bringin' You a heart that's open 
 Come and light a fire 
 Come and light a fire 
 In this moments 
 Hear me cryin' out 
 I'm reachin' for You now 
 Bringin' You a heart that's open 
 And broken 
 Oh, heaven come down tonight 
 We wanna see Your glory shine 
 Burnin' like a flame, burnin' like a flame forever 
 Break every stronghold 
 Shatter every wall so we can see 
 Heaven come down tonight 
 Oh, we are broken 
 Here before You now 
 God we're cryin' out 
 Bringing You a heart that's open 
 Come and light a fire 
 Come and light a fire 
 Like an ocean 
 Washin' over us 
 Strong and glorious 
 Your love has spoken (spoken) 
 And our hearts are open (open, open, open) 
 Oh, heaven come down tonight 
 We wanna see Your glory shine 
 Burnin' like a flame, burnin' like a flame forever 
 Break every stronghold 
 Shatter every wall so we can see 
 Heaven come down tonight, tonight, tonight Hey! 
 Oh, heaven come down tonight 
 We wanna see Your glory shine 
 Burnin' like a flame, burnin' like a flame forever 
 Break every stronghold 
 Shatter every wall so we can see 
 Heaven come down, Heaven come down tonight 
 Break every stronghold 
 Shatter every wall so we can see 
 Heaven come down, Heaven come down tonight

See the Teacher, sitting on a mountain 
 See Him walking along the shore 
 Friends and disciples gathering around Him 
 Say never spake a man like this before 
 But why's a man as wise as He 
 Weeping alone in Gethsemane 
 And did He know some would never see 
 The Heaven in His eyes 
 See the Master walking on the water 
 Hear Him speak and calm an angry wave 
 Look at Him raise up Jairus's daughter 
 And with a word Lazarus comes forth from the grave 
 But why is a man as strong as this 
 Being betrayed by a good friend's kiss 
 And could it be that maybe this man missed 
 The Heaven in His eyes 
 And I'm not talking about the pie in the sky 
 That you good boys and girls get in the by and by 
 But rather the strength, the strength that we can find 
 If we've got the guts to try 
 See the Teacher playing with the children 
 Hear Him baffle doctors of the law 
 Look at the people gathering to go with Him 
 Those who see the vision that He saw 
 This is why a man as holy as He 
 Had to die alone on Calvary 
 It was the only way that we could ever see 
 The Heaven in His eyes 
 The Heaven in His eyes 
 The Heaven in His eyes 
 Yeah, the Heaven in His eyes 
 The Heaven in His eyes

Where's the Navigator of your destiny? 
 Where is the Dealer of this hand? 
 Who can explain life and its brevity? 
 'Cause there is nothing here that I can understand 
 You and I have barely met 
 And I just don't want to let go of you yet 
 Noah, hello, good-bye 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 Noah, sweet child of mine 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 And so I hold your tiny hand in mine 
 For the hardest thing I've ever had to face 
 Heaven calls for you before it calls for me 
 When you get there save me a place 
 A place where I can share your smile 
 And I can hold you for more than just awhile 
 Noah, hello, good-bye 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 Noah, sweet child of mine 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 I'll see you on 
 I'll see you on 
 I'll see you on 
 I'll see you on 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 Noah, hello, good-bye 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 Noah, sweet child of mine 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 Oh, Noah, hello, good-bye 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 Oh, Noah, sweet child of mine 
 I'll see you on the other side 
 On the other side

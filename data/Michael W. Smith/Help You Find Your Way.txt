It can be wise 
 Or it can be a paradox 
 To seek solace in your solitude 
 And when it feels 
 Like you're living in a box 
 You need someone who believes in you 
 A promise true when tried 
 I'll be right here by your side 
 So whenever your need be 
 Know that you can lean on me 
 I'll help you find your way 
 I'll help you find your way 
 When you're lost in all the madness 
 When you're blinded by your doubt 
 When you need someone to be there for you 
 I'll help you find your way 
 Don't keep your thoughts 
 Locked behind your cellar door 
 All shrouded in a mystery 
 Just let them out 
 That's what friends are for 
 To give without giving the "third degree" 
 No need to be ashamed 
 I've been through it just the same 
 So when your path misleads 
 Know that you can call on me

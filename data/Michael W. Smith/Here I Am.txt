There's a place where I can go 
 Where the angels hear me pray 
 "I want to change 
 Yes I need Your touch" 
 I'm waiting here for You 
 And I fall, at Your feet 
 I'll give it all, until the day we meet 
 Here I am 
 Ready to give up my life for the One 
 Ready to pour out my heart for the Son 
 Here I am 
 Here I come to Your threshing floor 
 Where the angels fear to tread 
 I'm waiting here for the King of love 
 And to hold the hands that bled 
 And I fall, at Your feet 
 I'll give it all, until the day we meet 
 (Repeat x 2) 
 Here I am 
 Ready to give up my life for the One 
 Ready to pour out my heart for the Son

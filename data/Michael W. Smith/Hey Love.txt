Now everything is still The bedlam 
 And the noise at bay 
 And all the busy birds have flown 
 My melancholy heart 
 Is beating with the perfect peace 
 One that I have always known 
 Hey love it's me 
 Hey love it's me 
 I need you at the closing of the day 
 I need you when the night has peeled away 
 In other words I need you always 
 I'm coming with a million songs to sing 
 Still there not a word for everything 
 I want to say love, but anyway love 
 Let me start with this 
 Oh hey love (hey love) 
 We're circling the sun 
 We're basking in the afterglow 
 It's back around to me and you 
 Come sail away with me 
 We can talk about old times 
 We're heading into something new 
 Hey love it's me 
 Hey love it's me 
 I want you like I wanted you back then 
 I want you more today than I did then 
 In other words I want you always 
 Let me tell you now for what it's worth 
 I would move the heavens and the earth 
 Everyday love, in every way love 
 Just to be with you! 
 Hey love, hey love 
 I need you at the closing of the day 
 I need you you when the night has peeled away 
 In other words I need you always! 
 Come what may love, You light my way love 
 Angel of my dreams 
 Oh hey love 
 Hey love, hey love 
 Hey love... hey love

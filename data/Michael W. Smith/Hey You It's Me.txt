Hey you - things to do 
 Live the life for faith and family 
 It's tough, with all that stuff 
 Filling your head 
 We know the undertow 
 Could get us so we don't remember, but 
 Lest we ever 
 Lest we ever forget 
 Hey you, it's me 
 True lovers are we 
 Children under the sun 
 Two spirits in the name of one 
 Hey me - got to be 
 Places to go and people there to see 
 No space for back to base 
 And no time at all 
 We talk, walk the walk 
 Run the race and climb the ladder, but 
 If we ever 
 If we ever should fall 
 Sometimes the smoke clears 
 And I see things how they are 
 I see how we have come so far

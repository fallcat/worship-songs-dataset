I'm not a stranger to storms 
 Even in the flood 
 I can always run 
 To where You are 
 I've had to wait in the dark 
 And hold the truth in my heart 
 Even in the night 
 Still You open wide 
 Your faithful arms 
 And I hide myself 
 Where I find my help 
 And I hide myself 
 I find only rest 
 Find only peace 
 Beneath Your wings 
 You are the refuge that stands 
 You hold my world in Your hands 
 The quiet in the noise 
 The stillness of Your voice 
 Will be enough 
 And I hide myself 
 Where I find my help 
 And I hide myself 
 I find only rest 
 I find only peace 
 And I hide myself 
 Where I find my help 
 And I hide myself 
 I find only rest 
 Find only peace 
 Beneath Your wings 
 And it's Your presence alone 
 That changes all that I know 
 'Til all that I know 
 Is just Your presence alone 
 I'm safe in Your shadow 
 And I hide myself 
 Where I find my help 
 And I hide myself 
 I find only rest 
 I find only peace 
 And I hide myself 
 Where I find my help 
 And I hide myself 
 I find only rest 
 Find only peace 
 Beneath Your wings 
 Even in the flood 
 I can always run 
 To where You are

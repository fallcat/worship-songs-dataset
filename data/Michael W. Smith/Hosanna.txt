Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord 
 Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna 
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord 
 Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna 
 King of Israel welcome to our hearts 
 Here to reign in righteousness 
 Oh Ruler of the world, Ruler of our hearts 
 Now ascend Your throne 
 You are the King of Kings 
 Hosanna 
 To Jerusalem, to the sons of man 
 Riding on in gentle strength 
 Oh come to save Your own, come to give Your life 
 The Kingdom is at hand 
 You are the King of Kings 
 Hosanna 
 King of Israel welcome to our hearts 
 Here to reign in righteousness 
 Oh Ruler of the world, Ruler of our hearts 
 Now ascend Your throne 
 You are the King of Kings 
 Hosanna

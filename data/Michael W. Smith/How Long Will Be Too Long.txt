(Tell me) How long will we grovel at the feet of wealth and power 
 (Tell me) How long will we bow down to that golden calf 
 How long will be too long 
 (Tell me) How long will we curtsy to the whims of new religion 
 How long will we water down the truth 
 'Til truth is no more 
 How long will be too long 
 The power of faith and love 
 Can change the stuff we're made of 
 But still we wait 
 (Tell me) How long will be too long 
 (Tell me) How long will we drink from the chalice of indifference 
 Neither be hot or be cold 
 Can a sober soul know 
 How long will be too long 
 Is there not more to us 
 Than cursed dust to dust 
 I feel my hope fading 
 How long will be too long 
 How long will be too long 
 (Tell me) How long will we travel 
 From the ways that God intended, yeah 
 Won't it all tumble down if His holy wrath comes 
 How long will be too long 
 The power of faith and love 
 Can change the stuff we're made of 
 Oh, when will it be too late 
 How long will be too long 
 How long will be too long 
 How long will be too long

Tell me when the time we had slipped away 
 Tomorrow turned to yesterday 
 And I don't know how 
 Tell me what can stop this river of tears 
 It's been building up for years 
 For this moment now 
 Here I stand 
 Arms open wide 
 I've held ya close 
 Kept ya safe 
 Till you could fly 
 Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend 
 And how to harness up the wind 
 And how to say goodbye 
 Tell me why 
 Why does following your dreams 
 Take you far away from me 
 And I knew that it would 
 Tell me how to fill the space you left behind 
 And how to laugh instead of cry 
 And how to say goodbye 
 Here I stand 
 Arms open wide 
 I've held ya close 
 Kept ya safe 
 Till you could fly 
 Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend 
 And how to harness up the wind 
 And how to say goodbye

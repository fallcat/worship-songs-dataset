God, fo the love of me 
 I don't know why 
 We hurt each other 
 In the name of what is right 
 Oh what we think is right 
 God, for the life of Man's inhumanity to man 
 There's a river of sorrow 
 Running through my heart 
 Through the long night I will follow 
 The lgimmer in the dark 
 Lord, You are the human spark 
 God, for the life of me 
 I cannont explain 
 How people born of love 
 Lose there way to hate 
 Oh there's go to be a better way

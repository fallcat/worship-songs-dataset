I am not passers by 
 I am not a white lie 
 I am not left to die 
 I am love, I am love 
 I am not feeling sad 
 I am not the new fad 
 I am not quickly mad 
 I am love, I am love 
 (Chorus Part 1) 
 You can try to hide 
 You can try to run 
 But You'll never run far enough 
 This is my flesh, this is my blood 
 And I am love 
 (Chorus Part 2) 
 You can fly up high 
 You can dig down deep 
 You can flee to the west 
 You can flee to the east 
 But you can't escape what I've done 
 'Cause I am love 
 I am not standing by 
 I am not letting go 
 I am not leaving you 
 I am love, I am love 
 (Repeat entire chorus once, Repeat Pt 1 after repeat) 
 I am love 
 My blood fell like rain 
 I did not bleed in vain 
 But from my veins 
 I am love

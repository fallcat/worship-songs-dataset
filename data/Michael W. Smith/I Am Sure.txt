Looking at the future 
 Who can tell you what is going on 
 It seems we have become the generation 
 Of wars and bombs 
 And the heart grows weak 
 And the fear grows strong 
 That the day may come and it may not be very long 
 And you want to run 
 But you don't know where 
 So where do you go 
 I know 
 And I tell you 
 I am sure there will be a day 
 But it will not be like the nations say 
 The Lord will come when this life is through 
 And his deep desire is to be with you 
 Hearts will fly when the new world starts 
 And joy will rise like the morning star 
 God will meet every cry of the heart 
 And it's my prayer 
 I want you to be there 
 I like to think about the new creation 
 Things that God will do 
 So every now and then I stop and close my eyes 
 I enjoy the view 
 And the heart grows strong 
 And the fear grows weak 
 And I cannot wait for the new world to come to me 
 And while I dream 
 Oh, I pray for you 
 'Cause he wants you to go 
 I know 
 And I tell you 
 I am sure there will be a day 
 But it will not be like the nations say 
 The Lord will come when this life is through 
 And his deep desire is to be with you 
 Hearts will fly when the new world starts 
 And joy will rise like the morning star 
 God will meet every cry of the heart 
 And it's my prayer 
 I want you to be there 
 I am sure there will be a day 
 But it will not be like the nations say 
 The Lord will come when this life is through 
 And his deep desire is to be with you 
 Hearts will fly when the new world starts 
 And joy will rise like the morning star 
 God will meet every cry of the heart 
 And it's my prayer 
 I want you to be there 
 I am sure 
 That the Lord will come 
 I am sure 
 That his deep desire is to be with you 
 He wants you to be there 
 I am sure 
 That the Lord will come 
 I am sure 
 That his deep desire is to be with you

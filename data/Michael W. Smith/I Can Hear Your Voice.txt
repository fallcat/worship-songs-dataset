I'm in the river that flows from your throne 
 Water of Life 
 Water of Life 
 It Covers me and I breath again 
 Your love is breath to my soul 
 I can hear Your voice as You sing over me 
 It's Your song of Hope breathing life into me 
 I can feel Your touch as I come close to You 
 And it heals my heart 
 You restore and renew

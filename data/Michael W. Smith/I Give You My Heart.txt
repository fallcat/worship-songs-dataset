This is my desire 
 To honor You 
 Lord, with all my heart 
 I worship You 
 All I have within me 
 I give You praise 
 All that I adore 
 Is in You 
 Lord, I give You my heart 
 I give You my soul 
 I live for You alone 
 Every breath that I take 
 Every moment I'm awake 
 Lord, have Your way in me

Seems like it was only yesterday 
 She was living here 
 Yeah, she was living here 
 Lord knows why He's taken her away 
 It isn't very clear, no it isn't very clear 
 Into every life a little rain must fall 
 And losing one you love is like a storm 
 But storms are passing 
 I hear Leesha 
 Singing in heaven tonight 
 And in between the sadness 
 I hear Leesha 
 Telling me that she's all right 
 Life goes on even after life 
 That's what I believe 
 Yeah, that's what I believe 
 Leesha's gone, but she will still survive 
 In a memory that I'm keeping here with me 
 Silencing the voice of moral tragedy 
 Listening to whispers of the soul 
 All is peaceful

Who is the you that no one else can see 
 In your heart the lonely one afraid to be 
 Lost again... need a friend 
 You hide your soul 
 To keep the hurt inside 
 All alone your tears call out into the night 
 Is He there... does He care 
 Yes, I know your name 
 Every prayer you pray 
 I'm the one who brought you to this place 
 The voice who sings to you 
 The hand that clings to you 
 Oh my child, I've always known your name 
 Known your name 
 I hold you close to me, close to heart 
 And this kind of love will find you 
 Anywhere you are. 
 Never fear, I am here

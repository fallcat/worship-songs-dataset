Words and Music: Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick 
 Everybody's talkin' in the homeroom 
 Plans are being made for after school 
 Should you tell them how you're really feelin' 
 Or go along and play it cool 
 Well, I know, I know 
 How it feels, I know, I know 
 Everybody's talkin', about a good time 
 Something tells you something isn't right 
 But when you're lonely and the pressure's on you 
 It's really hard to stand and fight 
 Well, I know, I know 
 How you feel 
 Torn between the mind of the crowd 
 And the matters of the heart 
 I know, I know 
 How you feel, I know, I know 
 There's a light that holds you in the darkness 
 There's a candle burning in the wind 
 And if you can lean upon the Father 
 You can find the strength within 
 Well, I know, I know 
 That you can 
 Now it seems like everybody's against you 
 And no one really cares 
 You don't know who to trust, 
 You don't know where to turn 
 Well at least you know you've got a prayer 
 So reach out for the one who understands you 
 Oh, He's been there 
 He knows, He knows 
 How you feel 
 Well, I know, that He knows, He knows 
 I know, I know, that He knows

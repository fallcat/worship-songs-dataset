I have found here 
 Love and mercy 
 From an infinite supply 
 I have found here 
 Living water 
 From a well that won't run dry 
 At Your feet 
 I bow in wonder 
 At Your feet 
 I place my crowns 
 Let surrender be the only sound 
 At Your feet 
 I lay me down 
 Fear and failure 
 Pride and hatred 
 You see all I've tried to hide 
 But sweet mercy 
 Has embraced me 
 Wrath has turned to life divine 
 At Your feet 
 I bow in wonder 
 At Your feet 
 I place my crowns 
 Let surrender be the only sound 
 At Your feet 
 I lay me down 
 At Your feet 
 I bow in wonder 
 At Your feet 
 I place my crowns 
 Let surrender be the only sound 
 At Your feet 
 I lay me down 
 Into my emptiness 
 You speak life and give me breath 
 I lay me down 
 Undone by holiness 
 Take my all and nothing less 
 I lay me down 
 Into my emptiness 
 You speak life and give me breath 
 I lay me down 
 Undone by holiness 
 Take my all and nothing less 
 I lay me down 
 At Your feet 
 I bow in wonder 
 At Your feet 
 I place my crowns 
 Let surrender be the only sound 
 At Your feet 
 I lay me down 
 At Your feet 
 I lay me down

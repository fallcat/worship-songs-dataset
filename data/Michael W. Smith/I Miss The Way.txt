Once a true believer 
 Once there was a fire in your soul 
 You were the epitome of blessed faith astir 
 With thirst for holiness 
 And hunger for the Word 
 Now you move in other circles 
 To the beat of different drums 
 And I see only glimpses of the one you used to be 
 The inspiration that you were to me 
 I miss the way His love would dance within your eyes 
 I miss the way His heart was the soul of your life 
 And somewhere in the saddest part of heaven's room 
 Our Father sheds a tear for you 
 He's missing you, too 
 Some are calling you a prodigal 
 Some aren't calling you at all 
 But far away someone is calling you back home 
 Do you hear it anymore out there on your own 
 Once a true believer...

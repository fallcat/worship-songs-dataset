Joy to the world 
 The Lord has come 
 Let earth receive her king 
 Let every heart 
 Prepare him room 
 And heaven and nature sing 
 And heaven and nature sing 
 And Heaven, and heaven and nature sing 
 Joy to the earth 
 The Savior reigns 
 Let men their songs employ 
 While fields and floods 
 Rocks, hills, and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy 
 He rules the world 
 With truth and grace 
 And makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders of His love 
 And wonders, wonders of His love

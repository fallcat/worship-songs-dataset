I saw you, and you saw me 
 And I didn't even know your name 
 Just one look 
 That was all it took 
 And I knew I'd never be the same 
 If walking on air compares to what I feel 
 Then how can I keep it sealed, when... 
 I wanna tell the world 
 If the smile on my face 
 Hasn't given me away already 
 I wanna tell the world 
 There ain't no way to hide it 
 Your love has got me flying high 
 Since the day that you looked my way 
 I knew we were meant to be together 
 Now I thank the Lord 
 For a love like yours 
 'Cause I know it's gonna last forever 
 It's hard to believe my dreams have all come true 
 And I'm so in love with you that... 
 I wanna tell the world 
 If the smile on my face 
 Hasn't given me away already 
 I wanna tell the world 
 There ain't no way to hide it 
 Your love has got me flying high 
 I just want the world to know 
 Love has got me good to go 
 I have got to get it out 
 She is all I think about 
 It's something that I need to say 
 Love has overtaken me 
 I wanna tell the world 
 If the smile on my face 
 Hasn't given me away already 
 I wanna tell the world 
 There ain't no way to hide it 
 Your love has got me flying high

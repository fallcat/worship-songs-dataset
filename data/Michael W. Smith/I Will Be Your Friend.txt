So many memories and so many miles 
 The road that stretches behind us 
 We've had some laughter and our share of tears 
 But all these moments unite us 
 I'll be your friend for a lifetime 
 Against the wind and the rain of every season 
 Won't walk away in the hard times 
 I will be your friend 
 I'm saying I will be your friend 
 Sure as the river runs to the sea 
 High as the mountain that reaches 
 You were there by my side till the end 
 (And) helped me on my feet again 
 I'll be your friend for a lifetime 
 Against the wind and the rain of every season 
 Won't walk away in the hard times 
 I will be your friend 
 I'm saying I will be your friend 
 So in the valley walk on 
 Don't have to face it alone 
 Cause in the hard times 
 We keep growing strong 
 As we learn, as we live 
 That we live when we give 
 I'll be your friend for a lifetime 
 Against the wind and the rain of every season 
 Won't walk away in the hard times 
 I will be your friend 
 I'm saying I will be your friend

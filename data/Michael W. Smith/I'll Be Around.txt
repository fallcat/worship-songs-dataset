"Album - I'll Lead You Home" 
 Hey boy - did you find out 
 Whatcha had to know - 'n what it's all about 
 When you started to move - just a step at a time 
 You never wanted to fall 
 You took a chance on the wild side 
 Hey, girl - can'tcha come down 
 Are ya way at the top - afraid of somethin' you found 
 Then you try to go back - not as easy to do 
 Did you find who you are 
 From a dance on the wild side 
 I know sometimes it's hard for you 
 To keep your feet upon the path that you've chosen 
 It's not for you to walk alone 
 Together we can take this road where it's going - hang on 
 Stand by me - stand right here 
 The time has come to say it clear 
 Now don't give up - but don't give in 
 We will stand together to the end 
 And I'll be around - I'll be around, yeah 
 No joke - the sooner you find 
 It happens all the same - for every mother's child 
 When you walk in the dark - then you stumble and fall 
 It's a part of it all 
 When we dance on the wild side 
 But everybody needs someone 
 Who loves 'em through the toughest times - while they're growing - yah 
 Who keeps a candle burning 
 When the darkness covers up the path where they're going - hang on 
 Stand by me - stand right here 
 The time has come to say it clear 
 Now don't give up - don't give in 
 We will stand together to the end 
 And I'll be around - come what may 
 Heaven hears us when we pray 
 So don't give up - but don't give in 
 We will stand together to the end 
 I will be there, my good friend 
 And I'll be around 
 Be around, I'll be around... 
 I'll walk this road with you 
 Wherever it may wind 
 And I'll be around

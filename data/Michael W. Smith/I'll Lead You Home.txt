Wandering the road of desperate life 
 Aimlessly beneath the barren sky 
 Leave it to me, I'll lead you home 
 So afraid that you will not be found 
 It won't be long before your sun goes down 
 Just leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 Just leave it to Me 
 I'll lead you home 
 A troubled mind and a doubter's heart 
 You wonder how you ever got this far 
 Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Vultures of darkness ate the crumbs you left 
 And you got no way to retrace your steps 
 Just leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 You're lost and alone 
 Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 You're lost and alone 
 Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Let it go, yeah 
 So let it go and turn it over to 
 The One who chose to give His life for you 
 Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 So let it go and turn it over to 
 The One who chose to give His life for you 
 Just leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 You're lost and alone 
 Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 You're lost and alone 
 Just leave it to Me, I'll lead you home, yeah 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 You're lost and alone 
 Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home, yeah ... 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 Hear Me calling, hear Me calling 
 Just leave it to Me, I'll lead you home 
 Hear Me calling, hear me calling

Good morning Mr. Repo Man 
 Give me one more week, and I'll be gone. 
 It's been a long hard month of Sunday's 
 Still no rain, nothing left around here but the dust and shame 
 I know you know... mmmm, I know you know. 
 And I'm trying to find my way, to hold on to my faith 
 While I wait, for you 
 I'll wait for you 
 Now I lie awake at night, trying not to think 
 These are the hardest times I've seen 
 I'm still holding on 
 I know you never said it would be easy 
 All thick and no thin, but the man who waits is the man who wins, holding on, 
 Oh yeah, I'm holding on. 
 I'm gonna hide myself away, hide myself away, 
 And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you, 
 I'll wait for you. 
 I need you now, I need you now, Oh, oh... oh... 
 You know I need you now, oh, oh, yeah, yeah 
 And I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you, I'm gonna wait for you, 
 Oh, I wait for you. 
 I'm gonna walk on and not get weary now, I'm gonna run and not fall down. 
 I know that someday, I'll get my wings somehow, and you will carry me. you will carry me 
 I'm gonna rise up, like an eagle now, I'm gonna ride that big blue sky, 
 I'm sure that someday, all that doubt again, you will carry me, you will carry me, even now, oh yeah, 
 Even now, oh yeah, carry me even now. 
 Carry me even now. Your gonna carry me, you will carry me, you will carry me, even now 
 Oh carry me, oh yeah.

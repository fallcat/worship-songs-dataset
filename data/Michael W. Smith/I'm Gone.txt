1st Verse: 
 I see you smiling at me 
 And I fall into a daydream 
 Don't know what all of this means 
 Oh, is it love? 
 Logic is slipping away 
 My heart's on a runaway train 
 I'm gone, yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone and 
 It feels so right 
 2nd Verse: 
 Each time I look in your eyes 
 So glad you came into my life 
 Much more than an emotional high 
 Oh, this is love 
 I know that I've made up my mind 
 I'll stay for the rest of my life

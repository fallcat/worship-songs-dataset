Words and Music:Mike Hudson and Michael W. Smith 
 I am holding to the joy of my salvation 
 I am glad to have a life that always grows 
 And if the Word of God is any indication 
 I am doing even better than I know 
 I am doing even better than I know 
 There's a joy that even people of the world find 
 In every good and perfect gift the Father sends 
 So I thank the Lord that I was born the first time 
 But I thank Him more that I was born again 
 Oh, I thank Him more that I was born again 
 I am up 
 Like the sun is up 
 I can feel my life on a rise 
 I am up 
 Like the stars at night 
 I get up on bein' alive 
 I am up 
 Like the Lord is up 
 And my life is filled with His life 
 I was freed and I am saved 
 I am up 
 I am up 
 There are times life is so fine I can't contain it 
 Everywhere I look I see what God had done 
 And I don't have to work and worry to sustain it 
 When I walk with God His joy will always come 
 When I walk with God His joy will always come

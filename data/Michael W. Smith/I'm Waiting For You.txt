I walked this road 
 So very long ago 
 To show the way 
 So you would know 
 I walked the road 
 With holes in my hands and feet 
 To make the way 
 Come follow me 
 Know you are not alone 
 You will be free indeed 
 The journey begins and ends 
 With me 
 One million miles 
 It starts with a step or two 
 What are you waiting for? 
 I'm waiting for you 
 You run the race 
 Thinking you've almost won 
 Then you may find 
 You've only begun 
 You're on the road 
 Thinking you're far from here 
 And suddenly find 
 You're very near 
 What are you waiting for? 
 I'm waiting for you

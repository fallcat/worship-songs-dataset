I really wanna see you 
 I really wanna touch you 
 If only I could hold you in my arms again 
 I really wanna reach you 
 Forever to be with you 
 If only I could hold you in my arms again 
 It was written in the stars 
 On the pages of my heart 
 Oh, that someday I would find 
 The love I feel for you tonight 
 On the ocean of our dreams 
 Like a prayer you came to me 
 And the longing that had been 
 Found its ending in your eyes 
 And I am missing you tonight 
 Across the waves, across the sea 
 Separating you from me 
 Here's a promise and it's mine 
 I will love you for all time 
 I'm wishing you were here tonight

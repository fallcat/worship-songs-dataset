On the stairs she sits and waits 
 She's crying out 
 But nobody even cares 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Holding in the hurt and pain 
 Looking for love 
 To come pull her from this place 
 I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence 
 I'm not gonna walk away in silence 
 Sometimes we're loudest when 
 The doors are shut and no one can see our face 
 No one can see our face 
 But it seems we're quiet when 
 Someone needs a touch of heaven's grace 
 Oh yeah 
 I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence 
 I'm not gonna walk away in silence 
 We are all God's children 
 We need to count off all we've been given 
 Oh yeah 
 We are all God's children 
 We need to count off all we've been given 
 I'm not gonna sit and stay 
 I'm not gonna walk away 
 I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence 
 I'm not gonna walk away in silence 
 Yeah 
 In silence

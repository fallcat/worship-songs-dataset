Jesus is the answer for the world today 
 Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way 
 Jesus is the answer for the world today 
 Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way 
 If you have some questions 
 In the corners of your mind 
 And traces of discouragement 
 And peace you can not find 
 Reflection of the old past 
 They seem to face you every day 
 There's one thing I know for sure 
 That Jesus is the way 
 I know you got mountains 
 That you think you can not climb 
 I know that your skies have been dark 
 You think the sun won't shine 
 In case you don't know it 
 That the World of God is true 
 And everything that He's promised 
 I tell you He would do it for you

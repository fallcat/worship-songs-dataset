Jingle bells, Jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, Hey! 
 Jingle bells, Jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh 
 On Dasher, On Dancer, On Prancer, On Vixen 
 On Comet, On Cupid, On Donner, On Blitzen 
 Put on your bells, your Christmas bells 
 Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride 
 Christmas time is here again 
 Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride 
 To spread good cheer again 
 From the top of the chimney to the top of the wall 
 Dash away, dash away, dash away, all 
 Jingle bells, Jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, Hey! 
 Jingle bells, Jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh 
 Old Saint Nickolas, he took a flight 
 The moon was shining bright 
 Bring out the bells 
 Ol' Saint Nick was riding through the sky 
 You should have seen those reindeer fly 
 Bring out the bells; it's a holiday season 
 Bring out the bells, it's a happy time 
 Bring out the bells, we've got a good reason 
 To ring the bells and hear those pretty bells chime 
 Jingle bells, Jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, Hey! 
 Jingle bells, Jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

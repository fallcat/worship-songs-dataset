Sun comes up, Sunday morn 
 On the little church where I've been since I was born 
 And there he stood, a hearty smile 
 You could hear his voice ringin' out for a country mile 
 And he could place your mind at ease 
 With his tenderness and a heart that aimed to please 
 A papa's hands, a farmer's clothes 
 Just a preacher man we called Kentucky Rose 
 He worked the soul like he worked the land 
 He spoke in ways anyone could understand 
 Simple words of simple faith 
 And when it came to love, he would go out of his way 
 A helping hand, a soothing chat 
 And he practiced what he preached, imagine that 
 And as far as kindess goes 
 There was none compared to old Kentucky Rose 
 Evenings stroll crossed shadows bridge 
 'Cause when he saw the boy tramping on that rocky ridge 
 He knew the danger that he would face 
 It's as if he saved the child only to take his place 
 For on that ridge of stone and ice, 
 Kentucky met his maker in a sacrifice 
 Why he's gone, God only knows 
 Maybe for the company of his Ketucky Rose 
 So peaceful in his Sunday best, 
 He was buried on a hill and laid to rest 
 When people heard, they came in droves 
 To say their last goodbyes to sweet Kentucky Rose 
 Now on that hill one flower rose 
 They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose 
 They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose 
 I believe it is the spirit of Kentucky

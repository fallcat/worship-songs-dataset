Here we are on a boat out on the sea 
 Off the coast of Africa 
 Heading for peaceful shores 
 With a cast of strangers 
 To an island hideaway 
 I hear you telling me 
 Of the place we soon will be 
 A rebirth from life's demise 
 Where the world is still - it's ideal 
 Anything you dream is real 
 It's Hotel Paradise 
 And you say it's nice (when you run to) 
 Lamu - far away 
 Leave the pain far behind you 
 Hoping it won't find you 
 Lamu - far away 
 You say it's there that you can run 
 From the one inside of you 
 So here we are on an island in the sea 
 Near the coast of Africa 
 And when it's right - Lamu nights 
 They can be so inviting 
 Heaven here on earth 
 But here on earth 
 But I hear you telling 
 This is everything you need 
 Well, I don't think it's true 
 Cause the way you feel isn't real 
 You attempt to try and fill 
 The void that's digging through 
 And it's killing you (when you run to) 
 Lamu - far away 
 Tho' that pain was behind you 
 It can even find you in 
 Lamu - far away 
 Because you never can run 
 From the one inside of you

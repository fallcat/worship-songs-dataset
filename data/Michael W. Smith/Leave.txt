Daddy's on the sofa turning up another 
 Bottle to unleash when I get home 
 I pretend he doesn't hit me 
 Momma just pretends that she don't know 
 I used to think of talking, talking to my preacher 
 He says I should just forgive and forget 
 Now my baby brother just sits and recollects the same regret 
 And I just wanna leave 
 Oh, God, please help me now 
 I wanna leave 
 As if that's not enough, we're the new family around here 
 Guess that's all the reason some kids need 
 'Cause they all call me names and 
 Say I should just take it on the chin 
 If I'm overreacting, then why is it so cold here 
 Why is it so cold here in this hell 
 Why would my friend Suzie tell me I should just go kill myself 
 Oh, I wanna get out of here 
 Oh, God, help me now 
 I really wanna believe 
 But I just wanna believe 
 Oh, God, please hear me now 
 I wanna believe 
 I just need to know that you're really out there 
 Tell me, are you really out there 
 'Cause I believe

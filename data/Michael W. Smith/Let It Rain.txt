Let it rain, let it rain. 
 Open the floodgates of Heaven 
 Repeat 
 The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad 
 Let the distance shores rejoice 
 Clouds and thick darkness surround him 
 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne 
 A fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side 
 His lightning lights up the world 
 The earth sees and trembles 
 The mountains melt like wax before the Lord 
 Before the Lord of all the earth 
 The Heavens proclaim His righteousness 
 And all peoples will see His Glory 
 We want to see Your Glory, God! 
 Do you want to see His Glory? 
 Lift your voices, lift your hands! 
 Let it rain, let it rain. 
 Open the floodgates of Heaven 
 Repeat

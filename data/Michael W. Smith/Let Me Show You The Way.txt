I'm looking at you 
 Old friend of mine 
 It's no use pretending 
 That everything's fine 
 So don't be so brave 
 Don't be so proud 
 I want you to know that 
 I'm here for you now 
 I can see you hurting and it's hurting me 
 It doesn't have to be this way 
 If you'd let me hold you 
 Closer 
 Let me know you 
 Let me show you the way 
 (Cantor during chorus) 
 Somebody gonna hold you head up 
 Somebody gonna show you the light 
 Somebody gonna hold you head up 
 Somebody gonna see you right. 
 I'm feeling for you 
 Feeling so much 
 When this heart is big enough 
 For the both of us 
 I'll give you my love 
 If you give me your pain 
 I'll hold it inside of me 
 Till you're stronger again 
 Well I hate seeing you so far away 
 When not a word can say enough 
 CHORUS w/ cantor 
 I'll be your rock for this day 
 When I hear you calling out my name 
 'Cause I know you'd only do the same for me 
 Somebody gonna hold your head up 
 Somebody gonna show you the light 
 Somebody gonna hold your head up 
 Somebody gonna see you right

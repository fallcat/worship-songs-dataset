Never should have tasted that forbidden fruit 
 Tell my why do I always do 
 What I don't want to do 
 Now, I'm the only reaper of the seeds that I sow 
 And when I walk the field of my stubborn will 
 It's a hard row to hoe 
 There's a price for getting smarter 
 So I pay what I owe 
 While bridges burn 
 Let the shadow fall behind me 
 I am wiser I know 
 We live and learn 
 Always living and learning 
 Always living and learning 
 Is it out of the fire, back into the pan 
 Is once enough to let it all sink in, or will I do it again 
 A time for understanding has now come of age 
 So I heed the word of the counselor and the voice of the sage 
 Try to see the meaning 
 Read between every line 
 When pages turn 
 There'll be no room for explaining what has been well-defined 
 We live and learn 
 Always living and learning 
 Always living and learning 
 And engaging temptation had me doing time 
 'Cause when it starts a fire under strong desire 
 We are partners in crime 
 But hindsight is clearer 
 I can see where I've gone and never return 
 It's a new man in the mirror 
 It's a new freedom song to live and learn 
 Always living and learning 
 Always living and learning

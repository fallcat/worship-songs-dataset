You painted me a picture of tomorrow 
 A place where you and I walked hand in hand 
 A world without despair and without shadows 
 But things just didn't turn out how we'd planned 
 Now you're gone 
 And I believe that there is somewhere 
 Where the anels fill the sky 
 And I believe we'll live forever 
 You and I, you and I 
 Will never die 
 I wonder if you knew that you were leaving 
 I thought that I saw something in your eyes 
 You painted me a picture of believing 
 I'll see you there on the other side 
 And I'll be there

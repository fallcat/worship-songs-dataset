There's something in my head 
 She turned to me and said 
 There's a world I'm so scared to show you 
 I just don't have the words 
 I don't want to be hurt 
 See the mountain but I just can't move 
 I said it would be a shame 
 To leave from this place 
 Without a sound 
 I want to know who you are 
 Just let down your guard right now 
 Oh, you got to let it out 
 Oh, play your symphony, let me hear it 
 No one else can say the words inside your head 
 I don't know what you're waiting for 
 Play your symphony, let me hear it 
 Keep on saying the words inside your head 
 Louder! 
 You're born a Child of God 
 Don't let the truth get lost 
 Lost beyond the fear of the moment 
 There's a reason why 
 You hear those dreams inside 
 Calling up from under the ocean 
 You know it would be a shame 
 To leave from this place 
 Without a sound 
 I want to know who you are 
 Just let down your guard right now 
 Oh you got to let it ou-ou-ou-ou-out 
 Oh, play your symphony, let me hear it 
 No one else can say the words inside your head 
 I don't know what you're waiting for 
 Play your symphony, let me hear it 
 Keep on saying the words inside your head 
 Louder! 
 Play your symphony, let me hear it 
 No one else can say the words inside your head 
 I don't know what you're waiting for 
 Play your symphony, let me hear it 
 Keep on saying the words inside your head 
 I don't know what you're waiting for 
 Play your symphony, let me hear it 
 Keep on saying the words inside your head 
 Louder!

I know You're listening from the other side 
 So here I come, no longer will I hide 
 Your guns are pointed straight at me 
 Love always wins 
 I had it all but I burned it down 
 If we don't get lost then we don't get found 
 We all have violence hiding deep within 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 I need to hear it time and time again 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 It's written and it's always been 
 Love always wins 
 I cannot see You but I know You're near 
 No need to hide, no need to fear 
 You know the light's gonna find us 
 Love always wins 
 I'll show You all my sorrow, all my pain 
 When I'm stronger thinking all will change, and when I'm weak 
 I doubt it and suddenly 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 I need to hear it time and time again 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 It's written and it's always been 
 Love always wins 
 You say, there is a distance 
 You say, the space is much too wide 
 I say, with no resistance 
 I'm going to find You 
 Love always wins 
 I'm going to find You 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 I need to hear it time and time again 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 It's written and it's always been 
 Love always wins 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 I need to hear it time and time again 
 Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh 
 It's written and it's always been 
 Love always wins

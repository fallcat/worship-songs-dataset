I had a dream that I was speaking 
 With a prophet from the land of wise 
 In a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts 
 I said, "We've come here for answers 
 A solution to our world's demise" 
 He said the journey would be long 
 But here is where you start 
 Love one another 
 Love one another 
 Work it in to work it out 
 There can never be enough 
 Love one another 
 Love one another 
 'Cause you know without a doubt 
 You can change your world with love 
 It was a simple conclusion 
 But I thought that it was rather profound 
 Just a fundemental law that we should all live by 
 I took it in to tomorrow 
 Yeah, I walked the earth but I never found 
 Any corner of the world 
 Where this did not apply 
 Love one another 
 Love one another 
 Work it in to work it out 
 There can never be enough 
 Love one another 
 Love one another 
 'Cause you know without a doubt 
 You can change your world with love 
 And looking out I saw no method to the madness there 
 Like in a vision from the Isle of Patmos 
 I was scared 
 It was a revelation 
 Love is getting rare 
 The people of the land united 
 And in my dream, we all agreed 
 That we should start again 
 And this would be our creed... 
 Love one another 
 Love one another 
 Work it in to work it out 
 There can never be enough 
 Love one another 
 Love one another 
 'Cause you know without a doubt 
 You can change your world with love

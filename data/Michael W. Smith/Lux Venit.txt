 Lux venit lux venit 
 Lux venit sursum corda 
 Lux venit lux venit arise 
 Shine for your light has come 
 By sword by flame 
 In death solemn ages passed 
 And voices young 
 Grow old weary 
 Holding fast 
 Hope for the dawning 
 Lux venit lux venit 
 Lux venit sursum corda 
 Lux venit lux venit arise 
 Shine for your light has come 
 In grace in might 
 The babe lay in stable stark 
 Redemptions's light 
 Pierces through the shadows dark 
 Alleluia 
 Lux venit lux venit 
 Sursum corda 
 Lux venit lux venit arise 
 Shine for your light has come 
 Lux venit lux venit 
 Lux venit sursum corda 
 Lux venit lux venit arise 
 Shine for your light has come 
 Alleluia 
 Lux venit: "The light has come" 
 Sursum corda: "look upwards hearts"

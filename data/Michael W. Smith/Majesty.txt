Singin' Majesty, Majesty 
 Your grace has found me just as I am 
 Empty handed but alive in Your hands 
 We're singing Majesty, we're singing Majesty 
 Forever, forever I am changed by Your love 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 We're singing Majesty, Majesty 
 Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am 
 Empty handed but alive in Your hands 
 We're singing Majesty, we're singing Majesty 
 Forever I am changed by Your love 
 In the presence of Your Majesty, Majesty 
 Majesty, Majesty 
 Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am 
 Empty handed but alive in Your hands 
 Majesty, Majesty 
 Forever I am changed by Your love 
 In the presence of Your Majesty 
 We praise You, oh God, lift up a new song 
 Oh we praise You, Lord, We praise Your name 
 You are the Father, You are the Father 
 Oh, we love You, we love You, we love You, oh oh 
 Oh, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

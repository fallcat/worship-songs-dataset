Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Would one day walk on water? 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Would save our sons and daughters? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Has come to make you new? 
 This child that you deliver 
 Will soon deliver you 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Would give sight to a blind man? 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Would calm a storm with His hands? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Has walked where angels trod? 
 And when you kissed your little baby 
 You kissed the face of God 
 Oh, Mary, did you know? 
 Mary, did you know? 
 The blind will see, the deaf will hear 
 The dead will live again 
 The meek will lead, the dumb will speak 
 The praises of a man 
 Oh, Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Was Lord of all creation? 
 Mary, did you know that your baby boy 
 Would one day rule the nations? 
 Did you know that your baby boy 
 Was Heaven's perfect lamb? 
 That the sleeping child you're holding 
 Is the great I Am? 
 Oh Mary, oh

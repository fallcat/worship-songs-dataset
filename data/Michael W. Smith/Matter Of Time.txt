If I could I would tell you why 
 The first time I saw her I could touch the sky 
 I turned to stone... and I could not speak 
 She had the ability to make me weak 
 Always wishing... always hoping 
 That she'll get the message from the 
 Bottom of my heart 
 Let's together... share forever 
 It's just a matter of time 
 I had to wait and just let her breathe 
 That's never been easy for a man to see 
 She moved slow... and she took her time 
 She kept me guessing what was on her mind 
 It's just a matter of time 
 Let's forever... be together 
 It's just a matter of time 
 It's just a matter of time

Sing we now of Christmas 
 Sing we all Noel 
 Of the Lord and Savior 
 We the tidings tell 
 Sing we Noel 
 For Christ the King is born 
 Sing we Noel 
 For Christ the Lord is born 
 Angels from on high 
 May shepherds come and see 
 He's born in Bethlehem 
 A blessed family 
 Glory to God 
 For Christ our King is born 
 Glory to God 
 For Christ our Lord is born 
 Sing we now of Christmas 
 Sing we all Noel 
 Sing we now of Christmas 
 Sing we all Noel 
 Sing we all Noel 
 Sing we all Noel

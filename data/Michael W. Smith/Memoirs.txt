Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the feast of Stephen. 
 When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even. 
 Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel, 
 When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel. 
 Hither page and stand by me if thou know'st it telling 
 Yonder peasant, who is he, where and what his dwelling? 
 Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain, 
 Right against the forest fence, by Saint Agnes' fountain. 
 Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither 
 Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither 
 Page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together 
 Through the rude winds wild lament, and the bitter weather. 
 Sire the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger 
 Fails my heart, I know not how, I can go no longer. 
 Mark my footsteps my good page, tread thou in them boldly 
 Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly. 
 In his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dinted 
 Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed 
 Therefore Christian men be sure, wealth or rank possessing, 
 Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing.

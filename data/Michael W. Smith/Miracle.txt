A rebel heart 
 A restless soul 
 I lost my sight 
 I lost control 
 A cry for hope 
 Could I be saved 
 You found a way 
 You found a way 
 Your miracle is burning bright in me 
 I was a slave, and now I'm free 
 I'm lifting high these broken chains 
 You always find a way 
 I am a miracle 
 I am a miracle 
 Impossible 
 The war was lost 
 Before Your blood 
 Before the cross 
 My shame no more 
 My curse no more 
 You made a way, yeah 
 You made a way oh oh oh oh 
 Your miracle is burning bright in me 
 I was a slave, and now I'm free 
 I'm lifting high these broken chains 
 You always find a way 
 I am a miracle 
 I am a miracle 
 Amazing grace 
 How sweet the sound 
 I once was lost 
 But now I'm found 
 Amazing grace 
 How sweet the sound 
 I once was lost 
 But now I'm found 
 Your miracle is burning bright in me 
 I was a slave, and now I'm free 
 I'm lifting high these broken chains 
 You always find a way 
 I am a miracle 
 I am a miracle 
 I am a miracle

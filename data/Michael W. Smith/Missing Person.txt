Another question in me 
 One for the powers that be 
 It's got me thrown 
 And so I put on my poker face 
 And try to figure it out 
 This undeniable doubt 
 A common occurrence 
 Feeling so out of place 
 Guarded and cynical now 
 Can't help but wondering how 
 My heart evolved into 
 A rock beating inside of me 
 So I feel such a stoic ordeal 
 Where's that feeling that I don't feel 
 There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain 
 And like a child he would believe without a reason 
 Without a trace he disappeared into the void and 
 I've been searchin' for that missing person 
 Under a lavender moon 
 So many thoughts consume me 
 Who dimmed that glowing light 
 That once burned so bright in me 
 Is this a radical phase 
 A problematical age 
 That keeps me running 
 From all that I used to be 
 Is there a way to return 
 Is there a way to unlearn 
 That carnal knowledge 
 That's chipping away at my soul 
 I've been gone too long 
 Will I ever find my way home? 
 There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain 
 And like a child he would believe without a reason 
 Without a trace he disappeared into the void and 
 I've been searchin' for that missing person 
 He used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow 
 He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow 
 It's been a long time and I haven't seen him lately 
 But I've been searchin' for that missing person 
 For that missing person 
 For that missing person, oh, oh, oh... 
 There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain 
 And like a child he would believe without a reason 
 Without a trace he disappeared into the void and 
 I've been searchin' 
 He used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow 
 He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow 
 It's been a long time and I haven't seen him lately 
 But I've been searchin' for that missing person 
 Oh, where are you, where are you, oh 
 I've been searchin' for that person 
 Where are you, oh

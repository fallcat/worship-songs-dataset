I have been unfaithful 
 I have been unworthy 
 I have been unrighteous 
 And I have been unmerciful 
 I have been unreachable 
 I have been unteachable 
 I have been unwilling 
 And I've been undesirable 
 And sometimes I have been unwise 
 I've been undone by what I'm unsure of 
 But because of You 
 And all that You went through 
 I know that I have never been unloved 
 I have been unbroken 
 I have been unmended 
 I have been uneasy 
 And I've been unapproachable 
 I've been unemotional 
 I've been unexceptional 
 I've been undecided 
 And I have been unqualified 
 Unaware, I have been unfair 
 I've been unfit for blessings from above 
 But even I can see 
 The sacrifice You made for me 
 To show that I have never been unloved 
 Unaware, I have been unfair 
 I've been unfit for blessings from above 
 But even I can see 
 The sacrifice You made for me 
 To show that I have never been unloved 
 It's because of You 
 And all that You went through 
 I know that I have never been unloved 
 I have been unfaithful 
 I have been unavailable 
 I have never been unloveable

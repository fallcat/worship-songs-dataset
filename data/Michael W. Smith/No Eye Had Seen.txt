No eye had seen 
 No ear had heard 
 'Til host on high 
 Proclaimed the birth 
 And heav'n brought down 
 Its only child 
 The Son of Man the world reconciled 
 Quietly with no one watching 
 From the womb of perfect peace 
 Wellspring of our joy delivered Into earthly destiny 
 And song broke forth 
 Angelic strain 
 And none could help 
 But sing the name 
 Emmanuel Emmanuel 
 Emmanuel Emmanuel 
 Kyrie eleison we sing 
 Glory to the newborn King 
 Mortal and immortal voices 
 Endless praises echoing

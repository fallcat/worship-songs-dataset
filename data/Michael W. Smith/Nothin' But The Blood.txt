 What can wash away my sins 
 (There's) Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can make me whole again 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 This is all my righteousness 
 It's nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 This is all my hope and peace 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus

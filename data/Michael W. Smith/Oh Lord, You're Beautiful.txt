Oh Lord, you're beautiful 
 Your face is all I see 
 For when your eyes are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 Yeah yeah 
 Oh Lord you're beautiful 
 Your face is all I seek 
 For when your eyes are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 For when your eyes are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 Oh Lord

 Yes you are 
 Oh Lord

In the passion your heart is abused 
 He is pushing you, you have to choose 
 Oh, Rebecca, love is never 
 Easy anymore 
 Oh, Rebecca, so afraid of 
 Losing what is yours 
 Are you giving in to the pressure 
 Holding you again, now he tells you 
 What it takes to be in love 
 He believes you're old enough 
 But how you gonna feel tomorrow 
 When the day reveals 
 What you believed was for the sake of love 
 Don't you think you're old enough to know 
 You're a breed of few and far between 
 Holding on to your romantic dream 
 Oh, Rebecca, love is patient 
 Love would understand 
 Oh, Rebecca, your decision 
 Is your only chance 
 Oh, Rebecca don't confuse what love is 
 With what some say love should be 
 Should be...

I'm not how I used to be 
 When we hung around 
 Back when it was you and me 
 Tearin' up this town 
 We used to live our lives running from change 
 Now we don't see eye to eye 
 I am not the same 
 And you wonder where I've gone 
 Well, I've found where I belong 
 I'm on the other side 
 True - I used to walk your shore 
 But I'm not there anymore 
 I'm on the other side 
 Years fade like the setting sun 
 Turning us loose 
 They give us many ways to run 
 And many roads to choose 
 Well, I ran into saving grace 
 Headed for nowhere 
 Love showed me another place 
 And brought me there 
 Why is it hard for you to see 
 All the changes made in me 
 Here on the other side 
 Oh, I could help you understand 
 And you could join me where I am 
 I am on the other side

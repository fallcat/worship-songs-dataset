There always seems to be a door that you can't open 
 There always seems to be a mountain you can't climb 
 But you keep on reaching 
 You just keep on reaching 
 When your destiny is out there in the distance 
 But the road ahead's a mine field in disguise 
 And you keep on moving 
 You just keep on moving 
 You will make it through this 
 Just give it time 
 You gotta give it time 
 This is what you're made for 
 Standing in the downpour 
 Knowing that the sun will shine 
 Forget what lies behind you 
 Heaven walks beside you 
 You got to give it one more try 
 One more time 
 You just keep on reaching 
 You just keep on, you keep on moving 
 When the shadows fall on everything you're dreaming 
 When the promises turn out to be a lie 
 You just keep believing 
 You just keep believing 
 Oh, don't stop your dreaming 
 It's gonna be all right 
 It's gonna be all right 
 You've got to keep on reaching 
 Keep believing 
 It's gonna be all right

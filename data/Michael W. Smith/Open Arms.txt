Many people in the steeple 
 But no one leaves the walls 
 Quick to stand and speak 
 All of their beliefs 
 Quick to leave you if you fall 
 Tell me where's the love 
 It knows no boundaries 
 Tell me where's the love 
 Yeah yeah 
 Open arms 
 We need to be 
 Open arms 
 Never judge you 
 Always loving 
 Needs to be what we become 
 Lifting up the lost 
 Showing them the cross 
 Shining brightly like the sun 
 Tell me where's the love 
 It knows no boundaries 
 Tell me where's the love 
 Yeah yeah 
 Open arms 
 We need to be 
 Open arms 
 Yeah 
 Tell me where's the love 
 That knows no boundaries 
 Tell me where's the love 
 Yeah yeah 
 Open arms 
 We need to be 
 Open arms 
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Everybody sing 
 (Buncha these) 
 Open arms 
 We need to be open arms 
 And the whole world sing 
 Na na na na [Buncha these] 
 Open arms

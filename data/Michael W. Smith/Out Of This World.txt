1st Verse: 
 Take stock of your life 
 What's wrong and what's right 
 Empty pockets, got no green 
 Don't you know sunshine is free 
 What breaks have you had 
 Some good and some bad 
 Wanna go but got no car 
 Dreaming dreams can take you far 
 You will find that life's worth living 
 In this world, it's out of this world 
 With a little love and a little giving 
 In this world, it's out of this world 
 2nd Verse: 
 Look to the future 
 Who's in the picture 
 Say your love life's just a dream 
 Still you've got a friend in me 
 Today, tomorrow 
 Laughter and sorrow 
 Gonna be some lows and highs 
 Might as well enjoy the ride 
 Rap: 
 It's all in your point of view 
 A different look will see you through 
 So check it out 
 'Cause life's worth living 
 In this world, it's out of this world

Sing choirs of angels 
 Sing in exultation 
 O sing all ye citizens of heav'n above 
 Glory to God 
 Glory in the highest 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord 
 Yea Lord we greet Thee 
 Born this happy morning 
 Jesus to Thee be all glory giv'n 
 Word of the Father 
 Now in flesh appearing 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 Christ the Lord

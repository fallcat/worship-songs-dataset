Pull all your hair up 
 Dab on the make up 
 Tryin' hard to look so pristine 
 Like a face in a magazine 
 Those fancy dressers 
 Media pressure 
 Got you feelin' so plain and small 
 If you don't look like a paper doll 
 In a world where the goal is 
 To be like the Jones' 
 It's guaranteed to drive you wild 
 Keepin' up with the latest style 
 Gaze in the mirror 
 You want the glamor 
 And the grace of a movie star 
 But I like you the way you are 
 You are the only one I'm dreamin' of 
 'Cause baby don't you know that I love 
 You, girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To be in my world 
 Girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To fit the frame 
 You're tender, you're tactful 
 Girl, you're a natural 
 You possess a heart that's true 
 That's what I like about you 
 One in a million 
 Yeah, that's a given 
 There's a beauty inside of you 
 And it shows on the outside too 
 No competition, you're way in the lead 
 And baby, don't you know that I need 
 You, girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To be in my world 
 Girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To be in my world 
 Girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To fit the frame 
 You are the only one I'm dreamin' of 
 'Cause baby don't you know that I love 
 You, girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To be in my world 
 Girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To be in my world 
 Girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 In my world 
 Girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To fit the frame 
 Girl, girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To be in my world 
 Girl, girl 
 You don't have to be picture perfect 
 To be in my world 
 Girl, girl

The wind is moving 
 But I am standing still 
 A life of pages 
 Waiting to be filled 
 A heart that's hopeful 
 A head that's full of dreams 
 But this becoming 
 Is harder than it seems 
 Feels like I'm 
 Looking for a reason 
 Roamin' through the night to find 
 My place in this world 
 My place in this world 
 Not a lot to lean on 
 I need your light to help me find 
 My place in this world 
 My place in this world 
 If there are millions 
 Down on their knees 
 Among the many 
 Can you still hear me 
 Hear me asking 
 Where do I belong? 
 Is there a vision 
 That I can call my own? 
 Show me, I'm 
 Looking for a reason 
 Roamin' through the night to find 
 My place in this world 
 My place in this world 
 Not a lot to lean on 
 I need your light to help me find 
 My place in this world 
 My place in this world 
 Lookin' for a reason 
 Roamin' through the night to find 
 My place in this world 
 My place in this world 
 Not a lot to lean on 
 I need your light to help me find 
 My place in this world 
 My place in this world 
 Lookin' for a reason 
 Roamin' through the night to find 
 My place in this world 
 My place in this world

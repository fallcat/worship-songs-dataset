Here is where the road divides 
 Here is where we realize 
 The sculpting of the Father's great design 
 Through time you've been a friend to me 
 But time is now the enemy 
 I wish we didn't have to say goodbye 
 But I know the road he chose for me 
 Is not the road he chose for you 
 So as we chase the dreams we're after 
 Pray for me and I'll pray for you 
 Pray that we will keep the common ground 
 Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you 
 And one day love will bring us back around 
 Again 
 Painted on a tapestry 
 We see the way it has to be 
 Weaving through the laughter and the tears 
 But love will be the tie that binds us 
 To the time we leave behind us 
 Memories will be our souvenirs 
 And I know that through it all 
 The hardest part of love is letting go 
 But there's a greater love that holds us 
 Pray for me and I'll pray for you 
 Pray that we will keep the common ground 
 Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you 
 And one day love will bring us back around 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you 
 Pray that we will keep the common ground 
 Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you 
 And one day love will bring us back around 
 Oh, I know that love will bring us back around 
 Again

Where the angels see 
 You are praised as You should be. 
 But how can I express 
 My yearning for Your Holiness. 
 May it be (that) 
 I will open my heart 
 Search me in the deepest part. 
 And I will stand in cleansing fire, 
 By You, purified, 
 By You I'm purified. 
 Savior of my soul 
 To your strength I yield control. 
 Purge me of my stain 
 Sin will lose it's mortal reign. 
 Make me free (and) 
 I will open my heart 
 Search me in the deepest part. 
 And I will stand in cleansing fire, 
 By You, purified, 
 By You I'm purified. 
 You are Holy 
 You are Holy 
 Yes You are Holy 
 You are Holy 
 You are Holy 
 Holy 
 I will open my heart 
 Search me in the deepest part. 
 And I will stand in cleansing fire, 
 By You, purified, 
 By You I'm purified. 
 You are Holy 
 You are Holy 
 Yes You are Holy 
 You are Holy 
 You are Holy 
 Holy

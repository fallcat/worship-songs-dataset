Wake up and dream about 
 The plans you have in store for you 
 But keep in mind 
 It's not just what you do 
 But what you do it for and who 
 There are roads to discover 
 There are stories yet to be told 
 As you see the big picture 
 Just beginning to unfold, so 
 Break down the barriers but 
 Don't bend the rules 
 Never forget your roots 
 As you head for something new 
 Ride through the shades of desire 
 Letting the light be seen 
 And he'll steer the heart in the 
 Pursuit of the dream 
 It's alright to find yourself 
 Thinking now and then 
 About the way you want your life to be 
 Anticipating what lies 
 Just around the bend 
 Can't wait to see 
 Comes the times of decision 
 Some you dodge and some you should face 
 As you see the big picture 
 There will be some dues to pay, so 
 Break down the barriers but 
 Don't bend the rules 
 Never forget your roots 
 As you head for something new 
 Ride through the shades of desire 
 Letting the light be seen 
 And he'll steer the heart in the 
 Pursuit of the dream 
 Wake up and dream about 
 The plans you have in store for you 
 But keep in mind it's not just what you do 
 But what you do it for and who 
 There are choices that build you 
 Choices that will make you fall 
 All part of the big picture 
 One day you will see it all

Sometimes the journey makes you weary 
 Feels like a long and winding road 
 Sometimes this life can lose its meaning 
 But you might be surprised to find some hope 
 Maybe you're wondering where love is 
 You may feel it's far away from here 
 Maybe you're wondering where I am 
 You might be surprised to find I'm near 
 And when your life is tossed and turning 
 And you are on the raging sea 
 I'll come and pull you from the water 
 Then you will know that you are free 
 So if you're stumbling through the valley 
 Or if you're tempted to give up the fight 
 Reach out your hand and I will lead you 
 I will be your strong arm in the night 
 And when your life is tossed and turning 
 And you are on the raging sea 
 I'll come and pull you from the water 
 Then you will know that you are free, yeah 
 And when your life is tossed and turning 
 And you are on the raging sea, woa 
 I'll come and pull you from the water 
 Then you will know that you are free, yeah 
 I'll come and pull you from the water 
 Then you will know that you are free

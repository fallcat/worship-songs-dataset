Another million miles from the truth now 
 I know there's peace but I can't 
 Figure out how 
 To stop this race that's taking over me 
 I'm under the gun I wait for you to see 
 Oh, please reach out to me 
 Open my eyes to see 
 I'm running from you now 
 Come rescue me somehow 
 Another scar from fighting the truth now 
 Has left me like a stranger to my need now 
 A masquerade, a game to figure out now 
 A cruel charade I cannot scream aloud 
 A narrow stretch of road in the way now 
 A heavy load still hanging on to me now 
 I'm in a maze that I can't seem to get out 
 Without a view from these shoulders of doubt

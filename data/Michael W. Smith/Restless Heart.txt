On the street it never changes 
 There's a chill in the air 
 Icy people, empty faces 
 Not a word, not a soul who cares 
 Do you give up? 
 Have you given in to the lie that a heart never changes? 
 Don't be fooled by what you see there 
 Another man with another case of 
 One restless heart, who never could find love 
 Too many hurts to reach out again 
 How can he know? Love still wants to find him 
 One restless shell of a man 
 In a moment his life could be new 
 Just a moment and love could break through 
 Oh finally some place to start 
 For a man with a restless heart 
 Why the fear then, why the worry 
 Why the walls holding love inside? 
 When you're needed in the fury 
 In the fighting to save men's lives 
 Don't you give up? 
 Don't be giving in to the lie that a heart never changes 
 If you reach out God'll reach in 
 Bring an end to another case of 
 One restless heart, who never could find love 
 Too many hurts to reach out again 
 How can he know? Love still wants to find him 
 One restless shell of a man 
 In a moment his life could be new 
 Just a moment and love could break through 
 Oh finally some place to start 
 For a man with a restless heart 
 One restless heart, one restless heart 
 One restless heart, one restless heart 
 He's got to know that love still can find him 
 Love can reach any man, don't look away 
 In a moment his life could be new 
 Just a moment and love could break through 
 Oh finally some place to start 
 For a man with a restless heart 
 Oh never a stranger again 
 Love has saved a restless man 
 Finally some place to start 
 For a man with a restless heart 
 Oh yeah 
 Our love has saved a restless man 
 Finally some place to start 
 For a man with a restless heart

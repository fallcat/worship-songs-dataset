Walk across the shore 
 Walk across the sea 
 Stand upon the waves 
 And walk with me 
 Journey through the door 
 Come see what I can see 
 All the reasons we were made 
 Who we were meant to be 
 Rise, He's calling you to go 
 Just leave it all behind 
 And rise above 
 Beyond the obvious 
 And what you can attain 
 Past the here and now 
 Where faith remains 
 Lift your weary head 
 There's too much left to lose 
 More than you can imagine 
 It's waiting there for you 
 Rise, He's calling you to come 
 Just leave it all behind 
 And rise above 
 Come and stand 
 And join with me as one 
 Now take my hand and we 
 Will rise above 
 (Yeah) (ooh, oh) (yeah) (ooh, oh) (yeah) (ooh, oh) 
 Rise, He's calling you to come 
 Just leave it all behind 
 And rise above 
 Come and stand 
 And join with me as one 
 Now take my hand and we 
 Will rise above 
 (Ooh, oh) (ooh, oh) (ooh, oh) 
 Come stand with me 
 (Ooh oh) (ooh, oh) (ooh, oh) 
 Come stand with me

A Friday night affair 
 Out in the city heat 
 Always a party there 
 Along the sordid street 
 And it was guaranteed 
 The place to be was Rocketown 
 The drinks were two for one 
 Inside the crowded bars 
 The girls would make their run 
 Down on the boulevard 
 It was the idol place 
 We lived the ways of Rocketown 
 Hang around by the street light 
 In the heart of the night life 
 There came a certain man 
 A stranger to the crowd 
 We didn't understand 
 What he was all about 
 He walked a different pace 
 So out of place in Rocketown 
 They made a fool of him 
 They teased him when he's speak 
 But when they knocked him down 
 He turned the other cheek 
 He told me I could find 
 A life outside of Rocketown 
 Hang around by the street light 
 In the heart of the night life 
 What was his mission 
 Where was he going 
 Why was his heart light always glowing 
 All I was missing 
 He stood there holding 
 What was his secret 
 Could I know it 
 Some didn't like him near 
 Some laughed and turned away 
 But me, I longed to hear 
 All that he had to say 
 He had a peace of mind 
 I couldn't find in Rocketown 
 And when I reached down inside me 
 I could feel the emptiness 
 He said it's in the heart 
 This change that comes to be 
 Now he had done his part 
 The choice was up to me 
 As we were standing there 
 He said a prayer for Rocketown 
 As we were standing there 
 He said a prayer for Rocketown 
 He walked off silently 
 And prayed for me 
 And Rocketown...

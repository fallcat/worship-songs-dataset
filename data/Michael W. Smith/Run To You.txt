Control, I give up control, I can't carry this alone 
 I've tried for so long, I've tried to make it on my own 
 Now dreams are scattered on the ground 
 And now I'm on my knees 
 I, I can't help myself, I can't help myself 
 I'm gonna run to You 
 I, I can't help myself, I can't help myself 
 I'm gonna run to You, run to You 
 Weak, there are times I'm weak 
 If my scars could speak they'd say that grace is my only hope 
 Grace is showing me the way to where all my shadows disappear 
 And healing waits for me 
 I, I can't help myself, I can't help myself 
 I'm gonna run to You 
 I, I can't help myself, I can't help myself 
 I'm gonna run to You, run to You 
 What kind of love is this? Lifts me up and draws me in 
 Tonight, I'm just a heart running back home 
 When everything is pushed aside, all my plans and all my pride 
 Tonight, I'm just a heart coming back home 
 I can't help myself 
 I'm gonna run to You 
 I, I can't help myself, I can't help myself 
 I'm gonna run to You, run to You 
 I'm gonna run to You

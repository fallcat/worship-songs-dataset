Lost 
 My heart is hard as stone 
 On my own, alone, I carry it home 
 Gone 
 I used to waste the days, 
 So distraught, I thought, I'm changing my ways 
 Now you're changing my ways 
 You save me 
 Save me from myself 
 There is no one else 
 I'd lean on 
 Save me 
 You save me from myself 
 There is no one else that sets me free 
 Start 
 The start of something new 
 Is what I find, when I'm just looking at you. 
 Lift 
 You lift me off the ground, 
 Keep holding my hand 
 I won't bend or even look down 
 Don't look down! 
 Don't look down! 
 You save me 
 Save me from myself 
 There is no one else 
 I'd lean on 
 Save me 
 You save me from myself 
 There is no one else that sets me free 
 Bridge (Music) 
 You save me 
 Save me from myself 
 There is no one else 
 I'd lean on 
 Save me 
 You save me from myself 
 There is no one else that sets me free

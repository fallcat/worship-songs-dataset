Young man, up on the hillside 
 Teaching new ways 
 Each word, winning them over 
 Each heart a kindled flame 
 Old men, watch from the outside 
 Guarding their prey 
 Threated by the voice of a paragon 
 Leading their lambs away 
 Leading them far away 
 Nobody knew His secret ambition 
 Nobody knew His claim to fame 
 He broke the old rules steeped in tradition 
 He tore the holy veil away 
 Questioning those in powerful positions 
 Running to those who called His name 
 But nobody knew His secret ambition 
 Was to give His life away 
 His rage, shaking the temple 
 His word to the wise 
 His hand, healing on the seventh day 
 His love wearing no disguise 
 Some say, death to the radical 
 He's way out of line 
 Some say, praised be the miracle 
 God sends a blessed sign 
 A blessed sign for troubled times 
 Nobody knew His secret ambition 
 Nobody knew His claim to fame 
 He broke the old rules steeped in tradition 
 He tore the holy veil away 
 Questioning those in powerful positions 
 Running to those who called His name 
 But nobody knew His secret ambition 
 Was to give His life away... 
 Oh... Oh... Oh... 
 Nobody knew His secret ambition 
 Nobody knew His claim to fame 
 He broke the old rules steeped in tradition 
 He tore the holy veil away 
 Questioning those in powerful positions 
 Running to those who called His name 
 But nobody knew His secret ambition 
 Was to give His life away 
 Ooh... 
 No, no, no, no 
 I tell you nobody knew 
 Until He gave His life away 
 No!

(Chorus in Lugandan) 
 Kimu nkimaanyi 
 Buli muntu alina ensiigo 
 Omutima gwo gukulung 'aamye 
 Buli muntu alina ensiigo 
 Some people quietly reveal 
 In the manner of the meek 
 Some people shout the way they feel 
 To a radical degree 
 Some people sing it to express 
 While others hear another call 
 Some people speak with subtleness 
 Some don't rely on words at all 
 But let me tell you 'bout... 
 One thing I know 
 Everybody's got a seed to sow 
 Let your heart of hearts 
 Take you down the road 
 Everybody's got a seed to sow 
 We all are pieces of the whole 
 With different feelings to evoke 
 Giving distinction to the role 
 Different players-different strokes 
 But let me tell you 'bout... 
 Some people walk 
 Some people race 
 Some people vary in their pace 
 But God can use what you can give 
 Within the mystery of His ways 
 Don't underestimate... 
 Kimu nkimaanyi 
 Buli muntu alina ensiigo 
 Omutima gwo 
 Gukulung 'aamye 
 Buli muntu alina ensiigo

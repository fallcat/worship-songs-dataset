From the first breath of her life 
 She flew straight into my arms 
 I used to catch her from the swing 
 When she was five... 
 And now she dances on the wind 
 In a world as hard as stone 
 She's so anxious to begin 
 And ready to fly... 
 And she walks with me 
 And she talks with me 
 And I hold her hand in mine 
 I know she'll find her way 
 Like the light of day 
 'Cause it's love that makes her strong 
 Though I cannot stop the rain 
 And I cannot turn the tide 
 And I am sure there will be things 
 That break her heart 
 I can only let her know 
 I am always on her side 
 And even as I let her go 
 I'll never be far 
 And she walks with me 
 And she talks with me 
 And I hold her hand in mine 
 I know she'll find her way 
 Like the light of day 
 'Cause it's love that makes her strong 
 And she walks with me 
 And she talks with me 
 In my eyes she'll see my prayer 
 As she turns each page 
 Through this tender age 
 It is love that makes her strong 
 It's her love that makes her strong

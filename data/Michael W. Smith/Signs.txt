You're wieghed down with regret 
 You can't see the road ahead 
 Or the burden on your back 
 It seems the trek will never end 
 The winding paths that still descend 
 And up above a sky washed black 
 You just can't bear to look at that 
 Follow the signs 
 Open your eyes 
 Read between the lines of what you see 
 Look into the soul of reality 
 Open your mind 
 Look at the signs 
 Never look back at yesterday 
 Keep your gaze steady on the narrow way 
 Now you've found the sacred tree 
 You kneel upon the broken wheat 
 You watch your burden fall away 
 And all the things you once sought 
 Now are counted less than lost 
 For now you see the light of day 
 The signs were pointing all the way 
 Follow the signs 
 Follow the signs 
 Open your eyes 
 Look at the signs 
 Open your mind 
 Follow the signs

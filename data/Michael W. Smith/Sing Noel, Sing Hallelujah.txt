This is a song I learned at my school and I'm just 
 Letting you know we adore it and its just beautiful for people to 
 Hear and sing it. 
 Come, behold this child in a manger 
 Gift of the father's great love 
 Angels look down as His glory sorrounds them 
 Starlight from Heaven above 
 Sing Noel, Sing Hallelujah 
 God in us now come to dwell 
 Sing Noel lift high His praises 
 Christ our Emmanuel 
 Christ our Emmanuel 
 Let every daughter and son of the Father 
 Rise on this Christmas night 
 Let every voice sing all praise and rejoicing 
 Christ our redeemer is born

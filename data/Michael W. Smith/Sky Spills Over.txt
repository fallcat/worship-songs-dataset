There's a rose in the desert 
 Blooming red in the drought 
 There's a quenching rain 
 In the wings of the gathering clouds 
 Lift your eyes 
 Look to the horizon now 
 There's still a hope for us 
 Reach up from the dust 
 And call it down 
 Can you hear 
 Can you hear that thunder 
 Sing His name, sing it out 
 'Til the sky spills over 
 I may just be dry bones 
 Stripped of sinew and skin 
 But the wind of His spirit 
 Will raise me up again 
 I lift my eyes 
 I look to the horizon now 
 Oh, there's still a song to sing 
 Fall down on your knees and cry aloud 
 Can you hear 
 Can you hear that thunder 
 Sing His name, sing it out 
 'Til the sky spills over 
 I hear the rolling thunder 
 Feel the pouring rain 
 My heart is filled with wonder 
 Only You remain 
 I see a new horizon 
 Coming up my way 
 I lift my eyes 
 I look to the horizon now 
 Oh, there's still a song to sing 
 Fall down on your knees and cry aloud 
 I can hear 
 I can hear that thunder 
 I'll sing Your name, sing it out 
 'Til the sky spills over 
 Oh, I can hear (I can hear) 
 I can hear that thunder 
 I'll sing Your name, sing it out 
 'Til the sky spills over (Over)

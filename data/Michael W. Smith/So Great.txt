Young and old, rich and poor, 
 Weak and strong, everyone 
 Come and rest, you are safe 
 In the arms of Jesus. 
 For He is good, 
 For he is faithful. 
 So great, so great, 
 And Your love endures forever. 
 To the end of the age, 
 Oh Your love endures forevermore. 
 Beautiful, Majesty, 
 Glorious, Holy One, 
 Rugged cross, sovereign grace, 
 Oh the blood of Jesus 
 For He is good, 
 For He is faithful. 
 So great, so great, 
 And Your love endures forever. 
 To the end of the age, 
 Oh Your love endures forever 
 So great, so great, 
 And Your love endures forever. 
 To the end of the age, 
 Oh Your love endures forevermore. 
 To the end of the age, 
 Oh Your love endures forever, 
 Your love endures forever, 
 Oh Your love endures forevermore. 
 Your love endures forever, 
 Forevermore. 
 Your love endures forever 
 To the end, You are good, You are faithful 
 Your love endures forever 
 Forever and ever!

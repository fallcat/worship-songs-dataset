Counting every moment 
 Biding all my time 
 Standing out here on my own 
 Searching for that someone 
 To heal this heart of mine 
 And keep me from being alone 
 But when will it be 
 And how will I know 
 I don't want to wait here forever? 
 Somebody love me 
 Come and carry me away 
 Somebody need me 
 To be the blue in their grey 
 Somebody want me 
 The way I've always dreamed it could be 
 Won't somebody love me, lovely? 
 I'm waiting for somebody 
 To dance across the floor 
 Sweeping me off of my feet 
 I'm looking for the right one 
 To open up that door 
 And offer me a tender retreat 
 It's like wanting to sing 
 But needing a song 
 When will I hear the music playing? 
 Somebody love me 
 Come and carry me away 
 Somebody need me 
 To be the blue in their grey 
 Somebody want me 
 The way I've always dreamed it could be 
 Won't somebody love me, lovely? 
 Somebody want me 
 The way I've always dreamed it could be 
 Somebody love me, lovely (Somebody love me) 
 Somebody love me 
 Come and carry me away 
 Somebody need me 
 To be the blue in their grey 
 Somebody want me 
 The way I've always dreamed it could be 
 Somebody love me, lovely (Somebody love me) 
 Somebody love me 
 Come and carry me away 
 Somebody need me 
 To be the blue in their grey 
 Somebody want me 
 The way I've always dreamed it could be 
 Somebody love me, lovely

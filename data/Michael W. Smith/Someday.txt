Sexual harassment, nuclear reactors. 
 Natural disasters from here to L.A. 
 Drug importers, New World Order 
 Wars over borders, murder on the subway. 
 The social classes, high rise in taxes. 
 Diplomats are passing with the promise again. 
 Talk of recession, people in depression. 
 Dow Jones, bank loans, the Japanese Yen. 
 I wait for Kingdom come, 
 When love will be here to stay. 
 It will change us everyone. 
 Someday, Someday. 
 Violence in the movies, drive-by shootings 
 Roiting and looting with the boys in the hood. 
 Cults and religions, deadly premonitions. 
 Firey opositions, evil battling good. 
 AIDS awareness, temporary marriage. 
 PRO LIFE, PRO CHOICE, Roe v. Wade. 
 Ethics and the media, tabloid TV 
 The Kennedy conspiracy, the trial of O.J. 
 I wait for Kingdom come, 
 When love will be here to stay. 
 It will change us everyone. 
 Someday, Someday. 
 Then Peace will make a stand. 
 And the anger will fall away. 
 See the Lion with the Lamb. 
 Someday, Someday, Someday. 
 I wait for Kingdom come, 
 When love will be here to stay. 
 It will change us everyone. 
 Someday, Someday. 
 Then Peace will make a stand. 
 And the anger will fall away. 
 See the Lion with the Lamb. 
 Someday, Someday, Someday. 
 Someday, Someday. 
 Then Peace will make a stand. 
 And the anger will fall away. 
 See the Lion with the Lamb...

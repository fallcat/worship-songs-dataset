Endlesss dreaming 
 I'm fast asleep, forever reaching 
 Watching and waiting 
 My heart it keeps, keeps hesitating 
 Like a canyon in the in between 
 Where I'm standing and what I can see 
 If not for You, I never move 
 You are the spark 
 You wake something in my heart 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh 
 You wake something in my heart 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh, oh oh oh... oh oh 
 My soul grows weary 
 It's only forest from the clearing 
 And it's real in my head 
 And fear's an ocean I haven't crossed yet 
 Like a canyon in the in between 
 Where I'm standing and what I can see 
 If not for You, I never move 
 You are the spark 
 You wake something in my heart 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh 
 You wake something in my heart 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh, oh oh oh... oh oh 
 You wake, wake, wake, wake, wake 
 You wake something in my heart 
 If not for You I never move 
 You are the spark, spark 
 You wake something in my heart 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh 
 You wake something in my heart 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh, oh oh oh... oh oh 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh 
 You wake something in my heart 
 Oh oh ah oh, oh oh ah oh, oh oh oh... oh oh

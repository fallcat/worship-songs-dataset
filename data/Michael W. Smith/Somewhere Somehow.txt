Standing in our silence 
 I hear my heart beating 
 And if only I could choose 
 I'd stay here with you 
 But hold me till the train is leaving 
 Somewhere down the line 
 After you're gone from sight 
 Our love will be the same 
 And, whispering your name, 
 I'll cling to you with all my might 
 Let me dream of you 
 But it's true 
 And wake me up 
 Love will be there 
 When this is over and 
 Somewhere far beyond today 
 I will find a way to find you 
 And somehow through the lonely nights 
 I will leave a light in the dark 
 Let it lead you to my heart 
 There's a love inside us 
 Deep down inside 
 That goes without saying 
 Don't say a word 
 But I'll tell you just the same 
 That love will find the flame 
 And that flame will warm the heart 
 That's waiting 
 You are mine and I'll wait for you, my love 
 You are mine, it may take some time 
 Even if it takes a lifetime 
 Tell me you'll wait 
 And somewhere far beyond today 
 I will find a way to find you 
 And somehow through the lonely nights 
 I will leave a light in the dark 
 And somewhere alone 
 Somewhere alone 
 I will be praying you home 
 Praying me home 
 I know that somehow our love 
 I know that somehow our love 
 Our love will lead me to your arms 
 And somewhere far beyond today 
 I will find a way to find you 
 And somehow through the lonely nights 
 I will leave a light in the dark 
 Let it lead you to my heart 
 Let it lead you to my heart 
 Let it lead you to my heart

Son of God, purest light, Lord on high is here tonight 
 Stamping through, this sacred sky suddenly our eyes behold 
 Heaven's perfect plan unfold, son of God 
 Son of God, love divine, timeless one, steps in to die 
 Who could dream of such a thing with us now the King of Kings 
 Man and angels bow and sing, singing Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 We're singing Gloria 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 (We're singing Gloria) 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 (Emmanuel) 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 (Emmanuel) 
 We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah 
 Our God is with us 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 (We're singing Hallelujah) 
 Singing Gloria

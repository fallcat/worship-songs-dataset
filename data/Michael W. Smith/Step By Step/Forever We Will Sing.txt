Oh God, You are my God 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 Oh God, You are my God 
 And I will ever praise You 
 I will seek You in the morning 
 And I will learn to walk in Your ways 
 And Step by step You'll lead me 
 And I will follow You all of my days 
 Hallelujah! 
 For you alone are worthy 
 And forever we will sing 
 Hallelujah! 
 Hallelujah! 
 Hallelujah! 
 Hallelujah!

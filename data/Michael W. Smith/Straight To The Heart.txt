When I'm down when my soul's in need of rest 
 Come your words of comfort and of hope 
 I see your face always smiling back at me 
 A stream of light shining straight to the heart 
 Child of God, child of light 
 There'll be no more lonely nights 
 'Cause you have brightened up my life 
 There's a road that leads me to this place 
 A path of love running straight to the heart 
 Over the years I've learned one important thing 
 It's that real friends shall never truly be apart 
 You were there in my darkest time of need 
 With a hand reaching straight to the heart 
 Child of God, child of light 
 There'll be no more lonely nights 
 'Cause you have brightened up my life 
 Take this gift, it is all I have to give 
 A prayer of love forever straight to the heart 
 A prayer of love forever straight to the heart

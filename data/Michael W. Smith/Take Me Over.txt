Just to rest in your arms 
 Close enough to hear your heart 
 Just to kneel at your feet 
 Where everything fades away and I sing 
 Jesus, Jesus, take me over now 
 I surrender 
 Everything I have, I lay it down 
 All of me 
 With just a glimpse of your face 
 All my fears melt away 
 Lost within your embrace 
 I'm pouring out all my admiration

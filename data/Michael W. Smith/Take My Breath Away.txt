Always so beautiful 
 The earth displays Your majesty 
 How could you ever be 
 So mindful of 
 Someone as me? 
 You captivate 
 Splendor I have never seen 
 Nothing else can compare 
 You're infinite 
 You're everywhere 
 You're everything I can't explain 
 You set my heart up higher 
 And here I stand amazed 
 You take my breath away 
 You take my breath away 
 You've seen me all I am 
 These empty hands are all I can give 
 That you would die so I live 
 Sacrifice I can't believe 
 You fascinate 
 You stole my heart 
 I can't forget 
 And now that I've felt Your love 
 No turning back 
 I can't get enough 
 You're everything I can't explain 
 You set my heart up higher 
 And here I stand amazed 
 You take my breath away 
 The morning breaks 
 My soul awakes 
 You are my one desire 
 And here I stand amazed 
 You take my breath away 
 You take my breath away, yeah-ay 
 Whoa-oh 
 With just one word 
 With just one glance 
 I'm lost in this devine moment 
 And every single day 
 More than I can say 
 You take my breath away 
 You're everything I can't explain 
 You set my heart up higher 
 And here I stand amazed 
 You take my breath away 
 The morning breaks 
 My soul awakes 
 You are my one desire 
 And here I stand amazed 
 You take my breath away 
 Sing oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Take my breath away 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh 
 Whoa-oh, oh-oh 
 Whoa-oh, oh-oh 
 Take my breath away 
 You take my breath away

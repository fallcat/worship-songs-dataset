Sitting alone up in your empty room 
 In the stillness of the night 
 Where all the many dreams that used 
 To carry you 
 Are no longer in sight 
 You put your feelings down in black 
 And white 
 A sad, disturbing reply 
 That you don't really want to face 
 Another night 
 So you're saying goodbye 
 But did you know that you're saying 
 Goodbye 
 To a lifetime 
 Well I've got to tell you there's 
 Another way 
 To be free-to be complete 
 But you've got to make it through 
 Another day 
 And deny you're own defeat 
 (Don't give in) 
 And I'm here to tell you there's 
 Another way 
 To comsume a hungry heart 
 All the love you need is just a prayer 
 Away 
 Let him in to where you are 
 You've made it to the edge of 
 Seventeen 
 Thinking now you've reached the end 
 Of the line 
 But there's so much of life that you 
 Have never seen 
 Now you won't have the time 
 You say that you don't hear the 
 Music play 
 So your ready to give up the dance 
 Now that nothing really matters 
 Anyway 
 Oh, you give up your chance 
 But do you know that you give up 
 Your chance 
 At a lifetime 
 Well I've got to tell you there's 
 Another way 
 To be free-to be complete 
 But you've got to make it through 
 Another day 
 And deny you're own defeat 
 (Don't give in) 
 And I'm here to tell you there's 
 Another way 
 To comsume a hungry heart 
 Jesus is just a prayer away 
 Let him in to where you are

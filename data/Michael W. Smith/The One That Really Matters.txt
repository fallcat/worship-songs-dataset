I feel You so close to me 
 I can hardly move or breathe 
 I can feel Your presence all around 
 I fall knees down to the ground 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 I know that I have been found 
 The cares of life can't hold me down 
 'Cause You're the one I want to please 
 What matters now is what You think 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 I know that I have been found 
 The cares of life can't hold me down 
 'Cause You're the one I want to please 
 What matters now is what You think 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 'Cause no one is like you 
 No one like you 
 No one yeh yeh 
 Send your glory, send your presence 
 No one like you, no one 
 And I can't help but scream about the way that You moved in 
 Chaotic love has messed me up so I could live again 
 And I can't help but scream about the way that You moved in 
 Chaotic love has messed me up so I could live again 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters 
 You're the one that really matters (yeah) 
 You're the one that really matters (really matters) 
 You're the one that really matters (You're the one that really matters)

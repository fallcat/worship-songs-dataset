If they were to write about 
 The story of my life 
 They would have to mention you 
 With every page they'd write 
 There's another side to every story told 
 If I were the ocean 
 You would be the shore 
 One without the other one 
 Would be need something more 
 We are the shadow and the light 
 Always love me 
 Never leave me now 
 Now you are the other side of me 
 Always love me 
 Never leave me now 
 Now you are the other side of me 
 I have known the emptiness 
 Of feeling out of touch 
 And living life without you here 
 Would be living half as much 
 'Cause I've a need that only you could fill 
 If love was mathematical 
 You'd understand the sum 
 To the heart's equation 
 Where one and one makes one 
 And lonely equals me minus you 
 Always love me 
 Never leave me now 
 Now you are the other side of me

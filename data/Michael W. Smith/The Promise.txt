Fear not, oh, Israel for there is peace still to come 
 A word to break the silence, a promise set to bloom 
 The promise to redeem us, one to free us 
 Break this silence in the violence in our lives 
 Emmanuel is sure to find us soon 
 The mighty rule to Jesse's star of truth 
 And bring us unto glory, tell His story 
 Heal the broken and restore thee to His name 
 The star will guide us to the humble place 
 Where Christ the King reveals His earthly face 
 And we will see Emmanuel, God is with us 
 God is for us, God is in us, we will see 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 We're singing Hallelujah 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us 
 Emmanuel, our God is with us

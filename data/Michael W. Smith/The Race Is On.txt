Got our feet on a narrow road 
 Got our eyes on the one who 
 Will be our goal 
 And our brothers at our side 
 If we stumble we won't fall 
 If we miss the mark he'll be 
 There after all 
 With an everlasting prize 
 The race is on 
 Come on and go 
 Leave behind the sin you find 
 That slows your time 
 Come on and go 
 You know the race is on 
 Come on and go 
 Straight ahead be safely led 
 By him instead 
 Come on and go 
 You know the race is on 
 Lord, I try running my own race 
 Losin' ground, losin' hope 
 Losin' sight of your face 
 And I'm ready to retire 
 Then I'm back on your solid ground 
 You remind me of the strength 
 That in you I've found 
 And you fill me with your fire 
 The race is on

I feel it, I feel it, I feel it in my bones 
 And I just don't think I can hold it anymore 
 The river is rising, flowing out of me 
 And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive 
 I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet 
 'Cause the river is rising, flowing out of me 
 Got to let the world know, take it to the streets 
 Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise 
 Hallelujah, the river is rising 
 Hallelujah, the river is rising 
 I feel it, I feel it, I feel it in my bones 
 And I just don't think I can hold it anymore 
 The river is rising, flowing out of me 
 And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive 
 I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet 
 'Cause the river is rising, flowing out of me 
 Got to let the world know, take it to the streets 
 I got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise 
 Hallelujah, the river is rising 
 Hallelujah, gonna dance and sing and add a shout of praise 
 Hallelujah, the river is rising 
 Hallelujah 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, the river is rising 
 The river is rising, oh, oh 
 I feel it, I feel it, I feel it in my bones 
 And I just don't think I can hold it anymore 
 The river is rising, flowing out of me 
 And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive 
 I'm gonna dance, sing and move my feet 
 The river is rising, flowing out of me 
 Got to let the world know, take it to the streets 
 Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise 
 Hallelujah, the river is rising 
 Hallelujah, got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise 
 Hallelujah, the river is rising 
 Hallelujah, got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

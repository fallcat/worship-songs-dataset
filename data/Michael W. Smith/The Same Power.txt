There is power in His name 
 For the stone was rolled away 
 Mountains bow down before 
 Jesus Christ, our risen Lord 
 Jesus Christ, our risen Lord 
 Mighty Savior, lifted high 
 King forever, Jesus Christ 
 Crowned in glory, raised to life 
 The same power lives in us 
 We will rise, stand and sing 
 Of our great and matchless King 
 Seated high on the throne 
 You shall reign forevermore 
 You shall reign forevermore 
 Mighty Savior, lifted high 
 King forever, Jesus Christ 
 Crowned in glory, raised to life 
 The same power lives in us 
 The grave could not contain 
 The power of His name 
 Death, You overcame 
 Once and for all 
 The grave could not contain 
 The power of His name 
 Death, You overcame 
 Once and for all 
 The grave could not contain 
 The power of His name 
 Death, You overcame 
 Once and for all 
 The grave could not contain 
 The power of His name 
 Death, You overcame 
 Once and for all 
 Mighty Savior, lifted high 
 King forever, Jesus Christ 
 Crowned in glory, raised to life 
 The same power lives in us 
 The same power lives in us

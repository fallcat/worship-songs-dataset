I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned 
 In awe of the one who gave it all 
 I'll stand my soul Lord to you surrender 
 All I am is yours 
 I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned 
 In awe of the one who gave it all 
 I'll stand my soul Lord to you surrendered 
 All I am is yours 
 I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned 
 In awe of the one who gave it all 
 I'll stand 
 My soul, lord, to you surrendered 
 All I am is yours 
 I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned 
 In awe of the one who gave it all 
 I'll stand 
 My soul, lord, to you surrendered 
 All I am is yours 
 I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned 
 In awe of the one who gave it all 
 I'll stand 
 My soul, lord, to you surrendered 
 All I am is yours

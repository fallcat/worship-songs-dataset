Far above the highest heavens 
 On a throne of crystal light 
 Dwells the God of all creation 
 Rays of wonder crown His might 
 Human voices blend with the angels 
 Giving praise to God alone 
 Heavens music rises upward 
 To the Lamb upon the throne 
 To the Lamb upon the throne 
 Blessing! Glory! Sing Hallelujah! 
 Shout the saints of God alone 
 Honor! Power! and Dominion! 
 Praises gather at the throne 
 Oh, they gather at the crystal throne 
 Gather at the crystal throne 
 Lightning flashes and thunder echoes 
 Diamond rainbows fill the sky 
 Awesome beauty God's provision 
 Never seen by human eye 
 Blazing colors show the glory 
 Of the Master Artist's plan 
 Built by god for those who love Him 
 Those who trust the great "I am" 
 Those who trust the great "I am"

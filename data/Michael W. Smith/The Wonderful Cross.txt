When I survey the wondrous cross 
 On which the Prince of Glory died 
 My Richest gain I count but loss 
 And pour contempt on all my pride 
 See from His head His hands His feet 
 Sorrow and love mingled down 
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Bides me come and die and find 
 That I may truly live 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here by grace 
 Draw here and bless your name 
 Were the whole realm of nature mine 
 That were and an off'ring far too small 
 Love so amazing so divine 
 Demands my soul my life my all 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die and find 
 That I may truly live 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here by grace 
 Draw here and bless your name 
 Life so amazing, so divine 
 Demands my soul. my life, my all 
 And the beauty and the shame 
 In the glory of His name 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die and find 
 That I may truly live 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here by grace 
 Draw here and bless your name

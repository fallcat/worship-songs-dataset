I don't know how to breathe 
 I don't know how to leave You 
 I don't know what to say 
 And who am I to say it anyway? 
 But there is always a song 
 And I'll try to sing along over You 
 I can hear it being sung 
 All of Heaven sings along over You 
 I hardly know Your name 
 I didn't come to save You 
 Your smile just broke my heart 
 Now You're in my heart 
 I know You'll never leave me 
 But there is always a song 
 And I'll try to sing along over You 
 I can hear it being sung 
 All of Heaven sings along over You 
 But there is always a song 
 And I'll try to sing along over You 
 Sing, sing like you've never sung 
 Sing for your joy to come 
 Sing, sing like you've never sung 
 Sing of my joy to come 
 There is always a song 
 And I'll try to sing along over You 
 I can hear it being sung 
 All of Heaven sings along over You 
 There is always a song 
 And I'll try to sing along over You 
 There is always a song 
 And I'll try to sing along over You 
 Always for You

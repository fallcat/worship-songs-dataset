When the night seems to say 
 All hope is lost, gone away 
 But I know I'm not alone 
 By the light she stands 
 There she waves, faithful friend 
 Shimmering stars, westward wind 
 Show the way, Carry me 
 To the place she stands 
 Just when you think it might be over 
 Just when you think the fight is gone 
 Someone will risk his life to raise her 
 There she stands 
 There she flies, clear blue skies 
 Reminds us with red of those that died 
 Washed in white by the brave 
 In their strength, she stands 
 When evil calls itself a martyr 
 When all your hopes come crashing down 
 Someone will pull her from the rubble 
 There she stands 
 We've seen her flying torn and tattered 
 We've seen her stand the test of time 
 And through it all the fools have fallen 
 There she stands 
 By the dawn's, early light 
 And through the fight. She stands

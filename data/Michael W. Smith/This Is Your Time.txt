It was a test we could all hope to pass 
 But none of us would want to take 
 Faced with the choice to deny God to live 
 For her, there was one choice to make 
 This was her time, this was her dance 
 She lived every moment, left nothing to chance 
 She swam in the sea, drank of the deep 
 Embraced the mystery of all she could be 
 This was her time 
 Though you are mourning and grieving with us 
 Death died a long time ago 
 Swallowed in life so that life carries on 
 Still it's so hard to let go 
 This was her time, this was her dance 
 She lived every moment, left nothing to chance 
 She swam in the sea, drank of the deep 
 Embraced the mystery of all she could be 
 What if tomorrow and what if today 
 Faced with the question oh what would you say? 
 This is your time, this is your dance 
 Live every moment, leave nothing to chance 
 Swim in the sea, drink of the deep 
 Follow the mercy and hear yourself praying 
 Won't you save me? Won't you save me? 
 This is your time, this is your dance 
 Live every moment, leave nothing to chance 
 Swim in the sea, drink of the deep 
 Embrace the mystery of all you can be 
 This is your time, this is your dance 
 Live every moment, leave nothing to chance 
 Swim in the sea, drink of the deep 
 Embrace the mystery of all you can be 
 This is your time 
 Won't you save me? 
 This is your time Won't you save me?

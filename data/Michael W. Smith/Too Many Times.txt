Who do I hope to finally be? 
 Is it not your life in me? 
 Yet the how's too hard to see 
 Too many times 
 Will I ever finally be 
 The true, intented me? 
 And the old in me be freed 
 And left behind? 
 Too many times 
 I'm back inside 
 Wanting desperately to hide 
 Yet I know, I know you say 
 You have to die 
 Too many times 
 You hear my cries 
 I'm at the end of all my tries 
 So, I'm open Lord, so 
 Teach me how to die 
 Here I am again alone 
 Afraid I'll lose all that I own 
 Yet you see me as your own 
 I cannot fall 
 And what I am I still am not 
 At times I count the cost 
 Yet I find there's nothing lost 
 If I give it all

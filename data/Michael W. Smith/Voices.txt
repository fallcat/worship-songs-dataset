Words and Music: Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick 
 Follow the footsteps 
 Or travel down your own road 
 Designing your fate 
 Hear what your heart says 
 Still you decide which way to go 
 Your life's an open gate 
 'Le bon et 'le mal 
 These are the voices 
 We nous somme liberti' 
 We make the choices 
 Echoes of laughter 
 Dancing in distant corridors 
 With the tears of hearts undone 
 Dreams we chase after 
 Give us the key to any door 
 We are what we become 
 Holding and reaching 
 We face the calm, we face the fear 
 As we learn to win and lose 
 Voices are speaking 
 Still we hear what we want to hear 
 Our life is ours to choose

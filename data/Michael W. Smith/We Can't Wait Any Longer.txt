A silent call from a distant land 
 Crying for a helping hand, so 
 How long will it go on? 
 Ignorance and vanity 
 Supercede humanity, so 
 How long it will go on? 
 I want to know how long will it go on? 
 We can't wait any longer 
 They're crying out, doesn't it matter 
 We can't wait any longer 
 No, no. Too long in a slumber 
 Shake it up, wake it up now. 
 We can't wait any longer. No, no. 
 Another child is laid to rest 
 Another day of hopelessnes, so 
 How long it will go on? 
 And every day we're on the fence brings 
 Another fatal consequence, so 
 How long will it go on? 
 I want to know, how long will it go on? 
 Yuko awezayo kusikia kilio chetu? (Can somebody hear us crying out?) 
 Twaomba msaada wenu (Somebody help us) 
 Aweko mwenye kuttuoka (Somebody save us) 
 Aweko mwenye kutupa uhuru (Somebody free us)

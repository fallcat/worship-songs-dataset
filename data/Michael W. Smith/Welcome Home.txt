I can't believe that I'm here having to say goodbye 
 And I can barely see you through these tears I cry 
 I close my eyes 
 I can hear the sound 
 As angels gather 'round 
 Saying this is where you belong 
 Welcome home 
 There are the days that my heart aches wishing you were here 
 But I know where you are the hurt and the pain disappear 
 There's no more tears 
 What a lovely sound 
 Angels all around 
 Saying this is where you belong 
 Welcome home 
 Welcome home 
 Welcome home

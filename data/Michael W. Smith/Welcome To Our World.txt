Welcome to Our World 
 Performed by Michael W. Smith 
 Words and Music by Chris Rice 
 Tears are falling, hearts are breaking 
 How we need to hear from God 
 You've been promised, we've been waiting 
 Welcome Holy Child 
 Welcome Holy Child 
 Hope that you don't mind our manger 
 How I wish we would have known 
 But long awaited Holy Stranger 
 Make yourself at home 
 Please make yourself at home 
 Bring your peace into our violence 
 Bid our hungry souls be filled 
 World now breaking Heaven's silence 
 Welcome to our world 
 Welcome to our world 
 Fragile finger sent to heal us 
 Tender brow prepared for thorn 
 Tiny heart whose blood will save us 
 Unto us is born 
 Unto us is born 
 So wrap our injured flesh around You 
 Breathe our air and walk our sod 
 Rob our sin and make us holy 
 Perfect Son of God 
 Perfect Son of God 
 Welcome to our world

When I think of You 
 I see You dancing, You're dancing

 I hear You singing to me 
 When I think of You 
 I see You praying, You're praying 
 When I think of You 
 I hear You calling for me 
 Yahweh, there is no one like You, Lord 
 Yahweh, Hallelujah, we sing 
 Yahweh, there is no one like You, Lord 
 Yahweh, Your banner for me 
 Your banner for me is love 
 When I think of You 
 I see You dancing, You're dancing

Word of mouth is the counselor 
 There is no need for proof 
 In a world that's wired for sound 
 The tongue becomes the mighty sword 
 That battles the truth 
 In a world that's wired for sound 
 Coming on like a tidal wave 
 That washes through the brain-a state of mind 
 No dispute when the noise is made 
 And so it lets the blind lead the blind 
 Lured by charisma to be swayed to believe 
 Word of mouth is the counselor 
 There is no need for proof 
 In a world that's wired for sound 
 The tongue becomes the mighty sword 
 That battles the truth 
 In a world that's wired for sound 
 Easier believing what is hard to get rid of than to try 
 Never searching-just accepting 
 Feeds the mind enough to get you by 
 Scratching the surface yet to dig deeper down 
 Word of mouth is the counselor 
 There is no need for proof 
 In a world that's wired for sound 
 The tongue becomes the mighty sword 
 That battles the truth 
 In a world that's wired for sound 
 Wisdom from the sacred page 
 Is turned and ignored 
 In a world that's wired for sound

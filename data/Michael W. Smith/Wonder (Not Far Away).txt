Everybody wants to find a way 
 Everybody needs to know 
 There's a reason we can trade our pain 
 And replace it with a rush of hope 
 Everybody with a weary heart 
 Can fall and rise again from grace 
 And when we're searching for a place to start 
 The broken still can say 
 You're not far away 
 You're not far away 
 Every moment you're a mystery 
 A miracle that makes me wonder 
 Everybody has enough to bear 
 And everyone feels the strain 
 There's a lot that really isn't fair 
 But it isn't more than you can take 
 Everybody needs a hand to hold 
 To have a reason not to break 
 Everybody with a heavy load 
 Rest is on its way 
 You're not far away 
 You're not far away 
 Closer now, like a song in me 
 You're everything I need to know 
 You're not far away 
 You're not far away 
 You're alive in every word I sing 
 You're a miracle that makes me wonder

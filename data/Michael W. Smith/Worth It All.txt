Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be 
 Living life on the other side please don't 
 Make me feel like I don't know what's out 
 There proof is written in the sky hey 
 Won't you listen to me now it makes no 
 Difference if I wish upon a star the only 
 Absolute is that the word of life is 
 Written on my heart oh I believe yes, I 
 Believe 
 Hey look at me, living life for you 
 When it's good, when it's hard you know 
 Me, you know my heart, yeah, yeah, yeah, I give 
 Up anything at all, when you call all I 
 Know it's worth it all 
 I know you're scared 
 To let me know you I know you got a 
 Heavy kind of soul and I know it's harder 
 To believe in love when you're feeling 
 All alone they're taking bets on who the 
 Lover of your soul and your heart is 
 Gonna be they're taking on all the things 
 That get you down and out the moment 
 You believe I believe in you Yes I believe 
 In you

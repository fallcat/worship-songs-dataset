You are the flame that's growing deep inside 
 You are the blazing passion in my eyes 
 You are the aching shut up in my bones 
 You are the longing that won't let me go 
 Let it burn, let it burn now 
 Oh from the inside out 
 Let it rage, let it rage now 
 You are the fire 
 You are the fire 
 You're all consuming, You can't be contained 
 Never relenting, changing everything 
 You are the love that overwhelms my heart 
 You are the fire lighting up the dark 
 Let it burn, let it burn now 
 Oh from the inside out 
 Let it rage, let it rage now 
 You are the fire 
 You are the fire 
 Let it burn, let it burn now 
 Oh from the inside out 
 Let it rage, let it rage now 
 You are the fire 
 You are the fire 
 Fan the flames 'til the whole world sees us burn 
 You are the fire 
 Fan the flames 'til the whole world sees us burn 
 You are the fire 
 Fan the flames 'til the whole world sees us burn 
 You are the fire 
 Fan the flames 'til the whole world sees us burn 
 Let it burn, let it burn now 
 Oh from the inside out 
 Let it rage, let it rage now 
 You are the fire 
 You are the fire 
 You are the fire

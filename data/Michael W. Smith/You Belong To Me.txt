I knew you were the one 
 My heart was overcome 
 The day I looked into your eyes 
 The feeling so surreal 
 Like time was standing still 
 When you said you would be mine 
 Oh, you are a miracle 
 You're sweeter than I've ever dreamed 
 You're so much more than beautiful 
 How can it be that you belong to me? 
 So walk with me awhile 
 And we will spend our lives 
 Learning the mysteries of love 
 And through the darkest nights 
 We'll hold each other tight 
 I promise that it will be enough 
 Oh, you are a miracle 
 You're sweeter than I've ever dreamed 
 You're so much more, more than beautiful 
 How can it be that you belong to me? 
 Oh girl, you are more than beautiful 
 How can this be that you belong to me? 
 I love you, I love you, I love you 
 Girl, I love you 
 Oh, you are, you are more than beautiful 
 How can this be that you belong to me?

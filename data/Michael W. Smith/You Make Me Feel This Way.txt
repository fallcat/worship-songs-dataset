My heart is beating fast, sun is beating down 
 Your song is in my head and it keeps spinning around 
 Like walking streets of gold with diamonds in my eyes 
 I can't explain it how the world just comes to life 
 Sing it over, I'll sing it over 
 No doubt, no doubt 
 Oh You make me feel 
 Sing it over, I'll sing it over 
 No doubt, no doubt 
 You make me feel this way, yes 
 You make me feel this way 
 So close to something, something I've never seen 
 Sleeping awake, maybe it's somewhere in between 
 Felt like a fugitive staring at the gun 
 No longer chasing me, no, I don't have to run 
 Sing it over, I'll sing it over 
 No doubt, no doubt 
 Oh You make me feel 
 Sing it over, I'll sing it over 
 No doubt, no doubt 
 You make me feel this way 
 You make me feel this way 
 You make me feel this way 
 You make me feel this way 
 Like an ocean wave in the wind 
 It's a moment I won't forget 
 Like an ocean wave in the wind 
 Close my eyes, I'm a child again 
 You make me feel this way, yeah 
 You make me feel this way, yeah 
 Sing it over, sing it over 
 Oh, You make me feel this way

 Made a friend last night, or you thought you did 
 Had a drink, had a talk, took a drive 
 Shared the night, gave up a part of your soul 
 Now she's gone and you're a little less alive. 
 Shake it off, never let your feelings begin 
 But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in. 
 Yes, you really need a saviour 
 Somehow you've known it all along 
 Yes, you really need a saviour 
 You know you've heard it for so long 
 Yes, You really need a saviour 
 Someone to come and lead you on 
 You need a saviour 
 You need a saviour 
 It's time 
 Told yourself today just for your own sake 
 What was lost wouldn't cost anyway 
 Life's a one night stand, this time you'll win 
 The up and down, life-long game that you play. 
 Shake it off, never let your feelings begin 
 But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in.

No shadow comes without the light making a way 
 No raging storm can ever defy one word of faith 
 My heart remains sure in the wind, sure in the waves 
 You are the anchor for my soul 
 You won't let go 
 You won't let go 
 No matter what may come I know 
 You won't let go 
 No valley low, changes the truth 
 So I'm not afraid 
 You hold me close 
 You lead me through, light up the way 
 You are the anchor for my soul 
 You won't let go 
 You won't let go 
 No matter what may come I know 
 You won't let go 
 You won't let go 
 Neither life, neither death, 
 The highest high, the deepest depth 
 Nothing can 
 Nothing can separate 
 Neither tears, neither trials 
 Certain as the sun will rise 
 Nothing can 
 Nothing can separate 
 Neither life, neither death, 
 The highest high, the deepest depth 
 Nothing can separate 
 Nothing can separate 
 Neither tears, neither trials 
 Certain as the sun will rise 
 Nothing can 
 Nothing can separate 
 You are the anchor for my soul 
 You won't let go 
 You won't let go 
 No matter what may come I know 
 You won't let go 
 My heart remains sure in the wind 
 Sure in the waves, always

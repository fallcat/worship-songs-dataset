You take a look inside 
 But you don't like what you see 
 And so you choose to look away 
 It doesn't coincide 
 With how you'd like to be 
 And each glimpse of hope can easily fade 
 Down on your confidence 
 It's a fight that won't let go 
 But you've got to realise 
 That you're alright 
 'Cause under your rubble 
 Lies a heart the father holds 
 And when you see your life 
 Through his eyes 
 You're alright 
 To learn how he loves you 
 Is to learn to love yourself 
 To live the life he's living in you 
 And what others think of you 
 Could never messure to the wealth 
 Of what he's paid and given to you 
 Down on your confidence 
 It's a fight that won't let go 
 But you've got to realise 
 That you're alright 
 'Cause under your rubble 
 Lies a heart the father holds 
 And when you see your life 
 Through his eyes 
 You're alright

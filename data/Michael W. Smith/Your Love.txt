I took a journey through the devil's door 
 Chasing the freedom that I thought was Yours 
 Just found the bottom of an icy floor and regret 
 With trembling hands and an empty breath 
 You saw the struggle and You cast the nets 
 You knew me better than I ever knew myself 
 And now the only thing that's left... oh-oh-ooh 
 Is Your love 
 Is Your love 
 I crossed the ocean and I searched the sky 
 For the riddles and the reasons why 
 You give a beggar like me a royal life, oh-oh-ooh 
 With trembling hands and an empty breath 
 You saw the struggle and You cast the nets 
 You knew me better than I ever knew myself 
 And now the only thing that's left... oh-oh-ooh 
 Is Your love 
 Is Your love 
 My heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me 
 My heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me 
 Your love, Your love, Your love 
 Your love is endless 
 Your love, Your love, Your love 
 Your love is endless 
 My heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me 
 My heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me 
 I can feel it, I hear it loud and clear 
 My heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me 
 I can feel it, I hear it loud and clear 
 My heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me 
 I can feel it 
 I hear it

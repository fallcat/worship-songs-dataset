Lord, I will seek You 
 On my bed, think upon You 
 In the day, I'll dream of You 
 You're always on my mind 
 With my whole heart, I'll love You 
 With my mind and my strength too 
 Waste my life searching for You 
 You're always on my mind 
 Though I'm poor and needy 
 The Lord thinks upon me 
 Though His name is Holy 
 I'm always on His mind 
 I'm always on His mind 
 Though I'm weak and lowly 
 The Lord thinks about me 
 Though He's high and lofty 
 I'm always on His mind 
 I'm always on His mind 
 For I'm in love with God 
 And God's in love with me 
 How far will You let me go? 
 How abandoned will You let me be?

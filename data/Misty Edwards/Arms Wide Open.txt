"What does love look like?" is the question I've been pondering 
 "What does love look like?" 
 "What does love look like?" is the question I've been asking of You 
 I once believed that love was romance, just a chance 
 I even thought that love was for the lucky and the beautiful 
 I once believed that love was a momentary bliss 
 But love is more than this 
 All You ever wanted was my attention 
 All You ever wanted was love from me 
 All You ever wanted was my affections, to sit here at Your feet 
 Then tell me 
 "What does love look like?" is the question I've been pondering 
 "What does love look like?" 
 Then I sat down, a little frustrated and confused 
 If all of life comes down to love 
 Then love has to be more than sentiment 
 More than selfishness and selfish gain 
 And then I saw Him there, hanging on a tree, looking at me 
 I saw Him there, hanging on a tree, looking at me 
 He was looking at me, looking at Him, staring through me 
 I could not escape those beautiful eyes 
 And I began to weep and weep 
 He had arms wide open, a heart exposed 
 Arms wide open; He was bleeding, bleeding 
 Love's definition, love's definition was looking at me 
 Looking at Him, hanging on a tree 
 I began to weep and weep and weep and weep 
 This is how I know what love is, this is how I know what love is 
 And as I sat there weeping, crying 
 Those beautiful eyes, full of desire and love 
 He said to me: 
 "You shall love Me, You shall love Me 
 You shall love Me, You shall love Me" 
 With arms wide open, a heart exposed 
 With arms wide open, bleeding, sometimes bleeding 
 If anybody's looking for love in all the wrong places 
 If you've been searching for love, come to Me, come to Me 
 Take up your cross, deny yourself 
 Forget your father's house and run, run with Me 
 You were made for abandonment, wholeheartedness 
 You were made for someone greater, someone bigger, so follow Me 
 And You'll come alive when you learn to die

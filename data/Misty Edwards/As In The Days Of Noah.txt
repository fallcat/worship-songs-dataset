Time, time is ticking by 
 And I can feel an explosion inside 
 And time, time is ticking by 
 And I can feel an explosion inside 
 As in the days of Noah 
 As in the days of Noah 
 There will be drinking, marrying, laughing 
 As in the days of Noah 
 "What a fool," they'll say 
 "To build a boat on sand!" 
 "What a fool," they'll say 
 As in the days of Noah 
 "What a fool," they'll say 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before!" 
 As in the days of Noah 
 So it will be in the coming 
 Of the Son of Man 
 And "What a fool," they'll say 
 "To fast and pray." 
 And "What a fool," they'll say 
 "Come on, it's been two thousand years. 
 "Do you really think He's coming? 
 "Come on, just get real." 
 And remember this verse 
 "And many, many scoffers will come..." 
 And when the rain starts falling 
 It's too late 
 It's too late 
 And when the rain starts falling 
 It's too late 
 It's too late 
 As in the days of Noah 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before!" 
 One day, two days, three days gone by 
 And time, time is ticking by 
 And I can feel an explosion inside! 
 People get ready 
 Jesus is coming 
 "And many, many scoffers will rise in that day" 
 And they'll say 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before! 
 "It's never rained before!" 
 "Rain, rain, go away! 
 Hide me from the wrath of the Lamb!" 
 And when the rain starts falling 
 It's too late. 
 And when the rain starts falling 
 It's too late 
 And when the rain starts falling 
 It's too late 
 And when the rain starts falling 
 It's too late

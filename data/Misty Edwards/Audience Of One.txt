A room within a room am I 
 A world within the world outside 
 Hidden from the eyes of men, I'm your secret 
 Most of life is lived inside 
 In visions of the soul and mind 
 Don't want to waste this sacred space 
 When you're in it 
 I am your cathedral 
 In the midst of the people 
 In the congregation 
 Life is lived 
 Before the audience of one 
 Everything I say and do 
 Every little part of me 
 You see the silent conversations in my head 
 You see me when I rise, I fall 
 My God, my God, you see it all 
 Every dream I dream while on my bed 
 A room within a room am I 
 A world within the world outside 
 You fill me with your glory 
 Then you break out 
 A tabernacle filled with you 
 A riverbed that flows into 
 The desert of this broken world 
 God break out 
 Break out 
 Break out 
 Break out 
 I am your cathedral 
 In the midst of the people 
 In the congregation 
 Life is lived 
 Before the audience of one

I can hear the song of the Creator 
 As He sings over His creation 
 I played the flute for You 
 Did You dance? 
 I sang the wedding song over You 
 Were You romanced? 
 I played the funeral song 
 And told You my judgments were coming 
 Did you lament? 
 For even children know when to dance 
 Even children know the sound of the wedding 
 Even children know when to repent 
 At the sound of the funeral they lament 
 Baptize my heart with Your fire 
 Your desire 
 I don't want to be offended 
 I don't want to be offended 
 I don't want to be offended 
 When it's all coming down 
 I pledge my allegiance to Jesus 
 I pledge my allegiance to the Lamb

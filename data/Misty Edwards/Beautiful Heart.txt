There is no shadow of turning in You 
 No rebellion or pride 
 You don't know greed or envy or strife 
 Your intentions are pure and holy 
 Delighting to do the Father's will 
 You don't have a thought against Him 
 But humbly You live in perfect restraint 
 Waiting for promises given 
 Jesus, You have a beautiful heart 
 Jesus, You have a beautiful heart 
 You're gentle, You're meek, yet Your heart is strong 
 Jesus, Your gladness is contagious 
 You are not selfish, You can't compromise 
 You are the truth, You can't lie 
 You don't hold a grudge or have a cynical eye 
 Bitterness has no part of You 
 But You're quick to forgive, let me back in again 
 Your kindness is so liberating 
 Jesus, You have a beautiful heart 
 Jesus, You have a beautiful heart

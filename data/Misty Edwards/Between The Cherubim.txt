We will awaken the dawn 
 With a song in the night 
 For a new day will come 
 Just as sure as the sun will rise 
 Though deep darkness prevail 
 For the night weeping endures 
 Yet Your light will not fail 
 You won't rest until our righteousness shines 
 You who dwell between the cherubim 
 To You we cry 
 Oh, Shepherd of Israel 
 Restore and cause Your face to shine 
 Don't remember our former sin 
 Let Your mercy speedily come 
 Oh, Shepherd of Israel 
 Restore and cause Your face to shine 
 Though we're feasting on the bread of affliction 
 And the water of tears is our wine 
 We won't draw back 
 We will run to You 
 For we know it's just a matter of time 
 You will answer the cry of Your people 
 And Your ear is attentive to their sighs 
 So we lift up our voice to You 
 And we sing in the dawning light 
 For the glory of Your name 
 For Your glory and your fame 
 Though the earth be removed 
 We lift our hands to only You 
 For the glory of Your name 
 For Your glory and Your fame 
 Though the nations rage toward You 
 Let our love remain true

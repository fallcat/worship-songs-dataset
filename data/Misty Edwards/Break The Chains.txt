Come break the chains, 
 The chains that hinder love. 
 All that remains of yester year. 
 Come break the chains, 
 The chains that pull me down. 
 Come break the chains and draw me near. 
 Let Your fire burn consuming me, 
 Let Your jealous flame 
 Come take away everything! 
 Let Your fire burn consuming me, 
 Let Your jealous flame 
 Come write Your name upon my heart, 
 Until all that remains 
 Is the Light of Your countenance 
 And I will be satisfied when I awaken 
 As a lover of You! 
 Come break the chains, 
 The chains that hinder love. 
 All that remains of yester year. 
 Come break the chains, 
 The chains that pull me down. 
 Come break the chains and draw me near. 
 Hum 
 Who is this is garments stained red 
 Who is this crowns on His head 
 Who is this He roaring like a lion 
 Who is this He's roaring from Zion, 
 He's roaring from Zion 
 Who is this King of glory (Repeat x3) 
 He is mighty to save all who call on His name 
 In righteousness He is mighty to save 
 He's mighty to save all who call on His name 
 But woe to the enemy 
 Of the King on His Wedding day 
 But woe to the enemy 
 Of the King on His Wedding day 
 All of your judgments... just and true. 
 Let Your fire burn consuming me, 
 Let Your jealous flame 
 Come take away everything! 
 Let Your fire burn consuming me, 
 Let Your jealous flame 
 Come write Your name upon my heart, 
 Until all that remains 
 Is the Light of Your countenance 
 And I will be satisfied when I awaken 
 As a lover of You!

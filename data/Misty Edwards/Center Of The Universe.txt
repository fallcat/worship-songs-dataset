People plotting, scheming, 
 Dreaming of a world with no restraint, no truth 
 Kings they gather together, 
 Plot an overthrow to rid the earth of You 
 But the Father delights to enthrone His Son 
 We join in the pleasure 
 And crown You with our love 
 Today You're enthroned above the circle of the earth 
 Tomorrow, in Jerusalem, the center of the universe 
 In the city of confusion there's delusion 
 As men like specks expect to conquer God 
 They don't want Your mercy 
 They don't want You, Your book, Your Man 
 Your plan, Your forgiveness, Your beauty 
 Bow down, kiss the Son 
 Come into the kingdom of love 
 Bow down, kiss the Son 
 Come into the kingdom of love 
 Even so Your will be done 
 The Spirit and the Bride we cry Your kingdom come 
 Anybody thirst come, to the wedding of the Lamb 
 Into the kingdom of love 
 Bow down and kiss the Son

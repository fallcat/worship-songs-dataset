Come as close as You want 
 Consume this heart that longs to burn 
 I know Your fire can hurt 
 But I would be worse here without You 
 For I was made to dwell with You 
 And how I ache until I do 
 Holy God, Take my heart 
 Purge with flame and truth 
 A holy heart is all I want 
 That I may live with You 
 Come and take all these chains 
 That get in the way of what You want 
 And as I stand in the flame 
 Still I will say, "I trust You God" 
 For I was made to dwell with You 
 And how I ache until I do 
 Holy God, Take my heart 
 Purge with flame and truth 
 A holy heart is all I want 
 That I may live with You

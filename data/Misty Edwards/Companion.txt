I hear him singing over you 
 He's singing over me 
 I'm right here, right where you left me 
 All this time, just patiently waiting 
 Not hard to find, I'm right where you left me 
 I'm right here 
 Right now, right now 
 I came into the garden 
 In the cool of the evening 
 Looking for a friendship 
 But where are you? 
 Just like in that garden 
 I cried out for Adam 
 I'm calling our your name 
 Right here, right now 
 Is anybody's listening 
 I want to be your companion 
 Just like in the garden 
 So if you're searching for Eden 
 Find it in me 
 Find it in me 
 I walk among the candlesticks 
 I walk among the churches 
 Searching for companionship, seeking you 
 Searching all the hearts of men 
 If anybody's loyal 
 I'm calling our your name 
 Right here, right now 
 I'm not so far away 
 I want to be your companion 
 Just like in the garden 
 So if you're searching for Eden 
 Find it in me 
 Find it in me 
 You are as close as conversation 
 You are so close to me 
 You are as near as turned attention 
 You are so near to me

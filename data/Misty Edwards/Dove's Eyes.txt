I don't want to talk about You 
 Like You're not in the room 
 I want to look right at You 
 I want to sing right to You 
 I believe You are listening 
 I believe that You move 
 At the sound of my voice 
 Give me dove's eyes 
 Give me undistracted devotion 
 For only You 
 I don't want to talk about You 
 Like You're not in the room 
 I want to look right at You 
 I want to sing right to You

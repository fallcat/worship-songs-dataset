Eternities 
 Eternity's eternal song, 
 Is drawing me away, it's calling me away 
 It's calling me away 
 All flesh is grass, fading away. 
 Only You last, only You remain 
 All flesh is grass, fading away. 
 Only You last, only You remain same, 
 You never change. 
 Holy, holy, holy, 
 You are fairer than then sons of men 
 Eternities 
 Eternity's eternal song, 
 Is drawing me away, it's calling me away 
 It's calling me away 
 Surely man is like the flower of the field, 
 And life is but a vapor, at best but a vapor. 
 Surely man is like a flower of the field, 
 And the fragrance but a vapor, at best but a vapor. 
 But you O God, 
 Are better than a thousand blooms. 
 Hallelujah, Amen! (x6)

 Eternity's eternal song,

Your steadfast love has captured My heart 
 Breaking through the years of My shame 
 You've quickly become the Lover of My soul 
 And I tell You it will always be the same 
 For I have set My heart toward You, Oh Lord 
 As I dwell in Your courts forevermore 
 Others call My name and beckon Me to come 
 Oh but I, I have eyes for only You 
 I will always have eyes for only You 
 I sing this song that all others may know 
 My heart is steadfast, never to be moved 
 Distractions worthy, Oh they fight for my desire 
 But my devotion will only be proved 
 "I am my Beloved's, Oh and He is mine" 
 These are the words that echo through My soul 
 "Oh how She loves Him" the Angels do say 
 Through the ages the story will be told 
 For I have set My heart toward You, Oh Lord 
 As I dwell in Your courts forevermore 
 Others call My name and beckon Me to come 
 Oh but I, I have eyes for only You 
 I will always have eyes for only You

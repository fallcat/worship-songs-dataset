All I want is You to have Your way 
 You are the Potter and I am the clay 
 All I need is You to have Your way 
 You are Creator and I am what You made 
 Finally I surrender 
 Finally I surrender 
 All I need is You to have Your way 
 You are Creator and I am what You made 
 Finally I surrender 
 Finally I surrender 
 You are God, I am man 
 You are sovereign

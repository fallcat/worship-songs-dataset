Awake, awake, oh north wind 
 Awake, awake, oh south wind; blow over me 
 Come, oh winds of testing 
 Come, winds of refreshing; blow over me 
 Let the winds blow, let the winds blow (7x) 
 Let the winds blow 
 Fling wide the door to my soul 
 Open up the door to my heart 
 Have your way, have your way 
 Have your way, yeah 
 I won't be afraid; I will face the wind 
 I won't be afraid; I'll embrace the flame 
 Let the winds blow, let the winds blow (7x) 
 Let the winds blow 
 Fling wide the door to my soul 
 Open up the door to my heart 
 Have your way, have your way 
 Have your way, yeah 
 Take me through the fire, take me through the rain 
 Take me through the testing, I'll do anything 
 Test me, try me, prove me, refine me like the gold 
 Like the gold

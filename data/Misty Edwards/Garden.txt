Here it's You and me alone, God 
 You and me alone 
 Here it's You and me alone, God 
 You and me alone 
 [I am Your resting place 
 For You said that You would be in me 
 That I would abide in the Vine 
 Christ in me 
 The hope of my glory] 
 You and me alone, God 
 You and me alone 
 Here it's You and me alone, God 
 You and me alone 
 You've hedged me in 
 With skin all around me 
 I'm a garden enclosed 
 A locked garden 
 Life takes place behind the face 
 Where it's You and me alone, God 
 Here it's You and me alone 
 Here it's You and me alone, God 
 You and me alone 
 So come into Your garden 
 Come into Your garden 
 Come into Your garden 
 Come into Your garden 
 Here, oh Lord 
 Have I prepared 
 A place for You 
 I'm no longer my own 
 I'm Your garden 
 I don't want to waste my life 
 Living on the outside 
 I'm going to live from the inside out 
 I don't want to waste my time 
 Living on the outside 
 I'm going to live from the inside out 
 I'm no longer my own 
 I'm Your garden 
 So come into Your garden 
 Come into Your garden 
 Come into Your garden 
 Come into Your garden!

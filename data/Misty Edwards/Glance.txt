I remember the first glance 
 I remember the first romance 
 I remember the first dance 
 When I fell in love with You 
 When I fell in love with You 
 When I fell in love... 
 I thought that I would never know love 
 And maybe I would never know touch 
 And then You came and awakened me 
 And then You came unlocking me 
 I've never known a love like this 
 You've shown the truth behind the myth 
 The mystery 
 I remember the first glance 
 I remember the first romance 
 I remember the first dance 
 When I fell in love with You 
 When I fell in love with You 
 When I fell in love... 
 When it's all been said 
 When it's all been done 
 When the race is run 
 And this life overcome 
 I will remember Your love 
 I will remember Your love 
 I will remember Your love 
 I will remember Your love 
 I remember the first glance 
 I remember the first romance 
 I remember the first dance 
 When I fell in love with You 
 When I fell in love with You 
 When I fell in love...

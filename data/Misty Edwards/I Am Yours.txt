Though I sleep 
 My heart is awake 
 Though it's night 
 On You I wait 
 It's been a long night 
 And I am weary 
 It's been a long time 
 And I am hungry 
 So I wait in the stillness again 
 And I wait in the quiet again 
 When I heard Your voice 
 When You said my name 
 When I heard Your voice 
 My heart it yearned 
 In the middle of the night 
 In the middle of the night 
 In the middle of the night 
 My heart it yearns 
 And though You're far away 
 Still I'm here to say 
 "I am Yours!" 
 "I am Yours!" 
 And when You feel so far away 
 Still I'm here to say 
 "I am Yours!" 
 "I am Yours!" 
 "I am Yours!" 
 "I am Yours!" 
 "I am Yours!" 
 "I am Yours!" 
 And I paid my vows 
 No turning around 
 I burned the bridges 
 They can't be found 
 When I heard Your voice 
 When You said my name 
 When I heard Your voice 
 My heart it yearned... for You 
 Though I sleep 
 My heart is awake 
 Though it's night 
 On You I wait 
 It's been a long night 
 And I am weary 
 It's been a long time 
 And I am hungry

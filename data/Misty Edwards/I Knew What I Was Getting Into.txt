I knew what I was getting into when I called you 
 I knew what I was getting into when I said your name, but I said it just the same 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still want you 
 I knew what I was getting into 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still chose you 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still want you 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still said Your name, I said it just the same 
 I knew what I was getting into 
 I am not shocked by your weakness 
 I am not shocked even by your sin 
 I am not shocked by your brokenness 
 I knew what I was getting into and I still want you 
 I knew what I was getting into and I still like you 
 I knew what I was getting into and I still chose you 
 Cause only I can see the end from the beginning 
 And only I can see where this is going 
 Only I can see the end from the beginning 
 And I see anew the seeds of love 
 And I see in you strength 
 When all you see is your failure 
 And all you feel is shame 
 I can see deeper than that 
 I know you better than, better than that 
 I knew what I was getting into when I called you 
 I knew what I was getting into when I said your name, I said it just the same 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still want you 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still like you 
 You're only at the beginning 
 You've only just begun 
 And I know where you are going 
 And all you can see is the moment that you're hurting 
 And all you can see is the moment that you're aching 
 But listen; 
 I knew what I was getting into when I called you 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still want you 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still like you 
 I knew what I was getting into, when I called you 
 Just don't give up 
 And don't give in 
 If you don't quit, you'll win, you'll win 
 Everything is in my hands 
 It's gonna be all right 
 Everything is in my hands 
 It's gonna be all right 
 It's gonna be okay 
 Everything is in my hands 
 It's gonna be all right 
 It's gonna be okay 
 And you don't have to pretend to be something or someone that you're not 
 'Cause I know you better than that 
 Even better, even better than that 
 Listen my beloved; 
 I knew what I was getting into when I called you 
 I knew what I was getting into when I said your name, I said it just to say 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still like you 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still chose you

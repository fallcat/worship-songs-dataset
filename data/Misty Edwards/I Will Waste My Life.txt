I will waste my life, 
 I'll be tested and tried. 
 With no regrets inside of me, 
 Just to find I'm at your feet, 
 Let me find I'm at your feet. 
 I leave my father's house, and 
 I leave my Mother. 
 I leave all I have known, and 
 I'll have no other. 
 For I am in love with you, 
 And there is no cost. 
 I am in love with you, 
 And there is no loss. 
 I am in love with you, 
 I want to take your name. 
 I am in love with you, 
 I want to cling to you, Jesus, 
 Just let me cling to you, Jesus. 
 I say goodbye to my father, my mother, 
 I turn my back on every other lover, and I 
 Press on, yes I press on. 
 I say goodbye to my father, my mother, 
 I turn my back on every other lover, and I press on, yes I press on. 
 For I am in love with you, 
 And there is no cost. 
 I am in love with you, 
 And there is no loss. 
 I am in love with you, 
 I want to take your name. 
 I am in love with you, 
 I want to cling to you, Jesus, 
 Just let me cling to you, Jesus, 
 I want to cling to you...

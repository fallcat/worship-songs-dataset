Can a woman forget her child 
 And have not compassion on the son of her womb? 
 Surely they may forget 
 But I will not forget you 
 No, I Will not forget you 
 Sing all you heaven, be joyful all the Earth 
 Break out in singing ah, you mountains 
 The Lord has comforted his people 
 And He will have mercy on his afflicted 
 He will have mercy on his afflicted 
 Though Zion has said "I've been forsaken" 
 Zion has said "I've been forgotten" 
 Zion has said "I've been forsaken" 
 Zion has said "I've been forgotten" 
 Can a woman forget her child 
 And have not compassion on the son of her womb? 
 Surely they may forget 
 But I will not forget you, my people 
 No, I will not forget you, oh Israel 
 I will not forget you! 
 See, I have inscribed you on the palm of My hands 
 Your walls are ever before Me 
 See, I have inscribed you on the palm of My hands 
 Your walls are ever before Me 
 And in that day you will no longer say 
 "Blessed be the Lord, our God who brought us from Egypt" 
 And in that day you will no longer say 
 "Blessed be the Lord, our God who parted the Red Sea" 
 For though I scattered, you I will gather you 
 Though I surround you with the nations 
 Can the axe boast against it's maker? 
 Why do the nations rage? 
 Vanity, vanity, ah vanities! 
 For in that day you will no longer say 
 "Blessed be the Lord, our God who parted the Red Sea" 
 Those who survive will find grace in the wilderness 
 To look upon the one who you have pierced 
 And in that day you will no longer say 
 "Blessed be the Lord, our God who parted the Red Sea" 
 For in that day you will say: 
 "Blessed be Yeshua HaMashiach" 
 For in that day my foot will stay upon the mount called olives 
 And the mount will split in two. 
 And there shall be a holy procession to Jerusalem 
 He has set free the captives and those condemned to die 
 Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna 
 Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna 
 King of kings and Lord of lords 
 Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! 
 It shall came to pass!

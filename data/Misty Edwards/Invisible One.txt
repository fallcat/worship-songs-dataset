Mysterious love 
 My eyes ache to see what my heart can't deny 
 You're my reality 
 Invisible touch 
 Intangible you 
 Pulled by your presence to light and truth 
 You're my gravity 
 You press in on me when I think that I'm alone 
 You're like my skin, my blood, my bone 
 Where can I go that you are not there? 
 You're all within me, you're everywhere 
 Visible things speak of the invisible 
 Transient beauty echoes transcendence 
 The mortal reflects immortality 
 The finite is part of infinite things 
 Even the sunrise declares you are there 
 You are not silent as men accuse 
 If were listening 
 You've placed in the heart of man 
 Undeniable evidence 
 That pulls them to you like a magnetic force 
 We are without excuse 
 Even the stars reverberate with the texture of your voice 
 My soul within me, an edgeless galaxy 
 Where only you are 
 Visible things speak of the invisible 
 Transient beauty echoes transcendence 
 The mortal reflects immortality 
 The finite is part of infinite things 
 Like empty capsules in the ocean 
 We are surrounded but far from you 
 The only access is through Jesus 
 To the experience of truth 
 Visible things speak of the invisible 
 Transient beauty echoes transcendence 
 The mortal reflects immortality 
 The finite is part of infinite things 
 'Cause there's more, yeah, there's more than meets the eye 
 There's more

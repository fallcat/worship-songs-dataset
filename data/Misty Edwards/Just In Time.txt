Like a rushing river am I 
 Like a raging torrent inside 
 I find that I'm full of knowing nothing 
 I find that I'm hungry for the fullness of Christ 
 Like a rushing river am I 
 Like a raging torrent inside 
 I find that I'm free falling again 
 I'm letting go of the mountain view, 
 Letting go, but what into 
 I've been crucified with Christ, 
 Crucified with Christ, I've been crucified with Christ 
 Yet not I, for one thing I know 
 You make ALL things beautiful (3x) 
 Just in time (2) 
 (Repeat from the beginning) 
 What is the length, what is the width, what is the depth, what is the height 
 (Repeat 2) 
 Who come comprehend? Who can enter in? (Repeat 2) 
 What is the length, what is the width, what is the depth, what is the height. 
 From glory to glory, 
 From death to life, life to death again 
 From strength to strength 
 Deep calls out to deep, Deep calls out to deep, Deep calls out to deep 
 As I press on!

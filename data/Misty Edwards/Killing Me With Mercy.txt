What are you doing Lord, kneeling in front of me? 
 I feel indignant Lord, that you'd ever wash my feet 
 I'll never let you see the dark and dirty 
 It's just too much for me 
 I know who you are, and I know where I have been 
 It offends me lord, that your knees are bent 
 I'd rather you be strong and make me pay 
 But this is too much for me 
 You're killing me with mercy, I can't breath 
 You're wrecking me with your kindness, I can't receive 
 What am I supposed to do with a God so humble? 
 It's breaking me 
 It's crushing me 
 I'd draw a sword for you, I said Id fight unto the death 
 I'd lose it all for you, I swore I'm not like the rest 
 But then the cock crows and I've let you down 
 I can't face you now I can't face you now 
 I'm a fragile stone, 
 I'm a vow that's broken, 
 I'm a rock that's crumbled at your feet 
 But you still want me 
 You say my love is real, though my love is weak 
 You still believe, the vows I make, I break, I make, I break 
 You still want me 
 You're killing me with mercy, I can't breath 
 You're wrecking me with your kindness, I can't receive 
 What am I supposed to do with a God so humble? 
 It's breaking me 
 I'll just believe 
 And let you love me

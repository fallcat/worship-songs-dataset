I'm in love with a Man 
 I'm in love with a Stranger 
 I'm in love with my Maker 
 Whom I have never seen 
 I'm in love with a Lamb 
 I'm in love with a Lion 
 I'm in love with my Savior 
 Whom I have yet to know 
 Oh, won't You let me love You more? 
 This is all that I desire 
 Won't You let me love You more 
 This is all that I require 
 Won't You let me love You more 
 This is my deepest heart's desire 
 Won't You let me love You more 
 Still more and more 
 For You could give to me the gift of walking on water 
 And maybe, maybe I will raise the dead 
 But I have one life to live 
 And all I have to give to You is love 
 I have one life to live 
 And all I have to give to You is love 
 And if I never walk on water 
 If I never see the miracles 
 If I never hear your voice so loud 
 Just knowing that You love me 
 Is enough to keep me here 
 Just hearing those words is enough 
 Is enough to satisfy 
 You do, You do 
 You satisfy 
 I couldn't leave even if a tried 
 I must have You 
 I must have You 
 I must have You 
 Oh, won't You let me love You more? 
 This is all that I desire 
 Won't You let me love You more 
 This is all that I require 
 Won't You let me love You more 
 This is my deepest heart's desire 
 Won't You let me love You more 
 Still more and more 
 When it's all been said 
 And when it's all been done 
 When the race is run 
 Well, it all comes down to love, love, love

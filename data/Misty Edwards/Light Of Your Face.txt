O Lord bless me and keep me 
 Cause Your face to shine on me 
 Lord be gracious 
 Lift the light of Your countenance 
 Give me peace 
 For I live only to see Your face 
 So shine on me 
 For I live only to see Your face 
 So shine on me 
 Let the light of Your face 
 Shine down on my heart 
 And let me feel it

Little girl, little girl with the big round eyes 
 Little bird, little bird, one day you'll fly 
 A breathtaking flight of life you'll fly 
 Then little bird, little bird, you will die 
 Because life, life is a vapor 
 But the brevity is what makes it a treasure 
 So feel it all like a love letter 
 To the one you will live with forever 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 His eye is on you 
 What then, what then when it's all over? 
 Little bones, little bones the dust will cover 
 Little spirit, little spirit you'll live on 
 With the soul of the bird that goes on and on 
 Then little bones, little bones 
 You will rise and little girl, little girl 
 You will fly 
 Fly

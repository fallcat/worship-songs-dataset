I am lovesick for my Beloved 
 My Beloved and my Friend 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Try as I may to chase another lover 
 I find there is, there is no other 
 For only You can satisfy 
 Only You can satisfy 
 And happy am I to live a hungry life 
 Blessed am I to thirst 
 Disillusionment 
 It is my gift within 
 I am blessed 
 I am blessed among men 
 To be lovesick for my beloved 
 My beloved and my friend 
 So very lovesick for my beloved 
 My beloved and my friend 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Try as I may to chase another lover 
 I find there is, there is no other 
 All the other Lovers fade away 
 All the other Lovers fade away 
 All the other Lovers fade away 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Only You can satisfy 
 And happy am I to live a hungry life 
 Blessed am I to thirst 
 My desire for you 
 It is my gift within 
 I am blessed 
 I am blessed among men 
 This is the generation that's tried everything 
 This is the generation of Jacob 
 This is the generation that's done all those things 
 But only You can satisfy 
 Only You can satisfy 
 This is the generation 
 Looking for the face of God 
 This is the generation of Jacob 
 This is the generation 
 Searching for the face of God 
 And only You can satisfy 
 Only You can satisfy

 We say, "Come!"

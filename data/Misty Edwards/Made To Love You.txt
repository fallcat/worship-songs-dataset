You have been so kind 
 So gentle, time after time 
 Of all of the years that I've come 
 You're still the one to whom I run 
 When everything changes 
 You remain the same 
 When all around, the world is shaken 
 You remain 
 You have been so kind 
 So gentle, time after time 
 Of all of the years that I've come 
 You're still the one to whom I run 
 When everything changes 
 You remain the same 
 When all around, the world is shaken 
 You remain 
 So Holy Spirit come, 
 How I long for your touch 
 I was made for the more 
 Than the things that so easily change 
 I was made to love You and be loved by You 
 I was made to love You and be loved by You

Mary was a little girl with navy blue eyes 
 Shattered too quickly with secrets and lies 
 Living in a small town where she felt claustrophobic 
 They dressed her in scarlet when she went out in public 
 Mary, Mary don't you know 
 You're the kind of heart and soul 
 He's always loved, he always will 
 Just keep on coming back to him 
 Mary grew up and outgrew the town 
 Left it in hopes of love never found 
 Two times a mistress, she felt like a harlot 
 Bittered with shame, she hated that scarlet 
 But Mary, Mary, don't you know humanity lives your story 
 We're all the same, the cowards the whores 
 Forgiven much, we love all the more 
 We love all the more, we love all the more 
 Mary met the young man with the ancient soul 
 Who spoke with his eyes and stopped the stone's throw 
 He silenced the voices that played in her head 
 Offered a new name and a husband instead 
 Then navy blue eyes 
 Like a stormy night ocean 
 Flooded with tears as the dam broke wide open 
 Like she'd be holding her breath since the day she'd been born 
 She inhaled for the first time 
 As secrets came bleeding down a face that was ashen 
 She felt his embrace and the strength to believe him 
 As the name of that young man crossed her cracked lips 
 He whispered forgiveness 
 And she loved all the more 
 She loved all the more 
 She loved all the more

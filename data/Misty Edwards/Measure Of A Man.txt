The measure of a man is the measure of his heart 
 The measure of a man is the measure of his love 
 The measure of a man is the measure of his heart 
 The measure of a man is the measure of his love 
 You don't measure me like man may see 
 You're looking at my heart, the core of me 
 Your eyes of fire see differently 
 Keep me in the gaze of love 
 The measure of a man is the measure of his heart 
 The measure of a man is the measure of his love 
 The measure of a man is the measure of his heart 
 The measure of a man is the measure of his love 
 When it's all been said, when it's all been done 
 When the race is run, well it all comes down to love 
 Did you learn to love? That's what You will ask of me 
 Did you learn to love? Not about my ministry 
 Did you learn to love? Not about my money 
 Did you learn to love? Did you learn to love?

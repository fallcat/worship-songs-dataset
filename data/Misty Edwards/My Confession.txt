I will follow the Lamb wherever He goes 
 Wherever He goes I will follow Him 
 There's only one way to the Father 
 There's only one truth 
 There's only one light in the darkness 
 He's not just a teacher 
 He's not one of many 
 He's the very Son of God 
 And I will follow Him 
 (I'll go down with Him)

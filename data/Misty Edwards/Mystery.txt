You're a mystery like poetry 
 Like a parable, a rhyme or a riddle 
 You're a mystery wrapped in clouds 
 Shouting so loud 
 Just waiting to be discovered 
 You're a mystery so intriguing 
 You're a mystery so inviting 
 You saved Yourself for the weak 
 The broken and the meek 
 Only the hungry dine 
 Only the thirsty drink deep 
 You saved Yourself for the needy 
 You saved Yourself for me 
 I want to waste my life 
 To search You out 
 Search You out 
 I want to waste my life 
 To search You out 
 Search You out 
 I don't want to build castles in the sand 
 I don't want to live in a fairy-tale 
 I want what's real 
 I will remain forever 
 Remain forever 
 It's the glory of God to hide a matter 
 It's the glory of a king to search it out 
 I wanna search You out 
 I love the way You hide 
 So I can find You 
 I wanna search You out

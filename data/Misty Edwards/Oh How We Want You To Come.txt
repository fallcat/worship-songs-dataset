Jesus look down from your Sanctuary high 
 Do not restrain the yearnings of Your heart 
 Your zeal, Your mercy, Your might 
 Rend the heavens and come down, come down, come down 
 And that the mountains would melt like wax 
 Jesus of Nazareth 
 A Jewish man 
 Son of David 
 Slain lamb 
 Return, return, return, return, return 
 You came as a baby 
 You were born in Bethlehem 
 Not just a prophet 
 You are You are the great I Am 
 Oh that You would come 
 Return to Your creation 
 King of Kings and Lord of Lords 
 Desire of the nations 
 Return, return, return 
 Oh how we want You to come 
 Oh how we want You to come 
 Oh how we want You to come 
 Oh how we want You to come 
 Just come 
 (Repeat) 
 It's not just revival that I'm yearning for

You will be my strength 
 You will be my song 
 You will be my light 
 All the whole night long 
 Worthy is the lamb 
 Blessed is the Lord who created you, 
 He who formed you in your mother's womb. 
 I have called you by your name, and you are Mine. 
 You are Mine. 
 When you pass through the waters, 
 I will be with you; through the rivers, 
 They will not overflow you. 
 When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. 
 You are Mine. 
 I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel. 
 You are precious in my sight. 
 Fear not, I am with you. You are Mine. 
 You will be my strength... 
 I want to be your witness, O God, to the end (to the end). 
 I know where I came from; I know where I am going. 
 My Father, He is God, and my Maker, 
 He is my Husband. eternity is my home. 
 His name is written on my forehead 
 And my name is written on the palm of His hand. 
 He is mine, and I am His. He is mine, and I am His. 
 So take my body if you please, and try, try and take all of me. 
 But my soul He keeps. my soul He keeps. 
 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
 The Lord, He is my Shepherd. 
 He is my Shepherd. 
 I am my Beloved's and He is mine. 
 Rightly do I love Him, 
 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow. 
 You will be my strength... (x2) 
 Worthy is the Lamb! 
 Though I walk through the valley, it's only a shadow, it's only a shadow! 
 Though my body may perish, it's only a shadow, it's only a shadow! 
 Though I walk through the valley, it's only a shadow, it's only a shadow! 
 Though my body may perish, it's only a shadow, it's only a shadow! 
 It's only a shadow! (repeats)

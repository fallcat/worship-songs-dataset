I can hear the rhythm 
 Of the Lion of the tribe of Judah 
 He's doing a new thing 
 So we're singing a new song 
 He's not a baby in a manger anymore 
 He's not a broken man on a cross 
 He didn't stay in the grave 
 And He's not staying in heaven forever! 
 He's alive 
 He's alive 
 He's alive 
 He's alive! 
 People get ready! 
 Jesus is coming! 
 We join in the song of the ages 
 It's a new song 
 It's a new song 
 It's a new song 
 We say to the One who was slain, 
 "You have proven Your love, 
 And You have shown us, shown us 
 That You can be trusted." 
 So take the scroll and open 
 And open, and open the seals 
 We trust You, Jesus 
 And we want you to come back 
 So take the scroll and open the seals 
 So take the scroll and open the seals 
 I can hear the rhythm 
 Of the Lion of the tribe of Judah 
 He's doing a new thing 
 So we're singing a new song 
 He's not a baby in a manger anymore 
 He's not a broken man on a cross 
 He didn't stay in the grave 
 And He's not staying in heaven forever! 
 He's alive 
 He's alive 
 He's alive 
 He's alive! 
 People get ready! 
 Jesus is coming! 
 People walking around 
 With their fingers in the their ears 
 Singing, "Da da da da da." 
 "I don't want to hear the sound of the coming King." 
 But He says, he says, 
 "Well, I have held my peace for 
 A long, long, long, long time 
 And in my silence you thought 
 That I was all together like you. 
 And in your heart you were settled in complacency 
 You said, 'He won't even respond.' 
 You said, 'He's not interested." 
 You said, 'He's dead and gone." 
 But I've been silent for such 
 A long, long, long, long time 
 But I'm about to gasp, to pant, 
 To cry out, to cry out, 
 I'm going to shout!" 
 Once again I'm going to shake 
 Everything that can be shaken 
 Once again I'm going to break 
 Everything that can be broken 
 Are you ready? 
 Are you ready for this? 
 Are you ready? 
 Are you ready? 
 People get ready! 
 Jesus is coming! 
 He's coming! 
 He's coming! 
 He's coming! 
 He's coming!

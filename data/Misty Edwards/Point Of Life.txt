Remember now your creator 
 In the days of youth 
 Remember now your creator 
 Before the silver cord is loosed 
 For flesh will return to the darkness 
 The spirit will return to God 
 For all men go to eternity 
 And their mourners mourn in the street 
 But there's more to life than just vanity 
 I can see 
 Knowing You is the answer to 
 The riddle of the point of life 
 The point of life is You 
 It's You 
 Loving you is the reason 
 That I'm breathing 
 It's the absolute 
 The point of life is You 
 It's you 
 Men live lives of futility 
 Forgetting where they began 
 Men live lives of fragility 
 Not knowing where they end 
 Yet all men die in the end 
 But the end is where they begin 
 For all men go to eternity 
 And their mourners mourn in the street 
 Yet there's more to life than just vanity 
 I can see 
 I can see that 
 Knowing You is the answer to 
 The riddle of the point of life 
 The point of life is You 
 It's You 
 Loving You is the reason 
 That I am breathing 
 It's the absolute 
 The point of life is you 
 It's you 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I want to love you with all I am 
 I'll love my brother and loving You 
 Cause it all comes down to love

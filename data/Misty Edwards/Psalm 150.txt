Praise God in His sanctuary 
 Praise Him in the expanse of heaven 
 Praise Him for His mighty acts 
 Praise Him according to His excellence 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise God with the sound of the trumpet 
 Praise Him with the harp and lyre 
 Praise Him with the timbrel and dance 
 Praise Him with stringed instruments 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise God with the clashing cymbal 
 Praise Him with the singing flute 
 Let everything that has breath 
 Let us never cease to praise 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord

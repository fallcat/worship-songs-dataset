When You cry, I want to cry with You 
 When You laugh, let me feel joy 
 When You move, I want to move with You 
 When You're still, keep my feet on the ground 
 For without You I can do nothing 
 To be with You is my greatest dream 
 To be without You I would have nothing 
 So keep me near You now and always 
 Show me what You are doing 
 I want to be near You as Your friend 
 Tell me Your deepest secrets 
 I want to know You, put Your heart in me 
 When You pray, I want to pray with You 
 When You heal, Lord, use my hands 
 When moved with compassion, turn within me 
 When seasons change, let me in on Your plan 
 For Your Spirit lives within me 
 And Your heartbeat He will unveil 
 Your very mind has been placed within me 
 So clear the gray and let me enter in 
 Show me what You're doing 
 I want to be near You as a friend 
 Tell me Your deepest secrets 
 I want to know You, put Your heart in me 
 Show me what You're doing 
 I want to be near You as Your friend 
 Tell me Your deepest secrets 
 I want to know You, put Your heart in me 
 I want to know You, put Your heart in me 
 I want to love You, put Your heart in me 
 Let me hear Your heartbeat, let me hear what You feel 
 Let me hear Your heartbeat, let me hear what You feel

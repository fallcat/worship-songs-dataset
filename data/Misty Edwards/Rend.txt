Oh that You would rend the heavens 
 Oh that You would rend the heavens 
 Oh that You would rend the heavens 
 And come down 
 We miss You, Jesus 
 And we want You to return 
 We are lovesick, Jesus 
 We just want You to come back 
 For the Spirit and the Bride say "come" 
 For the Spirit and the Bride say "come" 
 Oh that You would rend the heavens 
 Oh that You would rend the heavens 
 Oh that You would rend the heavens 
 And come down 
 And come down, just come down 
 And come down, just come down 
 For You're the only solution 
 You're the only resolution

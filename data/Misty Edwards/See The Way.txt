See the way He holds 
 The stars in His hands 
 See the way He holds my heart 
 Just one word of Your mouth were the heavens made 
 Just one breathe of Your lips the foundation were laid 
 Just one dream in Your thoughts 
 You have wanted me 
 Just one pulse of Your heart 
 You are wooing me 
 See the way He holds 
 The stars in His hands 
 See the way He holds my heart 
 Just one word of Your mouth were the heavens made 
 Just one breathe of Your lips the foundation were laid 
 Just one dream in Your thoughts 
 You have wanted me 
 Just one pulse of Your heart 
 You are wooing me 
 See the way He holds 
 The stars in His hands 
 See the way He holds my heart 
 For God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 So He fashioned me 
 God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 So He formed my heart 
 God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 So He fashioned me 
 God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 With just one pulse of Your heart 
 With just one pulse of Your heart 
 With just one pulse of Your heart 
 I'm in love! 
 See the way He holds 
 The stars in His hands 
 See the way He holds my heart 
 For God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 So He fashioned me 
 God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 So He formed my heart 
 God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 So He fashioned me 
 God is a Lover looking for a lover 
 With just one pulse of Your heart 
 With just one pulse of Your heart 
 With just one pulse of Your heart 
 I'm in love! 
 I'm in love! 
 I'm in love! 
 There's nothing like You and I 
 There's nothing like You and I 
 There's nothing like You and I 
 There's nothing like You and I 
 See the way He holds 
 The stars in His hands 
 See the way He holds my heart

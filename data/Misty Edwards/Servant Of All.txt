I wanna be Your lover 
 Show me how to go lower 
 For in the depths I will find You 
 Where You're serving my brother 
 I wanna be with You where You are 
 I wanna be with You where You are 
 I wanna be with You where You are 
 You're the servant of all 
 I'm in love with a king who became a slave 
 I'm in love with a God who is humble 
 Cause you gotta go down if you wanna go up 
 And You've gotta go lower 
 If you wanna go higher and higher 
 You've gotta hide and do it in secret 
 If you wanna be seen by God 
 It's the inside-outside 
 Upside-down kingdom 
 Where you lose to gain 
 And you die to live

Once condemned to fear of death 
 We were bound by life's short breath 
 With enmity between God and man 
 Hopelessly we were condemned 
 Jesus, You're the firstborn from the dead 
 You're the life and the resurrection 
 You made a way for all men 
 Who die, to rise again 
 Knowing you, is life eternal 
 Both now and forever 
 We will shine like the stars 
 We will live after we die 
 For when You appear, then we will appear 
 As You live, we will live 
 Forever one 
 You're the first among many 
 In the kingdom of love

Over and over and over and over again 
 I will stir up my soul to lay hold of You 
 Over and over and over and over again 
 I will stir up my soul to lay hold of 
 That which I cannot comprehend 
 Over and over and over and over again 
 Over and over and over and over again 
 And then I'll just lean into sovereignty 
 I'll embrace a mystery 
 And I'll just rest in You 
 As I bathe in truth 
 Over and over and over and over again 
 This is my simple devotion 
 My walk of faith, day by day 
 Over and over and over and over again 
 And then I hear You say 
 As You gaze over the balcony of heaven 
 I hear You say as You peer through the lattice of time 
 I hear You say as You stand in heaven 
 I hear You say as You rejoice over me 
 "O Angels! O Angels! Look and see! 
 Through that dark night of faith 
 She is gazing at Me! 
 O Angels! O Angels! Look and see! 
 Through that cloud of unknowing 
 She's gazing at Me! 
 And You have ravished My heart 
 My sister, My bride 
 With one glance of your eye! " 
 Over and over and over and over again... "

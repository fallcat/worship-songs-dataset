As the deer pants for the water, my soul longs for You 
 As the body dies without water, my soul dies without You 
 They may say, "Come on, get over it. Drink, be merry, for tomorrow we die" 
 That's why I'd rather sit in the house of mourning than at the table with fools 
 Blessed are the hungry-You said it, I believe it 
 Hunger is an escort into the deeper things of You 
 You satisfy, you satisfy 
 My soul cries, my soul cries, my soul cries for You 
 Take me to the place where You satisfy, take me to the river 
 I'll do anything, God; there is no price, take me to the river 
 They may say, "Come on, get over it, everything is okay" 
 They may say, "Why the hunger? Why the thirsting? Why the mourning?" 
 But my soul cries, my soul cries 
 All my tears You hold in a bottle; You will pour them out like rain 
 Weeping endures for the night, for the night 
 But joy comes in the morning, joy comes in the morning 
 Blessed are the hungry, blessed are the thirsty 
 You said it, I believe it; I believe it, I believe it 
 Hunger is the escort into the deeper things of You 
 Deep is calling out to deep is calling out to deep 
 Yesterday's depth is feeling really shallow 
 I've gotta go deeper, deeper, deeper still 
 And all Your waves and all Your billows crash over me 
 Pulling me deep, deep, deeper 
 From glory to glory, from strength to strength, from depth to depth 
 I want to fellowship with You 
 You're not so far away, it's not too mysterious 
 You're living on the inside of me, Your Spirit on the inside of me 
 Spring up, O well; spring up, O well; spring up, O well, within me

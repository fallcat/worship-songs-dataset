To You, O Lord, I cry out 
 For Your arrows pierce me deeply, deeply 
 For Your hand is heavy on me 
 Because of my sin 
 But Lord keep me, keep me, keep me 
 I am in trouble, I am in trouble 
 My iniquity is over my head 
 My flesh is weary from convictions convincing 
 And I have been weeping all night in my bed 
 It's the sound of a heart crying out to God 
 And the sound of His heart calling back to you 
 It's the sound of a heart crying out to God 
 And the sound of His heart calling back to you 
 All of my tears You hold in Your bottle 
 Like a sentimental thing 
 My tears of repentance You hold like a treasure 
 Like a sweet offering 
 All of my sighing reaches Your ears 
 You know that I love You 
 So help me, help me, God 
 And the lonely You will comfort 
 And the broken You will heal 
 All my sighing reaches Your ear

I want to play the strings of Your heart, God 
 Come play the strings of mine 
 I want to sing straight to Your heart, God 
 Come sing straight to mine 
 You have my heart 
 Lord, You have my heart 
 Lord, You have my heart 
 And I am searching for Yours 
 Lord, You have my thoughts 
 Lord, You have my thoughts 
 Lord, You have my thoughts 
 And I am searching for Yours 
 Lord, You have my song 
 Lord, You have my song 
 Lord, You have my song 
 And I am searching for Yours 
 I'm so in love with You 
 I'm so in love with You 
 I'm so in love with You, Jesus 
 I'm so in love with You 
 I'm so in love with You 
 I'm so in love with You, Jesus 
 I'm so in love with You 
 I'm so in love with You 
 I'm so in love with You 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

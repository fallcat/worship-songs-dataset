Summer girl you were born with the sun in your heart 
 All you wanted from the start, you wanted love 
 When all the boys talked of conquering the fortune game 
 You just remained the same, you wanted love 
 But love was evasive and hard to grasp 
 Romance a fairy tale that never lasts 
 Winter came and you felt the cold of abandonment 
 As darkness drove out sunshine rays, you still wanted love 
 As lovers plot against the chords that brought them there 
 Traitor up and left you there but he just wanted love 
 Love is evasive and hard to grasp 
 Romance a fairy tale that never lasts 
 But baby girls with your eyes and funny ways 
 Prove to all it's not in vain but love is real 
 Life is not what we thought in teenage dreams 
 But you're stronger than those childhood games 
 Just don't give up 
 Love is in living and moving on 
 The tapestry of perfected love 
 Of pain and glory, it's woven of 
 Beautiful threads of gold divine 
 A love that lasts not the fading kind 
 There's a love that lasts, not the fading kind

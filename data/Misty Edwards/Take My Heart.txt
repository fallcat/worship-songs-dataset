For a long time I have waited for You 
 You have won my heart 
 I am following 
 For a long time I've been crying out for You 
 Tears make my heart soft I am ready for 
 The return of the Lover, the return of the Lover 
 Fashioned from the very fabric of God 
 At the start of time, set free to decide 
 I will love You, You're the One who loved me first 
 Just one look from Your eye, I'm captivated by 
 The eyes of the Lover, the eyes of the Lover 
 Take my heart, my mind and strength too 
 I was made for loving You 
 I will wait 
 I'll be faithful 
 I was made for loving You

Can't pretend that I am blind 
 Can't go back and erase the mind 
 Naivety and wide-eyed wonder are far from me 
 But at least now I see 
 It's like I'm walking on a tightrope 
 Stretched across the universe 
 Way too high to go back from where I came 
 Overwhelmed at the miles I've yet to tame 
 I'm too far in to turn around now 
 And I've got too far to go to sit down now 
 Too far in, too far to go 
 Surrounded by blackness mingled with stars 
 Keeping a sacred balance hoping I don't fall 
 Don't want to fall, don't want to walk 
 Want to disappear like cowards talk 
 No, no, no, no, no 
 Hanging there in space my toes gripping the rope 
 It's the only hope 
 That golden thread that got me here 
 Will be the same 
 That brings me to the end 
 I know, I know you're with me 
 You surround me, you surround me 
 Your invisible hand is around, around 
 In this uncomfortable in-between 
 Where I'm too far in to turn around now

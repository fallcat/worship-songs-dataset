Until the day breaks 
 Until the share free way 
 I will go my way 
 To the mountains 
 I will sing the songs 
 That awaken the dawn 
 And I will usher in Your appearing 
 It is Your face that I crave 
 And it's Your presence that I long for 
 Your kingdom come 
 And when you're still upon my heart 
 Stronger than the grave 
 Set me Ablaze 
 And from the ends of the Earth 
 We hear this song... 
 Glory to the Righteous One! 
 And Espirit and Bride say come

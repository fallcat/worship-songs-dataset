I've paid my vows right here right now 
 No matter what comes my way (2x) 
 I do love You, I do love You, I do love You 
 You know that I love You, Jesus (2x) 
 For every season there's a reason 
 And a purpose under heaven 
 This I know, this I know 
 A time to laugh and a time to cry 
 A time to live and a time to die 
 A time to speak a time for silence 
 A time to gain and a time to lose 
 A time to mourn and a time to dance 
 A time for peace and a time for war 
 Through every season of the soul 
 Through every season of Your love 
 Through every season in this life 
 I want You to know 
 I do love You, I do love You, I do love You 
 You know that I love You, Jesus

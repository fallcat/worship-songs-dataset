I'll take my cold, cold heart 
 I'll take my unrenewed mind 
 I'll take Your Word in my hand 
 And then I'll give You time 
 To come and melt me 
 I can't even love You unless You call my name 
 I can't even worship unless You anoint my heart, God 
 I can't even want You unless You want me first 
 Come fan the flame, oh 
 Come fan the flame, yeah 
 I'll take my cold, cold heart 
 I'll take my unrenewed mind 
 I'll take Your Word in my hand 
 And then I'll give You time 
 To come and melt me 
 I can't even love You unless You call my name 
 I can't even worship unless You anoint my heart, God 
 I can't even want You unless You want me first 
 Come fan the flame, oh 
 Come fan the flame, yeah 
 Do what only You can do 
 Come fan the flame 
 Do what only You can do 
 Come fan the flame 
 Do what only You can do 
 Come fan the flame 
 Do what only You can do 
 Just let my heart be alive 
 Let me be living deep 
 Deep on the inside 
 Come fan the flame 
 Hey, hey, yeah

 Do what only You can do 
 Come fan the flame 
 Do what only You can do 
 Just let my heart be alive 
 Let me be living deep 
 Deep on the inside

When You think of me 
 When You hear my name 
 When You see my face 
 Let it be mercy 
 When thoughts of me come to Your memory 
 Oh my story told 
 Let it be mercy 
 Don't remember me according to my sin 
 But remember me with compassion 
 When my voice is heard around Your throne 
 Let it strike Your heart with love alone 
 When You think of me 
 When You hear my name 
 When You see my face 
 Let it be mercy 
 When thoughts of me come to Your memory 
 Oh my story told 
 Let it be mercy 
 When I stand face to face and look You in the eyes 
 See my heart, see my soul and how I fought the fight 
 Blot out my sin when You look at me 
 Let my life be a treasured memory 
 When You think of me 
 When You hear my name 
 When You see my face 
 Let it be mercy 
 When thoughts of me come to Your memory 
 Oh my story told 
 Let it be mercy

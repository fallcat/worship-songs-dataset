It's like were sitting in the dark and we don't know it 
 Like were hidden behind a veil and we don't know it 
 Just like a baby in the womb 
 They don't know there's more 
 There's more than just the darkness 
 Just like that baby in the womb 
 Forming fingers and toes 
 The hand of the potter 
 Is forming and molding 
 It's like were sitting in the dark and we don't know it

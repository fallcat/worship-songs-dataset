You won't relent until You have it all 
 My heart is Yours 
 I'll set You as a seal upon my heart 
 As a seal upon my arm 
 For there is love that is as strong as death 
 Jealousy demanding as the grave 
 Many waters cannot quench this love 
 Come be the fire inside of me 
 Come be the flame upon my heart 
 Come be the fire inside of me 
 Until You and I are one

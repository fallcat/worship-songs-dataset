An old man was standing on the hill and he saw a strange ship coming from the west... 
 "Those visitors aren't coming in peace, so let them die in our sea..." 
 The power of our shaman scared them to death... 
 The power of our shaman comes from the heart of nature... 
 Now it's dark and you can only hear screaming, they scare our mighty-men, who are as hard as iron. 
 In the name of our mighty god of thunder... 
 "Ukko... Ylijumala... Anna voimasi virrata..."

Now I have to go to the great, final war and I will die, 
 But my spirit still goes on... 
 Fight with death, don't lose your will. 
 If you win or die you're a legend... 
 Death is like a spell... 
 You can't resist... 
 Now I'm cold, but a ghost lives in my veins. 
 Death has won and it will return again...

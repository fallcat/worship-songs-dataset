Are you dead! 
 Hundreds of orcs without heads... 
 The troops of Saruman are dead... dead! 
 The army of Isengard was strong... 
 But Rohirrim with the trees, they won... 
 Broken shields, crushed skulls, the smell of blood... 
 Oh yeah! 
 After the battle we'll celebrate... 
 After the battle we'll bang our heads...

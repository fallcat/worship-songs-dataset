In the course of time, it was forgotten. 
 This ancient crypt slept, there was peace. 
 But then somebody disturbed those sleeping demons, and the seal of the crypt was broken... 
 And an evil laugh resounds from there at night. 
 This ancient crypt started the immortal rites... 
 Old legends became true, darkness was there soon. 
 Passing bells sing their song, the whole area is now only illusion...

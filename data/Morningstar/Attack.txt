Raise the horn, raise the axe... 
 Call your gods, don't look back. 
 Do the sign, forget the fear... 
 For Turisas you will bleed... 
 To the battle I ride. 
 For the last time... 
 I have no fear, I lost my mind... 
 Now it's time to attack! 
 Go ahead, make my day. 
 Soon you'll be dead and I'll follow my gods. 
 To the battle I ride. 
 For the last time... 
 I have no fear, I lost my mind... 
 Now it's time to attack!

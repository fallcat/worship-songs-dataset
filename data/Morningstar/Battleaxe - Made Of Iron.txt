Like a battleaxe... 
 Like a hammer of war... 
 Harder than the rocks 
 Of this once mystical land... 
 The coming of Christ... 
 The old ways lost... 
 But the fire still burns. 
 In the night of Pohjola... 
 I can stand the wind and the rain... 
 I can crush the mountains in my way 'cause I'm made of iron... 
 In the night, the northstar is shining bright. 
 Since the dawn of time... 
 I can stand the wind and the rain... 
 I can crush the mountains in my way 'cause I'm made of iron...

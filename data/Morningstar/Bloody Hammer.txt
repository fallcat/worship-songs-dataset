Now, Thor calls me and I must go to the war, 
 "Take your hammer, take your ringshirt, the dragonship is waiting for you." 
 I kiss my wife (maybe the last time), I'll never come back home. 
 The ship leaves the village and disappears into the fog... 
 My mind is cold as a frost. 
 But many of them will never come back from the raw, bloody war... 
 They're heroes, they gave their lives. 
 I don't fear anymore... 
 They fight for Thor, they fight for Odin, they fight for their brave souls. 
 The amulet of hammer gives the power to crush the enemies' heads with bloody hammer... 
 "Leave your ship to the dark shore... Show no mercy to the enemy." 
 "Time has come to go and attack, time has come to kill or die..."

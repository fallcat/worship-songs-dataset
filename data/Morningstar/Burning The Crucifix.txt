Across the sea they came with their ceremonies... 
 They started to enslave northern people with christianity... 
 Cruelty and pain came with them and those intruders started to rule with swords and in the name of their morbid god... 
 The priest started to baptise people... 
 Against their own will... 
 Those who refused were sentenced to death... 
 Passionate killers, servants of Jesus Christ... 
 Carried their symbol, the cross of their rotting Christ... 
 But in the night we burnt the cross and everyone of us were into "burning the crucifix..."

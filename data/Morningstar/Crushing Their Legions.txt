It was a black night when the legions of Olav the Holy arrived... 
 They wanted to burn our houses, they wanted to rape our women... 
 But they failed... They died. 
 We created a thunderstorm with our spells, it's our mighty force. 
 Their ships were crushed by the lightnings... 
 Their men died in our shore... 
 Warriors of northern tribe showed who's the king of this battle...

The child was born evil, Kullervo was his name... 
 They tried to drown him, they tried to burn him, 
 They tried to hang him, but he couldn't be killed... 
 He was a slave and he killed a child 
 By cutting an arm and by destroying an eye... 
 He burned the forest and turned the cattle into beasts 
 And caused the death of the Northern Maid... 
 He ran away and found his relatives... 
 But life didn't go well... 
 He became more evil and was cursed by his father, 
 He cursed himself, but was loved by his mother... 
 He killed Untamo and all his relatives, 
 Vengeance was done and he was alone again... 
 He went away and asked of his sword: 
 "Would you like to drink my blood?" 
 And then he threw himself upon the sword... yeah!

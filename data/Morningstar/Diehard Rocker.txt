My axe spits fire... 
 I've made an oath for the desire of rock 
 I'm not a rich man, but I'm a rocker, 
 There are things that money can't buy... 
 Come to the stage, sing with us again... 
 I've always been a diehard rocker, 
 Since I found rock'n roll... 
 I've always been a diehard rocker, 
 Since I found metal rock... 
 My amps are made in hell, 
 Manufactured by the devil himself... 
 People say I'm evil, but I'm a rocker... 
 True metal comes from the underground... 
 Come to the stage, sing with us again... 
 I've always been a diehard rocker, 
 Since I found rock'n roll... 
 I've always been a diehard rocker, 
 Since I found metal rock...

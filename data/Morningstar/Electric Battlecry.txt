My eyes have seen the destruction, we are doomed to live in this hell... 
 People don't know what they've done, bastards will rule and curse the sun. 
 We must kill the kings and start to play louder to the world. 
 Armies of metal will kill with their music, electric axes will ruin your castles. 
 The sound of the strings is our battlecry, justice will win in the end!

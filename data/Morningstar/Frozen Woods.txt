Hold your breath and prepare to attack... 
 Nobody knows we're here in the woods... 
 The eyes of an owl are watching our way. 
 Through the cold mist and frost... 
 Fifty men ready to fight, no return... 
 We fight the east, we fight the west. 
 We can raise a storm and thunder. 
 With the help of our own god... 
 We come from the frozen woods... 
 The last place on earth for a man. 
 To be free...

I... I'm the master of this war plan and I rule this land with my iron hand. 
 Now listen, I came from the northern land called Suomi, the land of the crazy men. 
 I'm a warrior, I'm a crazy Finn. 
 I'll burn your land. 
 Together we ride across the middle Europe. 
 This isn't my fight but who cares... let's march on! 
 Hakkaa päälle!

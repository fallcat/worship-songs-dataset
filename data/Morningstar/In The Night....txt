In the night I burn a big bonfire 
 And I hail to the dead... the ones I loved 
 I'm crying in a hailstorm and I curse the life 
 I can't help it, when the feeling comes... 
 In the night... 
 I have made my way through the storms... 
 I have used my strength to survive... 
 I have paid my respects to the gods of nature... 
 I have bled for you, but now you're gone, 
 No-one can hear my longing... 
 In the night...

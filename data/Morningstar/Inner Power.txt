The power is inside of us... 
 If you breathe right, you can feel it 
 When the colors are balanced, 
 The power will flow free... 
 Can you feel it inside of you? 
 It's running through your meridians... 
 The energy is like lightning, 
 When you learn to know yourself... 
 There's energy in you and me, 
 There's no life without it... 
 Can you feel it inside of you? 
 It's running through your meridians... 
 The energy is like lightning, 
 When you learn to know yourself...

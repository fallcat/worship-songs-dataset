Can you feel the flame inside your brain? 
 It's a fever that never stops... 
 Heavy metal strings will always live. 
 In our minds, in our hearts... 
 Oh gods... raise the metal fever! 
 Raise the metal fever! 
 Still unknown, still dangerous... 
 Warriors of underground. 
 We'll never give up, we're a spike in your flesh. 
 We're men from the other side... 
 Oh gods... raise the metal fever! 
 Raise the metal fever! 
 Raise the metal fever!

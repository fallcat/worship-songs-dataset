To the mountain of glass 
 She used to fly at night 
 She told me stories about Blåkulla 
 A sabbath was held on Walpurgis' night, yeah! 
 She was a witch from Kyöpeli 
 She was a victim of Christianity 
 She was burned at stake 
 Despite all the horrors she did 
 I've still loved her for all these years 
 She must have made a love potion 
 Brewed and bottled in Kyöpeli 
 She was a witch from Kyöpeli 
 She was a victim of Christianity 
 She was burned at stake

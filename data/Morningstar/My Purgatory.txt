My life is like a living hell, I'm alone now until the end. 
 My friends betrayed me, but I'm not desperate, if you play with me, you'll lose your breath. 
 No one understands me, I live in shadows, you can't see... 
 Pain, love, hate are my purgatory... 
 I'll never change my way, this is the path I want to go. 
 Through the darkness, to the gate...

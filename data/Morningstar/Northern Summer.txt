Now it's over again, so short you are, so much light you bring... 
 The green woods, the lakes of my childhood. 
 Are my shield against the modern age... 
 Oh my brothers, my sisters raise your heads. 
 Enjoy this period, be proud, be happy. 
 Hail to your ancestors... 
 Now, my life is ending and I have to go to Manala... 
 It's not heaven, it's not hell and my memory will live on and on...

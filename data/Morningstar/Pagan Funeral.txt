Now he has gone... 
 Our father, your ancestor. 
 Sword and shield by his side, he will disappear from this world... From the mortal world! 
 Everybody is still, do not disturb. 
 The spirit of the dead. 
 Beware the beast, defend the dead or he... 
 ...Will become a restless ghost. 
 A pile of stones, a grave among rocks 
 Is his home from now on... 
 Black clouds in the sky... 
 God of thunder shows his might... 
 A perfect day to die... 
 The spirit lies with the wind, with a stormwind! 
 Everybody is still, do not disturb. 
 The spirit of the dead. 
 Beware the beast, defend the dead or he... 
 ...Will become a restless ghost.

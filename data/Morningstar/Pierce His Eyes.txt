I was a prisoner and you wanted to hear my story... 
 But I won't tell you, even if you'll torture me to death... 
 "Pierce his eyes..." 
 Pain was awful, I can't stand it. 
 Soon I'll break down, but I'll take my life with me... 
 "Pierce his eyes..." 
 I'm so lonely, I don't feel pain anymore and I can see myself from above... 
 Now I understand that I don't live anymore... 
 I've lost my live, only death is real!

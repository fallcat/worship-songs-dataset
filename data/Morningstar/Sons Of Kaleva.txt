Under the northstar we were born... 
 Gods of nature will guide our way. 
 Through the evil, insane world... 
 Strong as the sons of Kaleva. 
 We'll stay alive, choose our side... 
 I believe that some day... 
 When the world is gone... 
 We'll still be here in the North, our spirits will become 
 One with the land... 
 Strong as the sons of Kaleva. 
 We'll stay alive, choose our side...

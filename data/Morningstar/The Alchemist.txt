I must find the key to open all the secrets. 
 Iron will turn to gold, it's a step I have to take. 
 Oh higher forces... 
 Oh demons of hell... 
 Help me in my search for immortality. 
 I made a deal with Satan. 
 The smell of hell comes from my mouth. 
 Now I stand inside the circle of pentagram with magic tricks I entertain my friends.

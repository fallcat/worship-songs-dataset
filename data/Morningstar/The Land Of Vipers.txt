A land in the north... beyond the Baltic sea 
 A land of northern lights... a land of the free 
 Eastern trolls, Western Christians... 
 Are always trying to conquer our land... 
 But they died by the venom (of vipers) 
 And they cried in pain... 
 Stormy weather, the lethal snakebites... 
 And the hostile tribes... This is the land of vipers 
 Eastern trolls, Western Christians... 
 Are always trying to conquer our land... 
 But they died by the venom (of vipers) 
 And they cried in pain...

You came to the throne. 
 You promised to male our world. 
 A better place to live... 
 But you've done mistakes. 
 And you've changed our lives. 
 Even worse and we will die... 
 You used your power so hard, your spells will kill the dawn. 
 Throne of wisdom has become. 
 A throne of doom. 
 And it's your fault... 
 But I'll fight till death... Yeah! 
 Maybe some day this tragedy will end. 
 Throne of doom is not unbroken, but it will always be. 
 In a form of religion.

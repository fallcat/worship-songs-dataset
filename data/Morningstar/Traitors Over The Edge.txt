Against the evil forces of the crown. 
 Our army will march. 
 We found some enemies behind our backs. 
 We put them under the ice, they deserve to die with halberd in my hand. 
 I pushed them over the edge. 
 Better to die by the sword than be hanged. 
 This is our last chance, so there's no use for the traitors. 
 And the cruel decision must be done, there's no turning back anymore.

I'm watching when the horizon tries to swallow the sun... 
 I'm waiting for the black angel, she must come before the dark... 
 Oh, when I'll see the morninglight, thoughts screamed in my mind, the birds sing very nice... 
 (This is the...) 
 Twilight of the paradise. 
 Then the angel came and she told me about her life... 
 Her words were so beautiful that even the stars came to her side...

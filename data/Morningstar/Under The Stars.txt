I'm just watching the stars and you're in my mind... 
 You left me alone to this cold world... 
 The pain inside my heart, the nightmares in my dreams... there's no one like you... 
 Only a fool will fall in love, 
 But this happened to me, is there any way out? 
 Under the stars I cry... 
 Under the stars I die...

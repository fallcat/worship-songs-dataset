I can't sleep tonight, there's something wrong and I don't know what it is... 
 Then I begin to remember... 
 My grandma was murdered last fall... 
 "You did it", they said. 
 I know, I saw a dream last night... 
 And she wants to take me away, she's a visitor from death... 
 I feel something inside my room... 
 A cold breath near my spine... 
 Grandma is standing in front of me, I begin to scream... 
 "You did it", she says. 
 She comes to me and I can't escape... 
 Her rotten hand is rising... 
 "Now you'll die", she says. 
 "We'll go, together, to hades..."

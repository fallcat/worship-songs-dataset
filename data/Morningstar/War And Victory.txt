The men of the church have found me... but I spit to the cross and fight... 
 I'm a heretic and I'm proud of it, freedom is in my blood... 
 War and victory! 
 From the west came a priest and he brought a message with disease... 
 My shining blade will cut his head and the hunting starts again... 
 War and victory!

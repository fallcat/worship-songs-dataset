Wild wind came from the north. 
 Brave men with bloody swords 
 Came here to fight by your side 
 Like a thunderstorm we ride in the sky... 
 We're the warriors of pagan gods, 
 Northern power lives in our hearts, 
 Valhalla is our fate. 
 After death we'll still celebrate 
 ...We're the warriors of pagan god...

I'm searching for the cycle of life, 
 There's no god in the sky... 
 There are five elemental energies in us, 
 We're like a tree without roots and a crown... 
 Wood, fire, earth, water... and metal 
 Are the elements of life... 
 Have you ever thought of what will happen when we die? 
 The energy will change its form

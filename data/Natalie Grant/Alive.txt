Who but You 
 Could breathe and leave a trail of galaxies 
 And dream of me? 
 What kind of love 
 Is writing my story till the end 
 With Mercy's pen? 
 Only You. 
 What kind of King 
 Would choose to wear a crown 
 That bleeds and scars 
 To win my heart? 
 What kind of Love 
 Tells me I'm the reason He can't stay 
 Inside the grave? 
 You 
 Is it You? 
 Standing here before my eyes 
 Every part of my heart cries 
 Alive, alive 
 Look what Mercy's overcome 
 Death has lost 
 And love has won 
 Alive, alive 
 Hallelujah risen Lord 
 The only one I fall before 
 I am His, because He is, alive 
 Who could speak, and send the demons back 
 From where they came, with just one Name? 
 What other heart would let itself be broken every time 
 Till He healed mine? 
 You 
 Only You 
 Could turn my darkness into dawn 
 Running right into Your arms 
 Alive, alive 
 Look what Mercy's overcome 
 Death has lost 
 And love has won 
 Alive, alive 
 Hallelujah risen Lord 
 The only one I fall before 
 I am His, because He is 
 Emmanuel, the promised King 
 The baby who made angels sing 
 Son of Man who walked with us 
 Healing, breathing in our dust 
 The author of all history 
 The answer to all mysteries 
 The Lamb of God who rolled away 
 The stone in front of every grave 
 Alive, alive 
 Look what Mercy's overcome 
 Death has lost 
 And love has won 
 Alive, alive 
 Hallelujah risen Lord 
 The only one I fall before 
 I am His, because He is, alive

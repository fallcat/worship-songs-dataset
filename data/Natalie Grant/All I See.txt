Breathe on me 
 In my brokenness 
 Cover me 
 With Your holiness 
 Whisper words of hope 
 And let me know 
 In all I'm going through 
 You will carry me and not let go 
 ANd You'll hide my heart in You 
 All I see 
 Is something that is beautiful 
 Takes my breath away 
 The treasures of 
 The Father's heart are bountiful 
 In this Heavenly place 
 So much love 
 Flowing free from You 
 Bdoundless grace 
 Overwhelming me 
 Let me do the work You've called me to 
 And to never walk away 
 To live a life that pleases You 
 And glorifies You name 
 And I will look forward to 
 This endless day 
 I will lift my voice 
 In endless praise

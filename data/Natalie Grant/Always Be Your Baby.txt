You were my first love 
 Always there for me 
 You taught me how to walk and how to dream 
 God gave me your eyes 
 But it was you who showed me how to see 
 Now I can stand on my own 
 But I know you'll never let go 
 I'll always be your baby 
 No matter how the years fly by 
 The way you loved me 
 Made me who I am in this world 
 I'm a woman now 
 Not a little girl 
 Wherever this life takes me 
 I'll always be your baby 
 You are my hero 
 And that will never change 
 You still can dry my tears with just your smile 
 The one I've leaned on 
 From my first steps 
 To walking down the aisle 
 Now there's another man in my life 
 But I know by the look in your eyes 
 I'll always be your baby 
 No matter how the years fly by 
 The way you loved me 
 Made me who I am in this world 
 I'm a woman now 
 Not a little girl 
 Wherever this life takes me 
 I'll always be your baby 
 Your faith, your love and all that you believe 
 Have come to be the strongest part of me 
 And I will always be your baby 
 No matter how the years fly by 
 The way you loved me 
 Made me who I am in this world 
 I'm a woman now 
 Not a little girl 
 Wherever this life takes me 
 I'll always be your baby

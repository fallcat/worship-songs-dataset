Been driving through the night 
 I pull up and see the lights 
 This is the place that I call home 
 I watch you as you sleep 
 Think of all you mean to me 
 Touch your face 
 Kiss you softly 
 Before I go to sleep I pray under the stars 
 Search my soul and check my heart 
 And thank God for 
 Another day 
 Another chance to love the ones I love 
 To find my way 
 To laugh, to dance 
 Watch the sun come up 
 Another day I get to live 
 As if 
 Every breath could be the last I take 
 I get another day 
 I've got a hand that I can hold 
 Someone who knows my soul 
 A safe place to lay my head at night 
 So why do I forget 
 How much I've been blessed in life 
 Forget what means the most to me 
 As I'm waking up again I feel my breathing heart 
 So grateful that I've come this far 
 And thank God for 
 To make somebody smile 
 Go the extra mile 
 Take a wrong and make it right 
 And try to touch somebody's life 
 I get another day

I'm feeling undone, 
 Just a little lost in place, 
 A little insecure, 
 With this mountain in my face. 
 I am supposed to fly, 
 But I can't get these feet up off the ground, 
 I need You Lord to turn me around! 
 I may never be a star, 
 But I close my eyes and there You are! 
 You simply say to me that I can do, 
 I can do anything! 
 I may never walk the ocean blue, 
 But I know that I can talk to You! 
 I believe that with my trust in You, 
 I can do anything! 
 Not even past go, 
 And I'm already behind. 
 Now I've got to learn to see, 
 Beyond what's in my mind! 
 Ready or not it's calling. 
 Now it's time to take a stand, 
 I can do anything when I'm holding your hand! 
 I may never be a star, 
 But I close my eyes and there You are! 
 You simply say to me that I can do, 
 I can do anything! 
 I may never walk the ocean blue, 
 But I know that I can talk to You! 
 I believe that with my trust in You, 
 I can do anything! 
 When I start to walk on my own, 
 Everything gets magnified, 
 And I don't feel qualified. 
 When I can't believe what I see, 
 I know that I can find you on my knees! 
 And you remind me 
 I may never be a star, 
 But I close my eyes and there You are! 
 You simply say to me that I can do, 
 I can do anything! 
 I may never walk the ocean blue, 
 But I know that I can talk to You! 
 I believe that with my trust in You, 
 I can do anything!

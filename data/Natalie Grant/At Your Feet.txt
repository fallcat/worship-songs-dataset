She brought You oil, the purest gift she had 
 You washed her soul with her tears 
 Though more than a thousand years have passed 
 I still weep at how much that woman's just like me 
 And how much I want to be 
 At Your feet 
 Where I feel Your Spirit cover me 
 And the darkest of my sins, they are forgiven 
 What would You ask of me, I'd give up everything 
 Just so I can be at Your feet 
 I know one day I will open up my eyes 
 To the wonders of Heaven foretold 
 And I'll see that glorious mansion on high 
 But, I'll be content just to see Your face 
 If I can just find my place

Sometimes I feel like I'm just existing 
 I'm not really living 
 I'm only watching the time slip away 
 I've forgotten who I am in you 
 I'm not who I'm meant to be 
 I'm drifting farther away from my destiny 
 Awaken my heart, awaken my soul 
 Awaken you power and take control 
 Awaken the passion to live for you, Lord 
 Awaken me 
 My soul is longing, my heart is searching 
 I'm desperate for you to move 
 Give me a hunger, pull me closer 
 I'm crying out to you 
 Open my eyes so I can see your presence 
 Dwelling inside 
 Wake me up, 'cause I can't live another minute 
 If I'm not shining your light 
 Awaken my heart, Awaken my soul 
 Awaken the passion inside of me 
 Lord, awaken me to live my destiny 
 Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me 
 Lord, awaken me to live my destiny 
 Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me

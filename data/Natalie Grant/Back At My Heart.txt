Strong on the outside 
 But coming apart at the seams 
 That's me 
 Tragically always together 
 But bruised underneath 
 That's me 
 I stand just to stumble 
 I trip on my pride 
 Why do I always try to hide 
 Meanwhile back at my heart 
 I'm desperate for all that You are 
 See through me and take me apart 
 Meanwhile back at my soul 
 Mend me, please make me whole 
 You know just where to start 
 Back at my heart, back at my heart 
 Patiently waiting to pick up 
 The pieces of me 
 That's You 
 Healer of hearts 
 When the world leaves it broken in two 
 That's You 
 Maker of heaven 
 The sky and the sea 
 When You stretched your arms 
 You reached for me 
 Meanwhile back at my heart 
 I'm desperate for all that You are 
 Undo me and take me apart 
 Meanwhile back at my soul 
 Mend me, please make me whole 
 You know just where to start 
 Back at my heart 
 Back at my fear 
 Back at my brokenness 
 Lord meet me here 
 I am exposed 
 And I'm not afraid anymore 
 Meanwhile back at my heart 
 I'm desperate for all that You are 
 Undo me and take me apart 
 Meanwhile back at my soul 
 Mend me, please make me whole 
 You know just where to start

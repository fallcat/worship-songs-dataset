We don't feel ready 
 We don't feel steady 
 Question what we really have to give 
 Stay where it's safer 
 Claim faith, but waiver 
 Is this how we really meant to live? 
 We pray but never move 
 We say but never do 
 It's time to get our hands dirty 
 Be love there's a whole lot of hurting 
 Calling all hearts 
 Calling all hands 
 Calling all feet to take a stand 
 Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come 
 When we can be one 
 When we can be one 
 When we can be one 
 A little somethin' 
 Might feel like nothin' 
 But in His hands it's all we'll ever need 
 To speak life to the broken 
 Watch the blind eyes open 
 It's who He's calling you and me 
 To be 
 It's time to get our hands dirty 
 Be love there's a whole lot of hurting 
 Calling all hearts 
 Calling all hands 
 Calling all feet to take a stand 
 Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come 
 When we can be one 
 When we can be one 
 We can be the change, be the hope 
 We can be the arms that don't let go 
 We can be a light in the dark 
 We are, we are where it starts 
 It's time 
 Be love there's a whole lot of hurting 
 Calling all hearts 
 Calling all hands 
 Calling all feet to take a stand 
 Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come 
 When we can be one 
 When we can be one 
 When we can be one 
 We can be the change, be the hope 
 Yeah 
 We can be the arms that don't let go 
 Calling all hearts 
 Calling all hands

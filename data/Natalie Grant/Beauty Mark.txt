What do you see when you look at me? 
 Ten dollar words and philosophies 
 How would you choose to define me 
 Cares for others or just cares what others think? 
 But there is more to me than just what meets the eye 
 It's time to be the change inside 
 I wanna' look like love 
 I wanna' look like, live like faith 
 I wanna' live this life in me showing my face 
 I wanna' look like hope 
 I wanna' look like, live like grace 
 And I know just where to start 
 I'll let you be my beauty mark 
 Looking the part just to play the game 
 Cutting cut up face back looks the same 
 They're just pass stars making a name 
 So shut your part it is a crying shame 
 But I'll put the finger on nobody else but me 
 (Nobody else but me) 
 It's time to be the dreams we need 
 I wanna' look like love 
 I wanna' look like, live like faith 
 I wanna' live this life in me showing my face 
 I wanna' look like hope 
 I wanna' look like, live like grace 
 And I know just where to start 
 I'll let you be my beauty mark 
 Not stopping 
 Love and joy, 
 Peace and kindness 
 Gentleness and self control 
 Nothing, nothing is more beautiful 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahey 
 I wanna' look like love 
 I wanna' look like, live like faith 
 I wanna' live this life in me showing my face 
 I wanna' look like hope 
 I wanna' look like, live like grace 
 And I know just where to start 
 I'll let you feel my beauty mark 
 I'm gona' let you be my beauty mark 
 Yeah, yeah, oh, oh 
 I wanna' look like hope (look like hope) 
 I wanna' look like, live like grace 
 And I know just where to start 
 I'll let you be my beauty mark 
 I'll let you be my beauty mark

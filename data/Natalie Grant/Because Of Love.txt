Because of love he left his throne 
 And made this earth his home 
 He did it willingly 
 For you and me 
 With heaven left behind 
 He came to save all mankind 
 From sin and shame 
 He could have walked away 
 But instead he chose 
 To stay upon that tree 
 And take a crown of thorns for me 
 Because of love 
 Because of love he bore my pain (bore my pain) 
 Shouldering the blame 
 Why did he chose to go (he didn't have to go, no) 
 How could he love me so? 
 Because of love he called to me 
 He said child I will set you free 
 You'll have life abundantly 
 Because of love (because of love) 
 He gave unselfishly 
 Caused my blinded to eyes to see 
 It was you and me he had in mind 
 On the road to Calvary 
 I never known such a perfect love 
 I had fallen down but he picked me up 
 He rescued my soul 
 Now I want the world to know 
 Because of love he left the grave 
 Prepared for us a place 
 He'll back again someday 
 And I will hear him say 
 Because you believed 
 You'll live eternally 
 And I'll fall on my knees 
 And I will cry 
 You are holy, holy, lord god almighty 
 You are worthy, to receive glory 
 Honor and power forever 
 Holy, holy, lord god Almighty 
 You are worthy 
 To receive glory 
 Honor and power forever 
 Amen, A-amen, oh A-amen 
 Amen 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Jesus you are 
 The angels bow down and say 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 All creation cries out 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 You're worthy of all the glory 
 Forever 
 Amen

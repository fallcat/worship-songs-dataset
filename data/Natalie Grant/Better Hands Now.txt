It's hard to stand on shifting sand 
 It's hard to shine in the shadows of the night 
 You can't be free if you don't reach for help 
 You can't love if you don't love yourself 
 There is hope when my faith runs out 
 'Cause I'm in better hands now 
 It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down 
 It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground 
 So take this heart of mine there's no doubt 
 I'm in better hands now 
 I am strong all because of you 
 I stand in awe of every mountain that you move 
 Oh I am changed, yesterday is gone 
 I am safe from this moment on 
 There's no fear when the night comes 'round 
 I'm in better hands now 
 It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down 
 It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground 
 So take this heart of mine there's no doubt 
 I'm in better hands now 
 It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down 
 It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground 
 It's like the world is silent though I know it isn't true 
 It's like the breath of Jesus is right here in this room 
 So take this heart of mine there's no doubt 
 I'm in better hands now 
 I'm in better hands now

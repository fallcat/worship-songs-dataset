We have all been afraid 
 We have all run away 
 From the light, wanting more 
 We forget the love that we're created for 
 Before we even know, we're so far from home 
 Father heal us now 
 God show us how 
 To get back to the life that we've been missing 
 Jesus light the way 
 Teach us today 
 To be who we were born to be 
 We were born then made new 
 We were born to be the images of You 
 Like the sun and the stars 
 So beautifully reflecting who You are 
 Help us dare to be the beauty that You see 
 Father heal us now 
 God show us how 
 To get back to the life that we've been missing 
 Jesus light the way 
 Teach us today 
 To be who we were born to be 
 Born to be 
 There's a fire deep inside us all 
 Shaken by the wind, drowning in the rain 
 And only you can keep it burning bright 
 Only you, only you can light the way 
 God show us how 
 Father heal us now, now 
 Jesus light the way 
 Teach us today 
 To be who we were born to be 
 Father heal us now 
 God show us how 
 To get back to the life that we've been missing 
 Teach us today 
 To be who we were born to be 
 Jesus light the way

In humble adoration 
 I kneel before Your throne 
 In brokenness I seek 
 Your face alone 
 Above You there's no other 
 Who's able to restore my soul 
 Come and make me whole 
 Breathe on me 
 Power of God come in and change me 
 You are all I need 
 Holy Spirit breathe on me 
 I'm ready to surrender 
 To give You all my life 
 No matter what the cost or sacrifice 
 Reveal to me Your calling 
 Cleanse me from my prideful ways 
 Use me now I pray 
 Breathe on me 
 Power of God come in and change me 
 You are all I need 
 Holy Spirit breathe on me 
 I will say of the Lord 
 He is my strong tower 
 My rock and my fortress in whom I trust 
 In times of the storm and in tribulation 
 He is my help and my salvation 
 Oh breath of God 
 Restore my soul 
 I will say of the Lord 
 He is my strong tower 
 My rock and my fortress in whom I trust 
 In times of the storm and in tribulation 
 He is my help and my salvation 
 Breathe on me 
 Power of God come in and change me 
 You are all I need 
 Holy Spirit breathe on me 
 I need Thee how I need Thee 
 Every hour I need Thee 
 O Bless me now my Savior 
 I come to Thee

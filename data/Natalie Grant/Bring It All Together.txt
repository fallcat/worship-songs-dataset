I hear you say 
 That you can't go on 
 Cause you had it all and watched it fall away 
 You feel betrayed 
 Cause everything's gone wrong 
 Can't find the strength to hope for a better day 
 You may not understand the reasons 
 But His promise will never change 
 He's gonna take your pain 
 He's gonna take your doubt 
 He's gonna bring it all together, bring it all together 
 Gonna make you happy 
 He's gonna make you laugh out loud 
 He's gonna bring it all together 
 Bring it all together for good 
 You say you live your life 
 Doing the best you can 
 Wondering if the struggle means anything 
 If you realized that it's in His hands 
 You'll find the peace that surrender brings 
 We may not understand the reasons 
 But His promise will never change 
 He's gonna take your pain 
 He's gonnna take your doubt 
 He's gonna bring it all together, 
 Bring it all together 
 Gonna make you happy 
 He's gonna make you laugh out loud 
 He's gonna bring it all together 
 Bring it all together for good 
 There will come a day of healing 
 We will see the master plan 
 We will celebrate His faithfulness 
 And we'll sing (sing) and we'll shout (shout) 
 Praise His name

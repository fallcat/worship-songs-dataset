Lately I don't recognize you 
 The fire in your eyes it fading into embers 
 So while you're out there in the darkness 
 I'm pray you'll remember 
 You were made to shine 
 You were made for life 
 Even if you've lost your way 
 Turn and you will hear love say 
 You were made for more, so much more 
 Child of everlasting light 
 Made to blaze away the night 
 So baby burn bright 
 Burn bright 
 You can rise up from the ashes 
 Make something beautiful of all the broken pieces 
 And I'm believing you'll come running 
 Into the arms of Jesus 
 You were made to shine 
 You were made for life 
 Even if you've lost your way 
 Turn and you will hear love say 
 You were made for more, so much more 
 Child of everlasting light 
 Made to blaze away the night 
 So baby burn bright 
 Burn bright 
 There will always be somebody in the dark 
 Ready to rain down on your last spark 
 Trying to blow out your flame again 
 They will do it if you let them 
 Oh, so don't you let them 
 You were made to shine 
 You were made for life 
 Even if you've lost your way 
 Turn and you will hear love say 
 You were made for more, so much more 
 Child of everlasting light 
 Made to blaze away the night 
 So baby burn bright 
 Burn bright 
 Oh, burn bright 
 Oh, burn bright 
 I'm believing you'll come running 
 Into the arms of Jesus

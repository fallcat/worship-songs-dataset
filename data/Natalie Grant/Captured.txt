It must mean something 
 When I close my eyes 
 Visions of You come to me and flood my mind 
 It must mean something 
 When my heart is true 
 All that I can think about is You 
 Everywhere I go You find me 
 Even when I run 
 I'm captured 
 I'm captured in You 
 Everywhere Your love surrounds me 
 I cannot escape 
 I'm captured 
 I'm captured in You 
 It must mean something 
 When I'm standing still 
 Yours is the only voice I wanna hear 
 It must mean something 
 That I've come this far 
 Lifting up my hands and offering my heart 
 Everywhere I go You find me 
 Even when I run 
 I'm captured 
 I'm captured in You 
 Everywhere Your love surrounds me 
 I cannot escape 
 I'm captured 
 I'm captured 
 You are the sky 
 You are the sea 
 You are the air I wanna breathe 
 You're everywhere 
 Your love lasts forever 
 And if I fall 
 You won't let go 
 You hold me when I can't hold on anymore 
 You reach out and rescue me 
 Everywhere I go You find me 
 Even when I run 
 I'm captured 
 I'm captured in You 
 Everywhere Your love surrounds me 
 I cannot escape 
 I'm captured 
 I'm captured

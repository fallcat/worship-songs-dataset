I see shattered 
 You see whole 
 I see broken 
 But You see beautiful 
 And You're helping me to believe 
 You're restoring me piece by piece 
 There's nothing too dirty that You can't make worthy 
 You wash me in mercy 
 I am clean 
 There's nothing too dirty that You can't make worthy 
 You wash me in mercy 
 I am clean 
 What was dead now lives again 
 My heart's beating, beating inside my chest 
 Oh I'm coming alive with joy and destiny 
 Cause You're restoring me piece by piece 
 There's nothing too dirty that You can't make worthy 
 You wash me in mercy 
 I am clean 
 There's nothing too dirty that You can't make worthy 
 You wash me in mercy 
 I am clean 
 Washed in the blood of Your sacrifice 
 Your blood flowed red and made me white 
 My dirty rags are purified 
 I am clean

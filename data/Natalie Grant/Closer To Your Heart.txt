Here I am once again, 
 Crying out on the floor. 
 Trying to make sense 
 Of this emptiness, once more. 
 I can't do this on my own. 
 I'm in too deep, 
 I should have known. 
 I know You made me for 
 So much more than this. 
 I've been running so fast, 
 Trying to get back to the start. 
 I've been holding so tight, 
 But it all just comes apart. 
 Pull me in, break me down, 
 Make me new and bring me 
 Closer to Your heart, heart, heart, heart, heart [x2] 
 Help me be unafraid, 
 Find my place where You are. 
 Oh, You've always been enough, 
 You're the light in the dark. 
 Afraid of giving up control, 
 You are there, but I let go. 
 You're taking this brokenness, 
 Making it beautiful. 
 I've been running so fast, 
 Trying to get back to the start. 
 I've been holding so tight, 
 But it all just comes apart. 
 Pull me in, break me down, 
 Make me new and 
 Bring me closer to Your 
 Heart [x5] 
 Oh oh, make me come clean. 
 Oh oh, You're all I need. 
 Oh oh, bring me closer to 
 Your heart, heart, heart. 
 Closer to Your heart, heart, heart, heart, heart. 
 I've been running so fast, 
 Trying to get back to the start. 
 I've been holding so tight, 
 But it all just comes apart. 
 Pull me in, break me down, 
 Make me new and bring 
 Me closer to Your heart, heart, heart, heart, heart. 
 Closer to You're heart, heart, heart, heart, heart. 
 Closer to You're heart, heart, heart, heart.

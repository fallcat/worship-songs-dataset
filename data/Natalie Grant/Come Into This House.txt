Come into this house, 
 Magnify the Lord, 
 Lift up holy hands, 
 Our hearts in one accord 
 He's worthy, worthy of all our praise 
 He's worthy, worthy of all our praise 
 Sing a melody, 
 Sing unto the Lord, 
 He has given us 
 A song and a sword 
 He's worthy, worthy of all our praise 
 He's worthy, worthy of all our praise 
 Worthy of honor and glory 
 Worthy of power and praise 
 Worship and bow down before him 
 Exalt his name today 
 He's worthy, 
 Worthy, worthy,

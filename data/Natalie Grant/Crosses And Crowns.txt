For those who seek the face of God 
 For those who call the name of Christ 
 The road upon this earthly sod 
 Will one day lead to Paradise 
 We embrace the cross of Calvary 
 Pressing toward the prize we will receive 
 We're waiting on new wings 
 Searching an old sky 
 Waiting for the day, we see Heaven coming down 
 There's a Promiseland awaiting 
 But, there's mercy in the meantime 
 While we're walking on this ground 
 Between crosses and crowns 
 We stumble and we lose our way 
 We question what we're doing here 
 Yet all the time we watch and pray 
 We're wondering if the end is near 
 So He left us His amazing grace 
 Until we see Him face to face 
 We're pilgrims on a mission field 
 Where the heart gets changed 
 And the soul gets healed 
 There's a purpose in these shadowlands 
 Between the crowns of gold 
 And the nail-scarred hands

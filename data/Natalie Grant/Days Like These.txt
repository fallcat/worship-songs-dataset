Days Like These 
 ~Natalie Grant 
 (Days Like These) 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Mmm hmmm 
 Rolled out of bed on the right side 
 Lookin' up at a big blue sky 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Who I am is what I am 
 A piece in the part of a bigger plan 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Breathe deep, taste the moment 
 Few and far between 
 Days like these, they don't get any better 
 Let this be for always and forever 
 Every minute is so perfectly 
 Just the way that it was meant to be 
 Days like these, so graceful that I'm fallin' 
 On my knees and thankin' God for all the 
 Little things that make me wanna say 
 How I wish I had a million days like these 
 I've been runnin' like a dream 
 I know I can do anything 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Days like this I could believe 
 The sun is shinin' just for me 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Eyes closed, touch the freedom 
 And never let it go, no, no 
 Days like these, they don't get any better 
 Let this be for always and forever 
 Every minute is so perfectly 
 Just the way that it was meant to be 
 Days like these, so graceful that I'm fallin' 
 On my knees and thankin' God for all the 
 Little things that make me wanna say 
 How I wish I had a million days like these 
 Ye---ah 
 It's as if I never ever knew that clouds existed 
 If there ever was a day to take a chance or risk it 
 Oh take it, embrace it and never let it go. 
 Don't let it go. 
 (Days like these) 
 They don't get any better 
 (Days like these) 
 I want more 
 (Days like these) 
 Blue skies The sun is shinin' just for me, just for me 
 Ye-ah--- 
 (Days like these) 
 They don't get any better 
 Let this be for always and forever 
 Every minute is so perfectly 
 Just the way that it was meant to be 
 Days like these, so graceful that I'm fallin' 
 On my knees and thankin' God for all the little things 
 Oh, how I wish I had a million more 
 (Days like these) 
 Days like these 
 (I could believe) 
 I believe 
 (The sun is shinin') 
 Is shinin' 
 (Just for me) 
 Just for me 
 (Big blue skies) 
 Big blue skies 
 (Don't ever leave) 
 Please don't go 
 (I'm livin' for) 
 I'm livin' for days like these

My hands reach for You 
 I feel You moving 
 You're making new 
 These ruins 
 And hope inside is rising 
 All the time I'm finding 
 You are the love with a deepest affection 
 You stole my heart, You're my only obsession 
 Oh, You've electrified my soul 
 And You're making the dead alive 
 I'm alive 
 My voice sings Your praise 
 The King of glory 
 I wanna be a page 
 In Your story 
 Cause there is nothing greater 
 Than Your touch, my Savior 
 You are the love with a deepest affection 
 You stole my heart, You're my only obsession 
 Oh, You've electrified my soul 
 And You're making the dead alive 
 I'm alive 
 With precious blood 
 My debt was paid 
 Crimson love that forgave 
 Conquered the grave 
 And making the dead alive 
 Yeah, You are the love with a deepest affection 
 You stole my heart, You're my only obsession 
 Oh, You've electrified my soul 
 And You're making the dead alive 
 I'm alive 
 I'm alive 
 And You're making the dead alive

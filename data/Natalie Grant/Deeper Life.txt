So many voices calling out to me 
 To sell me something, tell me what I need 
 But they don't know about the treasure I've found 
 A gift from heaven I can't live without 
 It's a kingdom and it's hidden deep inside 
 I will be living for much more than meets the eye 
 'Cause I need the deeper life 
 Where the love of God runs far and wide 
 I need the deeper life 
 I will give him all my heart and mind 
 I won't be swept away by every changing tide 
 I believe in the deeper life 
 I've got my telephone, got my radio 
 I got a lotta places I can go 
 But where I wanna be is off the deep end 
 My Jesus meets me when I dive right in 
 Don't wanna slip slide on the surface of this life 
 My soul will search until this thirst is satisfied 
 'Cause I need the deeper life 
 Where the love of God runs far and wide 
 I need the deeper life 
 I will give him all my heart and mind 
 I won't be swept away by every changing tide 
 I believe in the deeper life 
 I will be seeking first the kingdom of My God 
 I want everything he's got

This is my prayer in the desert 
 When all that's within me feels dry 
 This is my prayer in the hunger in me 
 My God is a God who provides. 
 And this is my prayer in the fire 
 In weakness or trial or pain 
 There is a faith proved or more worth that gold 
 So refine me, Lord through the flames 
 I will bring praise 
 I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 I will rejoice 
 I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 And this is my prayer in the battle 
 When triumph is still on it's way 
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ 
 So firm on His promise I'll stand 
 I will bring praise 
 I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 I will rejoice 
 I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 All of my life 
 In every season 
 You are still God 
 I have a reason to sing 
 I have a reason to worship 
 All of my life 
 In every season 
 You are still God 
 I have a reason to sing 
 I have a reason to worship 
 All of my life 
 In every season 
 You are still God 
 I have a reason to sing 
 I have a reason to worship 
 I will bring praise 
 I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 I will rejoice 
 I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 I will bring praise 
 I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 I will rejoice 
 I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 This is my prayer in the harvest 
 When favor and providence flow 
 I know I'm filled to be emptied again 
 The seed I've received I will sow

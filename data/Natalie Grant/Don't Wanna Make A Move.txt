"Lord, Please guide my steps. 
 I commit my way to You. 
 I won't make a move, 
 Until I hear Your voice!" 
 I don't wanna make a move! 
 I gotta be on guard 'cause, 
 Who knows what's in the shadows, 
 To try and keep me off of this road, 
 And lead me astray. 
 I want every step to be in the right place 
 At the right time! 
 So I'm searching for You Lord, 
 To guide me every day! 
 I don't wanna make a move without the faith! 
 Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth. 
 In the twist and turns along the way, 
 I don't, I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You! 
 I don't wanna make a move, don't wanna make a move! 
 You got me when I woke up today, 
 I was turning through the pages. 
 Looking for some Wisdom that might show me 
 Where You lead. 
 Nothing short of You will satisfy my hunger! 
 You can hear me crying out every night, 
 From down on my knees! 
 I don't wanna make a move without the faith! 
 Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth. 
 In the twist and turns along the way, 
 I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You! 
 In the still and quiet, 
 I bow my heart, 
 Incline my ear. 
 Anything You whisper 
 Lord, I want to hear! 
 Lord, I need to hear You! 
 I don't wanna make a move without the faith! 
 Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth. 
 In the twist and turns along the way, 
 I don't, don't, don't, will not make a move without You! 
 I don't wanna make a move without the faith! 
 Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth. 
 In the twist and turns along the way, 
 I don't, don't, don't, won't make a move without You! 
 I will follow You, 
 Gonna do what You tell me to! 
 I need You, 
 I will follow you Jesus! 
 And I will follow You 
 I don't wanna make a move 
 I will follow You, yes 
 I don't wanna make a move 
 Gonna follow You

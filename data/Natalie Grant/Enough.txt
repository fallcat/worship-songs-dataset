Here where the silence speaks 
 Here in the great unseen 
 Here when the answer's out of reach 
 Here I will brace my heart 
 Here I will brave the dark 
 Here find You singing over me 
 I am known, I am seen 
 I am carried by the One who won't forsake me 
 I am held, I'm not alone 
 And I know that You will never let me go 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 It's all I have, it's all I need and it's enough 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 It's all I have, it's all I need and it's enough 
 It's all I have, it's all I need it's enough 
 Here I'll let faith collide 
 With fear, knowing I will find 
 You are only good, and only kind 
 I am known, I am seen 
 I am carried by the One who won't forsake me 
 I am held, I'm not alone 
 'Cause I know that You will never let me go 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 It's all I have, it's all I need and it's enough 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 It's all I have, it's all I need and it's enough 
 It's all I have, it's all I need it's enough 
 In my weakness you are closest 
 When I'm heavy and heartbroken 
 Still You whisper every moment 
 You are mine when the storm is finally over 
 And the Heavens are wide open 
 Still You whisper every moment You are mine 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 It's all I have, it's all I need and it's enough 
 Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love 
 It's all I have, it's all I need and it's enough 
 It's all I have, it's all I need it's enough 
 You're all I have 
 You're all I need 
 You are enough

Fairest Lord Jesus, ruler of all nature 
 Oh, Thou of God and man the Son 
 Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor 
 Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown 
 Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight 
 And all the twinkling starry host 
 Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer 
 Than all the Angels, Heaven can boast 
 Fairest, fairest Lord Jesus 
 Fairest, fairest Lord Jesus 
 Beautiful Savior, Lord of all the nations 
 Oh, Son of God and Son of man 
 Glory and honor, praise, adoration 
 Both now and forever more be Thine 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 Now and forever more

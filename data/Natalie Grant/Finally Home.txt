I am here alone, in the falling snow, 
 And the wind, it cools my tears. 
 I have been so wrong, 
 I have turned away, but the road was long, 
 And finally I have come to my knees, 
 I want to be' 
 Where I can walk, 
 Where I can run, 
 Where my heart sings, 
 And I feel the sun, 
 Where I can trust, 
 And I'm strong enough, 
 Free like the wind, 
 I'll run into my Father's arms, 
 I'm finally home! 
 Oh the winds of change, 
 They blow slow and cool! 
 Oh the wandering of a fool, 
 But I have laid it down, 
 In my Father's hands, 
 Where the weight of suffering, 
 Is carried by the arms of a cross, 
 Healing my loss' 
 Where I can walk, 
 Where I can run, 
 Where my heart sings, 
 And I feel the sun, 
 Where I can trust, 
 And I'm strong enough, 
 Free like the wind, 
 I'll run into my Father's arms 
 Heaven has reached into my lonely soul. 
 Loving so deep, and so complete, 
 'Til I don't feel alone. 
 Where the light of love is burning, 
 Where the past is washed away, 
 Where I feel the sunlight shining on my face! 
 Now I can 
 Walk! 
 Now I can run, 
 Now my heart sings, 
 And I feel the sun, 
 Now I can trust, 
 And I'm strong enough, 
 Free like the wind, 
 I'll run into my Father's arms, 
 I'm finally home! 
 Now I can trust, 
 And I'm strong enough, 
 Free like the wind I run, 
 Into my Father's arms 
 I'm finally home

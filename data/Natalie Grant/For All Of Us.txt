Oh grace without exception 
 How fortunate are we 
 That this love without measure 
 Is able to redeem 
 And without hesitation 
 Our sin is washed away 
 Unforgettable the moment 
 How glorious the day 
 Here at the cross 
 Your death, the price 
 Your agony means life 
 For all of us 
 You did it for all of us 
 Here at the cross 
 It's finally done 
 Your victory is won 
 For all of us 
 You did it for all of us 
 The mystery of the ages 
 Unfolded on a hill 
 With the ringing of a hammer 
 Hope is now revealed 
 The very king of heaven 
 Comes a spotless Lamb 
 Holding all our guilt and shame 
 In His outstretched hands 
 Here at the cross 
 Your death, the price 
 Your agony means life 
 For all of us 
 You did it for all of us 
 Here at the cross 
 It's finally done 
 Your victory is won 
 For all of us 
 You did it for all of us 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Worthy is the Lamb 
 That was slain [x2] 
 Here at the cross 
 Your death, the price 
 Your agony means life 
 For all of us 
 You did it for all of us 
 Here at the cross 
 It's finally done 
 Your victory is won 
 For all of us 
 You did it for all of us

Happiness is temporary 
 It's here and gone in a flash of light 
 Troubles come without a warning 
 To turn the day into the night 
 Oh, when everything is changing 
 Oh, the truth is still the same 
 Oh, and I know that no one can 
 Ever steal it away 
 I'm gonna dance to the beat of amazing grace 
 Gonna hold to the promise that You made 
 And I know whatever's gonna come my way 
 You're here with me and it's going to be a good day 
 It's going to be a good day, a good day 
 Fear can be so, so convincing 
 But I will keep my eyes on You 
 In every moment help me remember 
 That You always will bring me through 
 Oh, 'cause You're forever faithful 
 Oh, the Truth is still the same 
 Oh, and I know that no one can 
 Ever steal it away 
 I'm gonna dance to the beat of amazing grace 
 Gonna hold to the promise that You made 
 And I know whatever's gonna come my way 
 You're here with me and it's going to be a good day 
 It's going to be a good day, a good day 
 Come my way 
 You're here with me and it's going to be a good day 
 And You carry me, carry me 
 And You carry me, carry me 
 And You carry me, carry me 
 Because You're for me 
 You'll be with me till the end 
 Because You're for me 
 You'll be with me till the end 
 Because You're for me 
 You'll be with me till the end 
 Because You're for me 
 You'll be with me till the end 
 I'm gonna dance to the beat of amazing grace 
 Gonna hold to the promise that You made 
 And I know whatever's gonna come my way 
 You're here with me and it's going to be a good day 
 It's going to be a good day, a good day 
 Come my way 
 You're here with me and it's going to be a good day

Give me eyes to see the more of who you are 
 May what I behold still my anxious heart 
 Take what I have known and break it all apart 
 For you my God... are greater still 
 And no sky contains, no doubt restrains 
 All you are, the greatness of our God! 
 I'll spend my life to know 
 And I'm far from close to all 
 You are the greatness of our God 
 Give me grace to see beyond this moment here 
 To believe that there is nothing left to fear 
 That you alone are high above it all 
 And you, my God, are greater still... 
 And no sky contains, no doubt restrains 
 All you are the greatness of our God! 
 I'll spend my life to know 
 And I'm far from close to all 
 You are the greatness of our God 
 And there is nothing that could ever separate us 
 No, there is nothing that could ever separate us from your love 
 No life, no death 
 Of this I am convinced 
 You, my God, are greater still... 
 And no words could say or song convey 
 All you are, the greatness of our God 
 I'll spend my life to know 
 And I'm far from close to all 
 You are the greatness of our God 
 And no sky contains, no doubt restrains 
 All you are, the greatness of our God! 
 I'll spend my life to know 
 And I'm far from close to all 
 You are the greatness of our God

I think about all the time I wasted, 
 Trying to figure out 
 What in the world my heart could ever trust 
 What I finally found... 
 There ain't nothing on this earth 
 Was ever gonna satisfy (me) 
 I think about all the life I've tasted now 
 What I'd done without 
 And sometimes I still wonder how 
 You turned my heart around 
 How You brought light into the world 
 Love into my longing life 
 Well, down here, 
 I find my hope when I'm looking for You 
 Well, things are looking up now... 
 Set my mind on things above 
 I prefer the wonder of 
 Your amazing grace, Your higher way 
 Your mystery 
 Won't rely on earthly things, 
 Only want the love You bring 
 'Cause I hope in the Heavenly 
 I think about all the time I wasted here 
 All that I dreamed about 
 And in pursuit of happiness I fear 
 I let some people down 
 So Lord, I pray that they see through me 
 See You on the other side 
 Well, down here, 
 I find my hope when I'm trusting in You 
 Well, things are looking up now... 
 Down here, I find my life in You 
 My heart is complete 
 For You're all the hope I need in the world 
 And You're the love I lean into 
 Yeah things are looking up now'

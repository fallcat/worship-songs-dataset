Two months is too little 
 They let him go 
 They had no sudden healing 
 To think that providence would 
 Take a child from his mother while she prays 
 Is appalling 
 Who told us we'd be rescued? 
 What has changed and why should we be saved from nightmares? 
 We're asking why this happens 
 To us who have died to live? 
 It's unfair 
 This is what it means to be held 
 How it feels when the sacred is torn from your life 
 And you survive 
 This is what it is to be loved 
 And to know that the promise was 
 When everything fell we'd be held 
 This hand is bitterness 
 We want to taste it, let the hatred NUMB our sorrow 
 The wise hands opens slowly to lilies of the valley and tomorrow 
 This is what it means to be held 
 How it feels when the sacred is torn from your life 
 And you survive 
 This is what it is to be loved 
 And to know that the promise was 
 When everything fell we'd be held 
 If hope is born of suffering 
 If this is only the beginning 
 Can we not wait for one hour watching for our Savior? 
 This is what it means to be held 
 How it feels when the sacred is torn from your life 
 And you survive 
 This is what it is to be loved 
 And to know that the promise was 
 When everything fell we'd be held

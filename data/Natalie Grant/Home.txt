You keep watching the rain come down 
 Pretty princess broken crown 
 And your dreams have all burned out 
 But don't you know that they brought you here somehow 
 All you need to know is 
 You're home, where secrets are told 
 See a new world unfolding 
 Where hearts are one, the pain's undone 
 And you're finally belonging here 
 And you need to know, you need to know 
 You're home 
 You need to know, you need to know 
 You're home 
 So take your coat off and stay awhile 
 What made you cry can make you smile again 
 You can hold your head up high 
 Don't you know that you, oh girl, you were born to fly? 
 When you realize 
 You're home, secrets are told 
 See a new world unfolding 
 Where hearts are one, the pain's undone 
 And you're finally belonging here 
 And you need to know, you need to know 
 You're home 
 You need to know, oh, you really need to know 
 You're home 
 Welcome home 
 Every thing's gonna be alright 
 'Cause you're home 
 Feel the sun, your day has come 
 You're not alone 
 You're home 
 Feel the sun, your day has come 
 You're not alone 
 You're home 
 Feel the sun, your day has come 
 You're not alone 
 You're home 
 You belong in, you belong in 
 You belong in your home 
 Every thing's gonna be alright 
 'Cause you're home 
 You're home

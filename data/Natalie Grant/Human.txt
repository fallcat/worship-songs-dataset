Every life has a choice 
 To rise up to fill the void 
 Every heart has a mission 
 And we are called to be human 
 We gotta do better than this 'cause we only got 
 One chance to make a difference 
 We gotta do better than this 'cause we only got 
 One life that we've been given 
 A little love, a little kindness 
 A little light in this time of darkness 
 It'll be what makes us different 
 It'll be what makes us human 
 I'm human, you're human, we are human 
 We are marked with His image 
 And we are scarred with indifference 
 Maybe now we should listen 
 Hear the cry of God's children 
 We gotta do better than this 'cause we only got 
 One chance to make a difference 
 We gotta do better than this 'cause we only got 
 One life that we've been given 
 A little love, a little kindness 
 A little light in this time of darkness 
 It'll be what makes the difference 
 It'll be what makes us human 
 I'm human, you're human, we are 
 We are human 
 I'm human, you're human, we are 
 We are human 
 Gotta do better than this 'cause I only got 
 One chance to make a difference 
 Gotta do better than this 'cause I'm only 
 Just one 
 I'm human, you're human, we are 
 We are human 
 I'm human, you're human, we are 
 We are human 
 It'll be what makes the difference 
 It'll be what makes us human

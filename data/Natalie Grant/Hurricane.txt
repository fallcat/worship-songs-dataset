You're spinning 
 Out of control 
 Again 
 Your life feels like a sinking ship 
 You're wondering 
 How it came to 
 This 
 Is it too late? 
 Is it too far? 
 For him to reach you 
 And come to where you 
 Are 
 Step out the edge 
 Don't be afraid of it 
 And when you feel the rain 
 Call his name 
 He'll find you in the hurricane 
 You're in the wreckage underneath 
 You're hope is buried 
 Somewhere deep 
 You're wondering 
 How long it will keep? 
 It's never too late 
 Never too far 
 For you to reach out 
 And take a hold of love 
 Step out on the edge 
 Don't be afraid of it 
 And when you feel the rain 
 Call his name 
 He'll find you in a hurricane 
 Don't back down from the light 
 He'll shelter you tonight 
 Just hold on for the change 
 Call his name 
 He'll find you in the hurricane 
 There's a place 
 You can run 
 When you fall 
 And it's all come undone 
 You'll be safe in the raging storm 
 So just let go 
 Cause you are held in his arms 
 Step out on the edge 
 Don't be afraid of it 
 And when you feel the rain 
 Call his name 
 He'll find you in a hurricane 
 And when you feel the rain 
 Call his name 
 He'll find you in a hurricane

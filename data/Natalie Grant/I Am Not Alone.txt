You are here in my heart, 
 You're the light that guides me through the dark. 
 You walk beside me, 
 The night seems cold each time I fall, 
 Your arms are there to hold. 
 You walk beside me, giving strength I've never known. 
 And I am not alone 
 You walk beside me. 
 (I am not alone) 
 You are here in my mind, 
 I talk to you and all my fears unwind. 
 I know I'm loved, for who I am, 
 You make me want to be the best that I can. 
 And you walk beside me, giving strength I've never known. 
 I am not alone, 
 You walk beside me. 
 I am not alone 
 Whereever the road leads. 
 And I rely on your patience, 
 When I face the unknown. 
 And because of you, I am... 
 I am not alone... 
 I am not alone... ooh 
 You're always beside me, yeah, I am not alone. 
 In the sun, In the rain 
 Through the good times and 
 In the pain. 
 You're always beside me, 
 I reach out for your hand, 
 I know that you understand.

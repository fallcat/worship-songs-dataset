In a land far away 
 Time stood still 
 Long ago 
 There were shepherds in fields 
 Or at least this is how 
 The story goes 
 The story goes 
 Woman withchild 
 And an inn with no room 
 Born in a manger 
 For telling it tomb 
 This is how 
 The story goes 
 But it is more than a fable 
 And it's more than a fairytale 
 And more than my mind can conceive 
 I believe 
 The Wiseman saw 
 The baby boy the angels 
 Called the son of God 
 Heaven's child 
 The great I am 
 Born to take away my sins 
 Through nailed pierced hands 
 Emmanuel has come 
 I believe 
 Two thousand years 
 Still the story lives on 
 God's gift to us 
 Sent to earth Wrapped in flesh 
 His only son 
 His only son 
 And the heartbeat of heaven 
 Confounded our wisdom 
 But it's still the simple truth 
 That sets me free 
 I believe 
 The Wiseman saw 
 The baby boy 
 The angels called the son of God Heaven's child 
 The great I am 
 Born to take away my sins 
 Through nailed pierced hands 
 Emmanuel has come 
 And I believe 
 Precious child How can it be that 
 God's great plan 
 For history 
 Would send you to 
 The lonely tree 
 That you would come 
 For one like me 
 I believe In a cross 
 I believe he came For one, 
 He came for all 
 Heavens child became a man 
 Gave his life for me 
 In spite of all I am 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 Oh I believe 
 Christmas lives in me 
 I believe

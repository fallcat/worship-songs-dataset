Here in this world that you've designed 
 From the rolling plains to the oceans 
 Deep and wide 
 Where are the words that can say what's 
 In my heart 
 All that I am is amazed by who you are 
 The one thing I desire 
 Is just to know you more 
 To live a life that moves and breathes 
 And loves to bring you joy 
 So fill me with the fire 
 That burns away my doubts and all my fears 
 Into a place where you are all I hear 
 It's the one thing I desire 
 To do what you require 
 Is the one thing I desire 
 To love when I'd rather turn away 
 To give when I'm more resigned to take 
 To reach out a hand to someone who 
 Feels alone 
 The way you reach for me 
 When there seemed to be no hope

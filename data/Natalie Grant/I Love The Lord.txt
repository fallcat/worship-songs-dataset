I love the Lord, He heard my cry 
 And He pitied every groan, long as I, I live 
 And troubles rise, I'll hasten to... 
 I'm gonna run to His throne 
 Oh, I love the Lord 
 I really do, I really do love the Lord 
 He heard my cry, yes He did 
 And He pitied every groan, yeah 
 Long as I live and troubles rise 
 I will hasten to... 
 I'm gonna run to His throne 
 I'll hasten to... 
 I'm gonna run to His throne 
 When troubles come my way 
 I'm gonna get myself to Jesus 
 When life gets me down 
 I gotta get myself to Jesus 
 He is the answer, He's the only answer 
 Nobody's gonna keep me from Jesus 
 I'm running to Jesus 
 I'm running, I'm running, I'm running 
 I'll hasten to His throne

Holy One, 
 Father of the Earth, 
 Create in me a pure heart, 
 So I can come in Spirit and in Truth 
 To worship You, 
 That's what I long to do. 
 I love to Praise, 
 I love to lift Your Holy Name! 
 From the rising of the sun, 
 And going down of the same! 
 Your name is great! 
 I will bless You all my days! 
 'Cause I love to Praise! 
 Righteous One, 
 Lover of my soul. 
 Age to age, forever still the same. 
 Your name is like the sweetest melody! 
 Here with You is where I long to be. 
 I love to Praise, 
 I love to lift Your Holy Name! 
 From the rising of the sun, 
 And going down of the same! 
 Your name is great! 
 I will bless You all my days! 
 'Cause I love to Praise! 
 You are Holy, 
 My lips shall always speak Your praise. 
 You are Worthy! 
 Forever I will always sing Your praise! 
 I love to Praise, 
 I love to lift Your Holy Name! 
 From the rising of the sun, 
 And going down of the same! 
 Your name is great! 
 I will bless You all my days! 
 'Cause I love to Praise!

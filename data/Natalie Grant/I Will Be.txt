One heart, one voice 
 Living out love in this world of noise. 
 My dream and my joy 
 Giving You all I have made a choice. 
 Desperately I'm wanting, 
 To answer to Your calling... 
 I will be a candle in the darkness 
 I will be the hand of heaven above (heaven above) 
 I will be a mirror that reflects Your endless love (endless love) 
 I will be the hope among the hopeless, 
 Where there is conflict, I will be peace (I will be peace) 
 Only by the power of Your spirit living in me 
 I will be... yeah (x8) 
 I will be 
 Your heart, Your plan 
 Give me Your eyes help me understand. 
 My feet and my hands 
 Holding out living hope to every man. 
 Knowing what You've made me, 
 With every single heartbeat... 
 I will be a candle in the darkness 
 I will be the hand of heaven above (heaven above) 
 I will be a mirror that reflects your endless love (endless love) 
 I will be the hope among the hopeless 
 Where there is conflict, I will be peace (I will be peace) 
 Only by the power of Your spirit that's living in me

 Knowing that Your love will shine 
 Through me.

I have been the wayward child 
 I have acted out 
 I have questioned Sovereignty 
 And had my share of doubt 
 And though sometimes my prayers feel like 
 They're bouncing off the sky 
 The hand I hold won't let me go 
 And is the reason why... 
 I will stumble 
 I will fall down 
 But I will not be moved 
 I will make mistakes 
 I will face heartache 
 But I will not be moved 
 On Christ the Solid Rock I stand 
 All other ground is sinking sand 
 I will not be moved 
 Bitterness has plagued my heart 
 Many times before 
 My life has been like broken glass 
 And I have kept the score 
 Of all my shattered dreams and though it seemed 
 That I was far too gone 
 My brokenness helped me to see 
 It's grace I'm standing on 
 And the chaos in my life 
 Has been a badge I've worn 
 Though I have been torn 
 I will not be moved

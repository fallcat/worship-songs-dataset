All around us these days, 
 There are souls that cry so deeply, 
 To fill the emptiness we feel inside. 
 We look around so hard to try and find, 
 The kind of love we know that will survive. 
 But here within a heartbeat, 
 Is a love that so completely, 
 Will take away the fear we try to hide, 
 And even though we often wonder why, 
 He gives us love so strong we can't deny. 
 If the world lost all its love, 
 He would still have some to give you! 
 And if the stars should lose their light, 
 We'd still have His to hold back the night! 
 This hope is mine, 
 If the world lost all its love, 
 His still would shine! 
 Hearts in need of kindness, 
 Often stumble into blindness, 
 When the dream world and the real world pull apart. 
 It leaves us with a cold and empty heart. 
 You'd think that we would know right from the start. 
 If the world lost all its love, 
 He would still have some to give you! 
 And if the stars should lose their light, 
 We'd still have His to hold back the night! 
 This hope is mine, 
 If the world lost all its love, 
 His still would shine! 
 Lost inside the hearts we hide, 
 There's hope that He will take us in. 
 To take away the suffering, 
 And let new life begin. 
 If the world lost all its love, 
 He would still have some to give you! 
 And if the stars should lose their light, 
 We'd still have His to hold back the night! 
 This hope is mine, 
 If the world lost all its love, 
 His still would shine!

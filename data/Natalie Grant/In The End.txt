Can't catch a break 
 You've had your fill of old clich√©s 
 Like "life is hard but God is good" 
 And even though it's true 
 It won't stop what you're going through 
 I wish that I could say it would 
 But He's outside of what you feel 
 It might not make sense 
 But one day it will 
 There's coming a day the sun will always shine 
 He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes 
 Hold on my brother, things are gonna better 
 You're gonna smile again 
 'Cause we win in the end 
 Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
 You're standing still 
 Life has handed you a bitter pill 
 Once again you're on your face 
 You've got questions 
 Plenty of secret confessions 
 Wondering if you've run out of grace 
 But He's outside of what you feel 
 This life is just a moment 
 But our forever is sealed, oh yeah 
 There's coming a day the sun will always shine 
 He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes 
 Hold on my brother, things are gonna better 
 You're gonna smile again 
 'Cause we win in the end 
 It won't be about streets of gold, pearly gates 
 Harps and wings, diamond lakes 
 All I know is that He's gonna hold you, hold me 
 Heartache will disappear 
 Questions will become clear 
 Life will all make sense in the end 
 Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
 We win in the end 
 Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
 There's coming a day the sun will always shine 
 He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes 
 Hold on my brother, things are gonna better 
 You're gonna smile again 
 'Cause we win in the end 
 Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
 We win in the end 
 Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
 Glory, glory hallelujah 
 Glory, glory hallelujah 
 Glory, glory hallelujah 
 We win in the end 
 Glory, glory hallelujah 
 Glory, glory hallelujah 
 Glory, glory hallelujah 
 We win in the end 
 We win in the end

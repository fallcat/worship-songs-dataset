Joy to the world, the Lord is come 
 Let earth receive her King, let every heart prepare Him room 
 Let heaven and nature sing, let heaven and nature sing 
 Let heaven, let heaven and nature, heaven and nature sing 
 Joy to the world, the Lord is come 
 Let earth receive her King, let every heart prepare Him room 
 Let heaven and nature sing, let heaven and nature sing 
 Let heaven, let heaven, and nature sing 
 He rules the world with truth and grace 
 And makes the nations prove, the glories of His righteousness 
 And wonders of His love and wonders of His love 
 And wonders, wonders of His love

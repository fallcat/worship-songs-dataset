I don't have to fully know 
 Just how far Your love can go 
 To sing of Your love for me 
 I don't have to comprehend 
 How Your mercy never ends 
 To sing of Your mercy 
 And all I need is 
 All I really need is 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And I'm in awe 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 My God 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And all I can do is worship 
 (All I can do is worship You Lord Yeah) 
 And I don't have to clearly see 
 How amazing grace can be 
 To sing of Your grace for me 
 And I don't have to fully grasp 
 The measure of Your holiness 
 To sing holy holy 
 And all I need is 
 All I really need is 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And I'm in awe 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 My God 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And all I can do is worship 
 I worship You 
 I worship You 
 I worship You 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And I stand in awe 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 You take my breathe away 
 My God 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And all I can do is worship 
 Just a glimpse of You (just a glimpse of You and I'm in awe) 
 And I'm in awe 
 Just a glimpse of You (a glimpse of show me Your glory) 
 My God 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And all I can do is worship 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 And I'm in awe 
 Just a glimpse of You (oh God I stand in wonder)

 Just a glimpse of You 
 And all I can do is worship

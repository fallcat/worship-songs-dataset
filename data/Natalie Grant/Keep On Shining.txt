He will be there 
 Through the hurricane 
 Through the pouring rain 
 He will be there 
 Through the longest night 
 Everything's gonna be all right 
 The storm is gonna end 
 And the sun's gonna rise again 
 Keep on shining 
 Let Love light up the darkest sky 
 And you'll be flying 
 Rise above all the hardest times 
 So hold on (Hold On) 
 Be strong (Be Strong) 
 Come on (Come on, come on) 
 Keep on shining 
 Nothing can stop 
 The way He feels 
 'Cause His Love's so real 
 No mountain top 
 Will ever be too high 
 'Cause with Jesus by your side 
 There's nothing you can't do 
 You're gonna make it through 
 You know in your soul 
 You know in your hearat 
 He will always be your only 
 Guiding star

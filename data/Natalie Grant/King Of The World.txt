I tried to fit you in the walls inside my mind 
 I try to keep you safely in between the lines 
 I try to put you in the box that I've designed 
 I try to pull you down so we are eye to eye 
 When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world? 
 I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world 
 How could I make you so small 
 When you're the one who holds it all 
 When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world 
 Just a whisper of your voice can tame the seas 
 So who am I to try to take the lead 
 Still I run ahead and think I'm strong enough 
 When you're the one who made me from the dust 
 When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world? 
 I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world 
 How could I make you so small 
 When you're the one who holds it all 
 When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world 
 Oh, you set it all in motion 
 Every single moment 
 You brought it all to me 
 And you're holding on to me 
 When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world? 
 I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world 
 How could I make you so small 
 When you're the one who holds it all 
 When did I forget you've always been the king of the world 
 You will always be the king of the world

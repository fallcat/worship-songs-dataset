Changing, 
 Everywhere I am 
 I been stuck in a rut, I been caught up 
 Yeah, it happens fast 
 Moving, 
 To where I wanna begin 
 I wanna find new life and see new eyes 
 And breathe again 
 (I'm gonna) stop now, take a breath 
 It's all so crazy 
 But I'm ready to let go 
 Looking forward to don't know 
 Forget about yesterday, get away 
 And live in the right now 
 Yeah, I'm ready to let go 
 And I'm ready follow 
 Anywhere the road bends 
 Where it ends I don't know 
 So let go 
 Oh, we live in the future 
 We got our regrets 
 'Cause we don't live in 
 The present tense 
 (It's) hectic in my mind 
 (Gonna) leave it behind 
 Don't wanna over think it 
 Don't worry so much 
 Gonna live this life 
 And not lose touch 
 I'm gonna let go

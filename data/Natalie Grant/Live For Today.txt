Sittin' in my room staring at the wall 
 Wonderin' about the meaning of it all 
 Why is it this thing called life 
 Has got me goin' crazy 
 So I open up your word and let it speak to me 
 The purpose and the plan that you've designed 
 Is clear to see, and I believe 
 I'm gonna live for today 
 I'm gonna follow in your way 
 I'm gonna let my little light shine 
 Like there's no tomorrow 
 I won't worry about the past 
 I know my future is intact 
 So I'll choose to live my life one way 
 I'm gonna live it for today 
 You told me not to worry 
 About what lies ahead 
 So I am gonna focus on today instead 
 Making every moment count and counting 
 Every single blessing 
 I'm gonna set my mind on the 
 Here and the Now 
 This is what I want my life to be about 
 And this is How...

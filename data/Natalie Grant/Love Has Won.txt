Out on the front line tonight 
 Fearing defeat, bruised from the fight 
 Feeling too tired to run 
 But inside we know the race isn't done 
 It's time to be soldiers 
 'Cause the fight isn't over 
 So we need to come closer 
 And lay all our burdens down 
 To the One who knows us 
 And the One who holds us 
 Here on this battleground 
 Lift up your head 
 The King has come 
 We know that His love 
 His love has won 
 Keep marching on 
 To the risen Son 
 His love has won 
 All through the city tonight 
 Hope's running deep, he hears our cry 
 It's time to be soldiers 
 'Cause the fight isn't over 
 So we need to come closer 
 And lay all our burdens down 
 To the One who knows us 
 And the One who holds us 
 Here on this battleground 
 Lift up your head 
 The King has come 
 We know that His love 
 His love has won 
 Keep marching on 
 To the risen Son 
 His love shines brighter than the darkest night 
 His love runs deep, His love runs wide 
 And after all is said and done 
 His love has won, we know, His love has won 
 We march to the beat of a different drum 
 We know, we know His love has won 
 We march in the light of the risen Son 
 Ooh, His love has won 
 Lift up your head 
 The King has come 
 We know that His love 
 We march to the beat of a different drum 
 We know, we know His love has won 
 We march in the light of the risen Son 
 Ooh, His love has won 
 His love has won

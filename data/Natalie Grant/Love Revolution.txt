Fading 
 We're all fading 
 From who we've become and who we were meant to be 
 Dying 
 We're all dying 
 And wanna believe its everyone but me 
 Oh great light of the world help us see 
 What can save us now 
 When hands are reaching out 
 Walls are falling down 
 It's a love revolution 
 What can save us now 
 Raising from the ground 
 We are crying out 
 For a love revolution 
 Searching, 
 We're searching 
 For something more divine to set us free 
 Holding 
 We're all holding 
 Everything inside this world needs 
 Oh great light of the world help us see 
 What can save us now 
 When hands are reaching out 
 Walls are falling down 
 It's a love revolution 
 What can save is now 
 Raising from the ground 
 We are crying out 
 For a love revolution 
 We are called to freedom 
 We are free to love 
 And love has come for us 
 And love will be enough 
 And love will be enough 
 What can save us now 
 When hands are reaching out 
 Walls are falling 
 Down Down down 
 Oh oh oh 
 Hands are reaching out 
 And walls are falling down 
 It's a love revolution 
 Oh oh oh 
 Raising from the ground 
 We are crying out 
 For a love revolution 
 We need a love a revolution 
 It's a love revolution 
 We need a love revolution

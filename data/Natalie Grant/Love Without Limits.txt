There is love that no height, no depth, nor any power could take away 
 See the faces in the crowd 
 Everyone is reaching out 
 Searching for something that's real 
 See the souls behind the eyse 
 Left with no way to disguise 
 The yearning inside 
 He loves without limits 
 Sees us every minute 
 Wherever we are walking 
 He is near 
 His spirit is relentless 
 His hope for us is endless 
 I know, I know 
 He loves without limits 
 There's no mountain that's too steep 
 There's no ocean that's too deep 
 Nothing can keep him from us 
 He's the lover of our souls 
 He's the one that makes us whole 
 Oh, don't you know 
 If we could only see how far 
 God will reach to touch our hearts 
 I know, I know nothing can separate us 
 I know, I know God's love is limitless

She was only 17 
 Wild at heart and following her dreams 
 Believing she was pretty 
 Got a ticket to the city 
 Where she'd find her place on the cover of a magazine 
 It was only a chat room, but it would lead the way 
 To the door of a man where she'd throw it all away 
 He said they'd take it slow 
 But little did she know 
 She'd be all used up by the end of the day 
 But she was strong 
 And she would survive 
 Ambition would be her drive 
 And she said... 
 I'll make a way 
 I'll do whatever it takes 
 Even though it won't be easy 
 I have a plan and though I may not understand 
 Someday, I'll make a way 
 Where did she go wrong, how did she get here? 
 Livin' hard and looking older than her years 
 Miss Little Big Town 
 Trying to hold a job down 
 Doing what she could to choke her fears 
 But she was strong 
 And she would survive 
 A spark of hope had kept her dream alive 
 And she cried... 
 I'll make a way 
 I'll do whatever it takes 
 Even though it won't be easy 
 I have a plan and though I may not understand 
 Someday, I'll make a way 
 Someday, I'll make a way 
 Walking down the road 
 In the city where she'd come with so much hope 
 Her vision had long died 
 Along with all her pride 
 And she found herself at the end of her rope 
 But she heard angels through the door 
 Of a church she'd passed a million times before 
 There was a song of heaven ringing 
 And soon she found herself believing 
 That out there maybe there was something more 
 So she bowed her head to pray 
 And said, Jesus, please make a way 
 And she heard Him say... 
 I'll make a way 
 I'll do whatever it takes 
 Even though it won't be easy 
 I have a plan and though you may not understand 
 Today, I'll make a way 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Today He'll make a way

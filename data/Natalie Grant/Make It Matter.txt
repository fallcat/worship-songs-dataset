Pack my bags and my regrets 
 Every second that I've wasted 
 Chasing after 
 My pursuit of happiness 
 Has only left me searching 
 There must be more 
 Take my life and lift me up to the sky 
 Take my dreams and help me to fly 
 On the wings of possibility 
 Come rewrite my history 
 (Till it's) only you I'm chasing after 
 Take this life and make it matter 
 Help me give more than I take 
 Let me see into somebody else's heartache 
 And be the difference love can make 
 My heart is finally finding 
 That there is more 
 Only one life to live 
 Only one love to give 
 Only one life, only one love 
 So make it, make it matter

I've been silent instead of speaking up 
 Gave my advice instead of giving love 
 I have been unfair, faithless and unkind 
 I have shut my eyes just so I would stay blind 
 It's not what I'm meant to do 
 'Cause I wanna honor You 
 Make me over, make me new 
 Make me a mirror, a reflection of You 
 Take me all apart, take me to Your heart 
 And pull me closer 
 Oh Jesus, make me over 
 Take away the pride that whispers in the dark 
 Take the stone out of the middle of my heart 
 Hidden underneath my insecurities 
 Is the servant that You've destined me to be 
 Day after precious day 
 I get in my own way 
 So make me over, make me new 
 Make me a mirror, a reflection of You 
 Take me all apart, take me to Your heart 
 And pull me closer 
 Sweet Savior, make me over 
 I am only made of Your imagining 
 I'm dust and clay on the wind 
 Wash me in the river of Your sacrifice 
 Until I'm changed, purified 
 Take me all apart, take me to Your heart 
 And pull me closer 
 My Jesus, make me over 
 Make me over 
 Make me over 
 Oh, make me over, Jesus

I know if you wanted to you could wave your hand 
 Spare me this heartache and change your plan 
 And I know when he said you could take my pain away 
 But even if you don't I pray 
 Help me want the Healer more than the healing 
 Help me want the Savior more than the saving 
 Help me want the Giver more than the giving 
 Help me want you Jesus more than anything 
 You know more than anyone that my flesh is weak 
 And you know I'd give anything for a remedy 
 And I'll ask a thousand more times to set me free today 
 Oh but even if you don't I pray 
 Help me want the Healer more than the healing 
 Help me want the Savior more than the saving 
 Help me want the Giver more than the giving 
 Oh Help me want you Jesus more than anything 
 When I'm desperate and my hearts overcome 
 All that I need you've already done 
 When I'm desperate and my hearts overcome 
 All that I need you've already done 
 Oh Jesus Help me want you more than anything 
 Help me want the Healer more than the healing 
 Help me want the Savior more than the saving 
 Help me want the Giver more than the giving 
 Help me want you Jesus more than anything 
 Help me want you Jesus more than anything

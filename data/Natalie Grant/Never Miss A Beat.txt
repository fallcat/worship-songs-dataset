You never miss a beat, beat 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 Every second of every minute 
 Every minute of every hour 
 There's not a moment that You look away 
 You never sleep, You never slumber 
 I don't even have to wonder 
 Whether You care, if You're right there 
 You've been there all along 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding on to me, me 
 And there's nothing out of Your reach 
 Nothing in my life that You don't see 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding onto me, me 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding on, holding onto me 
 The timing of Your plans are perfect 
 There's not a single need You forget 
 Nothing too small, nothing at all 
 Slips out of Your hands 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding on to me, me 
 And there's nothing out of Your reach 
 Nothing in my life that You don't see 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding onto me, me 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding on, holding onto me 
 No reason left to fear 
 Your love is always here 
 I will never be alone 
 I will never be alone 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding on to me, me 
 And there's nothing out of Your reach 
 Nothing in my life that You don't see 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding onto me, me 
 You never miss a beat, beat 
 You're holding on, holding onto me

It's a long wait at the gate 
 Just to glimpse your fate 
 Just to see whether it all works out 
 It's a long road, a heavy load 
 You gotta really want to go 
 And just let the others walk around 
 You now 
 Up and down again 
 But this time it's different 
 It took some waiting to straighten 
 Out the bend 
 In and out of luck 
 Yeah at times it was difficult 
 I got a new life baby, It takes some getting used to but... 
 No sign of any rain 
 My skies are clear today 
 I keep bracing for that hit 
 But there's not sign of it 
 No obstacles in sight 
 My skies are clear tonight (My skies are full of light) 
 I keep thinking I might see that cloud arrive 
 Oh but there's no sign of it 
 No sign of it 
 And as I look around, it's all new ground 
 The leaves on the trees touch down 
 But I'm above weightless as a dream 
 It's been a long road, a heavy load 
 I just simply had to go 
 Had to get here hard as it's been 
 In and out of luck 
 Yeah at time it was difficult 
 I got a new life baby, it takes some getting 
 Used to but...

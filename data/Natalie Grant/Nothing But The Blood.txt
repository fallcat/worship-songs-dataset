What can wash away my sin? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can make me whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 How precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow 
 No other fount I know 
 Nothing but, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 This is all my hope and peace 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 This is all my righteousness 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 How precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow 
 No other fount I know 
 Nothing but, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 This is all my hope and peace 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 This is all my righteousness 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 It's all about the blood 
 It's all about the blood of Jesus 
 Freedom is found 
 Redemption is found in the blood 
 I found my life in Your blood 
 Oh the precious blood of Jesus 
 Glory, glory this I sing 
 All my praise to You I bring 
 Glory, glory this I sing 
 All my praise to You I bring 
 Glory, glory this I sing 
 All my praise to You I bring 
 Glory, glory this I sing 
 All my praise to You I bring 
 It's nothing but, nothing but 
 Nothing but, nothing but 
 It's all because, all because 
 The blood of Jesus

The seed, it grows and somehow becomes a life 
 It moves, she knows that her baby has arrived, 
 She's so scared, but she's so blessed 
 She lays down her fear for the hope at her breast for she knows... 
 One million chains could never hold back this moment in time 
 One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means 
 Heaven and earth, they cradle the infinite Joy born on this night 
 For it only takes one Child to forever change the world 
 He stands beside her, he'd share her pain if he only knew how 
 He whispers 'I love you' as he gently strokes her brow 
 He's so scared, but he's so blessed 
 There's a thundering pride pounding deep in his chest 
 For he knows... 
 Christ is born, we are blessed 
 Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess 
 That we know... 
 This Baby cries and for the first time 
 The world hears the voice of God weep 
 Mary sings a lullaby 
 As the Hope of the nations gently falls asleep 
 She knows this is the one Child 
 To forever change the world.

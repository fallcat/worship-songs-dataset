Only You could string a strand of stars. 
 Like dewdrops in the sand. 
 Only You could bring my Heart to life, 
 With just a touch of Your hand! 
 Only You could be the flame that puts, 
 The lovelight in my eyes. 
 You can take the wrong in me, 
 And somehow make it right! 
 You're the Light that I live by, 
 You're the space where my soul flies. 
 You're the breath that I breathe. 
 You're the dream that sets me free! 
 So much more than I imagined, 
 Your love has made me see, 
 Only You could be the miracle in me! 
 Only You could make Your promise new, 
 With every day that You give. 
 Only You could make me love You more, 
 With every day that I live. 
 Only You possess the gentleness, 
 That brings me to my knees. 
 Your love is the melody, 
 That my heart longs to sing! 
 You're the Light that I live by, 
 You're the space where my soul flies. 
 You're the breath that I breathe. 
 You're the dream that sets me free! 
 So much more than I imagined, 
 Your love has made me see, 
 Only You could be the miracle in me! 
 You're the Soul in my heart's cry! 
 You're the dawn in my dark eyes! 
 Every beat of my heart, 
 You are the end, 
 You're the start! 
 You're the Light that I live by, 
 You're the space where my soul flies. 
 You're the breath that I breathe. 
 You're the dream that sets me free! 
 So much more than I imagined, 
 Your love has made me see, 
 Only You could be the miracle in me!

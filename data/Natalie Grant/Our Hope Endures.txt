You would think only so much can go wrong 
 Calamity only strikes once 
 And you assume this one has suffered her share 
 Life will be kinder from here 
 Oh, but sometimes the sun stays hidden for years 
 Sometimes the sky rains night after night 
 When will it clear? 
 But our Hope endures the worst of conditions 
 It's more than our optimism 
 Let the earth quake 
 Our Hope is unchanged 
 How do we comprehend peace within pain? 
 Or joy at a good man's wake? 
 Walk a mile with the woman whose body is racked 
 With illness, oh how can she laugh? 
 Oh, 'cause sometimes the sun stays hidden for years 
 Sometimes the sky rains night after night 
 When will it clear? 
 But our Hope endures the worst of conditions 
 It's more than our optimism 
 Let the earth quake 
 Our Hope is unchanged 
 Emmanuel, God is with us 
 El Shaddai, all sufficient 
 We never walk alone 
 And this is our hope 
 But our Hope endures the worst of conditions 
 It's more than our optimism 
 Let the earth quake 
 Our Hope is unchanged

Never let 'em see you when you're breaking 
 Never let 'em see you when you fall 
 That's how we live and that's how we try 
 Tell the world you've got it all together 
 Never let them see what's underneath 
 Cover it up with a crooked smile 
 But it only lasts for a little while 
 There's no such thing as perfect people 
 There's no such thing as a perfect life 
 So come as you are, broken and scared 
 Lift up your heart and be amazed 
 And be changed by a perfect God 
 Suddenly it's like a weight is lifted 
 When you hear the words that you are loved 
 He knows where you are and where you've been 
 And you never have to go there again 
 Who lived and died to give new life 
 To heal our imperfections 
 So look up and see out let grace be enough 
 By a perfect God [5x] 
 Be changed by a perfect God 
 Be changed

Once in darkness now in light 
 Once blind now you see 
 Once a sinner now a saint 
 Once bound now free. 
 That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall 
 That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall 
 Once a stranger now a child 
 Empty now filled 
 Once condemned now reconciled 
 Broken now healed 
 That's the power of the Cross 
 See the chains fall 
 That's the power of the Cross 
 See the chains fall 
 Once a prodigal now home 
 Once lost now found 
 Once and enemy now a friend 
 Once poor now crowned 
 That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall 
 That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall 
 See the chains 
 See your chains fall 
 See the chains 
 See your chains fall!

How did you know 
 That I'm all alone today 
 Oh I feel so scared 
 And I want to go away 
 I bleed so deep underneath 
 My soul is screaming 
 I'm not gonna hide 
 I'm not gonna run away 
 I'll uncover the scars 
 And show you every mistake 
 Your love has mended my blisters 
 And my bruising shame 
 Now I, I'm not ashamed. 
 Here with you 
 I am safe 
 Drowning the tears 
 Won't make it go away 
 It's robbing my soul 
 I'm taking this mask off my face 
 To discover love 
 And uncover all 
 It means to live and breathe 
 You've uncovered and I've discovered 
 I am not afraid 
 But when we're hiding we're only fighting 
 To be sane

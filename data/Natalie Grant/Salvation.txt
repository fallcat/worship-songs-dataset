When I was a little girl 
 I started dreamin' 'bout my place in 
 This big world 
 My mamma taught me how to be a lady 
 And my daddy, He loved me 
 But more importantly, when I was 
 Eight years old 
 Received eternity and a love that won't 
 Grow cold 
 I gotta talk about it, sing about it 
 I can't face the world without it 
 Sweet Salvation 
 It's not magical, not mystical 
 It's purely supernatural 
 Sweet, Sweet Salvation 
 Come on and sit next to me 
 I'll tell you about a man who can set you free 
 Died when he was thirty-three 
 He gave his life on calvary 
 It's undeniable; his page in history 
 So incredible, this human deity 
 Doesn't matter what your size 
 Or the kind of car you drive 
 Ask and you will receive 
 Doesn't matter where you've been 
 Or the color of your skin 
 It's free, Free, Free to all who believe

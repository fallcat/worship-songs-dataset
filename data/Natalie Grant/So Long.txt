Mystified by the struggle 
 To survive my own pride 
 Haunted by the demons 
 Of my past life 
 Who am I and why do I 
 Are questions that keep running 
 Through my mind 
 But underneath this shallow skin 
 A brand new me is comin' out, 
 Comin' out from within 
 So long 
 Farewell to my old self 
 Good-bye to the lie that I can't be someone else 
 Cause who I was ain't who I am 
 (I know that) I've been born again 
 Those stains of my history are gone, gone, gone 
 So long 
 Apathy, hunting me 
 Like some contagious disease 
 Hypocrisy hiding in the shadows 
 Of the former me 
 Doin' what comes naturally 
 I'm not who I want to be 
 I'm ready to, ready to be free 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 So long 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 So long

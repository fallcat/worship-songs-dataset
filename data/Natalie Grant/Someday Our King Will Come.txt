I remember mama praying, saying to me, girl 
 Child, you better know before you walk out in the world 
 Times are getting darker, getting hotter everyday 
 When they do, I hear mama say 
 As you get older, when it's cold you run towards the sun 
 If you feel scare and so alone you're not the only one 
 Don't be afraid when your world comes undone 
 Don't you know that someday our King will come? 
 As I keep growing, He keeps showing me strength 
 Even when the world is changing He will stay the same 
 He loves me like a father and this hands will provide 
 Takes away every fear inside 
 As you get older, when it's cold you run towards the sun 
 If you feel scare and so alone you're not the only one 
 Don't be afraid when your world comes undone 
 Don't you know that someday our King will come? 
 All the time has passed, days to months to years 
 When we hear His voice He'll open every deafening 
 Everybody's gonna hear you 
 As you get older, when it's cold keep running towards the sun 
 You're not alone, you're not the only one 
 Don't be afraid when your world comes undone 
 Don't you know that someday, someday our King's gonna come? 
 As you get older, when it's cold you run towards the sun 
 If you feel scare and so alone you're not the only one 
 Don't be afraid when your world comes undone 
 Someday I know our King's gonna come 
 Someday, someday, our King will come 
 Someday, someday, someday 
 Don't be afraid 
 Someday our King will come 
 Sing it now 
 Someday, someday, someday 
 He's gonna come again 
 Someday, someday, someday 
 He's coming back for me 
 Someday our King will come 
 Someday our King will come 
 Someday our King will come

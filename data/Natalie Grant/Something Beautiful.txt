This is a song for anyone whose ever been 
 Knocked down ; can't get back again 
 Stuck in the corner, can't move forward 
 All alone and you think you're going nowhere 
 This is a song for anyone whose ever stood 
 Underneath the sun and felt so small- 
 Two feet tall and so out of place 
 He sees you - he knows you - he loves you 
 And he wants you to know that 
 The life you've been livin', the days that 
 You've been givin' 
 Were made for something beautiful 
 Life - Don't let it pass you by 
 Because you were created for somethin' beautiful 
 Heaven holds a dream that's just for you 
 There are things only you can do 
 So step by faith, put the past away 
 It'll take you to a better day 
 Seconds to minutes to hours to life 
 Time always seem to fly 
 It's on the go and before you know 
 Your days are through 
 But he sees you - he knows you - he loves you 
 And he wants you to know that 
 What are - you waiting for 
 What are you - waiting for 
 What - are you waiting for 
 There's something beautiful

Natalie Grant-Song To The King Lyrics 
 You came to the world 
 For Love of one Like Me 
 And Though I am the worst of sinners 
 Grace is all I see 
 Freedom from these chains 
 My brokenness redeemed 
 Love and Mercy flowing down 
 To life eternally 
 How could I repay such a debt 
 Except with my life 
 How could I give anything but sacrifice 
 Sacrifice of praise 
 Chorus: To the King Eternal, immortal 
 Be all the glory forever Amen 
 To the King Eternal, immortal 
 Be all the glory forever Amen 
 In plenty and want 
 Your strength is all I need 
 And deep within these shadow lands 
 Your glory never leaves 
 Chorus: My Praise will go on and on and on 
 My Praise will go on and on and on 
 My Praise will go on and on 
 Oh my Praise will go on 
 Oh my Praise will go on and on and on 
 My Praise will go on and on 
 My Praise will go on and on 
 Oh and on and on and on and on and on 
 And on and on and on 
 To the King eternal, immortal 
 Be all the glory forever Amen 
 To the King eternal, immortal 
 Be all the glory forever Amen 
 To the King eternal, immortal 
 Be all the glory forever Amen 
 To the King eternal, immortal 
 Be all the glory forever Amen 
 I'm giving all of me 
 This is my offering

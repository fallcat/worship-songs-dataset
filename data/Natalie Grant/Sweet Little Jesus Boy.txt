Sweet little Jesus boy 
 They made you be born in a manger 
 Sweet little holy child 
 Didn't know who You were 
 Didn't know you come to save us, Lord 
 To take our sins away 
 Our eyes was blind, we couldn't see 
 We didn't know who You were 
 You have told us how 
 We are trying 
 Master you have shown us how 
 Even when you were dying 
 Just seems like we can't do right 
 Look how we treated you 
 But please Sir forgive us Lord 
 We didn't know it was you 
 Sweet little Jesus Boy 
 Born a long time ago 
 Sweet little Holy Child 
 We didn't know who You were 
 We didn't know who You were.

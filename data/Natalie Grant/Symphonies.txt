I've been in this place before 
 Knees to the ground on the valley floor 
 Here in the shadows, here in the unknown 
 Nothing here worth singing for 
 I can feel the silence fall 
 Here in the shadows, here in the unknown 
 On, and on, and on and on 
 Nothing's gonna steal my song 
 On, and on, and on, and on 
 I will bring you 
 Symphonies, symphonies 
 Over and over with every breath I breathe 
 Symphonies, symphonies 
 Over and over, every single heart beat 
 Sing my soul, singing, sing my song 
 I'm bringing symphonies, symphonies 
 I won't let my fear resound 
 Chaos, you won't drown me out 
 Even the downpour, is gonna hear my soul roar 
 Beyond what I can see ahead 
 Beyond what hasn't happened yet 
 Even the raging storm, is gonna know my voice 
 On, and on, and on and on 
 Nothing's gonna steal my song 
 On, and on, and on, and on 
 I will bring you 
 Symphonies, symphonies 
 Over and over with every breath I breathe 
 Symphonies, symphonies 
 Over and over, every single heart beat 
 Sing my soul, singing, sing my song 
 I'm bringing symphonies, symphonies 
 When I can't find the words to say 
 Teach my heart your melody 
 Sing my soul, sing my soul 
 Sing my soul sing my soul 
 When I can't take another step 
 Breathe in me, another breath 
 Sing my soul, sing my soul 
 Sing my soul, sing my soul 
 On, and on, and on and on 
 Nothing's gonna steal my song 
 On, and on, and on, and on 
 I will bring you 
 I'm gonna bring, I'm gonna bring 
 I'm gonna bring you, gonna bring you, all my praise 
 Symphonies, symphonies 
 Over and over with every breath I breathe 
 Symphonies, symphonies 
 Over and over, every single heart beat 
 Sing my soul, singing, sing my song 
 I'm bringing symphonies, symphonies

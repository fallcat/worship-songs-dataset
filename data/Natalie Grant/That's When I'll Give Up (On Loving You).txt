No heartbeat is always steady 
 Angels have halos already 
 Please- don't think you're proving 
 Yourself all the time 
 I don't need you to be perfect 
 I know the wait will be worth it 
 You and me baby we're only just 
 Learning to shine 
 You should know 
 This my love 
 How far I'll go 
 Here's when I'll give up 
 When the sun is coming up at midnight 
 When the clocks have all run out of time 
 When the snow- falls in June 
 That's when I'll give up (on loving you) 
 When the earth is finished spinning around 
 When it's raining up instead of down 
 When a dream-can't come true 
 When the rivers all run out of blue 
 That's when I'll give up (on loving you) 
 You'll never run out of chances 
 I don't need you to have all the answers 
 Love isn't something that has to be 
 Put to the test 
 Love like this 
 Can't be undone 
 I'm telling you 
 If the day should come 
 As you're walking through the world 
 You gotta know 
 I'll be with you everywhere you go 
 You can spread your wings or run 
 Back to my arms 
 I will always hold you in my heart- baby 
 You'll always be 
 A part of me 
 Baby can't you see

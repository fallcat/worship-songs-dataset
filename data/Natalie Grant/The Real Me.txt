Foolish heart looks like we're here again 
 Same old game of plastic smile 
 Don't let anybody in 
 Hiding my heartache, will this glass house break 
 How much will they take before I'm empty 
 Do I let it show, does anybody know? 
 But you see the real me 
 Hiding my skin, broken from within 
 Unveil me completely 
 I'm loosening my grasp 
 There's no need to mask my frailty 
 Cause you see the real me 
 Painted on, life is behind the mask 
 Self-inflicted circus clown 
 I'm tired of the song and dance 
 Living a charade, always on parade 
 What a mess I've made of my existence 
 But you love me even now 
 And still I see somehow 
 Wonderful, beautiful is what you see 
 When you look at me 
 You're turning the tattered fabric of my life into 
 A perfect tapestry 
 I just wanna be me 
 And you love me just as I am 
 Wonderful, beautiful is what you see 
 When you look at me

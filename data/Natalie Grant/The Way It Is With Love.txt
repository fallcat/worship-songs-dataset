Inside of every heart, there is a seed 
 My mama watered mine, and raised me to be 
 A rose, a rose, or some greater thing 
 Mama, you're beautiful to me 
 Oh my Daddy, I want you to know 
 Your little, baby girl became that rose 
 The bloom, the bloom blushed deeper red 
 With every drop of sacrifice you bled 
 There's no growing without any pain 
 There's no flowers without the rain 
 We are bound together by blood that's flowing through us 
 And that's the way it is with love 
 I have a vision, a hope and a dream 
 I see a hill, across a healing stream 
 Where the Rose arose, to set us free 
 And the Cross became a family tree 
 Circle of God comes around 
 And turns us into special things, somehow 
 And one day we'll hold little flowers of our own 
 And we'll sacrifice so that they can grow

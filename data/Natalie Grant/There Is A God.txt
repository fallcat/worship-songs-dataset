For as long as I remember 
 Ever since I was a child 
 I've had the understanding in my heart 
 That there is a Creator, a Master of design 
 Who hung the moon and every single star 
 But the greatest revelation that I could ever know 
 He loves me in my weakness 
 And calls me His own 
 I have a hope, and I believe 
 My faith is alive, my spirit is free 
 Though He's unseen, still I know deep within my soul 
 There is a God 
 In the arms of human nature 
 I've fallen on the way 
 He's heard the desperation of my cry 
 Oh, one drink of living water, can heal the hurt inside 
 He fills my cup, it never will run dry 
 For the price of my redemption is covered by the blood 
 And I have been made worthy 
 By His gift of love 
 Father of Light 
 He never changes, He never fails 
 Giver of grace, author of life 
 He paid the price, so I can say 
 I have a hope, and I believe 
 My faith is alive, He's living in me 
 There is a God 
 I do believe, I do believe 
 There is a God 
 He's the way, the truth, the life 
 There is a God 
 His name is Jesus

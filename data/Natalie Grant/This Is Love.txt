Where there's hatred 
 Show love, show love 
 Weak and broken 
 Lift them up, lift them up 
 If there's despair, breathe in the peace 
 Help heal the wounds of another 
 Where darkness lives, bring forth the light 
 Release the chains 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Let your light speak out loud 
 This love 
 This is love 
 Let the heavens come down 
 So, give, give, give it away 
 Give it away, let mercy reign 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Hope is raising 
 There is joy, there is joy 
 It's in dying 
 We are born, we are born 
 And as we give, so we receive 
 The grace to pardon another 
 Redeemed by Him who shatters pain 
 And shines the way 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Let your light speak out loud 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Let the heavens come down 
 So, give, give, give it away 
 Give it away, let mercy reign 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Be an instrument of Truth 
 Live it out, let words be few 
 Let our lives be living proof 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Let your light speak out loud 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Let the heavens come down 
 So, give, give, give it away 
 Give it away, let mercy reign 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 This is love 
 Let our lives be living proof 
 This is love 
 This is love

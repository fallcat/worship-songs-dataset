Sometimes my heart gets weak, 
 Sometimes my soul feels the edge of the night. 
 Sometimes my will, my foolish pride, 
 Carries me far, far away from Your side! 
 And when I lose my way, I know... 
 I look to You to find my strength. 
 Carry me to the end of my days! 
 A steady hand to lead me through, 
 Arms of faith to bring me back to You! 
 I will keep my eyes on love, 
 Set my heart on things above! 
 When my soul is so afraid, 
 I look to You to find my strength! 
 Sometimes my hope, it slips away. 
 Sometimes my dreams come crashing down! 
 Sometimes my life, this crazy life, 
 Has a heart, has a heart of its own! 
 And when I lose my way, 
 You know 
 I look to You to find my strength. 
 Carry me to the end of my days! 
 A steady hand to lead me through, 
 Arms of faith to bring me back to You! 
 I will keep my eyes on love, 
 Set my heart on things above! 
 When my soul is so afraid, 
 I look to You to find my strength! 
 When the tears keep pouring down, 
 And my lips can't make a sound, 
 I know You hear my prayer, 
 And Your strength is always there! 
 I look to You to find my strength. 
 Carry me to the end of my days! 
 A steady hand to lead me through, 
 Arms of faith to bring me back to You! 
 I will keep my eyes on love, 
 Set my heart on things above! 
 When my soul is so afraid, 
 I look to You to find my strength! 
 And when I lose my way, I know

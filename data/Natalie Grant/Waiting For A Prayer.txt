He's given hope through the ages 
 Give sight to the blind 
 Brought understanding to sages 
 And peace to troubled minds 
 To humble hearts, who will call His name 
 To all who will believe 
 He's watching with angels, He's ready to fly 
 One word, just a whisper, He's there 
 Knock and He'll open, seek and you'll find 
 Call on His name, He's the answer 
 Waiting for a prayer 
 He'll give you faith like a fire 
 To keep your feet on the path 
 And if it's mercy you require 
 He'll be the touch of Healing Hands 
 To humble hearts, who will call His name 
 To all who will believe 
 Fall on your knees and believe 
 The Father hears you when you pray 
 Anytime, night or day 
 And He will say 
 I'm watching with angels, I'm ready to fly 
 One word, just a whisper, I'll be there 
 Knock and He'll open, seek and you'll find 
 Call on His name, He's the answer 
 Waiting for a prayer

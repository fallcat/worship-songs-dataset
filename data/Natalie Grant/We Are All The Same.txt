My life is filled with joy and tears 
 Just like somebody, ten thousand miles from here 
 We stand, a half a world apart 
 Looking up at the same stars 
 We're the fellowship of the unashamed 
 Children in our Savior's eyes 
 Praying for God's touch 
 To guide us through our different lives 
 'Cause everybody needs His perfect love 
 Just like every flower needs the rain 
 Reminding us, the whole world over 
 We are all the same 
 And God is reaching out His hand to us 
 As all across the earth we call His name 
 Reminding us, the whole world over 
 Deep at heart, we are all the same 
 His love has opened up our eyes 
 Closing the distance, between our different lives 
 And His grace fills every step we take 
 As we walk on in faith 
 No matter who or where we are 
 He will be our common ground 
 Take all the walls we build 
 And bring them crashing down 
 So, let us thank for His love we've come to know 
 We know we will never face this world alone

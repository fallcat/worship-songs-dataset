Sometimes I get that overwhelming feeling 
 So sad those faces on TV 
 If I tried to make a difference would I help anyways 
 But then I stop and to myself I say 
 So you wanna change the world 
 What are you waiting for 
 You say you're gonna start right now 
 What are you waiting for 
 It only takes one voice 
 So come on now and shout it out 
 Give a little more 
 What are you waiting for 
 Sometimes I feel a little helpless 
 Seems like I can't do a thing 
 But anything is possible just you wait and see 
 Good things happen if you just believe 
 Someday somehow 
 Gonna take that step 
 Cause time is ticking away 
 Right here right now 
 Before it's too late 
 Gonna face tomorrow today

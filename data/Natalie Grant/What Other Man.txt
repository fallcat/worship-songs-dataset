I never feel You far away, 
 When others leave I know You'll stay. 
 I hear You speak inside my heart, 
 It's then I'll know we'll never part. 
 You always give me everything, 
 And Your love has never left my side. 
 You've been there in my darkest night, 
 You're my strength when I want to hide. 
 And what other man would give every thing He has? 
 Speak with love in what He says? 
 Lay down His all to set me free? 
 What other man, would give His life for me? 
 Only Your love for me will do, 
 I've known the thrill of loving You. 
 All of my dreams I hold inside, 
 I'll give them to You to realize' 
 You always give me everything, 
 And Your love has never left my side. 
 You've been there in my darkest night, 
 You're my strength when I want to hide. 
 And what other man would give every though He has? 
 Speak with love in what He says? 
 Lay down His all to set me free? 
 What other man, would give His life for me? 
 You built me a wall, 
 To keep me from harm. 
 When life is cold, 
 He'll keep me warm. 
 And what other man would give every though He has? 
 Speak with love in what He says? 
 Lay down His all to set me free? 
 What other man, would give His life for me?

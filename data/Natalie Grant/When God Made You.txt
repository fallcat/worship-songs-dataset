It's always been a mystery to me 
 How two hearts can come together 
 And love can last forever 
 But now that I have found you, I believe 
 That a miracle has come 
 When God sends the perfect one 
 Now gone are all my questions about why 
 And I've never been so sure of anything in my life 
 I wonder what God was thinking 
 When He created you 
 I wonder if He knew everything I would need 
 Because He made all my dreams come true 
 When God made you 
 He must have been thinking about me 
 I promise that wherever you may go 
 Wherever life may lead you 
 With all my heart I'll be there too 
 From this moment I want you to know 
 Ill let nothing come between us 
 And I will love the ones you love 
 Now gone are all my question about why 
 And I've never been so sure of anything in my life 
 He made the sun He made the moon 
 To harmonize in perfect tune 
 One can't move without the other 
 They just have to be together 
 And that is why I know its true 
 You're for me and I'm for you 
 Cause my world just can't be right 
 Without you in my life

 He mustve heard every prayer I've been praying 
 Yes He knew everything I would need 
 When God made you 
 When dreams come true 
 When God made you 
 He mustve been thinking about me

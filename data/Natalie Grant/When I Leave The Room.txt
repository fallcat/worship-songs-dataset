Good night 
 Looks like we made it through the day 
 The moon sighs 
 And I know that we're okay 
 Sleep tight 
 I love to watch you drift away 
 I would come with you but on my knees I'll stay 
 Good night 
 Five little fingers holding mine 
 Take flight 
 Into your dreams and lullabies 
 There's nothing more that I can do 
 But just fall more in love with you 
 And ask the angel armies to stand by 
 When I leave the room 
 I'm gonna fail you 
 I already have 
 Ten thousand times 
 I will fall down flat 
 You'll have a seat in the front row 
 Of everything I don't know 
 And all I'm trying to be 
 You'll see 
 Good night 
 There will be storms that we come through 
 In time 
 We will slay dragons me and you 
 I'll always wanna hold you tight 
 Keep you safe with all my might 
 So I will leave Jesus next to you 
 When I leave the room 
 And you will run ahead 
 As if you know the way 
 And I will pray more 
 Then one should have to pray 
 There will be words we can't take back 
 Silences too 
 And I'll be on my knees 
 You'll see 
 One night 
 When I am old and unsteady 
 You'll want me to fight 
 But I'll tell you that I'm ready 
 When there's nothing left to do 
 I will still be loving you 
 Then you'll fold your fingers into mine 
 And I will let Jesus hold you tight 
 When I leave the room

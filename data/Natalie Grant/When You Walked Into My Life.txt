When you walked into my life 
 I waited all this time 
 Count minutes as they pass 
 Searching for a sign 
 Wishing for the best 
 And just when I thought my chances was gone 
 You came to me with open arms 
 Like a miracle out of the blue 
 You rescue me when I turn to you 
 You shook the heaven and cracked the skies 
 When you walked, when you walked into my life 
 When you appeared 
 Like sight to the blind 
 Like music to my ears 
 Like a reason to a rhyme 
 Just when my hope was weary thin 
 You turn my heart to love again 
 Like a miracle out of the blue 
 You rescue me when I turn to you 
 You shook the heaven and cracked the skies 
 When you walked, when you walked into my life 
 You spoke my name and the word began again 
 You touch my heart and it open

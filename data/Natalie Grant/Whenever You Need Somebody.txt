I know that life seems hard, cruel and unkind 
 A lonesome journey with questions in your mind 
 I'll hold your weary hand as you walk down the road 
 Remember you're never alone 
 Whenever you need somebody 
 Whenever you want someone 
 To reach out and touch you 
 With a love that is strong 
 Whenever you need somebody 
 Whenever you want a friend 
 To chase away the clouds and help the sun shine again 
 I will be that friend 
 If I could have one wish this I would pray 
 A heavenly miracle, your pain to drift away 
 So I'll keep on prayin' until that day comes 
 Remember that I'll be the one 
 Whenever you need somebody 
 Whenever you want someone 
 To reach out and touch you 
 With a love that is strong 
 Whenever you need somebody 
 Whenever you want a friend 
 To chase away the clouds and help the sun shine again 
 I will be that friend 
 I'll give you strength in times you're feeling weak 
 I'll give you hope and help you to believe

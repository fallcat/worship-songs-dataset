Always looking for a sign 
 A burning bush, a flash of light 
 To show me what to do 
 A voice coming from the clouds 
 That'll knock me to the ground 
 So there's no doubt it's You 
 You calling my name 
 You pointing the way 
 So I don't have to choose 
 There's no need to pray 
 I don't want to wait on You 
 I'm always looking for the lightning 
 For the thunder crashing down 
 I'm always wanting easy answers 
 Wanna hear You speak out loud 
 I keep wanting something bigger 
 Sometimes I miss Your whisper 
 I don't ever slow it down 
 Stop the wheels from going 'round 
 Can't hear You through the noise 
 You'd think I would learn 
 To take You at Your word 
 And know Your still small voice 
 Calling my name 
 Pointing the way 
 One step at a time 
 I know I should pray 
 I know I should wait on You 
 But I'm always looking for the lightning 
 For the thunder crashing down 
 I'm always wanting easy answers 
 Wanna hear You speak out loud 
 I keep wanting something bigger 
 Sometimes I miss Your whisper 
 It isn't always obvious 
 Sometimes I gotta learn to trust 
 Let it go and listen up 
 I don't wanna miss Your whisper 
 I'm always looking for the lightning 
 For the thunder crashing down 
 I'm always wanting easy answers 
 Wanna hear You speak out loud 
 I keep wanting something bigger 
 Sometimes I miss Your whisper 
 I don't wanna miss Your whisper

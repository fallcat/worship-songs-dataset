When I feel the worlds against me 
 Left me in the cold 
 Thinking I've been forgotten 
 Out there on my own 
 I close my eyes and in the silence 
 Hear a voice so clear 
 Reminding me your love 
 Is always right here 
 Within me-then all of my doubts disappear 
 And there's nothing to fear- your loves 
 Within me 
 You gave me strength to believe 
 That all that I am and all that I'll ever need is 
 Within me 
 When my spirit's all but broken 
 I'm humbled to the bone 
 Searching for the grace 
 To find my way home 
 I take a breath, a slow deep breath 
 And feel a sense of calm 
 Then the hurt in my heart is suddenly gone 
 Within me you wiped away all my tears 
 There's nothing to fear- your love's within me 
 It gives me the strength to believe 
 That all that I am and all that I'll ever need is 
 Within me

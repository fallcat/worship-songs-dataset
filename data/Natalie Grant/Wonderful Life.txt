Beautiful is in the sky 
 Watch it slowly 
 All our time is flying by, too fast 
 Where we're headed is so clear 
 To somewhere higher 
 And anything we want is here, right now 
 'Cause the sun is shining 
 And the world is alive... and 
 Everything's all right 
 And all you ever needed 
 It's a perfect day to be alive 
 So no more waiting now 
 For a wonderful life 
 'Cause it's a wonderful life right now 
 Beautiful is in the eyes 
 Of a friend or a stranger 
 Souls searching in disguise, for love 
 We're all planning our escape 
 To something higher 
 Looking for a better way to feel 
 But the sun is shining 
 And the whole wide world is alive 
 (Instrumental) 
 And the sun is shining 
 And it's so good to feel alive

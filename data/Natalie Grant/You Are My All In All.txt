You are my strength when I am weak 
 You are the treasure that I seek 
 You are my all in all 
 Seeking You as a precious jewel 
 Lord, to give up I'd be a fool 
 You are my all in all 
 Taking my sin, my cross, my shame 
 Rising up again I bless Your name 
 You are my all in all 
 When I fall down You pick me up 
 When I am dry You fill my cup 
 You are my all in all 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 Worthy is Your name 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 Worthy is Your name 
 You are my strength when I am weak 
 You are the treasure that I seek 
 You are my all in all 
 Seeking You as a precious jewel 
 Lord, to give up I'd be a fool 
 You are my all in all 
 Taking my sin, my cross, my shame 
 Rising up again I bless Your name 
 You are my all in all 
 When I fall down You pick me up 
 When I get dry You fill my cup 
 You are my all in all 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 Worthy is Your name 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 Worthy is Your name

How can I come bringing no more than this 
 You are the Lord your wrapped in holyness 
 Here I am before you now, here I am 
 You deserve every mountain falling 
 You deserve every ocean reaching 
 You deserve all creation crying out your worth 
 You deserve all of heaven singing 
 You deserve every nation rising 
 I have heard all you want is my love 
 How can I be the one your heart aches for 
 Still can't believe you say that I am yours 
 Here I am before you now, Here I am 
 You deserve every mountain falling 
 You deserve every ocean reaching 
 You deserve all creation crying out your worth 
 You deserve all of heaven singing 
 You deserve every nation rising 
 I have heard all you want is my love 
 You deserve every mountain falling 
 You deserve every ocean reaching 
 You deserve all creation crying out your worth 
 You deserve all of heaven singing 
 You deserve every nation rising 
 I have heard all you want is my love

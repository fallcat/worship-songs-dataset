I stand in awe 
 That you know my name 
 Just a glimpse of your love for me 
 And now I am changed 
 Becuz you showed me how to walk a different way 
 I have peace like I never known 
 I am living 
 You move me 
 Lord you move me 
 There's a fire burning in my soul 
 And its flowing through me 
 Lord you move me 
 Lord you move me 
 Now I must tell the world what I know 
 You move me 
 For too many years I have been color blind 
 Only saw in shades of gray 
 Stuck in black and white 
 But by grace you opened my eyes 
 Now I see the light 
 And your love has covered my world 
 And makes my soul cry 
 Day after day I'm amazed that you gave your life for me. 
 When I think of the price that you paid 
 How can I not say 
 You move me 
 Yeah yeah 
 You move me 
 You move me 
 Yes you do 
 Oh your love amazes me 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 You move me. 
 Yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah

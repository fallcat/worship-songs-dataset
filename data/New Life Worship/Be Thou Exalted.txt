Be Thou my vision, be Thou my joy 
 My providence and my reward 
 Be Thou the wisdom that I employ 
 To trade my worth for Yours 
 Be Thou my refuge, be Thou my strength 
 Should my confession be 
 My heart shall whisper of sure amen 
 And trust Your every word 
 Be Thou exalted, Jesus, forever 
 Be Thou exalted forever 
 Be Thou my passion, be Thou my zeal 
 That I may offer Thee 
 No great procession or vain appeal 
 But my sincerity 
 Hallelujah to the name of all names 
 Hallelujah, to our God be all praise 
 Ever holy, worthy 
 Be Thou exalted always

The sun pales compared to you 
 The stars shine to worship you 
 But you want what I can bring 
 So I am the offering 
 Oh how amazing 
 Love beyond explaining 
 You are beautiful in your holiness 
 Ever merciful 
 Great and glorious 
 Indescribable in your majesty 
 All too wonderful for my eyes to see 
 You are beautiful 
 Your face is all I seek 
 And your gaze will always be 
 My treasure and my reward 
 The one thing I'm living for 
 Oh how amazing 
 Love beyond explaining 
 You are beautiful in your holiness 
 Ever merciful 
 Great and glorious 
 Indescribable in your majesty 
 All too wonderful for my eyes to see 
 You are beautiful 
 You are beautiful 
 You are beautiful 
 You are beautiful 
 You are beautiful in your holiness 
 Ever merciful 
 Great and glorious 
 Indescribable in your majesty 
 All too wonderful for my eyes to see 
 You are beautiful in your holiness 
 Ever merciful 
 Great and glorious 
 Indescribable in your majesty 
 All too wonderful for my eyes to see 
 You are beautiful 
 You are beautiful

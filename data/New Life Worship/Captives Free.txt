The Spirit of God is on us 
 We will preach good news 
 We will preach good news 
 And bind up the brokenhearted 
 And set the captives free 
 (Repeat 2x) 
 Glory to the Lamb 
 Who died and rose again 
 Exalted over all 
 Our Messiah reigns 
 Every knee will bow 
 A thousand tongues will sing 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Jesus our Messiah reigns

Prophesy, come to life 
 Oh my soul sing 
 Through the night, lift your eyes 
 Oh my soul cry out, cry out 
 Living King, live in me 
 Let my heart know 
 Rushing wind, move within 
 Speak to these dry bones, dry bones 
 Oh Lord, speak into the silence 
 Breathe upon the lifeless 
 Wake us up from slumber 
 Oh Lord, move in by Your Spirit 
 Your life living in us 
 Take us back to wonder 
 By Your hand, I will stand 
 Filled with glory 
 Hold Your Word, on the earth 
 All to show Your life revealed 
 Dry bones, dance 
 Dry bones, sing 
 Dry bones, stand up and get up and live 
 Dry bones, run 
 Dry bones, rise 
 Dry bones, stand up and come back to life 
 We prophesy for the authority of heaven 
 The authority of heaven and earth is in us 
 Jesus won back the keys, the keys to the kingdom of God 
 We prophesy for the dry bones to get up and live 
 The authority that you have given us, God 
 We command life into the dead places, We command life from sickness 
 Come life from addiction no more, Come life from shame, from pain no more

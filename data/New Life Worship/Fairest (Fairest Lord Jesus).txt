Thee will I cherish 
 Thee will I honor 
 Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown 
 Fairest Lord Jesus 
 Ruler of all nature 
 Oh, Thou of God and man the son 
 Thee will I cherish 
 Thee will I honor 
 Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown 
 Fair are the meadows 
 Fairer still the woodlands 
 Robed in the blumming garb of spring 
 Oh, my Jesus is fairer 
 Jesus is purer 
 Who makes the woeful heart to sing 
 You are fairer than the fairest of ten thousand 
 Lovelier than all I've ever seen 
 You are brighter than the brightest star in heaven 
 Jesus, You're everything to me 
 Jesus, You're everything to me 
 Fair is the sunshine 
 Fairer still the moonlight 
 And all the twinkling starry hosts 
 Jesus shines brighter 
 Jesus shines purer 
 Than all the angels heaven can boast 
 You are fairer than the fairest of ten thousand 
 Lovelier than all I've ever seen 
 You are brighter than the brightest star in heaven 
 Jesus, You're everything to me 
 Jesus, You're everything to me 
 You are fairer than the fairest of ten thousand 
 Lovelier than all I've ever seen 
 You are brighter than the brightest star in heaven 
 Jesus, You're everything to me 
 Jesus, You're everything to me 
 Beautiful Savior 
 Lord of all nations 
 Son of God and Son of Man 
 Glory and Honor 
 Praise, Adoration 
 Now and forevermore be Thine

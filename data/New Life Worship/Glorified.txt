Praise belongs to You 
 Let every kingdom bow 
 Let every ocean roar 
 Let every heart adore You now 
 Praise belongs to You 
 What can I do but sing 
 The greatest joy I've found 
 Is to lay a crown before my King 
 Before my King 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to lift up Your name 
 For You deserve this 
 Life laid down like the one that You gave 
 I have but one voice 
 One heart and one sacrifice 
 So won't you take this 
 Life laid down and be glorified, be glorified 
 Praise belongs to You 
 Let songs and children rise 
 You silence all Your foes 
 You set Your glory in the skies 
 Praise belongs to you creation calling out 
 For the King to be revealed 
 Oh King of Heaven come down 
 King of Heaven come down 
 'Cause I've come to worship 
 I've come to lift up Your name 
 For You deserve this 
 Life laid down like the one that You gave 
 I have but one voice 
 One heart and one sacrifice 
 So would you take this 
 Life laid down and be glorified, be glorified 
 Be glorified, be glorified 
 I've come to worship 
 I've come to lift up Your name 
 For You deserve this 
 Life laid down like the one that You gave 
 I have but one voice 
 One heart and one sacrifice 
 So would you take this 
 Life laid down and be glorified, be glorified 
 Be glorified, be glorified 
 (Be glorified) 
 I've come to worship 
 (Be glorified) 
 I've come to lift up Your name 
 (Be glorified) 
 For You deserve this 
 Life laid down like the one that You gave 
 (Be glorified) 
 I have but one voice 
 One heart and one sacrifice 
 (Be glorified) 
 So would you take this 
 Life laid down and be glorified

Across the earth we see 
 Worshippers believe 
 Hear our song 
 Praise to our God 
 Praise to our God 
 From dawn till dusk we'll be 
 Lifting up our King 
 Hear our song 
 Praise to our God 
 Praise to our God 
 PRE-Bringing honour to Your majesty 
 There's no other like the King of all kings 
 God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome Name 
 All creation rising up to say 
 "We know our God reigns!" 
 Our broken lives were changed 
 When You broke the night with day 
 Hear our song 
 Praise to our God 
 Praise to our God 
 (PRE-) 
 God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome Name 
 All creation rising up to say 
 "We know our God reigns!" 
 Singing, God be praised 
 All the glory to Your awesome Name 
 Though the earth will shake and battles rage 
 We know our God reigns! 
 Out of ashes You lifted us 
 To the table You came and filled our cup 
 Ev'ry heart and soul, all we are and more 
 Praise the Lord! 
 Out of ashes You lifted us 
 To the table You came and filled our cup 
 Ev'ry heart and soul, all we are and more 
 Praise the Lord! 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 Our God reigns 
 (Repeat)

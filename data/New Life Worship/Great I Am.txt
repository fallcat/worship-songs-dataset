I wanna to be close close to your side 
 So heaven is real and death is a lie 
 I wanna hear voices of angels above 
 Singing as one 
 Hallelujah Holy Holy 
 God almighty Great I am 
 Who is worthy 
 None beside Thee 
 God Almighty 
 Great I Am 
 I wanna be near near to your heart 
 Loving the world hating the dark 
 I want to see dry bones living again 
 Singing as one 
 Hallelujah 
 Holy Holy 
 God almighty Great I am 
 Who is worthy 
 None beside Thee 
 God Almighty 
 Great I Am 
 He's the Great I Am Great I Am 
 The mountains shake before Him 
 The demons run and flee 
 At the mention of the name 
 King of Majesty 
 There is no power in hell 
 Or any who can stand 
 Before the power and the presence of the Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am The Great I am 
 Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am The Great I am 
 The mountains shake before Him 
 The demons run and flee 
 At the mention of the name 
 King of Majesty 
 There is no power in hell 
 Or any who can stand 
 Before the power and the presence of the Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am The Great I am 
 The Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am 
 The Great I am The Great I am The Great I am

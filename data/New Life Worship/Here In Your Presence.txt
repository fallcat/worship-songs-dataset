Found in Your hands, fullness of joy 
 Every fear suddenly wiped away 
 Here in Your presence 
 All of my gains now fade away 
 Every crown no longer on display 
 Here in Your presence 
 Heaven is trembling in awe of Your wonders 
 The kings and their kingdom 
 Are standing amazed 
 Here in Your presence 
 We are undone 
 Here in Your presence 
 Heaven and earth become one 
 Here in Your presence 
 All things are new 
 Here in Your presence 
 Everything bows before You 
 Wonderful, beautiful, glorious 
 Matchless in every way 
 Wonderful, beautiful, glorious 
 Matchless in every way

It's the heartbeat of God 
 It's the rhythm and reason for love 
 The pow'r of the cross 
 It's the beginning for all who are lost 
 Yeah it's real 
 Yeah it's real 
 Yeah it's more than what we feel 
 Yeah it's true 
 Yeah it's true 
 That we are free 
 And we will dance, dance the dust off the floor 
 And we will sing till our lungs give out 
 And we can't sing anymore 
 We will shout, let it out like a lion and roar 
 There's so much more to this life 
 Our freedom is, our freedom is in Christ 
 It's the breaking of chains 
 He's the Life and the Truth and the Way 
 The hope that we live 
 There's no battle we're fighting in vain 
 You set us free

Lift the Name of Jesus high 
 Lift the Name of Jesus high 
 Lift the Name of Jesus high 
 Lift the Name of Jesus high 
 God gave ev'rything to us 
 So ev'rything we have is not really ours but His 
 Let's take this moment of our day 
 Turn it into praise, offer it as a gift 
 To our King, to our Lord 
 For He reigns evermore 
 Praise and worship are Yours 
 Heaven and earth sing for joy 
 Like an eagle takes the sky 
 Let Your Name be lifted high 
 Over nations and kings 
 Over death we can sing 
 Jesus, glorified 
 Let Your Name be lifted high 
 God gave His one and only Son 
 To come as one of us and die so we might live 
 Let's take this moment of our day 
 Turn it into praise, and offer it as a gift 
 To our King, to our Lord 
 For He reigns evermore 
 Lift the Name of Jesus high 
 Lift the Name of Jesus high 
 Lift the Name of Jesus high 
 Jesus let Your Name be lifted high

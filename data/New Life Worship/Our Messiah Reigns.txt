You broke the curse of death 
 For You You are the Risen One 
 Heaven and earth will be made new 
 For You are the Chosen One 
 You are Messiah the world's true Lord 
 We lift You higher as we cry out 
 Glory to the Lamb who died and rose again 
 Exalted over all our Messiah reigns 
 Ev'ry knee will bow a thousand tongues will sing 
 Holy is the Lord Jesus our Messiah reigns 
 You rescue the prisoner 
 For You You are the Saving One 
 You comfort the broken and the poor 
 For You are the Promised One

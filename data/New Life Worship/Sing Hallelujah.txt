Oh what a beautiful song when we lift up our hearts 
 And we lift up our hands 
 Oh what a glorious noise we will make with our voice 
 When we call on Your name 
 Praise, we give You praise 
 Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah 
 Great, great is Your name 
 Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah 
 Oh what a wonderful sight when we open our eyes 
 To the need of the poor 
 Oh how amazing the grace that is leading 
 The lost and the prodigals home 
 The King who carried the cross is coming again 
 He's coming to reign 
 We are called by His name to go to the world 
 And prepare the way

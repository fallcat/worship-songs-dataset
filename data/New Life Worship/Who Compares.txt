If wonder is to stand in awe 
 A moment in your presence 
 Is more than wonderful 
 If glory is like a thousand suns 
 Gazing on your shadow 
 Is more than glorious 
 How could I not be moved 
 Who compares to you 
 To all you are 
 Who compares to you 
 You stand alone 
 The highest names are only names 
 None would be exalted 
 But yours is croned in praise 
 The only king, the only God 
 Wrapped in adoration 
 Forever lifted up 
 How could I not be moved 
 Who compares to you 
 To all you are 
 Who compares to you 
 You stand alone 
 Who compares to you 
 No one no one 
 Who compares to you 
 There is no one else 
 There is no one else 
 There is none more awesome 
 Awesome than you 
 There is no one else 
 There is no one else 
 There is none more awesome 
 Awesome than you 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 How could I not be moved 
 Oh Lord 
 How could I not be moved 
 Who compares to you 
 To all you are 
 Who compares to you 
 You stand alone 
 Who compares to you 
 No one no one 
 Who compares to you 
 You stand alone

From the first break of life, to the last days 
 Every echo of time, every evenin' fade 
 You've always been there 
 From a baby's first cry, to the last breath 
 Every fight in our minds, every victory dance 
 You've always been there 
 Ancient one so amazing unfailing you are holy one overwhelming my heart with your love 
 Yahweh 
 Yawheh 
 Faithful god 
 Your here to stay 
 Yahweh 
 Yahweh 
 Forever and always the same 
 Where the sky meets the sea and breaks free 
 When compassion and love are meant with me 
 You've always been there (thank you lord) 
 Ancient one so amazing unfailing you are 
 Holy one overwhelming my heart with your love 
 Yahweh 
 Yahweh 
 Faithful god your here to stay 
 Yahweh 
 Yahweh 
 Forever and always the same 
 Yahweh 
 Yahweh 
 Faithful god your here to stay 
 Yahweh 
 Yahweh 
 And always the same

As morning dawns and evening fades 
 You inspire songs of praise 
 That rise from earth to touch Your heart and glorify Your Name 
 Your name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your name is a shelter like no other 
 Your name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save 
 But Your name 
 Jesus, in your name we pray 
 Come and fill our hearts today 
 And give us strength to live for You and glorify You name 
 Your name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your name is a shelter like no other 
 Your name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save 
 Your name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your name is a shelter like no other 
 Your name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save 
 Your name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your name is a shelter like no other 
 Your name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save 
 But Your name 
 Your name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your name is a shelter like no other 
 Your name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save 
 Your name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your name is a shelter like no other 
 Your name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save 
 But Your name 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

All I ever wanted was love 
 All I ever longed for was peace 
 All I ever needed was hope 
 Everything I've reached for was wrong 
 Temporary thrills here and gone 
 He was waiting there all along 
 He came to me 
 He's all and more 
 Than I hoped He would be 
 He's everything, everything to me 
 He calms my fears 
 And He wipes away my tears 
 He's all and more to me 
 All the love I need He provides 
 Always He will be by my side 
 I will give to Him all my life 
 Constantly He fills me with love 
 All I need and more than enough 
 Never been the same since the day 
 He came to me 
 He's all and more 
 Than I hoped He would be 
 He's everything 
 Christ is everything to me 
 He calms my fears 
 And He wipes away my tears 
 He's all and more to me 
 When you need a friend 
 (Let me tell you, He's all and more) 
 He'll give you peace within 
 (I said, that He's all and more) 
 With you till the end 
 (Jesus is all and more) 
 All and more, all and more to me! 
 He's all and more 
 Than I hoped He would be 
 He's everything 
 Christ is everything to me 
 He calms my fears 
 And He wipes away my tears 
 (All my tears) 
 He's all and more to me 
 He's all and more 
 Than I hoped He would be 
 He's everything 
 Christ is everything to me 
 He calms my fears 
 He wipes away my tears 
 He's all and more 
 All and more 
 I tell you, He's all and more to me 
 He's all and more

Picked up the mornin' paper 
 The headlines make it clear 
 This world is changin' for us all 
 I knew this day was comin' 
 Never thought it was so near 
 Looks like the writing's on the wall 
 I believe this world is trying to warn us 
 Get ready, He's coming like He said 
 All around the world 
 Can't you hear creation calling 
 Make way, soon the Savior's coming 
 All around the world 
 Creation is calling out 
 So let us not become entangled 
 By the trappings of this world 
 Let Him come and find us faithful to the call 
 All around the world 
 All around the world 
 I've got a restless feelin' 
 Growing stronger every day 
 My heart is yearning to see Him 
 (My heart is yearning) 
 Can't imagine why He's waiting 
 Everything's lined up in place 
 Everything He said would be has been 
 Whoa, and I believe this world is trying to warn us 
 Get ready, He's coming like He said 
 All around the world 
 Can't you hear creation calling 
 Make way, soon the Savior's coming 
 All around the world 
 Creation is calling out 
 So let us not become entangled 
 By the trappings of this world 
 Let Him come and find us faithful to the call 
 All around the world 
 All around the world 
 Open your eyes 
 Everywhere there are signs 
 Telling us the time is near 
 It's a truth we can't ignore 
 This old world can't take much more 
 All around the world 
 Can't you hear creation calling 
 Make way, soon the Savior's coming 
 All around the world 
 Creation is calling out 
 Oh, let us not become entangled 
 By the trappings of this world 
 Let Him come and find us faithful to the call 
 All around the world 
 All around the world

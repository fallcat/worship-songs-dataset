I was lonely, I was hurting 
 I was lost and deserted 
 I felt like hope was a million miles away 
 So I cried out for mercy 
 Jesus reach down and save me 
 Now I live to tell of His amazing grace 
 Anybody, out there searching 
 Jesus, Jesus, is all we need 
 Brokenhearted, heavy burdened 
 Jesus, Jesus, is all we need 
 He was waiting, He was listening 
 In the silence, He is whispering 
 He loves you and He longs to hold You close 
 If You let Him, He will help you 
 He will come to your rescue 
 He will love you and will never let you go 
 Anybody, out there searching, 
 Jesus, Jesus, is all we need. 
 Brokenhearted, heavy burdened, 
 Jesus, Jesus, is all we need. 
 The lost are found, the dead arise 
 Hope is here to fill your life 
 We rise up and we will live 
 We rise up and we will live 
 The lost are found, the dead arise 
 Hope is here to fill your life 
 We rise up and we will live 
 We rise up and we will live 
 Anybody, out there searching, 
 Jesus, Jesus, is all we need. 
 Brokenhearted, heavy burdened, 
 Jesus, Jesus, is all we need. 
 The lost are found, the dead arise 
 Hope is here to fill your life 
 We rise up and we will live 
 We rise up and we will live 
 The lost are found, the dead arise 
 Hope is here to fill your life 
 We rise up and we will live 
 We rise up and we will live

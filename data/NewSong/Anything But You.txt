I've got a good car that gets me where I'm going 
 I've got a good house that I can go home to 
 But all these good things this world has to offer 
 I'm just using as I'm passing through 
 There's so much about this world that can distract me 
 So Lord, I pray that I will keep my eyes on You 
 Anything but You, is only temporary 
 Anything but You will quickly fade away 
 I'm not trustin' in, dependin' on, believin' in, relying on 
 Anyone or anything but You, anything but You 
 Life has a strange way of gettin' complicated 
 All that's certain is that nothin' stays the same 
 But I'm not worried 'cause you promised You'd be with me 
 And I know that's one thing this world cannot change 
 There's so much that's tryin' to distract me 
 Lord I pray each day I keep my eyes on You 
 Anything but You, is only temporary 
 Anything but You will quickly fade away 
 I'm not trustin' in, dependin' on, believin' in, relying on 
 Anyone or anything 
 I live each day completely amazed 
 By all that I've seen You do 
 What a fool I would be if I let anything 
 Come between me and You 
 Anything but You 
 Anything but You, is only temporary 
 Anything but You will quickly fade away 
 I'm not trustin' in, dependin' on, believin' in, relying on 
 Anyone or anything but You 
 Anything but You, is only temporary 
 Anything but You will quickly fade away 
 Anything but You 
 Anyone or anything but You 
 Anything but You 
 Anything but You 
 Anything but You

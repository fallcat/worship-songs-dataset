Not a word was heard at the tomb that day 
 Just shuffling soldiers' feet as they guarded the grave 
 One day, two days, three days had past 
 Could it be that Jesus breathed His last? 
 Could it be that His Father had forsaken Him? 
 Turned His back on His son, despising our sin 
 All hell seemed to whisper, "just forget Him, He's dead" 
 Then the Father looked down to His Son and He said... 
 Arise, My love, arise, My love 
 The grave no longer has a hold on you 
 No more death's sting, no more suffering 
 Arise, arise, my love! 
 The Earth trembled and the tomb began to shake 
 And like lightening From Heaven, the stone was rolled away 
 And as dead man, the guards they all stood there in fright 
 As the power of love displayed its might 
 Then suddenly a melody filled the air 
 Riding wings of wind, it was everywhere 
 The words all creation had been longing to hear 
 The sweet sound of victory, so loud and clear 
 Arise, My love, arise, My love 
 The grave no longer has a hold on you 
 No more death's sting, no more suffering 
 Arise, arise... 
 Sin, where are your shackles? 
 Death, where is your sting? 
 Hell has been defeated 
 The grave could not hold the King 
 Arise, My love, arise, My love 
 The grave no longer has a hold on you 
 No more death's sting, no more suffering 
 Arise, arise, arise!

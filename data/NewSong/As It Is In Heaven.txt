Tonight 
 We're gathered here together 
 Desperate for your presence to come 
 Tonight 
 We're here because you love us 
 Join our hearts and make us one 
 God of glory come and fill this place 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be on earth 
 Let every heart that's present 
 Give you the praise you deserve 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be tonight 
 Right here let joy arise like an anthem 
 We lift up your banner of love 
 Oh right now let every chain be broken 
 As freedom falls like rain over us 
 God of glory come and fill this place 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be on earth 
 Let every heart that's present 
 Give you the praise you deserve 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be tonight 
 Here in this generation 
 Lord let your will be done 
 Creations crying out 
 Lord let your kingdom come 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be tonight 
 As we walk through this city 
 Let your love fill these streets 
 That we may see your beauty 
 Lord let it rain 
 As it is in heaven 
 As it is in heaven 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be on earth 
 Let every heart that's present 
 Give you the praise you deserve 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be tonight 
 Here in this generation 
 Lord let your will be done 
 Creations crying out 
 Lord let your kingdom come 
 As it is in heaven 
 Let it be tonight 
 Let it be tonight

There were no palaces or crowns, majestic robes or gowns 
 Waiting for the coming of the King 
 They were looking for a sign, hope in desperate times 
 A miracle that only God could bring 
 Many still were dreaming about the day that He would come 
 Could it be that Bethlehem held the Chosen One 
 As the world slept, one silent night 
 A Savior's born and all creation smiles 
 As the world slept, one holy night 
 And to the manger low crept Heaven's Child 
 O could it really be that Mary did conceive 
 And bear the holy One, God's only Son 
 As the world slept 
 While shepherds watched their flocks by night 
 Behold, an angel from on high 
 Proclaimed to them the Prince of Peace had come 
 A star of wonder led the way to the stable where He lay 
 The gift of love from God to everyone 
 Many still were praying for a kingdom here on earth 
 Could it be that heaven's answer was in this baby's birth?

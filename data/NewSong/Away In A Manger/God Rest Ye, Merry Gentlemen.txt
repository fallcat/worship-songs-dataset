Away in a manger, no crib for a bed 
 The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head 
 The stars in the sky looked down where he lay 
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay 
 The stars in the sky looked down where he lay 
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay 
 Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask you to stay 
 Close by me forever and love me I pray 
 Bless all the dear children in your tender care 
 And fit us for heaven, Lord, and live with me there 
 God rest ye, merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay 
 For Jesus Christ our savior was born on Christmas day 
 To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy 
 Away in a manger, no crib for a bed 
 For our comfort and joy 
 Away in manager, no crib for a bed

I hear you saying that you're life is an illusion. 
 There's something missing deep inside. 
 I think you know that there is only one solution, 
 You're Father's waiting for you with arms open wide. 
 If you just believe then you see he's all you need, 
 Don't you think it's time to come back home, 
 Back where you belong. 
 There's more to this life than only trying to survive, 
 Don't you think it's time to come back home, 
 Back where you belong. 
 Only time will tell just what your heart is saying, 
 The final answer's up to you. 
 There's no need to play the games that you've been playing, 
 You've got to give Him everything, it's all that's left to do. 
 If you just believe then you will see he's all you need, 
 Don't you think it's time to come back home, 
 Back where you belong. 
 There's more to this life than only trying to survive, 
 Don't you think it's time to come back home, 
 Back where you belong. 
 You've been trying for so long to work it out, 
 Don't you know you need to turn your life around? 
 If you just believe then you will see he's all you need, 
 Don't you think it's time to come back home, 
 Back where you belong. 
 There's more to this life than only trying to survive, 
 Don't you think it's time to come back home, 
 Back where you belong.

See the colors of the rainbow 
 He painted them by hand 
 His eye is on the sparrow 
 And every hair that's on your head 
 And did you ever think that nothing 
 Has ever slipped His mind? 
 And though He's got the whole world in His hands 
 If you call Him He's got time 
 He's the light in the dark place 
 He's the smile on a child's face 
 Hey you, don't you know 
 Good days come and good days go? 
 But He loves you 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 Tomorrow is another day and He's been there 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 Listen close, you'll hear Him whisper 
 Surprising you with joy 
 You can dream about the future 
 But His plans are so much more 
 He's the God of every wonder 
 Still He knows you by your name 
 Though He knows sometimes we stumble 
 He loves us just the same, yeah 
 He's the light in a dark place 
 He's the smile on a child's face 
 And hey you, don't you know 
 Good days come and good days go? 
 But He loves you 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 Well, it's alright, it's okay 
 Tomorrow is another day and He's been there 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 It's the beauty of our God 
 What a mystery 
 What a beautiful decree 
 What majesty 
 How everything we see says to believe 
 Hey you, don't you know 
 Good days come and good days go? 
 But He loves you 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 And it's alright, it's okay 
 Tomorrow is another day and He's been there 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 It's the beauty of our God 
 Don't you know 
 Good days come and the good days go? 
 But He loves you 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 It's alright and it's okay 
 Tomorrow is another day that He's been there 
 That's the beauty of our God 
 It's the beauty of our God 
 Hey you, don't you know 
 Good days come and good days go? 
 Hey you, don't you know 
 Good days come and good days go? 
 Hey you, don't you know 
 Good days come and good days go? 
 Hey you, don't you know 
 Good days come and good days go?

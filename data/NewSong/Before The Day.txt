Last night while I was sleeping 
 You were watching over me 
 While I dreamt about tomorrow 
 You knew my every need 
 Now another day is waiting 
 For me to make it through 
 And there is no way that I can face it without you 
 Before the Day slips away 
 I want to stop and say I love you, I love you 
 Before the world rushes in again 
 I want to stop and say 
 There is none above you 
 There is none above you 
 I just be still and know that you are God 
 Be still and know that you are God 
 There is something about the morning 
 The stillness of it all 
 That cause my heart to hear you 
 When you gently call 
 Now another day is waiting 
 For me to make it through 
 There is no way that I can faces it without you 
 Here I am in your presence 
 Where I long to be 
 Alone with you in the silence 
 Rain down your love and your mercy 
 Whisper softly to me 
 Before the Day slips away 
 I want to stop and say I love you, I love you 
 Before the Day slips away 
 I want to stop and say I love you, I love you 
 Before the Day slips away 
 I want to stop and say I love you, I love you 
 Before the world rushes in again 
 I want to stop and say 
 There is none above you 
 There is none above you 
 I just be still and know that you are God 
 Be still and know that you are God

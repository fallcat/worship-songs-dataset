Every shepherd has a sheep 
 That he calls the bellwether 
 And everywhere the shepherd goes 
 He's with him 
 The bellwether soon understands 
 The heart of the shepherd 
 And the bond between them grows every day 
 In every way 
 And the bellwether walks with the lost sheep 
 Spends his time with those who have roamed 
 And when he returns to the shepherd 
 One by one, they follow him home 
 God's only son left His throne 
 To become our bellwether 
 His life He gave to seek and save 
 The lost sheep 
 The perfect lamb who knew no sin 
 Said "here am I, send me" 
 I'll lead the way so those who strayed 
 Can follow 
 Follow me home 
 And the bellwether walks with the lost sheep 
 Spends his time with those who have roamed 
 And when he returns to the shepherd 
 One by one, they follow him home 
 Now He waits for me and you 
 To take them the good news 
 There is a path that leads them home to safety 
 They're hurting and they're scared 
 Scattered everywhere 
 They need to know with open arms, He's waiting 
 And the bellwether walks with the lost sheep 
 Spends his time with those who have roamed 
 And when he returns to the shepherd 
 One by one, they follow him home 
 And the bellwether walks with the lost sheep 
 Spends his time with those who have roamed 
 And when he returns to the shepherd 
 One by one, they follow him home 
 Follow him home 
 Follow him home

Not one of us will get through life unscarred 
 If no wounds upon our body, then our hearts 
 Lord you work all things by Your plan 
 And nothing comes without passing through Your hand 
 And You are sovereign over all that's been broken by the fall 
 So give us strength, Lord, here and now 
 In the days between The Cross and Crown 
 We long for hope for when this world's restored 
 When every knee will bow to You, and call You "Lord" 
 But till then, Your Spirit's here to guide 
 Our Comforter, Counselor, The Breath of Life 
 In the days between The Cross and Crown 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Give us strength, Lord, here and now 
 In the days between The Cross and Crown 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Lord, give us strength, oh here and now 
 In the days between The Cross and Crown 
 In the days between The Cross and Crown 
 In the days between The Cross and Crown

 He said goodbye to the angels of heaven 
 And He came to earth as a common man 
 He taught us how we could love one another 
 There was healing in His hands 
 There were those who believed and followed Him 
 And there were those who wanted Him dead 
 They thought the grave would silence Him forever 
 But they found out instead 
 You can close your eyes 
 You can say it's a lie 
 You can stick your head in the sand 
 You can turn away, even try to explain 
 He was just another man 
 When they nailed Him to the cross by His hands and feet 
 And they put Him in the ground 
 Three days later everybody found out that you can't 
 No you can't keep a good man down, no 
 No you can't keep a good man down 
 I hear you say that it all sounds crazy 
 It's a good story but it can't be true 
 How could a man who was dead and buried 
 Mean a thing to me and you 
 Here we are two thousand years later 
 And still the choice is just the same 
 You can say that you don't believe it 
 But it doesn't change a thing 
 You can close your eyes 
 You can say it's a lie 
 You can stick your head in the sand 
 You can turn away, even try to explain 
 He was just another man 
 When they nailed Him to the cross by His hands and feet 
 And they put Him in the ground 
 Three days later everybody found out that you can't 
 No you can't keep a good man down, no 
 No you can't keep a good man down 
 I can take you to the hill where they hung Him on the cross 
 I can take you to the empty tomb 
 I can tell you He's alive 'cause He lives in me 
 But the rest is up to you 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 You can close your eyes 
 You can say it's a lie 
 You can stick your head in the sand 
 You can turn away, even try to explain 
 He was just another man 
 When they nailed Him to the cross by His hands and feet 
 And they put Him in the ground 
 Three days later everybody found out that you can't 
 No you can't keep a good man down, no 
 No you can't keep a good man down 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Long before I was ever formed in my mother's womb 
 You knew and loved me 
 Then You came and You rescued me showed me the truth 
 Of what my life could be 
 Now when I try to explain all the joy all the love I'm feeling' 
 Feeling in my heart 
 I start thinking about who You are 
 Words like cherish come to mind 
 Every time that I'm reminded how You set me free 
 And just how much You love me 
 Words like mercy and grace 
 Bring a smile to my face 
 I know that there is nothing that could ever keep us apart 
 Because I know I hold 
 A special place in Your heart 
 There were days I was so amazed that I made it through 
 But You were right there beside me 
 And there were nights when I closed my eyes and I called out to You 
 And Lord You helped me to believe 
 And when I try to explain all the joy all the love I'm feeling 
 Feeling in my heart 
 I start thinking about who You are 
 I'll spend my life 
 I'll keep telling the story 
 To everyone who would believe 
 How God would come down 
 From all of His glory 
 Out of love for someone like me

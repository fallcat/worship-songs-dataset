Here on the battle line 
 You're on your side, I'm on mine 
 We've built a wall so high, one brick at a time 
 Was it pride or was it fear? 
 The reason still unclear 
 But here we are, a world apart 
 What if we stood with hearts wide open 
 Ready to start again 
 What if we let God's grace take over 
 Learn to forgive and forget 
 What if we choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 What if we choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 A little time, a little faith 
 A little mercy for mistakes 
 Maybe love is all it takes to heal these scars 
 When we lay our weapons down 
 All the walls fall to the ground 
 We were worlds apart, and now here we are 
 What if we stood with hearts wide open 
 Ready to start again 
 What if we let God's grace take over 
 Learn to forgive and forget 
 What if we choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 What if we choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Can stop us now 
 Can stop us now 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Can stop us now 
 Can stop us now 
 What if we stood with hearts wide open 
 Ready to start again 
 What if we let God's grace take over 
 And learn to forgive and forget 
 What if we stood with hearts wide open 
 Ready to start again 
 What if we let God's grace take over 
 Learn to forgive and forget 
 What if we choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 What if we choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love 
 We choose to love

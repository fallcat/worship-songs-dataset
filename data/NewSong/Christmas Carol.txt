I first met her in December on a snowy winter's night 
 And it didn't take me long to see that something wasn't right 
 They called her Christmas Carol 
 Said her mind was nearly gone 
 But she could still light up the room 
 When she sang a Christmas song 
 Seems no one knows the story to explain her Christmas cheer 
 Why she keeps the decorations up all through the year 
 And though she long ago forgot the names of family and friends 
 When it comes to singing Christmas songs 
 She's like a child again 
 Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol 
 Sing with all of your might 
 Sing Joy to the World 
 Sing O Holy Night 
 You're closer now to Jesus 
 Than you've ever been 
 Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol 
 Sing your songs to him 
 I had told my son about her, so I thought I'd take him by 
 And he was so amazed at all the tinsel and the lights 
 She laughed and told her stories of her Christmas memories 
 But nothing told it better than when she began to sing 
 Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol 
 Sing with all of your might 
 Sing Joy to the World 
 Sing O Holy Night 
 The last time that I saw her, she didn't recognize me 
 Her hair was thin and she was frail, and she couldn't even speak 
 But I could sit down next to her, sing her favorite Christmas songs 
 And somehow, God only knows how 
 She could still sing right along 
 Sing, oh sing, Christmas Carol 
 Sing with all of your might 
 Sing Joy to the World 
 Sing O Holy Night

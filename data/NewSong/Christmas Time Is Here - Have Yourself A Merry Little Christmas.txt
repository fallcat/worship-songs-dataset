Christmas time is here 
 Happiness and cheer 
 Fun for all 
 That children call their favorite time of year 
 Snowflakes in the air 
 Carols everywhere 
 Oh, that we could always see 
 Such spirit through the year 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Let your heart be light 
 From now on our troubles will be out of sight 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Make the Yuletide gay 
 From now on our troubles will be miles away 
 Here we are as in olden days 
 Happy golden days of yore 
 Faithful friends who are dear to us 
 Gather near to us once more 
 Through the years we all will be together 
 If the Lord allows 
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough 
 And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

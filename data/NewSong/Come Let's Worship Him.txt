 The Mighty One 
 Come, let's worship Him 
 O, give thanks to the Lord 
 Great things He has done

 And lift our hands in praise 
 With joyful adoration 
 Our voices we will raise 
 And come before His presence 
 All in one accord

 Hear the sweet surrender 
 Of hearts touched by His care 
 Holy is His presence 
 Awesome is His name 
 Jesus, our Redeemer 
 Forever He shall reign

 Celebrate Christ the King 
 The Mighty One

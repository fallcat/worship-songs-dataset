There comes a time in every heart 
 A time of real decision 
 When we reach the point of choosing 
 How we will live our lives 
 All our hopes, all our dreams 
 Will rise up from that moment 
 The moment we surrender 
 And choose to fallow Christ 
 He's been waiting all our lives to hear us say 
 "I am Yours, Lord, take my hand and lead the way" 
 When you believe He's all you need 
 That will be your defining moment 
 As you live your life walking in His light 
 Trusting Him completely 
 That will be, that will be your defining moment 
 All I have, all I am is resting in His promise 
 The promise that He'll make me everything that I should be 
 I will live, I will die, for the cause He set before me 
 To take this love in side my heart for all the world to see 
 Oh, all of heaven celebrates when they hear someone say 
 "I am Yours, Lord, take my hand and lead the way" 
 When you believe He's all you need 
 That will be your defining moment 
 As you live your life walking in His light 
 Trusting Him completely 
 That will be, that will be your defining moment, yeah 
 His amazing grace is such a mystery, yeah 
 How in an instant it can make your life complete 
 When you believe He's all you need 
 That will be your defining moment 
 As you live your life walking in His light 
 Trusting Him completely 
 When you believe He's all you need 
 That will be your defining moment 
 As you live your life walking in His light 
 Trusting Him completely 
 That will be, that will be your defining moment, oh, oh 
 Your defining moment, oh 
 Your defining moment

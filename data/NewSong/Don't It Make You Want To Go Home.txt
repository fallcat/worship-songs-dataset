The morning paper is reading like a scroll 
 Like the headlines from 2000 years ago 
 Everywhere I look I see the signs 
 My hearts telling me it's almost time 
 Don't it make you want to go home 
 Run through those gates and fall in Jesus' arms 
 And all the cares of this world will be gone 
 Don't it make ya Don't it make you wanna go home 
 I can't wait to sit at Jesus feet 
 To hear him say welcome home to me 
 I can almost feel his warm embrace 
 And His nail scarred hands as they wipe my tears away 
 Don't it make you want to go home 
 Run through those gates and fall in Jesus' arms 
 And all the cares of this world will be gone 
 Don't it make ya Don't it make you wanna go home 
 Far away from this world of pain 
 God's prepared a perfect place 
 And I can't stop thinking about it 
 I'm so homesick for it 
 Don't it make you want don't it make you wanna go home 
 Don't it make you want to go home 
 Run through those gates and fall in Jesus' arms 
 And all the cares of this world will be gone 
 Don't it make ya Don't it make you wanna go home 
 Don't it make you want to go home 
 Run through those gates and straight to heaven's throne 
 And fall in Jesus' arms 
 Don't it make ya Don't it make you wanna go home 
 Yeah, yes I wanna go home 
 Yeah, yes I wanna go home 
 Yeah, yes I wanna go home

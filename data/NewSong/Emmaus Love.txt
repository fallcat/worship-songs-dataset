Their hearts burned within them as they walked 
 And as they talked about 
 All the things they had seen 
 So many questions on their mind 
 But their eyes were blind 
 To what His death would mean 
 Who is this Man who walks with them 
 And explains the mysteries 
 Could it be that He's the risen One 
 Come to set them free 
 My Emmaus Love everyday He walks with me 
 Emmaus love everyday He talks with me 
 Emmaus love He's always there for me 
 My Emmaus love 
 He's the light that helps me find my way 
 Every step I take 
 He knows my every need 
 I hear His voice speaking to my heart 
 The very deepest part 
 Saying follow where I lead 
 Who is this Man who walks with me 
 And explains the mysteries 
 I know that He's the risen One 
 Come to set me free 
 So many roads and choices to make 
 So many answers to find 
 I can't imagine living one day 
 Without You in my life

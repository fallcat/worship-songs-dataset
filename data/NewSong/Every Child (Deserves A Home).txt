To be remembered on your birthday 
 Feel a father's kiss goodnight 
 To have a mother wrap her arms around you 
 And say it's gonna be alright 
 These are the things we take for granted 
 That every child should know and love 
 It's simply heaven's way of telling them 
 They are precious in this world 
 Precious in this world 
 Every child deserves a home 
 Every child deserves to hear the words, "You are not alone." 
 Every life on earth is sacred 
 Every heart is heaven's own 
 Every child deserves a home 
 Deserves a home 
 They are out there by the millions 
 Hurting children without hope 
 Little boys and girls who need a family 
 That they can call their own 
 Now it's up to us to help them 
 We can't just close our eyes 
 Jesus loves the little children 
 And His arms are open wide 
 They are open wide 
 Every child deserves a home 
 Every child deserves to hear the words, "You are not alone." 
 Every life on earth is sacred 
 Every heart is heaven's own 
 Every child deserves a home 
 There's something in their faces that tells us their story 
 There's something in their cry that keeps calling out, "Don't forget about me." 
 Red and yellow, black and white 
 They are precious in His sight 
 Jesus died for all the children of the world 
 Every child deserves a home 
 Every child deserves to hear the words, "You are not alone." 
 Every life on earth is sacred

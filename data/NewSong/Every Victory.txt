My heart shall not be moved 
 My faith not overwhelmed 
 Troubles they will come 
 But even in the storm 
 My eyes are fixed on you 
 My soul is resolute 
 Troubles may arise 
 But even in the trials 
 On this I stand 
 On this alone 
 All my hope 
 All my strength 
 And all my confidence 
 Is in knowing I've received 
 Every Victory 
 Through the cross 
 Through the blood 
 It is finished it is done 
 I am saved 
 I am free 
 You are Every Victory 
 The grave is overcome 
 My shame has been redeemed 
 Sin is washed away 
 Mercy took its place 
 On this I stand 
 On this alone 
 All my hope 
 All my strength 
 And all my confidence 
 Is in knowing I've received 
 Every Victory 
 Through the cross 
 Through the blood 
 It is finished it is done 
 I am saved 
 I am free 
 You are Every Victory 
 Oh, You have Won 
 You have won 
 And the enemy 
 Is forevermore underneath Your feet 
 You have Won 
 You have won 
 And the enemy 
 Is forevermore underneath Your feet 
 Yes, he's underneath Your feet 
 All my hope 
 All my strength 
 And all my confidence 
 Is in knowing I've received 
 Every Victory 
 All my hope 
 All my strength 
 And all my confidence 
 Is in knowing I've received 
 Every Victory 
 Through the cross 
 Through the blood 
 It is finished it is done 
 I am saved 
 I am free 
 You are Every Victory 
 Every Victory 
 Every Victory 
 I'm not afraid

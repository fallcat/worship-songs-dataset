We face evil foes who deliver their threats 
 Bombarding our lives with words of fear and death 
 Satanic attackers, destroyers of men 
 Engaged in a war that they never can win, oh... 
 Let's not be tempted to use earthly power 
 It will only be used against us 
 We can bring evil down, for we hold higher ground 
 When we trust in the one who defends us 
 Let the Father of Love 
 Be our strength from above 
 We are strong when we yield to His way 
 When we walk in the light 
 We can battle the night 
 Trust His power to protect us each day 
 Lay our weapons down 
 Our victory is found in the Lord 
 None can destroy love 
 It lasts forever 
 We are the soldiers 
 The soldiers of the Father of Love 
 The soldiers of the Father of Love 
 The ruler of darkness in this world is strong 
 But no match for the Christian with God's armor on 
 Ready for combat, His word in our hearts 
 Able to stand against all fiery darts, oh... 
 Be wise as a serpent when you face our foe 
 It's not flesh and blood we are fighting 
 We are destined to win this war that we're in 
 So be bold, in Him we are mighty 
 Let the Father of Love 
 Be our strength from above 
 We are strong when we yield to His way 
 When we walk in the light 
 We can battle the night 
 Trust His power to protect us each day 
 Lay our weapons down 
 Our victory is found in the Lord 
 None can destroy love 
 It lasts forever 
 We are the soldiers 
 The soldiers of the Father of Love 
 The soldiers of the Father of Love 
 Father of Love 
 Father of Love

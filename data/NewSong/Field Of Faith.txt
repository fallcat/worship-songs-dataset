Up each mornin' at the crack of dawn 
 I gotta get goin' before the day gets gone 
 I'm a man who believes in a faith that works 
 I don't mind a little sweat 
 And I don't mind a little dirt 
 'Cause there's a great big world out there 
 With a great big need 
 So I'm diggin' in my heels 
 And I'm rollin' up my sleeves 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Out here spreadin' God's amazing grace 
 Doin' the work of the Father, whatever it takes 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Someone must sow where no one else has been 
 Someone must water thirsty hearts of men 
 Together we'll labor till the harvest comes 
 Working side by side till the job gets done 
 'Cause there's a great big world out there 
 With a great big need 
 So I'm diggin' in my heels 
 And I'm rollin' up my sleeves 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Out here spreadin' God's amazing grace 
 Doin' the work of the Father, whatever it takes 
 Out here workin' in the field... 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Out here spreadin' God's amazing grace 
 Doin' the work of the Father, whatever it takes 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Out here spreadin' God's amazing grace 
 Doin' the work of the Father, whatever it takes 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Out here spreadin' God's amazing grace 
 Doin' the work of the Father, whatever it takes 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Work, work, work 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Work, work, work 
 Work, work, work 
 Out here workin' in the field of faith 
 Work, work, work 
 Work, work, work...

Only so much that a man can take 
 Be pushed so far before He finally breaks 
 I've turned my head, I've closed my eyes 
 But you keep coming on with your lies 
 I know my rights and I'm drawing the line 
 I know I can't lose with the Lord on my side 
 I'm gonna fight back 
 Gonna stand my ground 
 I'm tired of being pushed around 
 I'm gonna get tough 
 'Cause I've had enough 
 Starting here and now 
 I'm gonna fight back 
 We're in a war, battle lines are drawn 
 Satan knows where we're weak and we're strong 
 I've felt the pain and I've got my scars 
 I've dropped my guard and I've been hit hard 
 There comes a time when enough is enough 
 In the strength of the Lord, and it's time to stand up 
 I'm gonna fight back 
 Gonna stand my ground 
 You know I'm tired 
 Of being pushed around 
 I'm gonna get tough 
 'Cause I've had enough 
 Starting here and now 
 I'm gonna fight back 
 Not by our power or by our might will we stand 
 But by Your spirit, Lord, in us 
 By the strength of Your hand 
 I'm gonna fight back 
 Gonna stand my ground 
 I'm so tired of being pushed around 
 I'm gonna get tough 
 'Cause I've had enough 
 Starting here, starting now 
 I'm gonna fight back 
 I'm gonna fight back 
 Gonna stand my ground 
 I'm tired I'm tired 
 Of being pushed around 
 I'm gonna get tough 
 'Cause enough's enough 
 Starting here, starting now 
 I'm gonna fight back! 
 (Fight back!) 
 Fight back 
 You got to stand up 
 Stand up! 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I'm gonna fight back!

Up in the hills somewhere in Kentucky 
 Is a little old school way back in the nothing 
 Where special kids born with special needs 
 Are sent to learn life's ABCs 
 Their teacher, Mrs. Jones, tells them all about Jesus 
 How in the twinkling of an eye He's coming back to get us 
 About streets of gold and pearly gates 
 How they want to go, they just can't wait 
 And she can't keep them in their seats 
 They're all at the windows straining to see 
 And it's fingertips and noses 
 Pressed to the windowpanes 
 Longing eyes, expectant hearts 
 For Him to come again 
 All they know is that they love Him so 
 And if He said He'd come, He's coming 
 And they can't keep their windows clean 
 For fingertips and noses 
 Well, she tried to explain to the kids about His coming 
 Ooh, she tried to calm them down, but they just wouldn't listen 
 They just giggled and they clapped their hands 
 They're so excited that He's coming for them 
 And the first thing you know they're out of their seats 
 Back at the windows straining to see 
 And it's fingertips and noses 
 Pressed to the windowpanes 
 Longing eyes, expectant hearts 
 For Him to come again 
 All they know is that they love Him so 
 And if He said He'd come, He's coming 
 And they can't keep their windows clean 
 For fingertips and noses 
 Where will Jesus find us 
 When He comes again? 
 Will we be like little children 
 Waiting just for Him? 
 With our fingertips and noses 
 Pressed to the windowpanes 
 Longing eyes, expectant hearts 
 For Him to come again 
 All we know is that we love Him so 
 And if He said He'd come, He's coming 
 And we can't keep our windows clean 
 For our fingertips and noses 
 Fingertips and noses 
 Ooh, she tried to explain to the kids about His coming 
 Our fingertips and noses 
 Fingertips and noses 
 In the twinkling of an eye He's coming back to get us

Well it's a great, great mornin' 
 Your first day in Heaven 
 When you stroll down the Golden Avenue 
 There are mansions left and right 
 And you're thrilled every sight 
 And the saints are always smiling sayin' 
 "How do you do?" 
 Oh it's a great, great mornin' 
 Your first day in Heaven 
 When you realize your worryin' day are through 
 You'll be glad you were not idol 
 Took time to read your Bible 
 It's a great, great mornin' for you 
 I had a dream and I'll confess, I hated to awake 
 He dreamt he was an angel at the great pearly gates 
 Saint Peter said, "Well hello there, where have you been? 
 We've got your mansion ready so come right in." 
 And then he rang for an angel to act as a guide 
 He spread his wings a time or two and learned how to fly 
 Well it's a great, great mornin' 
 Your first day in Heaven 
 When you stroll down the Golden Avenue 
 There are mansions left and right 
 And you're thrilled every sight 
 And the saints are always smiling sayin' 
 "How do you do?" 
 It's a great, great mornin' 
 Your first day in Heaven 
 When you realize your worryin' day are through 
 You'll be glad you were not idol 
 Took time to read your Bible 
 It's a great mornin' 
 A great mornin' 
 What a happy day

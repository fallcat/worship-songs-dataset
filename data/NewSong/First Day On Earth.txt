It's your first day on earth 
 A long awaited surprise 
 We all agree you're beautiful 
 And that you've got your mother's eyes 
 And there's so much to tell you 
 I don't know where to start 
 You're so innocent and perfect 
 But this world we live in is not 
 But don't you worry about a thing now, child 
 God is watchin' over us 
 So close your eyes and go to sleep 
 It's your first day on earth 
 It's your first day on earth 
 I bet you're wonderin' who I am 
 It feels like God Himself brought you to us 
 I'm holdin' heaven in my hands 
 And there's so much to tell you 
 I don't know where to start 
 You're so innocent and perfect 
 But this world we live in is not 
 But don't you worry about a thing now, child 
 God is watchin' over us 
 So close your eyes and go to sleep 
 It's your first day on earth 
 Close your eyes and go to sleep 
 It's your first day on earth 
 I'd build a castle for you 
 To protect you from all harm 
 If I thought that it would keep you safe 
 You'd never leave my arms 
 But I know that there's a life for you 
 That'll take you far from me 
 And the love of God will keep you 
 So don't you worry 'bout a thing 
 It's your first day on earth 
 Gonna start prayin' today 
 That God'll send His perfect one 
 To steal your heart away 
 'Cause I know that day is comin' 
 When you'll kiss us all goodbye 
 You'll pack up all your favorite things 
 And start a brand a new life 
 I know it's silly to say I'm a little sad today 
 You won't always be with us 
 But that's a million years from now 
 And it's your first day on earth 
 But that's a million years from now 
 And it's your first day on earth 
 It's your first day on earth

When I was down to my last prayer 
 You were there to love me 
 Just when I thought nobody cared 
 You were thinking of me 
 I went down for my last time 
 You came to my rescue 
 Now after all You've done for me 
 I'm totally committed to live for You 
 And for goodness sake, I'll take up my cross 
 And follow You, whatever the cost 
 I'll trust in You with every step I take 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 Two thousand years have come and gone 
 But still the battle's raging 
 The tug of war between the right and wrong 
 That every day we're facing 
 So I want to spend my life 
 Helping others see the truth 
 'Cause after all You've done for me 
 I'm totally committed to live for You 
 And for goodness sake, I'll take up my cross 
 And follow You, whatever the cost 
 I trust in You with every step I take 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 And for goodness sake, I'll take up my cross 
 And follow You, whatever the cost 
 I'll trust in You with every step I take 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 You saw my sin, You took the blame 
 Because of me, You suffered shame 
 For all the pain that I put You through, Lord 
 Giving You my life is the least I can do 
 For goodness sake, I'll take up my cross 
 And follow You, whatever the cost 
 I'll trust in You with every step I take 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 For goodness sake, I'll take up my cross 
 And follow You, whatever the cost 
 I'll trust in You with every step I take 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 For goodness sake, I'll take up my cross 
 Follow You, whatever the cost 
 (I'm gonna trust You, Lord) 
 Trust in You with every step I take 
 (I'm gonna follow You, oh...) 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 For goodness sake, I'll take up my cross 
 Follow You, whatever the cost 
 (Oh-oh-oh, yeah, for goodness sake) 
 Trust in You with every step I take 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh...) 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 I'm gonna live for You, for goodness sake 
 I'm gonna follow You, Lord, for goodness sake

To live is Christ 
 I have a passion in my heart I've never known before 
 That makes me love Him more 
 To die is gain 
 I am learning through surrender what it really means 
 To know that I am free 
 And it's my prayer 
 I would live each day in such a way 
 That in all I do I would bring Him praise 
 For the glory of Christ 
 I'll lay down everything that I've been given 
 All my hopes and my ambitions 
 For what He wants for me 
 For the glory of Christ 
 I'll take up my cross and follow 
 Wherever He may lead I'll live my life 
 For the glory of Christ 
 He knows my heart 
 He knows I seldom measure up to what I long to be 
 And what He has for me 
 I know His grace 
 And I have seen how far His arms will reach to rescue me 
 From the man that I could be 
 And it's my prayer 
 I would live each day in such a way 
 That in all I do I would bring Him praise 
 And when I think of what my life was worth 
 And how He gave His life to bring salvation to this world 
 How could I ever offer less than He deserves

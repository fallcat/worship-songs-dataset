Before the kingdom, You were King 
 And when there was nothing 
 You were everything 
 Before foundation stood 
 Before evil, before good 
 You were forever 
 Before the night, before the day 
 Before the man was formed from clay 
 Before life, before death 
 Before the first breath 
 You were forever 
 Forever King 
 You're everything 
 My heart has need to know 
 My first, my last 
 My future, my past 
 The strength of all my hopes 
 You're the Rock of all the ages 
 Eternal timeless Savior 
 Forever King, You're everything 
 Forever 
 After the stars desert the sky 
 And after the rivers all run dry 
 When the earth is no more 
 And the heavens roar 
 You'll be forever 
 Then we'll gather 'round Your throne 
 Of every nation all Your own 
 And in one accord 
 Oh, we'll praise You, Lord 
 You are forever 
 Forever King 
 You're everything 
 My heart has need to know 
 My first, my last 
 My future, my past 
 The strength of all my hopes 
 You're the Rock of all the ages 
 Eternal timeless Savior 
 Forever King, You're everything 
 Forever 
 You're the Rock of all the ages 
 Eternal timeless Savior 
 Forever King, You're everything 
 Forever King!

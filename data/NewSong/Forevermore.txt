You breathed the word of life to men 
 And flowing through each pen 
 It became the written word 
 Each line, the character of You 
 Spelling out just who You are 
 Then You anointed it with power 
 To go and never fail 
 The living word giving faith when heard 
 Forever will prevail 
 Forevermore 
 (And ever and evermore) 
 Lord, Your word will stand forevermore 
 (And ever and evermore) 
 For generation to generation 
 Never changing but causing change 
 Lord, Your word will stand forevermore 
 God's love written in these lines 
 Not bound by space and time 
 It remains the Holy Word 
 Divine the plan for you and me 
 Forever it shall be alive 
 Eternal words of promise 
 Giving hope to man 
 Though heaven and earth shall pass away 
 Forever it will stand 
 Forevermore 
 (And ever and evermore) 
 Lord, Your word will stand forevermore 
 (And ever and evermore) 
 For generation to generation 
 Never changing but causing change 
 Lord, Your word will stand forevermore 
 (And ever and evermore) 
 Lord, Your word will stand forevermore 
 (And ever and evermore) 
 For generation to generation 
 Never changing but causing change 
 Lord, Your word will stand forevermore 
 Forevermore! 
 Forevermore! 
 Lord, Your word will stand forevermore

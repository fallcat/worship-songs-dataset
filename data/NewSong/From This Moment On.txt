Today you're giving your all 
 You've never trusted like this before 
 You heard Him knocking at your heart's door 
 He whispered your name and you answered the call 
 Now tears of joy fall like rain 
 They seem to wash away every fear 
 You feel God's presence so very near 
 Somehow you know that you're not the same 
 And a brand new life is waiting for you 
 Starting here, starting now 
 From this moment on 
 From here to forever 
 He will carry you 
 Safe inside His love 
 He has promised you 
 He'll never forsake you 
 You'll never be alone 
 From this moment on 
 From this moment on 
 Tomorrow questions may come 
 Those same old questions, those same old doubts 
 Don't let uncertainty pull you down 
 God will complete what He has begun 
 There's a brand new life waitiing for you 
 Starting here, starting now 
 From this moment on 
 From here to forever 
 He will carry you 
 Safe inside His love 
 He has promised you 
 He'll never forsake you 
 You'll never be alone 
 From this moment on 
 Oh, from this moment on 
 From here to forever 
 He will be your strength 
 When life's troubles come 
 Oh, He will be your joy 
 In times of sorrow 
 You'll never be alone 
 From this moment on 
 This world may pass away 
 But that won't separate you 
 From His love 
 From this moment on 
 From here to forever 
 He will carry you 
 Safe inside His love 
 He has promised you 
 He'll never forsake you 
 You'll never be alone 
 From this moment on 
 From this moment on 
 From here to forever 
 He will be your strength 
 When life's troubles come 
 He will be your joy 
 In times of sorrow 
 You'll never be alone 
 From this moment on 
 From this moment on

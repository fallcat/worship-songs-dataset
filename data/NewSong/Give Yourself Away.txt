When you find someone in trouble 
 And you don't know what to say 
 The best thing you can do for them 
 Is to give yourself away 
 Lend a hand to lift the broken 
 Let your heart break when God's heart breaks 
 Speak up for those who have no voice 
 And give yourself away 
 Give yourself away, be the hands and feet of Jesus 
 Give yourself away, go out and make a world of difference 
 Let this be the day you see how far that His love reaches 
 The greatest sacrifice of all is to give yourself away 
 Yes, it is 
 Jesus saw us in our suffering, He saw the debt that sin had made 
 And on that cruel and fateful cross He gave himself away 
 Jesus knew what love would cost Him, a price that only He could pay 
 And though they ridiculed and spat on Him, He gave Himself away 
 Give yourself away, be the hands and feet of Jesus 
 Give yourself away, go out and make a world of difference 
 Let this be the day you see how far that His love reaches 
 The greatest sacrifice of all is to give yourself away 
 The greatest sacrifice of all is to give yourself away 
 So don't hold back, don't hold on for someone else to come along 
 The time is now, it's up to us to go out and prove His love 
 There's a hurting world that's dying for someone to come and love them 
 The only way to truly live is to give yourself away 
 Give yourself away, be the hands and feet of Jesus 
 Give yourself away, go out and make a world of difference 
 Let this be the day you see how far that His love reaches 
 The greatest sacrifice of all is to give yourself away 
 Give yourself away, be the hands and feet of Jesus 
 Give yourself away, go out and make a world of difference 
 Let this be the day you see how far that His love reaches 
 The greatest sacrifice of all is to give yourself away 
 The greatest sacrifice of all is to give yourself away 
 Give yourself away, give yourself away 
 Go out and make a world of difference 
 Give yourself away, give yourself away

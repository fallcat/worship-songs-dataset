I know you wished that you had been there to say goodbye 
 I know you wished that you could turn back the hands of time 
 I know the pain of loss you're feelin' is almost more than you can bear 
 But let me give you hope in despair 
 All you need is God and time 
 To heal your broken heart 
 God and time 
 To lift you up from where you are 
 I don't have all the answers to all your questions why 
 All I know is all you really need is God and time 
 Only God can truly understand how His healing works 
 And how he uses time in our lives to overcome our hurts 
 But one thing you can be sure of He is not surprised 
 By anything that happens in your life 
 All you need is God and time 
 To heal your broken heart 
 God and time 
 To lift you up from where you are 
 I don't have all the answers to all your questions why 
 All I know is all you really need is God and time 
 I know this side of heaven we may never understand 
 But we can trust the heart of God 
 And know we're always in His hands 
 All you need is God and time 
 To heal your broken heart 
 God and time 
 To lift you up from where you are 
 I don't have all the answers to all your questions why 
 All I know is all you really need is God and time

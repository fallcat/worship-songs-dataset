Well, you hoped this day would never come 
 You can't look back, what's done is done 
 It's just so hard to lose and then go on 
 When all you have is not enough 
 It's hard to fall and get back up 
 When you can't breathe and your heart has lost its song 
 But there is hope, my friend 
 You will sing again 
 'Cause God hears when there are no words to speak 
 God hears when your sorrow runs deep 
 And it feels like all your faith has disappeared 
 God hears, God hears 
 In a place they call Gethsemane 
 That's where He found His victory 
 When He told His Father, "Not my will but Yours" 
 Jesus gave His life to rescue us 
 And He knew that it would be enough 
 To conquer death and open heaven's doors 
 Oh, and a love so deep 
 It leads us to believe 
 That God hears when there are no words to speak 
 God hears when your sorrow runs deep 
 And it feels like all your faith has disappeared 
 Well, God hears 
 God's still God even when He's quiet 
 And all your questions come 
 When all you thought you had is gone 
 When you feel lost somewhere in the silence 
 And fear comes rushing in 
 Don't give up, you're not alone, no 
 'Cause God is here, yeah, and there are no words to speak 
 God is here, yeah, and His healing runs deep 
 And all those questions that you have just disappear 
 'Cause God hears, yeah 
 God hears, yeah 
 And when it feels like all your faith has disappeared 
 Let the presence of His love [Incomprehensible] 
 'Cause God hears, yeah 
 God is here, yeah 
 'Cause God hears, yeah 
 Yes, He does 
 God hears, yeah

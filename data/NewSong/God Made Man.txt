All my life I've heard it said 
 You've got to make your own way 
 If you want to get ahead 
 There's a price you will pay 
 I listened good and I tried real hard 
 But it didn't get me far 
 I found out He's holdin' me in the palm of His hand 
 I got no doubt He's callin' me to be a God made man 
 Gonna trust in Him completely 
 Gonna go wherever He leads me 
 Givin' everything to be a God made man 
 Gonna love Him with my whole heart 
 Follow Him no matter how far 
 Won't be content 'til I am a God made man 
 Everyday I remind myself 
 I'm just a work in progress 
 How much I need His help 
 To take every step I take 
 Every time that I lose my way 
 My heart goes back to that day 
 I found out He's holdin' me in the palm of His hand 
 I got no doubt He's callin' me to be a God made man 
 Gonna trust in Him completely 
 Gonna go wherever He leads me 
 Givin' everything to be a God made man 
 Gonna love Him with my whole heart 
 Follow Him no matter how far 
 Won't be content 'til I am a God made man 
 I know He's shapin' me into the man 
 That He wants me to be 
 Gonna trust in Him completely 
 Gonna go wherever He leads me 
 Givin' everything to be a God made man 
 Gonna love Him with my whole heart 
 Follow Him no matter how far 
 Won't be content 'til I am a God made man

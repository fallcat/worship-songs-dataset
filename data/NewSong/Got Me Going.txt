I've had my share of life's complications 
 But You were always there to pull me through 
 You took me in with all my imperfections 
 Lovin' my brother is the least that I could do 
 Anywhere there's a heart that's achin' 
 Anywhere there's a life undone 
 Anywhere there's a dream that's breakin' 
 That is where I'm bound to run 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 Telling people 
 Your love's get me goin' around the world 
 Every boy and every girl, everybody in the world 
 Needs to know just how much You love them 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 (Round and round and round and round the world) 
 I walk the streets and everywhere I'm hearin' 
 "Does anybody really care about me?" 
 So many people with an empty feeling 
 So many people crying out to be free 
 Anywhere there's a heart that's achin' 
 Anywhere there's a life undone 
 Anywhere there's a dream that's breakin' 
 That is where I'm bound to run 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 Telling people 
 Your love's get me goin' around the world 
 Every boy and every girl, everybody in the world 
 Needs to know just how much You love them 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 Undying love is in such great demand 
 I gotta go because my heart commands 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 I'm telling people 
 Your love's get me goin' around the world 
 Every boy and every girl, everybody in the world 
 Needs to know just how much You love them 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 I'm telling people 
 Your love's get me goin' around the world 
 Every boy and every girl, everybody in the world 
 Needs to know just how much You love them 
 Your love's got me goin' around the world 
 (Round and round and round and round the world) 
 Ooh, round and round and round and round the world 
 (Round and round and round and round the world)

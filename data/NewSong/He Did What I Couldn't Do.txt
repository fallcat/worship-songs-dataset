God looked out from Heaven and saw the pain that I was in. 
 My life was so confused and blinded by my sin. 
 He knew there was nothing in this world that I could do, 
 That's why he sent His son to die for me and you. 
 He did what I couldn't do 
 Went to the cross so I could be forgiven. 
 He spent three days in the grave, 
 To make my life worth living. 
 And the wonder of salvation is 
 I could never be good enough. 
 He did what I couldn't do. (couldn't do) 
 Some people think they've got this whole thing figured out. 
 Living right, doing good is what they think life's all about. 
 But they need to know that there's an answer to their faith, 
 They've got to know that Jesus is the only way. 
 He did what I couldn't do 
 Went to the cross so I could be forgiven. 
 He spent three days in the grave, 
 To make my life worth living. 
 And the wonder of salvation is 
 I could never be good enough. 
 He did what I couldn't do. (couldn't do) 
 Make no mistake, this is not a fairy tale, 
 One day everybody's gonna need some help. 
 There's just no way that we could make it by ourselves. 
 He did what I couldn't do 
 Went to the cross so I could be forgiven. 
 He spent three days in the grave, 
 To make my life worth living. 
 And the wonder of salvation is 
 That I could never be good enough. 
 He did what I couldn't do. (couldn't do)

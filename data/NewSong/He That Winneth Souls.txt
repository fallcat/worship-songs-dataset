There's a battle going on through the ages 
 A war between darkness and light 
 And though some may ignore it, it still rages 
 It's time we stand up and fight 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 Going behind the enemy lines 
 Leading the captives home to Christ 
 Bless the one who shines His light 
 And leads the lost ones through the night 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 The weapons of our warfare are not carnal 
 But we are mighty through prayer 
 Let us tear down the strongholds of Satan 
 We must show the world we care 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 Going behind the enemy lines 
 Leading the captives home to Christ 
 Bless the one who shines His light 
 And leads the lost ones through the night 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 Jesus is the victor of the ages 
 And as His warriors, we must go 
 If we don't get the message to the captives 
 Then tell me how will they know 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 Going behind the enemy lines 
 Leading the captives home to Christ 
 Bless the one who shines His light 
 And leads the lost ones through the night 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 And leads the lost ones through the night 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 He that winneth souls is wise 
 Bless the one who leads the lost ones through the night

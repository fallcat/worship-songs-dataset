Heaven's flag flew at half mast 
 All creation stood quiet 
 Afraid to ask: "What comes next 
 Now that evil's in command?" 
 Satan laid down to take a rest 
 The battle was tough 
 But He proved He was the best 
 And He won, just like He planned 
 But then the stone rolled away 
 Hit a tree that shook the birds 
 Who shouted loud to the clouds 
 "Good news, have you heard?" 
 Ol' Satan woke in a huff 
 And said "What's goin' on?" 
 And all creation shouted back at Him 
 "He's gone, yes He's gone!" 
 He's gone, He's gone 
 There ain't nothing you can do 
 He's gone, He's gone 
 He's done defeated you 
 You thought Calvary was Your victory 
 But you were wrong all along 
 Three days in the grave 
 And He's gone, yes He's gone 
 Ol' Satan rolled his eyes 
 Shook his head and said: "It can't be." 
 "It's a lie, I saw Him die 
 Three days ago on Calvary." 
 "He's dead, I know He's dead 
 Somebody please tell me they're wrong." 
 And all Heavens shouted down at Him 
 "He's gone, yes He's gone!" 
 He's gone, He's gone 
 There ain't nothing you can do 
 He's gone, He's gone 
 He's done defeated you 
 You thought Calvary was Your victory 
 But you were wrong all along 
 Three days in the grave 
 And He's gone, yes He's gone 
 (He's gone) 
 He's gone, He's gone 
 There ain't nothing you can do 
 (I said, He's gone) 
 He's gone, He's gone 
 He's done defeated you 
 You thought Calvary was Your victory 
 But you were wrong all along 
 Three days in the grave... 
 And He's gone, yes He's gone 
 Gone, gone, gone...

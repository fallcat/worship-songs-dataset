Billy, I remember 
 The first time that I saw you 
 On our black and white 
 I was just a little tyke 
 But I remember it well 
 Billy, I remember 
 Wanting to grow up and be a man like you 
 Serve the Lord the way you do 
 Yes, I remember it well 
 And, Billy, through the years 
 You've been a great example of faithfulness 
 As you stood before the world 
 And you proclaimed what the Bible says 
 We know you don't want to be called a hero 
 And, Billy, we know, we understand 
 You're just another man 
 But you've been so faithful to the call 
 And, Billy, you've stood tall 
 You're a hero of the faith to us all 
 Billy, I remember 
 The miracle I saw 
 When you said, "come to Christ" 
 So many came to give their lives 
 I remember it well 
 Billy, I remember 
 Thanking God for sending us a man like you 
 Hoping He could use me too 
 Yes, I remember it well 
 And, Billy, through the years 
 You've been a great example of faithfulness 
 As you stood before the world 
 And you proclaimed what the Bible says 
 And we know you don't want to be called a hero 
 And, Billy, we know, we understand 
 You're just another man 
 But you've been so faithful to the call 
 And, Billy, you've stood tall 
 You're a hero of the faith to us all 
 You sure keep it simple 
 And you sure preach it plain 
 And, Billy, I just wish 
 More would preach it just the same 
 And we know you don't want to be called a hero 
 And, Billy, we know, we understand 
 You're just another man 
 But you've been so faithful to the call 
 And, Billy, you've stood tall 
 You're a hero of the faith to us all 
 You're a hero of the faith to us all

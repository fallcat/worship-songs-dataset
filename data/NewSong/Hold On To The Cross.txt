On a hill two-thousand years ago 
 A rugged cross was raised 
 For all the world to see 
 On that cross hung the Son of God 
 To take our sins away 
 To die for you and me 
 His sacrifice displayed a love 
 Never seen before 
 He's all my strength 
 He's all my hope 
 He's everything I live for 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 Surrender my life completely 
 Deep inside my heart I know 
 He will never let me go 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 And when this world pulls against me 
 He will be the strength I need 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 On that hill I have found a love 
 That will not fade away 
 For all eternity 
 A love so strong it 
 Reaches down through time 
 To fill my heart today 
 To live in me 
 I know that everything 
 I'll ever need is waiting there 
 My every strength, my every hope 
 The answer to my every prayer 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 Surrender my life completely 
 Deep inside my heart I know 
 He will never let me go 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 And when this world pulls against me 
 He will be the strength I need 
 I will hold on... 
 To the peace I find in knowing 
 That His love will never fail 
 To the mercy and the hope I find 
 In Him and nowhere else 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 Surrender my life completely 
 Deep inside my heart I know 
 He will never let me go 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 And when this world pulls against me 
 He will be the strength I need 
 I will hold on to the cross 
 I will Hold on to the cross

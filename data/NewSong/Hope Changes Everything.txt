Our lives were spinning in 
 A hopeless situation 
 Livin' in a fallen world 
 Without hope for change 
 But heaven heard our cries 
 And that's why Jesus came 
 Now it's up to us to give His love away 
 Let's take the hope of Christ 
 Lift it up and hold it high 
 Because hope changes everything 
 Let's take this faith we wear 
 To hurting people everywhere 
 Because hope changes everything 
 No matter how dark or troubled 
 Someone's life may seem 
 I do believe with all my heart 
 That hope changes everything 
 Everytime I see someone who's feelin' helpless 
 Everytime I hear another desperate plea 
 I'm reminded of the place where He found me 
 There's no one that's gone too far for Him to reach 
 Let's take the hope of Christ 
 Lift it up and hold it high 
 Because hope changes everything 
 Let's take this faith we wear 
 To hurting people everywhere 
 Because hope changes everything 
 No matter how dark or troubled 
 Someone's life may seem 
 I do believe with all my heart 
 That hope changes everything 
 God has placed inside of us an everlasting hope 
 And it's up to each of us to go 
 Let's take the hope of Christ 
 Lift it up and hold it high 
 Because hope changes everything 
 Let's take this faith we wear 
 To hurting people everywhere 
 Because hope changes everything 
 No matter how dark or troubled 
 Someone's life may seem 
 I do believe with all my heart 
 That hope changes everything

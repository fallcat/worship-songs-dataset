Anything you can name, I tried it 
 Doing my best to fill this hole in my heart 
 Hope was always out on the horizon 
 But I could never ever seem to reach quite that far 
 And I had everything this world could offer 
 Everything but what I needed most 
 I called out to Jesus, "Please come help me" 
 He heard my cry and He gave me hope 
 I can live for forty days and nights without a single bite to eat 
 I can live for hours and hours without a drop to drink 
 And I can hold my breath for minutes at a time 
 But I can't live a second without hope in my life 
 Now everyday I wake up smiling 
 Knowin' that He's got a perfect plan for my life 
 He's changing everything about me 
 He lets me see this great big world through His eyes 
 I can't believe the places that He takes me 
 I can't believe the joy that I feel 
 He fills my heart with so much hope for tomorrow 
 He took my life and made it oh so real 
 I can live for forty days and nights without a single bite to eat 
 I can live for hours and hours without a drop to drink 
 And I can hold my breath for minutes at a time 
 But I can't live a second without hope in my life 
 I can't live a second without hope in my life 
 Hope is my oxygen 
 The food that feeds my soul 
 Jesus quenched my deepest thirst 
 Oh, Jesus made me whole 
 I can live for forty days and nights without a single bite to eat 
 I can live for hours and hours without a drop to drink 
 And I can hold my breath for minutes at a time 
 But I can't live a second without hope in my life 
 No, I can't live a second without hope 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 Not without hope

Oh Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder 
 Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made 
 I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder 
 Thy power throughout the universe displayed 
 Ah... 
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander 
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees 
 When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur 
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God to Thee 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God to Thee 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 When Christ shall come, 
 With shouts of acclamation 
 And take me home 
 What joy shall fill my heart 
 Then I shall bow, in humble adoration 
 And there proclaim, 
 "My God, how great Thou art!" 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God to Thee 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God to Thee 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 How great... Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 Oh Lord, my God 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 Oh Lord, my God

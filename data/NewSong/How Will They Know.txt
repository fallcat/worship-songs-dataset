Our lives are living pages 
 Of what we believe 
 Every day the world will judge our Savior 
 By what they see 
 Every day we write another paragraph 
 Live it line by line 
 While all the while 
 They are watching and they're waiting 
 To make up their minds 
 How will they know 
 What will they remember 
 What will they see 
 That is different in you? 
 How will they know 
 Will they find any answers 
 In the gospel according to you? 
 Our love for one another 
 Becomes the key 
 To unlock the hearts of unbelievers 
 And set them free 
 With every choice and every situation 
 Let's remember them 
 Let them see no matter the conditions 
 We find our strength in Him 
 How will they know 
 What will they remember 
 What will they see 
 That is different in you? 
 How will they know 
 Will they find any answers 
 In the gospel according to you? 
 They want to know 
 They're out there searching 
 I think they want to hear 
 The question is 
 Will they see Jesus 
 In the lives that we live 
 Gotta make it clear 
 How will they know 
 What will they remember 
 What will they see 
 That is different in you? 
 How will they know 
 Will they find any answers 
 In the gospel according to you? 
 How will they know 
 What will they remember 
 What will they see 
 That is different in you? 
 How will they know 
 Will they find any answers 
 In the gospel according to you? 
 I said, how will they know 
 What will they remember 
 What will they see 
 That is different in you? 
 How will they know 
 Will they find any answers

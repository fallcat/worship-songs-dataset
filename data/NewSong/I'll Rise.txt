Out of Your great love 
 You came down from glory 
 The Son of God to set me free 
 And for all my sin 
 You gave yourself for Calvary 
 You rose so I could live again 
 I'll rise because You rose 
 I'll live because You died for me 
 I'll love because You first loved me 
 O Lord You are my life 
 O Lord You are my life 
 Tho I may walk 
 Through the valley of the shadow 
 I know that You are there with me 
 If I lose my way 
 I know Your hand will guide me 
 Nothing can take Your love away 
 You're all I need 
 You are the one who makes my life worth living 
 Lord here I am, take all of me 
 Take all my hopes, take all my dreams 
 That I have held so dearly 
 Lord please take it all

I don't wanna leave any doubt 
 Of whose I am or what I'm about 
 Behind every motive in me, Lord let it be You. 
 I'm not trying to make a name for myself 
 It's all for You and nobody else 
 Lord let everything that I do, be just for You. 
 In Jesus' name, let me love like You today 
 Lord, let every word I say, bring You praise 
 Lord, let every breath in me, 
 Tell the world that You we need 
 Open blinded eyes to see, in Jesus' name 
 In Jesus' name 
 You reach for me in my hopelessness 
 Rescued me and gave me Your best 
 And now I know the least I can do 
 Is make much of You, I'm for You 
 In Jesus' name, let me love like You today 
 Lord, let every word I say, bring You praise 
 Lord, let every breath in me, 
 Tell the world that You we need 
 Open blinded eyes to see, in Jesus' name 
 In Jesus' name 
 Without You I can't do nothing 
 With You I'll never fail 
 I wanna lift You higher and higher 
 Far above all else 
 Without You I can't do nothing 
 With You I'll never fail 
 I wanna lift You higher and higher 
 Far above all else 
 Far above all else 
 In Jesus' name, let me love like You today 
 Lord, let every word I say, bring You praise 
 Lord, let every breath in me, 
 Tell the world that You we need 
 Open blinded eyes to see, in Jesus' name 
 In Jesus' name 
 I don't wanna leave any doubt 
 Of whose I am or what I'm about

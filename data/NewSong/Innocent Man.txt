How could an innocent Man 
 Shed His innocent blood 
 For a sinner like me 
 How could He hang on the cross 
 Paying all of my cost 
 What kind of love could this be 
 I couldn't do it myself 
 Die for somebody else 
 But He was willing to die 
 For love crucified 
 Innocent blood of an innocent Man 
 His perfect life, a perfect plan 
 Each innocent drop eternity spans 
 Because of His innocent blood 
 I'm an innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I am an innocent man 
 "I find no fault with this Man 
 I'm gonna wash my hands" 
 Pilate decreed 
 But they yelled "Crucify! 
 Let the King of the Jews die 
 And Barabbas be freed" 
 Then up to Calvary's hill 
 They led the Man to be killed 
 And hanging there on the tree 
 He died so I could be free 
 Innocent blood of an innocent Man 
 His perfect life, a perfect plan 
 Each innocent drop eternity spans 
 Because of His innocent blood 
 I'm an innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man, ooh... 
 The final sacrifice for all sin has been made 
 By His innocent blood, my debt has been paid 
 Innocent man, innocent man 
 (I'm a free man) 
 Innocent man, innocent man 
 Yes, I am, oh, I am 
 I am an innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 I'm an innocent, innocent man 
 Innocent man 
 (I'm a free man) 
 Innocent man 
 I am an innocent man 
 I am an innocent man!

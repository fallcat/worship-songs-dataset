I'm lookin' up, the sun is shinin' 
 There's not a cloud in the sky 
 I'm feelin' free, feelin' light as a feather 
 Look out, I might just take off and fly 
 No rainy day could ever stop this party 
 God has started in my soul 
 My life's been changed, I'm a new creation 
 And I've gotta let the whole world know 
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops 
 Gonna take it to the street 
 I'm telling everybody, everyone I meet 
 It's a wonderful life that we're livin' 
 When we're livin' our life for the Lord 
 It's a wonderful thing, it makes a sad heart sing 
 Who could ever ask for more 
 All of this and heaven too 
 A life worth livin' for 
 It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life 
 Well, I don't need a whole lot of money 
 To bring me happiness 
 I don't need to search the world over 
 To find the meaning of success 
 George Bailey learned this wonderful lesson 
 Living up in Bedford Falls 
 God has a plan for every life to touch another 
 His love's the greatest gift of all 
 I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops 
 Gonna take it to the street 
 I'm telling everybody, everyone I meet 
 It's a wonderful life that we're livin' 
 When we're livin' our life for the Lord 
 It's a wonderful thing, it makes a sad heart sing 
 Who could ever ask for more 
 All of this and heaven too 
 A life worth livin' for 
 It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life 
 It's a wonderful life that we're livin' 
 When we're livin' our life for the Lord 
 It's a wonderful thing, it makes a sad heart sing 
 Who could ask for more 
 All of this and heaven too 
 A life worth livin' for 
 It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life 
 Yeah, yeah, wonderful life, oh... 
 (It's a wonderful life that we're livin') 
 Just like George Bailey 
 (It's a wonderful thing, it makes a sad heart sing...)

My dad seemed ten feet tall 
 When I was just a kid 
 And if you asked me who my hero was 
 I'd quickly tell you it was him 
 He must have had a thousand stories 
 I must have heard a million times 
 But I'll never forget as long as I live 
 Us kneeling down that day 
 Him teaching me to pray (he said) 
 It's not far from here to Jesus 
 His loving arms are open wide 
 Close your eyes and he will lead you 
 Safely to his side 
 There's no need for you to fear him 
 You can trust him with your heart 
 And it's not far 
 It's not far 
 I couldn't help but wonder how 
 The years have gone so fast 
 With every breath dad fought to take 
 I knew could be his last 
 And as we gathered round his bedside 
 And fumbled through what we would say 
 I bowed my head and began to cry 
 And whispered in his ear 
 My last goodbye (and said) 
 There is no distance 
 From the love of God 
 He's always there to hear our prayer 
 And answer when we call 
 From here to Jesus 
 It's not far 
 It's not far from here to Jesus 
 It's not far from here 
 It's not far from here to Jesus 
 It's not far 
 It's not far 
 It's not far from here 
 It's not far from here to Jesus 
 It's not far from here

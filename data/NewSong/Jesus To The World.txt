A little girl who is hungry 
 Prays for something she can eat 
 A single mom doing all she can 
 Finds herself out on the street 
 Will we see their need and hear their cries 
 Look at our watch and just walk on by 
 Or will we stop and take the time 
 To be Jesus in their lives 
 We need to be lambs that roar 
 We need to be eagles that soar 
 We need to be salt 
 We need to be light 
 We need to be Jesus to the world 
 We need to take love into the streets 
 Be willing to turn the other cheek 
 We need to be strong 
 We need to be weak 
 We need to be Jesus 
 Jesus to the world 
 Jesus came with a message 
 That would change the way we live 
 He showed us all by example 
 What the heart of heaven is 
 He saw our need and He heard our cry 
 He loved us so much that He gave His life 
 He taught us by his sacrifice 
 How we should live our lives 
 We need to be Jesus 
 Jesus to the world

Close your eyes, try to imagine 
 The world full of havin' love 
 It's a dream we just can't abandon 
 Jesus is counting on us 
 One little touch could be all it takes 
 To reach a heart in a heavenly way 
 To give them hope when every hope is gone 
 A little bit of love could live on and on 
 Just a little 
 (Just a little, just a little) 
 A little bit of Heaven goes a long, long way 
 A little bit of love from each of us 
 Could change this world today 
 So give a little 
 (Give a little, give a little) 
 Shine a little Heaven along your way 
 A little bit of love could mean so much 
 To a heart that's lost its way 
 Just a little (just a little) 
 Heaven goes a long, long way 
 Everywhere, people are searchin' 
 To fill their emptiness inside 
 Broken hearts, lonely and hurtin' 
 How can we pass them by 
 One little touch could be all it takes 
 To reach a heart in a heavenly way 
 To give them hope when every hope is gone 
 A little bit of love could live on and on 
 Just a little 
 (Just a little, just a little) 
 A little bit of Heaven goes a long, long way 
 A little bit of love from each of us 
 Could change this world today 
 So give a little 
 (Give a little, give a little) 
 Shine a little Heaven along your way 
 A little bit of love could mean so much 
 To a heart that's lost its way 
 Just a little 
 (Just a little, just a little) 
 Somewhere there's somebody 
 With a heart that it breakin' 
 Somewhere there's somebody 
 With a soul that is achin' 
 And we could be the answer 
 To the prayer that they're prayin' 
 Only Heaven knows what a difference we'll make 
 When we give a little love away 
 (A little bit of Heaven) 
 (Mm, a little bit of Heaven comes) 
 (Long, long) 
 (Long, long) 
 (Just a little, just a little) 
 (Long, long, long, long) 
 Just a little 
 (Just a little, just a little) 
 A little bit of Heaven goes a long, long way 
 A little bit of love from each of us 
 Could change this world today 
 So give a little 
 (Give a little, give a little) 
 Shine a little Heaven along your way 
 A little bit of love could mean so much 
 To a heart that's lost its way 
 Just a little (just a little) 
 Heaven goes a long, long way 
 (Just a little) 
 Just a little (just a little) 
 Heaven goes a long, long way 
 Oh, yes it does 
 Mm, yeah, just a little 
 A little bit of Heaven 
 Goes a long, long way 
 Ooh... 
 Heaven goes a long, long way

My cell phone's ringing and I'm running late 
 Morning traffic's got me 
 Time is ticking away 
 A few more hours is all that I need 
 Seems like there is just not enough days in a week 
 But then it hits me 
 Time is not the answer 
 You've given me all the time in the world 
 All that I need is 
 A little more life in my day 
 A little more of your life 
 A little more faith 
 A little more life in my day 
 A little more of your light 
 To show me the way 
 If I'm gonna be in this world but not be of it 
 Lord, I need more of you 
 In all that I do 
 Put a little more life in my day 
 Sometimes I guess I get lost in the race 
 Trying to make a deadline just to keep the pace 
 I can't help feeling I'm always behind 
 So much that I can do if I could just find the time 
 But then it hits me 
 Time is not the answer 
 You've given me all the time in the world 
 All that I need is 
 Lord, don't let be in such a hurry 
 Trying to live my life 
 That I miss you in it 
 Help me to take the time to see 
 All that I need, yeah 
 A little more life in my day

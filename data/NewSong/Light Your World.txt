Two doors down, one rocking chair is rocking 
 She sits there all alone, her husband dead and gone 
 The best years of her life they spent together 
 He was always strong, but now she's on her own 
 And the telephone never rings 
 No one laughs, no one sings 
 It's quiet there, does anyone care? 
 Light your world 
 Let the love of God shine through 
 In the little things you do 
 Light your world 
 And though your light may be 
 Reaching only two or three 
 Light your world 
 A knocking at her door breaks the silence 
 She looks out to see a little boy from down the street 
 She cracks the door, surprised that he came over 
 Flowers in his hand like a little gentleman 
 He said, "I picked these just for you 
 I hope you like the color blue 
 Could I stay a while, I love to see you smile" 
 Light your world 
 Let the love of God shine through 
 In the little things you do 
 Light your world 
 And though your light may be 
 Reaching only two or three 
 Light your world 
 It only takes a little time 
 To show someone how much you care 
 It only takes a little time 
 To answer someone's biggest prayer 
 Light your world 
 Let the love of God shine through 
 In the little things you do 
 Light your world 
 And though your light may be 
 Reaching only two or three 
 Light your world 
 Let the love of God shine through 
 In the little things you do 
 Light your world 
 And though your light may be 
 Reaching only two or three 
 Light your world 
 Let the love of God shine through 
 In the little things you do 
 Light your world 
 And though your light may be 
 Reaching only two or three 
 Light your world!

Slow down for a minute 
 Take a look at the love He gave 
 Just hold on for a minute 
 Look at how we've gone our separate ways 
 We're building walls of confusion and doubt 
 Out of pettiness and pride 
 While all the while the world we're here to love 
 Just passes right on by 
 If we could stand together 
 This world would be a better place 
 If we could love each other 
 We'd be living proof of the love He gave 
 (Of the love He gave) 
 Slow down, look around you 
 Is that your brother you see standing there 
 Just hold on, think about it 
 How can you say you just don't care 
 It's up to us, we can change this world 
 When they see love in me and you 
 How can we say that we love our God 
 If we can't love each other, too 
 If we could stand together 
 This world would be a better place 
 If we could love each other 
 We'd be living proof of the love He gave 
 We've got to get close enough to our brother's heart 
 To feel his fear and doubt 
 You know that's what it's all about 
 If we could love each other 
 We'd be living proof, living proof 
 Living proof of the love He gave 
 How can we say that we love our God 
 If we can't love each other, too 
 If we could stand together 
 This world would be a better place 
 If we could love each other 
 We'd be living proof of the love He gave 
 We've got to get close enough to our brother's heart 
 To feel his fear and doubt 
 You know that's what it's all about 
 If we could love each other 
 We'd be living proof, living proof 
 Living proof of the love He gave 
 If we could stand together 
 If we could love each other 
 This world would be a better place 
 Ooh, yeah 
 Slow down for a minute 
 (For a minute) 
 Ooh, they look into me and you 
 We must learn to love each other 
 Ooh, learn to love each other 
 Ooh, we've got to love each other 
 The world is looking for proof 
 Let give them proof 
 Let's love one another 
 If we could love each other 
 All they need is living proof 
 Of the love He gave 
 Oh, how can you say you love God 
 And not love your brother 
 Oh, let's learn to love each other 
 Proof of the love You gave

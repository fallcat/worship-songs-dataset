You heard my cry and you saw my need 
 With a father's love you reached down for me 
 And like a child learning right from wrong 
 You keep teaching me and make your ways my own 
 Sometimes I feel it's more than I can bear 
 Well, I slip and stumble but you're always there 
 Lord, your love gets in the way 
 Every time I fall 
 Every time I think there's no hope for me at all 
 When it seems my fate is to drown in my mistakes 
 Lord, your love gets in the way 
 Some days go by without a fight 
 And some days I can't do anything right 
 I do my best just to stay on track 
 But it's one step forward and two steps back 
 And when I'm feeling like I can't go on 
 I lean on you lord 'cause you're always strong 
 Lord, your love gets in the way 
 Every time I fall 
 Every time I think there's no hope for me at all 
 When it seems my fate is to drown in my mistakes 
 Lord, your love gets in the way 
 I start to wonder if I missed my call 
 The things I want to do I can't do at all 
 Your love keeps leading me right back to you 
 In spite of everything I do 
 Lord, your love gets in the way 
 Every time I fall 
 Every time I think there's no hope for me at all 
 When it seems my fate is to drown in my mistakes 
 Lord, your love gets in the way

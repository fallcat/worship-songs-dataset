It's evident that it's contagious 
 It's a deadly disease that won't let go 
 Shame is like a fire that rages 
 Is there a cure for the sickness of the soul 
 An antidote 
 Oh, love is a medicine 
 Oh, love is a medicine 
 There's a hurting world in need 
 Jesus is the remedy 
 Oh 
 Are you tired of the way you're feeling 
 Giving in to living unsatisfied 
 Are you desperate for a healing 
 There's a cure that cannot be denied 
 It brings you back to life 
 Oh, love is a medicine 
 Oh, love is a medicine 
 There's a hurting world in need 
 And Jesus is the remedy 
 Oh 
 Love replaces all the pain and takes it all away 
 Oh, love is a medicine 
 Oh, love is a medicine 
 There's a hurting world in need 
 And Jesus is the remedy, yeah 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 There's a hurting world in need 
 And Jesus is the remedy 
 Love is the medicine

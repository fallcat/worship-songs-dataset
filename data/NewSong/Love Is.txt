Love is the hammer to break 
 The hardest heart in two 
 Love is the answer to give 
 A hurting friend confused 
 Love is patient, love is kind 
 Love forgives every time 
 Love is gentle, love is blind 
 Love's forever and ever and ever and ever 
 Love is something we do 
 Not what we say 
 More than an attitude 
 Love is, haven't you heard 
 That love is a verb 
 More than a word we use 
 Love is 
 Whee-ooh, whee-ooh, whee-ooh 
 Whee-ah, whee-ooh-wah... 
 Love is the blanket that warms 
 The coldest lonely heart 
 (Whee-ooh, whee-ah...) 
 Love is the hand that you give 
 To give a friend a brand new start 
 No deposit, no return 
 Freely given, never earned 
 Love is greater than concern 
 Love's forever and ever and ever and ever 
 Love is something we do 
 Not what we say 
 More than an attitude 
 Love is, haven't you heard 
 That love is a verb 
 More than a word we use 
 Love is 
 No greater love is known 
 Than the love the Father showed us 
 Love is the Son he gave 
 So that we could see 
 His love for you and me 
 Love is 
 Not what we say 
 More than an attitude 
 Love is, haven't you heard 
 That love is a verb 
 More than a word we 
 More than a word... 
 Love is something we do 
 Whee-ooh, whee-ooh... 
 More than an attitude 
 Love is, love is, love is 
 Love is, love is 
 More than a word we use 
 Love is, love is

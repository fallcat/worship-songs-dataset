Everybody listen to me 
 Hear the message that I bring 
 It's time for us to come together 
 It's time to live what we believe 
 We are God's people 
 And He's calling us to march 
 Let's love each other 
 And show this world His heart 
 We need a love revolution 
 It's so easy to see 
 Love is the only solution 
 Time has come for us to prove 
 Just what the pow'r of love can do 
 We need a love revolution 
 It's a call to every nation 
 And everyone who wears His name 
 Time to join this fight for freedom 
 Time for us to make a change 
 We are God's people 
 And He's calling us to march 
 Let's come together 
 And show this world His heart 
 We need a love revolution 
 It's so easy to see 
 Love is the only solution 
 Time has come for us to prove 
 Just what the pow'r of love can do 
 We need a love revolution 
 The battle lines are drawn 
 You know we're in war 
 So brothers and sisters 
 What are you waiting for? 
 We need a love revolution 
 It's so easy to see 
 Love is the only solution 
 Time has come for us to prove 
 Just what the pow'r of love can do 
 We need a love revolution

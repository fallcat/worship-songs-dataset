There was a hush in the air 
 Everywhere there was a feeling 
 That love was slowly dying 
 He knew the cross He must bear 
 Still His prayer was "please forgive them 
 They don't know what they're doing" 
 But willingly He gave up His life 
 Clearly love had never paid such a price 
 Love's never been like this 
 Love's never been so strong 
 A new definition of love now exists 
 Just look how far love has gone 
 Love's never been like this 
 His mother Mary was there 
 In despair she stood there weeping 
 And watched them crucify Him 
 For Him to die was so unfair 
 No one cared, they couldn't see 
 Just how much He really loved them 
 But willingly, He gave up His life, oh... 
 Clearly love had never paid such a price 
 Love's never been like this, oh... 
 Love's never been so strong 
 A new definition of love now exists 
 Just look how far love has gone 
 Love's never been like this 
 Now love has been made complete 
 There's nothing more that we need 
 Oh, now we can know what real love can mean, yeah 
 Yeah... 
 Love's never been like this, oh... 
 Love's never been so strong 
 A new definition of love now exists 
 Just look how far love has gone, oh... 
 Love's never been like this 
 Love's never been like this 
 Love's never been so strong 
 A new definition of love now exists 
 Oh, look how far love has gone, oh... 
 Love's never been like this

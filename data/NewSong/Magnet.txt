I had a dream last night and it was so very real 
 I sat up in my bed and said, "What's this feelin' that I feel?" 
 It felt like a giant magnet was pullin' on my heart 
 Pullin' me toward heaven and into Jesus' arms 
 Well, it's the feelin' that I feel when I get real close to him 
 But a million times stronger than it had ever been 
 So I turned to my wife, said, "Baby, something's going on" 
 I said, "I believe that Jesus is callin' us home" 
 Can you feel it growin' stronger every day? 
 Can you hear it tellin' us He's on His way? 
 And no one knows the day or the hour 
 But all God's children can feel His power pullin' us to Him 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 I ran to my window and stared up into the sky 
 It looked like the clouds were parting right before my eyes 
 I listened for a trumpet or to hear an angel shout 
 And for a moment I stood frozen, I couldn't make a sound 
 Then I grabbed my wife, I said, "Baby, let's pray" 
 We said, "Jesus, we're both ready if You're comin' for us today" 
 And we laughed and we cried, and we stood up on our bed 
 And we felt like our hearts were gonna jump out of our chests 
 Can you feel it growin' stronger every day? 
 Can you hear it tellin' us He's on His way? 
 And no one knows the day or the hour 
 But all God's children can feel His power pulling us to Him 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 It was just a dream but it felt so real 
 That it's changed me, now I'm livin' differently 
 I'm telling everybody everywhere I go 
 You need to be ready 'cause nobody knows 
 When He's comin' back or when He'll call us all 
 Can you feel it growing stronger every day? 
 Can you hear it tellin' us He's on His way? 
 And no one knows the day or the hour 
 But all God's children can feel His power, it's pulling us to Him 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet, magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet of His love 
 It's the magnet, it's the magnet of His love, of His, of His love

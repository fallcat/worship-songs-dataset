A man of sorrows 
 God's rejected stone 
 Despised by the builders 
 Left to stand alone 
 But still You kept on loving 
 All our sins You called Your own 
 Laying Your foundation 
 To become our cornerstone 
 Lord, You're marvelous in our eyes 
 While we were yet sinners 
 You came and died 
 Yes, You're marvelous in our eyes 
 A more excellent Savior 
 Than words can describe 
 No longer rejected 
 Now You're glorified 
 Lord, You're marvelous 
 Marvelous in our eyes 
 The master builder 
 You taught us all Your skills 
 And left with us instructions 
 On how You'd have us build 
 May we be worthy craftsmen 
 Fulfilling all Your plans 
 With You as our foundation 
 The Rock on which we stand 
 Lord, You're marvelous in our eyes 
 While we were yet sinners 
 You came and died 
 Yes, You're marvelous in our eyes 
 A more excellent Savior 
 Than words can describe 
 No longer rejected 
 Now You're glorified 
 Lord, You're marvelous, marvelous 
 Wonderful, mighty God 
 The everlasting King 
 Lord, You're marvelous in our eyes 
 While we were yet sinners 
 You came and died 
 Yes, You're marvelous in our eyes 
 A more excellent Savior 
 Than words can describe 
 No longer rejected 
 Now You're glorified 
 Lord, You're marvelous 
 Our Prince of Peace 
 Marvelous, Almighty God 
 Marvelous, King of Kings 
 Marvelous, Lord, You're marvelous 
 Marvelous in our eyes

I never saw a man that walked on water 
 I never heard a voice that could calm the sea 
 Raise the dead or feed five thousand 
 But in my heart I do believe 
 I was in a desperate situation 
 Drowning in a sea of my own sin 
 And it would take a miracle to save me 
 That's when I reached toward heaven 
 Felt someone touch me 
 I looked up and I saw Him 
 And I believe in miracles 
 I'm a miracle myself 
 And I believe the good Lord hears 
 The ones who cry for help 
 And after all that He has done for me 
 I believe, I do believe in miracles 
 So many people look for signs and wonders 
 They miss the greatest miracle of all 
 Well it's the miracle of sweet salvation 
 That's when the God of heaven 
 Comes down to live inside of someone's heart 
 When it feels like my strength is almost gone 
 And my faith is weak 
 Lord, You're always there for me 
 You make it easy to believe

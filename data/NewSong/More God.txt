Sleepless nights, tossin' and turnin' 
 An empty feeling way down deep inside 
 Something's not right, my head is spinnin' 
 I can't help wondering, is there more to this life? 
 Little did I know, God was watchin' and waitin' 
 He heard my cry and He came to me 
 Now He's taking time filling up the empty places 
 Even giving me more than I need 
 He's more God than I can imagine 
 Gives me more love than my mind can conceive 
 And the more I trust in Him 
 The more He is faithful 
 Over and over and over, He's able 
 More God, more God, more God to me 
 Troubles come, but He is greater 
 His grace and mercy shower over me 
 I've learned to trust in my creator 
 I've learned to listen to Him faithfully 
 Every day, I know He is watching and waiting 
 He hears my cry and He comes to me 
 He keeps takin' time fillin' up the empty places 
 Even giving me more than I need 
 He's more God than I can imagine 
 Gives me more love than my mind can conceive 
 And the more I trust in Him 
 The more He is faithful 
 Over and over and over, He's able 
 More God, more God, more God to me 
 A little more peace, a little less worry 
 A little more patience and a little less hurry 
 A little more caring and a little less hurt 
 We need more and more of Him 
 Right here on this earth 
 He's more God than I can imagine 
 Gives me more love than my mind can conceive 
 And the more I trust in Him 
 The more He is faithful 
 Over and over and over, He's able 
 More God 
 More love than my mind can conceive 
 And the more I trust in Him 
 The more He is faithful 
 Over and over and over, He's able 
 More God, more God, more God to me 
 Than I can imagine 
 Gives me more love than my mind can conceive 
 And the more I trust in Him 
 The more He is faithful 
 Over and over and over, He's able 
 More God, oh...

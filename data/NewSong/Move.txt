I'm a man in need of a miracle 
 But all I have is hope 
 God I need to see Your power fall 
 Like it did in the days of old 
 I know You're who You say You are 
 Because You've proven that to me 
 But this time seems impossible 
 Won't You help my unbelief? 
 I need to see You move 
 I need to see Your hand 
 I'm trying to live by faith 
 I don't know if I can 
 But I know You love change 
 There's nothing you can't do 
 I've done all that I can 
 The rest is up to you 
 I need to see you move (oh, woh.) 
 Like Moses in the wilderness 
 Like Daniel when he prayed 
 Like Simeon in the temple when 
 He finally saw your face 
 But Lord, like them, I'm just a man 
 And I've got everything to lose 
 So what You did for them 
 Would You do for me? 
 What I'm desperate for is You 
 I need to see You move 
 I need to see Your hand 
 I'm trying to live by faith 
 I don't know if I can 
 But I know You love change 
 There's nothing you can't do 
 I've done all that I can 
 The rest is up to you 
 I need to see you move 
 I'm finding out what it really means 
 To trust You Lord with everything 
 Oh to trust You... 
 Really trust You... 
 I need to see You move 
 I need to see Your hand 
 I'm trying to live by faith 
 But I don't know if I can 
 I need to see You move 
 I need to see Your hand 
 I'm trying to live by faith 
 But I don't know if I can 
 But I know You love change 
 There's nothing you can't do 
 I've done all that I can 
 The rest is up to you 
 Oh I need to see you move (oh, woh.) 
 Oh I need to see you move (oh, woh.)

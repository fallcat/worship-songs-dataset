God is bigger than the air I breathe 
 The world we'll leave 
 God will save the day 
 And all will say 
 My Glorious 
 The world's shaking with the love of God 
 Great and glorious, let the whole earth sing 
 And all You ever do is change the old for new 
 People we believe that 
 Clouds are breaking 
 Heaven's come to earth 
 Hearts awakening let the church bells ring 
 And all You ever do is change the old for new 
 People we believe that 
 Glory glory send Your glory 
 Glory glory send Your glory 
 Glory glory send Your glory 
 Glory glory send Your glory 
 My Glorious my glorious 
 My Glorious my glorious 
 My Glorious my glorious 
 My Glorious my glorious

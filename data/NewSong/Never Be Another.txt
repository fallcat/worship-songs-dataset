Every breath of air, every grain of sand 
 Justifies to who You are 
 And the evidence, that You're magnificent 
 Is written in the moon and the stars 
 Across a million galaxies 
 The whole world in Your hands 
 And still You choose to reach for me 
 And love me as I am 
 There will never be another one like You, no 
 In my brokenness I find faithfulness 
 And peace that only You can bring 
 In Your perfect strength, there is confidence 
 With You I can do anything 
 I live my life astounded by 
 The way You rescued me 
 The cross, the grave, the love that saves 
 The power that set me free, oh 
 There will never be another one like You 
 There will never be 
 There will never be another one like You 
 High above all others You'll forever reign 
 Hallelujah, glory to Your name 
 Jesus, You and only You will never change 
 Hallelujah, glory to, glory to Your name 
 There will never be another one like You 
 There will never be another one like You, oh 
 There will never be another one like You 
 There will never be another one like You, yeah 
 Kings and kingdoms fade away 
 But Jesus You'll forever reign 
 There will never be another one like You 
 There will never be, there will never be 
 There will never be, there will never be 
 There will never be, there will never be 
 There will never be, there will never be 
 There will never be, there will never be 
 There will never be, there will never be

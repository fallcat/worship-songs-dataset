There's a shortage on corn 
 And there's a shortage on wheat 
 There's a shortage on beans 
 We've got a shortage on meat 
 Things that we're needing we just can't hardly buy 
 Soon we'll be asking if we're all gonna die 
 (Oh, but I know a good thing that there's no shortage of) 
 (Oh, but I know a great thing that there's no shortage of) 
 (Oh, thank Heaven for one thing that there's no shortage of) 
 There's no shortage on God's mercy 
 There's no shortage on God's love 
 There's a shortage on fuel oil 
 There's a shortage on gas 
 There's a shortage on wood 
 And there's a shortage on glass 
 Things that we've wasted are now precious to buy 
 You know there's even a shortage of the air in the sky 
 God is love and mercy unending 
 His precious love will lead you, no doubt 
 When from Satan you need defending 
 God has supply that will never run out 
 There's a shortage on friendship 
 There's a shortage on smiles 
 There's a shortage on neighbors 
 Though there's millions for miles 
 There's no shortage - Hmm 
 There's no shortage - Oh, no shortage on God's love 
 There's no shortage - God's got a only is over me 
 There's no shortage - My God knows is here happening 
 There's no shortage - Oh, no, no shortage on God's love 
 There's no shortage - Right now 
 No shortage of 
 There's no shortage on God's mercy 
 There's no shortage... on God's love 
 There's no shortage!

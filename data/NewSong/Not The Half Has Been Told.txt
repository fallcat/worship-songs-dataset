Mortal words can not express 
 The kingdom that's to come 
 The mind of man cannot conceive 
 The preparation that's been done 
 We speak in terms we understand 
 To uncover heaven's veil 
 But soon through eyes that clearly see 
 We'll know how words have failed 
 Not the half has been told 
 A small part not the whole 
 It's beyond imagination 
 What's in store 
 Soon our eyes will behold 
 Gates of pearl, streets of gold 
 But there's more 
 Not the half has been told 
 Not a legend or a myth 
 This grand and glorious place 
 We've barely touched the hem of it 
 And already we're amazed 
 But what is that to what's to come 
 In the presence of our God 
 Only now we can but wonder 
 But soon we'll stand in awe 
 Not the half has been told 
 A small part not the whole 
 It's beyond imagination 
 What's in store 
 Soon our eyes will behold 
 Gates of pearl, streets of gold 
 But there's more 
 Not the half has been told 
 Eyes have not seen, ears have not heard 
 Nor entered the heart of man 
 All God has prepared for those of us 
 Who love Him 
 Not the half has been told 
 A small part not the whole 
 It's beyond imagination 
 What's in store 
 Soon our eyes will behold 
 Gates of pearl, streets of gold 
 But there's more 
 Not the half has been told 
 Gates of pearl, streets of gold 
 Not the half has been told! 
 Not the half has been told!

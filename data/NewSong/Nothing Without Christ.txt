I was like a blind man on a road that led nowhere 
 Just an empty-hearted beggar in desperate need of help 
 I was poor in spirit, but he was rich in love 
 I was down to nothin' when he came to lift me up 
 Now I will never let myself forget all he has done 
 How he came and rescued me and where he brought me from 
 I am nothing without Christ, he is everything to me 
 He's the reason that I live, he is my only need 
 I know I couldn't make it through 
 One day without Jesus in my life 
 I am nothing, nothing without Christ 
 There is nothing good in me that did not come from him 
 Nothing I could boast of that he did not give 
 From the moment I cried out to him to heal my troubled soul 
 He welcomed me with open arms, said all that's mine is yours 
 Now I will never let myself forget all he has done 
 How he came and rescued me and where he brought me from 
 I am nothing without Christ, he is everything to me 
 He's the reason that I live, he is my only need 
 I know I couldn't make it through 
 One day without Jesus in my life 
 I am nothing, nothing without Christ 
 Like a wave without a seashore or a kingdom with no king 
 Without Jesus in my life, I know I wouldn't be complete 
 I am nothing without Christ, he is everything to me 
 He's the reason that I live, he is my only need 
 I know I couldn't make it through 
 One day without Jesus in my life 
 I am nothing, nothing without Christ 
 I am nothing without Christ, he is everything to me 
 He's the reason that I live, he is my only need 
 I know I couldn't make it through 
 One day without Jesus in my life 
 I am nothing, nothing without Christ

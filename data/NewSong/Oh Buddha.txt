Well, old Buddha was a man and I'm sure that he meant well 
 But I pray for his disciples lest they wind up in hell 
 And I'm sure that old Mohammed thought he knew the way 
 But it won't be Hare Krishna we stand before on The Judgment Day 
 No, it won't be old Buddha that's sitting on the throne 
 And it won't be old Mohammed that's calling us Home 
 And it won't be Hare Krishna that plays that trumpet tune 
 And we're going to see The Son, not Reverend Moon 
 Well, I don't hate anybody so please don't take me wrong 
 But there really is a message in this simple song 
 You see there's only one way Jesus if eternal life is your goal 
 Meditation of the mind won't save your soul 
 Well, you can call yourself a Baptist and not be born again 
 A Presbyterian or a Methodist and still die in your sin 
 You can even be Charismatic shout and dance and jump a few 
 But if you hate your brother you won't be one of The Chosen Few 
 'Cause it won't be a Baptist that's sitting on the throne 
 A Presbyterian or a Methodist that's calling us Home 
 And it won't be a Charismatic that plays that trumpet tune 
 So let's all just live for Jesus because He's coming back real soon 
 No, it won't be old Buddha that's sitting on the throne 
 And it won't be old Mohammed that's calling us Home 
 And it won't be Hare Krishna that plays that trumpet tune 
 And we're going to see The Son, not Reverend Moon 
 And we're going to see The Son, not Reverend Moon 
 Not Reverend Moon!

We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 A labor of love for the one we're in love with 
 Using every willing heart that we can find 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 I never thought that it would be me 
 Out here working this way 
 I never dreamed that He could use me 
 Now use me more is all I pray 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 A labor of love for the one we're in love with 
 Using every willing heart that we can find 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 Come on, along, let's work together 
 There's so much to be done 
 The time is short, so let's get busy 
 It won't be long before He comes 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 A labor of love for the one we're in love with 
 Using every willing heart that we can find 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time, ow! 
 We're working together 
 We're building the Kingdom 
 It's a labor of love 
 We're working together 
 We're building the Kingdom 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 A labor of love for the one we're in love with 
 Using every willing heart that we can find 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time 
 A labor of love for the one we're in love with 
 Using every willing heart that we can find 
 We're building the Kingdom one heart at a time...

Your are the one true god 
 The King Who reigns on high 
 No one will deny 
 You are the one true God 
 Time will only prove 
 That You and only You 
 Are the one true God 
 When the dust has settled 
 And this world is no more 
 Every saint and sinner 
 Will confess that You are Lord 
 Some will kneel as children 
 Some as conquered foes 
 Everyone from every age 
 Will bow before the throne 
 Your are the one true god 
 King who reigns on high 
 No one will deny 
 You are the one true God 
 Time will only prove 
 That You and only You 
 Are the one true God 
 Earthly kings and kingdoms 
 Rise and have their day 
 Like a mist they linger 
 Then forever fade away 
 There is none so mighty 
 Not one that compares 
 To Your majesty and glory 
 Lord the universe declares 
 Your are the one true god 
 King who reigns on high 
 No one will deny 
 You are the one true God 
 Time will only prove 
 That You and only You 
 Are the one true God 
 Awesome and holy 
 Faithful and able 
 Matchless and mighty 
 Your are the one true god 
 King who reigns on high 
 No one will deny 
 You are the one true God 
 King who reigns on high 
 No one will deny 
 Your are the one true god 
 Your are the one true god 
 Time will only prove 
 That You and only You 
 Are the one true God

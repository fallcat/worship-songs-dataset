People came from everywhere 
 They heard a man was there 
 Who could do miracles 
 There was power in his hands 
 He was like no other man 
 Could this really be the long awaited King 
 When would he rise and take His throne 
 When would he make His kingdom known 
 What was He waiting for 
 They just didn't know 
 Only the hands that bled can bless 
 Only the eyes filled with tenderness 
 Only the heart that was broken for our sins 
 Only the feet that walked that hill 
 Could love the ones who rejected Him 
 Only the one who died and is living still 
 Only the hands that bled 
 They had listened to His words 
 But few had really heard 
 What He was telling them 
 He said that He must die 
 And tried to tell them why 
 Most of them just could not understand 
 For this was the man who raised the dead 
 These were the hands that healed and feed 
 He could have stopped the nails 
 But He just let them go 
 Only the hands that bled can bless 
 Only the eyes filled with tenderness 
 Only the heart that was broken for our sins 
 Only the feet that walked that hill 
 Could love the ones who rejected Him 
 Only the one who died and is living still 
 Only the hands that bled 
 (Only the hands) 
 Only the life He sacrificed could save us 
 (Only the hands) 
 Only Jesus 
 Only the hands that bled can bless 
 Only the eyes filled with tenderness 
 Only the heart that was broken for our sins 
 (Only Jesus) 
 Only the feet that walked that hill 
 Could love the ones who rejected Him 
 Only the one who died and is living still 
 Only the hands that bled 
 Only the hands that bled can bless 
 Only the eyes filled with tenderness 
 Only the heart that was broken for our sins 
 (Only Jesus) 
 Only the feet that walked that hill 
 Could love the ones who rejected Him 
 Only the one who died and is living still 
 Only the hands that bled 
 Only the hands that bled can bless 
 Only the eyes filled with tenderness 
 Only the heart that was broken for our sins 
 (Only Jesus) 
 Only the feet that walked that hill 
 Could love the ones who rejected Him 
 Only the one who died and is living still 
 Only the hands that bled

People get ready 
 There's a train coming, yeah, yeah 
 You don't need no ticket, no 
 You just get on board, yeah 
 All you need is faith 
 To hear His diesel hummin', yeah 
 Don't need no ticket 
 You just thank the Lord 
 Just thank the Lord 
 Yeah, you just get on board 
 People get ready 
 There's a train coming 
 It's picking up passengers 
 From coast to coast 
 Faith is the key, yeah 
 Open the doors and board 'em 
 There's room for all 
 If you'll just love the Lord, yeah 
 There ain't no room 
 For the hopeless sinner 
 Who would hurt all mankind 
 Just to save his own 
 Have pity on those 
 Whose chances grow thinner 
 'Cause there's no hiding place 
 Around the kingdon's throne 
 Ooh-ooh... 
 People get ready 
 'Cause there's a train coming 
 You don't need no ticket, no 
 You just get on board 
 Faith is the key 
 Open the doors and board 'em 
 Don't need no ticket, no, no 
 You just thank the Lord 
 My Lord, my sweet Lord

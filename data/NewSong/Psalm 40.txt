I will wait for You O Lord 
 Cause You have filled my heart with joy 
 You lift me higher and higher 
 You're my one and only desire 
 You put a new song in my mouth 
 A hymn of praise to You 
 All I wanna do when I wake up 
 Is spend my day with You 
 You put a new song in my mouth 
 A hymn of praise to You 
 I put my feet on the Rock Lord 
 I put my trust in You 
 Sing a new song 
 Sing a new song 
 I will wait for You O Lord 
 I will wait for You O Lord 
 I will wait for You O Lord 
 I will wait for You O Lord 
 Cause You have filled my heart with joy 
 You lift me higher and higher 
 You're my one and only desire 
 Many will see You and fear You Lord 
 Put their trust in You 
 Many will see You and fear You Lord 
 Put their trust in You 
 Sing a new song 
 Sing a new song 
 Sing a new song 
 Sing a new song 
 I will wait 
 I will wait for You

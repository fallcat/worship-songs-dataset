Now if you feel that you can't go on 
 Because all of your hope is gone 
 And your life is filled with much confusion 
 Until happiness is just an illusion 
 And your world around is crumbling down 
 Come on and reach out 
 Come on, world 
 Reach out 
 Reach out for me 
 I'll be there 
 With a love that will shelter you 
 And I'll be there 
 With a love that will see you through 
 When you feel lost and about to give up 
 'Cause your best just ain't good enough 
 And your feel like the world has grown cold 
 And your drifting out all on your own 
 And you need a hand to hold 
 Come on, world, and reach out 
 Reach your hand out 
 Reach out 
 Reach out for me 
 I'll be there 
 With a love that will shelter you 
 And I'll be there 
 With a love that will see you through 
 I can tell the way you hang your head 
 You're alone now and you're afraid 
 And through your tears you look around 
 But there's no peace of mind to be found 
 I know what your thinking 
 You're alone now, no love of your own 
 Come on, world, and reach out 
 Reach out 
 Reach out 
 Reach out for me 
 Jesus said... 
 I'll be there 
 To love and comfort you 
 I'll be there 
 With a love that will shelter you...

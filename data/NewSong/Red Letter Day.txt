Every day before the rush gets started 
 I get down on my knees 
 And I pray, Lord, I need You here to guide me 
 Please speak to me 
 And something happens that I can't explain 
 His Word starts talking to me and 
 I'm out to face this world again 
 I do believe it's gonna be another red letter day 
 I do believe it's gonna be another chance for me 
 To take His Word and walk by faith 
 I got a smile with every step I take 
 Knowing He is here with me 
 It's gonna be a red letter day 
 I had a friend call me up and tell me 
 How he struggles through each day 
 I told him that I didn't have all of the answers 
 This world's a crazy place 
 I've learned to hide God's word in my heart 
 So I can have it with me when the pressures of the day start 
 So many hidden treasures in God's Word for us to find 
 The mysteries and secrets that are there to bring us life

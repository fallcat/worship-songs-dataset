You are the source of life 
 And I can't be left behind 
 No one else will do 
 I will take hold of you 
 I need You Jesus 
 To come to my rescue 
 Where else can I go 
 There's no other name by 
 Which I am saved 
 Capture me with Love 
 My heart is yours for life 
 And I need your hand in mine 
 No one else will do 
 I put my trust in you 
 I will follow you 
 This world has nothing for me.

Read it in the paper, see it on the news, an everyday reminder of the times we're going through. 
 Brother fighting brother, faces filled with hated, from Africa to Bosnia, from New York to L.A. 
 The rhythm of the hands of time, are beating out a sound; 
 Like an orchestra in motion, creation is calling out! 
 That's the rhythm of the World. 
 Moving us closer to the day of His return 
 That's the rhythm of the world. 
 And it gets stronger every time this big ball turns! 
 Every day we're closer than before, that's the rhythm of the World! 
 Our lives are spinning faster than, we ever thought they could. 
 And we see more hurting people, than we ever dreamed we would. 
 But, don't let your heart be troubled, all this sorrow must take place, 
 They're warning signs from heaven telling us He's on His way!

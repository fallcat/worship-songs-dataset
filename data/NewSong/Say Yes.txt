The questions come from far and near 
 The pressure comes from our peers 
 They want to know just how far we'll go 
 The answer we've been told is to just say no 
 Uh-uh, oh, no, not me, forget it, negative 
 Get out of here, no, oh-whoa 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 How can you do better till you've trusted the best 
 Jesus is the answer to life's test 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 
 I said, say yeah, yeah 
 Say, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Say yes 
 Now listen close to me, my friend 
 I've told you once, now I'll tell you again 
 Jesus alone can give you strength to know 
 When to say yes and when to say no 
 Uh-uh, oh, no, not me, forget it, negative 
 Get out of here, no, oh-whoa 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 How can you do better till you've trusted the best 
 Jesus is the answer to life's test 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 
 I said, say yeah, yeah 
 Say, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 How can you do better till you've trusted the best 
 Jesus is the answer to life's test 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 How can you do better till you've trusted the best 
 Jesus is the answer to life's test 
 How can you say no 
 Oh, how can you say no 
 How can you say no till you say yes 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh...

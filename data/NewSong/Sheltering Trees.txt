It's been said a friend is like a mighty sheltering tree 
 A place of refuge we can run when trouble comes for you and me 
 Someone we can count on through the thick and thin 
 When the storms of life are blowing, there's 
 Just nothing like a friend 
 (There's just nothing like a friend) 
 We all need sheltering trees 
 Friends in our lives who'll get down on their knees 
 And lift us up before the king of kings 
 We all need sheltering trees 
 There've been days that I was sure that I couldn't make it through 
 Clouds of doubt came rolling in and I didn't know what I would do 
 I would've given in and said I just can't go on 
 If it hadn't been for a friend that helped me to be strong 
 (Helped me to be strong) 
 We all need sheltering trees 
 Friends in our lives who'll get down on their knees 
 And lift us up before the king of kings 
 We all need sheltering trees 
 You can face the highest mountain and 
 The climb won't feel so high 
 Or cross the darkest valley and it won't seem so wide 
 Nothing is impossible when a friend is by your side 
 We all need sheltering trees 
 Friends in our lives who'll get down on their knees 
 And lift us up before the king of kings 
 We all need sheltering trees 
 We all need sheltering trees 
 Friends in our lives who'll get down on their knees 
 And lift us up before the king of kings 
 We all need sheltering trees

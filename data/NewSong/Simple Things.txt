Another day is waking up 
 As I stumble to my feet 
 Down the stairs, You're waiting there 
 At the secret place we meet 
 And I wasn't long on my knees 
 Till I heard You whispering 
 That the greatest gifts in this life 
 Are found in the simple things 
 And I closed my eyes 
 And I searched for words 
 Words to describe this thankfulness 
 I feel inside 
 And my heart begins to sing a song 
 Of gratitude to You 
 A song of praise for the simple things 
 So much to do, so little time 
 We hurry through each day 
 We seldom see the treasures 
 God has placed along the way 
 The simple things that make us laugh 
 And sometimes make us cry 
 The little blessings God has placed 
 In each and every life 
 And I closed my eyes 
 And I searched for words 
 Words to describe this thankfulness 
 I feel inside 
 And my heart begins to sing a song 
 Of gratitude to You 
 A song of praise for the simple things 
 A childlike faith is such a simple thing 
 That's all You ask a searching heart to bring 
 And I closed my eyes 
 And I searched for words 
 Words to describe this thankfulness 
 I feel inside 
 And my heart begins to sing a song 
 Of gratitude to You 
 A song of praise for the simple things 
 A song of praise for the simple things 
 A song of praise for the simple things 
 Ooh, yeah

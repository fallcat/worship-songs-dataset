I saw a sailboat slipping by on a glassy sea 
 Not a sound made as it moved effortlessly 
 I thought of You, Lord, and of Your love 
 And of Your plan for me 
 How You charted my course and set my sail 
 And blew me out to sea 
 Smooth sailing 
 Trusting in You, Lord 
 Smooth sailing 
 Resting in Your Word 
 And though storms may come and threaten 
 And though dark clouds block my view 
 It's smooth sailing, Lord, with You 
 Oceans of blessings carry me over troubled seas 
 Circumstances all around threaten me 
 But let the wind blow, because I know 
 You're the master of the wind 
 And I know that You love me, know You care 
 You're closer than a friend 
 Smooth sailing 
 Trusting in You, Lord 
 Smooth sailing 
 Resting in Your Word 
 And though storms may come and threaten 
 And though dark clouds block my view 
 It's smooth sailing, Lord, with You 
 Smooth sailing, Lord, with You

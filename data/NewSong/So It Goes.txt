The prayer goes up, the blessing comes down 
 Plant the seed and it goes round and round 
 Sparrow flies and falls to the ground 
 And He knows, so it goes, so it goes, so it goes 
 A friend is sick, pray and believe 
 Lift him up, down on your knees 
 Big or small, no matter your need 
 And He knows, so it goes, so it goes, so it goes 
 I've been walking this road for such a long time 
 He's been calling me His and I've been calling Him mine 
 Every promise He's made in His word has been true 
 Again and again and again 
 So it goes, so it goes 
 Every child of the Father knows 
 He's always faithful to His 
 That's just the way that He is 
 So it goes, so it goes 
 A promise made, a promise kept 
 When you need hope, He'll be your help 
 Your every breath, every thought, every step 
 He knows, so it goes, so it goes, so it goes 
 His character is never in doubt 
 Temptations come and he makes a way out 
 When you lose sight of what life's all about 
 He knows, so it goes, so it goes, so it goes 
 I've been walking this road for such a long time 
 He's been calling me His and I've been calling Him mine 
 Every promise He's made in His word has been true 
 Again and again and again 
 So it goes, so it goes 
 Every child of the Father knows 
 He's always faithful to His 
 That's just the way that He is 
 So it goes, so it goes 
 So it goes, so it goes 
 The prayer goes up, the blessing comes down 
 Come on down, ah-ah... 
 Ooh... mm-mm-mm-mm, yeah

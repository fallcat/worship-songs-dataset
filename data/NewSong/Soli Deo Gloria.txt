You could hear them in the temple 
 The saints of long ago 
 Worshipping and praising the Lord 
 Though the language was not ours 
 It's still Him they adore 
 And He's the one that all the praise was for 
 Soli deo gloria 
 To God alone be the glory 
 For He alone is worthy of our praise 
 Soli deo gloria 
 No matter how you say it 
 To God alone be the glory always 
 The tongue of every nation 
 The Father understands 
 He needs no interpretation done 
 You see, the only thing that matters 
 Is the heart of the man 
 Not the words but the reason that it's sung 
 Soli deo gloria 
 To God alone be the glory 
 For He alone is worthy of our praise 
 Soli deo gloria 
 No matter how you say it 
 To God alone be the glory always 
 We lift our voices 
 He is exalted 
 Ooh, ooh, yes! 
 Soli deo gloria 
 To God alone be the glory 
 For He alone is worthy of our praise 
 Soli deo gloria 
 No matter how you say it 
 To God alone be the glory always 
 Soli deo gloria 
 To God alone be the glory 
 For He alone is worthy of our praise 
 (He is worthy of our praise) 
 Soli deo gloria 
 (Oh, gloria) 
 No matter how you say it 
 To God alone be the glory 
 To God alone be the glory 
 To God alone be the glory always 
 Soli deo gloria!

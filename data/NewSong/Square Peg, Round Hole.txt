Deep inside our hearts is a godlike shape 
 A perfect fit for Jesus in every way 
 No heart is too big, no heart too small 
 He's the missing piece in one and all 
 The problem is we fill it up 
 With every other thing under the sun 
 And it can't be done, oh, no 
 Everything we substitute 
 Just causes us pain and abuse 
 And it's just no use 
 A square peg won't go in a round hole, no 
 Well, it just won't fit 
 There's not enough of it 
 Well, you can try to fill your life 
 With everything but Christ 
 But it just won't go 
 Square peg, round hole 
 You got to get it right 
 Got to get it right 
 Love is made to give and not to take 
 Hearts are made to fill and not to break 
 A perfect heart, big or small 
 Jesus is the answer, He fits them all 
 The problem is we fill it up 
 With every other thing under the sun 
 And it can't be done 
 Everything we substitute 
 Just causes us pain and abuse 
 And it's just no use 
 You gotta believe that... 
 A square peg won't go in a round hole, no 
 Well, it just won't fit, oh, no 
 There's not enough of it 
 Well, you can try to fill your life 
 With everything but Christ 
 But it just won't go, mm-mmm 
 Square peg, round hole 
 You got to get it right 
 Got to get it right 
 Take a little step of faith 
 You gotta believe 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... 
 He's the one and only way 
 He's all that you need 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... 
 A square peg won't go in a round hole, no 
 Well, it just won't fit 
 There's not enough of it 
 Well, you can try to fill your life 
 With everything but Christ 
 But it just won't go 
 Square peg, round hole 
 You got to get it right 
 Got to get it right 
 A square peg won't go in a round hole, no 
 Well, it just won't fit 
 There's not enough of it 
 Well, you can try with all your might 
 You can push and fight 
 But it just won't go 
 Square peg, round hole 
 You got to get it right 
 Got to get it right 
 Ooh, yeah! 
 You know you gotta take a step of faith 
 Ooh, gotta get it right, get it right 
 Ooh, yeah!

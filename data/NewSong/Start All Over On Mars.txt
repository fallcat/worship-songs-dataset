Sometimes I wonder how You could ever love us 
 We're never satisfied no matter what You do 
 You send the rain and we complain there's no sunshine 
 Yet every breath we take is all because of You 
 Only Heaven knows the pain 
 We put You through 
 I don't know what You're thinking, Lord 
 But I know what I would do 
 I'd start all over on Mars 
 Create a world that is 
 Far away from our ungratefulness 
 If I were the God that You are 
 I would be tempted to walk away 
 Wash my hands of this crazy mess 
 Make a world that would follow Your heart 
 I'd start all over on Mars 
 Sometimes I wonder will things get any better 
 Looks like we haven't changed since the dawn of time 
 You light the way, still we stay in darkness 
 And we try to tell ourselves that we will be just fine 
 Only Heaven knows the pain 
 We put You through 
 I don't know what You're thinking, Lord 
 But I know what I would do 
 Lord, I'm sure that You know 
 Where this crazy world is headed 
 And I'm sure You know 
 Just what the future holds 
 Don't give up on us, Lord 
 Even though we don't deserve it 
 It's good to know that 
 You're in control

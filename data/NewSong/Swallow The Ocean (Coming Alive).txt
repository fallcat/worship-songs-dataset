Who can stand apart from Your presence? 
 Once we have tasted, the goodness of Your love 
 Who can change a heart? Only You can 
 We're restless and thirsty, for healing from above 
 You break the heavens open 
 And I'm trying to swallow the ocean 
 I'm coming alive with You 
 I'm coming undone with You 
 I'm coming away with You 
 With the faith of a child I come 
 With my hands lifted high I come 
 I'm coming alive with You 
 Who can know Your thoughts and Your purpose? 
 I want to join in, to listen and obey 
 Who can do the things that You can? 
 If its impossible, Lord You know the way 
 You break the heavens open 
 And I'm trying to swallow the ocean 
 I'm coming alive with You 
 I'm coming undone with You 
 I'm coming away with You 
 With the faith of a child I come 
 With my hands lifted high I come 
 I'm coming alive with You 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 You make all things new 
 I'm coming alive with You 
 I'm coming undone with You 
 I'm coming away with You 
 With the faith of a child I come 
 With my hands lifted high I come 
 I'm coming alive with You

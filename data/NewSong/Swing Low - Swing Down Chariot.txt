Swing low, sweet chariot 
 Come for to carry me home 
 (2x) 
 Why don't you swing down chariot 
 Stop and let me ride 
 Swing down chariot 
 Stop and let me ride 
 Rock me Lord, rock me Lord 
 Calm and easy 
 I've got a home on the other side 
 Swing down, swing down, swing down 
 Swing down, swing down, swing down 
 Well, well, well, well, well, well 
 Well, Ezekial went down in the middle of a field 
 He saw an angel workin' on a chariot wheel 
 Wasn't so particular 'bout the chariot wheel 
 He just wanted to see how a chariot feel 
 Well, Ezekial went down and he got on board 
 And chariot went a bumpin' on down the road 
 Wasn't so particular 'bout the bumpin' of the road 
 He just wanted to lay down his heavy load 
 Swing down chariot 
 Stop and let me ride 
 Swing down chariot 
 Stop and let me ride 
 Rock me lord, rock me lord 
 Calm and easy 
 I've got a home on the other side

There's a voice that you alone can hear inside 
 If you listen, it will be your guide in life 
 Step by step, helping you along 
 You don't ever have to be alone, all alone 
 And it's talking to you 
 Softly speaking, teaching you the way 
 And it's talking to you 
 Can't you hear the voice of the Lord 
 Holy Spirit, closer than the breath we breathe 
 Gentle helper prompting every word we speak 
 Giving peace to all who will obey 
 Encouraging us on everyday, everyday 
 And it's talking to you 
 Softly speaking, teaching you the way 
 And it's talking to you 
 Can't you hear the voice of the Lord 
 He speaks so quietly 
 So listen closely 
 His voice is the only one you need to hear 
 Talking to you 
 Softly speaking, teaching you the way 
 And it's talking to you 
 Can't you hear the voice of the Lord 
 Can't you hear the voice of the Lord 
 Softly speaking, teaching you the way 
 Can't you hear the voice of the Lord 
 Talking to you

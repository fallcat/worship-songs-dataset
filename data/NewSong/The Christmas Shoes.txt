It was almost Christmas time 
 And there I stood in another line 
 Trying to buy that last gift or two 
 Not really in the Christmas mood 
 Standing right in front of me 
 Was a little boy waiting anxiously 
 Pacing 'round like little boys do 
 And in his hands he held a pair of shoes 
 And his clothes were worn and old 
 He was dirty from head to toe 
 And when it came his time to pay 
 I couldn't believe what I heard him say 
 "Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please 
 It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size 
 Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time 
 You see, she's been sick for quite awhile 
 And I know these shoes would make her smile 
 And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight" 
 He counted pennies for what seemed like years 
 Then the Cashier said, "Son, there's not enough here" 
 He searched his pockets frantically 
 Then he turned and he looked at me 
 He said "Mama made Christmas good at our house 
 "Though most years she just did without, 
 "Tell me, sir, what am I going to do, 
 "Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes" 
 So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out 
 I'll never forget the look on his face when he said 
 "Mama's gonna look so great" 
 "Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please 
 It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size 
 Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time 
 You see, she's been sick for quite awhile 
 And I know these shoes would make her smile 
 And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight" 
 I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love 
 As he thanked me and ran out 
 I knew that God had sent that little boy 
 To remind me just what Christmas is all about 
 "Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please 
 It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size 
 Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time 
 You see, she's been sick for quite awhile 
 And I know these shoes would make her smile 
 And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight" 
 "I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight"

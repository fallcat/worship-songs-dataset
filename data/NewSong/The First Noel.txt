The first Noel, the angel did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the king of Israel 
 They looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the east beyond them far 
 And to the earth it gave great light 
 And so it continued both day and night 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the king of Israel 
 And let us all with one accord 
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord 
 That hath made heaven and earth of nought 
 And with his blood mankind hath brought 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the king of Israel

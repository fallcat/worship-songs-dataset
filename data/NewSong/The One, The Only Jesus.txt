He's the one that I turn to 
 When things don't turn out right 
 The only one I depend on 
 To help me make it through the night 
 He's my warm winter blanket 
 When I'm cold and alone 
 He's my rock, He's my refuge 
 He is my song 
 He's the one, the only Jesus 
 The only one worthy of our praise 
 He is the Holy One 
 He is God's only Son 
 The one, the only Jesus 
 He's the resident King 
 In the castle of my heart 
 The only friend that I have 
 That will never depart 
 Oh, He's creation's Creator 
 He handcrafted each part 
 The only Son of the only One 
 And He knows me by heart 
 He's the one, the only Jesus 
 The only one worthy of our praise 
 He is the Holy One 
 He is God's only Son 
 The one, the only 
 Jesus, King of Kings 
 Jesus, He's everything 
 Everything I hoped that He would be 
 He's the one, the only Jesus 
 The only one worthy of our praise 
 He is the Holy One 
 He is God's only Son 
 The one, the only Jesus 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

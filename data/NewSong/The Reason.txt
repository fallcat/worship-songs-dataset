What a savior, what a love divine 
 How we need you with us all the time 
 How could we forget you; we will not forget 
 You are the reason the lost will be found again 
 You are the reason the last will be first and when 
 We see your glory, Jesus, we'll see the reason 
 Love is your voice, and you give us a song to sing 
 Love is the cross where you gave everything 
 If the world has a hope to believe in 
 You are the reason 
 Not in what we do, but in what you've done 
 Not in our strength but yours, you rescued us 
 We're your children, and you are the father who loves 
 How we need you and Lord, you are more than enough 
 You are the reason the lost will be found again 
 You are the reason the last will be first and when 
 We see your glory, Jesus, we'll see the reason 
 Love is your voice, and you give us a song to sing 
 Love is the cross where you gave everything 
 If the world has a hope to believe in 
 You are the reason 
 We will bow down; we will look up 
 We will rejoice because of your goodness 
 We will sing loud, we will cry out 
 Let all the earth resound and tell of your glory 
 You are the reason the lost will be found again 
 You are the reason the last will be first and when 
 We see your glory, Jesus, we'll see the reason 
 Love is your voice, and you give us a song to sing 
 Love is the cross where you gave everything 
 If the world has a hope to believe in 
 You are the reason

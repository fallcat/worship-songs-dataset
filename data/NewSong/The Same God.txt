Back to the wall, scared you'll fall 
 What you going to do, day and night 
 Don't know why it's like the world's against you 
 You're praying for a breakthrough 
 There was a day when your faith couldn't be held down 
 God was near enough to hear every word 
 But somehow you wish 
 He heard you right now, don't you know 
 The same God with you then is with you now 
 The same God who led you in will lead you out 
 So take all the fear and doubt, go on and lay them down 
 The same God, the same God is with you now 
 Oh, can't you see everything happens for a reason 
 There's a time, there's a place 
 For every season, He knows what's best for you 
 So don't be afraid 
 The same God with you then is with you now, oh 
 The same God who led you in will lead you out 
 So take all the fear and doubt, go on and lay them down 
 The same God, the same God is with you now 
 Just keep holding on, oh, keep holding on 
 Just keep holding on, just keep holding on 
 The same God with you then is with you now, oh 
 The same God who led you in will lead you out 
 So take all the fear and doubt, go on and lay them down 
 The same God, the same God is with you now

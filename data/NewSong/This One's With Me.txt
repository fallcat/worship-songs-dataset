I was dreaming about heaven 
 I was standing at the pearling gates 
 We all there 
 And I was so scared in the presence of One so great 
 I felt so worried and unworthy 
 I felt like running away 
 I bowed my head and I turn to go 
 Then I heard someone say 
 Father, this one's with me 
 Part of the family 
 One of the reasons I died 
 On Calvary 
 Father, Welcome him in 
 I paid the price for him 
 Father, Oh Father, this ones with me 
 I was dreaming about heaven 
 When I looked up the gates were opened wide 
 And in the distance, I saw Jesus 
 Our eyes met, and I began to cry 
 Angels rolled in their beauty, 
 Were there to show me the way 
 And all of heaven singing 
 When I heard his voice say 
 Father, this one's with me 
 Part of the family 
 One of the reasons I died 
 On Calvary 
 Father, Welcome him in 
 I paid the price for him 
 Father, Oh Father, this one's with me 
 Finally, we were there face to face 
 And he placed on me heaven's crown 
 I fell down on my knees 
 Laid my crown at his feet 
 Then he said, to me 
 Father, this one's with me 
 Part of the family 
 One of the reasons I died 
 On Calvary 
 Father, Welcome him in 
 I paid the price for him 
 Father, Oh Father, this one's with me.

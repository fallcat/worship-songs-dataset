Can you hear the cry of humanity 
 Desperate and in need, a fractured creation 
 Innocence for sale on every street 
 Poverty and unbelief 
 The love is growing colder 
 Let it not be said of us 
 We've done each other wrong 
 By giving up home and doing nothing at all 
 This world is ours to love 
 This world is ours to love 
 Now is our time to stand up 
 Let heaven shine through us 
 Revealing like a flood 
 Mercy come through us the world is ours to love 
 Whoa 
 We all know divided house fall 
 When we stand alone 
 It doesn't look like love at all 
 So let us be your hope your hands your feet 
 To help the least of these 
 God we know You'll be enough 
 Oh, though the earth will pass away 
 Your kingdom will remain 
 It's here in us now, it's here in us now 
 This world is ours to love 
 This world is ours to love 
 Now is our time to stand up 
 Let heaven shine through us 
 Revealing like a flood 
 Mercy come through us the world is ours to love 
 Whoa, Whoa, Whoa 
 So let Your kingdom come 
 Your will be done 
 Here in us now 
 So let Your kingdom come 
 Your will be done 
 Here in us now 
 You're here in us now 
 You're here in us now 
 Yeah 
 This world is ours to love 
 This world is ours to love 
 Now is our time to stand up 
 Let heaven shine through us 
 Revealing like a flood 
 Mercy come through us the world is ours to love 
 Whoa 
 This world is ours to love 
 This world is ours to love 
 Yeah

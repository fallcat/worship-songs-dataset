With one eye open I saw her slowly start to stand 
 Her trembling hands wiped her tears away 
 She looked so tired and broken, she never lifts her head 
 She softly says I can't make it through another day 
 I'm as far away from God as I can be 
 Is there any way that He still loves me? 
 Can He still love me? 
 If there were a thousand steps between you and God 
 And you could see no way across the great divide 
 Just take one step toward His loving arms 
 And He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 He slips into the back door and he straightens up his tie 
 His bloodshot eyes tell of the night before 
 He comes here every Sunday but his life is never changed 
 He's played the game but he knows there's something more 
 And I'm so close but still so far away 
 And I can't live like this another day 
 Not another day 
 If there were a thousand steps between you and God 
 And you could see no way across the great divide 
 Just take one step toward His loving arms 
 And He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 Yeah, He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 Maybe you think that there's a place you can go and He won't be there 
 And He won't even care 
 Didn't you know that there's no depth or height to keep us from 
 His amazing love? 
 And if there were a thousand steps between you and God 
 And you could see no way 'cross the great divide 
 Then just take one step toward His loving arms 
 And He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 Yeah, He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 Nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 Take one step, take one step 
 He'll cross the great divide 
 Nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 Nine hundred and ninety-nine 
 Nine hundred and ninety-nine

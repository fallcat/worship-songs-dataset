Every day I'm faced with decisions 
 Every day I have to choose 
 Sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's easy 
 Ooh, sometimes I win, sometimes I lose 
 But God has placed in me a way to stay near Him 
 And if I listen with my heart, I can hear Him 
 His voice keeps leadin' me down life's road 
 Like a thunder that's with me every step I go 
 I'm walkin' down thunder road 
 Following the footsteps of the one I love 
 He whispers to my heart and it thunders in my soul 
 I'm walkin', walkin' down thunder road 
 Anytime I get discouraged 
 Anytime I start to fall 
 I don't give up and I don't worry 
 He's there for me whenever I call 
 He has placed in me a way to stay near to Him 
 And if I listen with my heart, I can hear Him 
 His voice keeps leadin' me down life's road 
 Like a thunder that's with me every step I go 
 I'm walkin' down thunder road 
 Following the footsteps of the one I love 
 He whispers to my heart and it thunders in my soul 
 I'm walkin', walkin' down thunder road 
 And when it starts to rain 
 I just keep on walkin' 
 When I'm feeling pain 
 I just keep on walkin' 
 When the storm winds blow 
 I just keep on walkin' 
 And when it's dark and cold 
 I just keep on walkin' 
 When I'm feeling all alone 
 I just keep on walkin' 
 When all my strength is gone 
 I just keep on walkin' 
 Oh, I just keep walkin' 
 I'm walkin' down thunder road 
 Following the footsteps of the one I love 
 He whispers to my heart and it thunders in my soul 
 I'm walkin', walkin' down thunder road 
 I'm walkin' down thunder road 
 Following the footsteps of the one I love 
 He whispers to my heart and it thunders in my soul 
 I'm walkin', walkin' down thunder road...

Who else could create the Earth 
 Put it in place with just a word 
 Light the sun and moon, only You 
 Breathe into a hand of dirt 
 Form it into hearts that burn for You 
 Lord, we burn for You 
 'Cause Your love is unsearchable 
 Your thoughts unexplainable 
 And still You delight in Your children 
 Simply singing out to You 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 Only You can show us who You are 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 Who that knows a father's love 
 Would give away His only Son 
 For the sake of fools, only You 
 And who could take His fallen Son 
 And bring Him back to life for us? 
 Lord, we know it's true, only you 
 'Cause Your love is unsearchable 
 And your thoughts unexplainable 
 And still You delight in Your children 
 Simply singing out to You 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 And only You can show us who You are 
 You're too wonderful 
 And we sing out for Your wondrous creation 
 We sing out for the gift of Your Son 
 We sing out for the wonder that is Your amazing love for us 
 And we sing out for Your wondrous creation 
 We sing out for the gift of Your Son 
 Your amazing love for us 
 You're too wonderful 
 You're too wonderful 
 You're too wonderful 
 You are wonderful 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 Only You can show us who You are 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 You're too wonderful for words 
 Only You can show us who You are 
 Who You are 
 Too wonderful for words 
 Too wonderful for words

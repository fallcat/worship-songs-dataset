We were dead in our sins 
 Hopelessly bound within 
 But the One who created us 
 Brought us to life again 
 Our deliverance was won 
 By the blood of His Son 
 Who was crucified 
 And though it's hard to believe 
 Our God could receive 
 No greater prize 
 We are trophies of grace 
 Perfectly placed in the body 
 Bought with a price 
 The supreme sacrifice of our Lord 
 We were wooed by His Spirit 
 We were won by His love 
 Exalted with Him to a heavenly place 
 We are trophies of grace 
 Let us live unto Him 
 Trusting His strength alone 
 Representing our Lord in this world 
 As we make Him known 
 And like trophies displayed 
 Our lives will convey 
 What His love will do 
 And we will not be ashamed 
 To lift up His name 
 And declare His truth 
 We are trophies of grace 
 Perfectly placed in the body 
 Bought with a price 
 The supreme sacrifice of our Lord 
 We were wooed by His Spirit 
 We were won by His love 
 Exalted with Him to a heavenly place 
 I've been exalted to a heavenly place 
 Exalted with Him to a heavenly place 
 We are trophies of grace

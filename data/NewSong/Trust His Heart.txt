All things work for our good 
 Though sometimes we can't see how they could 
 Struggles that break our hearts in two 
 Sometimes blind us to the truth 
 Our Father knows what's best for us 
 His ways are not our own 
 So when your pathway grows dim 
 And you just can't see Him 
 Remember, He's still on the throne 
 God is too wise to be mistaken 
 God is too good to be unkind 
 So when you don't understand 
 When don't see His plan 
 When you can't trace His hand 
 Trust His Heart 
 He sees the masterplan 
 He holds our future in His hands 
 So don't live as those who have no hope 
 All our hope is found in Him 
 We walk in present knowledge 
 But He sees the first and the last 
 And like a tapestry, He's weaving you and me 
 To someday be just like Him, oh... 
 God is too wise to be mistaken 
 God is too good to be unkind 
 So when you don't understand 
 When don't see His plan 
 When you can't trace His hand 
 Trust His Heart, oh... 
 He alone is faithful and true 
 He alone knows what is best for you, oh... 
 God is too wise to be mistaken 
 God is too good to be unkind 
 (Lord knows He is so kind) 
 So when you don't understand 
 When don't see His plan 
 When you can't trace His hand 
 Trust His Heart 
 When you can't trace His hand 
 Trust His Heart

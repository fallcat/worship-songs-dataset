Tug of, tug of war! 
 It's a tug o' war 
 Whoo-hoo... 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We're being pulled back and forth 
 First a little bit less 
 Then a little bit more 
 Hey, we're in a fight 
 The forces of darkness 
 And the children of the light 
 Tug of war 
 Huh! 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We're being pulled back and forth 
 First a little bit less 
 Then a little bit more 
 Hey, we're in a fight 
 The forces of darkness 
 And the children of the light 
 Like it or not 
 The rope is in our hands 
 We have to be strong 
 We have to take our stand 
 No time to turn and walk away 
 The war is going on 
 Each and every day 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We're being pulled back and forth 
 First a little bit less 
 Then a little bit more 
 (Little bit more) 
 Hey! 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We're being pulled back and forth 
 First a little bit less 
 Then a little bit more 
 Hey, hey, we're in a fight 
 The forces of darkness 
 And the children of the light 
 It's a tug o', tug o', tug o' 
 Tug o' war 
 Huh! 
 It's a tug o', tug o', tug o', tug o', tug o' 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We've got to hide 
 His Word down in our hearts 
 We've got to take time 
 Before each new day starts 
 It's up to us, me and you 
 Yes, it is 
 The rope is in our hands 
 What are we gonna do 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We're being pulled back and forth 
 (Pulled back, pulled back, pulled back) 
 First a little bit less 
 Then a little bit more 
 Hey, we're in a fight 
 The forces of darkness 
 And the children of the light 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We're being pulled back and forth 
 (Pulled back, pulled back, pulled back) 
 First a little bit less 
 Then a little bit more 
 (A little bit more) 
 We're in a fight 
 The forces of darkness 
 And the children of the light 
 It's a tug o' war 
 Pulled back, pulled back 
 Hey, we're in a fight 
 The forces of darkness 
 And the children of the light 
 It's a tug o' war 
 We're being pulled back and forth 
 (Pulled back, pulled back, pulled back) 
 First a little bit less 
 Then a little bit more 
 (A little bit more) 
 Hey, we're in a fight 
 The forces of darkness 
 And the children of the light 
 It's a tug o' war

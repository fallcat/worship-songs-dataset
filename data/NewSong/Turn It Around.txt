I might be wrong, but I'm feeling 
 This world is slowing down 
 It won't be long till were leaving 
 Without a warning or a sound 
 Well, it causes me mixed emotions 
 I'm torn between here and there 
 I'm glad to know I'll be with You 
 But sad for those I'll leave here 
 Turn it around one more time 
 Turn the world 'round, let it spin 
 I've got a few friends who still don't know 
 What You've done for them 
 Turn it around until they see 
 Give them more time to understand 
 One more time, Lord, like You did for me 
 Turn it around again 
 Turn the world 'round, Lord 
 Turn it around 
 The morning paper is reading 
 Just like prophecy 
 And every day, Lord, I'm feeling 
 More and more urgency 
 My friends may think that I'm foolish 
 But that's okay, I don't mind 
 I'd rather them think I'm crazy 
 Than to leave them here behind 
 Turn it around one more time 
 Turn the world 'round, let it spin 
 I've got a few friends who still don't know 
 What You've done for them 
 Turn it around until they see 
 Give them more time to understand 
 One more time, Lord, like You did for me 
 Turn it around again 
 Turn the world 'round, Lord 
 Turn it around 
 Lord, I want to be with You 
 I long to see Your face 
 I just want time to persuade them 
 Words to say 
 (Turn it around, turn it around) 
 Show them the way 
 (Turn it around, turn it around) 
 Turn it around one more time 
 Turn the world 'round, let it spin 
 I've got a few friends who still don't know 
 What You've done for them 
 (Turn it around) 
 Turn it around until they see 
 Give them more time to understand 
 One more time, Lord, like You did for me 
 Turn it around again 
 Turn it around one more time 
 Turn the world 'round, let it spin 
 I've got a few friends who still don't know 
 What You've done for them 
 (What You've done for them) 
 So please, turn it around 
 Please, turn it around 
 Give them more time 
 Give them more time 
 Turn it around 
 Won't you turn it 
 Won't you turn it around 
 I might be wrong, but I'm feeling 
 This world is slowing down

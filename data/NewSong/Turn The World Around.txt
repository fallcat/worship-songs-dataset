I'm burning my candle at both ends 
 Trying to light the world I'm living in 
 There's so much to do 
 And just so little time 
 Well, I know my God wants me 
 To be a light of hope and truth 
 If we're to get His message through 
 Then we must rise and shine 
 The world is in a crazy spin 
 It's headed for a fall 
 If we will take God's love to them 
 Then we can change it all 
 We've got to turn the world around 
 With the love that we found 
 Gotta turn the world around 
 We can turn it upside down 
 We can turn the world around 
 With the love that we found 
 With the love that we found 
 We can turn the world 
 I remember oh, so well 
 All my lonely cries for help 
 Deep inside myself 
 I found an empty life 
 Jesus saw my desperate need 
 And with His love reached down for me 
 And I just can't ignore the call to 
 Go and be His light 
 The world is in a crazy spin 
 It's headed for a fall 
 If we will take God's love to them 
 Then we can change it all 
 I will answer heaven's call 
 Surrender all my life to Jesus 
 He's the one who paid the price 
 The sacrifice of love that frees us

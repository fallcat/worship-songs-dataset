A little boy hangs his head and starts to pray 
 His daddy's gone away to who knows where 
 He needs a hand to hold, he needs to hear there's hope 
 He needs someone to tell him that Jesus cares 
 That's why we're here 
 We wear His name 
 The name above all names 
 We wear His name 
 In a world that's lost in hopelessness 
 We've been called to be the light 
 We wear His name 
 A troubled man, he cries, "what have I done? 
 I can't lose my wife and son, Lord, help me please" 
 He needs to know there's hope, someone to share the load 
 Someone to give the love that sets men free 
 Someone like you and me 
 We wear His name 
 The name above all names 
 We wear His name 
 In a world that's lost in hopelessness 
 We've been called to be the light 
 We wear His name 
 When we see those 
 In desperate need 
 How can we pass them by 
 Let's not forget we represent 
 The name of Jesus Christ 
 We wear His name 
 (Oh, we wear His name) 
 The name above all names 
 We wear His name 
 (Oh, we wear His name) 
 In a world that's lost in hopelessness 
 We've been called to be the light 
 (We are the light) 
 We wear His name 
 (Ooh-ooh-ooh...) 
 We wear His name 
 The name above all names 
 We wear His name 
 In a world that's lost in hopelessness 
 We've been called to be the light 
 We wear His name...

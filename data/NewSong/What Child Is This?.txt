What child is this who laid to rest 
 On Mary's lap is sleeping 
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet 
 While shepherds watch are keeping 
 This, this is Christ the King 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
 Haste, haste to bring him praise 
 The Babe, the Son of Mary 
 So bring him incense, gold and myrrh 
 Come peasant king to praise him 
 The king of kings all glory brings 
 Let loving hearth enthrone him 
 Raise, raise the song on high 
 Let praises fill the earth and sky 
 Joy, joy, The Christ is born 
 The Babe, the Son of Mary

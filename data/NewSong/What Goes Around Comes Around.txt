Dig a pit and you will fall in it 
 Roll a stone and be hit with it 
 The seed you plant in time will grow 
 You're gonna reap just what you sow 
 The deeds you do will come back to you again 
 The circle never ends 
 What goes around comes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 Full circle it comes back to you 
 What goes around comes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 It's true in everything that you do 
 The seed you plant is gonna grow 
 What you reap is what you sow 
 What goes around comes around to you 
 Round and round and round it goes 
 Where it stops no one knows 
 Just one thing I know is true 
 Soon it will come back to you 
 Back to you, back to you 
 Freely give, expecting nothing 
 To everyone never judging 
 Then shaken down the blessings will pour 
 All you give and, oh, so much more 
 Secretly, our Father sees our heart 
 The most important part 
 What goes around comes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 Full circle it comes back to you 
 What goes around comes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 It's true in everything that you do 
 The seed you plant is gonna grow 
 What you reap is what you sow 
 What goes around comes around to you 
 Round and round and round it goes 
 Where it stops no one knows 
 Just one thing I know is true 
 Soon it will come back to you 
 Back to you, back to you 
 What goes around comes around 
 What goes around comes around 
 It's true in everything that you do 
 The seed you plant is gonna grow 
 What you reap is what you sow 
 What goes around comes around to you 
 Round and round and round it goes 
 Where it stops no one knows 
 Just one thing I know is true 
 Soon it will come back to you 
 Back to you, back to you

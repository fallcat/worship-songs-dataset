When everything else is gone 
 I've still got You 
 When everything else is wrong 
 You pull me through 
 When everything else is gone 
 I've still got You 
 Whoo... 
 Mm-hmm... 
 In my time of trouble 
 Mm, and in my time of need 
 It makes me wonder, it makes me wonder 
 How I made it without You 
 And seeing how it's been 
 It can be rough to live today 
 And all this time 
 You've been by my side, all the way 
 When everything else is gone 
 I've still got You 
 When everything else is wrong 
 You pull me through 
 When everything else is gone 
 I've still got You 
 In my time of trouble 
 Oh, and in my time of need 
 It makes me wonder 
 How I made it without You 
 When everything else is gone 
 I've still got You 
 When everything else is wrong 
 You pull me through 
 When everything else is gone 
 Jesus, I've got You 
 When everything else is gone 
 Jesus, I've got You 
 You're holding on to me 
 Yeah, and I've got You 
 I've got You

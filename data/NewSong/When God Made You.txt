When God Made You (Duet with Natalie Grant) - Eddie Carswell, Michael O'Brien 
 It's always been a mystery to me 
 How two hearts can come together 
 And love can last forever 
 But now that I have found you, I believe 
 That a miracle has come 
 When God sends the perfect one 
 Now gone are all my questions about why 
 And I've never been so sure of anything in my life 
 Chorus: I wonder what God was thinking 
 When He created you 
 I wonder if He knew everything I would need 
 Because He made all my dreams come true 
 When God made you 
 He must have been thinking about me 
 I promise that wherever you may go 
 Wherever life may lead you 
 With all my heart I'll be there too 
 From this moment on I want you to know 
 I'll let nothing come between us 
 And I will love the ones you love 
 Bridge: He made the sun He made the moon 
 To harmonize in perfect tune 
 One Can't move without the other 
 They just have to be together 
 And that is why I know it's true 
 You're for me and I'm for you 
 'Cause my world just Can't be right 
 Without you in my life 
 Tag chorus: 
 He must have heard every prayer I've been praying 
 Yes He knew everything I would need 
 When God made you 
 When dreams come true 
 When God made you 
 He must have been thinking about me

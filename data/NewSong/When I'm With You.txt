Well, it's a brand new day 
 And already this world's closing in 
 The telephone rings 
 And here I go again 
 Lord, I need You here 
 To bring some rest to my heart 
 I whisper Your name 
 And, Lord, right there You are 
 When I'm with You 
 This world stops turning 
 One look in Your eyes 
 And my heart stops hurting 
 I love the way that You know 
 Just what to do with me 
 When I'm with You 
 We've all had those days 
 When nothing would work out right 
 Those up and down days 
 They turn into sleepless nights 
 When we need You here 
 To bring some rest to our hearts 
 We whisper Your name 
 And, Lord, right here You are 
 When I'm with You 
 This world stops turning 
 One look in Your eyes 
 And my heart stops hurting 
 I love the way that You know 
 Just what to do with me 
 When I'm with You 
 One day the sun and the moon will stop shining 
 And every star is gonna fall from heaven 
 But on that day, I won't be afraid 
 I know You'll be there beside me 
 When I'm with You 
 This world stops turning 
 One look in Your eyes 
 And my heart stops hurting 
 I love the way that You know 
 Just what to do with me 
 When I'm with You 
 This world stops turning 
 One look in Your eyes 
 And my heart stops hurting 
 I love the way that You know 
 Just what to do with me 
 When I'm with You, yeah 
 Oh... 
 When I'm with You 
 When I'm with You

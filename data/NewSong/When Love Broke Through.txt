Like a foolish dreamer, trying to build a highway to the sky, 
 All my hopes would come tumbling down, and I never knew just why, 
 Until today, when You pulled away the clouds that hung like curtains on my eyes, 
 I'd been blind all these wasted years, And I thought I was so wise, 
 But then You took me by surprise 
 Like waking up from the longest dream, how real it seemed, 
 Until Your love broke through 
 I'd been lost in a fantasy, that blinded me, 
 Until Your love broke through 
 All my life I've been searching for that crazy missing part, 
 And with one touch, You just rolled away the stone that held my heart, 
 And now I see, the answer was as easy as just asking you in, 
 And I am so sure I could never doubt Your gentle touch again, 
 It's like the power of the wind

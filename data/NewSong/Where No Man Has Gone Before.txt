No more days slipping through my hands 
 No more wasted nights 
 I've come too far to deny my heart 
 This dream I hold inside 
 I want to know the depth of God's love 
 'Til I have it all, I won't have enough 
 No matter how deep, I'm jumping in it 
 Whatever the cost, I'm gonna give it 
 Oh, I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before 
 I want to go where I can love Him 
 More and more and more 
 My heart is sure 
 My course complete 
 I'm setting out for a new frontier 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before 
 I have heard about the faithfulness 
 Of the saints of old 
 But I need to know for myself 
 How far my heart can go 
 Well, I'm reaching out where no man can see 
 On faith I'm exploring all God has for me 
 Wherever He leads I'm walking in it 
 I'm going beyond all of the limits 
 Oh, I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before 
 Oh, I want to go where I can love Him 
 More and more and more 
 My heart is sure 
 My course complete 
 I'm setting out for a new frontier 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone... 
 I'm pressing on into uncharted lands 
 I want every treasure He holds in His hands 
 I'll reach for the stars, I'll go to extremes 
 I'll live my whole life in pursuit of this dream 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before 
 I want to go where I can love Him 
 More and more and more 
 My heart is sure 
 My course complete 
 I'm setting out for a new frontier 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before 
 Hey, I want to go where I can love Him 
 More and more and more, oh 
 My heart is sure 
 My course complete 
 I'm setting out for a new frontier 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before, ooh... 
 I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before, ooh, yeah 
 Hey, I want to go 
 Where no man's gone before...

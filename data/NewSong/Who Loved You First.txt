Woman, woman I've been there 
 Every day back to the same old world 
 You dig so deep but not deep enough 
 You break your back just to fill your cup 
 But it's never enough 
 Fill up your hands with healing water 
 Give up your past, be lost no longer now 
 Raise up your flag, lay your guard down, He'll 
 Shatter the wall that has surrounded you 
 You know you'd never have to thirst 
 Surrender to the One 
 Who loved you first 
 Brother, brother have no fear 
 The Father welcomes back your guilty tears 
 Oh, you wrapped yourself in your prodigal shame 
 Return to Him, He's wipe it all away 
 And be free from pain 
 Fill up your hands with healing water 
 Give up your past, be lost no longer now 
 Raise up your flag, lay your guard down, He'll 
 Shatter the wall that has surrounded you 
 You know you'd never have to thirst 
 Surrender to the One 
 Who loved you first 
 Before the world was made 
 Right before time and space 
 He thought of everything 
 He loves us, He loves us 
 You're out there on your own 
 The Father's waiting for you, come back 
 Fill up your hands with healing water 
 Give up your past, be lost no longer now 
 Raise up your flag, lay your guard down, He'll 
 Shatter the wall that has surrounded you, oh 
 Fill up your hands with healing water 
 Give up your past, be lost no longer now 
 Raise up your flag, lay your guard down, He'll 
 Shatter the wall that has surrounded you 
 You know you never have to thirst 
 Surrender to the One 
 Who loved you first 
 The One who loved you first 
 The One who loved you first

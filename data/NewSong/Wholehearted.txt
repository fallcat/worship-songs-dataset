Trying to live in two worlds at one time 
 Holdin' on to all the things that I call mine 
 Sayin' one thing, but really livin' two 
 It's not just hard, it's impossible to do 
 Lord, I want You to know 
 That this double life is through 
 And everything, all of me 
 I'm giving to You 
 And with my whole heart 
 I'm gonna love You 
 And with my whole life 
 I'm gonna live it for You 
 Take my heart, every secret part 
 I'm wholehearted in love with You 
 Talk about peace and talk about real joy 
 I'm talking about things I've never talked about before 
 Two roads to go, but only one road for me 
 I've seen both sides and I'm as sure as I can be 
 But, Lord, I want You to know 
 That this double life is through 
 And everything, all of me 
 I'm giving to You 
 And with my whole heart 
 I'm gonna love You 
 And with my whole life 
 I'm gonna live it for You 
 Take my heart, every secret part 
 I'm wholehearted in love with You 
 I'm not divided in my heart anymore 
 ('Cause I know it's You) 
 I said, it's You and only You that I'm living for 
 (Only with my whole heart) 
 And with my whole heart 
 (Gonna love You) 
 With my whole heart 
 I'm gonna love You 
 And with my whole life 
 You know, I'm gonna live all it for You 
 Take my heart, every secret part 
 I'm wholehearted in love with You 
 With my whole heart 
 You know, I'm gonna love You 
 And with my whole life 
 I'm gonna live it all for You 
 Jesus, take my heart, every secret part 
 I'm wholehearted in love 
 Wholehearted in love 
 I'm in love with You, Lord... 
 You know, I'm gonna live it all for You, Jesus 
 Take my heart, take my soul 
 Wholehearted in love...

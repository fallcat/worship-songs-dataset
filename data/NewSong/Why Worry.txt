Baby I see this world has made you sad 
 Some people can be bad 
 The things they do, the things they say 
 But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears 
 I'll chase away those restless fears 
 That turn your blue skies into grey 
 Why worry, there should be laughter after pain 
 There should be sunshine after rain 
 These things have always been the same 
 So why worry now 
 Baby when I get down I turn to you 
 And you make sense of what I do 
 I know it isn't hard to say 
 But baby just when this world seems mean and cold

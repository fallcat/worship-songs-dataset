Heaven's gates were closed 
 And there seemed to be no hope 
 For fallen man 
 We were prisoners of our sin 
 With no way to enter in 
 But God had a plan 
 The Father knew there had to be 
 A perfect sacrifice 
 So Jesus came, a cross was raised 
 And when He laid down His life 
 Wide open, wide open 
 They nailed His arms wide open 
 After three days in a cold grave 
 The power of sin was broken 
 Now with outstretched arms 
 He welcomes in 
 Everyone who trusts in Him 
 His nail-scarred hands hold heaven's gates wide open 
 For so long my eyes were closed 
 I couldn't see a way of hope 
 For someone like me 
 And in my despair I cried 
 There's got to be more to this life 
 Lord help me please 
 And the Father said 
 There had to be a perfect sacrifice 
 That's why Jesus came, a cross was raised 
 And He laid down His life 
 For every weary heart that aches 
 For every dream this world will break 
 There's a promise in its place 
 God has made a way

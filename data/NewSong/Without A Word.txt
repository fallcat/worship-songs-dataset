You keep talking, but he keeps walking away 
 You keep trying, but he keeps denying the faith 
 Again and again, you share Christ with him 
 You've said all your know 
 But you know he's heard nothing you say 
 A quiet spirit speaks to him so loud 
 A gentle answer quickly tears walls down 
 When the you that's within reaches out, touches him 
 He'll turn and he'll run 
 To the One where true love is found 
 Without a word, let him hear you speaking 
 Without a word, let him see Christ living in you 
 Live your life in such a way 
 There's no denying the change he's made 
 Sometimes actions speak louder, without a word 
 Keep on praying 'til he stops saying, no way 
 Keep on reaching 'til he starts seeing the faith 
 Words alone just won't do 
 Heaven's love must come through 
 It's not what you say 
 But the way that you live every day 
 Without a word, let him hear you speaking 
 Without a word, let him see Christ living in you 
 Live your life in such a way 
 There's no denying the change he's made 
 Sometimes actions speak louder, without a word 
 So close are the ones we love 
 So close, but yet so hard to touch 
 We care so much, our love gets in the way 
 Without a word 
 Live your life in such a way 
 There's no denying the change he's made 
 Sometimes actions speak louder, without a word 
 Sometimes actions speak louder, without a word

Oh 
 Just one look into your eyes 
 I can see your heart is aching 
 From the disappointments life has put you through 
 You've tried to run 
 You've tried to hide and live in isolation 
 Saying nothing else will ever get to you 
 Well, Jesus came to free you 
 From the fear inside your heart 
 His love will always find you 
 No matter where you are 
 You can build a wall around your life 
 Go ahead and make it strong and harder 
 It won't stop love, it won't stop love 
 You can close the door behind you 
 You can lock it if you want to 
 But it won't stop love, no it won't stop 
 Won't stop love 
 Now could it be there's someone who 
 Understands the hurt you're feeling 
 One who loves you just the way you are 
 And could it be that all this time 
 He's been right there waiting 
 For you to simply open up your heart 
 His love will never, ever change 
 No matter what you do 
 Nothing in this world 
 Could ever stop His love for you 
 You can build a wall around your life 
 Go ahead and make it strong and harder 
 Won't stop love, it won't stop love 
 (Won't stop love) 
 You can close the door behind you 
 You can lock it if you want to 
 But it won't stop love, it won't stop 
 Won't stop love 
 There's no place where you can go 
 He can find you there 
 He won't stop until His love 
 Finally breaks through 
 You can build a wall around your life 
 Go ahead and make it strong and harder 
 But it won't stop love, it won't stop love 
 (Oh, it won't stop love) 
 You can close the door behind you 
 Even lock it if you want, want to 
 But it won't stop love, but it won't stop love 
 (No, that won't stop love) 
 You can build a wall around your life 
 Go ahead and make it strong and harder 
 But it won't stop love, no, no, no, no 
 You can close the door behind you 
 Even lock it if you want to 
 But it won't stop love, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 But you can build a wall around your life 
 Go ahead and make it strong and make it harder 
 But it won't stop, won't stop, won't, don't, don't, don't, don't stop 
 Close the door

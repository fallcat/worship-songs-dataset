You spread out the skies over empty space 
 Said let there be light 
 Into a dark and formless world Your light 
 Was born 
 You spread out Your ams over empty hearts 
 Said let there be light 
 Into a dark and hopeless world Your Son 
 Was born 
 You made the world and saw that it was good 
 You sent Your only son for You are good 
 What a wonderful Maker 
 What a wonderful Savior 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 And how humble Your love 
 With a strength like no other 
 And the heart of a Father 
 How majestic Your whispers 
 What a wonderful God 
 No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross 
 And we have only heard 
 The faintest whispers of how great You are

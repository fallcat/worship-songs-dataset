Some say You're a lunatic 
 Some say You're not the One 
 Can't help but disagree with it 
 I believe You're God's own Son 
 I'm sure as a man can be 
 Knowing all You saved me from 
 I know first hand the miracle that You've done inside my heart 
 I'll gladly stand and testify just who You are 
 (You're the Wonderful One) 
 Every breath I take I want my life to bring You praise 
 (You're the Wonderful One) 
 I am so amazed by Your never-ending grace 
 (You're the Wonderful One) 
 And nothing in this world could separate me from Your love 
 You're the Wonderful One 
 Well I've seen all the evidence 
 Nothing else I need to know 
 I'm convinced that a world like this 
 Needs to know that there is hope 
 You help me in my helplessness 
 You heal me in my brokenness 
 Tell me how could I forget 
 The wonders of Your love

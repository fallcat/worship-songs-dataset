When I woke up this morning 
 I just had to talk to God 
 And tell Him about some things on my heart 
 And the wonder of all wonders 
 He came right into my room 
 And told me I could have a new start 
 Then suddenly it came to me 
 My eyes were opened up to see 
 What a mighty God You really are 
 Yeah God Yeah God 
 Yeah God Yeah God 
 You alone are worthy to be praised 
 Yeah God Yeah God 
 Yeah God Yeah God 
 How beautiful and awesome are Your ways 
 Yeah God 
 Well I opened up my Bible to the heroes of the Faith 
 And read about how they lived for You 
 How they trusted You with everything 
 No matter what the cost 
 And how every single time You came through 
 Then suddenly it came to me 
 My eyes were opened up to see 
 What a mighty God You really are 
 You're always there waiting for the call 
 Ready to come to our rescue 
 All we have to do is turn our hearts to You

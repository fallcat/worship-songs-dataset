You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch 
 You really are a heel 
 You're as cuddly as a cactus 
 You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch 
 You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel 
 You're a monster, Mr. Grinch 
 Your heart's an empty hole 
 Your brain is full of spiders 
 You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch 
 I wouldn't touch you with a 
 Thirty nine and a half foot pole 
 You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch 
 You're a nasty, wasty skunk 
 Your heart is full of unwashed socks 
 Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch 
 Three words that best describe you 
 Are as follows and I quote, "Stink! Stank! Stunk!" 
 You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch 
 With a nauseous super naus 
 You're a crooked, jerky jocky 
 And you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch 
 You're a three decker sauerkraut 
 And toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce 
 You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch

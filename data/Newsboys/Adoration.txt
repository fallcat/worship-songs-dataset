I'm here with the others 
 Who saw the heavens testify 
 Now I hang back in the shadows 
 I want to come close 
 I want to know 
 She sees me shivering here 
 She smiles and with a nod 
 I walk through the mud and straw 
 To the newborn Son of God 
 Come, let us adore Him 
 He has come down to this barren land 
 Where we live 
 And all I have to give Him 
 Is adoration 
 He raises a wrinkled hand 
 Through the dust and the flies 
 Wrapped in rags like we are 
 And with barely open eyes 
 He takes my finger 
 And He won't let go 
 And He won't let go 
 It's nothing like I knew before 
 And it's all I need to know 
 Come, let us adore Him 
 He has come down to the world we live in 
 And all I have to give Him 
 Is adoration 
 God is with us here 
 Our Immanuel 
 God is with us here 
 Our Immanuel 
 O come let us adore Him 
 O come let us adore Him 
 Jesus, our Immanuel 
 Is with us here and He won't let go

We have walked in the shadows 
 Been through the storms 
 Fought many battles living to learn 
 But all I can feel is Your peace by my side 
 Down in the valleys with death and with fear 
 You have seen my heart broken but still You are near 
 Down in the valleys Your hand wipes my tears 
 You have seen my heart broken 
 But still I'm singing 
 All I can see is love in Your eyes 
 All I can feel is peace by Your side 
 All I can see is love in Your eyes 
 With that I know You're walking by my side 
 You're in my eyes cause all I can see 
 Is love in Your eyes 
 You look as clear 
 As when this journey began 
 My eyes have been opened 
 To love through Your Son 
 I praise You for Him 
 For He has been my guide

We're joining with You God 
 Everything You're doing 
 Your fire is in our hearts 
 Burning for the broken 
 We open wide our arms 
 A refuge for the hurting 
 Your mercy is our song 
 We're joining with You God 
 We're going all the way 
 We're gonna walk by faith 
 Giving You everything, everything, everything 
 We're going all the way 
 Our strength, our victory 
 We can not be shaken 
 A light for all to see 
 Shining in the darkness 
 We can't contain Your love 
 That purchased us our freedom 
 Salvation is our song 
 Our strength, our victory 
 We're holding nothing back 
 Giving You everything, everything 
 We're joining with You God 
 You can do anything, anything

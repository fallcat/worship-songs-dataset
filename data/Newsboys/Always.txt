What were you thinking? 
 I have a right to ask 
 Is there a reason 
 Other than your past? 
 The great pretender 
 Why was I the last 
 To see through your skin? 
 Is there a chance 
 You'll ever change? 
 It's always the same 
 You're always to blame 
 Is there any way around this 
 I can't see 
 You walked out on her 
 You planned to be free 
 I'm trying not to point the finger 
 But it's killing me 
 What were you thinking 
 Were you thinking of me? 
 Did you see what they wrote 
 On the family tree? 
 I know it's over 
 All in the past 
 I need to forgive you 
 If I'm to last 
 Will I ever change? 
 It's always the same 
 You're always to blame 
 Is there any way around this 
 I can't see 
 You walked out on her 
 You planned to be free 
 I'm trying not to point the finger 
 But it's killing me 
 Take these pieces thrown away 
 Put them together from 
 Night 'n' day 
 Washed by the sun 
 Dried by the rain 
 To be my father 
 In my fatherless days

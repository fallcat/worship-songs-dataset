Be still and know he 
 Know he is holy 
 Be still and know he is God 
 We have filled our lives with inventions 
 That have hurried us nowhere fast 
 Now we need to turn our attentions 
 To what will last 
 Be still and know he 
 Know he is holy 
 Be still and know he is God 
 Love him more dearly 
 See him more clearly 
 Be still and know he is God 
 We've been running without a direction 
 We're afraid to get there late 
 What we need is strength 
 Just to kneel down and wait 
 (End) 
 Be still and know he 
 Know he is holy 
 Be still and know he is God 
 Love him more dearly 
 See him more clearly 
 Be still and know he is God 
 He is God

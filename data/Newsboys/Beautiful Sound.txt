Turn the page 
 Can't turn the light out 
 Every word every line 
 Carries to my soul 
 Dark letters on a page 
 Singing so loud 
 Where did I go wrong not to hear You... 
 Eighteen years 
 I guess it was alright 
 I let You do the thinking 
 I'd just bide my time 
 Father to son 
 Sunday hand me down 
 Where did I go wrong 
 Not to hear Your song 
 It's a beautiful sound 
 Movin' through the crowd 
 Voices lifted up 
 On high for You 
 It's a beautiful song 
 We've only just begun to understand 
 Rediscovering You 
 To have found You 
 And still be looking for You 
 It's the soul's "paradox of love" 
 You fill my cup 
 I lift it up for more 
 I won't stop now that I'm free 
 I'll be chasing You 
 Like You chase me 
 It's a beautiful sound 
 Movin' through the crowd 
 Voices lifted up 
 On high for You 
 It's a beautiful song 
 We've only just begun to understand 
 Rediscovering You 
 Oh, something's so beautiful here 
 It's a beautiful sound 
 Movin' through the crowd 
 Voices lifted up 
 On high for You 
 It's a beautiful song 
 We've only just begun to understand 
 Rediscovering You 
 It's a beautiful sound 
 Movin' through the crowd 
 Voices lifted up 
 On high for You 
 It's a beautiful song 
 We've only just begun to understand 
 Rediscovering You 
 It's a beautiful sound 
 Movin' through the crowd 
 Voices lifted up 
 On high for You 
 It's a beautiful song 
 We've only just begun to understand 
 Rediscovering You 
 Something tells me it's alright 
 You know it's gonna be alright

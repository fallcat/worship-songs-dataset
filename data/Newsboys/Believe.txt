As I lay me down 
 Where do I begin 
 So simply complicated 
 The voice within 
 I hear it singing so clear 
 Invisible like the sound of the wind 
 We all know You are here 
 I just believe, I just believe it 
 And sometimes I dunno why 
 I gotta go with my gut again on this one 
 Not just a feeling 
 It's the reason 
 We know a line is crooked 
 'Cause we know what's straight 
 That little voice inside 
 As I lay me down 
 I confess 
 I'm a fool for You 
 No more, no less 
 And in this world turning gray 
 Strikes a chord when I say 
 There is black 
 There is white 
 There is wrong 
 And there is right 
 I just believe, I just believe it 
 And sometimes I dunno why 
 I gotta go with my gut again on this one 
 Not just a feeling 
 It's the reason 
 We know a line is crooked 
 'Cause we know what's straight 
 That little voice inside 
 There is no alibi 
 If it's not the truth it's 
 Falling for the truth again 
 Not by the wisdom of a man or a machine 
 This is not preference or 
 A taste that disagrees 
 The evidence of things unseen 
 The more you look 
 The more you'll see 
 I just believe, I just believe it 
 And sometimes I dunno why 
 I gotta go with my gut again on this one 
 Not just a feeling 
 It's the reason 
 We know a line is crooked 
 'Cause we know what's straight 
 That little voice inside 
 I just believe, I just believe it 
 And sometimes I dunno why 
 I gotta go with my gut again on this one 
 Not just a feeling 
 It's the reason 
 If there's ever been a time it's now 
 I hear that still small voice inside 
 I just believe, I just believe it 
 And sometimes I dunno why 
 I gotta go with my gut again on this one 
 I just believe, I just believe it

Blessed be Your name 
 In the land that is plentiful 
 Where your streams of abundance flow 
 Blessed be Your name 
 And blessed be Your name 
 When I'm found in the desert place 
 Though I walk through the wilderness 
 Blessed be Your name 
 Every blessing You pour out 
 I'll turn back to praise 
 When the darkness closes in, Lord 
 Still I will say 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be Your name 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be Your glorious name 
 And blessed be Your name 
 When the sun's shining down on me 
 When the world's 'all as it should be' 
 Blessed be Your name 
 And blessed be Your name 
 On the road marked with suffering 
 Though there's pain in the offering 
 Blessed be Your name 
 Every blessing You pour out 
 I'll turn back to praise 
 When the darkness closes in, Lord 
 Still I will say 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be Your name 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be Your glorious name 
 You give and take away 
 You give and take away 
 My heart will choose to say 
 Lord blessed be Your name 
 I will bless Your name, Lord 
 (Rebecca only) 
 Every blessing You pour out 
 I'll turn back to praise 
 When the darkness closes in, Lord 
 Still I will say 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be Your name 
 Blessed be the name of the Lord 
 Blessed be Your glorious name 
 Oh, You give and take away 
 You give and take away 
 But my heart will choose to say (oh Lord!) 
 Blessed be Your name 
 You give and take away 
 You give and take away 
 But my heart will choose to say (oh Lord!) 
 Blessed be Your name 
 Bless... 
 Bless Your name 
 Bless Your name 
 Bless...

I found myself looking into the mirror 
 Knew I wasn't who I wanted to be 
 I was living life the way that I wanted 
 But my eyes reminded me I'm not free 
 Believed a lie so everything that I know 
 Says I gotta go, tired of going solo 
 But I'm never gonna go there again 
 This is what it is, this is who I am 
 This is where I finally take my stand 
 I didn't wanna fall but I don't have to crawl 
 I met the one with two scarred hands 
 Giving Him the best of 
 Everything that's left of 
 The life inside this man 
 I've been born again 
 I see ya walking like you're living in fear 
 Having trouble even looking at me 
 Wishing they would give you more than words 
 Sick of people telling how it should be 
 What'd ya download? Where'd ya get your info? 
 You saw that I'm sure, now you're in the in though 
 Gonna tell you what I believe 
 This is what it is, this is who I am 
 This is where I finally take my stand 
 I didn't wanna fall but I don't have to crawl 
 I met the one with two scarred hands 
 Giving Him the best of 
 Everything that's left of 
 The life inside this man 
 I've been born again 
 We are the ones they call by name 
 I'm never gonna look back 
 Let go, let go, the guilt, the shame 
 Said, I'm never gonna look back 
 This is who I am 
 This is what it is, this is who I am 
 This is where I finally take my stand 
 I didn't wanna fall but I don't have to crawl 
 I met the one with two scarred hands 
 Giving Him the best of 
 Everything that's left of 
 The life inside this man 
 I've been born again 
 This is who I am 
 I didn't wanna fall but I don't have to crawl 
 I met the one with two scarred hands 
 Giving Him the best of 
 Everything that's left of 
 The life inside this man 
 I've been born again 
 I've been born again

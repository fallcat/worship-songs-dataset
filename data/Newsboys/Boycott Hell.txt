We've gotta job to do. 
 We're runnin' out of time to do it. 
 You've got a gift to use. 
 Get out in the world and use it. 
 Bury your foolish pride. 
 We've gotta unionize. 
 Boy, don't you think it's time 
 To boycott hell? 
 Boycott hell. 
 We've got the strength to win 
 Standing arm in arm together. 
 Forget our differences, 
 We can change the world forever. 
 Bury your foolish pride. 
 We've gotta unionize. 
 Boy, don't you think it's 
 Time to boycott hell? 
 Don't let a neighbor go, 
 Form a holy picket line. 
 We've gotta let them know. 
 Don't you think it's time 
 To boycott hell. 
 Rap by Steve Taylor: 
 Guess who comin' through 
 With a little disclaimer. 
 Tune's OK but the words 
 Are gettin' lamer. 
 Ain't no saint can legitimitize. 
 Rhymin' "pride" with "time" with "unionize". 
 See I agree we oughta boycott hell. 
 But we oughta boycott 
 Dumb lyrics as well. 
 Don't let a neighbor go, 
 Form a holy picket line. 
 We've gotta let them know. 
 Don't you think it's time 
 To boycott hell. 
 We've got a job to do. 
 We're running out of time to do it. 
 You've got a gift to use. 
 Get out in the world and use it. 
 Bury your foolish pride. 
 We've gotta unionize. 
 Boy, don't you think it's time 
 To boycott hell. 
 Boycott hell.

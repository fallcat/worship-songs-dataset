 But my fear is it's too late 
 Won't go making no trouble

 From all of those things I used to say 
 All of those plans I had

 The closer I get to You I see 
 Soul's full of hurt, full of need 
 The closer I get I see

 Let my heart be broken by Your heart ache 
 And I feel like I could break

 'Cause all of those times I ran away 
 From all of those things I used to say 
 And all of those pains I feel 
 Reveal to me 
 And I feel like I could break 
 And I feel like I could break 
 Now, it's more than I can take 
 Let my heart be broken by Your heart ache 
 'Cause I feel like I could break 
 And I feel like I could break 
 Lord, I know it's getting late 
 Let my heart be broken by Your heart ache 
 Don't go think I'm crazy 
 But I feel like

Hold the milk, put back the sugar 
 They are powerless to console 
 We've gathered here to sprinkle ashes 
 From our late friend's cereal bowl. 
 Breakfast Clubbers, say the motto 
 That he taught us to repeat: 
 "You will lose it in your gym class if you wait till noon to eat." 
 Back when the Chess Club, said our eggs were soft 
 Every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft 
 Oh, none of us knew his checkout time would come so soon 
 But before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune: 
 When the toast is burned, 
 And all the milk has turned 
 And Cap'n Crunch is wavin' farewell. 
 When the big one finds you 
 May this song remind you 
 That they don't serve breakfast, in Hell. 
 Breakfast clubbers, drop the hankies 
 Though to some our friend was odd, 
 That day he bought those pine pajamas 
 His check was good with God. 
 Those here without the Lord, 
 How do you cope? 
 For this morning we don't mourn 
 Like those who have no hope. 
 Oh rise up, Fruit Loop lovers- 
 Sing out sweet and low 
 With spoons held high 
 We bid our brother "Cheerio!" 
 Chorus (repeat till fade)

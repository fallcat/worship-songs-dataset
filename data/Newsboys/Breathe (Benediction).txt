When all is said and all has come undone 
 When the sun, the moon and stars grow dark 
 Before the days of youth are left in vain 
 Before the dust reclaims its own again 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe oh Breath of God 
 Breathe on me 
 Till my heart is new 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe oh Breath of Life 
 Breathe on me 
 Till I'm resting in you 
 When all is said and all has come undone 
 Restore the promise I made when I was young 
 Now unto Him who can keep us from falling 
 And present us faultless before His glory 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe oh Breath of God 
 Breathe on me 
 Till my heart is new 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe oh Breath of Life 
 Breathe on me 
 Till I'm resting in you

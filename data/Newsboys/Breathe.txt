Tuesday the third, 
 I'll call this entry "Mistake" 
 Cheap imitation 
 My life feels like a fake 
 A people person, some days people annoy me 
 I'm growin' edgy 
 Wednesday's title "Avoid Me 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe oh breath of God 
 Breathe on me 
 Till my heart is new 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe oh breath of life 
 Breathe on me 
 Till I love like you do 
 Thursday the fifth 
 I title "Drivers Beware" 
 Temperamental and I don't really care 
 I gave till I bled 
 You laughed when I fainted 
 Don't want to live this life 
 Bitter and tainted

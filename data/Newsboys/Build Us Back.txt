We've been crumbled, we've been crushed 
 City walls have turned to dust 
 Broken hands and blistered feet 
 We walk for miles to find relief 
 When the thief takes, when our hopes cave 
 You build us back 
 You build us back 
 When the earth shakes, when the world breaks 
 You build us back 
 You build us back 
 We are scared, we are poor 
 All our safety nets are torn 
 We've been humbled to our knees 
 From these ruins, we believe 
 When the thief takes, when our hopes cave 
 You build us back 
 You build us back 
 When the earth shakes, when the world breaks 
 You build us back 
 You build us back 
 Redeemer, redeem us 
 Restorer, restore us 
 Oh build us back 
 Though the mountains be shaken, the hills be removed 
 Your unfailing love remains 
 After all that's been taken, Your promise, still sacred 
 You build us back with precious stones 
 When the thief takes, when our hopes cave 
 You build us back 
 You build us back 
 When the earth shakes, when the world breaks 
 You build us back 
 You build us back

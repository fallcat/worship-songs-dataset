This is my story, this is my song 
 I have a hope that's stronger then the dust I'm standing on 
 This is my anchor, my cornerstone 
 This is the anthem I'll be singing, till the Kingdom comes 
 I am committed, I'm not ashamed 
 I pledge my allegiance to Jesus, My King 
 I am committed, got nothing to hide 
 I'm not giving up, not selling out, I'm in this for life 
 I am committed, to Christ 
 I am committed, to Christ 
 For all that He's given, The price that He paid 
 Forever we're freed by the power of His unshakable grace 
 For all of His children, His daughters and sons 
 This is the anthem we'll keep singing from the top of our lungs 
 To the One who gave it all 
 To the One who fights for us 
 To the One who took my suffering 
 In the name of love 
 This is our message 
 Our battle cry 
 So stand up and sing with me 
 I am committed

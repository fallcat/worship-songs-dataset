And every generation's got 
 The fearless few who can't be bought 
 They don't take polls or look around 
 They act on truth, and then they stand their ground 
 Come up and see the world stripped bare 
 The free indeed 
 They breathe a rarefied air 
 Yeah, they got spirit 
 Yeah, they got game 
 And some get christened 
 With a righteous sounding name 
 Cor-ne-li-us 
 And every generation knows 
 The doers do, the posers pose 
 'Cause every time the plop goes fizz 
 Another yes-man gets his 
 Come on and see the big man's boss 
 The mind clears out when you're taking up the cross 
 Yeah, his burden's easy 
 No, it don't chafe 
 It's God's safe harbour 
 Why play it safe? 
 Cor-ne-li-us 
 Core-strong like a centurion 
 I wanna be Cornelius 
 Core-strong like a centurion 
 I wanna be Cornelius 
 His kneel is real 
 His kneel is real 
 What rhymes with Cornelius? 
 Helium 
 The "cor" is before a kneel, a kneel 
 The "i" is an "e" in us, in us 
 He's ready to fight, but not to fuss 
 We like, we like Cornelius 
 And history proves the axiom 
 Surface skimmers choke on scum 
 Who's calling deep? 
 Who opens wide? 
 Who put the "just" in "justified"? 
 Check, check it out--the view you get 
 It's God's high-wire 
 There isn't any net 
 Show a little spirit 
 Show you got game 
 Show you know 
 (We know, we know) 
 You know what's in a name 
 Cor-ne-li-us 
 He's ready to fight, 
 But not to fuss 
 We like, we like 
 Cornelius 
 He isn't a wuss 
 He never was 
 We like, we like 
 Cornelius

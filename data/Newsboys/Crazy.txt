You turned the world on its head with Your words 
 Said, "the first would be last and the last would be first" 
 You loved the traitor, those who spat in Your face 
 And You gave up a throne for a cross and a grave 
 Oh, I wanna be that radical 
 Oh, fearless and fanatical 
 Crazy 
 I don't care if the whole world calls me 
 Crazy 
 I don't care if it looks like I've lost my mind 
 I'm alive 
 To live a reckless, righteous, foolish life 
 Maybe 
 I was born to be crazy 
 I was born to be crazy 
 You said the meek would inherit the earth 
 And the wise of the world came to call You absurd 
 You spoke of kingdoms that no eye has seen 
 And proclaimed You're the way to eternity 
 Oh, I wanna be that radical 
 Oh, fearless and fanatical 
 Crazy 
 I don't care if the whole world calls me 
 Crazy 
 I don't care if it looks like I've lost my mind 
 I'm alive 
 To live a reckless, righteous, foolish life 
 Maybe 
 I was born to be crazy 
 I was born to be crazy 
 Some say strange 
 Some say odd 
 I say child of the living God 
 Some say mad 
 Some say wrong 
 I say child of the living God 
 Some say strange 
 Some say odd 
 I say child of the living God 
 Some say mad 
 Some say wrong 
 I say child of the living God 
 Crazy 
 I don't care if the whole world calls me 
 Crazy 
 I don't care if it looks like I've lost my mind 
 I'm alive 
 To live a reckless, righteous, foolish life 
 Maybe 
 I was born to be crazy 
 I was born to be crazy 
 I was born to be crazy 
 I was born to be crazy 
 I was born to be crazy

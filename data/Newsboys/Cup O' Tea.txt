"Kick Start" 
 His overdue life as a star, 
 Waitin' tables hadn't done that so far. 
 "Spotlight" 
 A dream for many a year, 
 The leather jacket, Jimmy's ever ready stage wear. 
 Sorry I'm not your cup o' tea, 
 But I don't mind, 
 Yeah, I said I don't mind. 
 At least I know you're thinking about me. 
 Yeah, I don't mind, 
 Yeah, I said I don't mind. 
 "Good stuff, people don't know when they hear!" 
 Mumbled something 'bout "Pearls in a pig's ear". 
 "Old School", thirty two and knowing it all. 
 Who wants to listen to a single-sided phone call? 
 Bring it all into perspective, 
 The tongue will steer the ship ahoy. 
 Spark up a flame 
 Feel the pain of habanero sauce. 
 A word's forever, 
 When we speak we set 'em free 
 So watch your mouth and you be careful what you say Jimmy. 
 Sorry, I'm not your cup o' tea, 
 But I don't mind, 
 Yeah, I said I don't mind. 
 At least I know you're thinking about me. 
 Yeah, I don't mind, 
 Ah, maybe I do mind.

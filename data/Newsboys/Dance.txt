Never got the memo 
 Never got on board 
 Couldn't get lost 
 'Cause I never explored 
 Never took a swing 
 Never held the ring 
 Never drew a straw 
 Never knew how to draw 
 We got the whole world waiting for 
 Anything to wash ashore 
 Evidence they can't ignore 
 Anything to hope for 
 Faith is the substance 
 Faith is the glue 
 Bringing us together 
 Giving us a clue 
 (It'll make ya) 
 Dance like no one is looking 
 Sing like no one can hear 
 Love like you've never hurt before 
 Live like there's nothing to fear 
 Never got with it 
 Never gave blood 
 Draggin' my feet 
 Tracked in more mud 
 Tried to take control 
 Dug a deeper hole 
 Couldn't get a hand 
 Then bless my soul 
 You hosed off the dirt 
 Set my feet on a rock 
 I got a vision from god 
 I felt the awe and the shock 
 (I know) 
 Faith is the substance 
 Faith is the key 
 Faith is gonna take us 
 Where we're meant to be 
 (Now we're gonna) 
 Dance like no one is looking 
 Sing like no one can hear 
 Love like you've never hurt before 
 Live like there's nothing to fear 
 Get up, get out 
 Get up, get out 
 Get up, get out 
 Get up, get out 
 Come on 
 Dance like no one is looking 
 Sing like no one can hear 
 Love like you've never hurt before 
 Live like there's nothing to fear 
 Dance like no one is looking 
 Sing like no one can hear 
 Love like you've never hurt before 
 Live like there's nothing to fear

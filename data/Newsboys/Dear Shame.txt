I catch you digging in my trash 
 For stuff I've long thrown away. 
 You bring it back on a tray. 
 And I hear you wheezing in the hall 
 Spreading gems and old news. 
 You always love to confuse. 
 I flee the light just to live in your shadow. 
 I'm needing mercy and you offer me blame. 
 Dear Shame: 
 You're oh so eager to toy with me. 
 You're always stealing the joy in me. 
 You love to whisper my name, Dear Shame, Dear Shame. 
 You've got me living like a bug, 
 Crawling in fear. 
 (It's been a very long year.) 
 I dream of growing some wings, 
 I think I'm flying away, 
 Then you point and you spray. 
 All my hidden secrets 
 Crave the light of forgiveness. 
 You pull the shades, 
 You accuse and you blame. 
 I fled the light just to live in your shadow. 
 I needed mercy, and you offered me blame. 
 Dear Shame: 
 I think I'm wise to your strategy. 
 I won't be needing your company. 
 My name's eternally clear, 
 Dear Shame, 
 Dear Shame.

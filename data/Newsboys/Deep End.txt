She's diving down 
 Gonna make her home now 
 The ocean 
 She's done with living her life on the ground 
 She's sinking down 
 Hands above her 
 Held her 
 Nineteen years, and now they're letting go 
 Tomorrow will be 'round 
 And everyone will see 
 No tragedy 
 It's like it's over, but it's just begun 
 She's going off the deep end 
 Breaking from the crowd 
 She's way in over her head 
 I think she's gonna drown 
 She's going off the deep end 
 The search is over now 
 She's falling into your hands 
 It's all or nothing 
 There's no guessing, she's been lost and found 
 She's diving down 
 Scars on her elbows 
 The wind blows 
 An old song spins around inside 
 "How sweet the sound" 
 To be living and dying 
 Looks like it's over, but it's just begun 
 She's going off the deep end 
 Breaking from the crowd 
 She's way in over her head 
 I think she's gonna drown 
 She's going off the deep end 
 The search is over now 
 She's falling into your hands 
 It's all or nothing 
 There's no guessing, she's been lost and found 
 To take this step of faith 
 Don't need to be scared 
 Turn worry into wonder 
 Dissolve the fear 
 She's steppin' out 
 And you drop the blame 
 As she speaks the name above all other names 
 To be lost and found 
 Her world has turned upside down 
 Her soul restored with salt like rain 
 From all of the things that you forgave 
 And all the times she's disobeyed 
 She's diving in the ocean of your grace

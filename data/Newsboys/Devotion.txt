All my world 
 All I've lost 
 The wrecks I've made here 
 The lives it cost 
 Your hand restores 
 Your works make whole 
 With all my soul 
 I thank You 
 I owe You 
 All my: 
 Devotion 
 All that I have to give 
 Here's my devotion 
 You're all that it means to live 
 All my past 
 My tainted main 
 You stole its legacy 
 Of pride and shame 
 You're all I love 
 You're all I fear 
 I'm drawing near 
 To face You 
 To know You 
 To show You: 
 Devotion 
 All that I have to give 
 Here's my devotion 
 You're all that it means to live 
 You found me 
 In a shallow grave 
 You tracked me out from beneath it all 
 You healed me 
 Saved me 
 In the nick of time 
 Your perfect time 
 You found me (found me) 
 In a shallow grave (in a shallow grave) 
 You called me out from beneath it all 
 You touched me (touched me) 
 Saved me (saved me) 
 In the nick of time 
 In Your perfect time 
 I devote all I have to You 
 I devote all that You've made new 
 All You restored that day You bled 
 All that You brought back from the dead 
 All: 
 Devotion (You're all...) 
 You're all that I have to give 
 You're all that it means to live 
 Here's my devotion, my devotion 
 All that it means to live (You're all that means to live) 
 My Lord 
 My devotion

Ah ah ah ah 
 (Yeah!) 
 I thought that I could fix it on my own 
 The sickness deep in my heart 
 I thought that I could find the healing deep inside of me 
 Underneath all these scars 
 I had to fall, had to fall apart, to find that You- 
 Love me even after 
 I am a disaster 
 And everything is shattered 
 On the floor 
 You pick me up and hold me 
 God, You are the only 
 Remedy my heart's been lookin' for 
 You're the cure 
 Ah ah ah ah 
 I had my kingdom here, I had my thrown 
 Had everything I could need (Oh oh!) 
 I put my world on empty promises, empty things 
 It ripped apart at the seams (Oh oh!) 
 I had to crash, had to crash and burn, to find that You- 
 Love me even after 
 I am a disaster 
 And everything is shattered 
 On the floor 
 You pick me up and hold me 
 God, You are the only 
 Remedy my heart's been lookin' for 
 You're the cure, the cure, the cure, You're the cure 
 You're the cure, the cure, the cure, You're the cure 
 Since the day that I was born 
 I was broken and torn 
 So human, so incomplete 
 But You never gave up 
 Never lessened Your love 
 That's the way that You'll always be 
 I had to fall apart to find You, 
 Love me even after I am a disaster 
 And everything is shattered 
 On the floor 
 You pick me up and hold me 
 God, You are the only 
 Remedy my heart's been lookin' for 
 You're the cure, the cure, the cure, You're the cure 
 You're the cure, the cure, the cure, You're the cure 
 You're the cure! 
 (I thought that I could fix it on my own) 
 You're the cure!

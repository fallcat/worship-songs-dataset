Time after time 
 It's all the same 
 I forget who I am 
 I take Your place 
 The bigger I get 
 The harder I fall 
 I act like I don't need You at all 
 And one by one 
 My bridges burn 
 Until I've nowhere left to turn 
 But it's You who's right there for me 
 And it's You who writes my story 
 I need an earthquake 
 To shake me until it breaks me down 
 I'm giving You everything 
 My pride's crashing to the ground 
 Shatter my walls 
 Let my kingdom fall 
 I don't wanna wear this crown no more 
 My heart is Yours to take 
 It's You that can save me 
 It's You that can shake me 
 I need an earthquake 
 I need an earthquake 
 I've lived on the edge 
 For way too long 
 Walking a tightrope on my own 
 When out of the dark 
 I heard You call 
 Now, into Your hands I surrender all 
 So take my heart and shape it up 
 To build me into what You want 
 'Cause it's You who sees right through me 
 You're the only one that moves me 
 I lift my hands 
 I lift my hands high 
 My heart is open 
 My heart is open wide 
 Show me life 
 Show me a new life 
 Where all that's left 
 Where all that's left is You and I

Thumbs out on a desert road I am told 
 Leads to nowhere 
 Any shade is as good as the next 
 If your shadow doesn't go there 
 Week seven: Did you really assume 
 I'd find some solace from the letter in your room? 
 Next life, could you kindly refain 
 From throwing yourself at the mercy of a train? 
 Silence all, nobody breathe. 
 How in the world could you just leave? 
 You promised you would 
 Silence that evil with good 
 Hear me out, I have the floor 
 I'll give you my tears, I'll listen more 
 You promised you would 
 Overcome evil with good 
 Maybe this world is a barren place for a soul 
 Prone to get lost 
 But heaven still hounds from the smallest sounds 
 To the cries of the storm-tossed 
 Week nine: I am writing in the sand 
 Any little clue that could help me understand 
 Every whispered secret, every muffled sigh 
 Every half-truth that was added to a lie 
 Silence all, nobody move 
 I've got to know now what you hoped to prove 
 You promised you would 
 Silence that evil with good 
 Shame feeds guilt, guilt needs release 
 You took it to God 
 You made your peace 
 And swore that you would 
 Overcome evil with good 
 Every old demon playing back the crime 
 If they needed blood, I'd have gladly given mine 
 A Child of the Kingdom; still an invalid 
 Forgive her, please Father 
 She don't know what she did 
 Silence all, now go to sleep 
 The water's free, the well is deep 
 How can we return 
 That which we never could earn? 
 God, I long to see her face 
 We haven't a hope 
 Beyond Your grace 
 I know that You will 
 Overcome evil 
 For good

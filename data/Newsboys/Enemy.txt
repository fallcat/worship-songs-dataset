Used to think You didn't care, 
 I, was just a pawn in the game You were playin' 
 Puttin' walls up everywhere 
 Never thought You heard a word I was prayin' 
 I stood in the way 
 When I needed to run to You 
 But I was too proud to say 
 Take away the blindness 
 Lead me through the dark 
 Don't let me fall apart 
 Save me from my bitterness 
 Show me who I am 
 Make me who You want me to be 
 I know I pushed You away 
 Lookin' for someone to blame, yeah 
 Now I can see, I've been my own worst enemy 
 Who was I to sit and judge? 
 Always pointing my crooked finger 
 Holding tight onto a grudge 
 All along I was a chief of sinners 
 I stood in the way 
 When I needed to run to You 
 Lord, I was too proud to say 
 Take away the blindness 
 Lead me through the dark 
 Don't let me fall apart 
 Save me from my bitterness 
 Show me who I am 
 Make me who You want me to be 
 I know I pushed You away 
 Lookin' for someone to blame, yeah 
 Now I can see, I've been my own worst enemy 
 No You never gave up on me! 
 No You never gave up on me! 
 No You never gave up on me! 
 Take away the blindness 
 Lead me through the dark 
 Don't let me fall apart 
 Save me from my bitterness 
 Show me who I am 
 Make me who You want me to be 
 I know I pushed You away 
 Lookin' for someone to blame, yeah 
 Now I can see, I've been my own worst enemy 
 Oh oh! 
 Now I can see, I've been my own worst enemy 
 Oh, oh! 
 Now I can see, I've been my own worst enemy 
 No You never gave up on me! 
 No You never gave up on me! 
 No You never gave up on me!

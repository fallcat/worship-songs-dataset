One to another 
 Do you remember me? 
 I feel so small 
 Well are you listenin' tonight 
 So temporary 
 The things that I have seen 
 I ran so far 
 Will you take me back again 
 Entertaining angels 
 By the light of my TV screen 
 24-7 you wait for me 
 Entertaining angels 
 By the time I fall to my knees 
 Hosts of heaven, sing over me 
 One to another 
 The feelings in between 
 I won't let go 
 Of all you taught me - alright 
 Close as a brother 
 The way we used to be 
 I'll hold my breath 
 And I'll wait for you to breath 
 Entertaining angels 
 By the light of my TV screen 
 24-7 you wait for me 
 Entertaining angels 
 While the night becomes history 
 Hosts of heaven, sing over me 
 Entertaining angels 
 By the light of my TV screen 
 24-7 you wait for me 
 Entertaining angels 
 By the time I fall to my knees 
 Hosts of heaven, sing over me 
 Entertaining angels 
 By the light of my TV screen 
 24-7 you wait for me 
 Entertaining angels 
 While the night becomes history 
 Hosts of heaven, sing over me

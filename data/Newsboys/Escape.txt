Don't believe the hype 
 You're being tempted by the same ol' 
 You say it's under control 
 Just remind me how you see so clearly 
 Face down in a hole 
 Press toward the light 
 And the light will ground you 
 Go with the flow 
 And the flow will drown you 
 Hey now, there's always an out 
 But if you get up, get up, get up 
 You can breakaway 
 And if you get out, get out, get out 
 Nothing can overtake 
 Don't wait, escape 
 We get beaten by the same sticks 
 Until we start to crack 
 We get deceived by the same tricks 
 That's why the devil's bringing 'em back 
 (He's bringing 'em back) 
 Don't believe the hype 
 It's such a letdown 
 But if you get up, get up, get up 
 You can breakaway 
 And if you get out, get out, get out 
 Nothing can overtake 
 Don't wait, escape

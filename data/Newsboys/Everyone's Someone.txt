Find yourself 
 Ya' darkest enemy 
 You've given up 
 On what you thought you'd be 
 Your plans were made 
 Nothing's really changed 
 Be planning on one thing 
 You're loved just the same 
 When it all comes 'round 
 Everyone's someone 
 When it all comes 'round 
 Everyone's someone 
 Kinda look old 
 Like a man with everything 
 Give it all for something real 
 No, you can't take it with you 
 Nothing's forged, nothing's new 
 Do I imagine being you 
 Maker of the rain 
 Lets it fall the same on me and you 
 No matter who you are 
 No matter where you run 
 No matter what you do 
 What you're going through 
 (Oh, oh, oh) 
 Everone's someone 
 (Oh, oh, oh) 
 (No matter what you do) 
 (What you're going through) 
 Everone's someone 
 (Oh, oh, oh) 
 (No matter what you do) 
 (What you're going through) 
 Everone's someone 
 (Oh, oh, oh) 
 Everone's someone

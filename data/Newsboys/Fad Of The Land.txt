Got my genome mapping 
 Got my genome mapping 
 Caught my smart dog napping 
 Got my genome mapping 
 I'm a marinade 
 Of what's hot this summer 
 I'm an early comer 
 Bought a Gulf War Hummer 
 Every fad I feel its force 
 Every trend I do endorse 
 Got my genome mapping 
 Caught my smart dog napping 
 I'm charging up the new, new thing 
 I'm answering a customized ring 
 I'm starting from the place you stop 
 I'm packing for an ego trip, hop 
 Stop the scam 
 You day traders in a traffic jam 
 Can the craze 
 All you playas outta plays 
 Fight the man 
 All you suckers for a better brand 
 They got us living on the fad of the land 
 Get your pager on 
 'Cause you know my number 
 I'm a wireless wonder 
 Got thumbs of thunder 
 Soul daddies in a fire wire tumble dryer 
 Soul mamas broke the breaker 
 Soul children packin' Prozac pacifiers 
 Get your plug-in 
 We all need to plug in to our maker

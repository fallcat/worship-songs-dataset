Seen it all 
 Heard the talk 
 Heart unturned 
 Watch you leaving 
 Some things have to fall on you 
 Some things have to fall on you 
 I lift you up 
 Pray for grace 
 Love you more 
 Still you run away and 
 Some things have to fall on you 
 Sometimes like a wall on you 
 What makes a man aware of his need? 
 (What makes a man aware of his need?) 
 Is it by faith, by words or by deed? 
 (Is it by faith, by words or by deed?) 
 For your heart to be broken, to truly be sent home 
 (For your heart to be broken) 
 Some things have to fall on you 
 Spirit saves 
 Letter kills 
 Plant the seed 
 I'll be waiting 
 Some things have to fall on you 
 Spirit has to fall, it's true

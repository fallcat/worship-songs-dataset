I know ya thinking... you're the only one 
 I see you hiding out 'cause of what you've done 
 All your shame got you on the run 
 I been there, too, and it just ain't fun 
 This is a message to the saints 
 The table has been set, so take your place 
 There is no more condemnation 
 There is only grace 
 We are family here 
 Colors and stains disappear 
 There is no doubt you belong 
 This is the family of God 
 No matter who you were when you walked through the door 
 Here you're no orphan anymore 
 Brothers and sisters by blood 
 This is the Family of God 
 Oh, we are 
 Sons and daughters of the King 
 We are 
 We are the royal family 
 Hey drifter, you can come on home 
 You're no stranger, yeah, you are known 
 Heavy burdens, leave 'em at the door 
 'Cause this is our Father's world 
 For this is our Father's world 
 This is a message to the saints 
 The table has been set, so take your place 
 There is no more condemnation 
 There is only grace 
 So, child of God 
 Your adoption, it is done 
 This family is forever 
 And we've just begun

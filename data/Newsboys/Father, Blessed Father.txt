Will you take what we have 
 A sacrifice unto You 
 And create clean hearts 
 And, Lord, make our spirits new 
 Father, blessed Father 
 Lead and guide us for Your name's sake 
 And keep us in the shelter of Your presence 
 Till we see Your face 
 Let us hear what You say 
 Let us know Your voice and all of Your ways 
 Take our hands, lead us home 
 To the refuge that we find in You alone 
 All adoration 
 To our Lord Redeemer 
 To our Shepard 
 Who carries us forevermore 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe, oh, breath of God 
 Breathe on me 
 Till my heart is new 
 Oh Lord, oh Lord 
 Till my heart is new 
 Breathe on me 
 Breathe, oh, breath of life 
 Breathe on me 
 Till my heart is new 
 Oh Lord, oh Lord 
 Till my heart is new

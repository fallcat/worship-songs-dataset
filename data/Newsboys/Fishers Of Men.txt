Seven billion people on a spinning ball 
 And they all mean the world to You 
 It's time like these that I feel so small 
 There must be somethin' I can do 
 I played it safe in shallow water 
 Never had the faith to cross the border 
 God, I've gotten good at being comfortable 
 It's time to leave my comfort zone 
 Cause You said Go! Go! 
 I will make you fishers of men 
 Go! Go! 
 I don't care who or where ya been 
 So don't 'cha be afraid 
 To show the world your faith 
 Cause your never alone 
 Just Go! Go! 
 I will make you fishers of men 
 And if this life is like a candle 
 That You gave us to burn 
 God we wanna light up the night 
 Instead of livin' with doubt 
 We should be livin' it out 
 So let Your love be magnified! 
 Follow me, yeah 
 Follow me-e-e 
 This is the mission 
 Should you accept it 
 Your invitation 
 To get connected 
 Get connected 
 Get connected 
 I will make you! 
 (Fishers of men!) 
 Seven billion people on a spinning ball

 Cause your never alone

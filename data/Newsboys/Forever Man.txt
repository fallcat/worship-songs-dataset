I wanna go higher, higher, set it free 
 There's gotta be more to touch than what I see 
 There's a reason we must be 
 For the love of God, speak it to me 
 Good news for the modern man (yes, it is) 
 Made by the creator's hands (yeah, he is) 
 Confirmed just who I am 
 Here I stand, the forever man 
 It's gotta be higher, higher, let it be 
 Carry on from this life's brevity 
 When this mortal coil is twisting 
 With the love of mercy, carry me 
 Sometimes we lose our sight 
 Open our eyes 
 No secret here 
 Heaven is near 
 And the longer I live 
 The stronger I feel a creator put us here 
 And the day will come, gravity will run 
 And we'll meet you in the air 
 Where face to face we will wonder 
 As the mysteries come undone 
 And at the end of all our travels 
 We find our journey's just begun 
 Here I stand 
 It's who I am 
 Here I stand 
 Forever man

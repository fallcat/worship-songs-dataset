You are good, You are good 
 When there's nothing good in me 
 You are love, You are love 
 On display for all to see 
 You are light, You are light 
 When the darkness closes in 
 You are hope, You are hope 
 You have covered all my sin 
 You are peace, You are peace 
 When my fear is crippling 
 You are true, You are true 
 Even in my wandering 
 You are joy, You are joy 
 You're the reason that I sing 
 You are life, You are life 
 In You death has lost its sting 
 I'm running to Your arms 
 I'm running to Your arms 
 The riches of Your love 
 Will always be enough 
 Nothing compares 
 To Your embrace 
 Light of the world 
 Forever reign 
 You are more, You are more 
 Than my words will ever say 
 You are Lord, You are Lord 
 All creation will proclaim 
 You are here, You are here 
 In Your presence I'm made whole 
 You are God, You are God 
 Of all else I'm letting go 
 My heart will sing 
 No other name 
 Jesus, Jesus

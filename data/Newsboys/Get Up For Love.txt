Island life in the sun 
 Tryin' to hide from everyone 
 Livin' a life that pleases you 
 Big walls that hide you 
 Where were you those days, Woo 
 When love called, you were away, Woo 
 You know people lost yeah 
 Bring down those walls yeah 
 Its time to make a stand, get up, get up 
 Its time to take the land 
 Get up, get up for love 
 Island life in the sun tryin' to hide from everyone 
 Livin' a life that pleases you, big walls that hide you 
 Friends lost with hell to pay, Woo 
 Will you let them go that way 
 People caught by death yeah, Woo 
 Do you love the lost yeah, Woo 
 The devil comes to rob and to steal 
 Secret believer, believe me it's real

Who are we? 
 You gave us Your son as a man 
 To die for all our freedom 
 And wash our guilty hands 
 With Your blood that's enough to purify man 
 And the love that You gave 
 It makes me stand and say 
 I give me to You, all that I am 
 Your love's enough to change me 
 You are the One that's making me new 
 I wanna be used 
 The cry of my heart is take me 
 Oh, Lord, I give me to You 
 It's such a perfect story 
 You wrote me in Your plan 
 Of beautiful redemption 
 And now I understand 
 That I need You to lead 
 Forgetting my plans 
 So I will live like You saved 
 This prodigal man 
 Oh, Lord 
 I give me to You, all that I am 
 Your love's enough to change me 
 You are the One that's making me new 
 I wanna be used 
 The cry of my heart is take me 
 Oh, Lord, I give me to You 
 I give You my mind 
 I give You my hands 
 I give You my eyes 
 Take all I am 
 I give You my feet 
 They'll go where You lead 
 Take all of me 
 Jesus, take all of me 
 I give me to You, all that I am 
 Your love's enough to change me 
 You are the One that's making me new 
 I wanna be used 
 The cry of my heart is take me 
 Oh, Lord, I give me to You 
 Oh, Lord, I give me to You

I was a teen flat-liner on the joy screen 
 Dead in the water of life as we knew 
 You offered me drink, I wanted more than a sip 
 But I couldn't let go on the straws I was clinging to 
 Giving it over, giving it over 
 I was flat on my back, I'd slid till it hurt 
 Giving it over, giving it over 
 You put my head in the clouds and my feet in good dirt 
 My head in the clouds and my feet in good... dirt 
 Devils were crowding my head with lies they spread 
 They'd convinced me of what fools know isn't true 
 Quick as an Outkast rhyme you took me back in time 
 Back to the first love I ever knew 
 Giving it over, giving it over 
 Got my broken heart healed and removed from its cast 
 Giving it over, giving it over 
 Yeah, I'm giving it all to a true love at last 
 Giving it all to a true love at last 
 You don't know where the wind's going to blow 
 And since you can't take it with you 
 Better give it away before you go 
 Yeah, I'm giving it over 
 Greed is the word, it's a verb 
 Wants to bind us all 
 Bind us together like a platinum truss 
 Giving it over, giving it over 
 I'm putting my heart into treasures that don't rust 
 Giving it over, giving it over 
 I'm giving it all to a face I can trust 
 You don't know where the wind's going to blow 
 And since you can't take it with you 
 Better give it away before you go 
 Yeah, I'm giving it over 
 Giving it over, giving it over, giving it all 
 (Give, give, give, give it over) 
 I'm giving it over, giving it over, giving it all 
 (Give, give, give, give it over)...

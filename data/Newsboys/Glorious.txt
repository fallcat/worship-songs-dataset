And if I sing out in the dark of night 
 Or praise You in the light of dawn 
 Hear my song and lift me on Your wings 
 And if I worship You in solitude 
 Or join a choir 10,000 strong 
 Hear my song till all creation sings 
 Glorious, shining so glorious 
 Though I stumble, though I fall 
 You remain glorious. 
 Towards Your light 
 I come running, I come running 
 Into Your arms 
 I come running, I come running. 
 You have searched me 
 You have known my heart 
 You've heard my every anxious thought 
 Hear my song, it's all I have to bring 
 And though the battles come 
 This much is known: 
 The victory's won by You alone 
 Hear my song, my Savior and my King 
 Singing 
 Every faithless mission 
 Every false ambition 
 Here, I lay them at Your feet 
 As in heaven, as on earth 
 I will ever sing Your worth 
 You alone make me complete 
 Repeat chorus 2 times 
 Towards Your light 
 I come running, I come running 
 Into Your arms 
 I come running, I come running.

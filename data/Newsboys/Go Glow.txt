Glo-o-o-oh-ow, go glo-o-o-oh-ow 
 Are you sleepin'? 
 The morning's already here 
 Are you dreamin'? 
 Can you hear Him in your ear 
 Let the fire burn infectious 
 You are His reflection 
 Are you sleepin'? 
 The morning's already here 
 He wakes up the stars 
 Lights the moon 
 Knows who you are 
 He put the light in you 
 He wakes up the stars 
 Lights the moon 
 Knows who you are 
 He put the light in you 
 Go glo-o-o-oh-ow 
 Go glo-o-o-oh-ow 
 Go glo-o-o-oh-ow 
 Go glow 
 They can see it 
 Shinin' all over your face 
 Oh, just believe it 
 That's the power of His grace 
 Let the fire burn infectious 
 You are His reflection 
 They can see it 
 Shinin' all over your face 
 Let the old you fade away 
 You ignite and light the day 
 Let the old you fade, old you fade, old you fade away

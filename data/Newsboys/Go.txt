Go album version: 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 To rely on (to rely on, realize) 
 Everybody needs somebody's 
 Shoulder to cry on (just to cry on, realize) 
 I am gonna lend a hand 
 And assist (I wanna send you there) 
 Go... 
 From the top of the world 
 To the bottom rung 
 'Til the work is done 
 I wanna send you 
 Go... 
 From the break of dawn 
 To the age's end 
 Somebody's needing a friend 
 I wanna send you 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 For the long ride (for the long ride, ride along) 
 Everybody needs somebody 
 Comin' alongside (come alongside, side along) 
 Are you gonna lend a hand... 
 Or a fist? (I wanna send you there) 
 Go... 
 From the top of the world 
 To the bottom rung 
 'Til the work is done 
 I wanna send you 
 Go... 
 From the break of dawn 
 To the age's end 
 Somebody's needing a friend 
 I wanna send you 
 Gonna send you out one by one 
 If I need it sung, can you sing it loud 
 Gonna send you two by two 
 Outta the ark, into the wild blue 
 Gonna come along by your side 
 Gonna send along my Spirit guide 
 I'm gonna show you miracles 
 Cover the earth 
 Make disciples 
 I wanna send you there 
 Go... 
 From the top of the world 
 To the bottom rung 
 'Til the work is done 
 I'm gonna send you 
 Go... 
 From the ends of the earth 
 To the nearest gap 
 All over the map 
 I wanna send you 
 Go... 
 From the top of the world 
 To the bottom rung 
 'Til the work is done 
 I wanna send you 
 Go.. 
 From the break of dawn 
 To the age's end 
 Somebody's needing a friend 
 I wanna send you

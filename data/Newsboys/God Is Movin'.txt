I'm the king of complacent 
 Always waiting for the right time 
 Just a permanent fixture 
 In the picture of a charmed life 
 I've been oblivious and unaware 
 That there's a war raging on out there 
 Between the good, the bad 
 Every day's a battle 
 But something's in the air 
 I can feel it, I can feel it 
 God is movin', movin', movin' 
 Love is alive, we're wakin' up 
 I can feel it, I can feel it 
 Yeah, God is movin', movin', movin' 
 I was one of the countless 
 Held captive by an enemy 
 But you and I we are living proof 
 That there's no heart too far out of reach 
 God, give us strength to fight these 
 Dark shadows trying to hide the light 
 We can't afford to be silent 
 On the sidelines anymore 
 'Cause something's in the air 
 I can feel it, I can feel it 
 God is movin', movin', movin' 
 Love is alive, we're wakin' up 
 I can feel it, I can feel it 
 Yeah, God is movin', movin', movin' 
 Be the light of the world 
 Be the light in us 
 Bringin' love to the lost and the broken 
 We are shining, we are shining 
 Be the light of the world 
 Be the light in us 
 Bringin' love to the lost and the broken 
 We are shining, we are shining 
 Something's in the air 
 I can feel it, I can feel it 
 God is movin', movin', movin' 
 Love is alive, we're wakin' up 
 I can feel it, I can feel it 
 Yeah, God is movin', movin', movin' 
 Be the light of the world 
 Be the light in us 
 Bringin' love to the lost and the broken 
 We are shining, we are shining 
 Be the light of the world 
 Be the light in us 
 Bringin' love to the lost and the broken 
 We are shining, we are shining

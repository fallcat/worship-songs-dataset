You don't understand 
 This is not what you think it is 
 You don't get it man 
 You want to boil it down to show biz 
 You're in-depth research shows 
 Drop the God, emphasize the beat 
 I've heard that positive pop you dig 
 I'd rather be buried in wet concrete 
 Take back your free advice 
 I don't accept 
 I will not play those games 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 You don't understand 
 I'm not talking multiple choice 
 You don't get it man 
 If the cross offends you, find another voice 
 I am not running for office here 
 I won't keep it purposefully vague 
 I've heard New Age Life-force trip 
 I'd rather be dipped in bubonic plague 
 Take back your free advice 
 I don't accept 
 I will not play those games 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 If we keep silent 
 If we mass defect 
 These very rocks will scream 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 And would I wash my hands again? 
 And would I wash my hands again? 
 Would I deny my Savior when 
 He hung inside the public square? 
 Did not my silence put Him there? 
 Take back your free advice, I don't accept 
 I will not play those games 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 If we keep silent, if we mass defect 
 These very rocks will scream 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 God is not a secret to be kept 
 God is not a secret to be kept

God of all Nations, Lord of Creation 
 It's in the bonds of love we meet 
 We come together at Your feet 
 Equal in Your sight, made one by Your might 
 You've called us to restore Your lands 
 And place them back within Your hands 
 So tonight 
 Be Glorified, be Magnified 
 As every nation lifts You high 
 Oh Father, tonight 
 It's our desire, to see Your Kingdom shine 
 On Earth as in Heaven tonight 
 God of all Nations, Lord of Creation 
 Your purpose is our hope, our bread 
 All You've planned and all You've said 
 Lord of the Heavens, Lord of the Ages 
 The church You build shall never fail 
 No gate or border will prevail 
 Tonight, be Glorified 
 Lifted up high, it's our desire 
 So tonight, be glorified 
 Lifted up high, it's our desire 
 Oh Father, tonight 
 It's our desire, You're Magnified 
 Lifted up high

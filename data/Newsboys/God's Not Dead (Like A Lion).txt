God's not dead 
 Let love explode and bring the dead to life 
 A love so bold to bring a revolution somehow 
 Let love explode and bring the dead to life 
 A love so bold to see a revolution somehow 
 Now I'm lost in Your freedom 
 And this world I'll overcome 
 My God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's livin' on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 Let hope arise and make the darkness hide 
 My faith is dead I need a resurrection somehow 
 I'm lost in your freedom 
 And this world I'll overcome 
 My God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's livin' on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 Let heaven roar, and fire fall 
 Come shake the ground 
 With the sound of revival 
 My God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's livin' on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion

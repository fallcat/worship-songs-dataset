She's been dazed and induced 
 Wants a part-time God for her private use 
 But she won't take a stand 
 'Cause she might get tagged as a closet Jesus fan 
 Sign on, the time is drawing near 
 This is surely a banner year 
 To be a public witness 
 Sign on, the lines are drawn and clear 
 There's no straddling fences here 
 We're going public with this 
 He's displaced and unglued 
 Scared that faith in God could be misconstrued 
 But the cross makes him wish 
 That his spine was more than a school of jellyfish 
 Sign on, the time is drawing near 
 This is surely a banner year 
 To be a public witness 
 (repeat)

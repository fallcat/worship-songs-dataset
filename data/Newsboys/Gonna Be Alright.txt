Go album version: 
 Inside me there's a child afraid of 
 Growing up and letting go 
 Inside me there's a world of danger 
 Could you pull this whole thing down 
 'Cause inside you there's much forgiveness 
 Endless love unconditional 
 And inside you there's a world of favor 
 Rising up (and) breaking through 
 Oh it's gonna be all right 
 All these things will have their time 
 Oh it's gonna be all right 
 All these things will find their time 
 Find their time 
 Inside me there's a child afraid of 
 Moving in and getting close 
 Inside you there's a world of healing 
 Ever free...so dangerous 
 Oh it's gonna be all right 
 All these things will have their time 
 Oh it's gonna be all right 
 All these things will find their time 
 Oh it's gonna be all right (gonna be all right) 
 All these things will have their time 
 Oh it's gonna be all right (it'll be all right) 
 All these things will find their time 
 Find their time 
 Gonna be all right 
 Gonna be all right 
 Gonna be all right 
 Gonna be all right 
 Gonna be all right 
 Gonna be all right 
 Gonna be all right 
 Gonna be all right

 Inside me there's a child afraid of 
 Growing up and letting go 
 Inside me there's a world of danger 
 Inside you there's, there's much forgiveness 
 And inside you there's a world of favor 
 Rising up (and) breaking through 
 Oh it's gonna be all right 
 All's gonna be all right 
 Shining through 
 Coming through 
 Coming through 
 Coming through 
 Inside me there's a child afraid, afraid afraid 
 And inside you there's a world of favor 
 Oh it's gonna be all right 
 All these things will have their time 
 Oh it's gonna be all right 
 All these things will find their time 
 Find their time

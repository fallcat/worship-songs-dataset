If I rise on wings of dawn 
 Or drift in seas of doubt 
 Even there, your strong right hand 
 Has never failed to guide me out 
 Great is Your faithfulness 
 To carry on with a sinner like me 
 Great is Your faithfulness 
 Turning shame into victory 
 Your grace has never let me be 
 Your mercy's waited patiently 
 Oh, so great is Your faithfulness 
 To carry on with a sinner like me 
 If I hide in dark and shadows 
 Fearful of each day 
 Even there 
 Your blinding light illuminates my pathway 
 Lord, Your goodness 
 Goodness never 
 Never fails 
 It never fails me

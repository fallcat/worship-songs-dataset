When did it become breaking a rule 
 To say Your name out loud in school 
 When Your name is the only one that sets us free 
 When did it become incorrect 
 To speak the truth about life and death 
 When Your life gave us all eternity 
 Even if it gets me convicted 
 I'll be on my knees with my hands lifted 
 If serving You is against the law of man 
 If living out my faith in You was banned 
 Then I'll stand right before the jury 
 If saying 'I believe' is out of line 
 If I'm judged 'cause I'm gonna give my life 
 To show the world the love that fills me 
 Then I want to be guilty 
 I'll rise up and honor You 
 I'll testify to the good You do 
 'Cause your grace and Your mercy have overtaken me 
 Guilty by association 
 Guilty of being a voice proclaiming 
 Your ways 
 Your truth 
 Your life 
 I'll pay the price to be Your light 
 I want to be guilty

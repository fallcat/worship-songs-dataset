Walk into the sunlight so bright 
 Illumination blocking out the night 
 She knows that the promises are airtight 
 There is no doubt and you can see it in her eyes 
 You'll hear her singing to heaven 
 Even without letting out a word to be heard 
 In every single situation (none too big - none too small) 
 She looks up and the world looks on 
 She sings hallelujah 
 When all has become nothing 
 And her hope in the saviour 
 Has colored all she does 
 And taints the way she loves 
 She sings hallelujah 
 And falls to the ground again 
 With hands stretched up to the sky 
 She's waiting for the day she'll hear the father say... 
 Step into the spotlight - so bright 
 A character check in the dead of night 
 To cut the stays of reason, till death defy 
 All understanding in the neighbour's eye 
 To run this race like this day's the last celebrate 
 In all we do and all we say look up 
 'Cause the world looks on 
 She sings hallelujah 
 When all has become nothing 
 And her hope in the saviour 
 Has colored all she does 
 And taints the way she loves 
 She sings hallelujah 
 And falls to the ground again 
 With hands stretched up to the sky 
 She's waiting for the day she'll hear the father say... 
 We sing hallelujah 
 When all has become nothing 
 And our hope in the saviour 
 Has colored all we do 
 Let it be for you 
 We'll sing hallelujah 
 And fall to the ground again 
 With hands stretched up to the sky 
 We're waiting for the day 
 We'll hear the father say 
 Yeah, to hear him say 
 "Well done, good and faithful one 
 Enter in, come on, share with me 
 Welcome home good and faithful one 
 On an on through eternity'"

An image flashed across my TV screen 
 Another broken heart comes into view 
 I saw the pain and I turned my back 
 Why can't I do the things I want to? 
 I am willing yet am so afraid 
 You give me strength when I say ... 
 I wanna be your hands 
 I wanna be your feet 
 I'll go where you send me, go where you send me 
 I'll be your hands 
 I'll be your feet 
 I'll go where you send me, go where you send me 
 And I'll try, yeah I'll try 
 To touch the world 
 Like you touched my life 
 And I'll find my way 
 To be your hands 
 I'll abandon every selfish thought 
 I surrender everything I've got 
 You can have everything I am 
 And perfect everything I'm not 
 I am willing, I'm not afraid 
 You give me strength when I say ... 
 I wanna be your hands 
 I wanna be your feet 
 I'll go where you send me, go where you send me 
 I'll be your hands 
 I'll be your feet 
 I'll go where you send me, go where you send me 
 And I'll try, yeah I'll try 
 To touch the world 
 Like you touched my life 
 And I'll find my way 
 This is the last time 
 I turn my back on you 
 From now on I'll go out 
 Send me where you want me to 
 I finally have a mission 
 I promise I'll complete 
 I don't need excuses 
 When I am your hands and feet 
 I am your hands and feet 
 Hands,(Hands) (Hands) 
 Feet, (Feet) (Feet) 
 Go, (Go) (Go) 
 Go, (Go) (Go) 
 I wanna be your hands 
 I wanna be your feet 
 I'll go where you send me, go where you send me 
 I'll be your hands 
 I'll be your feet 
 I'll go where you send me, go where you send me 
 I'll be your hands 
 I'll be your feet 
 I will go 
 I will go where you send me 
 I will go 
 I will go where you send me 
 I will go, go 
 I will go, go 
 I will GO! 
 Go where you send me 
 I wanna be your hands 
 I wanna be your feet

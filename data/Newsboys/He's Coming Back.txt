Things are getting tough. 
 You got to hang in there. 
 When you're just about to quit, 
 Let God be God. 
 When your back's against the wall, 
 His love will be true. 
 When you're feeling two feet tall, 
 Stand upon the rock. 
 You won't be afraid for He is with you. 
 Don't be afraid for He is with you. 
 He's comin' back like He promised He would. 
 Let's be ready when the trumpet sounds. 
 He's comin' back like He promised He would. 
 Let's be ready when the trumpet sounds. 
 He's comin' back like He promised He would. 
 Let's be ready when the trumpet sounds. 
 He's comin' back like He promised He would. 
 Let's be ready when the trumpet sounds.

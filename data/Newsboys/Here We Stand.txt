We can see it, God You're moving 
 We can feel it, in our bones 
 Turn our hearts to all You're doing 
 With a shout we cry 
 With a shout we cry 
 Open wide heaven's gates 
 Let your glory fill this place 
 Here we stand in awe 
 Here we stand in awe 
 Lifting high every heart 
 Giving You every part 
 Here we stand in awe 
 Here we stand in awe 
 We are filled with expectation 
 As we're reaching for Your throne 
 There's an anthem, hear it rising 
 With a shout we cry 
 With a shout we cry 
 There's nothing like Your presence God 
 There's nothing like Your presence God 
 There's nothing like Your presence God 
 There's nothing like Your presence God

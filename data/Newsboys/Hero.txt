I, I wanna follow like a shadow 
 I don't need no one to see me, I just wanna chase You down 
 I, I wanna trail like an echo 
 I don't need no one to hear me, I just wanna make You loud 
 I'm about one name, one life, one story 
 I'm alive to bring You glory 
 You took my blame and You paid the debt I owed 
 I'm gonna lay me down to lift You up 
 You're the only king in the kingdom come 
 If I live, if I die, my life will show 
 You're my hero 
 Light shattering the darkness 
 Taking up a cross, You reached beyond my brokenness 
 Love overturning all the heartache 
 Taking on a grave, leaving death powerless 
 You took the nails 
 I'm forgiven 
 Cleared my name 
 Every sin is 
 Washed away 
 It is finished 
 You're the reason I am free 
 I'm about Your name, Your life, Your story 
 You are who You say You are 
 The evidence is in my heart

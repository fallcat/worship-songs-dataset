I see the neon lights 
 As they light the city sky. 
 I see a desperate boy 
 At the moment that he cries. 
 I see him reaching out. 
 His hand is to the sky. 
 I'm tellin' you, don't let go. 
 God is on your side. 
 Hold on tight, never let Him go. 
 Hold on tight, hold on. 
 I feel the innocence. 
 He's washed my sins away. 
 I'm not afraid of the future now. 
 His will is here to stay. 
 Reach out and hold on tight. 
 He's with you all the time. 
 I'm telling you, don't let go. 
 God is on your side. 
 Hold on tight, never let Him go. 
 Hold on tight, hold on. 
 Keep on reaching out to Him. 
 He's with you all the time. 
 Don't ever, ever let go. 
 God is on your side. 
 Hold on tight, never let Him go. 
 Hold on tight, hold on. 
 Hold on tight, never let Him go. 
 Hold on tight, never let Him go. 
 Hold on tight, never let Him go. 
 Hold on tight, hold on.

Through You the blind will see 
 Through You the mute will sing 
 Through You the dead will rise 
 Through You all hearts will praise 
 Through You the darkness flees 
 Through You my heart screams 
 I am free 
 Yes, I am free 
 And I am free to run, (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance, (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You, (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free, I am free (Yes, I am free, I am free) 
 Through You the kingdom comes 
 Through You the battle's won 
 Through You the price is paid 
 Through You I'm not afraid 
 Through You there's victory 
 Because of You my soul sings 
 I am free 
 And I am free to run, (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance, (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You, (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free, I am free (Yes, I am free, I am free) 
 Who the Son sets free - is free indeed 
 No 
 And I am free to run, (I am free to run) 
 I am free to dance, (I am free to dance) 
 I am free to live for You, (I am free to live for You) 
 I am free, I am free (Yes, I am free, I am free)

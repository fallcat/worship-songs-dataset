There's a me that I don't really like 
 A me that says I'm 
 In control till the day that I die 
 And I don't know why 
 I push I pull I fight I fall 
 I end up crawling back to 
 That place where I figure it out 
 That I, that I, that I 
 I'm second to one 
 Redeemer, the way, the light 
 I'm second to one 
 The savior 
 No compromise 
 I'm laying everything 
 At the foot of the cross 
 My pride, my life, my all 
 I am second to one 
 And he is second to none 
 There's a change when I swallow my pride 
 And I surrender 
 There's a peace when I open my eyes 
 'Cause I remember 
 To live's to die 
 To fall's to rise 
 To kneel's to find the Savior 
 Here I am and I've figured it out 
 Tonight tonight tonight... 
 He said "You come alive 
 When you lose your life" 
 So I lay it down 
 Yeah I surrender all

I got your number 
 Where love can be found 
 I got your number 
 Where truth can be found 
 I asked you in one day 
 And you came into my life 
 I got your number 
 For the rest of my life 
 I can feel your love 
 Flowing out to me 
 Each day and night 
 I can see clearly now 
 I see your eyes in the starry skies 
 I can feel your life flowing out to me 
 With each breath I take 
 I can see clearly now 
 Your Spirit has shown me the perfect way 
 I've got your number 
 And I'm happy to say 
 You set my heart on fire 
 With every move you make 
 When you walk into a room 
 It lights up with your grace 
 I got your number now 
 It's the hot line to your place 
 You say you say you want 
 You say you say you want 
 You say you say you want to be free 
 You want you want you want 
 You want you want you want 
 You want you want you want to be free 
 You can you can you can 
 You can you can who can? 
 You can you can you can be free 
 I got your number 
 It's written deep within my heart 
 You filled that emptiness 
 And lighted up a new part 
 There's much more to life 
 Than other numbers on the wall 
 I got your number 
 It's a burning deep within my soul

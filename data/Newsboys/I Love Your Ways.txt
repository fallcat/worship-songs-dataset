They shine like dawn on an open Psalm 
 A knowing smile from something You said 
 I hunger for the daily bread of Your ways 
 Ah, the bread of Your ways 
 They glow like blue in a field of black 
 Illuminating the runway ahead 
 I love to follow the angel tread of Your ways 
 Ah, the tread of Your ways 
 I love Your ways (Your true, Your perfect ways) 
 I love Your ways (so beautiful to me) 
 Lovely always (and faithful to restore) 
 I love Your ways 
 And when I tire, they bring a second wind 
 A word in season, a gleam in Your eye 
 I love to feel the runner's high of Your ways 
 Ah, the high of Your ways 
 I lived so long under basement floors 
 The flickering lights, the windowless gloom 
 I'm here to stay in the upper room of Your ways 
 Ah, the room of Your ways 
 I love Your ways (Your true, Your perfect ways) 
 I love Your ways (so beautiful to me) 
 Lovely always (and faithful to restore) 
 I love Your ways 
 I need Your good word speaking 
 When there's nothing to say 
 I need Your Spirit here 
 Breathing on me every day 
 Every night I need Your love's pure light 
 And I've learned forever to trust 
 Ever to follow 
 Ever I'll praise Your everlasting ways 
 (Your everlasting ways 
 Your everlasting ways) 
 I love Your ways (Your true, Your perfect ways) 
 I love Your ways (so beautiful to me) 
 Lovely always (and faithful to restore) 
 I love Your ways 
 I love Your ways

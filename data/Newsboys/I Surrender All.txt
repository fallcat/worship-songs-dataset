I surrender all 
 To the promises you made 
 And I will give it all 
 To the maker of the day 
 No one knows your heart 
 And no one knows your fears 
 When no one solves the mysteries 
 Or even wipes away the tears 
 Can you hear the sound of laughter 
 From the other side of life? 
 There are days when I feel like a stranger sometimes 
 Tell me, are there any other fools like me? 
 This reliance on another world 
 Has a great effect on this world 
 This conscience of another world 
 Has a great effect on grace recollection 
 He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are 
 He only loves us 'cause of who he is 
 He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are 
 He only loves us 'cause of who he is 
 I surrender all

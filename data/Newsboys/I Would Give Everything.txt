I would give everything (da-da da da da-da-da) 
 To give nothing more (da-da da da da-da-da) 
 I would give everything (da-da da da da-da-da) 
 To give nothing more (da-da da da da-da-da) 
 Walk outside 
 You're standing in the rain 
 Eyes collide 
 We both know I'm to blame 
 See me cry 
 Feel like Judas for awhile 
 Absolution 
 I'm feeling so tired 
 Bygones by 
 You took away the blame 
 This humanity haunts me 
 Everyday I feel ashamed 
 How long till everything is new? 
 How long till our bodies are renewed? 
 How long till we see you face to face? 
 How long till we reach that perfect place?

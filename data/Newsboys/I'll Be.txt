<If you're sinking 
 If you're losing control 
 And your heartache 
 Has taken it's toll 
 If there's things you've 
 Never thought before Like you're all alone 
 Afraid that love won't 
 Come home You will find me 
 At the point of your 
 Breaking 
 Behind all the noise 
 When your world is 
 Darkest I can still see 'Cause when there's 
 Nothing left I'll be I'll be Like a small town 
 Talk is getting around 
 Now that you've found 
 A friend can still bring 
 You down And when their faith in 
 You comes crashing 
 Down 
 Know that I'm still yours I'll be the hope that endures You will find me 
 At the point of your 
 Breaking 
 Behind all the noise 
 When your world is 
 Darkest I can still see 'Cause when there's 
 Nothing left I'll be I'll be the light to help you find 
 All the things you left 
 Behind 
 Wondering will love 
 Come back I'll be whispering you're still mine 
 When loneliness 
 Invades your mind 
 You're gonna be all right 
 You will find me I'm at the point of 
 Your breaking 
 Behind all the noise You will find me 
 At the point of your 
 Breaking 
 Behind all the noise 
 When your world is 
 Darkest I can still see 'Cause when there's 
 Nothing left 
 'Cause when there's 
 Nothing left I'll be>

I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 What are we sneaking around for? 
 Who are we trying to please? 
 Shrugging off sin, apologizing like we're spreading some kind of disease 
 I'm saying, "No way, no way" 
 I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 This one says it's a lost cause 
 Save your testimonies for church time 
 The other ones state you'd better wait until you do a little market research 
 I'm saying, "No way, no way" 
 I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ 
 I'm not ashamed to let you know 
 I want this light in me to show 
 I'm not ashamed to speak the name of Jesus Christ

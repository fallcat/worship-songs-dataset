I can't see myself without You 
 With You I get strength to do things I've never ever dreamt in a million years 
 I'm unstoppable 'cause You're here with me 
 Unbelievable how I can believe how powerful You've caused me to be, yeah 
 See only You got me flying with eagles, walking on water 
 With You I can do the impossible 
 Jump over mountains with one single bound 
 I've found out I can do the impossible 
 Do the impossible 
 No other soul could have saved me 
 I feel You in every heartbeat 
 You're incredible, invincible - so easy to see You've strengthened me 
 I'm out of this world, oh yeah, now that I'm with You 
 I'm unbreakable, there ain't no way I can lose 
 See only You got me flying with eagles, walking on water 
 With You I can do the impossible 
 Jump over mountains with one single bound 
 I've found out I can do the impossible 
 Do the impossible 
 'Cause heaven is at the end of this road 
 Me and You, now I know I'm not alone 
 You're pierced in my heart, You're not just in my head 
 This is what makes You the best 
 See only You got me flying with eagles, walking on water 
 With You I can do the impossible 
 Jump over mountains with one single bound 
 I've found out I can do the impossible 
 Do the impossible 
 No other soul could have saved me 
 I feel You in every heartbeat

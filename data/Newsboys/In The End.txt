I'm sick and tired on the world tellin' me 
 How to live my life 
 What beer I should drink to make me feel all right 
 The standards dropping the streets need mopping 
 The worlds tryin' to change the rules 
 They've forgotten just how we begun 
 Humanism taken ist toll 
 We'll know who's right in the end 
 Every knee shall bow 
 We'll know who's right in the end 
 Every tongue confess 
 So be a man and make up your mind 
 How to live your life 
 What standard have you set 
 To make you feel all right 
 The church is rising, no compromising 
 Holiness is cool 
 Men laugh, in the end they'll die 
 Evolutionists will pay the toll 
 I'm sick and tired of the world tellin' me 
 How to live my life 
 What beer I should drink to make me feel all right 
 The standards dropping the streets need mopping 
 The worlds tryin' to change the rules 
 They've forgotten just how we begun 
 Humanism has taken its toll

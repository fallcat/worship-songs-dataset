We have raised our hopes and our cities high 
 We have followed fragile dreams 
 But only One could take the measure of our goals 
 And we've stumbled over the trials of life 
 And we've wrestled the unseen 
 But only One can calm the storm inside our souls 
 In the hands of God we will fall 
 Rest for the restless, and the weary 
 Hope for the sinner 
 In the hands of God we stand tall 
 Hands that are mighty to deliver 
 Giving us freedom 
 When our strength gave way to the weight of guilt 
 'Til we strained for every breath 
 Only One could lift our shame and make us well 
 And when all is finished and we face 
 The fearsome power of death 
 Only One has overcome the gates of hell 
 You're amazing 
 You're amazing, You are 
 And we praise You, Lord 
 For what Your hands have done

Go album version: 
 So much wonder 
 Carved in Your coral seas 
 So much wonder 
 Shaded by ancient trees 
 I consider all that Your hands have made 
 Every newborn's eyes, every new sunrise 
 No power can tame Your presence 
 No light can match Your radiance 
 Let all creation sing in wonder 
 Every sea, every creature, every star 
 You opened up my eyes to wonder 
 What a vision, what a wonder You are 
 Such a wonder 
 Ordering time and tide 
 Such a wonder 
 Bridging the great divide 
 I consider all that You had, all You gave 
 And all that You endured 
 From this rebel world 
 What a wondrous cross You chose to bear 
 What a wonder You would even care 
 Let all creation sing in wonder 
 Every sea, every creature, every star 
 You opened up my eyes to wonder 
 What a vision, what a wonder You are 
 Let every rock cry out 
 Let every knee bow down 
 You opened up my heart to wonder 
 What a love, what a wonder You are 
 No power can tame Your presence 
 No light can match Your radiance 
 Such a wonder... 
 Such a wonder... 
 Let all creation sing in wonder 
 Every sea, every creature, every star 
 You opened up my eyes to wonder 
 What a vision, what a wonder You are 
 Let all creation sing in wonder 
 Every sea, every creature, every star 
 You opened up my eyes to wonder 
 What a vision, what a wonder You are 
 Let every rock cry out 
 Let every knee bow down 
 You opened up my heart to wonder 
 What love, what a wonder You are

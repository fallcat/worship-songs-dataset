Rise up and shine, oh nation of Israel 
 Don't you know you are the apple of His eye 
 Rise up in power, you chosen people 
 It's time for you to take your wings and fly 
 Rise up and shine 
 Your hour has come 
 End times are coming 
 I know you'll go the distance 
 End times are here 
 I know you will not fall 
 All nations will sound up in these final days 
 They come from everywhere just to see you fall 
 Keep your eyes fixed upon the mighty Saviour 
 Don't let your heart despair at all 
 Rise up and shine 
 Your hour has come

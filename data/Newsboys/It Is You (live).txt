As we lift up our hands 
 Will you meet us here? 
 As we call on your name 
 Will you meet us here? 
 We have come to this place 
 To worship you 
 God of mercy and grace 
 It is you 
 We adore 
 It is you 
 Praises are for 
 Only you 
 The heaven's declare 
 It is you 
 It is you 
 Holy, holy is our God Almighty 
 Holy, holy is his name alone 
 Holy, holy is our God Almighty 
 Holy, holy is his name alone

For the want of a marker 
 The doctors lost their place 
 For the want of a cut-line 
 They couldn't lift his face 
 For the want of a face lift 
 His ratings dropped 
 Then the sitcom folded 
 Then the network flopped 
 After the climb 
 After time turns designs to despair 
 It is good 
 Nothing's fair 
 It's all who you know 
 For the want of a cough drop 
 The musher's throat went hoarse 
 For the want of direction 
 The huskies went off course 
 Then the sled got snowbound 
 It took some time to free'em 
 Now they're on display 
 Inside the British Museum 
 After the climb 
 After time turns designs to despair 
 It is good 
 Nothing's fair 
 It's all who you know 
 And after the fall 
 After all of our strivings are dust 
 Even so 
 Good for us 
 It's all who you know 
 For the want of a compass 
 We'd be shuffling charts 
 For the want of good radar 
 We'd be glacier parts 
 For the want of a lighthouse 
 Can't you see 
 We'd be lost at sea 
 Lost at sea 
 After the climb 
 After time turns designs to despair 
 It is good 
 Nothing's fair 
 It's all who you know 
 And after the fall 
 After all of our strivings are dust 
 Even so 
 Good for us 
 It's all who you know

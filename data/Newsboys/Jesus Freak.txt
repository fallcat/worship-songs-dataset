Separated, I cut myself clean from a past that comes back in my darkest of dreams 
 Been apprehended by a spiritual force and a grace that replaced all the me I divorced 
 I saw a man with a tat on his big fat belly 
 It wiggled around like marmalade jelly 
 It took me a while to catch what it said, 'cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head 
 "Jesus Saves" is what it raved in a typical tattoo green 
 He stood on a box in the middle of the city and he claimed he had a dream... 
 What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak? 
 What will people do when they find that it's true? 
 I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak - there ain't no disguising the truth 
 There ain't no disguising the truth 
 No I ain't into hiding the Truth 
 Kamikaze, my death is gain - I've been marked by my Maker, a peculiar display 
 The high and lofty, they see me as weak - but I won't live and die for the power they seek 
 There was a man from the desert with naps in his head 
 The sand that he walked was also his bed 
 The words that he spoke make the people assume there wasn't too much left in the upper room 
 With skins on his back and hair on his face, they thought he was strange from the locusts he ate 
 All the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak until the king took the head of this Jesus freak 
 What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus freak? 
 What will people do when they find that it's true? 
 I don't really care if they label me a Jesus freak - there ain't no disguising the truth 
 No I ain't into hiding the Truth 
 People say I'm strange, does it make me a stranger that my best friend was born in a manger? 
 What will people think (what will people think?) 
 What will people do (what will people do?) 
 I don't really care (what else can I say?) 
 There ain't no disguising the Truth (Jesus is the Way)

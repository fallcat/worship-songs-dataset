Roll down the window 
 Don't shift in your seat 
 I don't care if the wind blows 
 I don't care about the heat 
 All those John Woo showdowns 
 Don't prepare you for this 
 A little bit face-off 
 A little killer's kiss 
 Stop, look, listen hard 
 This is why a band hires a body guard 
 Fear draws them 
 Don't let it show 
 Driver, there's a bee trapped in my limo 
 When a bug plays chicken 
 Feathers fly 
 The driver's allergic 
 One sting and we die 
 A real buzz killer 
 Wouldn't have missed 
 I'm just making it meaner 
 With every flick of my guchi wielding wrist 
 Stop, look, listen hard 
 This is why a band hires a body guard 
 Fear draws them, don't let it show 
 Driver, there's a mad bee in my limo 
 John Woo, John Woo 
 John Woo, John Woo 
 Stop, look, listen hard 
 This is why I needed a library card 
 Fear finds them knocking about 
 Driver, there's a metaphor trying to get out

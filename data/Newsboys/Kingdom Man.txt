Step by step 
 Day by day 
 You have changed my world 
 I am a Kingdom man 
 I heard the birds a singing 
 Saw the flowers 
 In the field 
 Thy heart was all on fire 
 With that moment I did yield 
 I shout it form the rooftop 
 Shout it from the hills 
 I'm now a new creation 
 I have found my way 
 Step by step 
 Day by day 
 You have changed my world 
 I am a Kingdom man 
 Jesus lifted me out of the miry clay 
 He stood me on a rack 
 And that's where I will stay 
 Ma name is down in heaven 
 No man can take it out 
 The Word of God is true 
 It casts out all the doubt

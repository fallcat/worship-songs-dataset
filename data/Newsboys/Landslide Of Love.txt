Opening salvo 
 Didn't help solve anything 
 Every time we shout our rights out 
 We get all grouchy and gray 
 It's all about me, me 
 It's all about what I can take 
 And if that doesn't ring true anymore 
 Maybe it was our first mistake 
 And since we don't believe in Santa Claus 
 Maybe we'd best stay awake 
 Every time a teardrop falls 
 It's kicking up dust in our world of pain 
 Let's get drenched under God's good rain 
 Caught in a deluge of mercies 
 Like a pebble clings to dirt 
 We're still clinging to bedrock sin 
 Let's get swept off our feet again 
 Caught in a landslide of love 
 It's all about me, me 
 It's all about all I can take 
 The good I try to do goes nowhere 
 The bad just seizes the day 
 And if we're here for something bigger, baby 
 There's gotta be some better way 
 Every time a teardrop falls 
 It's kicking up dust in our world of pain 
 Let's get drenched under God's good rain 
 Caught in a deluge of mercies 
 Like a pebble clings to dirt 
 We're still clinging to bedrock sin 
 Let's get swept off our feet again 
 Caught in a landslide of love 
 No, not angels or devils 
 No, not famine or war 
 No, not the past or the present 
 Not even the ground separates from God's love 
 Not even the ground separates from His love 
 'Cause every time a teardrop falls 
 It's kicking up dust in our world of pain 
 Let's get drenched under God's good rain 
 Caught in a deluge of mercies 
 And like a pebble cased in dirt 
 We've been anchored in bedrock sin 
 Let's get swept off our feet again 
 Caught in a landslide of love 
 Caught in a landslide of love

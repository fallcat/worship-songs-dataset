Savior I come 
 Quiet my soul 
 Remember redemption's hill 
 Where your blood was spilled 
 For my ransom 
 Everything I once held dear 
 I count it all as loss 
 Lead me to the cross 
 Where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees 
 Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself 
 I belong to you 
 Oh lead me, lead me to the cross 
 You were as I, tempted and tried 
 Human 
 The word became flesh 
 Bore my sin and death 
 Now You're risen 
 Everything I once held dear 
 I count it all as loss 
 Lead me to the cross 
 Where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees 
 Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself, I belong to you 
 Oh lead me, lead me to the cross 
 To your heart 
 To your heart 
 Lead me to your heart 
 To your heart 
 Lead me to the cross, 
 Where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees 
 Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself, I belong to you 
 Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

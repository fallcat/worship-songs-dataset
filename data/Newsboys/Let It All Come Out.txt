Go album version: 
 Who, who's touched you child?  Now you can't feel a thing, not anything 
 Who's been the one telling you lies?  Now you'll believe anything 
 Oh, you gotta let, let it all come out 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Right now 
 Right now 
 How, how many fires, to make you feel pure again, alive again? 
 And what will it take, what has to break, for you to begin again? 
 What will it take? 
 Oh, you gotta let, let it all come out 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Right now 
 Right now 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Right now 
 Right now 
 Lift yourself out of it all 
 Come out from the shadows to the sun 
 Oh you gotta lift yourself out of it all 
 Yesterday's over, a new day's begun 
 You're only sick as all your secrets 
 Let them all come out, let them come 
 'Cause the devil came to steal your name away 
 The devil came to give your name away 
 Oh, let, let it all come out 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Oh, let, let it all come out 
 Right now 
 Right now 
 Oh, you've got to  let, let it all come out 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Right now 
 Right now 
 Let, let it all come out 
 Bless all our hearts 
 Bless all our hearts 
 Bless all our hearts 
 Bless all our hearts

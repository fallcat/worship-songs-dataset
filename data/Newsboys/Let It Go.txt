You are waiting on a beach 
 For a healing word to come 
 Maybe an apology in a bottle 
 Maybe a flare that says I'm sorry 
 And the hurting leaves you numb 
 Will you forgive? 
 Will you forget? 
 Will you live what you know? 
 He left his rights 
 Will you leave yours? 
 You don't understand it 
 Let it go 
 You are waiting on a beach 
 This is where the east meets west 
 And as another sun sets on your anger 
 The darkness laughs as the wound destroys 
 And it turns your prayers to noise 
 Will you forgive? 
 Wil you forget? 
 Will you live what you know? 
 He left his rights 
 Will you leave yours? 
 You won't understand it 
 Let it go 
 This bitterness you hide 
 It seeps into your soul 
 And it steals your joy 
 Till it's all you know 
 Let it go 
 Will you forgive? 
 Will you forget? 
 Will you live what you know? 
 He left his rights 
 Will you leave yours? 
 You won't understand it 
 Let it go 
 Will you forgive? 
 Will you forget? 
 Will you live what you know? 
 Beneath the cross 
 You hear his words 
 "Father forgive them" 
 And you know 
 You can't understand it 
 Let it go

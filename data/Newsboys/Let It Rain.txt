A fisher of men remembers... 
 And I have watched in wonder 
 As with a word You calmed a raging sea 
 I have seen You make the wine from water 
 Mud and water made a blind man see 
 Water still reminds me 
 Of the seaside where our eyes first met 
 Let it rain 
 Lord, we're waiting for Your rain to fall 
 Let it rain 
 Bringing back the wonder of it all 
 And I can see your face again 
 When you let it rain 
 And I've been bathed in mercy 
 By every gesture, every word You've said 
 Once I spoke of power and high position 
 You took a towel and washed my feet insted 
 Water, like a promise 
 Heaven opens, but I'm not there yet 
 Let it rain 
 Lord, we're waiting for Your rain to fall 
 Let it rain 
 Bringing back the wonder of it all 
 And I can see your face again 
 When you let it rain 
 I've been foolish 
 Thought I knew it all 
 Three times I denied Your name 
 Your forgiveness, like a waterfall 
 Washes away my shame 
 A new dawn is breaking 
 Another hour, and then I leave this place 
 I am ready, Lord, to give my life up 
 I'm so ready, Lord, to see Your face 
 Water, like a promise 
 And in this final hour, I think my 
 Final prayer shall be 
 Would you let it rain? 
 Let Your Spirit fall afresh on me 
 Let it rain 
 Lord, we're waiting for Your rain to fall 
 Let it rain 
 Bringing back the wonder of it all 
 And I can see your face again 
 When you let it rain

Okay now, here we go. 
 Well I was walkin' down the street just the other day, 
 Mindin' my own business I say. 
 I saw a bloke standing on the side of the street 
 And waving his Bible and being everything but discreet. 
 You know what's right from wrong. 
 Don't say no way. 
 Don't wait till things go wrong. 
 Seek Him today. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us. 
 Oh yeah. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us. 
 Uh-huh. 
 You know I'm not usually one to stop 
 And talk to people like this, you know, yeah, 
 But something inside of me was building up 
 And needin' to find out what he had to say. 
 You know what's right from wrong. 
 Don't say no way. 
 Don't wait till things go wrong. 
 Seek Him today. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us. 
 Oh yeah. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us. 
 Uh-huh. Oh yeah. 
 Well that was several months ago. 
 Now my life has changed because 
 Someone cared to say... 
 He stands at the door of your heart and knocks. 
 Open up the door and don't keep it locked today, today. 
 You know what's right from wrong. 
 Don't say no way. 
 Don't wait till things go wrong. 
 Seek Him today. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us. 
 Oh yeah. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us. 
 Mhmm. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us. 
 Love and joy and peace and hope 
 Is what He offers us.

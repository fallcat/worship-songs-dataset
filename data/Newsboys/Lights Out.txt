Last one turns the lights out, and 
 Makes sure every curtain's drawn 
 Nails the shutters shut, he's sure 
 We are not of this world for long 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Did you figure out the date? 
 What do you hope to do 
 While you sit around and wait, wait, wait? 
 Last one turns the lights out, and 
 Disconnects the answer phone 
 Stuffs all sense of mission, says 
 "I just can't turn the tide alone" 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Did you figure out the time? 
 What do you hope to do 
 While you hide out and whine, whine, whine... 
 Don't go shuttin' down 
 Till the trumpet sounds 
 And the battle is won 
 Don't go punchin' out 
 Till the final shout 
 And the Father says, 
 "Well done" 
 Last one turns the light out, and 
 Just keeps playing dumb 
 These were his instructions, he's 
 Not sure where he got 'em from 
 Why do you wanna hide 
 In a separate class? 
 Why do you buy the lie 
 Of faith under glass, glass, glass... 
 Don't go shuttin' down... 
 Last one shoots the light sout, and 
 Climbs up to the top of the roof 
 He's sitting there till the Second Coming 
 Says he's got mathematical proof 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Did you figure out the date? 
 What do you hope to do 
 While you sit around and wait, wait, wait... 
 Don't go shuttin' down...

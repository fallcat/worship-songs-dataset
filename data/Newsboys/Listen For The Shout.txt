Can you feel His power flowin' through your heart - yeah 
 Have you ever wondered if you are apart 
 Signs and times are changin' the world is rearranging 
 Mankind is actin' playing with the flesh 
 Listen for the shout, He's commin' back again 
 Listen for the shout, He's commin' back again 
 Listen for the shout, He's commin' back again 
 Listen for the shout, He's commin' back again 
 So raise your eyes and look around and pick yourself up off the ground 
 You can make it and you can win 
 You have the pwer through Him 
 Be delighted in the Lord 
 And he will give you your hearts desire 
 For when he spoke the world began 
 It appeared at His command 
 Our sins have gone as far as what the east is from the west 
 The wealth and riches of the land would not even fill His hand 
 So raise your voice and praise his name 
 Your life will never be the same 
 I thank the Lord I'm born again 
 And soon I'll see him come again

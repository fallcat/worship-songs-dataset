This field guide's 
 Got no soul 
 Digging for the sacred 
 In a man-made hole 
 The soil gets harder 
 The shovel won't behave 
 I just dug myself 
 Into a six foot grave 
 I need a new dimension 
 Got to Supersize 
 A Jacobean ladder 
 To a parallel prize 
 The walk's by faith 
 The sight lines lie 
 How'm I gonna tag along 
 With one tin ear 
 And one glass eye 
 Well I... 
 I can't get there from here 
 When every sense is in mono 
 Walk by faith, you appear 
 I wanna live in stereo 
 I can't get there from here 
 Without a God-directed go 
 Walk by faith, you appear 
 I gotta live in stereo. 
 I quit, I fold, I'm done 
 Trying to scale Everest 
 Sherpa-less 
 Ain't fun 
 The best laid plans 
 Are in my other pants 
 The base camp's buried 
 In an avalanche 
 I need a new dimension 
 Got to Supersize 
 A Jacobean ladder 
 To a parallel prize 
 The walk's by faith 
 The lone wolf dies 
 But how'm I gonna follow you 
 With blue man ears 
 And snow blind eyes? 
 Well I...

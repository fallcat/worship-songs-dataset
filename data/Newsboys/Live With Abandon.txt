Chasing after this world makes me tired 
 Praisin' my own name leaves me dry 
 There's gotta be so much more to life than this 
 A higher calling that I missed 
 I want my life to count, every breath 
 I wanna live with abandon 
 Give You all that I am 
 Every part of my heart Jesus 
 I place in Your hands 
 I wanna live with abandon 
 I'll drop everything to follow You 
 It's only Your hands I hold onto 
 There's gotta be more to life than this 
 A higher calling that I missed 
 I want my life to count, every breath 
 I'm not looking back 
 I'm done with that 
 Wanna give You all I have

You are the author of knowledge 
 You can redeem what's been done 
 You hold the present and all that's to come 
 Until your everlasting kingdom 
 Lord, I don't know where all this is going 
 Or how it all works out 
 Lead me to peace that is past understanding 
 A peace beyond all doubt 
 You are the God of tomorrow 
 Turning the darkness to dawn 
 Lifting the hopeless with hope to go on 
 You are the rock of all salvation 
 Lord, I don't know where all this is going 
 Or how it all works out 
 Lead me to peace that is past understanding 
 A peace beyond all doubt 
 Oh, Lord, you are the author 
 Redeeming what's been done 
 You hold us in the present 
 And all that is to come 
 Lord, we don't know where all this is going 
 Or how it all works out 
 Lead us to peace that is past understanding 
 A peace beyond all doubt

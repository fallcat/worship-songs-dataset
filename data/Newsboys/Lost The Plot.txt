When You come back again 
 Would You bring me something from the fridge? 
 Heard a rumor that the end is near 
 But I just got comfortable here. 
 Sigh. 
 Let's be blunt. 
 I'm a little distracted. 
 What do You want? 
 Headaches and bad faith 
 Are all that I've got. 
 First I misplaced the ending 
 Then I lost the plot. 
 Out among free-range sheep 
 While the big birds sharpen their claws. 
 For a time we stuck with the Shepherd 
 But You wouldn't play Santa Claus 
 Sigh. 
 Let's be blunt. 
 We're a little distracted. 
 What do You want? 
 Once we could follow, 
 Now we cannot. 
 You would not fit our image, 
 So we lost the plot 
 Once we could hear You. 
 Now our senses are shot. 
 We've fogotten our first love. 
 We have lost the plot. 
 When I saw You for the first time 
 You were hanging with a thief. 
 And I knew my hands were dirty, 
 And I dropped my gaze. 
 Then You said I was forgiven 
 And You welcomed me with laughter. 
 I was happy ever after. 
 I was counting the days 
 When You'd come back again. 
 We'll be waiting for You. 
 When You comin' back again? 
 We'll be ready for You. 
 Maybe we'll wake up when... 
 Maybe we'll wake up when 
 You come back again. 
 Lies. 
 Let's be blunt. 
 We're a little unfaithful. 
 What do You want? 
 Are You still listening? 
 'Cause we're obviously not. 
 We've forgotten our first love. 
 We have lost the plot. 
 And why are You still calling? 
 You forgave, we forgot. 
 We're such experts at stalling 
 That we lost the plot. 
 Lost the plot. 
 When You come back again 
 Would You bring me something from the fridge? 
 Heard a rumor that the end is near 
 But I just got comfortable here.

Like a crimminal guilty on all counts, rattling his cage with every ounce 
 Of resolve he never had, 
 I was convicted. 
 Then I took the pardon 
 And the walls came down, 
 But I must like it here, 
 'Cause I keep hanging around 
 For a better suit, and an escort, 
 And a winning lottery ticket. 
 First we waited for miracles. 
 Then we needed a sign. 
 Now we're here to confess 
 We've wasted the time. 
 But I know, I know, I know, I know that 
 Every blade will wither and fade, 
 As the old man dies again. 
 Seasons pass, we're clinging to grass, 
 'Cause we've lost the sky again. 
 Like a woman trying to give birth, 
 She strains, she labors, 
 She's not sure if it's worth the suffering, 
 As she wonders, "How long?" 
 When I first heard the rumor 
 You were coming back 
 I confess my impatience, 
 I guess I lost track of what 
 I'm to persevere for, 
 Of the reason you put me here for. 
 Remember when it was any day now? 
 Never dreamed we were wrong. 
 Now we're shaking our heads, 
 Wondering, "how long?" 
 But I know, I know, I know, I know that 
 Every blade will wither and fade, 
 As the old man dies again. 
 Seasons pass, we're clinging to grass, 
 'Cause we've lost the sky again. 
 I feel a moment of your perfect love. 
 I catch a glimmer of your sweet grace. 
 But it only makes me long for the day 
 When I'll look full in your face. 
 Every blade will wither and fade, 
 As the old man dies again. 
 Seasons pass, we're clinging to grass, 
 'Cause we've lost the sky again.

Ooh, 18 and I'm outta here 
 She had reached her independence day 
 Never saw her mother's private tears 
 Or the times her daddy prayed to God to see her through 
 Love comes true 
 Love comes true 
 Love comes true 
 Love comes true 
 21 and I'm so confused 
 Getting up her nerve to call collect 
 I do not need help from anyone 
 But there's a few little words I did neglect to say to you 
 Love comes true (No turning back the clock) 
 Love comes true (Just waiting for a knock) 
 Love comes true (Lord, if she only knew) 
 Love comes true 
 Love comes with patience 
 Love lost is found 
 32, married, and kids for her own, she's come around 
 She needs them to help her through 
 Love comes true (Love is sending out a light) 
 Love comes true (Love is gonna make it right) 
 Love comes true (Love is finally getting through) 
 Love comes true 
 Love comes true (Love is sending a light) 
 Love comes true (Love is making it right) 
 Love comes true (Love is gonna get you through) 
 Love comes true 
 Love comes true (Love is sending a light) 
 Love comes true (Love is making it right) 
 Love comes true (Love is gonna get you through) 
 Love comes true 
 Love comes true (Love is sending a light) 
 Love comes true (Love is making it right) 
 Love comes true (Love is gonna get you through) 
 Love comes true

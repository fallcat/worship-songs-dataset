And if I told you there's somebody who loves you 
 Would you say, "Hey, show me that face"? 
 And if I told you that true freedom was actual 
 Would you say, "Hey, take me to that place?" 
 And if I said, "There is a family 
 A body that moves as one" 
 Do you feel the love that invites us, liberty excites us? 
 The disco has just begun, has just begun 
 Give me love, give me liberty disco 
 The place everybody in the family's found 
 On that day we will all be happy people 
 When love liberty disco's in town 
 And as we step into the light of the lover 
 We're all the same, there's no rich or poor 
 And you know it's never been good for a man to be alone 
 So come on in, your name's on the door 
 What are we waiting for? 
 All our fears are turning 'round 
 Fall down, and meet your maker 
 Where our true selves will be found 
 Calling out to every lonely soul

I have, good intentions 
 Don't always turn them, into action 
 I speak love, it's easy enough 
 But words are not what, love is made of 
 I wanna do more than that 
 Yeah, I gotta do more than that 
 Want you to see it 
 And believe it 
 Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, 
 I wanna love like I mean it, love like I mean it 
 Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, 
 I wanna love like I mean it, love like I mean it 
 I know, what mercy feels like 
 I've seen my own life, pulled from the ashes 
 But I'm not gonna wait, until it's too late, too late 
 I wanna show the world what I've been given 
 I could speak with the voice of angels 
 Even tell you that I got your back 
 But I wanna do more than that 
 Yeah, I gotta do more than that

If these streets could talk 
 They'd tell us things 
 Of shattered hearts and wars unseen 
 It's a battle we can't win alone 
 We need saving desperately 
 He made a way, said follow Me 
 Give up your life for something more 
 Oh, what are we waiting for 
 Let's take it around the world 
 We'll start a fight and join the fight 
 In this love riot 
 Oh, ready, set, here we go 
 From London (New York) to Tokyo 
 You gotta unite and 
 Join the fight in this love riot 
 We are an army of the truth 
 We're on the march to rescue you 
 Don't have to make it on your own 
 We're holy rebels and when we yell 
 The mountains fall, the oceans swell 
 This is the time to let them know 
 We'll take to the streets, yeah 
 We'll take to the streets 
 Exploding with love 
 He's already won this, already won this 
 What are we waiting for 
 What are we waiting for

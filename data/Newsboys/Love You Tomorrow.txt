We've walked along a sandy beach 
 I've talked You've listened 
 Sometimes we laughed 
 Sometimes we just enjoyed each other 
 I don't know why You love me 
 I just know it's there 
 Father, Father I have longed to know Your way 
 For You have seen me 
 With emptiness behind my eyes 
 And You will look for me 
 And long to hear me say 
 'Cause I'll love You tomorrow 
 More than today 
 A love that grows stronger 
 In a very special way 
 And when the sands grew deep 
 You carried me to higher ground 
 And we'd rejoice and share the Love 
 That we have deep inside 
 You won't leave me, I won't lose You 
 For our love is never blind 
 For there is nothing in this world 
 That can give me what You can

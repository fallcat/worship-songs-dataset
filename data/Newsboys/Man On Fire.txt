This world is not my home 
 My heart sings a different song 
 I used to act like everybody told me 
 I tried to just fit in 
 But then I met my Savior, and He showed me 
 A new way to live 
 I'm a man on fire 
 Burnin' for the sun 
 I got a light... can't hide it 
 I'm a man on fire 
 Burnin' for the sun 
 Gonna keep on shinin' 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire 
 Don't care - what people say 
 They stare - but I'm not ashamed 
 I used to act like everybody told me 
 I tried to just fit in 
 But then I met my Savior, and He showed me 
 A new way to live 
 I'm a man on fire 
 Burnin' for the sun 
 I got a light... can't hide it 
 I'm a man on fire 
 Burnin' for the sun 
 Gonna keep on shinin' 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire 
 God is a consuming fire 
 He burns away the dark inside 
 He pulled my heart into the light, the light 
 God is a consuming fire 
 He burns away the dark inside 
 He pulled my heart into the light, the light 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire 
 Burnin' for the sun 
 I got a light... can't hide it 
 I'm a man on fire 
 Burnin' for the sun 
 Gonna keep on shinin' 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire 
 I'm a man on fire

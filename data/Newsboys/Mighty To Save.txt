Shine your light and let the whole world see 
 Shine your light and let the whole world see 
 Everyone needs compassion, love that's never failing 
 Let mercy fall on me 
 Everyone needs forgiveness, the kindness of a Saviour 
 The hope of nations 
 Saviour, He can move the mountains 
 My God is mighty to save 
 He is mighty to save 
 Forever, author of salvation 
 He rose and conquered the grave 
 Jesus conquered the grave 
 Shine your light and let the whole world see 
 Shine your light and let the whole world see 
 So take me as you find me - all my fears and failures 
 Fill my life again 
 I give my life to follow everything I believe in 
 Now I surrender 
 We're singing shine your light and let the whole world see 
 We're singing for the glory of the risen King 
 Saviour, He can move the mountains 
 My God is mighty to save 
 He is mighty to save 
 Forever, author of salvation 
 He rose and conquered the grave 
 Jesus conquered the grave 
 We're singing shine your light and let the whole world see 
 We're singing for the glory of the risen king 
 My Saviour, You can move the mountains 
 You are mighty to save 
 You are mighty to save 
 Forever, author of salvation 
 You rose and conquered the grave 
 Oh You conquered the grave 
 Shine your light and let the whole world see 
 We're singing for the glory of the risen King

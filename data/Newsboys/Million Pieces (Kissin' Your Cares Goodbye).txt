Do do doâ€¦. 
 They all fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 Falling from a blue sky 
 Kissin' your cares goodbye, oh 
 They all fall 
 Like a million pieces 
 A tickertape parade high 
 And now you're free to fly 
 Carryin' a millstone malaise 
 It's been puling down your gaze 
 You pound the pavement 
 It don't give or care 
 The weight ain't yours to bear 
 Why you holdin' grudges in old jars? 
 Why you wanna show off all your scars? 
 What's it gonna take to lay a few burdens down? 
 It's a beautiful sound 
 They all fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 Falling from a blue sky 
 Kissin' your cares goodbye, oh 
 They all fall 
 Like a million pieces 
 A tickertape parade high 
 And now you're free to fly 
 When that muffled sigh 
 Says you're barely getting by 
 Cut your burdens loose and just simplify 
 Simplify 
 This is not your floor 
 You're going higher than before 
 Drop the weight now 
 Wait for the lookout guide 
 Look outside 
 They all fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 Falling from a blue sky 
 Kissin' your cares goodbye, oh 
 They all fall 
 Like a million pieces 
 A tickertape parade high 
 And now you're free to fly 
 You've gotta lay that burden down 
 You've gotta lay that burden down 
 It's time to leave your burdens in a pyre 
 Set a bonfire 
 'Cause when you lay your burdens down 
 When you drop them burdens 
 What a free-fall 
 What a thrill 
 Bury them all 
 In a landfill 
 They all fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 Falling from a blue sky 
 Kissin' your cares goodbye, oh 
 They all fall 
 Like a million pieces 
 A tickertape parade high 
 And now you're free to fly 
 Oh they all fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 Falling from a blue sky 
 Kissin' your cares goodbye, oh 
 They all fall 
 Like a million pieces 
 A tickertape parade high 
 And now you're free to fly 
 They all fall 
 Like a million raindrops 
 Falling from a blue sky 
 Kissin' your cares goodbye, oh 
 They all fall 
 Like a million pieces

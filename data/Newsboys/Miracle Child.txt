When you got there 
 I was sure you'd come too late 
 We all paid you lip service 
 Than address our prayers to fate 
 Sister gone 
 She tripped and fell 
 A prodigal hell 
 And do I dare believe you'll reach 
 Such a long lost cause 
 Wrapped in gauze 
 As good as dead 
 She's breathing... 
 My lord 
 She's a miracle child 
 I know 
 She's a miracle child 
 I saw 
 How she'd chosen the grave 
 My lord 
 It's a miracle save 
 When she woke up 
 We were dumbstruck at the sight 
 Like coming out of a coma 
 All she asked for was more light 
 Fluttering eyes 
 Life from a tomb 
 You flooded her room 
 With a fearsome mercy 
 Torn from the devils grip 
 From the clutches of fear 
 I can hear her dead heart beating 
 We lose hope 
 We mumble our prayers 
 We seal off the stairs 
 And never dare believe your reach 
 Can pass through stone 
 Can lead a child home 
 Can make the dead start blinking

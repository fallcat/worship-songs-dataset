You ever seen a brother or sister who could cure a disease 
 I hadn't but I wanted to 
 Show the world that nothing's impossible if they can believe 
 They're gonna see a miracle 
 I didn't know what to do 
 So I went running to you 
 To find that cure 
 Now I know for sure... 
 I'm done looking around 
 I finally figured it out 
 It's more than metaphysical 
 You got me up from down 
 Faith has shattered my doubts 
 I believe in miracles 
 I knew what I wanted to do but just like gravity's pull 
 I always did the opposite 
 Life was a meaningless party 
 I started to fall into a bottomless hole 
 But then I got a miracle 
 Some people don't have a clue 
 If all of this could be true 
 But take a look at me 
 I was blind but now I see 
 I'm done looking around 
 I finally figured it out 
 It's more than metaphysical 
 You got me up from down 
 Faith has shattered my doubts 
 I believe in miracles 
 There's something that's missing 
 If we can't recognize 
 That our own existence 
 Is the miracle before our eyes 
 I'm done looking around 
 I finally figured it out 
 It's more than metaphysical 
 You got me up from down 
 Faith has shattered my doubts 
 I believe in miracles 
 I'm done looking around 
 I finally figured it out 
 It's more than metaphysical 
 You got me up from down 
 Faith has shattered my doubts 
 I believe in miracles 
 It's more than metaphysical

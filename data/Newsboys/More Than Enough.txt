Child of promise sent from heaven 
 Light from light shine down to us 
 Oh to fill a hungry people 
 Child of promise, child of God 
 You are faithful, You are savior 
 You are more than enough 
 You are healer, You are holy 
 You are more than enough 
 Man of sorrows, heart of mercy 
 Love raised high upon a cross 
 Dead to lead us to redemption 
 Man of sorrows, Son of God 
 Lord of life in glory risen 
 Love has conquered both sin and grave 
 Heaven's gates are truly open 
 Lord of life, King of Kings 
 I'm alive in the arms of love 
 I lift my hands to the God above

I bought a product they should not have sold. 
 I called the help line, 
 They put me on hold 
 I've been waiting for an hour 
 Now my phone's losing power 
 And I'm gonna explode. 
 I hear, "How may I help you today?" 
 I know a very rude answer, 
 But I'm wondering, hey 
 What if everybody talked like my friend Jesus? 
 If everybody loved like my friend Jesus, 
 If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus, 
 It would give the world a new beginning. 
 What if this is like an early inning? 
 I state my business; 
 She puts me on hold. 
 I'm back to thinking; 
 I'm gonna explode. 
 And the dog wants dinner, 
 And the music they're playing 
 Is the sound-track of hell. 
 You say, "Two wrongs don't make a right?" 
 Just try listening to Celine Dion all night. 
 But if everybody talked like my friend Jesus, 
 If everybody loved like my friend Jesus, 
 If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus, 
 If we want to mend world relations 
 Surely I can show a little patience. 
 I've been waiting around for this world to change. 
 Another day cut loose, another lame excuse. 
 I've got the why and how to start here and now... 
 ...Then my cellphone drops the call. 
 ...And I spew out vitriol. 
 ...And as my fist goes through the wall, a voice says, "Be the change you wanna see!" 
 'Cause if everybody talked like my friend Jesus? 
 If everybody loved like my friend Jesus, 
 If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus, 
 What a changed world this could be 
 If everybody talked like my friend Jesus? 
 If everybody loved like my friend Jesus, 
 If everyone forgave like my friend Jesus, 
 What a changed world this could be 
 Starting now, Maybe I can start the change in me.

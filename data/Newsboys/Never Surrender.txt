Put on the armor you've got the sword 
 Prepare to fight for you've got the final word 
 The power of darkness is pushing in 
 They call it fashion but it's known as sin 
 The Evil One knows all too well 
 Gives you the world but you burn in hell 
 The Lord is with you for ever more 
 The power of God always wins the war 
 He can give the power to make it through 
 He gives us the strength, He cares for you 
 Chorus twice 
 Never surrender, never say die, never, never 
 Jesus won the battle for you and I 
 Never surrender never say die, never, never 
 Jesus won the battle for you and I 
 You've got the power don't be ashamed 
 You gotta stand up for the name of Jesus 
 Can't be defeated he's breaking through 
 The power of God is coming down on you 
 A change is coming. it's in the air 
 Stand up and shout He's coming back again 
 We've got the fire it's in our hearts 
 The hand of God will show you the way 
 Repeat bridge

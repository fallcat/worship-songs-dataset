Lay my body down on Mercy Street 
 Or deep beneath the darkest seas 
 Lay my body six feet under down in Old 
 Noarlunga 
 Right beneath the ghost gum trees 
 Doesn't matter where 
 You won't find me there 
 No grave 
 Gonna hold my spirit down 
 Ain't no grave 
 Hold my spirit down 
 Lord knows they'll never keep me in the ground 
 Ain't no grave 
 Hold my spirit down 
 It's all right mama, now don't be sad 
 It's all right, don't cry for me 
 They can lock my flesh and bones up until kingdom come 
 But my spirit will be free 
 It doesn't matter where 
 You won't find me there 
 It's a dead end search 
 It's a nowhere thread 
 Looking for the living down among the dead 
 No devil in hell 
 No angel above 
 Can separate the saints from the love of God

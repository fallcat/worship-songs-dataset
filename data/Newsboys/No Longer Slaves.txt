You unravel me with a melody 
 You surround me with a song 
 Of deliverance, from my enemies 
 Till all my fears are gone 
 I'm no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I'm no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 From my mother's womb 
 You have chosen me 
 Love has called my name 
 I've been born again, into Your family 
 Your blood flows through my veins 
 I'm no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 I'm no longer a slave to fear 
 I am a child of God 
 You split the sea 
 So I could walk right through it 
 My fears were drowned in perfect love 
 You rescued me 
 So I could stand and sing 
 I am a child of God 
 I am a child of God

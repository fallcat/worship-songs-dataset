We live a life 
 Day by day 
 A walk of faith 
 Not by sight 
 We generate, permeate 
 Close the gate 
 On the dirty devil 
 The day will come 
 When we are told 
 If we are righteous 
 By the Lord of old 
 A sacrifice complete in Him 
 We're here today 
 But we're gone tomorrow 
 We will not be silent 
 We will not stand alone 
 We will not be silent 
 We will not stand alone 
 All God's people 
 Hand in hand 
 Divided we fall 
 United we stand 
 Your Kingdom come 
 Thy will be done 
 Here on earth 
 Like it is in heaven 
 Heaven and earth will pass away 
 But Your Word 
 Will stand forever 
 Eternal life is in our reach 
 Eternal hell is not that funny

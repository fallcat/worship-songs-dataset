Let love explode and bring the dead to life 
 A love so bold 
 To see a revolution somehow 
 Let love explode and bring the dead to life 
 A love so bold 
 To bring a revolution somehow 
 Now I'm lost in Your freedom 
 In this world I'll overcome 
 My God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 Roaring, He's roaring, He's roaring like a lion 
 Let hope arise and make the darkness hide 
 My faith is dead I need resurrection somehow 
 Now I'm lost in Your freedom 
 In this world I'll overcome 
 My God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 Roaring, He's roaring, He's roaring like a lion 
 He's roaring, He's roaring 
 Let heaven roar and fire fall 
 Come shake the ground 
 With the sound of revival 
 Let heaven roar and fire fall 
 Come shake the ground 
 With the sound of revival 
 Let heaven roar (Let heaven roar) and fire fall 
 Come shake the ground 
 With the sound of revival 
 (My God's not dead) 
 (He's surely alive) 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 God's not dead 
 He's surely alive 
 He's living on the inside 
 Roaring like a lion 
 He's roaring, He's roaring, He's roaring like a lion 
 He's roaring, He's roaring, He's roaring like a lion (Roaring like a lion)

Lately, she's been thinking what her daddy said 
 How when you're winning, you got more friends 
 But are they your friends if you fall they're gone? 
 Something about those kind of people seems wrong 
 Who's gonna be there when the phone call knocks her down? 
 All of the steeples but she can't hear a bell sound 
 Jumps on a bus to head downtown 
 And picks up the paper that's been blowing around, it says 
 When your heart breaks, He'll hurt for you 
 Dreams are out of reach, He'll pull you through 
 When you lose hope all you gotta do 
 Is get on your knees again 
 Not long now and you're gonna see 
 No mountain's too high for you or for me 
 Or fall too far if you can believe 
 And get on your knees, on your knees again 
 She folds up the paper and puts it in her bag 
 Knows she really needs a savior like that 
 Walking past her church just up the street 
 Says, "Maybe it's time to get on my knees" 
 'Cause He was there when no one was around 
 All of the people but no one made a sound 
 Thinks of her brother who's been feeling down 
 Pulls out the paper and reads it aloud 
 When your heart breaks, He'll hurt for you 
 Dreams are out of reach, He'll pull you through 
 When you lose hope all you gotta do is 
 Get on your knees again 
 Not long now and you're gonna see 
 No mountain's too high for you or for me 
 Or fall too far if you can believe 
 And get on your knees, on your knees again 
 You've given everything you've got 
 Still it's hard to believe 
 Love comes from the inside out 
 If you wanna be free 
 Ya gotta give your love and never stop 
 When you think about giving up 
 Get on your knees 
 When your heart breaks, He'll hurt for you 
 Dreams are out of reach, He'll pull you through 
 When you lose hope all you gotta do is 
 Get on your knees again 
 Not long now and you're gonna see 
 No mountain's too high for you or for me 
 Or fall too far if you can believe 
 And get on your knees, on your knees again 
 On your knees again, on your knees again 
 When you've giving everything you've got 
 Ya gotta give your love and never stop

Shipwrecked on the rocks of pride. 
 Shipwrecked on the rocks of fear. 
 My heart is torn apart when you're not here. 
 Life goes by like a dream. 
 When we die, oh will it seem 
 That our hearts weren't always on the One? 
 One heart, one mind, one soul. 
 One heart, one mind, one soul. 
 One heart after You. 
 There are hearts undecided. 
 Some are hard and subdivided. 
 A hard heart couldn't break the chains on me. 
 Let me plow up the ground. 
 Make it so I can see. 
 I want to grow. I want Your love in me. 
 One heart, one mind, one soul. 
 One heart, one mind, one soul. 
 One heart after You. 
 One heart, one mind, one soul. 
 (One heart after You.) 
 One heart, one mind, one soul. 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. 
 Well I was shipwrecked on the rocks, the rock of pride. 
 Slowly and surely, in came the tide. 
 Life goes by like a dream. 
 When we die, oh will is seem 
 That our life was wasted by the things we tasted? 
 Wake up, wally, it's time to face it. 
 Lifting Jesus up makes me feel up. 
 One heart, one mind, one soul.

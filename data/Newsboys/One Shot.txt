All around the world 
 Every boy, every girl's got one shot 
 Believers, let me hear you shout 
 Hey, hey 
 You could find me living in the city of D.C. 
 Found my freedom in the rhythm of the back beat 
 Got placed to love inside 
 That I could not control 
 Beside me, had a brother saying I could sing like Nat King 
 But all I wanted was to do the rock thing 
 To roll through every town 
 And spread His love around 
 Just a little while then I found 
 All around the world, every boy, every girl's 
 Got one shot to prove what they're all about 
 I'm gonna sing about my God and it doesn't matter what's hot 
 Believers, let me hear you shout 
 We say there's one way 
 When push comes to shove we're gonna sing of His love 
 Things change just like the Twitter that you update 
 Or your Facebook status on your front page 
 But there's no comment you can leave to change my mind 
 Maybe you're a student at the college of the Ivy 
 Or filling up a pop machine with Hi-C 
 Anywhere you might be you can help the world see 
 What His love's about 
 Believers, let me hear you shout 
 All around the world every boy, every girl's 
 Got one shot to prove what they're all about 
 I'm gonna sing about my God and it doesn't matter what's hot 
 Believers, let me hear you shout 
 We say there's one way when push comes to shove 
 We're gonna sing of His love 
 Are we scared to stand out from the crowd? 
 Make a difference in our own town? 
 If we stay silent with our voices now 
 The rocks will cry out 
 Believers, let me hear you shout 
 All around the world every boy, every girl's 
 Got one shot to prove what they're all about 
 I'm gonna sing about my God and it doesn't matter what's hot 
 Believers, let me hear you shout 
 We say there's one way when push comes to shove 
 We're gonna sing of His love 
 All around the world 
 Every boy and girl 
 All around the world 
 Every boy and girl 
 All around the world

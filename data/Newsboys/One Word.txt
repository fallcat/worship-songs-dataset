When You breathe a spark of light into the void 
 The shadows ran away from Your voice 
 In the darkness now, I'm falling to my knees 
 Will You speak that same voice to me? 
 From emptiness, You speak life 
 Defeating fear, every time 
 I hear Your voice, it whispers my name 
 And all at once, You quiet my pain 
 If Your voice lit the sun, and night was overcome 
 You can speak and light up my world, with just one word 
 At Your voice, the blind begin to see 
 And the lame can walk, the captives are set free 
 A heart-in-heart can finally start to feel 
 Will You speak that same voice to me? 
 From ashes, Lord, You make beauty 
 You make me new when You speak to me 
 I hear Your voice, it whispers my name 
 And all at once, You quiet my pain 
 If Your voice lit the sun, and night was overcome 
 You can speak and light up my world, with just one word 
 The stone rolled away 
 With just one word 
 You conquered the grave 
 'Cause when You speak 
 The dead are raised 
 So here I am 
 On my face 
 I hear Your voice, it whispers my name 
 And all at once, You quiet my pain 
 If Your voice lit the sun, and night was overcome 
 You can speak and light up my world, with just one word

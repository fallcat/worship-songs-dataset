Livin' in this world 
 Can be like a desert 
 It can leave me dry and alone 
 Lookin' for safety 
 Runnin' on empty 
 Takin' all I have to go on 
 But You, You fill up my cup and I'm overwhelmed 
 Yeah You, You give me a Hope that never ends 
 There's no limit to the love that You give me 
 I go swimming in a sea of forgiveness 
 I know You're the only reason I'm livin'... I overflow 
 I overflow... I overflow 
 I overflow... I overflow 
 The love that I'm filled with 
 I can't help but give it 
 I wanna see joy flood this world 
 Watch all the nations 
 Return to their Savior 
 Bringing heaven down to this earth 
 But You, You fill up my cup and I'm overwhelmed 
 Yeah You, You give me a Hope that never ends 
 There's no limit to the love that You give me 
 I go swimming in a sea of forgiveness 
 I know You're the only reason I'm livin'... I overflow 
 I overflow... I overflow 
 I overflow... I overflow 
 It's over the top 
 Your love never stops 
 Rushin' through my heart 
 I can't contain 
 I get carried away 
 In all that You are 
 It's over the top 
 Your love never stops 
 Rushin' through my heart 
 I can't contain 
 I get carried away 
 In all that You are 
 There's no limit to the love that You give me 
 I go swimming in a sea of forgiveness 
 I know You're the only reason I'm livin'... I overflow 
 I overflow... I overflow 
 I overflow... I overflow

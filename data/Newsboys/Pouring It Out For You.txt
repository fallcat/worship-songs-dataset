O for grace to trust 
 O for strength to love 
 O to cast my cares down at your feet 
 O for feet to dance 
 O for a heart to romance 
 O for lungs to lift your name so high 
 My hands go up, giving you glory 
 I just can't get enough 
 You are so worthy, Lord 
 I'll keep pouring it out for you 
 My cup is overflowing 
 With your perfect love 
 You're all I'm longing for 
 I'll keep pouring it out for you 
 O for faith to rise 
 O my soul come alive 
 O my God You are all I need 
 O for feet to dance 
 O for a heart to romance 
 O for lungs to lift your name so high 
 My heart and flesh they cry out holy 
 Jesus be my one and only joy

Like a moth drawn to the flame 
 I am drawn to the mighty name of Jesus 
 Like a deer that pants for water 
 My heart cries out to You to fill my life with all of You 
 It's You I want to strengthen me 
 For all the days of my life 
 How could I have ever lived without Your precious love 
 How could I expect to carry on 
 You give love that soothes fire that burns within my soul 
 And You will always send it 'round my way 
 Through a shadow will pass away 
 Your love for me will stand the test of time 
 When You fill me with Your water 
 My hands reach out to You to touch my life with all of You 
 It's You I want to strengthen me 
 For all the days of my life 
 Lord, I pledge the highest 
 The highest that can be from a heart 
 It's You I want to strengthen me 
 For all the days of my life

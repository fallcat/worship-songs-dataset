Some kissed the girls, I kissed the floor 
 The Bover boys with their boots shiny red 
 Three dollar champagne stirring my head 
 We rolled out the barrels, boys 
 We sang with a single voice 
 Let all tears turn to gold 
 And all the hell I've raised 
 Lord, let it fade away 
 As Your glories unfold 
 Give me a part to play 
 Grant me another day 
 The surf and the sky and the Sunshine Coast of gold 
 Floating on a long board, life on hold 
 I never know the way, but you always take me there 
 And I need it now, like the Mooloolaba air 
 We'll roll with the next wave, boys 
 We'll sing out, we'll make some noise 
 Let all tears turn to gold 
 And all the hell I've raised 
 Lord, let it fade away 
 As Your glories unfold 
 Give me a part to play 
 Grant me another day 
 Red dust rises 
 Clouds your every thought 
 You don't know you're deceived until you're not 
 Good dog, bad dog - they get to fightin' in your head 
 The winner is the last one gettin' fed 
 God is alive and my magic is no good 
 And He's called me out on this walkabout 
 He leads me to water and traces each song line 
 And I know to know His ways are higher than mine 
 So roll out the road rig, boys 
 We'll sing with a grateful voice 
 Let all tears turn to gold 
 And the hell that's raised 
 Lord, let it fade away 
 As Your glories unfold 
 Give us a part to play 
 Grant us another day 
 Let all tears turn to gold 
 And all the hell I've raised 
 Lord, let it fade away 
 As Your glories unfold 
 Give me a part to play 
 Grant me another day

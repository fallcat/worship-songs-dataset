I get my head together on a Saturday morning 
 A victim of the night it's called social action 
 I'm just trying to keep up with the times 
 Moving with the crowd and they want it loud 
 I keep saying I'll never do it again 
 Same old line I'm right back out there again 
 You can read all about it 
 You can read all about it 
 You can read all about it 
 You can read all about it 
 My eyes catch the morning paper on hte table 
 It's a brand new day but nothing's changed 
 Sickness crime and poverty are the headlines 
 I can see the world through different eyes now 
 Peace love and harmony 
 The Bible says these are good for me 
 I thank God for the good news today

When we don't get what we deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 When we get what we don't deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 Born to sin and then get caught 
 All our good deeds, don't mean squat 
 Sell the Volvo, shred the Visa 
 Send the cash to Ma Theresa 
 Great idea, the only catch is 
 You don't get saved on merit badges 
 When we don't get what we deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 When we get what we don't deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 Doctor's coming, looking grim 
 "Do you have a favorite hymn?" 
 Check your balance through the years 
 All accounts are in arrears 
 Guilt is bitter, grace is sweet 
 Park it here on the mercy seat 
 When we don't get what we deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 When we get what we don't deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 When we don't get what we deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 When we get what we don't deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 When we don't get what we deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing 
 When we get what we don't deserve 
 That's a real good thing, a real good thing

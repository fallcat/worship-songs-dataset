Mom and Dad 
 I'm fine, how are you? 
 I have joined a small circus 
 That much is true 
 I'm a little malnourished 
 But try to relax 
 Could you find a better photo 
 For the milk carton backs? 
 Send money 
 Runaway 
 Where's your head? 
 Dreamer's dreams 
 Are grounded 
 In reality that comes from above 
 God is calling 
 There's no bigger love 
 It's his reality that welcomes us back 
 Trust and obey 
 There is no other way 
 Mom and Dad 
 I am fair, how's life? 
 Lent the money you sent me 
 To a clown with a knife 
 My career as an acrobat 
 Hasn't begun 
 But I'm busy giving blood 
 And shoveling elephant dung 
 Send money 
 Runaway 
 Why so tense? 
 Dreamer's dreams 
 Will make sense 
 In reality that comes from above 
 God is calling 
 There's no bigger love 
 It's his reality that welcomes us back 
 Trust and obey 
 There is no other way 
 Runaway 
 Blowing smoke 
 Your folks are worried 
 And going broke 
 After the fall 
 Is a whole new episode 
 Reality is a high road 
 In the reality that comes from above 
 God is calling 
 There's no bigger love 
 His reality will welcome us back 
 Trust and obey 
 There is no other way 
 In the reality that comes from above 
 God is calling 
 There's no bigger love 
 His reality will welcome us back 
 Trust and obey 
 There is no other way 
 In the reality that comes from above 
 God is calling 
 There's no bigger love 
 His reality will welcome us back 
 Trust and obey 
 There is no other way 
 In the reality that comes from above 
 God is calling

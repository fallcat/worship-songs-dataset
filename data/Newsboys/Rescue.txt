Old as the hills, new everyday 
 It's in the bones like it's DNA 
 First taste is sweet till it rots in your mouth 
 Another old friends who rats you out 
 All of the time in this life 
 Can't loose the ties that bind 
 They shackle our feet, we trip, we fall 
 We crawl 
 I was born in the mess of it all 
 Then you rescued me, rescued me 
 Lord, with a touch of your hand 
 Another captive free again 
 Who else in heaven could do this but you? 
 You rescued me, rescued me 
 Lord, with a love out of mind 
 Oh, you know I love it when 
 Everyday I am rescued again 
 Over the years your nature's way 
 Is turning wrongs into roles you play 
 Caught in a spell that's overcast 
 You gain perspective, it doesn't last 
 All of the time in this life 
 Can't loose the ties that blind you 
 They're new everyday, old as the fall 
 The fall 
 And I was born in the mess of it all 
 Every day, every way, every 
 Every cheap imitation 
 All of my imagination 
 Even my self-preservation 
 Is yours in time 
 Then you rescued me, rescued me 
 Lord, with a touch of your hand 
 Another captive free again 
 Everyday I am rescued again 
 Again

 Oh Yeah 
 Oh Yeah 
 Oh Yeah 
 Oh Yeah 
 Oh Yeah 
 Oh Yeah ...

I was finished, game over 
 Couldn't carry the weight on my shoulders 
 At my end, in trouble 
 Knocked down on the ground seein' double 
 But then Your love, love opened my eyes 
 Lifted me up, up, now I'm alive 
 I raise my hands, hands to the sky 
 Singing "Oh oh oh oh oh oh" "Oh oh oh oh oh" 
 Oh Lord, I'm a different man 
 You gave me a second chance 
 I was lost, I was fallin' apart 
 But You came along, and You hit the restart 
 You, You, You hit the restart 
 You, You, You hit the restart 
 You, You, You hit the restart 
 You came along, and You hit the restart 
 I was twisted, like bad religion 
 Fully committed to my way of livin' 
 I heard the preacher, but never listened 
 I lied dead in the road without a mission 
 Restart, Restart, Oh Oh Oh 
 Restart, Restart, Oh Oh Oh 
 I was lost, I was fallin' apart 
 But You came along, and You hit the restart 
 You make all things new 
 That's just what You do 
 You're making me new

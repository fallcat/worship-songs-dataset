Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain 
 Holy holy is He 
 Sing a new song, to Him who sits on 
 Heaven's mercy seat 
 Holy holy holy 
 Is the Lord God Almighty 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 With all creation I sing 
 Praise to the King of kings 
 You are my everything, and I will adore You 
 Clothed in rainbows of living color 
 Flashes of lightning 
 Rolls of thunder 
 Blessing and honor 
 Strength and glory 
 And power be to You 
 The only wise King 
 Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder 
 At the mention of Your name

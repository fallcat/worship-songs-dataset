Somebody told me about a place, oh, I can see it 
 But I've got to change my ways 
 Day after day it's the same old thing I keep repeating 
 The reason I stay this way 
 I know what I have to do 
 Get back to what I know is true 
 When everything is broken there's a door wide open 
 You'll find me running through 
 More than just emotion, my broken heart has chosen 
 Jesus, I'm running to You, I'm running to You 
 I'm running, running to You 
 I'm running, running to You 
 I can see the tear on your face, you feel defeated 
 Wondering what are you living for 
 Selfish dreams left you time and time, empty-handed 
 There's got to be something more 
 You know what you have to do 
 Get back to who you know is true 
 When everything is broken there's a door wide open 
 You'll find me running through 
 More than just emotion, my broken heart has chosen 
 Jesus, I'm running to You, I'm running to You 
 You're the only one 
 Who can fix what I've become 
 Oh God, I believe in Your love 
 When everything is broken there's a door wide open 
 You'll find me running to You 
 More than just emotion, my broken heart has chosen 
 Jesus, I'm running to You, I'm running to You 
 I'm running to You, I'm running to You 
 I'm running, running to You 
 I'm running, running to You 
 I'm running to You

Dear friend, you been trying again, doing whatever it takes to fit in 
 Falling for the lies of the world 
 You tell me you'd pay anything just to not hurt 
 What you want, I ain't got, what I have, can't be bought 
 There's something better I can give, if you surrender, you will live 
 Just got to taste and see it's good 
 I'd make you see it if I could 
 Gonna save your life, gonna save your life 
 Dear friend, I'd be lying to you 
 If I told you each road that we 
 Traveled would be smooth 
 Sometimes you just wanna give up 
 Trying and trying 
 But nothing is ever enough 
 Chasing things, what for? 
 You've seen it all but want more 
 There's something better I can give, if you surrender, you will live 
 Just got to taste and see it's good 
 I'd make you see it if I could 
 Gonna save your life, gonna save your life 
 I can see now you want this 
 And you know that you need this 
 Get away from the darkness 
 Get away from the darkness 
 I can see now you want this 
 And you know that you need this 
 Get away from the darkness 
 Got to know who Christ is 
 There's something better I can give 
 If you surrender you will live 
 Just got to taste and see it's good 
 I'd make you see it if I could 
 It's gonna save your life 
 It's gonna save your life 
 It's gonna save your life 
 It's gonna save your life, it's gonna, it's gonna save your life

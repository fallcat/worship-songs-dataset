God so loved, that He gave His son 
 To lay down His life for the sake of us 
 He bore the weight of our sin and shame 
 With a cry He said, It is finished 
 Christ the Lord overcame the darkness 
 He's alive: death has been defeated 
 For He made us a way 
 By which we have been saved 
 He's the Savior of the world 
 So we lift up a shout for his fame and renown 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Jesus, Saviour of the world 
 We must spread the word of His soon return 
 To reclaim the world for His glory 
 Let the church now sing of this coming King 
 Crowned with majesty, our Redeemer 
 And He reigns, ruler of the heavens 
 And His name is Jesus, the Messiah 
 Christ the Lord overcame the darkness 
 He's alive: death has been defeated 
 And He reigns, ruler of the heavens 
 And His name is Jesus, the Messiah

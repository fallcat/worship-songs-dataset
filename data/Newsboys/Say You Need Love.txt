You've been looking for shelter 
 On a cloudless day, there's no rain 
 You're keeping pennies in your pocket 
 For a bottle full of spare change, just in case 
 And if the glass ain't half empty then it's broken 
 It helps you escape from the pain 
 You throw the baby with the bath water 
 Over and over again, turn the page 
 You say you need love (Tell me where does that get you?) 
 When push comes to shove (Who you gonna run to?) 
 Turn your eyes up above (He unconditionally loves you) 
 Nothing you can say or do 
 Will change his love for you 
 Heard it said you're an accident 
 Biological mistake 
 So you're a love child, who could say it better 
 A physical grace, a perfect display 
 You say you need love (Tell me where does that get you?) 
 When push comes to shove (Who you gonna run to?) 
 Turn your eyes up above (He unconditionally loves you) 
 Nothing you can say or do 
 Will change his love for you 
 Has someone you trusted left you betrayed 
 Has someone who loved you thrown love away 
 Do you see God? does he have a face? 
 Looks like your father's, how does it relate? 
 You're scared of being let down, tell me 
 Don't be afraid, don't shy away 
 He'll never leave you, he won't forsake 
 Don't be afraid, don't shy away 
 He's not gonna leave you 
 You say you need love (Tell me where does that get you?) 
 When push comes to shove (Who you gonna run to?) 
 Turn your eyes up above (He unconditionally loves you) 
 Nothing you can say or do 
 Will change his love for you 
 You say you need love (Tell me where does that get you?) 
 When push comes to shove (Who you gonna run to?) 
 Turn your eyes up above (He unconditionally loves you) 
 Nothing you can say or do 
 Will change his love for you 
 You say you need love (Tell me where does that get you?) 
 When push comes to shove (Who you gonna run to?) 
 Turn your eyes up above (He unconditionally loves you) 
 Nothing you can say or do 
 Will change his love for you

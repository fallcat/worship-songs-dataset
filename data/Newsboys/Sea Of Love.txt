All these emotions I go through 
 I am so in love with you 
 True love has caught my heart 
 Girl its more than a feeling 
 True love has come ' Wo oh 
 And swept me away 
 The big sea of love 
 We're together forever 
 You have my heart 
 You touch me each day 
 You are daughter of Sarah 
 I never knew why God blessed me 
 With a woman like you 
 But now I know His hand's on me 
 And He knew I needed you 
 I will always treasure you 
 You are there when I need you 
 It is love that will prevail 
 And stand the test of time

Go album version: 
 This here comes breakin' in 
 Like brick to glass 
 Like grace to sin 
 Gonna kick down walls like West Berlin 
 Shout an amen 
 Hug it out, then 
 This here's gonna light a fire 
 Gonna pink slip preaching to the choir 
 Gonna send us hobbits outta the shire 
 Here's the theme song 
 Get your ring on 
 That there's still propagating, waiting on a rooftop 
 Our journey's just begun... 
 Oh, come here, a little bit closer 
 I wanna take you to a secret kingdom 
 It's here spinning our world around 
 Turn it upside down 
 This here is bigger than show biz 
 It's gonna show us what the good news really is 
 This here is spinning our world around 
 'Til we've got no fear 
 This here won't be contained 
 By culture, wars and trendy names 
 Been there, done that, wore out the t-shirts 
 Don't need free perks 
 Don't need knee jerks 
 This here still wakes the dead 
 Still gets God's people Spirit-led 
 Gonna put in action all we've read 
 Not all enraged, just all engaged 
 'Cause that there's still fabricating kingdoms out of boxes 
 We're gonna leave that slum 
 Oh, come here, a little bit closer 
 I wanna take you to a secret kingdom 
 It's here spinning our world around 
 Turn it upside down 
 This here is bigger than show biz 
 It's gonna show us what the good news really is 
 This here is spinning our world around 
 'Til we've got no fear 
 This here wants faithfulness, not easy fixes 
 This here won't shrink to fit no politics, yeah 
 This here knows whistles make for better mixes 
 Come here, a little bit closer 
 I wanna take you to a secret kingdom 
 It's here spinning our world around 
 Turn it upside down 
 This here is bigger than show biz 
 It's gonna show us what the good news really is 
 This here is spinning our world around 
 'Til we've got no fear 
 Come here, a little bit closer 
 I wanna take you to a secret kingdom 
 It's here spinning our world around 
 Turn it upside down 
 This here is bigger than show biz 
 It's gonna show us what the good news really is 
 This here is spinning our world around

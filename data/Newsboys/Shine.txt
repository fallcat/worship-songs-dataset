Dull as dirt 
 You can't assert the kind of light 
 That might persuade 
 A strict dictator to retire 
 Fire the army 
 Teach the poor origami 
 The truth is in 
 The proof is when 
 You hear your heart 
 Start asking, "What's my motivation?" 
 And try as you may, there isn't a way 
 To explain the kind of change 
 That would make an Eskimo renounce fur 
 That would make a vegetarian barbecue hamster 
 Unless you can trace this about-face 
 To a certain sign... 
 Shine 
 Make 'em wonder what  you've got 
 Make 'em wish that they were not 
 On the outside looking bored 
 Shine 
 Let it shine before all men 
 Let 'em see good works and then 
 Let 'em glorify the Lord 
 Out of the shaker and onto 
 The plate 
 It isn't Karma 
 It sure ain't fate 
 That would make a Deadhead sell his van 
 That would make a schizophrenic turn in his crayons 
 Oprah freaks 
 And science seeks a rationale 
 That shall excuse 
 This strange behavior 
 When you let it shine 
 You will inspire 
 The kind of entire turnaround 
 That would make a bouncer take ballet 
 (Even bouncers who aren't...happy) 
 But out of the glare 
 With nowhere to turn 
 You ain't gonna learn it on 
 "What's My Line?" 
 Shine 
 Make 'em wonder what  you've got 
 Make 'em wish that they were not 
 On the outside looking bored 
 Shine 
 Let it shine before all men 
 Let 'em see good works and then 
 Let 'em glorify the Lord 
 Shineâ€¦. 
 Shine 
 Make 'em wonder what  you've got

 Let 'em see good works and then 
 Let 'em glorify the Lord

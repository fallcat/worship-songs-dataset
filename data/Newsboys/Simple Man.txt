There has been a time 
 When the rains did fall 
 I could see the clouds 
 As they started to form 
 I have lived my life as a simple man 
 Should my heart not make a sound 
 I've even tried to please the other man 
 Storing riches for my own 
 I have seen the fire 
 I have felt the flames 
 It seemed warm for a while 
 Then it started to burn

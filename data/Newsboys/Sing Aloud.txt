It's a funny thing getting a song from the Lord 
 You feel His power and the revelation flow 
 Then there are people who tell you it's not cool 
 To mention Jesus or lift up His name 
 Newsboys will sing aloud 
 Sing unto the King of kings 
 Newsboys will dance, dance, dance 
 Before the Lord 
 Don't matter what the magazines have said before 
 What they say carries no weight in heaven 
 There's only one God we aim to please 
 And that's our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ 
 And so these people talk like there's nothing in His name 
 The unsaved will only turn away (that's what they say) 
 I know they can't be talking 'bout my Jesus 
 Because there's power, power in His name

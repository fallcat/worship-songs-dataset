Go album version: 
 I wanna start it over 
 I wanna start again 
 I want a new beginning 
 One without an end 
 I feel it inside 
 Calling out to me 
 It's a voice that whispers my name 
 It's a kiss without any shame 
 Something beautiful, yeah, yeah 
 Like a song that stirs in my head 
 Singing love will take us where 
 Something's beautiful 
 I've heard it in the silence 
 Seen it on a face 
 I've felt it in a long hour 
 Like a sweet embrace 
 I know this is true 
 It's calling out to me 
 It's a voice that whispers my name 
 It's a kiss without any shame 
 Something beautiful, yeah, yeah 
 Like a song that stirs in my head 
 Singing love will take us where 
 Something's beautiful 
 It's the child on her wedding day 
 It's the daddy that gives her away 
 Something beautiful, yeah, yeah 
 When we laugh so hard we cry 
 Oh the love between you and I 
 Something beautiful 
 It's a voice that whispers my name 
 It's a kiss without any shame 
 Something beautiful, yeah, yeah 
 Like a song that stirs in my head 
 Singing love will take us where 
 Something's beautiful 
 It's the child on her wedding day 
 It's the daddy that gives her away -- Father 
 Something beautiful 
 When we laugh so hard we cry 
 It's the love between You and I 
 Something beautiful 
 Something beautiful

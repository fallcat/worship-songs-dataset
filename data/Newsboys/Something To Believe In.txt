Our land 
 Our shore 
 Waits for 
 Somethin' to believe in 
 White skies 
 White seas 
 Bring us please 
 Somethin' to believe in 
 Stirrin' below 
 Starting to grow 
 Is a world full of colors 
 We can barely remember 
 (On the move again) 
 Stirrin' below 
 Pushing through snow 
 There is life, wild life 
 Comin' back from December 
 Fogs lift 
 Crowds yearn 
 Our turn 
 For somethin' to believe in 
 Ice melts 
 Streams flow 
 All creation knows 
 Somethin's on the move 
 Sweeping the land 
 Blanketing sin 
 There's a world full of colors 
 We can barely remember 
 (On the move again) 
 This is no thaw 
 This is morning to all 
 This is life, wild life 
 Comin' back from December 
 (On the move again) 
 Sweepin' across the land 
 Bringing all the colors 
 Bringin' back color 
 Mournin' to joy 
 Mournin' to joy 
 (On the move again) 
 Stirring below 
 Starting to grow 
 There's a world full of colors 
 We can barely remember 
 (On the move again) 
 Stirring below 
 Pushing through snow 
 There is life, wild life 
 Comin' back from December 
 (On the move again) 
 Sweeping the land 
 Blanketing sin 
 Is a world full of colors 
 We can barely remember 
 (On the move again) 
 This is no thaw 
 This is mornin' to all 
 This is life, wild life 
 Comin' back from December 
 (On the move again)

Do you know who you're gonna be today 
 Do you know know what part your gonna play 
 When you stare into the mirror yeah 
 Empty eyes speak more words than I can say 
 Is somethin' missing in your life today 
 Somethin's missing, missing, missing somethin's 
 Is somethin' missing in your life today 
 Somethin's missing, missing, missing somethin's 
 You may say that all the world's a stage 
 Is the script for your role an empty page 
 Do your actions have a meaning yeah 
 Will they last, or will they quickly fade away

It's not a family trait, 
 It's nothing that I ate, 
 And it didn't come from skating with Holy Rollers, 
 It's an early warning sign, 
 It keeps my life in line, 
 But it's so hard to define, 
 Nevermind... 
 It's just a spirit thing, 
 It's just a holy nudge, 
 It's like a circuit judge in the brain. 
 It's just a spirit thing, 
 It's here to guard my heart, 
 It's just a little hard to explain. 
 It pushes when I quit, 
 It smells a counterfit, 
 Sometimes it works a bit like a teleprompter... 
 When it's telepromting you, 
 I pray you'll let it through, 
 And I'll help you with the how, 
 But for now... 
 I took the long way, 
 Bent back down again, 
 Some things will never 
 Ever be explained. 
 No they can not be explained... 
 Yeah

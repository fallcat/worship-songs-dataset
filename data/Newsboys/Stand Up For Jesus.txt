Living for Jesus is the way I will go 
 I'll follow Him always, don't care what men say 
 I've been on both sides and I know where I'll stay 
 The light He has shown me will not fade away 
 Stand up, stand up, stand up for Jesus 
 Oh can't you hear me, He's the way 
 Stand up, stand up, stand up for Jesus 
 Oh can't you hear me, He's the way 
 Where are you standing if you were to fall 
 Religion won't help you if He calls on you now 
 Stand up and be counted say I'm for the Lord 
 Don't keep so quiet, go forth and be bold

I say hello 
 To anyone who's listening 
 Put on a show 
 If that's what makes your ears prick 
 This microphone 
 Will take a word and make it bigger 
 Oh hello 
 So here goes 
 Steppin' right up to the microphone 
 I say hey man! 
 There's only one way! 
 One God one body one faith alone 
 If you don't know 
 Then ya need to be told! 
 I say hey boy 
 It's a narrow road 
 I say hello to anyone who's listening 
 The message ain't nothing new 
 I don't decide what's true 
 So when the stones gets thrown 
 They either miss or they turn to glory 
 Here's the story as far as I know 
 Steppin' up 
 I don't step alone 
 The question is how do we know what we know? 
 The answer is so plain to see 
 So here I go 
 Tap the mic "test 1,2,3"

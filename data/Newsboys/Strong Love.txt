He swings to the left, 
 She leans to the right, 
 But that doesn't make a fight a given. 
 And some pitch their tents in the middle 
 Of the fence, but it doesn't matter 
 Where you're living. 
 'Cause His spirit's in me, His spirit's in you, 
 So there's a common bond between us. 
 And the mission for me is a mission for 
 You - we have a common cause to link us. 
 Strong love yeah, people. 
 Strong strong love between us. 
 Strong love yeah, people, and you know 
 It's true that it always must be there. 
 He worships while he grooves, 
 She prays and barely moves, 
 But they're both reflecting pure devotion. 
 And some go for broke like headless chicken-folk 
 (Inspiring jokes about poultry-in-motion). 
 'Cause His spirit's in me, His spirit's in you, 
 So there's a common bond between us. 
 And the mission for me is a mission for you - 
 We have a common cause to link us. 
 Strong love yeah, people. 
 Strong strong love between us. 
 Strong love yeah, people, and you know 
 It's true that it always must be there. 
 Now don't just agree and then wait on history. 
 This is not a duty-free abstraction. 
 Divisions get blurred and the message 
 Gets heard by puttin' Jesus' words in action. 
 It's a master design it's a million watt sign. 
 You can see it shine like patent leather. 
 It's a way people see how heaven's 
 Gonna be when we live in unity together. 
 Strong love yeah, people. 
 Strong strong love between us. 
 Strong love yeah, people, and you know 
 It's true that it always must be there. 
 Strong love yeah, people. 
 Strong strong love between us. 
 Strong love love yeah, people, 
 And you know it feels like 
 It always will be there.

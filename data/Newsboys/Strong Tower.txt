Strong and mighty 
 Strong to save us 
 Like a fortress 
 Never failing 
 Strong in battle 
 Strong in kindness 
 When we stray, Lord 
 You're strong to find us 
 When the winds come hard against us 
 You are steadfast, You are true 
 When the ground beneath us trembles 
 Your foundation never moves 
 Strong tower 
 High and glorious 
 Strong tower 
 Mighty in love 
 Our refuge 
 Our defender 
 Strong tower 
 Lord above 
 Strong to lead us 
 Through the shadows 
 Strong to carry 
 All our sorrows 
 When the enemy surrounds us 
 Closing in as darkness falls 
 Though his armies rage against us 
 They can never scale these walls 
 You are my shelter, my shield 
 You are the home I could never deserve 
 Here I will serve, ever under Your gaze 
 Here I will serve, ever singing Your praise 
 Strong tower 
 Lord above 
 Strong tower 
 Lord above

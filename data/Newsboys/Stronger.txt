Here is love that came for us 
 Humbled to a sinner's cross 
 You broke my shame and sinfulness 
 You rose again victorious 
 Faithfulness none can deny 
 Through the storm and through the fire 
 There is truth that sets me free 
 Jesus Christ who lives in me 
 You are stronger, You are stronger 
 Sin is broken, You have saved me 
 It is written, Christ is risen 
 Jesus, You are Lord of all 
 No beginning and no end 
 You're my hope and my defense 
 You came to seek and save the lost 
 You paid it all upon the cross 
 So let Your name be lifted higher 
 Be lifted higher, be lifted higher 
 So let Your name be lifted higher 
 Be lifted higher, be lifted higher 
 So let Your name be lifted higher 
 Be lifted higher, be lifted higher

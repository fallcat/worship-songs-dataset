Isabelle is a belly dancer with a kleptomaniac's restraint 
 Tried stealing Helena's hand basket, 
 Made a fast getaway, but McQueen she ain't 
 At the courtroom Joshua judges her ruthlessly 
 On account of Ruth walking out on him 
 In the Big House Isabelle is a-telling all to 
 The chaplain who's become her friend 
 She says: I don't know why you care 
 I don't know what's out there 
 I don't know where or how 
 Just take me to your Leader now 
 Take me to your Leader now 
 Justin is adjustin' to the odor from 
 Theodore's Evergreen Incense 
 But aroma therapy don't make him any 
 Younger than Oliver's Oil Liver Supplements 
 His late mate Merrilee merrily said 
 Immortality can't be bought in a jar 
 This just in: Justin's had enough of cure-alls, 
 Gonna quiz the neighbor kid with the fish on his car 
 He says: I don't know why you care 
 I don't know what's out there 
 I don't know how it's done 
 Just take me to your Leader, son 
 I see you've got the joy 
 I've seen you live it, boy 
 It's real, it's free, it's fun, 
 So take me to your leader, son 
 Take me to your Leader, son. 
 They don't know why we care 
 They don't know what's out there 
 They don't know how it's done 
 Let's Take 'Em To Our Leader's Son 
 They see we've got the joy 
 They see us live it, oi 
 It's real, it's free, it's fun, 
 Let's Take 'Em To Our Leader's Son 
 (Repeat)

Take my hands, take my feet 
 Take the music to the street 
 Hear the prayers, feel the sound 
 A generation Kingdom bound 
 Great and glorious 
 Is my Savior 
 Praises on my tongue 
 From my heart 
 For our God who became flesh 
 For us all 
 Unto You 
 I will sing Your praises 
 Sing forever 
 Take my will, take my all 
 Wrap my life around Your call 
 Set apart to sing Your praise 
 To live the difference in these days 
 Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing 
 To sing aloud, sing aloud 
 Oh, for the glory of my God and King 
 Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing

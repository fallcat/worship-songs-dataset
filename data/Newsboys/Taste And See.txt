Taste and see that the Lord is good 
 Taste and see He's so good for you 
 Taste and see that the Lord is good 
 Taste and see He's so good for you 
 For the light will bring to all a harvest 
 Good and plenty but for those who don't 
 Don't believe it, their life will still 
 Will still be empty 
 Taste and see that the Lord is good 
 Taste and see He's so good for you 
 Taste and see that the Lord is good 
 Taste and see He's so good for you 
 Don't let yourself, yourself be taken 
 By the foolish words of men 
 They say that God is oh so tasteless 
 But they've never tasted Him 
 Ah, I gotta express my point of view 
 To the world, so I'm tellin' you 
 Newsboys are here in effect with the Word of God 
 And so you'd better check us out 
 We're Christians, you know what I mean 
 Fullbustin' a rap with the Holy Ghost scene 
 Throwing down the truth, as a matter of fact 
 Step up, homie, it's a sanctified rap 
 Christians? You betcha 
 And if you wanna know, I'm gonna let ya 
 That the power of God has taken over my life 
 And give your life to Him and it will get ya 
 Taste and see that the Lord is good 
 Taste and see He's so good for you 
 Taste and see that the Lord is good

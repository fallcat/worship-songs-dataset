For we have known how to be in need 
 And we have known what it is to have plenty 
 There are costs that we all must pay 
 For some it's harder harder for them to stay 
 I will live for you 
 I'll walk with you I'd even die for you 
 I will follow you ten thousand miles 
 Ten thousand more 
 For I have seen a vision of heaven 
 And we are here for just a short lived time 
 No time to chase the gold, the glory 
 There is a fire, fire in our hearts 
 We have learned a valuable secret 
 To be content in every situation 
 We can do everything through Him 
 He gives us strength to, strength to

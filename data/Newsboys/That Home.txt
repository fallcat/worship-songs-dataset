There was a home in town 
 Where broken kids, the lost & found 
 Would come from miles around 
 Just to see, what love was all about 
 'Cause Momma had a way of makin' things okay 
 She'd cook us our favorite meal 
 Sit and listen to how we feel 
 Oh, how the pain was real 
 How many families what the devil steal? 
 Momma had a way of makin' things okay 
 In that home 
 We knew we were safe 
 To be young enough to dream 
 Find the faith to believe 
 And in that home 
 Love, it had no end 
 It's where we learned to forgive 
 In that home 
 Momma always had the music on 
 Sometimes loud, sometimes soft 
 When I asked her 'bout her favorite song 
 She opened the bible to the book of Psalms 
 She always found a way to talk about grace 
 In that home 
 We knew we were safe 
 To be young enough to dream 
 Find the faith to believe 
 And in that home 
 Love, it had no end 
 That's where we learned to forgive 
 In that home 
 And on that day I got the news 
 That Momma's stay here was almost through 
 I stayed all night by her side 
 Held her hand, looked in her eyes 
 And said, Momma 
 When you're home 
 I know you'll be safe 
 Strong enough to see 
 The faith that you believed 
 And in that home 
 Life will have no end 
 I know I'll see you again 
 In that home

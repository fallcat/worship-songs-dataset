That's how you change the world 
 That's how you change the world 
 All my life I had big dreams 
 To do big things and make a change 
 And all the while, I just passed by 
 The simple needs right here next to me 
 'Cause there's a breaking heart 
 That's fallin' apart 
 And tear filled eyes lookin' back at me 
 God, won't you help me to see 
 It's the prayer in an empty room 
 Little things we do when nobody's around 
 A hand reaching out to a heart in doubt 
 It's the smallest spark that can light the dark 
 That's how you change the world 
 Oh oh oh oh (Change the world) 
 That's how you change the world 
 Oh oh oh oh (Change the world) 
 A million little drops of rain 
 Can be enough to cause a tidal wave 
 A flood of Your love 
 That no one can contain 
 'Cause there's an empty soul 
 That wants to be known 
 Around me now, that I can lead to You 
 Revealing love that won't refuse 
 It's the kind words 
 A simple smile 
 More than showin' up 
 Going the extra mile 
 It's giving everything 
 When you've got nothin' left 
 Sharin' a little hope 
 With a single breath 
 That's how you change the world 
 That's how you change the world 
 It's the prayer in an empty room 
 A hand reaching out to a heart in doubt

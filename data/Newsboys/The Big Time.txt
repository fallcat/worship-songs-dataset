There's a time for war 
 There's a time for peace 
 A time to live and a time to die 
 A time to grieve and a time to dance 
 This time is for you 
 Ain't no use in looking back, no 
 Keep on plowing straight ahead, yo 
 Nothin' left back in Egypt land 
 When the big time comes around 
 There's a time to cry 
 And a time to laugh 
 A time for throwing away 
 There's a time for death and a time for life 
 Now's the time for you 
 There's a time to run 
 And a time to stand 
 A time for looking ahead 
 There's a time to stay 
 And a time to go 
 This time it's for you 
 There's a time for everything 
 And now's the time to serve the King 
 There's a time for all to see 
 And now's the time for you and me

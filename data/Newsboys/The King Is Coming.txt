Make a way for 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for the King 
 The King is coming 
 Empty hearts are filling up 
 Wicked ways are coming undone 
 Every eye is looking out for You 
 City lights are burning out 
 Freedom's song is ringing loud 
 Dead men waking up to the sound of You 
 And all our hearts can sing 
 All our hearts can sing is... 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for the King 
 The King is coming 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for the King 
 The King is coming 
 The King is coming 
 Split the sky with Your glory 
 Bring to life an awakening 
 Burn away everything that's not for You 
 Hear our voices crying out 
 We won't stop till the heavens come down 
 We won't stop till every knee bows to You 
 And all our hearts can sing is... 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for the King 
 The King is coming 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for the King 
 The King is coming 
 Open up the doors 
 Open up the doors 
 Open up the doors 
 Our King is coming 
 Open up the doors 
 Open up the doors 
 Lift your eyes to see 
 Our King is coming 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for the King 
 Our King is coming 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for 
 Make a way for the King 
 Our King is coming 
 Our King is coming 
 Our King is coming

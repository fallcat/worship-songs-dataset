I wrote you a letter 
 Things could be better 
 Full of promises, you got hopes and dreams 
 Did you get it 
 Have you read it 
 It talks about you and Me 
 And the future, you see 
 Something no one can do 
 Is take the place of you 
 Oh can't you see you're one of a kind 
 Child, you're like a star 
 Set apart 
 Set apart from the start of the world 
 This is your time 
 Rise and shine 
 Child you're one of a kind 
 Sometimes every thing's too much 
 Like the deepest cut 
 That hurts to be touched 
 When you hear it 
 When you feel it 
 Don't let it have its way 
 I'm trying to say 
 Something no one can do 
 Is take the place of you 
 Oh can't you see you're one of a kind 
 Oh, child, you're like a star 
 Set apart 
 Set apart from the start of the world 
 This is your time 
 Rise and shine 
 Child you're one of a kind 
 I know it's hard to hear promises 
 When the blue has turned to grey 
 Nobody said it was easy 
 But I know you'll find your way 
 Oh, child, you're like a star 
 Set apart 
 Set apart from the start of the world 
 This is your time 
 Rise and shine, yeah 
 You're one of a kind 
 Child, you're like a star 
 Set apart 
 Set apart from the start of the world 
 This is your time 
 Rise and shine, yeah 
 Child you're one of a kind 
 One of a kind 
 One of a kind 
 You're One of a kind 
 You are 
 You are

Every generation 
 Blames the one before 
 And all of their frustrations 
 Come beating on your door 
 I know that I'm a prisoner 
 To all my Father held so dear 
 I know that I'm a hostage 
 To all his hopes and fears 
 I just wish I could have told him in the living years 
 Crumpled bits of paper 
 Filled with imperfect thoughts 
 Stilted conversations 
 I'm afraid that's all we've got 
 You say you just don't see it 
 He says it's perfect sense 
 You just can't get agreement 
 In this present tense 
 We all talk a different language 
 Talkin' in defense 
 Say it loud, say it clear 
 You can listen as well as you hear 
 It's too late when we die 
 To admit we don't see eye to eye 
 So we open up a quarrel 
 Between the present and the past 
 We only sacrifice the future 
 It's the bitterness that lasts 
 So Don't yield to the fortunes 
 You sometimes see as fate 
 It may have a new perspective 
 On a different date 
 And if you don't give up, and don't give in 
 You may just be O.K. 
 Say it loud, say it clear 
 You can listen as well as you hear 
 It's too late when we die 
 To admit we don't see eye to eye 
 I wasn't there that morning 
 When my Father passed away 
 I didn't get to tell him 
 All the things I had to say 
 I think I caught his spirit 
 Later that same year 
 I'm sure I heard his echo 
 In my baby's new born tears 
 I just wish I could have told him in the living years 
 Say it loud, say it clear 
 You can listen as well as you hear 
 It's too late when we die 
 To admit we don't see eye to eye 
 Say it loud, say it clear 
 Say it loud 
 Don't give up 
 Don't give in 
 And don't know what you can do next

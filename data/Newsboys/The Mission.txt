Go album version: 
 When the runners came from Bethlehem 
 All breathless with good news 
 They were passing a baton forward through time 
 The commission, from God's lips to our ears 
 Carried by His saints two thousand years 
 Connects us all to the same lifeline 
 As I fix my eyes ahead 
 I can feel the Spirit's breath... 
 (And) I can hear the mission bell ringing out loud and clear 
 It's the revolution Jesus started, and it's here 
 Echoing across the world from the shores of Galilee 
 I can hear the mission bell call for you and me 
 I wanna run with fire 
 It's my heart's desire 
 Lifting Your love higher 
 In the history of our faith's arrivals 
 Great awakenings, Welsh revivals 
 Saints and martyrs, summoned by a new birth 
 Patrick's save of the Irish nation 
 William Carey's expectation 
 Lambs & lions 
 Called to the ends of the earth 
 Gotta put my hand to the plow 
 Not looking back, not nowâ€¦oh, oh 
 I can hear the mission bell ringing out loud and clear 
 It's the revolution Jesus started, and it's here 
 Echoing across the world from the shores of Galilee 
 I can hear the mission bell call for you and me 
 I wanna run with fire 
 It's my heart's desire 
 Lifting Your love higher 
 It's my heart's desire 
 I can hear the mission bell ringing out loud and clear 
 It's the revolution Jesus started, and it's here 
 Echoing across the world from the shores of Galilee 
 I can hear the mission bell call for you and me 
 I can hear the mission bell ringing out loud and clear 
 It's the revolution Jesus started, and it's here 
 I wanna run with fire 
 It's my heart's desire 
 Lifting Your love higher 
 It's my heart's desire

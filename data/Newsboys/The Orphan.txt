Maybe I push when I'm meant to be still 
 Maybe I take it all to personal 
 Jesus, how to reconcile 
 The joyful noise 
 The ancient land 
 The tug from some invisible hand 
 The dying mother weaving bulrushes 
 Along the Nile 
 Float her basket over the sea 
 Here on a barren shore 
 We'll be waiting for 
 A tailwind to carry her (an) orphan's cry 
 Don't you worry, child 
 I wrote a lullaby 
 I try to settle, but I just pass through 
 A rain dog, gypsy 
 A wandering Jew 
 All those homes were not ours 
 Then I slept one night 
 In Abraham's field 
 And dreamt there was no moon 
 The night he died 
 Counting stars 
 Selah 
 Building you a home 
 Building you a home 
 Building you a home 
 We're building you a home 
 Selah 
 Float her basket over the sea 
 Here on a barren shore 
 We'll be waiting for 
 A tailwind to bring us your sweet cry 
 Don't you worry, child 
 I'm gonna sing you a lullaby

Think I'll wait for the tide 
 Seems it's all I can do right now 
 There must be a reason I've run aground 
 I'll wait for the waves to come 
 By the moon and the tide 
 Like a man and his bride 
 I will wait on you, Lord 
 And we will run so far from here 
 To your ... safety 
 Think I'll lie in the sun for a while 
 Maybe inside out 
 I've been leaving messages for you 
 And I'm sure it will all work out 
 And I know the waves will come 
 By the moon and the tide 
 Like a man and his bride 
 I will wait on you, Lord 
 And we will run so far from here 
 To your safety in the storm 
 There is courage for the simple man 
 To the holders of secrets and scars 
 Learning to stand with reaching arms 
 We'll wait until the very last 
 No matter what will be 
 You're always good 
 Always good to me 
 And we will run so far from here 
 I know the waves will come 
 By the moon and the tide 
 Like a man and his bride 
 I will wait on you, Lord 
 And we will run so far from here 
 I know the waves will come 
 By the moon and the tide 
 Like a man and his bride 
 I will wait on you, Lord 
 And we will run so far from here 
 To your ... safety 
 To your ... safety 
 To your ... safety 
 To your ... to your safety

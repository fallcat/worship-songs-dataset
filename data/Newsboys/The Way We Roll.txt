Rewind the clock, we were 
 Ridin' a wave of Oz rock, we were 
 B-barely of age to take charge, or pack our guitars for the long flight 
 Should be all right 
 No cash or plan, we were 
 Criss-crossing the states in some van 
 We were c-c-cooking our beans on the block while the motor was hot 
 Something's gonna blow, let's get to the show 
 Give us half an inch, 
 We'll be tackin' on a mile 
 Give us a half stage, 
 We'll start up a rampage 
 Put on your back pack 
 Throw out your road map, 
 God'll use anything 
 Check it and see 
 He's given us more than we ever could ask for 
 That's the way we roll, 'cause we've been set free 
 That's the way we roll, 'cause we've been set free 
 Reset the stage, we were, out rattling the cage 
 With each show, we were 
 Out hawkin' our shirts 
 For more lights 
 To shine, hit the brights 
 And we saw your faces 
 And we got new bassists 
 Good and the lame, we were 
 Spinning our drums like a dial 
 We were, blowing up domes from a pile 
 It worked for awhile 
 If yours didn't rise 
 We apologize 
 All we got to give is a God-given drive 
 He keeps us movin' 
 He keeps on provin' 
 Put on your back pack 
 Throw out your road map, 
 God'll use anything 
 Check it and see 
 He's given us more than we ever could ask for 
 That's the way we roll, 'cause we've been set free 
 That's the way we roll, 'cause we've been set free 
 Lighten up 
 We'll lighten up the load at the 
 Startin' gate, we'll 
 Lighten up the load to a fightin' weight 
 We'll light up the road 
 C'mon, kiss your mamma goodbye 
 We got to fly 
 Put on your back pack 
 Throw out your road map 
 God'll use anything 
 Check it and see 
 He's givin' us more than we ever could ask for 
 That's the way you roll when you've been set free 
 Put on your back pack 
 Throw out your road map 
 God'll use anything 
 Check it and see 
 He's givin' us more than we ever could ask for 
 That's the way we roll 'cause we've been set free 
 That's the way we roll 'cause we've been set free 
 That's the way we roll 'cause we've been set free

This is not the warm-up round 
 This is not a trial heat 
 It can't be repeated when your time has gone 
 This is not an infinite resource 
 Or the prelude to a starter course 
 You don't send it back if it gets done wrong 
 This is your life 
 Treat yourself right 
 Treat others right 
 Live like you know you should 
 This is life 
 Fight the good fight 
 Fight for what's right 
 Do what you know you should 
 Every living soul completes 
 A finite number of heartbeats 
 This is not the sum of what you're here for 
 Every breath you take will be exhaled 
 Every rising sun will fall 
 The measure of it all is what you live for 
 You had a dream 
 But it got lost in a life of regret 
 The devil knows you get just one shot 
 You had a dream 
 Are you still dreaming or did you forget 
 That heaven's calling for your best shot

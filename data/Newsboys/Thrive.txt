Down here in the valley 
 Every shadow you see 
 Has its own story 
 Down here in the valley 
 Every puddle of mud 
 Comes from tears and blood 
 And it's so hard just to get warm 
 That the chill turns into despair 
 Will you lift me up with tender care? 
 Will you wash me clean in the palm of Your hands? 
 Will hold me close so I can thrive? 
 When you touch me, that's when I know I'm alive 
 Down here in the valley 
 Nothing's able to grow 
 'Cause the light's too low 
 Folks spend their days 
 Digging 'round for diamonds and gold 
 Till they just get old 
 And they don't know anything else 
 They don't know they're breathing bad air 
 But I'm tired of living like this 
 And my soul cries out, "If you're there..." 
 Will you lift me up with tender care? 
 Will you wash me clean in the palm of Your hands? 
 Lord, hold me close so I can thrive 
 When you touch me, that's when I know I'm alive 
 Call me up to your side 
 Draw me up to your light 
 Let it blind me 
 Lord, refine me 
 Refine me out of my mind 
 Will you lift me up with tender care? 
 Will you wash me clean in the palm of Your hands? 
 Lord, hold me close so I can thrive 
 When you touch me, that's when I know 
 I know I'm alive 
 Will you lift me up with tender care? 
 Will you wash me clean in the palm of Your hands? 
 Lord, hold me close so I can thrive 
 When you touch me, that's when I know I'm alive 
 Lord, lift me up with tender care 
 Will you wash me clean in the palm of Your hands? 
 Lord, hold me close so I can thrive 
 When you touch me, that's when I know 
 I know I'm alive

Poster child for the Christian single 
 Dumped on more than a birdhouse shingle 
 Tired of the same old crowd, she starts to 
 Mingle where she don't belong 
 All God's bachelors hanging in a bunch 
 Wolves in Wool-light beat 'em to the punch 
 Score another knockout, barely bought her lunch 
 What went wrong? 
 Let's talk about real life 
 Truth and consequences 
 And coming to our senses 
 And lies we'd best unlearn 
 Let's talk about real love 
 Truth and propaganda 
 Are you really gonna stand for 
 Love that waits its turn? 
 I am the voice of the male agenda 
 Sensitive, strong or shy, I tend to 
 Act anyway that would possibly send you 
 Somewhere we can be alone 
 You're so sure I'm a would be Christian 
 Suckered by the "Untamed Heart" condition 
 Love that feminine intuition 
 Seen that movie, too 
 Let's talk about real life...

 Never actually studied for the 
 Priesthood. I've had lots of 
 Destructive relationsps, and 
 I know I don't deserve 
 Someone like you anyway. It's 
 Just, there's this strange 
 Purity about you... almost a 
 Radiance. Maybe it comes from 
 Your religious beliefs, I don't 
 Know. I guess what I'm trying 
 To say is, you're unlike any 
 Woman I've ever met... is it 
 Getting hot in here? Can I help 
 You with that jacket? 
 No, no, I know you've got to 
 Go... Oh! No, it's nothing. I've 
 Just got this really bad kink in 
 My neck... you don't suppose 
 You could just massage it a 
 Little, could you

He nods a little too fast 
 Talking illogic with a big bombast 
 He's full on dead sure any way's true 
 And he wouldn't wanna knock it if it works for you, hey 
 He heave sighs a little too loud, 
 So frustrated with the one-way in crowd 
 Full on dead sure anything goes 
 Until you go stepping on his own toes 
 Hold on if the truth be known 
 Truth is more than "to each his own" 
 If the truth be known 
 There'll be more to answer for 
 Everybody gets a shot 
 It'll cost everything you've got 
 If the truth be known 
 Do you really wanna know? 
 She tries a little denial 
 Rolls her eyes like a jaded reptile 
 True/false questions make her uptight 
 Opposites attract, so they both must be right 
 What if there's someone up there? 
 Shrugs it off with a "don't know, don't care" 
 Hopes to God he doesn't exist 
 But ignorance here is less than bliss 
 Hold on if the truth be known 
 Truth is more than "to each his own" 
 If the truth be known 
 There'll be more to answer for 
 Everybody gets a shot 
 It'll cost everything you've got 
 If the truth be known 
 Do you really wanna know? 
 Hold on if the truth be known 
 Truth is more than "to each his own" 
 If the truth be known 
 There'll be more to answer for 
 Everybody gets a shot 
 It'll cost everything you've got 
 If the truth be known 
 Do you really wanna know? 
 Hold on if the truth be known

You may be in london, 
 Waiting on a train 
 You may be in paris 
 Dancing on a stage 
 Or shooting the curl in bali or 
 Down south drinking sweet tea 
 You may be glued to the television 
 As happy 
 As larry 
 You may be a doctor, 
 Giving up the ghost 
 You may be a short order cook 
 Fixing grits and toast 
 Whenever 
 Wherever 
 Whoever you are 
 Let it be 
 Plain to see 
 It's time to reach for 
 Something higher 
 Everybody hears the need 
 Tuning in around the world 
 All you boys and all you girls 
 Tune in till ya drown the noise 
 All you girls and all you boys 
 Tune it in and hum along 
 Let it lift the woebegone 
 Tune it in around the world 
 All you boys and all you girls 
 It may be your birthday 
 Or it may be your last 
 As a kid you couldn't wait to get old 
 Now the years fly by to fast 
 Whenever 
 Wherever 
 Whoever you are 
 Let it be plain 
 To see 
 No time 
 No place 
 Nobody but you 
 Will keep you from your 
 Knees 
 (I say) 
 Let the truth fill up our lives 
 Let the choir fire up and over 
 The renewal of our minds is 
 Never over till it's over 
 And where our treasure is 
 That's where our hearts will be 
 So take my will 
 And set me 
 Tuning into you 
 Tuning outta me.

You say My love goes away 
 I say it's there forever 
 I know you'll see the day 
 That love will leave you never 
 I wait around the river bend 
 Lead Me through the rapids ahead 
 And when the waters rise 
 I'll be there 
 I can be the One you turn to 
 I'm not a god of wood or stone 
 Trust in Me and I will show you 
 My love will never leave you alone 
 Don't let your faith be shattered 
 Stand firm on that shaky ground 
 Reach out, give your praise to Me 
 Let Me take your heavy burden 
 I see the time ahead 
 I stop the danger in the night 
 I know your breaking strain 
 I'll be there 
 I can be the One you turn to 
 I'm not a god of wood or stone 
 Trust in Me and I will show you 
 My love will never leave you alone

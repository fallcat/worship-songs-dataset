Look at the front page; turn on the TV 
 They fire another round at you and me 
 Their guns are loaded; they're takin' aim 
 Nobody told them we're not all the same 
 No paranoia; nobody could 
 Just write it off as being Hollywood 
 The innuendo between the lines 
 Leaves no confusion 'bout what's on their minds (whoa) 
 I won't go underground 
 I won't turn and flee 
 I won't bow the knee 
 I won't go underground 
 I won't run and hide 
 From the rising tide 
 I won't go underground 
 I won't compromise 
 What the world denies 
 I won't go underground 
 And I'm not ashamed 
 Of the cross I've claimed (No) 
 Listen: They've taken notes on what we say 
 You know they'd like to lock us all away 
 Can't stop the movement; can't make it slow 
 Persecution always makes us grow 
 They've got my number; it's no surprise 
 I'm here and wearing no disguise 
 Bring out the lions and heat up the fire 
 It's not enough to stop this man's desire (No) 
 I won't go underground 
 I won't turn and flee 
 I won't bow the knee 
 I won't go underground 
 I'll keep holding fast 
 To the very last 
 I won't go underground 
 I will turn my cheek 
 I will boldly speak 
 I won't go underground 
 I am not ashamed of the cross I've claimed 
 I know the Spirit behind this force 
 It's not surprising if you know the Source 
 I'll pray for freedom for helpless ones 
 And I'll keep standing till the new day dawns (whoa) 
 I won't go underground 
 I won't turn and flee 
 I won't bow the knee 
 I won't go underground 
 I won't run and hide 
 From the rising tide 
 I won't go underground 
 I won't compromise 
 What the world denies 
 I won't go underground 
 I am not ashamed 
 Of the cross I've claimed 
 I won't go underground 
 And I won't lay low 
 As the hatreds grow 
 I won't go underground 
 (Whoa) 
 I won't go underground 
 (I won't, I won't) 
 I won't go underground

Chasing after the rainbow's end 
 Left me clutching a fistful of wind. 
 That last adventure must have been just a waste of my time. 
 Ten pleasures for every wish. 
 Twenty scratches for every itch. 
 One hundred ways to catch a fish. 
 Just a waste of my time. 
 Dead beats, dead end streets, every step I falter. 
 Fill my cup, fill me up, take me to the altar. 
 Upon this rock I've a reason. 
 Upon this rock I am strong. 
 Upon this rock I've a reason. 
 I'm standing where I belong. 
 Wish I hadn't built as big a house. 
 Makes it hard to catch a little mouse. 
 (I'd chase it but I'm feeling drowsy, 
 All from wasting my time.) 
 I need a glimpse of my calling now, 
 Get my feet back behind the plow. 
 This idle age will not allow 
 Just a waste of my time. 
 This day burn away every indecision. 
 Angst-free anchor me. 
 Make my life a mission.

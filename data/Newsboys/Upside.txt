It's been a long, long fall 
 With nothing to intervene 
 When gravity does its thing 
 We start wondering what it's for 
 Stuck in a cold dark basement 
 You surely expected more 
 But all you can see these days 
 Is four walls and a floor 
 Come up here 
 We're making our way 
 To the upside 
 We're gonna stay on 
 The upside 
 We trade our troubles 
 For a room with a view 
 Come up here 
 We're making our way 
 To the upside 
 A brand new day on 
 The upside 
 The future's brighter than a 
 Sky full of blue 
 It's been a long, long fall 
 The Adam who would be king 
 When consequence does its thing 
 We all want it like before 
 No where to go, laid low 
 Like a dumpster diver, like a 
 Submarine wreck scraping the bottom deck 
 Won't you, don't you 
 Pray there's something more 
 What's gonna hold us down? 
 Who's gonna hold us down? 
 How's it gonna hold us down? 
 Nothing's gonna hold us 
 Come up 
 We'll make our way 
 To the upside 
 We're here to stay on 
 The upside 
 The future's shining like a 
 Sky full of blue 
 Come up here 
 We're making our way 
 To the upside 
 We're gonna stay on 
 The upside 
 The future's brighter than a 
 Sky full of blue

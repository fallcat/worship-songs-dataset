Now turn your back on things of the world 
 Let's have our victory through Jesus 
 Trust in the Lord with all your heart 
 In all your ways acknowledge Him 
 And He shall make your paths straight 
 If any man be in Christ he is new 
 We, we have the victory through Jesus 
 We, we have the victory through Jesus 
 Let's stand and proclaim His name 
 Throughout the earth 
 Throughout the earth 
 There is a way that seems right unto a man 
 But it will end in death I say 
 The way I walk is chosen by the Lord 
 And He shall give His angels charge 
 To watch over you 
 If any man he take in Christ he is new

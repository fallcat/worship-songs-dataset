I've been thinking it's about time 
 To win the war that fights against all the lies invading my mind 
 You have brought me to my senses 
 Even though You built this world to shake 
 You still love me in a personal way 
 So I think it's time to leave my doubt behind 
 There's so much more than meets the eye 
 Or what's going on inside 
 I believe in something way beyond myself 
 Like the wind that moves the leaves 
 Lord, You move me to my knees 
 I believe in something way beyond myself 
 Oh the way we build our empires hoping to impress our friends 
 We've forgotten how to inspire those who fall to rise again 
 Oh my God, You've built this world to shake 
 You still love me in a personal way 
 So I think it's time to leave my doubt behind 
 Storms are gonna come my way, I know 
 Some things are out of our control but there's a hope beyond myself 
 It's You and You will never let me go 
 Now I want my life to show You got me thinking beyond myself 
 Way beyond myself 
 There's so much more than meets the eye 
 Or what's going on inside 
 I believe in something way beyond myself 
 Like the wind that moves the leaves 
 Lord, You move me to my knees 
 I believe in something way beyond myself

In this time of desperation 
 When all we know is doubt and fear 
 There is only One Foundation 
 We believe, We believe 
 In this broken generation 
 When all is dark, You help us see 
 There is only One Salvation 
 We believe, We believe 
 We believe in God the Father 
 We believe in Jesus Christ 
 We believe in the Holy Spirit 
 And He's given us new life 
 We believe in the crucifixion 
 We believe that He conquered death 
 We believe in the resurrection 
 And He's comin' back again, we believe 
 So, let our faith be more than anthems 
 Greater than the songs we sing 
 And in our weakness and temptations 
 We believe, We believe! 
 We believe in God the Father! 
 We believe in Jesus Christ! 
 We believe in the Holy Spirit! 
 And He's given us new life! 
 We believe in the crucifixion! 
 We believe that He conquered death! 
 We believe in the resurrection! 
 And He's comin' back again! 
 Let the lost be found and the dead be raised! 
 In the here and now, let love invade! 
 Let the church live love our God will see 
 We believe, We believe! 
 And the gates of hell will not prevail! 
 For the power of God, has torn the vail! 
 Now we know Your love will never fail! 
 We believe, We believe! 
 We believe in God the Father 
 We believe in Jesus Christ 
 We believe in the Holy Spirit 
 And He's given us new life! 
 We believe in the crucifixion! 
 We believe that He conquered death! 
 We believe in the resurrection! 
 And He's comin' back, 
 He's comin' back again! 
 He's comin' back again! 
 We believe!

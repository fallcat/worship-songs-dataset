Waiting. 
 We're waiting for apologies, 
 And we're waiting. 
 We're both expecting sympathies. 
 Another hour is gone. 
 We sulk and carry on 
 So stubborn-hearted. 
 Waiting. 
 We're marking secret borders now, 
 And we're waiting. 
 We're in our separate corners now. 
 We wait for night to fall. 
 We can't even recall 
 What got this started. 
 Now is the time and here is the place, 
 'Cause we lose these hours casting blame 
 When we should be saying grace. 
 We can find a better way. 
 We can stand on common ground. 
 We can work this out 
 Between us before the sun goes down. 
 We come together. 
 Waiting. 
 We don't know what 
 We're trying to prove, 
 But we're waiting. 
 Until the other makes a move 
 We stick to our facades. 
 We only speak in nods and sullen glances. 
 And we're waiting. Our shadows just get longer now. 
 But oh my love, we both are feeling wronger now 
 We need to start again before this day 
 Has stolen all our chances. 
 Now is the time and here is the place, 
 'Cause we lose these hours casting blame 
 When we should be saying grace. 
 We can find a better way. 
 We can stand on common ground. 
 We can work this out 
 Between us before the sun goes down. 
 We come together.

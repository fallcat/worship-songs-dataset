How could we forget 
 When You touched the earth on that starry night 
 Angels sang glory to God on high 
 We remember 
 How could we forget 
 The moment the water became wine 
 Stories of men leaving all behind 
 We remember 
 The story burns upon our hearts 
 A beautiful and binding scar 
 Forever we will 
 Forever we will think of You 
 We remember 
 We remember You, Oh Lord 
 We remember 
 We remember You, Oh Lord 
 How could we forget 
 There in the garden You cried for it 
 The city that cursed You and turned You in 
 We remember 
 How could we forget 
 Death has no power and we are free 
 The good thought of us there on calvary 
 We remember 
 The story burns upon our hearts 
 A beautiful and binding scar 
 Forever we will, forever we will think of You 
 Oh think of You 
 We remember 
 We remember You, Oh Lord 
 We remember 
 We remember You, Oh Lord 
 Oh, the the things that You have done 
 And great things You've yet to do 
 Oh, Jesus, we remember You 
 How could we forget 
 The moment Your love rolled the stone away 
 Our hearts were opened our lives were changed 
 We remember 
 How we could forget 
 The promise of hope and that trumpet sound 
 We'll see Your glory roll back the clouds 
 We remember 
 We remember You, O Lord 
 We remember You our King 
 We remember You the son of God 
 Who came to set us free 
 How could we forget 
 When You touched the earth on that starry night 
 Angels sang glory to God on high?

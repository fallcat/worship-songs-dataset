What's a man to do 
 When every dream he's chased comes true 
 All the trophies on a wall 
 Are gonna lose their shine and fall 
 What's a stage played on 
 If we don't give You every song 
 All the cheers and the applause 
 In the arena they'll be lost 
 What will they think about the things I did 
 What will they say about the life I've lived 
 I want them to say... 
 He's the one whose faith didn't fade 
 When everything crashed, he didn't cave 
 He never lost his awe and wonder 
 The one that kept me from going under 
 And he ran a good race 
 That's what I want, what I want, I want them to say 
 What if they all know my name 
 But never see beyond my face 
 A pointless legacy 
 There so much more inside of me 
 He fights for the weak 
 Has arms that reach out for Jesus 
 Every word that he speaks 
 Helps me to believe there's a God that loves us 
 Oh Lord, I want You to say...

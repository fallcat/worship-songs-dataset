When the boys light up, light up 
 When the boys light up, light up 
 When the boys light up, light up 
 Back and forth like a daytime drama 
 Up and down like a yo-yo mama 
 Say there's gonna be days like this 
 'Cause light and dark don't coexist 
 How you gonna see through this fog? 
 How you gonna get back on course? 
 You ain't never gonna feel the force 
 If you don't connect to a power source 
 'Cause you been swapping out day for night 
 But you see a lamp light burning bright 
 If you get your flip-flops off the porch 
 We're passing you the torch 
 When the boys light up, you know 
 Who gets the praise who owns the show 
 When the boys light up, it's on 
 We ain't stopping till we're done 
 We ain't nothing but the conduits 
 He's got the power, He'll flip the switch 
 Leaving the dark behind 
 Light up and let it shine 
 When the boys light up, light up 
 When the boys light up, light up 
 I was feeling all overcome 
 Had a faith gone dim and then some 
 Gotta call from a band of brothers 
 Turn the mic on, flash the Nikons 
 All the doubters, I heard 'em say 
 Now the band's gonna fade away 
 But the boys are back for a second act 
 No excuses, we're lighting fuses 
 You're in the dawn of your finest hour 
 So get wired to the highest power 
 If you're down pick any sight 
 Get ready to ignite 
 When the boys light up, you know 
 Who gets the praise who owns the show 
 When the boys light up, it's on 
 We ain't stopping till we're done 
 If we ain't nothing but the conduits 
 He's got the power, He'll flip the switch 
 Leaving the dark behind 
 Light up and let it shine 
 When we walk in His footsteps 
 It's a brighter day 
 When we follow His word 
 He lights the way 
 When we lift up His banner and raise it high 
 We light up the sky 
 When the boys light up, light up 
 When the boys light up, light up 
 When the boys light up, you know 
 Who gets the praise who owns the show 
 When the boys light up, it's on 
 We ain't stopping till we're done 
 We ain't nothing but the conduits 
 He's got the power, He'll flip the switch 
 Leaving the dark behind 
 When the boys light up, you know 
 Who gets the praise who owns the show 
 When the boys light up, it's on 
 We ain't stopping till we're done 
 We ain't nothing but the conduits 
 He's got the power, He'll flip the switch 
 Leaving the dark behind 
 Light up and let it shine

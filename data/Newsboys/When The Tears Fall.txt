I've had questions, without answers 
 I've known sorrow, I have known pain 
 But there's one thing, that I'll cling to 
 You are faithful, Jesus You're true 
 When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour 
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer 
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart 
 In the lone hour of my sorrow 
 Through the darkest night of my soul 
 You surround me and sustain me 
 My defender, forevermore 
 When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour 
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer 
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart 
 And I will praise You, I will praise You 
 When the tears fall, still I will sing to You 
 And I will praise You, Jesus praise You 
 Through the suffering still I will sing 
 When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour 
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer 
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart 
 Oh yes, You are good to me 
 You've always been good to me 
 So trustworthy 
 When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour 
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer 
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart 
 And I will praise You, and I will praise You 
 When the tears fall, still I will sing to You 
 (I will sing to You) I will praise You, 
 Jesus praise You through the suffering 
 Still I will sing 
 How faithful and true 
 Sustain me through and through 
 You are hope and truth 
 You must bring a little water 
 You must bring a little water 
 In the lone hour of my sorrow 
 Who springs never fail 
 Be faithful and true 
 Like... 
 Like a spring it never fails 
 You're my spring never fails

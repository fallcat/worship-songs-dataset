I want to preach the Word 
 They want massages 
 I check chapter and verse 
 They check their watches 
 I spy another yawn 
 I might as well be gone 
 Let's stand and say "Amen" 
 Some days I must admit 
 I still don't get this 
 Could be it's time to quit 
 When days get like this 
 I slip into the night 
 Then stumble towards the light 
 Wake up and try again 
 When You called my name 
 I didn't know how far the calling went 
 When You called my name 
 I didn't know what that word really meant 
 When I recall Your call 
 I feel 
 So small 
 Could be I'm losing touch 
 Could be they don't care 
 Lord knows I don't know much 
 Lord knows I've been there 
 I trip toward my retreat 
 I fall down at Your feet 
 Get up and try again 
 When You called my name 
 I didn't know how far the calling went 
 When You called my name 
 I didn't know what that word really meant 
 When I recall Your call 
 I feel 
 So small 
 Lord, what did You see 
 When You called out for me? 
 I start losing heart 
 And then 
 It comes again 
 Lifted from despair 
 By the prayers of someone 
 Lifted from despair 
 By the prayers of someone

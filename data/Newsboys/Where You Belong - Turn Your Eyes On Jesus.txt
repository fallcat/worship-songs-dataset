When you're dull from all that glitters, 
 When your thoughts have a hollow ring, 
 When you can't escape from the feeling you're getting it wrong... 
 All your foolproof plans seem foolish, 
 All your status is status quo, 
 All you really need to know is where you belong. 
 Turn your eyes upon Jesus. 
 Look full in his wonderful face. 
 And the things of earth will grow strangely dim 
 In the light of his glory and grace. 
 I was used to the cold for so long that couldn't feel anything. 
 And I shivered and stared like a beggar who won't lift his hands. 
 I was numb until he touched me. 
 I was deaf until he heard. 
 I was senseless till I met the one who understands. 
 Turn your eyes upon Jesus. 
 Look full in his wonderful face. 
 And the things of earth will grow strangely dim 
 In the light of his glory and grace.

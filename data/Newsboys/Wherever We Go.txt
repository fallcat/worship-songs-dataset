Go album version: 
 Wherever we go, bluebirds sing 
 And the flowers bloom 
 And the grass gets green 
 It's a curious thing 
 But it's just our thing 
 Wherever we go, the bees behave 
 In the treetops, squirrels smile and wave 
 It's a curious thing 
 And it's humbling 
 Where we go, little glow-worms glow 
 Little roadrunners run ahead 
 Gonna tell their friends 
 Little mice, little men 
 Got 'em all excited 
 All invited 
 Hands up 
 Holler back here 
 Let's throw this party in gear 
 We brought the welcome mat 
 Wherever we go, that's where the party's at 
 Hands up 
 Holler back now 
 We don't claim any know-how 
 We're giving God all that 
 Wherever we go, that's where the party's at 
 Wherever we go, the dumb get wise 
 And the crime rates drop 
 And the markets rise 
 It's a curious thing 
 But it's just our thing 
 Bullies make nice, crooks repent 
 And the ozone layer shows improvement 
 It's a curious thing 
 And it's humbling 
 Wherever we're led 
 All the Living Dead 
 Wanna leave their Zombie Mob 
 It's a touching scene when they all come clean 
 God helps us, we just love our job

 (Throw your hands up high) 
 (High, throw your hands up,) 
 (Throw your hands up, high.) 
 (High, throw your hands up,) 
 (Throw your hands up, high.) 
 This is the message we spread, 
 Bringin' life to the dead. 
 This is the Gospel expo, 
 Follows wherever we go.

 Bringin' life to the dead.

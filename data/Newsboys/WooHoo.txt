Request the honor of your presence 
 The tear gas has blown away 
 Put down your crumpets and your coffee now 
 So unfashionably late 
 Little brother, little sister 
 Underwater we go 
 Out of our ordinary selves 
 Stepping out 
 To where the people sing 
 WooHoo, and the people sing 
 And the times are good 
 WooHoo, and the people sing 
 And the times are good 
 You say I'm acting like a beggar 
 I call it killing the fool 
 You carry more baggage 
 Than a momma's boy 
 On your first day of school, say 
 Little brother, little sister 
 Underwater we go 
 Out of our ordinary selves 
 Stepping out 
 To where the people sing 
 WooHoo, and the people sing 
 And the times are good 
 WooHoo, and the people sing 
 And the times are good 
 Let go of the light of the TV 
 Drop the hands 
 The chains that bind me 
 Turn it all around 
 Stop, lift you up 'n die to self 
 In a time when the left and the right's the same 
 When it's all blurred vision in a crazy haze 
 Let's send out the invitations 
 (Let's send out the invitation) 
 You say I'm acting like a beggar 
 I call it killing the fool 
 To save your life you gotta lose it 
 So the people sing 
 WooHoo, and the people sing 
 And the times are good 
 WooHoo, and the people sing 
 And the times are good

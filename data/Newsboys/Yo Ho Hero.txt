Raise the mast on the steadfast! 
 Swept to their bareback seahorse 
 Say they gonna try the sea course 
 Who could survive such a dangerous mission 
 Alongside pirates with zero ambition 
 We got the coconuts poured 
 We drop the hooks overboard 
 And if you get a little seasick 
 We play the Haddock for a Hat trick 
 We got the hammocks on the main deck 
 Swingin' low 
 We got the butler doin' the hen-peck 
 Screamin' so 
 He say we shoulda been swabbin' the poop deck 
 We dunno 
 It's what the other pirates do do 
 But we're bringin' you 
 Yo ho heroes 
 Standin' in the gap 
 Where'd you put the toys 
 Time to take a nap 
 Yo Ho heroes 
 Flighty as a bird 
 Easy is the word 
 Yo, I'm seein' no heroes 
 We're on a limbo craze 
 It's a relic from our limber days 
 Now we're stuck inside the Limbo-Zone 
 Its where the pirates go with too much time and a missing spine 
 Yo ho heroes 
 Standing in the gap 
 Where'd you put the map 
 Take another nap 
 Yo ho heroes 
 Strike a better pose 
 That's the way it goes 
 Yo, I'm seein' no heroes 
 We're on the Bad Mood Swing 
 We haven't done one thing 
 Not even a minimum daily requirement 
 We got the funk without the Parliament 
 And if you're feelin' a little seasick 
 Rise and shine 
 And if you wanna get off the guilt trip 
 Now's the time 
 Because the Captain of the Main Ship 
 Rings the chime 
 He could be comin' before you know Him 
 What are you gonna show Him 
 Go hero 
 Standing in the gap 
 Takin' up the slack 
 Followin' the King's Map 
 Go hero 
 Steady as a rock 
 I know it's a shock 
 Yo, there be a hero 
 Go hero 
 Standin' in the gap 
 Takin' up the slack 
 Followin' the King's Map 
 Go hero 
 Steady at the wheel 
 Keep an even keel 
 Yo, there be the King's hero

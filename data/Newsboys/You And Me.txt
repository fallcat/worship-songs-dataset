There was a time 
 When time was mine 
 I never lived for you 
 I couldn't see 
 That you and me 
 Were ever meant to be 
 You and me were meant to be 
 You had a plan but I couldn't see 
 You and me were meant to be 
 You had a plan but I couldn't see 
 I looked today 
 And saw the way 
 The way I used to be 
 Your hand reached out 
 You lifted me 
 From the miry day 
 You and me were meant to be 
 You got a plan and now I see

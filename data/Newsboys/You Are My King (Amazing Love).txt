I'm forgiven because you were forsaken 
 I'm accepted, you were condemned 
 I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me 
 Because you died and rose again 
 Amazing love, how can it be 
 That You, my King, should die for me? 
 Amazing love, I know it's true 
 It's my joy to honor you 
 In all I do, to honor you 
 You are my King 
 Jesus, You are my King 
 You are my King

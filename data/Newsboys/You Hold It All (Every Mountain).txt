From the highest of mountains 
 To the depths of the sea 
 From the planets in motion 
 To the breath that we breathe 
 From the womb of the barren 
 To the rich and the poor 
 To the dreams of the orphan 
 Every heart beat is Yours 
 You hold it all 
 (Every mountain, every valley) 
 You hold it all 
 (Every tear drop, every heartbeat) 
 In my weakness 
 You're my victory 
 In my sickness 
 You surround me 
 I believe that You hold it all 
 It's in the roar of the lions 
 It's in the wind and the waves 
 It's in the glory of sunrise 
 And the lives that You change 
 You stand alone in splendor 
 You reign in majesty 
 Your hands formed all creation 
 Your hands are holding me 
 You are my hope forever 
 You are the sovereign King 
 You are my friend and Savior 
 I believe that... 
 I believe that You hold us all 
 (Every mother, every father) 
 You hold us all 
 (Every son and every daughter) 
 You hold us all 
 (Every saint, every sinner) 
 (You are sovereign) 
 (You're forever) 
 We believe that You hold us all 
 Yes, You hold us all

I lay on my bed 
 I try to sleep 
 My eyes won't close 
 My mind so deep 
 You're still there 
 You still care - 
 Why do you draw me 
 You never left me 
 Time after time I've tried to make it alone 
 I felt like my life was failure prone 
 But you're still there 
 You still care 
 - You wait and see, you cry for me 
 Why do you draw me 
 You never left me 
 And when my life it has come to a close 
 I've run the good race and defeated my foes 
 You'll be there and you'll still care 
 You wait and see you cry for me 
 Why did you draw me, you never left me 
 Praise you

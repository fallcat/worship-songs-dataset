Go album version: 
 I dunno nothing that I haven't been taught, I dunno 
 Why I was born into the family I've got, I dunno 
 If I ever had an original thought, 
 Maybe not, maybe so, maybe later, I dunno 
 I dunno 
 How I can end a prayer, then turn on a friend, I dunno 
 What I was thinking when I just pressed SEND, I dunno 
 Why I still criticize the things I dunno 
 I dunno, I dunno, I dunno,  but this one thing I know 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, I'm just a broken machine 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, it's all a mindless routine 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, I'm in another free fall 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, I've got nothing at all, yeah 
 I dunno what goes down the moment we die 
 Do we get halos & harps 
 Do we sleep? Do we fly? I dunno 
 How, when and why this world will finally end, 
 Speculation's gonna grow, who knows best, I dunno 
 I dunno 
 If I should push ahead or stop and grieve, 
 I lie awake and wonder how to make a city believe, 
 I dunno 
 When it's a ministry and when it's a show 
 Maybe neither, maybe both, I dunno, but this one thing I know 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, I'm just a broken machine 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your touch I'm not a full human being 
 Your love is better than life 
 If I should ever leave, where would I go? 
 Your love is better than life 
 I look to You 'cause You're the lover of my soul 
 Here's to the lover of my soul 
 Here's to the lover of my soul 
 I dunno when to walk away or stand and fight 
 Just when I've got it wrong, I'm sure I heard You right 
 And when my arguments are watertight 
 You expose every hole 
 With a flash and a flood 
 And I know 
 I hear You call in the eye of the storm 
 And I know 
 You've had my back since the day I was born 
 Still stoking my heart 
 Still stirring my head 
 You're my pillar of fire 
 You're the wine, You're the bread, and 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, I'm just a broken machine 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, it's all a mindless routine 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, I'm in another free fall 
 Your love is better than life 
 Without Your love, I've got nothing at all 
 Your love is better than life 
 I dunno why I was born into the family I've got, I dunno 
 Your love is better than life 
 If I ever had an original thought, 
 Your love is better than life 
 Maybe not, maybe so, maybe soon, maybe later, I dunno 
 Your love is better than life 
 I dunno when I've got it right or wrong, I dunno 
 Your love is better than life 
 How I can wrap it in a four minute song, but I know 
 Your love is better than life 
 My grip is better when I'm not hanging on, Your love is making us strong 
 Your love is better than life

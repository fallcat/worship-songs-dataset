Nothing can separate 
 Even if I run away 
 Your love never fails 
 I know I'll still make mistakes 
 You have new mercy for me every day 
 Cause Your love never fails 
 Oh no, no, no 
 You stay the same through the ages 
 Your love never changes 
 There may be pain in the night 
 But joy comes in the morning 
 When the storm and the water's deep 
 I'm not alone here in these open seas 
 Cause Your love never fails 
 The chasm is far too wide 
 I never thought I'd reach the other side 
 Your love ever fails 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Yeah, You stay the same through the ages 
 Your love never changes 
 There may be pain in the night 
 But joy comes in the morning 
 And when the oceans rage 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 Because I know that You love me 
 Your love never fails 
 You make all things 
 Work together for my good 
 (God, You never fail me) 
 You make all things 
 Work together for my good 
 (No You never fail me) 
 You stay the same through the ages 
 Your love never changes 
 There may be pain in the night 
 But joy comes in the morning 
 And when the oceans rage 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 Because I know that You love me 
 Your love never fails 
 Cause Your love never fails

Bless the day 
 This restoration is complete 
 Dirty dusty something must be underneath 
 So I scrape and I scuff 
 Though it's never quite enough 
 I'm starting to see me finally 
 A gallery of paintings new and paintings old 
 I guess it's no surprise that I'm no Michael angelo 
 Every layer of mine hides a lovely design 
 It might take a little patience 
 It might take a little time 
 But you called me beautiful 
 When you saw my shame 
 And you placed me on the wall 
 Anyway 
 You who have begun this work will someday see 
 A portrait of the holiness you meant for me 
 So I polish and shine 
 Till it's easier to find even an outline of mine 
 But you called me beautiful 
 When you saw my shame 
 And you placed me on the wall 
 Anyway 
 Anyway 
 And you placed me on the wall 
 Anyway

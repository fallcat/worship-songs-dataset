As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
 And the rose buds know to bloom in early May 
 Just as hate knows love's the cure 
 You can rest your mind assure 
 That I'll be loving you always 
 As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow 
 But in passing we'll grow older every day 
 Just as all that's born is new 
 You know what I say is true 
 That I'll be loving you always 
 Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky, always 
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high, always 
 Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea, always 
 Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 
 Did you know true love asks for nothing 
 And acceptance is the way we pay? 
 Did you know life has given love a guarantee 
 To last through forever and another day? 
 Just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
 And the seasons know exactly when to change 
 Just as kindness knows no shame 
 Know through all your joy and pain 
 That I'll be loving you always 
 Until the day is night and night becomes the day, always 
 Until the trees and seas just up and fly away, always 
 Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, always 
 Until the day that is the day that are no more 
 As today I know I'm living, but tomorrow 
 Could make me the past, but that I mustn't fear 
 For I know deep in my mind 
 The love of me I've left behind 
 'Cause I'll be loving you always 
 Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky, always 
 Until the ocean covers every mountain high, always 
 Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea, always 
 Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 
 We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles 
 Can make you wish you were born in another time and space 
 But you can bet your life times that and twice its double 
 That God knew right where He wanted you to be placed 
 Until the day is night and night becomes the day, always 
 Until the trees and seas just up and fly away, always 
 Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, always 
 Until the day that is the day that are no more 
 Always

The gate is wide 
 The road is paved in moderation 
 The crowd is kind and quick to pull you in 
 Welcome to the middle ground 
 You're safe and sound and 
 Until now, it's where I've been 
 'Cause it's been fear that ties me down to everything 
 But it's been love, your love, that cuts the strings 
 So long status quo 
 I think I just let go 
 You make me want to be brave 
 The way it always was 
 Is no longer good enough 
 You make me want to be brave 
 Brave, brave 
 I am small 
 And I speak when I'm spoken to 
 But I am willing to risk it all 
 I say your name 
 Just your name and I'm ready to jump 
 Even ready to fall 
 Why did I take this vow of compromise? 
 Why did I try to keep it all inside? 
 I've never known a fire that didn't begin with a flame 
 Every storm will start with just a drop of rain 
 But if you believe in me, that changes everything

Started rubbing sticks together 
 I thought a spark would take forever 
 I never dreamt this fire would appear 
 When Moses saw the Bush in flames 
 And heard the branches speak his name 
 I wonder if he felt this kind of fear 
 'Cause I'm burnin' 
 Yeah, I'm burnin' 
 And I know I'm gonna blister in these flames 
 So I'll stay here 
 Till this smoke clears 
 And I'll find you in the ashes that remain 
 Used to be that I could say 
 My faith was one arm's length away 
 From any flame that ever felt too warm 
 Asked for matches, but I received 
 A gallon full of gasoline 
 Now my cozy campfire days are gone 
 'Cause I'm burnin' 
 Yeah I'm burnin' 
 And I know I'm gonna blister in these flames 
 So I'll stay here 
 Till this smoke clears 
 And I'll find you in the ashes that remain 
 'Knock with caution at the door' 
 They said, 'Beware of what you're praying for' 
 So I'll stand here with my whole desire 
 In the middle of this forest fire 
 Till I've nothing left to show 
 And new life begins to grow...

One choice 
 One tree 
 One fall for humanity 
 One lie 
 One liar 
 One bite is all death required 
 One great regret 
 One squandered chance, and yet 
 One hope 
 One day 
 One name above all other names 
 One bridge between then and now 
 One way to discover how 
 One price 
 One tree 
 One drop of crimson covers me

It's a fear that keeps me wide awake 
 In the middle of the night 
 When the expectations are too great 
 And the bar gets raised too high 
 So I do the best with what I've got 
 And hope that no one knows 
 That I strain to see how high I can 
 Try to stand on these toes 
 Until I'm measured, but You know better 
 So, thank You, Jesus 
 Even when You see us just as we are 
 Fragile and frail and so far 
 From who we want to be 
 So, thank You, Jesus 
 Even when the pieces are broken and small 
 Dreams shatter and scatter like the wind 
 Thank You, even then 
 So I put aside the masquerade 
 And admit that I am not okay 
 Which may not be the thing to say 
 But I'm not ashamed to need 
 You more each day 
 So, thank You, Jesus 
 Even when You see us just as we are 
 Fragile and frail and so far 
 From who we want to be 
 So, thank You, Jesus 
 Even when the pieces are broken and small 
 Dreams shatter and scatter like the wind 
 Thank You, even then 
 We raise the standard 
 And try to reach You 
 But we'll never make it 
 And we don't need to 
 So, thank You 
 Just as we are 
 'Cause we are fragile 
 And frail and so far 
 From who we want to be 
 So, thank You, Jesus 
 Even when the pieces are broken and small 
 Dreams shatter and scatter like the wind 
 Thank You, even then

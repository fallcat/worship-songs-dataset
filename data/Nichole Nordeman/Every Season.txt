Every evening sky, an invitation 
 To trace the patterned stars 
 And early in July, a celebration 
 For freedom that is ours 
 And I notice You in children's games 
 In those who watch them from the shade 
 Every drop of sun is full of fun and wonder 
 You are summer 
 And even when the trees have just surrendered 
 To the harvest time 
 Forfeiting their leaves in late September 
 And sending us inside 
 Still I notice You when change begins 
 And I am braced for colder winds 
 I will offer thanks for what has been and what's to come 
 You are autumn 
 And everything in time and under Heaven 
 Finally falls asleep 
 Wrapped in blankets white, all creation 
 Shivers underneath 
 And still I notice You when branches crack 
 And in my breath on frosted glass 
 Even now in death, You open doors for life to enter 
 You are winter 
 And everything that's new has bravely surfaced 
 Teaching us to breathe 
 And what was frozen through is newly purposed 
 Turning all things green 
 So it is with You and how You make me new 
 With every season's change 
 And so it will be as You are re-creating me 
 Summer, autumn, winter, spring

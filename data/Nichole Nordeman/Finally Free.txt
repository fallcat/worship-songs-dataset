No chain is strong enough 
 No choice is wrong enough 
 No mountain high enough that He can't climb 
 No shadow dark enough 
 No night is black enough 
 No road is lost enough that He can't find 
 And if the Son has set us free 
 Then we must be, free indeed 
 Let the chains fall away, starting today 
 Everything has changed 
 I'm finally free 
 No pain is deep enough 
 No heart could bleed enough 
 Nothing but Jesus' love can make a way 
 And if the Son has set us free 
 Then we must be, free indeed 
 Let the chains fall away, starting today 
 Everything has changed 
 I'm finally free

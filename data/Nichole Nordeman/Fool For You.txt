There are times when faith 
 And common sense do not align 
 When hardcore evidence of you 
 Is hard to find 
 And I am silenced in the face 
 Of argumentative debate 
 And it's a long hill 
 It's a lonely climb 
 'Cause they want proof 
 They want proof of 
 All these mysteries I claim 
 'Cause only fools would want 
 To chant a dead man's name 
 Maybe it's true, yeah, but 
 I would be a fool for you 
 (A fool for you) 
 All because you asked me to 
 A simpleton who's seemingly naïve 
 I do believe you came and 
 Made yourself a fool for me 
 I admit that in my darkest hours 
 I've asked what if 
 What if we created some kind of 
 Man made faith like this 
 Out of good intention 
 Or emotional invention 
 And after life is through 
 There will be no you 
 'Cause they want proof 
 Of all these miracles I claim 
 'Cause only fools believe 
 That men can walk on waves 
 Maybe it's true, yeah, but 
 I would be a fool for you 
 (A fool for you) 
 All because you asked me to 
 A simpleton who's seemingly naïve 
 I do believe you came and 
 Made yourself a fool for me 
 Unaware of popularity 
 And unconcerned with dignity 
 You made me free 
 That's proof enough for me 
 I would be a fool for you 
 (A fool for you) 
 Only if you asked me to 
 A simpleton who's only thinkin' of 
 The cause of love 
 I will speak Jesus' name 
 (A fool for you) 
 If that makes me crazy 
 They can call me crazed 
 I'm happy to be seemingly naïve 
 I do believe you came and 
 Made yourself a fool for me 
 A fool for you

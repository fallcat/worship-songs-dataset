Do I dare even where what I was thinking of? 
 My true colors bleeding on my sleeve 
 Do I chance the romance that I've been dreaming of 
 Instead of wishing for it quitely 
 Always at a distance, 
 I wish You'd safely stayed 
 Despite my resistance 
 You sought me anyway 
 Gone are the days, 
 Of all that I was afraid of 
 I've left behind the traces of who I've been 
 I'm no longer able 
 To wrestle with this angel 
 And the closer You get I can let You love me 
 I had found it was easier to dance around 
 The edges of who I could be 
 If I chose to expose what grows deep down 
 Would You still desire what You see? 
 No more self-rejection 
 No longer paralized 
 This holy perfection 
 Is my inside Your eyes 
 Gone are the days, 
 Of all that I was afraid of 
 I've left behind the traces of who I've been 
 I'm no longer able 
 To wrestle with this angel 
 And the closer You get I can let You love me (You love me) 
 Nevermind this mirror hanging on the wall 
 'Cause I could not pretend to be the fairest of them all 
 Took a hammer to the glass 
 To shatter all the pieces, the pieces of my past 
 Gone are the days, 
 Of all that I was afraid of 
 I've left behind the traces of who I've been 
 I'm no longer able 
 To wrestle with this angel 
 And the closer You get I can let You love me (repeat until fade)

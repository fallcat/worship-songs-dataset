Send some rain, would You send some rain? 
 'Cause the earth is dry and needs to drink again 
 And the sun is high and we are sinking in the shade 
 Would You send a cloud, thunder long and loud? 
 Let the sky grow black and send some mercy down 
 Surely You can see that we are thirsty and afraid 
 But maybe not, not today 
 Maybe You'll provide in other ways 
 And if that's the case ... 
 We'll give thanks to You with gratitude 
 For lessons learned in how to thirst for You 
 How to bless the very sun that warms our face 
 If You never send us rain 
 Daily bread, give us daily bread 
 Bless our bodies, keep our children fed 
 Fill our cups, then fill them up again tonight 
 Wrap us up and warm us through 
 Tucked away beneath our sturdy roofs 
 Let us slumber safe from danger's view this time 
 Or maybe not, not today 
 Maybe You'll provide in other ways 
 And if that's the case ... 
 We'll give thanks to You with gratitude 
 A lesson learned to hunger after You 
 That a starry sky offers a better view 
 If no roof is overhead 
 And if we never taste that bread 
 Oh, the differences that often are between 
 Everything we want and what we really need 
 So grant us peace, Jesus, grant us peace 
 Move our hearts to hear a single beat 
 Between alibis and enemies tonight 
 Or maybe not, not today 
 Peace might be another world away 
 And if that's the case ... 
 We'll give thanks to You with gratitude 
 For lessons learned in how to trust in You 
 That we are blessed beyond what we could ever dream 
 In abundance or in need 
 And if You never grant us peace ... 
 But, Jesus, would You please ...

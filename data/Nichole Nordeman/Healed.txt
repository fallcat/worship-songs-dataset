We stutter and we stammer till You say us 
 A symphony of chaos till You play us 
 Phrases on the pages of unknown 
 Till You read us into poetry and prose 
 We are kept and we are captive till You free us 
 Vaguely unimagined till You dream us 
 Aimlessly unguided till You lead us home 
 By Your voice, we speak 
 By Your strength, no longer weak 
 We are no longer weak 
 By Your wounds we are healed 
 By Your wounds we are healed 
 Passed over and passed by until You claim us 
 Orphaned and abandoned till You name us 
 Hidden and disclosed till You expose our hearts 
 By Your death we live 
 It is by Your gift that we might give 
 That we might give 
 By Your wounds we are healed 
 (Tell me what kind of love is this...) 
 By Your wounds we are healed 
 What kind of love would take Your shame 
 And spill His blood for You 
 And save us by His wounds? 
 By Your wounds we are healed 
 (Tell me what kind of love is this...) 
 By Your wounds we are healed

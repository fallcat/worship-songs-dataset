Take me back to the time 
 When I was maybe eight or nine 
 And I believed 
 When Jesus walked on waters blue 
 And if He helped me, I could too 
 If I believed 
 Before rationale, analysis and systematic thinking 
 Robbed me of a sweet simplicity 
 When wonders and when mysteries 
 Were far less often silly dreams 
 And childhood fantasies 
 Help me believe 
 'Cause I don't want to miss any miracles 
 Maybe I'd see much better by closing my eyes 
 And I would shed this grownup skin I'm in 
 To touch an angel's wing 
 And I would be free 
 Help me believe 
 When mustard seeds made mountains move 
 A burning bush that spoke for You, was good enough 
 When manna fell from heavens high 
 Just because You told the sky to open up 
 Am I too wise to recognise that everything uncertain 
 Is certainly a possibility 
 When logic fails my reasoning 
 And science crushes underneath 
 The weight of all that is unseen 
 Help me believe 
 'Cause I don't want to miss any miracles 
 Maybe I'd see much better by closing my eyes 
 And I would shed this grownup skin I'm in 
 To touch an angel's wing 
 And I would be free 
 Help me believe 
 When someone else's education 
 Plays upon my reservations 
 I'm the first to cave, I'm the first to bleed 
 If I abandon all that seeks 
 To make my faith, informed and chic 
 Could You, would You show Yourself to me 
 (Help me believe, 'cause I don't want to miss any miracles) 
 Maybe I'd see much better by closing my eyes 
 And I would shed this grownup skin I'm in 
 To touch one of their wings 
 And I would be free 
 I would be free 
 I would be free 
 Help me believe 
 Help me believe 
 Could You, would You show Yourself to me 
 Could You, would You shoy Yourself to me 
 Help me believe

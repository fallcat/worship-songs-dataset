It will find you at the bottom of a bottle 
 It will find you at the needle's end 
 It will find you when you beg and steal and borrow 
 It will follow you into a stranger's bed 
 It will find you when they serve you with the papers 
 It will find you when the locks have changed again 
 It will find you when you've called in all your favors 
 It will meet you at the bridge's highest ledge 
 So baby don't look down, it's a long way 
 The sun will come around to a new day 
 So hold on 
 Love will find you 
 Hold on 
 He's right behind you now 
 Just turn around 
 And love will find you 
 It will find you when the doctor's head is shaking 
 It will find you in a boardroom, mostly dead 
 It will crawl into the foxhole where you're praying 
 It will curl up in your halfway empty bed 
 So baby don't believe that it's over 
 Maybe you can't see 'round the corner? 
 To hang between two thieves in the darkness 
 Love must believe you are worth it

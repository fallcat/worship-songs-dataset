Na…na….holy 
 How many roads did I travel 
 Before I walked down one that led me to You? 
 How many dreams did unravel 
 Before I believed in a hope that was true? 
 And how long?  How far? 
 What was meant to fulfill only emptied me still 
 And all You ever wanted 
 Only me, on my knees 
 Singing, “Holy, holy” 
 And somehow all that matters now is 
 You are holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 How many deaths did I die 
 Before I was awakened to new life again? 
 And how many half-truths did I bear witness to 
 'Til the proof was disproved in the end? 
 And how long?  How far? 
 What was meant to illuminate, shadowed me still 
 And all You ever wanted 
 Only me, on my knees 
 Singing, “Holy, holy” 
 And somehow all that matters now is 
 You are holy, holy 
 And all I have is gratitude to offer You 
 You are holy, holy 
 And somehow all that matters now is 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 Holy 
 And somehow all that matters now is 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 Only me, on my knees 
 Singing, “Holy, holy” 
 And somehow all that matters now is 
 You are holy, holy, holy , holy 
 Holy

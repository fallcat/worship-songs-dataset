Bright are the stars that shine in somebody else's sky 
 Green is the grass that grows some place different 
 More possibilities, more than You offered me 
 More than I care to see from a distance 
 I was certain that the truth would be 
 In a place that kept eluding me 
 But every stone turned and unturned again 
 Would only serve to prove 
 That I never had to move to find You 
 And You will always be 
 The only love I'll ever know, home 
 And You have made for me 
 The only place I'll ever go, home 
 God, for the shameless pride 
 The times when I rolled my eyes 
 To laugh at simplicity, show me mercy 
 Knowing what I know now it's hard to imagine how 
 I could feel anything but unworthy 
 And the mystery of Your love for me 
 Is not as hidden as it seemed to be 
 Should have known then when You said to me 
 "Seek and you will find" 
 It was right here all the time 
 And You will always be 
 The only love I'll ever know, home 
 And You have made for me 
 The only place I'll ever go, home 
 I believe in the quest and the journey 
 I believe that the answers come in time 
 And where we begin is where we arrive 
 And You will always be 
 The only love I'll ever know, home 
 And You have made for me 
 The only place I'll ever go, home

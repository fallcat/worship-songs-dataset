Pencil marks on a wall 
 I wasn't always this tall 
 You scattered some monsters 
 From beneath my bed 
 You watched my team win 
 You watched my team lose 
 Watched when my bicycle 
 Went down again 
 And when I was weak 
 Unable to speak 
 Still I could call You by name 
 And I said 
 Elbow Healer, Superhero 
 Come if You can 
 You said, I Am 
 Only sixteen 
 Life is so mean 
 What kind of curfew 
 Is at 10pm? 
 You saw my mistakes 
 And watched my heart break 
 Heard when I swore 
 I'd never love again 
 And when I was weak 
 Unable to speak 
 Still I could call You by name 
 And I said 
 Heartache Healer, Secret Keeper 
 Be my best friend 
 And You said, I Am 
 You saw me wear white 
 By pale candlelight 
 I said forever 
 To what lies ahead 
 Two kids and a dream 
 With kids that can scream 
 Too much it might seem 
 When it is 2am 
 And when I am weak 
 Unable to speak 
 Still I will call You by name 
 Oh, Shepherd, Savior, Pasture Maker 
 Hold onto my hand 
 You say, I Am 
 The winds of change and circumstance 
 Blow in and all around us 
 So we find a foothold that's familiar 
 And bless the moments 
 That we feel You nearer 
 When life had begun 
 I was woven and spun 
 You let the angels 
 Dance around the throne 
 And who can say when 
 But they'll dance again 
 When I am free 
 And finally headed home 
 I will be weak 
 Unable to speak 
 Still I will call You by name 
 Creator, Maker, Life Sustainer 
 Comforter, Healer, my Redeemer 
 Lord and King, Beginning and the End 
 I Am 
 Yes, I Am

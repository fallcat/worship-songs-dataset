If I tried to tell you 
 If I tried to find a way 
 To explain this freedom 
 Of living underneath this grace 
 Would it be absurd? 
 Can a heart be heard? 
 To think you might see 
 A difference in me... 
 And I wish the same for you 
 Something to hold on to 
 I wish the same for you 
 A chance for love 
 We are not so different 
 Sons and daughters, you and i 
 Facing walls of questions 
 Fearing answers on the other side of eternity... 
 And what the day will bring 
 But I finally found 
 The safe and the sound... 
 To dance in the daylight 
 And not see my shadow 
 To run where I cannot hide 
 In the open wide...

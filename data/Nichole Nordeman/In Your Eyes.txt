Love, I get so lost sometimes 
 Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart 
 When I want to run away 
 I drive off in my car 
 But whichever way I go 
 I come back to the place you are 
 All my instincts they return 
 And the grand facade, so soon will burn 
 Without a noise, without my pride 
 I reach out from the inside 
 In your eyes 
 The light, the heat 
 In your eyes 
 I am complete 
 I see the doorway to a thousand churches 
 In your eyes 
 The resolution of all the fruitless searches 
 Oh, I see the light and the heat 
 Oh, I want to be that complete 
 I want to touch the light 
 The heat I see in your eyes 
 Love, I don't like to see so much pain 
 So much wasted and these moments keep slipping away 
 I get so tired of working so hard for our survival 
 I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive 
 And all my instincts, they return 
 And the grand facade, so soon will burn 
 Without a noise, without my pride 
 I reach out from the inside 
 In your eyes 
 The light, the heat 
 In your eyes 
 I am complete 
 I see the doorway to a thousand churches 
 In your eyes 
 The resolution of all the fruitless searches 
 Oh, I see the light and the heat 
 In your eyes, in your eyes...

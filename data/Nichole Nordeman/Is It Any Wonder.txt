Is it any wonder 
 That she would feel less than real 
 When she reveals what is clearer 
 In her mirror 
 Take a look around her 
 Magazines, glamour queens 
 Waist-line dreams in her diary 
 So inspiring 
 Nobody told her that little girls 
 Don't have to have the softest curls for love 
 So whatever's left inside her 
 Is gonna smile wider, shine brighter 
 Until she gets pulled under 
 Is it any wonder? 
 Is it any wonder 
 That he's obsessed with what is best 
 And nothing less... he's a hero 
 With six zeros 
 Take a look around him 
 His wallet size and what he drives 
 Will symbolise how he's made it 
 How they'll grade it 
 Nobody told him that little boys 
 Don't have to have the fastest toys to win 
 So whatever's left inside him 
 Is gonna keep on tryin' to keep on buyin' 
 Until he gets pulled under 
 Is it any wonder? 
 Will somebody tell her there's a love that can't be glamourized 
 Tell him there's a hope that won't be downsized 
 Someone tell them that the billboards lie 
 All the time 
 'Cause whatever's left inside her 
 Is gonna smile wider 
 And whatever's left inside him 
 Is gonna keep on tryin' 
 Until they get pulled under 
 Is it any wonder?

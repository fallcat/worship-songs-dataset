To every son and daughter 
 Wayward and long gone 
 The love of a father 
 Will leave the light on 
 Tried to throw you off track 
 A needle in a haystack 
 I don't know how you found me 
 Or why you let me come back 
 'Cause it's a long way home when all you're left to carry 
 Is a heart of stone and the weight of most the world 
 And I'd like to? 
 Lay it down a little 
 Lay it down a lot 
 I don't want to hold it anymore 
 Lay it down in pieces 
 Lay it down in whole 
 Everything I've carried on my own 
 Lay it down, lay it down 
 Lay it down, lay it down 
 I spent your money 
 Living on the fringes 
 But you threw a party for me 
 Invited all your big friends 
 And I have learned a little bit about a heavy load 
 All that gleams and glitters is not worth its weight in gold 
 And I know I should?

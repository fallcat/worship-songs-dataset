I don't mind if you've got something nice to say about me 
 And I enjoy an accolade like the rest 
 And you can take my picture and hang it in a gallery 
 Of all the Who's Who's and So-and-So's 
 That used to be the best at such-and-such 
 It wouldn't matter much 
 I won't lie, it feels all right to see your name in lights 
 We all need an "atta-boy" or "atta-girl" 
 But in the end I'd like to hang my hat on more besides 
 The temporary trappings of this world 
 I want to leave a legacy 
 How will they remember me? 
 Did I choose to love? 
 Did I point to You enough 
 To make a mark on things 
 I want to leave an offering 
 A child of mercy and grace 
 Who blessed Your name unapologetically 
 And leave that kind of legacy 
 I don't have to look too far or too long a while 
 To make a lengthy list of all that I enjoy 
 It's an accumulating trinket and a treasure pile 
 Where moth and rust, thieves and such 
 Will soon enough destroy 
 I want to leave a legacy 
 How will they remember me? 
 Did I choose to love? 
 Did I point to You enough 
 To make a mark on things 
 I want to leave an offering 
 A child of mercy and grace 
 Who blessed Your name unapologetically 
 And leave that kind of legacy 
 Not well-traveled, not well-read 
 Not well-to-do or well-bred 
 Just want to hear instead 
 Well done, good and faithful one 
 I want to leave a legacy 
 How will they remember me? 
 Did I choose to love? 
 Did I point to You enough 
 To make a mark on things 
 I want to leave an offering 
 A child of mercy and grace 
 Who blessed Your name unapologetically 
 And leave that kind of legacy 
 I don't mind if you've got something nice to say about me

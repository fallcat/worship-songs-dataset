Did you come that we might just survive? 
 Did you come so we could just get by? 
 Did you walk among us 
 So we might merely limp along beside? 
 I was bound, I have been set free 
 But I have settled for apathy 
 Did you come to make me new 
 And know I'd crawl right back into the skin you found me in? 
 It's where I am, not where I've been 
 You make me want to live 
 You make me want to live 
 You came to shake us 
 And to wake us up to something more 
 Than we'd always settled for 
 And you make me want to live 
 We've all been up on the mountain top 
 A golden glow that's bound to soon wear off 
 Then it's back to the mundane telling tales of glory days 
 When we were hopeful that this change was here to stay 
 So why would a young man 
 Live in a waste land 
 When the castle of his dreams is standing by? 
 Why would a princess 
 Put on an old dress 
 To dance with her beloved and a chance to catch his eye?

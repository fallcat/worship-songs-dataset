I don't need another friend tryin' to tell me something 
 I don't need somebody's expert advice 
 When just another two cents still adds up to nothin' 
 I get away to find a place to close my eyes 
 And I don't need somebody new on the television 
 "Send your money and we'll send you a new life" 
 And I don't need your tried-and-true paperback edition 
 The one that fixed you overnight 
 I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at me 
 Lookin' for love that comes with a guarantee 
 What if I knew all that I need 
 Is held in a hand that'll always offer me this love 
 And I don't have to waste my time wonderin' who will love me 
 I don't need to look for some kind of clue 
 It isn't written in my sign or the stars above me 
 It isn't hidden in the blue 
 I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at me 
 Lookin' for love that comes with a guarantee 
 What if I knew all that I need 
 Is held in a hand that'll always offer me this love 
 I'm not tryin' to set an expectation 
 I'm not askin' for the moon 
 I just need a little confirmation, something true 
 I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at me 
 Lookin' for love that comes with a guarantee 
 What if I knew all that I need 
 Is held in a hand that'll always offer me this love

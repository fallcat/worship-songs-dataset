There's a mother on her knees 
 Somewhere in San Francisco 
 Looking up and begging 
 Please God, do not forget me now 
 Her baby's on machines 
 'Cause his heart can not keep beating 
 And she knows what desperate means 
 'Cause the clock is ticking down, down 
 And hope rushed in like waves 
 That someone might just save the day 
 And if heaven's just a prayer away 
 Then why she cries, would God not change things? 
 It may be miles and miles before the journey's clear 
 There may be rivers, may be oceans of tears 
 But the very hand that shields your eyes from understanding 
 Is the hand that will be holding you for miles 
 There's another mother on her knees 
 Somewhere in San Francisco 
 Looking up and begging 
 Please God, do not forget me now 
 It happened like a dream 
 He was laughing, he was running 
 Then she heard the sirens scream 
 When her little boy fell down, down 
 She had never known 
 The agony of letting go 
 But a few miles down the road 
 His heart would find a baby boy just in time 
 One moment someone whispers thank you 
 Just then another heart cries, 'How could you?' 
 When Jesus, who sees us, He says 
 'I hear you, I'm near you' 
 It may be miles and miles before the journey's clear 
 There may be rivers, may be oceans of tears 
 But the very hand that shields your eyes from understanding 
 Is the hand that will be holding you for miles

If You made me like the grass that is green 
 Growing tall; covering the hills above me 
 Maybe I would pray for sunshine and a little rain 
 To fall now and then to make me lovely 
 I could be a place where sheep could graze 
 Or barefoot feet could play 
 And I would grow and grow and hope You'd bend down low 
 To hear me sing my offering 
 Open up the heavens, open up the skies 
 All of Your creation wants to testify 
 I have a song so let the earth sing along 
 'Cause I just want to praise You 
 If You made me to be a cloud in the sky 
 Found the perfect place way up high where I could hover 
 Maybe I would pray for skies that were blue 
 Or a sunset or two to show Your colors 
 Or maybe I might be 
 A mountain strong and steep 
 But I would try and stand as tall as I can 
 And I would sing my offering 
 Open up the heavens, open up the skies 
 All of Your creation wants to testify 
 I have a song so let the earth sing along 
 'Cause I just want to praise You 
 And the sun every morning can not wait to shine 
 And the stars every evening are all standing by to light the sky 
 Give the rocks and the stones voices of their own 
 If we forget to sing praises to our King 
 So open up the heavens, open up the skies 
 All of Your creation wants to testify 
 Hallelujah 
 We just want to praise you 
 We just want to praise you 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Lift up your voice and with us sing 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 I have a song so let the earth sing along 
 'Cause I just want to praise You

Well, you could take a cup and fill it up 
 And just keep on filling till it all comes 
 Spilling down the sides 
 That's what You do in my life 
 Or you could watch the sky at sunrise 
 And see the clouds turn shades I never knew 
 Could make me want to cry 
 That's what You do in my life 
 Never mind moderation 
 You exceed my expectations 
 I have never loved You more 
 'Cause You have never loved me less 
 Than the day before or the day before 
 I have never loved You more 
 Have you ever tried to count the stars way up past Mars? 
 It will blow your mind 
 Don't even try to think about infinity 
 But that's how You love me 
 Much more than I can contain 
 A balloon once tethered to the ground 
 But could not stick around to stay 
 Free to fly away 
 Never mind moderation 
 You exceed my expectations 
 I have never loved You more 
 'Cause You have never loved me less 
 Than the day before or the day before 
 I have never loved You more 
 I have never dared to dream 
 Beyond what I've already seen 
 The day before, or the day before 
 I have never loved You more 
 Exceedingly, abundantly more 
 I have never loved You more 
 'Cause You have never loved me less 
 Than the day before, or the day before 
 I have never loved You more 
 I have never dared to dream 
 Beyond what I've already see 
 The day before, or the day before 
 I have never loved you more

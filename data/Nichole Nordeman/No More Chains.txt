How did I get locked up inside? 
 What's this that renders me paralyzed? 
 I lost myself in small pieces 
 It happened over time 
 I traded love for a heavy chain 
 Another link every other day 
 I pulled it up and down a mountain 
 It made me want to say? 
 No more chains 
 No more chains 
 Big and small, watch them fall away 
 No more chains 
 Big and small, watch them fall away 
 I wonder now if the choice was mine 
 The door was open, I walked inside 
 Nobody had my arm twisted 
 Nobody made me stay 
 The face of freedom can show up small 
 A tiny crack in a prison wall 
 A song that rises up from silence 
 A voice that wants to say? 
 I should let you give me wings 
 I should let you set me free

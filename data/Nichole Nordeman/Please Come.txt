Oh, the days when I drew lines around my faith 
 To keep you out, to keep me in, to keep it safe 
 Oh, the sense of my own self entitlement 
 To say who's wrong or won't belong or cannot stay 
 'Cause somebody somewhere decided 
 We'd be better off divided 
 And somehow despite the damage done 
 He says, "come" ... 
 There is room enough for all of us, please come 
 And the arms are open wide enough, please come 
 And our parts are never greater than the sum 
 This is the heart of the One 
 Who stands before an open door and bids us, "come" 
 Oh, the times when I have failed to recognise 
 How may chairs are gathered there around the feast 
 To break the bread and break these boundaries 
 That have kept us from our only common ground 
 The invitation to sit down 
 If we will come ... 
 There is room enough for all of us, please come 
 And the arms are open wide enough, please come 
 And our parts are never greater than the sum 
 This is the heart of the One 
 Who stands before an open door and bids us, "come" 
 Come, from the best of humanity 
 Come, from the depths of depravity 
 Come now and see how we need 
 Every different bead on this same string 
 Come ... 
 There is room enough for all of us, please come 
 And the arms are open wide enough, please come 
 And our parts are never greater than the sum 
 This is the heart of the One 
 Who stands before an open door and bids us, "come"

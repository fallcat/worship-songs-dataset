Every time I try to find you 
 Every road comes back around 
 Just another hoop to jump through 
 Another mile of covered ground 
 I am weary of the answers 
 More theory and clich√© 
 They raise the letter of the law like a banner 
 'Til you're small and far away 
 All the questions in my head 
 Are from my heart instead 
 Be real to me now 
 That's all I'm asking 
 Be real to me now 
 Every scribe and every scholar 
 No winners in this debate 
 Everybody seems to stand up taller 
 When you're easy to explain 
 I don't need to know what I don't know 
 Just got to let it go 
 Be real to me now 
 That's all I'm asking 
 Be real somehow 
 More than anything 
 More than anything 
 So lay down the sword 
 And put away the doctrine 
 Love a little more, love a little more 
 'Cause everybody's broken

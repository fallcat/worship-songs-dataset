Rolling River God 
 Little Stones are smooth 
 Only once the water passes through 
 So I am a stone 
 Rough and grainy still 
 Trying to reconcile this river's chill 
 But when I close my eyes 
 And feel you rushing by 
 I know that time brings change 
 And change takes time 
 And when the sunset comes 
 My prayer would be this one 
 That you might pick me up 
 And notice that I am 
 Just a little smoother in your hand 
 Sometimes raging wild 
 Sometimes swollen high 
 Never have I known this river dry 
 The deepest part of you 
 Is where I want to stay 
 And feel the sharpest edges wash away 
 And when I close my eyes 
 And feel you rushing by 
 I know that time brings change 
 And change takes time 
 And when the sunset comes 
 My prayer would be just this one 
 That you might pick me up 
 And notice that I am 
 Just a little smoother in your hand

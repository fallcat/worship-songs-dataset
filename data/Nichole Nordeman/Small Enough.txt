Oh great God 
 Be small enough 
 To hear me now 
 There were times when I was crying 
 From the dark of Daniel's den 
 I had asked you once or twice 
 If you would part the sea again 
 Tonight I do not need a 
 Fiery pillar in the sky 
 Just want to know you're gonna 
 Hold me if I start to cry 
 Oh great God 
 Be small enough to hear me now 
 Oh great God 
 Be close enough to feel you now 
 (Oh great god be close to me) 
 There have been moments when I could not face 
 Goliath on my own 
 And how could I forget we marched 
 Around our share of Jerichos 
 But I will not be setting out 
 A fleece for you tonight 
 Just wanna know that everything will be alright 
 Oh great god be close enough to feel me now 
 All praise and all the honor be 
 To the god of ancient mysteries 
 Whose every sign and wonder 
 Turn the pages of our history 
 But tonight my heart is heavy 
 And I cannot keep from whispering this prayer 
 Are you there? 
 And I know you could leave writing 
 On the wall that's just for me 
 Or send wisdom while I'm sleeping 
 Like in Solomon's sweet dreams 
 But I don't need the strength of Sampson 
 Or a chariot in the end 
 Just wanna know that you still know how many 
 Hairs are on my head 
 Oh great God (Are you small enough) 
 Be small enough to hear 
 Me now

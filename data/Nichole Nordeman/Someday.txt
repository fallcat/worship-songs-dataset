I believe in the rest of the story 
 I believe there's still ink in the pen 
 I have wasted my very last day 
 Trying to change what happened way back when 
 I believe it's the human condition 
 We all need to have answers to why 
 More than ever, I'm ready to say that I 
 Will still sleep peacefully 
 With answers out of reach from me until? 
 Someday all that's crazy 
 All that's unexplained 
 Will fall into place 
 And someday all that's hazy 
 Through a clouded glass 
 Will be clear at last 
 And sometimes we're just waiting 
 For someday 
 We are born with a lingering hunger 
 We are born to be unsatisfied 
 We are strangers who can't help but wander 
 And dream about the other side of? 
 Every puzzle's missing piece 
 Every unsolved mystery 
 More than half of every whole 
 Rests in the Hands that hold you for someday?.

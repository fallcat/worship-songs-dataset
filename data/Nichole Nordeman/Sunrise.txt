If I had the chance to go back again 
 Take a different road, bear a lighter load 
 Tell an easy story 
 I would walk away with my yesterdays 
 And I would not trade what is broken 
 For beauty only 
 Every valley, every bitter chill 
 Made me ready to climb back 
 Up the hill and find that 
 You are sunrise 
 You are blue skies 
 How would I know the morning 
 If I knew not midnight? 
 You're my horizon 
 You're the light of a new dawn 
 So thank you, thank you 
 That after the long night, you are sunrise 
 There's a moment when faith caves in 
 There's a time when every soul is certain 
 God is gone 
 But every shadow is evidence of sun 
 And every tomorrow holds out hope for us 
 For every one of us 
 You are sunrise 
 You are blue skies 
 How would I know the morning 
 If I knew not midnight? 
 You alone will shine 
 You alone can resurrect 
 This heart of mine 
 You are sunrise 
 You are blue skies 
 How would I know the morning 
 If I knew not midnight? 
 You are sunrise

Oh, for a heart that does not ache 
 And for a backbone that won't break 
 For some steady feet or sturdy ground 
 A road that isn't gonna let me 
 Turn around and run 
 For a thousand tongues to sing 
 To wear wisdom like Solomon's robe 
 For the patience and perspective 
 Of a man like Job 
 Just to soar on wings of eagles 
 For no other reason 
 Than the bird's eye view 
 For a flight or two 
 And the list gets longer 
 Who I wish I was 
 And was no longer 
 I never could be good enough 
 To measure up 
 But You want to take me as I come 
 You're the only one that can 
 So take me as I am 
 Oh, to feel hope in hopeless times 
 Never mind the silver lining 
 'Cause the clouds are fine 
 To breathe prayers that move the heavens 
 Or save hundreds from the flames 
 To know my place 
 To know my name 
 But the gap grows wider 
 Between who I am 
 And all I aspire to be 
 I never could be good enough 
 To measure up 
 But You want to take me as I come 
 You're the only one that can 
 Take me as I am 
 At the end of myself 
 And the end of the day 
 I can find little else 
 But the courage to say 
 I need You, that's all 
 I need You, that's all 
 I never could be good enough 
 To measure up 
 But You want to take me as I come 
 You're the only one that can 
 Take me as I am

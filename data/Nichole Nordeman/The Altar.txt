I'm at the end of myself 
 I just dropped out of the running 
 I don't recall when I last pulled the shades and said 
 "Here comes the sun, here comes the new day" 
 Someone remind me again that joy might show up on occasion 
 I'm sitting here with my hands on my head 
 And my eyes on the ground, wondering if I'll be found by You 
 Will you make me new? Will you take what's left of me? 
 I guarantee that it won't be a fair trade 
 Will you set me free from what's keeping me afraid? 
 I know I've prayed it all before but I'm back on the altar 
 I don't believe what they say about one foot in front of the other 
 If my life was a map, you'd see every last step just circling around 
 Still lost, never found by You 
 So will you make me new? Will you take what's left of me? 
 I guarantee that it won't be a fair trade 
 Will you set me free from what's keeping me afraid? 
 I know I've prayed it all before but I'm back on the altar 
 Maybe last year I'd have made empty promises 
 Maybe last month I'd have tried to pull strings 
 But I don't have one single chip left to bargain with 
 The only thing left is me needing You to make me new 
 Will you take what's left of me? 
 I guarantee that it won't be a fair trade 
 Will you set me free from what's keeping me afraid? 
 I know I've prayed it all before but I'm back on the altar

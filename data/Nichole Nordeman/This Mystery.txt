Say goodnight 
 To the light 
 Of the setting sun 
 One more day 
 One more way 
 Of keeping track 
 Of all I've done 
 I run this race 
 Keep this pace 
 I'm doing fine 
 And I won't stop 
 Until each box 
 Gets checked a second time 
 And life becomes 
 The round and round 
 Revolving door 
 That won't slow down 
 It won't slow down 
 Do You wish 
 Do You want 
 Us to breathe again? 
 Say goodbye 
 To the lines 
 That we've colored in 
 Brown and grey 
 From day to day, oh 
 Do You cry 
 Do You hope 
 For all things made new? 
 Try and try 
 To invoke us 
 To live in You 
 That we might be 
 The hands and feet 
 Of this mystery 
 This routine 
 Is nice and clean 
 From dawn to dusk 
 I rise and rest 
 I do my best 
 When will it ever be enough? 
 And life becomes 
 The bigger noise 
 Drowning out 
 Your little voice 
 Your little voice, Jesus 
 Do You wish 
 Do You want 
 Us to breathe again? 
 Say goodbye 
 To the lines 
 That we've colored in 
 Brown and grey 
 From day to day, hey, yeah 
 Do You cry 
 Do You hope 
 For all things made new? 
 Try and try 
 To invoke us 
 To live in You 
 That we might be 
 The hands and feet 
 Of this mystery, oh 
 We take stock 
 And we punch the clock 
 And we make sure all those zeros 
 Have balanced in the end 
 And do You wish 
 Do You want 
 Us to breathe again? 
 Say goodbye 
 To the lines 
 That we've colored in 
 Brown and grey 
 Day after day after day 
 Do You cry 
 Do You hope 
 For all things made new? 
 Try and try 
 To invoke us 
 To live in You 
 That we might be 
 The hands and feet 
 Of this mystery, hey, oh 
 That we might be 
 The hands and feet 
 That we might be 
 The hands and feet 
 Of this mystery 
 This mystery

Ooh, it's well past midnight 
 And I'm awake with questions 
 That won't wait for daylight 
 Separating fact from my imaginary fiction 
 On this shelf of my conviction 
 I need to find a place 
 Where You and I come face to face 
 Thomas needed 
 Proof that You had really risen 
 Undefeated 
 When he placed his fingers 
 Where the nails once broke Your skin 
 Did his faith finally begin? 
 I've lied if I've denied 
 The common ground I've shared with him 
 And I, I really want to know You 
 I want to make each day 
 A different way that I can show You how 
 I really want to love You 
 Be patient with my doubt 
 I'm just tryin' to figure out Your will 
 And I really want to know You still 
 Nicodemus could not understand 
 How You could Truly free us 
 He struggled with the image 
 Of a grown man born again 
 We might have been good friends 
 'Cause sometimes I still question, too 
 How easily we come to You 
 But I, I really want to know You 
 I want to make each day 
 A different way that I can show You how 
 I really want to love You 
 Be patient with my doubt 
 I'm just tryin' to figure out Your will 
 And I really want to know You still 
 No more camping on the porch of indecision 
 No more sleeping under stars of apathy 
 And it might be easier to dream 
 But dreaming's not for me 
 And I, I really want to know You 
 I want to make each day 
 A different way that I can show You how 
 I really want to love You 
 Be patient with my doubt 
 I'm just tryin' to figure out Your will 
 And I really want to know You still 
 I want to know you 
 I really want to know you 
 Hey yeah, yeah 
 I really want to know you 
 I really want to know you 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hello, Mr. Darkcloud 
 Never thought that we would meet so soon 
 Never thought I'd bundle up in June 
 Funny how the fog rolls 
 Funnier that I'd know who to blame 
 Never thought I'd have to own this pain 
 If all that's good and true 
 Comes from heaven 
 Then what's a girl to do 
 When it rains? 
 And I'm sayin' 
 Why, why, why, why? 
 I'm shakin' a fist in the dark, 
 And I'm askin' 
 Why, why, why, why? 
 Why does it keep getting harder 
 To say thanks? 
 Even fields of flowers 
 Dressing in their best because of You 
 Knowing they are blessed to be in bloom 
 But what about November 
 When the air is cold and wet winds blow 
 Do they understand why they can't grow? 
 And I could not pretend 
 To know the difference 
 Between the storms You send 
 And those I find 
 And I'm askin

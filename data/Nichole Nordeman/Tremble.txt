Have I come too casually? 
 Because it seems to me 
 There's something I've neglected 
 How does one approach a Deity 
 With informality 
 And still protect the Sacred? 
 'Cause you came and chose to wear the skin of all of us 
 And it's easy to forget You left a throne 
 And the line gets blurry all the time 
 Between daily and Divine 
 And it's hard to know the difference 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble 
 Face down on the ground do I dare 
 To take the liberty to stare at you 
 Oh, let me not, 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble 
 What a shame to think that I'd appear 
 Even slightly cavalier 
 In the matter of salvation 
 Do I claim this gift You freely gave 
 As if it were mine to take 
 With such little hesitation? 
 'Cause you came and stood among the very least of us 
 And it's easy to forget you left a throne 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble 
 Face down on the ground do I dare 
 To take the liberty to stare at you 
 Oh, let me not 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble 
 The cradle of the grave could not contain Your Divinity 
 Neither can I oversimplify this love 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble 
 Face down on the ground do I dare 
 To take the liberty to stare at you 
 Oh, let me 
 Oh, let me not forget to tremble

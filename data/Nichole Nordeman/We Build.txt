It's bigger than we thought 
 It's taller than it ought to be 
 This pile of rubble and ruins 
 The neighbors must talk 
 It's the worst yard on the block 
 Just branches and boards where walls stood 
 Did it seem to you 
 Like the storm just knew 
 We weren't quite finished with the roof 
 When it started? 
 So we build 
 We build 
 We clear away what was and make room for what will be 
 If you hold the nails, I'll take the hammer 
 I'll hold it still, if you'll climb the ladder 
 If you will, then I will, build 
 On any given day 
 We could simply walk away 
 And let someone else hold the pieces 
 The lie that we tell 
 Says its better somewhere else 
 As if love flies south when it freezes 
 What I'm trying to say 
 In some clumsy way 
 Is that it's you and only you for always 
 What I'm trying to say 
 In some clumsy way 
 Is that it's you and only you, not just for now, not just today 
 But it's you and only you for always

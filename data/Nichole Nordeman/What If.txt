What if you're right? 
 And He was just another nice guy 
 What if you're right? 
 What if it's true? 
 They say the cross 
 Will only make a fool of you 
 And what if it's true? 
 What if He takes His place in history 
 With all the prophets and the kings 
 Who taught us love and came in peace 
 But then the story ends 
 What then? 
 But what if you're wrong? 
 What if there's more? 
 What if there's hope 
 You never dreamed of hoping for? 
 What if you jump? 
 And just close your eyes? 
 What if the arms that catch you 
 Catch you by surprise? 
 What if He's more than enough? 
 What if it's love? 
 What if you dig 
 What if you dig 
 Way down deeper than 
 Your simple-minded friends 
 What if you dig? 
 What if you find 
 A thousand more 
 Unanswered questions down inside 
 That's all you find 
 What if you pick apart the logic 
 And begin to poke the holes 
 What if the crown of thorns is no more 
 Than folklore that must be told and retold 
 But what if you're wrong? 
 What if there's more? 
 What if there's hope 
 You never dreamed of hoping for? 
 What if you jump? 
 Just close your eyes? 
 What if the arms that catch you 
 Catch you by surprise? 
 What if He's more than enough? 
 What if it's love? 
 You've been running 
 As fast as you can 
 And you've been looking for a place 
 You can land so long 
 But what if you're wrong? 
 What if you jump? 
 And just close your eyes? 
 What if the arms that catch you 
 Catch you by surprise? 
 What if He's more than enough? 
 What if it's love?

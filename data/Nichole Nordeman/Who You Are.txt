I was certain that I knew You 
 At the tender age of twelve 
 You'd so often been described by those 
 Who said they knew You well 
 Dark and rugged in Your thirties 
 With a smile as bright as Your robe 
 Every teacher, every preacher 
 With the very best intent 
 Found new ways to hide the mystery 
 Replaced by common sense 
 And to know You was to keep You in my pocket 
 So easy to hold 
 I know I can't explain You 
 I would not even try to 
 And yet it's clear that You are here beside me 
 I marvel and I wonder 
 So near and somehow still so far 
 What makes You who You are? 
 It is easy to insist 
 On what is packaged and precise 
 And dismiss the clear suspicion 
 That You're bigger than we'd like 
 It is tempting to regard You as familiar 
 In so many ways 
 I've tried to draw these lines around You 
 A definition or an absolute 
 But I could not be satisfied with black or white 
 There is so much more 
 There is so much You

When I met him on a sidewalk 
 He was preaching to a mailbox 
 Down on 16th Avenue 
 And he told me he was Jesus 
 Sent from Jupiter to free us 
 With a bottle of tequila and one shoe 
 He raged about repentance 
 He finished every sentence 
 With a promise that the end was close at hand 
 I didn't even try to understand 
 He left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion 
 I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions 
 So I turned and walked away 
 And laughed at what he had to say 
 Then casually dismissed him as a fraud 
 I forgot he was created in the image of my God 
 When I met her in a bookstore 
 She was browsing on the first floor 
 Through a yoga magazine 
 And she told me in her past life 
 She was some plantation slave's wife 
 She had to figure out what that might mean 
 She believes the healing powers of her crystals 
 Can bring balance and new purpose to her life 
 Sounds nice 
 She left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion 
 I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions 
 So I turned and walked away 
 And laughed at what she had to say 
 Then casually dismissed her as a fraud 
 I forgot she was created in the image of my God 
 Not so long ago, a man from Galilee 
 Fed thousands with His bread and His theology 
 And the truth He spoke 
 Quickly became the joke 
 Of educated, self-inflated Pharisees like me 
 And they were wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion 
 They were tongue tied, drawn by their conclusions 
 Would I have turned and walked away 
 And laughed at what He had to say 
 And casually dismissed Him as a fraud 
 Unaware that I was staring at the image of my God

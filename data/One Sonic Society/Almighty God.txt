There is a river, there is a refuge 
 For all who come in need of help 
 There is a river 
 A holy place where the Most High dwells 
 Almighty God is our fortress 
 He is with us, God is with us 
 There is a river, that's overflowing 
 The presence of our Lord is here 
 There is a rive, join with us as we draw near 
 Almighty God is our fortress 
 He is with us, God is with us 
 Almighty God will not fail us 
 He is with us, God is with us 
 We will not fear 
 We will not fear 
 Though the earth give way 
 He is strong to save 
 We will not fear 
 We will not fear 
 Though the mountains shake 
 He is strong to save

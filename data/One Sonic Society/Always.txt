My foes are many, they rise against me 
 But I will hold my ground 
 I will not fear the war, I will not fear the storm 
 My help is on the way, my help is on the way 
 Oh, my God, He will not delay 
 My refuge and strength always 
 I will not fear, His promise is true 
 My God will come through, always, always 
 Trouble surrounds me, chaos abounding, 
 My soul will rest in You 
 I will not fear the war, I will not fear the storm 
 My help is on the way, my help is on the way 
 Oh, my God, He will not delay 
 My refuge and strength always 
 I will not fear, His promise is true 
 My God will come through, always, always 
 I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord 
 I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord 
 I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord 
 I lift my eyes up, my help comes from the Lord 
 From You Lord, from You Lord 
 Oh, my God, you will not delay 
 My refuge and strength always 
 I will not fear, His promise is true 
 My God will come through, always, always 
 Oh, my God, He will not delay 
 My refuge and strength, always, always

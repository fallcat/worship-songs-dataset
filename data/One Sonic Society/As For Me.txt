I have heard the call, and I will not be moved 
 I have set my heart, on one thing 
 I will wear your name for all the world to see 
 You lifted up 
 As for me I will raise your banner high 
 I will shout aloud your name I won't deny, 
 Jesus you have given all so I give you my life, 
 I will raise your banner high 
 When the cost is great, you are greater still 
 I am standing on this one thing 
 You will come again and all the world will you 
 You lifted up 
 I will sing, I will sing 
 God be praised, God be praised 
 All will see, all will see 
 God be praised, God be praised

Burn away my virtues 
 May there be just You and me 
 Lord write me into your great story 
 Lord write me into your great song 
 Take all I have 
 It's for Your glory 
 One day all else will be gone 
 One day all else will be gone 
 Give me grace to follow 
 Only You can lead me home 
 Lord write me into your great story 
 Lord write me into your great song 
 Take all I have 
 It's for Your glory 
 One day all else will be gone 
 One day all else will be gone 
 Your name be glorified, glorified Lord write me into your great story 
 Lord write me into your great song 
 Take all I have 
 It's for Your glory 
 One day all else will be gone 
 One day all else will be gone

The struggles that I face 
 The choices I have made 
 Can't stop Your love for me 
 Can't stop Your love 
 The darkness of the night 
 The scars I try to hide 
 Can't stop Your love for me 
 Can't stop Your love 
 Where can I go, where can I go 
 From Your presence? 
 In Your light I am known 
 I'm surrounded, I will not walk alone 
 Where can I go, where can I go 
 From Your presence? 
 In Your light I am known 
 I'm surrounded, I will not walk alone 
 Whatever lies ahead 
 You're with me ev'ry step 
 Can't stop Your love for me 
 Can't stop Your love 
 It's true with ev'ry breath 
 It's true that even death 
 Can't stop Your love for me 
 Can't stop Your love 
 Where can I go, where can I go 
 From Your presence? 
 In Your light I am known 
 I'm surrounded, I will not walk alone 
 Where can I go, where can I go 
 From Your presence? 
 In Your light I am known 
 I'm surrounded, I will not walk alone 
 Can't stop your love 
 Can't stop your love 
 No mountain is too high 
 No ocean is too wide 
 Can't stop Your love 
 No power is too great 
 You overcame the grave 
 Can't stop Your love 
 No mountain is too high 
 No ocean is too wide 
 Can't stop Your love 
 No power is too great 
 You overcame the grave 
 Can't stop Your love 
 Can't stop Your love 
 Where can I go, where can I go 
 From Your presence? 
 In Your light I am known 
 I'm surrounded, I will not walk alone 
 Where can I go, where can I go 
 From Your presence? 
 In Your light I am known 
 I'm surrounded, I will not walk alone 
 Can't stop Your love 
 Can't stop Your love 
 Can't stop Your love 
 Can't stop Your love

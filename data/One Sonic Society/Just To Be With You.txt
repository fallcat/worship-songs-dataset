Look my life is an empty coup 
 Kiss my heart would you fill me up 
 I'm fased to the ground 
 For sayking my price 
 Leave him I will 
 My burtons be hot 
 All I want, all I need is just to be with you 
 Just to be with you 
 Here I'am out your feet 
 Just to be with you, just to be with you 
 I have commed to the earth with me 
 And it's nothing a heart to break

 Into Your courts I will enter 
 Maker of heaven and earth 
 I tremble 
 In Your holy presence 
 Glory 
 Glory in Your sanctuary 
 Splendor and majesty Lord 
 Before You 
 All life adores You

 All the earth 
 Will declare 
 That Your love is everywhere 
 The fields will exalt 
 Seas resound 
 Hear the trees' 
 Joyful cry 
 Praising You and so will I 
 A new song I'll sing 
 Lord I will

Baring all I stand here before You 
 All my hurts exposed 
 In the depths of my despair I cry out to You 
 Make me whole 
 There is nothing I can do to make You love me more 
 Nothing I can do to make You love me less 
 I get on my knees and lift my hands to worship and confess 
 You are the Lord God Almighty 
 I fall at Your feet 
 And I fall oceans short of Your glory 
 Yet You stoop down to make me great 
 Almighty God 
 Everyday I choose again to love You 
 To keep Your word in my heart 
 Give it all to You now Lord, I will surrender 
 Take every part

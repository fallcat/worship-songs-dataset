Here I am, Oh God 
 I bring this sacrifice 
 My open heart, I offer up my life 
 I look to You, Lord 
 Your love that never ends 
 Restores me again 
 So I lift my eyes to you Lord 
 In your strength will I break through Lord 
 Touch me now, let your love fall down on me 
 I know your love dispels all my fears 
 Through the storm I will hold on Lord 
 And by faith I will walk on Lord 
 Then I'll see beyond my calvary one day 
 And I will be complete in You 
 Here I am, Oh God 
 I bring this sacrifice 
 My open heart, I offer up my life 
 I look to You, Lord 
 Your love that never ends 
 Restores me again 
 So I lift my eyes to you Lord 
 In your strength will I break through Lord 
 Touch me now, let your love fall down on me 
 I know your love dispels all my fears 
 Through the storm I will hold on Lord 
 And by faith I will walk on Lord 
 Then I'll see beyond my calvary one day 
 And I will be complete in You 
 I look to You, Lord 
 Your love that never ends 
 Restores me again 
 So I lift my eyes to you Lord 
 In your strength will I break through Lord 
 Touch me now, let your love fall down on me 
 I know your love dispels all my fears 
 Through the storm I will hold on Lord 
 And by faith I will walk on Lord 
 Then I'll see beyond my calvary one day 
 And I will be complete in 
 I will be complete in 
 I will be complete in You

Lord, lord let your kingdom come 
 Lord, lord let your will be done 
 In me, lord in me 
 Let the power of your holy ghost, be manifest in me 
 As you guide me living out your perfect will 
 So consume me, like fire, I open up my heart to you 
 Consume me, like fire, and leave no part of me untouched by you 
 Lord, reign in me perfectly 
 Lord, may I live constantly 
 In you 
 Lord in you 
 Let the power of your holy ghost 
 Be manifest in me 
 As you guide me living out your perfect will 
 So consume me, like fire, I open up my heart to you 
 Consume me, like fire, and leave no part of me untouched by you 
 I give you authority, my life, my heart I give to you 
 For you are my only hope, consume me with your holy fire 
 And cleanse me, overwhelm me, consecrate me, to you, only for you...

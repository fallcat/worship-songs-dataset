He is our God 
 Let all creation bow 
 The sovereign King most holy one 
 He sacrificed His life 
 Washed and cleansed within 
 Portioned by faith 
 We're destined to win 
 Everything that has breath 
 Praise the Lord 
 Everything that's in me 
 Praise the Lord 
 I can praise Him 
 On the highest mountain 
 Praise Him in the lowest valley 
 Everything that's in me 
 Praise the Lord

Lord I come into your Holy place. 
 Stand in awe, of your cleansing grace. 
 Who am I, that you would care for me? 
 I glorified the one who died for me. 
 Glorify, glorify 
 Let your name be lifted up and glorified 
 Let the earth tremble at your name 
 Let your name be lifted up and glorified 
 Into your hands, I commit my life 
 Day by day as a living sacrifice 
 Who am I that you would care for me? 
 I glorify the one who died for me

Jesus is real 
 The love I feel 
 Jesus is real 
 The love I feel 
 When you walk through the valley of shadows 
 When you walk through the valley of fear 
 When you feel like you can't go on 
 The Lord is right there 
 When you feel like there's no tomorrow 
 When you feel like you can't go on 
 When you feel like you're all alone 
 The Lord is right there 
 Call out his name 
 Praise Jesus' name

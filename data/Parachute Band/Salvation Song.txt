Jesus I come to You 
 In my heart I bow my knee 
 Jesus, please take my heart 
 In it make Your home in me 
 I believe, Jesus You are God 
 And You died for me 
 I believe, Lord You rose again 
 From my sin You set me free to live again 
 I turn away from my sin Lord 
 And turn to You, to You 
 I thank You for saving me Lord 
 Lord have Your way in me 
 By Your spirit draw me near 
 I have the faith to see 
 Jesus You can save me here 
 Surely Your mercy has saved me, delivered me 
 You gave Your life now I'm Yours 
 Evermore ... take me

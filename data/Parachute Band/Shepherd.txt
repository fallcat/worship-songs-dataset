Lord, when I hear Your call 
 Deep within my spirit cries 
 Yes I will follow 
 Lord, when I start to walk 
 Through that narrow gate I cry 
 Yes I will follow 
 And in the valley of shadows 
 No evil will I fear 
 You are the Shepherd of my heart 
 I will trust You 
 And I go wherever You lead me 
 Safe in Your arms I'll be alright 
 How I love You 
 And I go wherever You lead me, lead me 
 The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want 
 He maketh me lie down in pastures green

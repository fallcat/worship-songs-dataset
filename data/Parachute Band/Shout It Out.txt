This is the time 
 This is the place 
 With outstretched arms 
 We seek Your face 
 We surrender all to You 
 Surrender all to You 
 Shout it out x2 
 We'll lift Your name 
 Shout it out 
 Your love it still remains the same 
 We're singing 
 Let it out x2 
 We'll sing Your praise 
 Let it out x2 
 'Cause we can't contain the way we feel about You 
 We once were lost 
 And out of place 
 By Your blood our sins erased 
 Surrender all to You 
 Surrender all to You 
 Glory to the Lord on high 
 Forever King of mine

You are the sovereign one 
 Jesus second to none 
 Almighty Saviour, devil is defeated 
 You are my sole defender 
 My only spirit mender 
 You are my hero, thank you Jesus 
 There's power in the name of Jesus, Jesus 
 You give deliverance that frees us, frees us 
 Though Satan tries to overcome, defeat us 
 I call upon the mighty name of Jesus 
 Jesus, I call upon Your name 
 You are the strength inside me 
 Up, down, around, beside me 
 When I am weak, I'm strong 
 By the power of the risen Lord within me 
 Power, Jesus, power, in the name of Jesus

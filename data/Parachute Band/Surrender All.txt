God of Mercy, 
 Show your mighty hand. 
 God of wonder, 
 Breathe on us again. 
 You're my King and all-consuming fire 
 Heaven shakes, your might tears up the sky 
 Surrender all, surrender all 
 I'm dead to sin, alive within 
 Surrender all, Surrender all 
 God almighty, 
 Change my dark to night 
 God of passion, 
 Gave your blood as life.

All my life I'll praise You 
 There's no other like You 
 You alone are Lord 
 Lord Jesus 
 Who controls the rushing of the mighty wind 
 Who holds the power of the seas 
 Who by His word formed 
 The heavens and the earth almighty God 
 Almighty God 
 The Lord Jesus is His name 
 He is the one who holds the universe 
 The power of life is in His hands 
 His strength is in me 
 Helping me to do his will 
 He is my Lord 
 In His power I will stand

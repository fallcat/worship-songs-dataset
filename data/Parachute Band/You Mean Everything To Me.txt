You mean everything to me 
 Lord You are so faithful 
 Where I wanna be 
 Is in Your presence 
 That's where I belong 
 When Your spirit's falling on me 
 That's where I feel strong 
 When Your grace is upon me 
 You've given me a song 
 And now I'm going to worship 
 In Your presence 
 I only want to live for you 
 Giving You glory 
 In all that I do

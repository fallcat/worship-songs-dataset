Your Word I can't deny Your truth 
 It covers me and lights the way ahead 
 Your ways of mercy never end 
 My life surrounded by the hope within 
 You've placed a fire within my heart 
 Awakening desire for You 
 Forever Lord will Your Word remain 
 We sing glory to Your name 
 Glory to Your name 
 Forever King of eternal fame 
 So we sing glory to Your name 
 Glory to Your name 
 I stand upon the things You said 
 My trust in You and by Your Word I live 
 I know that You have rescued me 
 My way is set Your light will lead me on 
 Follow follow follow follow You

A fresh start, bitter to it's core. 
 An ailing heart, to fix itself once more. 
 We set out to change this world but we could only change our minds. 
 This became about us that night. 
 You can only push a dead dream so far. 
 Lucky Four's, unlucky five. 
 Home is where Hendershot is so we'll survive. 
 We'll burn that midnight oil one last time. 
 Our lives may appear rich but we are just as broke. 
 We can't afford to do this shit anymore but I can't afford to let it go. 
 If all good thing's must come to an end than we were done before we ever started 
 And I don't know if I will ever feel as alive as I did with the four of you by my side

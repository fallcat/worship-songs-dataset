This song deals with the power of imagination, to transform 
 And transcend the circumstances of our lives, 
 To be better than people would have us be. 
 "Not to see life as it is but as it ought to be" 
 Dream the impossible dream. 
 Fight the impossible fight. 
 Love the impossible love. 
 Stand up straight. 
 Look them dead in the eye. 
 Scream at the top of your lungs. 
 They may think your'e crazy, and you may lose the war, 
 But remember that it is better to have loved then to have never loved at all. 
 Nothing is better left unsaid. 
 Never forget your lines.

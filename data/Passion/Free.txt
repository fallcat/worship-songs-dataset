Free like the river 
 Flowin' freely through infinity 
 Free to be sure of 
 What I am and who I need not be 
 Free from all worries 
 Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind 
 Freer than the clock's hands 
 Tickin' way the times 
 Freer than the meaning of free that man defines 
 Life running through me 
 Till I feel my father God has called 
 Me having nothin' 
 But possessing riches more than all 
 And I'm free 
 To be nowhere 
 But in every place I need to be 
 Freer than a sunbeam 
 Shinning through my soul 
 Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold 
 Free from conceiving the beginning 
 For that's the infinite start 
 I'm gone - gone but still living 
 Life goes on without a beating heart 
 Free like a vision 
 That the mind of only you can see 
 Freer than a raindrop 
 Falling from the sky 
 Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes 
 I'm free like a river 
 Flowin' freely to infinity 
 I'm free to be sure of what 
 I am and who I need not be 
 I'm much freer - like the meaning of the word free that 
 Crazy man defines 
 Free - free like the vision that 
 The mind of only you are ever gonna see 
 Free like the river my life 
 Goes on and on through infinity

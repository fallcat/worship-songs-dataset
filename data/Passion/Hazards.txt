I am running on empty. 
 The fumes have long since disappeared. 
 I am feeling bone dry. 
 The gauge reads empty and that's how I feel. 
 What more do I have left to give? 
 What good is my advice if I don't want to live? 
 What's done is done and I'm breaking down on the side of the road. 
 What's done is done and I've broken down and I have never felt more alone. 
 I can't seem to see what lies ahead. 
 These city lights are blinding. 
 I have to find my own way. 
 I don't want to be like this. 
 I wouldn't wish this on anyone. 
 I left because I didn't want you to see me like this. 
 I can only be myself when I am by myself. 
 What is left but to start all over? 
 I swear I'll make it right this time. 
 This town has nothing left for me. 
 I'm moving on to god know's what. 
 I have to believe that there is something better out there. 
 I have to believe that I can make it anywhere. 
 I swear upon this cast that I will not break myself again. 
 I have hurt for long enough. 
 I need air for these collapsed lungs. 
 I can barely stand but I will find the strength within to start again. 
 Will you take my hand? 
 A new city, a new night, will bring this corpse back to life

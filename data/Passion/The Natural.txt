A moment of weakness. 
 A lapse in judgement. 
 A fear of failure. 
 Fear not your peers. 
 Where do we go from here? 
 Why would we want to leave? 
 Why should we stay? 
 Fear not the possibilities. 
 Surrounded. Enclosed. Lost. 
 In a room full of hundreds and yet we still feel alone. 
 No one ever listens. 
 But we decide where we go from here. 
 We will paint the perfect picture. 
 How much longer can we put off our childhood dreams for this adulthood fantasy? 
 They will all talk, talk, talk, because that is all they have ever been. 
 But we know better. 
 You are in a crowd, step away from it. 
 I will put it all on the line, if you do. 
 Don't be afraid to walk away. 
 The walls are sound proof they can't hear us. 
 It's just us now. 
 I can't do this without you. 
 But I know this won't last forever. 
 I don't want to lose you, but how can I ask you to stay? 
 I know this won't go anywhere, but it's all I have. 
 Promise me, we will try. Promise me, that we will atleast try. 
 That is all I ask. 
 Try. Believe. Leave. 
 Close your eyes and the world disappears. 
 Open your eyes and I will be right here. 
 If this is the end, so be it. 
 This is a blank canvas. 
 I just don't know where to begin. 
 I am back where I started. Here we go again

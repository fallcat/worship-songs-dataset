It's over. 
 I feel a calm wash over me as I lie here silently. 
 Imposters pay their respects while they deal with their regrets. 
 Forget this, it's too late. 
 Could they have done more to prevent this? 
 Should I have done less? I deserve better than this. 
 It isn't their fault. I never let them in. 
 Looking down upon me while I look down on all of you. 
 I gave you all I had. I had nothing left to give. 
 From ear to ear, show the world your fear. 
 Cover it up with a smile, it'll only hurt for a little while. 
 This was never about me, admit it. 
 Were we really that close? 
 I gave and I gave, I gave until there was nothing left. 
 I had nothing left for all of you. 
 Do not remember me this way. I deserve better than that. 
 I am now nothing more than a memory. 
 You won't notice I'm gone. 
 You won't remember my name. 
 This was never about me. 
 Disappear. 
 When my will is read aloud it will read that I gave my all. 
 Let that light in. 
 Let that light shine. 
 Let that light burn. 
 Let that light die. 
 Disappear

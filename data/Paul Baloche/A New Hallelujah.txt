Can you hear? 
 There's a new song breaking out 
 From the children of freedom 
 Every race and every nation 
 Sing it out, sing a new hallelujah 
 Let us sing 
 Love to the nations bringing hope 
 Of the grace that has freed us 
 Make Him known and make Him famous 
 Sing it out, sing a new hallelujah 
 Arise, let the church arise 
 Let love reach to the other side 
 Alive, come alive 
 Let the song arise 
 All the world sings a new song 
 Reaching out with a new hallelujah 
 Every son and every daughter 
 Everyone sing a new hallelujah 
 Let the song arise 
 Let the song arise 
 Let the song arise

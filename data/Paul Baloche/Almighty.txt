One day, sovereign and Almighty 
 You will show Your power 
 And forever reign 
 On that day every earthly ruler 
 Will bow their knee before You 
 And revere Your name 
 Holy holy, Lord Almighty 
 Lord we long for Your return 
 One day 
 We will fall before You 
 Bow in adoration 
 Hearing angels sing 
 On that day 
 We will join their chorus 
 Overcome with wonder 
 Lifting up our King 
 In the twinkling of an eye 
 We will be changed 
 We will meet You in the sky Almighty 
 All the heavens and the earth 
 Will sing Your praise 
 And Your people will rejoice Almighty 
 Almighty 
 One day, you will judge the nations 
 You'll reward Your servants 
 Both the great and small 
 On that day 
 Those who rose against You 
 Finally confess You 
 As the Lord of all

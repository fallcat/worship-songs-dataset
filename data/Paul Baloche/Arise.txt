One thing we ask of You 
 One thing that we desire 
 And as we worship You 
 Lord, come and change our lives 
 Arise, arise, arise, arise 
 Arise, take Your place 
 Be enthroned on our praise 
 Arise, King of Kings 
 Holy God, as we sing 
 Arise, arise 
 One thing we ask of You 
 One thing that we desire 
 And as we worship You 
 Lord, come and change our lives 
 Arise, arise, arise, arise 
 Arise, take Your place 
 Be enthroned on our praise 
 Arise, King of Kings 
 Holy God, as we sing 
 Arise, Lord, arise 
 Lord, one thing we ask of You tonight 
 One thing that we desire 
 That as we worship You 
 Would You come, Holy spirit 
 And change our lives? 
 Arise, arise, arise, arise 
 Arise, arise, arise, arise 
 Arise, take Your place 
 Be enthroned on our praise 
 Arise, King of Kings 
 Holy God, as we sing 
 Arise, take Your place 
 Be enthroned on our praise 
 Arise, King of Kings 
 Holy God, as we sing 
 Arise, Lord arise 
 Take Your place, take Your place 
 This place 
 Arise, holy God, arise 
 Lord, come, take Your place 
 Be enthroned on our praises, Lord

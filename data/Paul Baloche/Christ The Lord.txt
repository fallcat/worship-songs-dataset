Son of God proved His love 
 That while we were sinners Jesus died for us 
 No more shame, no more fear 
 Christ the Lord is risen today 
 The lamb of God has taken our sins away 
 Love's redeeming work is done 
 Raise Your voice, the King has overcome 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 By His grace, long ago 
 Our sins were as scarlet, now they're white as snow 
 Love was nailed to the cross 
 His dying and His rising has changed our hearts 
 Made like Him, like Him we'll rise 
 Ours the cross, the grave, the sky

Look inside the mystery 
 See the empty cross 
 See the risen Savior 
 Victorious and strong 
 No one else above Him 
 None as strong to save 
 He alone has conquered 
 The power of the grave 
 Glorious my eyes have seen 
 The glory of the Lord 
 Glorious He stands above 
 The rulers of the earth 
 Look beyond the tombstone 
 See the living God 
 See the resurrected 
 Ruler of my heart 
 No one else above Him 
 None to match His worth 
 The hope of His returning 
 Fills the universe 
 Glorious glorious 
 Lord, You are glorious 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 You are glorious 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 You are glorious

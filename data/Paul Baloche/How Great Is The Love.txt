Thank You for the way 
 That You love us 
 How You love us 
 Thank You for the way 
 You have made us 
 We were created 
 For Your pleasure 
 For Your presence 
 For the glory of Your name 
 Thank You for the way 
 That You love us 
 Jesus, faithful King 
 Lord with grateful hearts we sing 
 How great is the love 
 How great is the love 
 Of our Savior 
 The weight of the cross 
 The curse of our shame 
 You carried it all 
 And rose from the grave 
 Thank You for the grace 
 That has saved us 
 You forgave us 
 Thank You for the way 
 You have freed us 
 We have been ransomed 
 We've been rescued 
 We've been purchased 
 With the price of Your own life 
 Thank You for the way 
 That You love us

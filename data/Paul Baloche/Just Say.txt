I will lay me down here at Your feet 
 Save me from myself, calm the raging seas 
 You will be my ark that floats me 
 Up above the storm 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Hear my humble prayer, help my unbelief 
 Speak to me Your hope, Jesus, carry me 
 You will be my ark that floats me 
 Up above the storm 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Your goodness, Your mercy will rescue me 
 Let Your power, Your blood wash over me 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 Just say, just say the word 
 Just say the word, I'll be made whole 
 I'll be made whole

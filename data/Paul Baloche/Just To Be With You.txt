Lord my life is an empty cup 
 Here's my heart 
 Would You fill me up? 
 I'm face to the ground 
 Forsaking my pride 
 Leaving my will 
 My burdens behind 
 All I want, all I need 
 Is just to be with You 
 Just to be with You 
 Here I am, at Your feet 
 Just to be with You 
 Just to be with You 
 I have come to the end of me 
 And there's nothing 
 I have to bring 
 But You said I belong 
 You say I am Yours 
 Nothing compares 
 To knowing You more 
 You made a way for me, oh Savior 
 I'm Yours forevermore 
 You made a way for me, oh Savior 
 I'm Yours forevermore 
 I'm Yours forevermore 
 All I want 
 Just to be with You

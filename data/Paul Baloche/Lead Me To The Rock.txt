When my heart is overwhelmed 
 And my eyes are blind to You 
 And the pain of life is just too heavy to bear 
 And then the mountains seems so high 
 And my faith's too weak to climb 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I 
 When my life is hit with fear 
 And I fight to hide the tears 
 And I wrestle in my heart to know what to do 
 Lord, I'm welling up inside 
 But I know You hear my cry 
 Jesus, lead me to the rock that is higher than I 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I 
 You are the rock and there is no other 
 A tower of strength, You are my shelter 
 Lord, You are my hope eternal 
 You are the rock that is higher than I 
 You are the rock and there is no other, oh 
 A tower of strength, You are my shelter 
 Lord, You are my hope eternal 
 You are the rock that is higher than I 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, oh 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, oh 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, oh 
 Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock 
 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, oh

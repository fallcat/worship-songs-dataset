Look upon the Lord 
 Standing up of His beauty 
 Look upon the Lord 
 See the heart He is holding 
 Let the glory of our God 
 From heaven come down 
 Let the house of the Lord 
 Be filled with the cloud 
 You are good 
 And Your mercy will endure 
 You are good 
 And forever we are Yours 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Listen for the Lord 
 Hear the voice of His spirit 
 Call upon His name 
 He is near, He is with us 
 Let the glory of our God 
 From heaven come down 
 Let the house of the Lord 
 Be filled with the cloud 
 You are good 
 And Your mercy will endure 
 You are good 
 And forever we are Yours 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Holy, holy, with one voice 
 Heaven and earth are singing 
 Holy, holy, holy, with one voice 
 Heaven and earth are singing 
 Holy, holy, with one voice 
 Heaven and earth are singing 
 Holy, holy, holy, with one voice 
 Heaven and earth are singing 
 You are good 
 And Your mercy will endure 
 You are good 
 And forever we are Yours 
 You are good 
 And Your mercy will endure 
 You are good 
 And forever we are Yours 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah

River flow from Your throne 
 From Your heart through my soul 
 Healing flood, God of peace 
 Speak Your word and quiet me 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 Mercy way down on me 
 Hide me now beneath Your wings 
 Hold me close to your side 
 I am Yours, You are mine 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 Open up wide, go under my eyes 
 Take all I have and make it Yours 
 You've given Your life and now I'm alive 
 To worship You now, forever more 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 I was made to be loved by You 
 To be loved by You, to be loved by You, Jesus 
 Jesus, mmm

I'm here to meet with you 
 Come and meet with me 
 I'm here to find you 
 Reveal yourself to me 
 As I wait, you make me strong 
 As I long, draw me to your arms 
 As I stand and sing your praise 
 You come, you come and you fill this place 
 Won't you come, Won't you come and fill this place 
 I'm here to meet with you 
 Come and meet with me 
 I'm here to find you, 
 Reveal yourself to me 
 As I wait, you make me strong 
 As I long, draw me to your arms 
 As I stand and sing your praise 
 You come, you come and you fill this place 
 Won't you come, Won't you come and fill this place 
 I'm here to meet with you 
 Come and meet with me

Nothin' will change if all the plans I make are wrong 
 Your love stays the same 
 Your light will guide me through it all 
 I'm hangin' on, I'm leanin' in to You 
 Nothin' can reach the end of all Your faithfulness 
 Your grace is with me 
 Through every shadow, every test 
 I'm hangin' on, I'm leanin' in to You 
 I don't know where You'll take me 
 But I know You're always good 
 My hope is built on nothin' else 
 Than Your great love, Your righteousness 
 I will not walk another way 
 I trust Your heart, I trust Your name 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 You are my rock when storms are ragin' all along 
 You shelter me, God 
 I'm safe with you on solid ground 
 I'm hangin' on, I'm leanin' in to You 
 I don't know where You'll take me 
 But I know You're always good 
 My hope is built on nothin' else 
 Than Your great love, Your righteousness 
 I will not walk another way 
 I trust Your heart, I trust Your name 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 My hope is built on nothin' else 
 Than Your great love, Your righteousness 
 I will not walk another way 
 I trust Your heart, I trust Your name 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on, to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on to You 
 I'm holdin' on to You 
 (Holdin' on to You) 
 My hope is built on nothin' else 
 Than Your great love, Your righteousness 
 I will not walk another way 
 I trust Your heart, I trust Your name

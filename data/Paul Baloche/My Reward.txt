I wanna hear You say the words to me, ?Well done? 
 I wanna hear You say, ?Good and faithful servant? 
 I wanna hear You say, ?I've prepared a place for you? 
 Let all the treasures of this world fade away 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To hear Your voice on that day is all I'm living for 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To see Your face on that day is all I'm living for 
 I wanna hear You say the words to me, ?Well done? 
 I wanna hear You say, ?Good and faithful servant? 
 I wanna hear You say, ?I've prepared a place for you? 
 Lord, let all the treasures of this world fade away 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To hear Your voice on that day is all I'm living for 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To see Your face on that day is all I'm living for 
 In the twinkling of an eye, we'll all be changed 
 We'll meet You in the sky, we will see You face to face 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To hear Your voice on that day is all I'm living for, all I'm living for 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To see Your face on that day is all I'm living for 
 Jesus, all I'm living for 
 Jesus, all I'm living for 
 Jesus, all I'm living for 
 To see Your face on that day 
 To hear Your voice on that day 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To hear Your voice on that day is all I'm living for 
 Jesus, You are my reward 
 To see Your face on that day is all I'm living for

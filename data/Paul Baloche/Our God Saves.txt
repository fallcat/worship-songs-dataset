In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son 
 In the name of the Spirit, Lord, we come 
 We're gathered together to lift up Your Name 
 To call on our Savior to fall on Your grace 
 In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son 
 In the name of the Spirit, Lord, we come 
 We're gathered together to lift up Your Name 
 To call on our Savior to fall on Your grace 
 To call on our Savior, to fall on Your grace 
 Hear the joyful sound of our offering 
 As Your saints bow down, as Your people sing 
 We will rise with You, lifted on Your wings 
 And the world will see that 
 Our God saves, our God saves 
 There is hope in Your name 
 Our God saves, our God saves 
 There is hope in Your name 
 Mourning turns to songs of praise 
 Our God saves, our God saves

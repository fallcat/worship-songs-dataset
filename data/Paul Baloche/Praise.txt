There's a song creation's singing 
 And it sounds throughout the universe 
 It's our longing for You, Jesus 
 It's an anthem telling of Your worth 
 Praise, when the sun is rising 
 Praise, when the day is fading 
 Praise, when the stars are shining 
 O God, we wait, we wait on You 
 God, our hearts are yearning for You 
 Like the watchmen waiting for the dawn 
 And our eyes are turned towards You 
 For the day when You return 
 Until that day we'll sing 
 God, our hearts are yearning for You 
 Like the watchmen waiting for the dawn 
 And our eyes are turned towards You 
 For the day when You return 
 Until that day we'll sing

With groaning, too deep the words 
 I am for You, I yearn for You 
 With all of my weakness I come 
 In need of You, in need of You 
 Savior, save me, Healer, heal me 
 Jesus, have Your way 
 King of glory, reign in me 
 Reign in me 
 I surrender to You alone 
 Your will be done, Your will be done 
 With all of my heart I restart 
 My life to You, it's all for You 
 Savior, save me, Healer, heal me 
 Jesus, have Your way 
 King of glory, reign in me 
 Reign in me 
 Savior, save me 
 (Savior, save me) 
 Healer, heal me 
 (Healer, heal me) 
 Jesus, have Your way 
 King of glory, reign in me 
 Reign in me 
 Forever I will say 
 You are good and Your promises 
 Will never fade away 
 Never fade away 
 Your pouring out Your strength 
 And Your joy is forever lasting 
 I will never be the same 
 I will never be the same 
 Savior, save me 
 (Savior, save me) 
 Healer, heal me 
 (Healer, heal me) 
 Jesus, have Your way 
 King of glory, reign in me 
 Reign in me 
 Savior, save me 
 (Savior, save me) 
 Healer, heal me 
 (Healer, heal me) 
 Jesus, have Your way 
 King of glory, reign in me 
 Reign in me 
 Reign in me, reign in me 
 Reign in me, reign in me

There is no rock 
 There is no god like our God 
 No other name worthy of all our praise 
 The Rock of Salvation that cannot be moved 
 He's proven Himself to be faithful and true 
 There is no rock 
 There is no god like ours 
 Rock of Ages 
 Jesus is the Rock 
 Rock of Ages 
 Jesus is the Rock 
 Rock of Ages 
 Jesus is the Rock 
 There is no rock 
 There is no god like ours 
 Rock of Ages 
 Jesus You're the Rock 
 There is no rock 
 There is no god like ours 
 Rock of Ages

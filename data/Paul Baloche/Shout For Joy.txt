Pour out your fervent prays 
 There's a song to raise like a banner high 
 Lift up your grateful heart to the morning star 
 He's alive and here with us 
 Shout for joy, for the Son of God 
 Is the saving one, He's the saving one 
 Shout for joy, see what love has done 
 He has come for us, He's the saving one 
 We stood on sinking sand 
 He reached out His hand, brought us to His side 
 We turned our hearts away, He was strong to save 
 Now our Savior reigns in us 
 Shout for joy, for the Son of God 
 Is the saving one, He's the saving one 
 Shout for joy, see what love has done 
 He has come for us, He's the saving one 
 Jesus, You have saved us, be glorified 
 Jesus, You have saved us, be glorified 
 Jesus, You have saved us, be glorified 
 Shout for joy, for the Son of God 
 Is the saving one, He's the saving one 
 Shout for joy, see what love has done 
 He has come for us, He's the saving one 
 Shout for joy, for the Son of God 
 Is the saving one, He's the saving one 
 Shout for joy, see what love has done 
 He has come for us, He's the saving one

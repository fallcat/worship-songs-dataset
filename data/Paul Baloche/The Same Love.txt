You choose the humble and raise them high 
 You choose the weak and make them strong 
 You heal our brokenness inside and give us life 
 The same love that set the captives free 
 The same love that opened eyes to see 
 Is calling us all by name 
 You are calling us all by name 
 The same God that spread the heavens wide 
 The same God that was crucified 
 Is calling us all by name 
 You are calling us all by name 
 You take the faithless one aside 
 And speak the words "You are mine" 
 You call the cynic and the proud 
 Come to me now 
 The same love that set the captives free 
 The same love that opened eyes to see 
 Is calling us all by name 
 You are calling us all by name 
 The same God that spread the heavens wide 
 The same God that was crucified 
 Is calling us all by name 
 You are calling us all by name 
 Oh, oh, You're calling, You're calling 
 You're calling us to the cross 
 You're calling, You're calling 
 You're calling us to the cross 
 You're calling, You're calling 
 You're calling us to the cross 
 You're calling, You're calling 
 You're calling us to the cross 
 The same love that set the captives free 
 The same love that opened eyes to see 
 Is calling us all by name 
 You are calling us all by name 
 The same God that spread the heavens wide 
 The same God that was crucified 
 Is calling us all by name 
 You are calling us all by name 
 You're calling, You're calling 
 You're calling us to the cross 
 You're calling, You're calling 
 You're calling us to the cross

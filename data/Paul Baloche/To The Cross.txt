Where can I go 
 But to the cross to the cross 
 For there my shame 
 You have washed away 
 Where can I go 
 But to the cross to the cross 
 For there You gave 
 Up Your life for me 
 You gave Your life for me 
 You stretched Your arms out wide 
 I lift my hands up high to my Savior 
 You stretched Your arms out wide 
 I lift my hands up high to my Savior 
 So Lord I run 
 To the cross to the cross 
 Surrender all to my Savior King 
 Be my everything 
 Chains are broken 
 Shame has fallen 
 All my sins are gone

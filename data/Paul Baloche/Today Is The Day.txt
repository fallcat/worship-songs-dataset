I'm casting my cares aside 
 I'm leaving my past behind 
 I'm setting my heart and mind on You Jesus 
 I'm reaching my hands to Yours 
 Believing there's so much more 
 Knowing that all You have in store for me is good, is good 
 Today is the day 
 You have made 
 I will rejoice 
 And be glad in it 
 And I won't worry about tomorrow, 
 I'm trusting in what You say! 
 Today is the day! 
 Today is the day! 
 I'm putting my fears aside 
 I'm leaving my doubts behind 
 I'm giving my hopes and dreams to You, Jesus 
 Today is the day 
 You have made 
 I will rejoice 
 And be glad in it 
 And I won't worry about tomorrow, 
 I'm trusting in what You say! 
 Today is the day! 
 I will stand upon Your truth 
 All my days, I'll live for You 
 I will stand upon Your truth 
 All my days I'll live for You 
 Today is the day 
 You have made 
 I will rejoice 
 And be glad in it 
 I won't worry 'bout tomorrow 
 Giving You my fears and sorrows 
 Where You lead me, I will follow 
 I'm trusting in what You say 
 Today is the day!

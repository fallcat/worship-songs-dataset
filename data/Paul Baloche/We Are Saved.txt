Who compares to You? 
 The son of God with open arms 
 Crucified for us 
 You gave it all to win our hearts 
 We stand amazed at the work the cross 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 Our sin has been forgiven, You've broken every chain 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 From the grave you lost 
 You turn our shame into Your breasts 
 You stand by grace alone 
 You have made a way when there was no way 
 We stand amazed at the work the cross 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 Our sin has been forgiven, You've broken every chain 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 For we on it, forever, Jesus be lifted higher 
 We owe it all to You 
 For we on it, forever, Jesus be lifted higher 
 We owe it all to You 
 We stand amazed at the work the cross 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 Our sin has been forgiven, You've broken every chain 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 We stand amazed at the work the cross 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 Our sin has been forgiven, You've broken every chain 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 We are saved, we are saved 
 We stand amazed 
 Mmm, we stand amazed

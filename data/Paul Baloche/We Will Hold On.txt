We'll be tested by the fire 
 Persecuted and reviled maybe 
 Either way there will be trials 
 We will hold on 
 We'll be tested by the blessing 
 With all the comforts 
 Of the world surrounding 
 We will not forget the Savior 
 We will hold on 
 We will hold on to Your love 
 We will hold on to Your love 
 When the world is silent 
 Your praise unsung 
 We will hold on to Your love 
 When the battle rages on 
 When we fail to overcome 
 In our weakness Jesus 
 You make us strong 
 We will hold on to Your love 
 We will hold on to Your love 
 We will hold on, we will hold on 
 We will hold on, we will hold on

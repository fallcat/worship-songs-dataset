When I see the beauty of a sunset's glory, 
 Amazing artistry across the evening sky. 
 When I feel the mystery of a distant galaxy, 
 It awes and humbles me to be loved, by a God so high. 
 What can I do but thank You, 
 What can I do but give my life to You 
 Halle- lu- jah, hallelujah 
 What can I do but praise You, 
 Everyday make everything I do a hallelu - jah 
 A hallelujah, hallelu - jah 
 When I hear the story of a God of mercy 
 Who shared humanity and suffered by our side 
 Of the cross they nailed You to, that could not hold You 
 Now You're making all things new by the power of Your risen life

Amazed and overwhelmed 
 At how Your mercy fell 
 And changed a heart as hard as mine 
 I tried to turn away 
 Deny the hand You gave 
 But You refused to leave my side 
 Wonderful God 
 Wonderful God 
 Wonderful Savior 
 Wonderful love 
 Who could compare 
 None can be found 
 Wonderful Savior 
 Wonderful God 
 Undeserving grace 
 Stole my heart away 
 Forever I am Yours my King 
 The beauty of Your strength 
 Draws me once again 
 To stand before You now and sing 
 You said You'd never leave me 
 And You never did 
 You say I have a future 
 And there's a life for me to live 
 Lord I wannna praise You 
 And say 
 Wonderful God 
 Wonderful God 
 Wonderful Savior 
 Wonderful God

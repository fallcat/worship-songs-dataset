You have shown us, oh God, what is good 
 You have shown us, oh Lord, what You require 
 You have heard all our songs 
 How we long to worship You 
 Yeah, You've told us the offering You desire 
 To do justice and to love mercy 
 And to walk humbly with You, God 
 You said, to do justice and to love mercy 
 And to walk humbly with You, God 
 You have shown us the riches of Your love 
 And You have shown us Your heart for those in need 
 Lord, You're opening our ears to the cries of the poor 
 You have called us to be Your hand and feet 
 To do justice and to love mercy 
 And to walk humbly with You, God 
 You said, to do justice and to love mercy 
 And to walk humbly with You, God 
 To the oppressed and the broken 
 To the widow and the orphan 
 Let the river of Your justice flow through us 
 To the oppressed and the broken 
 To the widow and the orphan 
 Let the river of Your justice flow through us 
 Let Your river flow, let Your river flow 
 Let the river of Your justice flow through us, oh 
 To do justice and to love mercy 
 And to walk humbly with You, God 
 You said, to do justice and to love mercy 
 And to walk humbly with You, God 
 To do justice and to love mercy 
 And to walk humbly with You, God

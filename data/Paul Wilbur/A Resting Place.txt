My soul finds rest in God alone 
 My peace depends on Him 
 In that place of quiet rest 
 He fills me from within 
 He pours on me His holy oil 
 The Spirit of the Living God 
 And comforts me with Hs love 
 Comfort me with Your love 
 Those who wait upon the Lord 
 New strength He gives them 
 He gives them wings like the eagle 
 That they might soar with Him 
 He weaves His strength into their lives 
 The Spirit of Adonai 
 Then He gives then all of His peace 
 To guard their hearts and their minds 
 Guarding our hearts and minds 
 So come my soul now take your rest 
 Find your peace in Him 
 The Holy presence of the Lord 
 That fills you from within 
 O pour on me Your holy oil 
 The Spirit of the Living God 
 Fill my cup Lord I lift it up 
 Until I overflow

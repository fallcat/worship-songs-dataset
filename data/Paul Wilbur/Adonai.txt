Lord of eternity 
 The mystery behind the veil 
 Lord over Heaven and earth 
 God of Israel 
 Come with Your wisdom and power 
 Clothed in Your honor and strength 
 Lord hear the cry of our hearts 
 Come O conquering King 
 And every eye will see 
 Your glory fill the sky 
 Adonai Adonai 
 Every knee will to You Lord Most High 
 Adonai Adonai 
 You alone are God every tongue will cry 
 Adonai 
 Here Jerusalem waits 
 Praises lifted on high 
 Here the beautiful gates 
 Long to see You arise 
 When all of Zion sings 
 Baruch ha ba b'shem 
 You are the Lord over all the earth 
 You are the Lord over all the earth

O Lord many are my foes 
 O Lord many rise against me 
 They say where is your God 
 They say God will not deliver you 
 Now arise O Lord deliver me from my foes 
 As You struck down Your enemies in days of long ago 
 Now arise O Lord deliver me from the dead 
 You have become my glory 
 You're the lifter of my head 
 O Lord I lie down to sleep 
 The foe comes against me on every side 
 But I, will have no fear 
 For You, You sustain me with Your right hand 
 You have become my glory 
 You're the lifter of my head, my head

Baruch Adonai 
 Elohey Yisrael Adonai 
 Blessed is the Lord 
 Baruch Adonai 
 Elohey Yisrael Adonai 
 Blessed is the Lord 
 Min ha-olam, vad ha-olam 
 Praise His name forever and again 
 Min ha-olam, vad ha-olam 
 Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel 
 So let the nations sing and praise Him 
 And Israel will say, Amen! 
 Sing all you nations, Hallelu-Yah 
 And Israel will say amen 
 And Israel will say... 
 When the shout of the Lord is in our camp 
 It's the sound of victory 
 For the power of His voice will rout the enemy 
 There's no weapon that can defeat us here 
 We will triumph on every side 
 More than conquerors through the might of Adonai 
 Though the walls they stand before us 
 Hem us in on every side 
 They come crashing down 
 When they hear the sound 
 Of the name above all other 
 Yeshua HaMashiach, El Gibbor You're the mighty God! 
 Jehovah Nissi raise Your banner higher! 
 The rock of our Salvation 
 The messiah our Righteousness 
 Adonai Yireh my Provider 
 El Shaddai!

Great and marvelous are Your works 
 O Lord Almighty 
 True and righteous are all your ways 
 King of the ages 
 Who will not fear You O Lord 
 Glorify Your name 
 Behold the Lord 
 God is my salvation 
 In Him I trust 
 And will not be afraid 
 And I will give thanks 
 Sing among the nations forever 
 Behold the Lord 
 Behold the Lord 
 Behold the Lord 
 So rejoice and be glad in this 
 Our God is with us 
 Messiah Emanuel 
 Lion of Judah 
 Lift up your voice and declare 
 The glory of our King 
 Behold the Lord 
 God is my salvation 
 In Him I trust 
 And will not be afraid 
 And I will give thanks 
 Sing among the nations forever 
 Behold the Lord 
 Behold the Lord 
 Behold the Lord 
 God is our salvation 
 Glorious One 
 The Lamb upon the throne 
 Honor and praise 
 To You who reigns forever and ever 
 Behold the Lord 
 Behold the Lord 
 Behold the Lord

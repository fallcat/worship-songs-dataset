Bless the Lord Oh my soul 
 And all that is within in me 
 Bless his Holy name. 
 Bless the Lord Oh my soul 
 Forget not all his goodness, 
 Bless his Holy name. 
 He healed all my diseases, 
 Forgiven all my sins, 
 Redeemed me from the evil one 
 And seated me with him 
 Bless the Lord Oh my soul 
 And all that is within in me 
 Bless his Holy name. 
 Bless the Lord Oh my soul 
 Forget not all his goodness, 
 Bless his Holy name. 
 He's crowned me with compassion 
 And filled me with his love 
 Refreshes me with good things 
 From the storehouse of the Lord 
 Bless the Lord Oh my soul 
 And all that is within in me 
 Bless his Holy name. 
 Bless the Lord Oh my soul 
 Forget not all his goodness, 
 Bless his Holy name, 
 Bless his Holy name, 
 Bless his Holy name...

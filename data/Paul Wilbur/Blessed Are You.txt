Blessed are You, O Lord our God 
 Eternity's holy King 
 Blessed are You, O Lord our God 
 Whose word brings on the evening

 With understanding You order the seasons 
 Creating day and night, turning darkness into light 
 Arranging the stars to Your pleasing

 Lord of hosts is Your name 
 O Everliving God, rule over us 
 Now and forever the same

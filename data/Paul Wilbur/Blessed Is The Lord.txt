He who makes the rivers run to desert land 
 He who makes a pathway in the wilderness 
 He who makes the sun to rise and rain to fall 
 The God of Israel, The Lord of all

 He who brings salvation out of Zion's hill 
 He who makes the mountains quake and idols to fall 
 There is no other one, no other God

Come let us go up to Zion 
 Let us draw near 
 To the Lord our God; 
 Come let us go up to Zion 
 Let us draw near 
 To the presence of the Lord. 
 You have come To the Judge of the ages 
 Unto Jesus and to His blood; 
 You have come to the church of the firstborn 
 And to the righteous ones. 
 And there are thousands 
 And thousands of mighty angels 
 Before the Throne 
 This is the Kingdom That cannot be shaken, 
 Worship God alone. 
 Come let us go up to Zion 
 Let us draw near 
 To the Lord our God; 
 Come let us go up to Zion 
 Let us draw near 
 To the presence of the Lord. 
 Let us draw near 
 To the presence of the Lord.

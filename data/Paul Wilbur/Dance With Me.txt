Dance with me 
 O lover of my soul 
 To the song of all songs 
 Romance me 
 O lover of my soul 
 To the song of all songs 
 Behold You have come 
 Over the hills 
 Upon the mountains 
 To me You have run 
 My beloved 
 You've captured my heart 
 With You I will go 
 You are my love 
 You are my fair one 
 Winter is past 
 And the springtime has come 
 Dance with me

You sit enthroned above the circle of the earth 
 Spreading out the heavens like a veil 
 You hold the universe so firmly in Your hand 
 Reaching out in love to all the world

 Holy is Your Name

 Mysteries beyond the reach of man 
 No one else commands the sun to rise and then to fall 
 All creation heeds the great I AM

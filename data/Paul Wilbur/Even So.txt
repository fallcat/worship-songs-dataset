Even so, even so, 
 Even so Yeshua come 
 All creation cries for the returning of our King 
 Come and take your place 
 On your Throne Jerusalem 
 You are welcome in this place 
 Be enthroned upon our praises 
 May our worship rise like incense as we magnify the Son 
 Mighty God of Israel, Lamb upon the throne 
 All blessing and honor to our God forevermore 
 Even so, even so, 
 Even so Lord Jesus come 
 All creation cries for the returning of our King. 
 Come and take your place 
 On your Throne Jerusalem 
 We join our hearts together 
 We come in one accord 
 The bonds of peace unite us 
 In the Spirit of the Lord 
 You'll clothe us with salvation in robes of purest white 
 The body of Messiah we are precious in Your sight 
 Even so, even so, 
 Even so Yeshua come 
 All creation cries for the returning of our King. 
 Come and take your place 
 On your Throne Jerusalem 
 And the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 And the Spirit and the Bride say come 
 To the Lion and the Lamb 
 Heaven's King, the great I Am 
 Come and take your place on your throne Jerusalem 
 Even so, even so, 
 Even so Yeshua come 
 All creation cries for the returning of our King. 
 Come and take your place 
 On your Throne Jerusalem 
 Even so, even so, 
 Even so Yeshua come 
 All creation cries for the returning of our King. 
 Come and take your place 
 On your Throne Jerusalem 
 Come and take your place on your throne Jerusalem 
 Come and take your place on your throne Jerusalem

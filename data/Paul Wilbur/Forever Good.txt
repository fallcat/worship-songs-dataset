Through deserts wide and oceans deep 
 When troubles pressed us to our knees, 
 You remain through everything 
 The song we sing: 
 You are good, 
 You are good, 
 Your love is great, 
 Your love endures 
 Through every thing our hearts are sure 
 You are good, forever good 
 Through every dark uncertain day 
 The fears arise we are not afraid. 
 You never change through all eternity, 
 It's who You are, it's why we sing: 
 You are good, 
 You are good, 
 Your love is great, 
 Your love endures 
 Through every thing our hearts are sure 
 You are good, forever good 
 From generation to generation 
 You've been our hope, Lord, and our salvation. 
 We say with Heaven and all creation: 
 We're not alone here, we're not forsaken. 
 You are good, 
 You are good, 
 Your love is great, 
 Your love endures 
 Through every thing our hearts are sure 
 You are good, forever good 
 You are good, forever... good

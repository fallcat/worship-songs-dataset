I long to find You 
 In Your secret place oh God 
 Under the shadow of Your wings 
 Here in Your presence 
 There is no place I'd rather be 
 I need You more than anything 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 A sound of heaven like a mighty rushing wind 
 Rise up and worship as we sing 
 All creation longs to hear the joy of sound 
 Of the returning of our king 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 And the Spirit and the Bride say, "Come" 
 And let him who hears say, "Come" 
 And let those who are thirsty say,"Come" 
 Even so Lord, "Come" 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down 
 Glory come down

I wanna be close, close to Your side 
 Where Heaven is real and death is a lie 
 I wanna hear voices of angels above 
 Singing as one 
 Hallelujah, Holy, Holy 
 God Almighty, Great I AM 
 Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
 God Almighty, Great I AM 
 I wanna be near, near to Your heart 
 Loving the world, hating the dark 
 I wanna see dry bones living again 
 Singing as one 
 Hallelujah, Holy, Holy 
 God Almighty, the Great I AM 
 Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
 God Almighty, the Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The mountains shake before Him 
 The demons run and flee 
 At the mention of Your name 
 King of Majesty 
 There is no power in hell 
 Or any who can stand 
 Before the power and the presence 
 Of the Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 The Great I AM 
 Hallelujah, Holy, Holy 
 God Almighty, Great I AM 
 Who is worthy, none beside thee 
 God Almighty, Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 You're the Great I AM 
 You're the Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 The mountains shake before Him 
 The demons run and flee 
 At the mention of Your name 
 King of Majesty 
 There is no power in hell 
 Or any who can stand 
 Before the power and the presence 
 Of the Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 Hallelujah, Holy, Holy 
 God Almighty, Great I AM 
 Who is worthy, none beside thee 
 God Almighty, Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 You're, You're, Oh 
 Great I AM 
 Great I AM 
 Great I AM

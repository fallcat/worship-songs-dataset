Praise Him with the cymbal 
 Praise Him with the dance 
 Praise Him with the shofar 
 Praise Him with your hands 
 Praise Him with the timbrel 
 Praise Him with the harp 
 Praise Him with the drum and the flute 
 Praise Him with your heart 
 Hallelu Et Adonai 
 Hallelu Et Adonai 
 Hallelu Et Adonai 
 Come and praise the Lord 
 Praise Him in the heavens 
 Praise Him moon and stars 
 Praise Him for His glory and power 
 Praise Him with guitars 
 Praise Him in the battle 
 Praise Him in the storm 
 Praise Him for the victory's won 
 Praise Him with this song 
 Hallelu Et Adonai 
 Hallelu Et Adonai 
 Hallelu Et Adonai 
 Come and praise the Lord 
 And let everything that has breath 
 Come and praise the Lord

You bind the broken hearted 
 You heal the wounded soul 
 Father of all heaven 
 We give You full control 
 Come have Your way in us, O Lord 
 Come set our spirits free 
 O Father send revival 
 And start the work in me 
 Lord, I hunger, thirst for Your righteousness 
 Father come and fill me once again 
 Lord, I hunger, thirst for Your righteousness 
 Fill me with Your oil and Your wine 
 Fill me with Your Spirit 
 I want to see Your face 
 To live in Your presence 
 Know Your glory and Your grace 
 It's not my will but Yours I choose 
 To follow to the end 
 So mold me, yes, and make me 
 Let a new day begin 
 Lord, I hunger, thirst for Your righteousness 
 Spirit come and fill me once again 
 Lord, I hunger, thirst for Your righteousness 
 Fill me with Your oil and Your wine 
 Lord, I hunger, thirst for Your righteousness 
 Jesus come and fill me once again 
 Lord, I hunger, thirst for Your righteousness 
 Fill me with Your oil and Your wine

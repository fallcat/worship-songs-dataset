You shall reign over all the earth 
 You shall reign over all the earth 
 You shall reign over all the earth 
 You shall reign over all the earth 
 There shall come forth a rod out of Jesse 
 And a branch shall grow from his roots 
 The Spirit of God will rest upon you 
 The Spirit of wisdom and truth 
 You shall not judge with the sight of Your eyes 
 Or decide with he hearing of Your ears 
 But with righteousness judge the poor 
 And decide with fairness for the meek 
 You shall gather the outcast of Israel 
 The dispersed of Judea from all the earth 
 You shall stand as an ensign for Your people 
 And Your resting place shall be glorious 
 Come and reign over all the earth 
 Come and reign over all the earth 
 Come and reign over all the earth 
 Come and reign over all the earth

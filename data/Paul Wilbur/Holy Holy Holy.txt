Holy Holy Holy 
 Is the God of Israel 
 Elders bow in worship 
 As the angel voices swell 
 Fragrant clouds of incense 
 Swirl around Your throne of grace 
 Lord we bow in worship 
 At the brilliance of Your face 
 We cry 
 Holy Holy Holy is the Lord 
 Holy Holy Holy is the Lord 
 Holy Holy Holy 
 Is the song that Heaven sings 
 All creation praise Him 
 Hallelujah Elohim 
 Come to reign forever 
 King of kings and Lord of lords 
 Lift your head O Zion 
 Open wide you ancient doors 
 And cry

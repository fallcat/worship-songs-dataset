I hear a sound coming from the mountain, 
 I hear it louder each day. 
 I hear a sound coming from the mountain, 
 And it says, "Prepare ye the way." 
 Prepare ye the way, 
 Prepare ye the way, 
 Prepare ye the way 
 Of the Lord. 
 I see the King standing on the mountain, 
 I see Him clearer each day. 
 I see the King standing on the mountain, 
 And He says, "Prepare ye the way." 
 Prepare ye the way, 
 Prepare ye the way, 
 Prepare ye the way 
 Of the Lord.

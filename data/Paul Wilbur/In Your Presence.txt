In Your presence 
 That's where I am strong 
 In Your presence 
 O Lord my God 
 In Your presence 
 That's where I belong 
 Seeking Your face 
 Touching Your grace 
 In the cleft of the Rock 
 In Your presence O God 
 I want to go 
 Where the rivers 
 Cannot overflow me 
 Where my feet are 
 On the rock 
 I want to hide 
 Where the blazing 
 Fire cannot burn me 
 In Your presence O God 
 I want to hide 
 Where the flood of 
 Evil cannot reach me 
 Where I'm covered by the blood 
 I want to be where 
 The schemes of darkness 
 Cannot touch me 
 In Your presence O God 
 You are my firm foundation 
 I trust in You all day long 
 I am Your child 
 And Your servant 
 And You are my 
 Strength and my song 
 You're my song 
 Seeking Your face 
 Touching Your grace 
 In the cleft of the Rock 
 In Your presence O God 
 In Your presence

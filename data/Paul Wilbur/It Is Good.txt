It is good to praise the Lord 
 And make music to your name, o God Most High 
 To proclaim your love and faithfulness 
 All the day and through the night 
 Lai, lai, lai... 
 You make me glad by your deeds, o Lord 
 So I sing for joy at all your hands have made 
 How great are Your works, o Lord! 
 Elohim, baruch HaShem 
 May I dwell in Your courts, o Lord 
 Then to flourish like the trees of Lebanon 
 Planted in the house of Adonai 
 There to live forevermore!

Lift up your gates be lifted up 
 And let the King of Glory come 
 Lift up your heads you ancient doors 
 Lift up a shout unto the Lord 
 O-oh, You are Lord of earth 
 You are Lord of life 
 O-oh, King of Glory come 
 And fill this place 
 Today, today, whoa

 We lift our eyes to see Your face 
 You are the all-consuming fire 
 Your presence is our one desire 
 O-oh, You are Lord of earth 
 You are Lord of life 
 O-oh, King of Glory come 
 And fill this place 
 Today, today, whoa 
 Today, today, whoa

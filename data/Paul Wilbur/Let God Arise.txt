Let God Arise 
 Let God Arise 
 Let His Enemies be scattered 
 But let the righteous be glad 
 Yes let them rejoice with Gladness 
 God has triumphed mightily 
 Let God Arise 
 Let God Arise 
 Let His enemies be scattered 
 And let the righteous be glad 
 Yes! Let them regoice with gladness 
 God has triumph mightily 
 It is good to praise the Lord 
 And make music to your Name Oh God Most High 
 To proclaim your love and faithfulness 
 Through the day and through the night 
 May I dwell in your courts Oh Lord 
 Then to florish like the trees of Lebanon 
 Planted in the house of Adoni 
 There to live forevermore 
 Roni Roni Bat Zion 
 Hariu Yisrael 
 Simchi V'Altsi B'Chol Lev 
 Bat Yerushalayim 
 Rejoice Rejoice Daughter of Zion 
 Shout aloud Oh Israel 
 Sing Rejoice with all your heart 
 Oh Jerusalem 
 For the Lord has taken your punishment 
 Destroyed your enemies 
 King of Israel 
 Lord of all is He 
 In the midst of us He is mighty 
 For the Lord your God in the midst of you 
 Mighty is His Name 
 Rejoicing over you with Songs of Gladness 
 Singing Joyfully 
 He will save us

 Spirit of the sovereign Lord 
 Come and make Your presence known 
 Reveal the glory of the Living God 
 Refr√£o: 
 Let the weight of Your glory cover us 
 Let the life of Your river flow 
 Let the truth of Your kingdom reign in us 
 Let the weight of Your glory 
 Let the weight of Your glory fall 
 We do not seek Your hand 
 We only seek Your face 
 We want to know You 
 We want to see You 
 Reveal Your glory in this place

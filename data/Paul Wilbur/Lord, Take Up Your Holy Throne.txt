Lord take up Your holy Throne 
 Deep within my heart 
 Take the place that is yours alone 
 Deep within my heart 
 And of the increase 
 Of Your government 
 There shall be no end 
 There shall be no end 
 There shall be no end 
 You are worthy Lord to reign 
 Lord take up Your holy throne 
 Throughout this land 
 Take the place that is Yours alone 
 Throughout all this land 
 Lord take up Your holy Throne 
 Throughout all the earth 
 Take the place that is Yours alone 
 Throughout all the earth

Trembling in awe at the sound of his voice 
 The roar of a thousand waterfalls 
 Hair white as snow and his eyes full of fire 
 His face a brilliant sun 
 Royal and dressed in the finest of robes 
 Wrapped in a sash of purest gold 
 Thousands are singing a song to the lamb 
 Exploding in praise to the matchless I am 
 Mighty and glorious 
 You are victorious 
 O god the sovereign and strong 
 Exalted and powerful 
 Fearful and wonderful 
 O god the infinite one 
 We cry holy, holy is the lamb 
 Holy is the lamb 
 There on the throne is the son of man 
 Gleaming with mercy and righteousness 
 High priest of god and the king of all kings 
 Crowned with many crowns 
 Saints gather 'round on a sea of glass 
 Worship the one who is first and last 
 Thousands are singing a song to the lamb 
 Exploding in praise to the matchless I am 
 Mighty and glorious 
 You are victorious 
 O god the sovereign and strong 
 Exalted and powerful 
 Fearful and wonderful 
 O god the infinite one 
 We cry holy 
 Holy is the lamb 
 Holy, holy 
 Singing holy, holy 
 Singing holy, holy 
 Holy is the lamb 
 You are holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 You are holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Singing holy 
 Holy is the lamb 
 You are mighty and glorious 
 You are victorious 
 O god the sovereign and strong 
 Exalted and powerful 
 Fearful and wonderful 
 O god the infinite one 
 We cry holy, holy 
 We cry holy, holy 
 We cry holy 
 Holy is the lamb 
 Holy is the lamb

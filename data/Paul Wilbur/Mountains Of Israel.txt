From the beginning to the end it's been* 
 This way Your promises they never change 
 Your people will never be put to shame 
 From the desert to the endless sea 
 Shores of Egypt to the eastern hills 
 The earth and the sky tremble at Your will 
 Wake up and call on the name of the Lord 
 Weak be made strong you have now been restored 
 Oh the darkness is light 
 Oh Your kingdom is now in sight 
 Lord God of Israel arise 
 Consume us now with Your fire 
 Every people and tribe 
 Mountains of Israel come alive 
 It's time to bring forth new wine 
 From now to the end of time 
 Spirit pouring out from all around 
 Living waters now they're raining down 
 The day of the Lord is at hand 
 Can you hear the voice in the desert calling out 
 Prepare the way 
 The way for the Lord make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God 
 Come like a mighty lion roar with Your glory and Your fire 
 Come now with Your power 
 Bo Yeshua Mishecheynu Your people wanna see You 
 Oh the darkness is light 
 Oh Your kingdom is now in sight it's now in sight yeah

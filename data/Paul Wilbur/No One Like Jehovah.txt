God of Abraham, God of Isaac, 
 God of Jacob, Elohim, Adonai, 
 God who answers by fire 
 Glorify Your Son, Jesus Christ, the true Messiah 
 Breathe on us, send us out, in the spirit of Elijah 
 The sick are healed, the blind can see 
 The cripples dance, the demons flee 
 At the name of Jesus, every knee will bow 
 The dead are raised, the deaf can hear 
 As we proclaim, "The Kingdom is here" 
 At the name of Jesus, every tongue will shout 
 There is no one like our God 
 There is no one like Jehovah 
 You are worthy, forever worthy 
 Jesus Christ, the same, yesterday, today, forever 
 King of kings, Lord of lords, 
 Only Son of the Living God 
 Rise up in Your Bride, show Your power, show Your glory 
 Breathe on us, send us out, in the spirit of Elijah 
 There is no one like You 
 There is no one like You 
 There is no one like You, Jesus

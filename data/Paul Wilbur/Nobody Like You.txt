Lord of all 
 I bow down at your feet 
 All to you Lord 
 I give, all of me 
 My soul long to behold who you are 
 Holy, is the Lord of glory 
 We lift our voice 
 And sing to You our King 
 Worthy, You alone are Worthy 
 We lift our voice and sing to You 
 Our King

 Nobody like You

 We've come to sing it out 
 Nobody like You

 We've come to sing it out 
 Nobody like You

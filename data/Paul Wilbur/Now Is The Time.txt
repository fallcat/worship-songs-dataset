We know You're searching 
 Roaming the earth 
 Seeking a people who'll obey Your word 
 Oh count us among them now is the time 
 Make us the temples of Your holy fire 
 Our hearts are thirsty send forth a flood 
 This generation needs to know Your love 
 Boldly we cry out now is the time 
 Make us the temples of Your holy fire 
 Make us the temples of Your holy fire 
 Let You glory shine 
 Come consume our lives 
 Pour out Your Spirit 
 Fan every flame 
 Burn with a brightness that can't be contained 
 Fall on these altars now is the time 
 Make us the temples of Your holy fire 
 Make us the temples of Your holy fire 
 Wind of the Spirit blow 
 Make heaven's glory known 
 Come with compassion fill every soul 
 Wind of the Spirit blow 
 River of life run deep 
 Fountain of grace flow free 
 We are Your garden water Your seed 
 River of life run deep 
 River of life run deep

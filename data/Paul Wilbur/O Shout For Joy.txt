Halle hallelujah 
 O shout for joy 
 When the fallen tent of David 
 Has been restored 
 I'll bring back the captives of my people 
 My people Israel 
 They shall build the broken walls and cities 
 And live in them 
 I will call my people from the nations 
 I'll plant them in their land 
 They shall grow and flourish as a vineyard 
 Not be moved again 
 Halle hallelujah 
 O shout for joy 
 When the fallen tent of David 
 Has been restored 
 I will reap a harvest from the nations 
 I'll bring them by the hand 
 Jew and gentile worshiping together 
 As one new man 
 Strike the harp and play upon the timbrel 
 O children dance and sing 
 Shout for joy 
 Worship Him forever 
 Messiah King 
 Messiah King 
 Halle hallelujah 
 O shout for joy 
 When the fallen tent of David 
 Has been restored 
 Halle hallelujah 
 O shout for joy 
 When the fallen tent of David 
 Has been restored

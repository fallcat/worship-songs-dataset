We were born in a time of trial 
 We were born on a battlefield 
 We were born for such a time as this 
 We were born for a true revival 
 We were born for a harvest field 
 We were born for such a time as this 
 So let the earth shake, let the stars fall 
 Let the mountains tremble, we are not afraid 
 Let the people, let the faithful stand and say 
 Prepare the way, He was 
 Prepare the way, He is 
 Prepare the way, He is to come 
 This is the sound of a generation 
 This is the song of the Warrior King 
 We were born for such a time as this 
 He will return with the declaration 
 When He appears every eye will see 
 We were born for such a time as this 
 So let the earth shake, let the stars fall 
 Let the mountains tremble, we are not afraid 
 Let the people, let the faithful stand and say 
 Prepare the way, He was 
 Prepare the way, He is 
 Prepare the way, He is to come 
 Prepare the way, He was 
 Prepare the way, He is 
 Prepare the way, He is to come 
 So let the earth shake, let the stars fall 
 Let the mountains tremble, we are not afraid 
 Let the people, let the faithful stand and say 
 Prepare the way, He was 
 Prepare the way, He is 
 Prepare the way, He is to come 
 Prepare the way, He was 
 Prepare the way, He is 
 Prepare the way, He is to come 
 Prepare the way, He was 
 Prepare the way, He is 
 Prepare the way, He is to come 
 Prepare the way, He was 
 Prepare the way, He is 
 Prepare the way, He is to come

I will say to the mountain that stands in my way 
 Be removed now and cast in the sea 
 I believe that those things which I say come to pass 
 And have what so ever I say 
 Yes I have what so ever I say 
 I will walk by what God says 
 And not by what I see 
 For those things are temporal 
 They're subject to be changed 
 I hold fast to my confession 
 I won't change my mind 
 God has promised He will do it 
 He's faithful all the time

Shalom shalom Jerusalem 
 Peace be to you 
 When messiah comes to take us home 
 May his praise be found in you 
 Pray for peace Jerusalem 
 City of our god 
 There salvation was poured out for you 
 The atoning of the lord 
 Once your streets, filled with joy 
 Branches raised up high 
 Shouting, "Blessed, be the holy one" 
 Yeshua t'Adonai 
 Shalom shalom Jerusalem 
 Peace be to you 
 When messiah comes to take us home 
 May his praise be found in you 
 Israel beloved 
 Ephraim, my son (Ephraim, my son) 
 How my heart would thrill to hear you say 
 The messiah has come 
 O my brothers hear these words 
 May they pierce your soul 
 Turn again to worship Adonai 
 Messiah you will bow 
 Shalom shalom Jerusalem 
 Peace be to you 
 When messiah comes to take us home 
 May his praise be found in you 
 Shalom shalom Jerusalem 
 Peace be to you 
 When messiah comes to take us home 
 May his praise be found in you 
 May his praise be found in you

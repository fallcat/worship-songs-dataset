May the Lord answer you 
 When you are in distress 
 May the name of the God of Jacob 
 Protect you protect you 
 We will shout for joy 
 When you are victorious 
 And will lift up our banners 
 In the name of our God 
 May He send you help from the sanctuary 
 And grant you support from Zion 
 May He give you the desire of your heart 
 And make all your plans succeed

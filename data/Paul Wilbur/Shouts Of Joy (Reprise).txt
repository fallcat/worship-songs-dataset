With shouts of joy 
 And victory resound in the tents 
 Of the righteous of the Lord 
 Shouts of joy 
 And victory resound in the tents 
 Of the righteous of the Lord 
 The Lord's right hand 
 Has done mighty things for us 
 The Lord's right hand 
 Is lifted high 
 The Lord's right hand 
 Has done mighty things for us 
 The Lord's right hand reigns on high 
 The Lord's right hand reigns on high 
 The Lord's right hand reigns on high

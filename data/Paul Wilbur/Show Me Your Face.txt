Show me Your face, Lord 
 Show me Your face 
 Then gird up my legs that I might stand in this holy place 
 Show me Your face, Lord 
 Your power and grace 
 I could make it to the end if I can just see Your face 
 Moses stood on the mountain 
 Waiting for You to pass by 
 You put Your hand over his face 
 So in Your presence he wouldn't die 
 All of Israel saw the glory 
 And it shines down through the age 
 Now You've called me to boldly seek Your face 
 David knew there was something more 
 Than the ark of Your presence 
 And in a manger a baby was born 
 Among kings and peasants 
 All of Israel saw the glory 
 And it shines down through the age 
 And now You call us to boldly seek Your face 
 Show me Your face, Lord 
 Show me Your face 
 Then gird up my legs that I might stand in this holy place 
 Show me Your face, Lord 
 Your power and grace 
 I could make it to the end if I can just see Your face 
 Yes we can make it to the end if we can just see Your face.

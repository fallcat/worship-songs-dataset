Come let us sing for 
 Joy to the Lord 
 Let us shout aloud 
 To the Rock of our salvation 
 Let us come before 
 Him with thanksgiving 
 And extol Him with 
 Music and with song 
 Sing halle, hallelujah 
 Sing hallelujah 
 Sing halle, hallelujah 
 Sing halle, hallelujah 
 Come let us bow 
 Down in worship 
 Let us kneel before 
 The Lord our Maker 
 For He is our God 
 And we belong to Him 
 We are His people 
 The flock under His care 
 Come bring your praises 
 To the Lord 
 Shout aloud to the 
 Rock of our salvation 
 Holy holy is the Lord

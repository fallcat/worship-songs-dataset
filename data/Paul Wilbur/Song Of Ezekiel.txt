I hear the sound of the prophet 
 Declaring the word of the Lord 
 And I hear the voice of Ezekiel 
 Prophesying to these dry bones 
 Live again, live again 
 Those who were sleeping 
 Those in the grave 
 Live again, live again 
 Those who were sleeping 
 Those in the grave 
 Live again 
 I hear the sound of an army 
 A nation preparing for war 
 And I can hear Judah assembling 
 Praise is their weapon of war 
 Live again, live again 
 Those who were sleeping 
 Those in the grave 
 Live again, live again 
 Those who were sleeping 
 Those in the grave 
 Live again 
 Breath of God from the four winds blow 
 Breathe life again to these dry bones 
 Breath of God from the four winds blow 
 Breathe life again to these dry bones 
 Arise, arise, arise 
 Here and now 
 Arise, arise, arise 
 Here and now 
 Oh arise 
 I hear the voice of the watchman 
 Cry from his place on the wall 
 Awaken the remnant of Zion 
 Salvation for all Israel 
 Live again, live again 
 Those who were sleeping 
 Those in the grave 
 Live again, live again 
 Those who were sleeping 
 Those in the grave 
 Live again

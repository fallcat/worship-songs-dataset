There is a noise 
 There is a sound 
 There is a cry from the depths of our hearts 
 Heaven come down 
 Will not be silenced 
 Can't be contained 
 The cry of a people 
 A priesthood, a nation 
 Called by Your name 
 Out of the darkness 
 Redeemed from the night 
 Bathed in His glory 
 Reflecting His light 
 Oh what a beautiful bride 
 From every nation 
 From every tribe 
 Clothed with His righteousness 
 Fully alive 
 Hear the song of the beautiful bride 
 Oh what a mystery 
 How great the love 
 Goes to the broken 
 The orphan, the chosen 
 Making us one 
 And under His hand 
 United we stand 
 Bearing the goodness 
 The beautiful mercy 
 Of Great I AM 
 Out of the darkness 
 Redeemed from the night 
 Bathed in His glory 
 Reflecting His light 
 Oh what a beautiful bride 
 From every nation 
 From every tribe 
 Clothed with His righteousness 
 Fully alive 
 Hear the song of the beautiful bride 
 Singing 
 How great and marvelous are all your deeds 
 Nations will come 
 And bow down at Your feet 
 Glory to You Lord of all 
 King of all kings, we sing 
 How great and marvelous are all your deeds 
 Nations will come 
 And bow down at Your feet 
 Glory to You Lord of all 
 King of all kings 
 Out of the darkness 
 Redeemed from the night 
 Bathed in His glory 
 Reflecting His light 
 Oh what a beautiful bride 
 From every nation 
 From every tribe 
 Clothed with His righteousness 
 Fully alive 
 Hear the song of the beautiful bride 
 Hear the song of Your bride 
 Song of the bride 
 Dance with me 
 Hear the song of Your bride 
 Lover of my soul 
 Lover of my soul 
 Hear the song of Your bride

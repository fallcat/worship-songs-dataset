Who is like the Lord 
 There is no one 
 Who is like the Lord 
 He is strong and mighty 
 Who is like the Lord 
 He is worthy 
 Stand up and give Him the praise 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Our God is worthy of glory 
 From the rising of the sun 
 To it's going down 
 The name of the Lord is to be praised 
 Stand up and praise Him 
 And give Him the glory 
 Our God is worthy of praise 
 Stand up and give Him the praise 
 Stand up and give Him the praise 
 Stand up and give Him the praise 
 Stand up and give Him the praise 
 Praise the Lord

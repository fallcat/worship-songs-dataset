Who can endure on the day of Your coming 
 Who will be able to stand 
 You will return like refiner's fire 
 Who will be saved by Your hand 
 You make a way by the blood of Your sacrifice 
 Poured out on Calvary's tree 
 Now in Your presence 
 Your glory and righteousness 
 Stir up a passion in me 
 The fire of Your love is burning within me 
 Consuming my heart 
 Restoring my soul 
 My only desire to abide in Your holiness 
 Here in the fire of Your love 
 Here in the fire of Your love 
 Though You were blameless 
 You laid down Your life for us 
 Bearing the weight of our sin 
 Come with the power that raised You victorious 
 Pour out Your presence again

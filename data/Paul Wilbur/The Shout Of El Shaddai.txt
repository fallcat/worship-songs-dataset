Can you hear it thunder in the distance? 
 When We worship the Lion of Judah roars 
 Strong holds crumble all around us 
 In the presence of our Lord 
 There'll be vic'try in the camp 
 At the shout of el Shaddai 
 Every enemy will flee from the fire in His eyes 
 Every captive will be freed in this year of Jubilee 
 When we hear the shout of el Shaddai 
 Can you hear it thunder in the distance? 
 When We worship the Lion of Judah roars 
 Strong holds crumble all around us 
 In the presence of our Lord 
 There'll be vic'try in the camp 
 At the shout of el Shaddai 
 Every enemy will flee from the fire in His eyes 
 Every captive will be freed in this year of Jubilee 
 When we hear the shout of el Shaddai 
 In your name power of darkness tremble 
 Jericho thumbles to the ground 
 In your name chains of death are broken 
 Lord of Hosts pour your power out 
 We have overcome by the name and the blood 
 Of the Lamb of God 
 Every wall must fall, every knee must bow 
 To the Lord of all 
 In your name every curse is broken 
 Sin and death underneath your feet 
 In your name we will bow before you 
 Every tribe and every tongue will sing 
 We have overcome by the name and the blood 
 Of the Lamb of God 
 Every wall must fall, every knee must bow 
 To the Lord of all 
 There'll be vic'try in the camp 
 At the shout of el Shaddai 
 Every enemy will flee from the fire in His eyes 
 Every captive will be freed in this year of Jubilee 
 When we hear the shout of el Shaddai 
 When we hear the shout of el Shaddai 
 When we hear the shout of el Shaddai 
 Can you hear it thunder in the distance? 
 When We worship the Lion of Judah roars 
 Strong holds crumble all around us 
 At the presence of our Lord...

The walls will come down 
 With a shout of praise 
 The walls will come down 
 With a shout of joy 
 The walls will come down 
 With a shout of triumph 
 To the Lord God Almighty 
 With the sword of the Spirit in our hands 
 The word of God in our mouth 
 With the blod of Jesus to set us free 
 We have the victory

I was glad when 
 They said to me 
 Come to the 
 House of the Lord 
 Standing here in 
 Your gates again 
 Up to Jerusalem 
 Up to Jerusalem 
 Up to Jerusalem 
 Jerusalem, peace 
 Adonai Sar Shalom 
 Blessing be yours 
 God's peace within your walls 
 Up to Jerusalem 
 Up to Jerusalem 
 City of praise 
 Where the tribes shout Hallel 
 We lift our voice 
 To the God of Israel

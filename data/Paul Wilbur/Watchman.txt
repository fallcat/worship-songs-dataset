God has placed a watchman on your walls 
 Oh Jerusalem 
 They will not be silent day or night 
 Of the Lord they make constant mention 
 They will give no sleep to their eyes 
 Until God establishes grace 
 There will be no peace in their nights 
 Until the Lord makes Jerusalem a praise 
 He has sworn it by His strength 
 If you lift up your voices and call on the Lord 
 He will come 
 And the nations will see that salvation comes 
 From Zion 
 Oh no more waiting the anointing of God 
 Has begun 
 Oh blind eye will see as the captives go free 
 If you lift up your voices He'll come 
 Behold the Lord has proclaimed this to 
 Ends of the earth 
 And though there's fear in your 
 Streets tonight 
 Something's already birthed 
 Tabernacle is rising right now 
 In the hearts of those who believe 
 There's the sound of a freedom shout 
 Rising up from under your feet 
 If you lift up your voices and call on the Lord 
 He will come 
 And the nations will see that salvation comes 
 From Zion 
 Oh no more waiting the anointing of God 
 Has begun 
 Oh blind eye will see as the captives go free 
 If you lift up your voices He'll come

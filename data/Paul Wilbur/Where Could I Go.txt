Blessed is the morning sky 
 Revealing Your perfect light 
 O Star of the morning 
 There is no depth or height 
 Where I can escape Your sight 
 O King of Glory 
 Heaven and earth will pass away 
 But You will still remain 
 Oh, where could I go? 
 I could not run from You, Yeshua 
 Where, where could I hide? 
 Your love would find me there, Yeshua 
 Through all my days and nights 
 Sleeping and when I rise 
 Lord, You are with me 
 You know my thoughts and dreams 
 The best and the worst of me 
 You know me completely 
 And if I arise on the wings of the dawn 
 Your right hand will hold me 
 Oh, where could I go? 
 I could not run from You, Yeshua 
 Where, where could I hide? 
 Your love would find me there, Yeshua 
 You hold the stars 
 You're the keeper of time 
 You're the author of my story 
 Alpha, Omega, Creator of all 
 Nothing can contain Your glory 
 Oh, where could I go? 
 I could not run from You, Yeshua 
 Where, where could I hide? 
 Your love would find me there, Yeshua 
 Oh, where could I go? 
 I could not run from You, Yeshua 
 Where, where could I hide? 
 Your love would find me there, Yeshua 
 Yeshua...

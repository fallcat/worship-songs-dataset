I lift up my eyes to the hills 
 Where does my help come from 
 My help comes from the Lord 
 Maker of Heaven and earth 
 O Maker of Heaven and earth 
 Your foot shall never be moved 
 You'll never stumble 
 Or slip no never 
 He who watches Israel 
 He never slumbers or sleeps 
 No He never slumbers or sleeps 
 The Lord will keep you from harm 
 He watches over your soul 
 He will watch you come and go 
 Now and forevermore forever 
 Now and forevermore 
 O Maker of Heaven and earth 
 O Maker of Heaven and earth

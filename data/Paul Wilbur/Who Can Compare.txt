You rule the oceans and the seas 
 Subdue the storm tossed waves for me 
 God You are awesome 
 All of Heaven declares Your name 
 Wondrous beauty, Your majesty

 Who can compare, who can compare 
 To Your great love? 
 None can compare, none can compare 
 To all You've done!

 You're the name above all names

 My heart can not contain all You are 
 And Your faithfulness endures forever 
 El Shaddai, Elohai, Adon Olam 
 El Shaddai, Elohai, Adon Olam

 All the earth will sing Your praise 
 Knees will bow, tongues proclaim

 Who can compare, who can compare 
 To Your great love? 
 None can compare, none can compare 
 To all You've done!

You set the sun in the morning sky 
 You framed the stars in the night 
 You made the heavens, the sea, and the land 
 You hold them all in the palm of Your hand 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 There is no one 
 All creation declares 
 None can compare to the greatness of our God 
 Of our God 
 You are the promise of Israel 
 The shield of Abraham 
 You conquered death, hell and the grave 
 By the power of Your blood, You are mighty to save 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 There is no one 
 All creation declares 
 None can compare to the greatness of our God 
 Of our God 
 Higher than the highest 
 Greater than the greatest 
 Lord of all creation, who is like You? 
 Stronger than the strongest 
 Purer than the purest 
 Ruler of the nations, nobody like You 
 Higher than the highest 
 Greater than the greatest 
 Lord of all creation, who is like You? 
 Stronger than the strongest 
 Purer than the purest 
 Ruler of the nations, nobody like You 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 There is no one 
 All creation declares 
 None can compare to the greatness of our God 
 Of our God 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 Who is like You oh Lord 
 There is no one 
 All creation declares 
 None can compare to the greatness of our God 
 To the greatness of our God 
 Of our God 
 Higher than the highest, God

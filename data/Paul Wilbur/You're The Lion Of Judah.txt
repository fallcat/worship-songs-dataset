You are the Lion of Judah 
 The Lamb who was slain 
 You ascended to Heaven 
 And evermore will reign 
 At the end of the age 
 When the earth You reclaim 
 You will gather the nations 
 Before You 
 And the eyes of all men 
 Will be fixed on the Lamb 
 Who was crucified 
 With wisdom and mercy 
 And justice You'll reign 
 At Your Father's side 
 And the angel will cry 
 Hail the Lamb 
 Who was slain for the world 
 Rule in power 
 And the earth will reply 
 You shall Reign 
 As the King of all kings 
 And the Lord of all lords 
 There's a shield in our hands 
 And a sword at our side 
 There's a fire in our spirits 
 That cannot be denied 
 'Cause the Father has told us 
 For these You have died 
 For the nations that gather 
 Before You 
 And the eyes of all men 
 Will be fixed on the Lamb 
 Who was crucified 
 Who descended to hell 
 Yet was raised up to reign 
 At His Father's side

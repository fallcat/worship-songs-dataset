I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I will dwell in Jerusalem 
 She shall be called The City of Truth 
 The Mountain of the Lord of Hosts, 
 Har HaKadosh for thus says the Lord, 
 "I will save my people" 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I will dwell in Jerusalem 
 The Lord will go forth 
 Whith a loud trumpet blast 
 And the shout of the Angel of God 
 The Lord shall be King 
 Over all of the Earth 
 Adonai Echad 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I will dwell in Jerusalem 
 Kin'ati LeTziyon 
 Kin'ati LeTziyon 
 Kin'ati LeTziyon 
 I will dwell in Jerusalem 
 And He will appear 
 Faithful and True 
 With justice to judge 
 And make war 
 His eyes are a fire 
 His tongue is a sword 
 Lion of Judah Roar! 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I am zealous over Zion 
 I will dwell in Jerusalem 
 Kin'ati LeTziyon 
 Kin'ati LeTziyon 
 Kin'ati LeTziyon 
 I will dwell in Jerusalem

Standing alone with my dreams and my plans 
 But I cannot find love without You 
 I'm feeling my way with my senses and discovering 
 That I cannot find love, I cannot find love 
 Without You 
 But I'm discovering Your love is so strong 
 That I believe what I knew all along 
 Love would not try to live on without You 
 I can search high on a mountain so tall 
 But I will not find love without You (not without You) 
 Or look for Your love in my people who don't know you 
 But I will not find love 
 I cannot find love 
 Without You 
 Not without You 
 Without You 
 There's no sun behind the rain 
 Without You 
 There's no reason for the pain 
 Without You 
 There's no love to help me live 
 'Cause of You 
 I believe that love is true 
 Because of You 
 I can give to others too 
 Because I know 
 That You gave the best You had to give 
 You gave your sweet Son 
 So I could live

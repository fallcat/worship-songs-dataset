Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on I Peter 4:3 
 Do you ever think about the ways you're getting older? 
 You sit around and realize your heart is colder 
 There'll come a time you'll think your youth is almost over 
 Where did it go, you'll never know so you'll just wonder 
 Did you ever want to turn the hands of time back to your 
 Childhood? 
 Back to the time you had it made, you had it so good 
 What would it take to see mistakes before they happen? 
 What would you do with all the choices that you made then? 
 It's just a matter of time 
 It'll all be over (And it makes you wonder) 
 It's just a matter of time 
 Better think about it (How did it go so fast?) 
 It's just a matter of time 
 You know you're gettin' older 
 It's just a matter of time 
 You sit around, you're all alone, the party's over 
 You think about it all again, your thoughts are sober 
 You waste away another day and then it happens 
 You're old and grey, you dream away about your past sins 
 God has a plan worth listening to 
 Not built on sand that is sifting through 
 It's not too late for redeeming the time

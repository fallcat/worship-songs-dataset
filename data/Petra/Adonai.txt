Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Genesis 15:2, Matthew 5:6, Hebrews 12:29, Psalms 40:2 
 This thirsting within my soul 
 Won't cease till I've been made whole 
 To know you, to walk with you 
 To please you in all I do 
 You uphold the righteous and your faithfulness shall endure 
 Adonai, Master of the earth and sky 
 You alone are worthy, Adonai 
 Adonai, let creation testify 
 Let your majesty be magnified in me 
 Adonai, you are an endless mystery 
 Unchanging consuming fire 
 Lift me up from mud and mire 
 Set my feet upon your rock, let me dwell in your righteousness 
 When the storms surround me, speak the word and they will be still 
 And this thirst and hunger is a longing only you can fill

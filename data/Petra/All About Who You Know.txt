You are tied-in and networked 
 You've got people to see 
 You have friends in high places 
 You've got places to be 
 You've got plenty of time to make your mark 
 You've been able to get things done 
 And all the white shirts will take your calls 
 You've really had quite a run 
 Who can you turn to 
 When your life is behind you? 
 It's all about who you know 
 It's all about who you know 
 When you get to the end and you've got nothing to show 
 It's all about who you know 
 It's all about who you know 
 You have learned how to pull strings 
 And call in a favor or two 
 You have found some ways to spend your time 
 Instead of with "you-know-who" 
 There's only one name 
 You can call on without blame 
 Some may wonder where, when if not how 
 There's no worry, if you know Him now 
 Nothing we do here below 
 Is gonna save us 'cause 
 It's all about who you know

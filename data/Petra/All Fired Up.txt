Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Psalm 104:4, Luke 3:6 
 When the weight of the world begins to show 
 When the flames of faith begin to die before I know 
 Time to be rekindled by the everlasting Source 
 The all Consuming Fire, illuminating Force 
 Like a blacksmith bellows aim 
 He fans the embers to a flame 
 I'm all fired up - I'm all fired up 
 There's a flame burning in my soul 
 And my heart is a burning coal 
 I'm all fired up - I'm all fired up 
 Those who wait up on the Lord 
 Find their strength has been restored 
 The flames of renewal burn within 
 I'm all charged up in my spirit again 
 I'm all fired up - I'm all fired up tonight 
 I've been told not to let my feelings go 
 I've been told my emotions never had the right to show 
 But I have this feeling burning deep within my heart 
 Won't wait to let this heavenly celebration start 
 When the Spirit gives me the nod 
 I'll get excited 'bout the things of God 
 I feel my faith renewing - I feel revival brewing 
 All over the world there's a burning desire 
 I feel the Church is stirring and it's gonna keep occurring 
 Till we're all baptized in His Holy Fire

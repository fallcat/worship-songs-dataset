All over me, all over me 
 I've got the blood of an innocent man 
 All over me 
 He never did anything to hurt anyone 
 But He said something bout being God's own Son 
 Some people believed Him, some people received Him 
 Some people wouldn't stop till they saw Him die 
 Like an innocent lamb He was taken away 
 He never opened His mouth He had nothing to say 
 He just let them accuse Him, He just let them abuse Him 
 And the people wouldn't stop till they saw Him die 
 They nailed His hands and His feet to the wood 
 At the foot of His cross all His enemies stood 
 He said "Father forgive them" - He gave them all He could give them 
 Then He gave up His life and they watched Him die 
 They laid His body in a rich man's tomb 
 But He rose from the dead and He's coming back soon 
 You can choose to believe it, you can choose to receive it 
 You can choose to believe that He did over you

It's an age-old score that's got to be settled 
 It's an age-old debt that's got o be paid 
 Hen the King breaks trhough in all of His glory 
 To claim His throne on the world that He made 
 The nations wait with their armies gathered 
 With Jerusalem firmly under their thumbs 
 There will be no peace in Armageddon Valley 
 Till the trumpet sounds and the cavalry comes 
 When He arrives, He will conqure them all 
 Take back the ground given after the fall 
 All the King's horses and all the King's men 
 Gonna ride down from heaven from where they've been 
 All the King's horses and all the King's men 
 Gonna put this world back together again 
 Gonna put this wrld back together... 
 On a great white horse, the King will come ridin' 
 He's the One they call Faithful and True 
 With His eyes of fire and blood-dripped clothing 
 He had a name nobody else knew 
 And by His side ride the armies of heaven 
 Dressed in linens clean and white as the snow 
 Riding down to earth with a vengeance so holy 
 For the one-day battle that will crumple their foe 
 And when the dust and the smoke disappears 
 The King will reign for a thousand years 
 All the King's horses and allthe King's men 
 Gonna put this world back together again 
 Gonna put this world back together again 
 When the lion lays down with the lamb 
 There'll be peace in the Land of Abraham 
 They will beat their swords into plows 
 When ever tongue will confess, and every knee bows

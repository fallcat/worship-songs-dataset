Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Matthew 6:5,16, James 4:6 
 I can tell by the look on your face 
 It's another day of fasting 
 I can tell by the length of the shadow 
 That your face is casting 
 And you look both ways before you pray 
 Just to see who's watching you today 
 It's just your altar ego - and it's so hard to know 
 Beneath the piety and hidden vanity begins to show 
 It's just your altar ego - and you don't even know 
 And you won't even grow till His Spirit strikes a bow 
 To your altar ego 
 You love to seen by men 
 In all the public places 
 And you always pick the best of the seats 
 You've got the social graces 
 Can you be so proud of respect you've won 
 When your left hand knows what the irght has done 
 Turn around and face the One 
 Who knows your heart 
 He knows your heart

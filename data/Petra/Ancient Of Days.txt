Blessing and honor 
 Glory and power 
 Be unto the Ancient of Days 
 From every nation 
 All of creation 
 Bow before the Ancient of Days 
 Every tongue in heaven and earth 
 Shall declare Your glory 
 Every knee will bow at Your throne 
 In worship 
 You will be exalted, oh God 
 And Your kingdom will not pass away 
 Oh, Ancient of Days 
 Blessing and honor 
 Glory and power 
 Be unto the Ancient of Days 
 From every nation 
 All of creation 
 Bow before the Ancient of Days 
 Every tongue in heaven and earth 
 Shall declare Your glory 
 Every knee will bow at Your throne 
 In worship 
 You will be exalted, oh God 
 And Your kingdom will not pass away 
 Oh, Ancient of Days 
 Blessing and honour 
 Glory and power 
 Be unto the Ancient of Days...

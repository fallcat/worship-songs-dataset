City lights are flashing, they call you to the streets 
 Hearts are filled with passion in everyone you meet 
 The Boulevard is waiting, it wants to get you high 
 Neon signs are waiting to sell you anything you want to buy 
 But I know your devices, it shouldn't seem so odd 
 You lied from the beginning, I see through your facade 
 Angel of light, I see you glow in the night 
 But you only bring darkness to my soul 
 Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right 
 I won't let you're evil take control 
 They follow in your footsteps not knowing that you fell 
 Bumper to bumper on the freeway to hell 
 You lead them into wrong and you make it look so right 
 You lead them into darkness and make them think you lead them into light 
 But I know where you're going, too bad you're not alone 
 If it wasn't for the real light I might have never known 
 Angel of light, I see you glow in the night 
 But you only bring darkness to my soul 
 Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right 
 I won't let you're evil take control 
 You got the clergy working overtime to widen the narrow way 
 You've got politicians everywhere listening to what you say 
 You've got false apostles teaching lies perverting the only way 
 You've got principalities and powers waiting to obey 
 You've got philosophies and vain deceits lying to deceive 
 You've got hate, and greed, ungodly lusts in the deadly web you weave 
 Somehow you've got so many thinking you're not even there 
 One look is all it takes to get them blinded by your glare 
 Angel of light, I see you glow in the night 
 But you only bring darkness to my soul 
 Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right 
 I won't let you're evil take control

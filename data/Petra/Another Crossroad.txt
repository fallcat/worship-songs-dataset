Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Psalm 119:105, Proverbs 10:30 
 Another day of indecision - there's a battle in my head 
 It's not a matter of submission - I'll go where I'm led 
 But my mind keeps changing every day 
 I need your peace to point the way 
 And now I'm at another crossroad 
 And I don't know which way to go 
 My steps are ordered and I know I'll find the way 
 When your Word lights the path and I obey 
 When your Word lights the path and I obey 
 Sometimes I feel a hesitation - is it me or is it You 
 I only need some kind of clue - I just need an indication 
 It's not hard to miss a turn along the way 
 I know I've missed some in my day 
 I don't want to be wrong 
 I want to do what's right 
 I know that you can lead me through the maze 
 When I acknowledge you in all my ways

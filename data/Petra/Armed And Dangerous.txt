It used to be a distant call 
 Thought to be for some but never all 
 Now our wounded lay on every side 
 Now this call to arms can't be denied 
 The enemy will tremble 
 As young and old assemble 
 A mighty army up in arms 
 Armed and dangerous 
 God's enemies will scatter 
 Armed and dangerous 
 We'll see the darkness shatter 
 His armor is worth its weight 
 No weapon can penetrate 
 Armed and dangerous 
 We're ready to storm the gate 
 We're not so tough on our own 
 Not one can even stand all alone 
 Just a rag tag army at its best 
 We sometimes even fail the smallest test 
 But through this tribulation 
 There comes a transformation 
 We don the armor of our King 
 Stand! 
 Up against the flood 
 Stand! 
 Covered by his blood 
 We are the standard he has raised 
 Stand! 
 Earnestly contend 
 Stand! 
 To the very end 
 We've only just begun to fight

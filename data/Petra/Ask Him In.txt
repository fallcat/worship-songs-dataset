Now that you've heard the music 
 Where do you go from here 
 You see music only takes you to the place 
 Where you're ready to hear 
 We could sing and tell you we love you 
 And you could say it wasn't true 
 But how can you say that about a man 
 Who died for you 
 Jesus is holding out His love to you 
 But He made it so that you have to choose 
 How can you walk away empty again 
 When you know that you've got nothing to lose 
 You could probably think of a reason 
 To wait until another day 
 But the spirit is speaking, telling you 
 Today is the day 
 Jesus gave His life as a ransom 
 Was crucified and laid in a grave 
 But He rose again and made a new way 
 For man to be saved

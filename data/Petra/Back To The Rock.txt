Back to the Rock that is higher than I 
 Take me to the well that will never run dry 
 Take me, take me, Lord 
 To the Rock that is higher than I 
 There was a man who built his house upon the sinking sand 
 When the wind and rain came, it washed it all away 
 There was another man who learned to watch and pray 
 And he built his house upon a rock of Jesus and it still stands today 
 Take me to the Rock 
 To the Rock of my salvation 
 Take me to the Rock 
 To the well for every nation 
 Take me to the Rock 
 Everyone who hears the voice of Jesus and obeys 
 Is like the man who built his house upon the rock that stands 
 It was the Son of Man who gave us this command 
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, your mind, your strength

Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Matthew 28:19, 22:9 
 It's so easy to lose the burden - Take our eyes off the fields 
 Settle into apathy and forget what the harvest yields 
 It's so easy to think we're finished with our labor for awhile 
 Kick back and let somebody else go the extra mile 
 Jesus said Go (Go!) into all the world 
 Make disciples of all men 
 We gotta Go (Go!) to the highways and compel them to come in 
 As long as there's a tearful eye that cries alone at night 
 As long as there's a weary soul ready to end the fight 
 As long as there's an aching heart that still has strength to beat 
 We gotta take this message back to the street 
 We gotta take this message back to the street 
 It's so easy to stay untangled in everyone else's life 
 Don't get involved with strangers - don't get involved with strife 
 It's so easy to save your own life - resting on what you've done 
 But Jesus would leave the ninety nine to try to save the one 
 It's not easy to beat the system 
 It's not easy to face the heat 
 But somebody's got to take this message 
 Back to the street

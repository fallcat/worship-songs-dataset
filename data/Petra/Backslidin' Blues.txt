Please tell me what makes me feel this way 
 I've been down to the bottom and I don't want to stay 
 Tell me what can I do 
 To get back to You? 
 I got the blues 
 Those backslidin' blues 
 I can see it, I've been on the wrong road 
 And I'm too tired to carry such a heavy load 
 Satan's marking me now 
 I can't take it no more 
 I got the blues 
 Those backslidin' blues 
 Have mercy, take me back once again 
 I'll never be perfect and I sure haven't been 
 I know that you will 
 But you know that until 
 I got the blues 
 Those blackslidin' blues

Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Peace be unto you 
 My peace I give to you 
 In this world you'll surely find 
 Trials of many different kinds, but 
 Be of good cheer 
 Be of good cheer 
 For I have overcome this world 
 Be of good cheer 
 Be of good cheer 
 For now I go away 
 But I will return 
 To take you to a place to dwell 
 So where I am you'll be as well 
 In this world you'll surely find 
 Trials of many different kinds 
 But I will not forsake you then 
 I'll be with you until the end

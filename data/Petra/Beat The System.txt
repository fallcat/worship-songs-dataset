Caught in the undertow being swept downstream 
 Going against the flow seems like such a dream 
 Trying to hold your ground when you start to slide 
 Pressure to compromise comes from every side 
 Wise up, rise up 
 You can be more than a conqueror, you will never face defeat 
 You can dare to win by losing all, you can face the heat - dare to 
 Beat the System 
 On the assembly line trying to break the mold 
 Time to throw the wrench that will stop it cold 
 Going against the odds being the underdog 
 Dare to wield the sword that will slice the fog 
 You can go for it all 
 You can go for broke 
 You can turn the tide around 
 You can aim for the top 
 And take the lion's share 
 If you dare to hold your ground

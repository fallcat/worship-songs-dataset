Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 1 John 3:18 
 On his journey we begin at birth 
 This fleeting moment that we spend on earth 
 No second chance to live it all again 
 It must be now or never 
 To cherish each endeavor 
 What will they say that I have left behind 
 A faithful heritage for all to find 
 What will the see? 
 I want my legacy to be 
 He was a believer in deed 
 He had a heart of a different breed 
 He made his mark and he lived by his creed 
 A true believer 
 A believer in deed 
 Am I living everything I say? 
 Am I pointing others to the way? 
 Will I leave this world a better place? 
 Will Jesus say he knew me 
 Is Jesus living through me? 
 Did I maintain my authenticity? 
 A man of honor and integrity? 
 Remembering me 
 I hope that they will truly see 
 At the end of my days I know I'm gonna say 
 I wouldn't live my life any other way 
 I'll look to my posterity to carry on for me 
 And pray that they will see

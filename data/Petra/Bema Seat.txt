When our labor all retire 
 There will be a trial by fire 
 Will your treasure pass the test 
 Or will it burn up with the rest 
 You may build upon a sure foundation 
 With your building in dilapidation 
 When it all comes down to rubble 
 Will it be wood, hay, or stubble 
 Or precious stones, gold and silver- 
 Are you really sure? 
 And we all will stand at the Bema Seat 
 All will be revealed - it will be complete 
 Will there be reward in the fiery heat 
 When we see our lives at the Bema Seat 
 Every talent will be sure counted 
 Every word will have to be accounted 
 Not a story will be left untold 
 We will stand watch the truth unfold 
 Every score - will be evened - nothing to defend 
 Every building will be shaken 
 Every motive will be tried 
 He'll give reward to the faithful 
 Will you receive or be denied?

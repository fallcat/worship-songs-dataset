How lovely is your dwelling place 
 O Lord Almighty 
 For my soul longs and even faints for you 
 For here my heart is satisfied 
 Within your presence 
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings 
 Better is one day in your courts 
 Better is one day in your house 
 Better is one day in your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 One thing I ask and I would seek 
 To see your beauty 
 To find you in the place your glory dwells 
 My heart and flesh cry out 
 For you, the living God 
 Your spirit's water to my soul 
 I've tasted and I've seen 
 Come once again to me 
 I will draw near to you 
 I will draw near to you

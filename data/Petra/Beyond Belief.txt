We're content to pitch our tent 
 When the glory's evident 
 Seldom do we know 
 The glory came and went 
 Moving can seem dangerous 
 In this stranger's pilgrimage 
 Knowing that you can't stand still 
 You cross the bridge 
 There's a higher place to go 
 Beyond belief, beyond belief 
 Where we reach the next plateau 
 Beyond belief, beyond belief 
 And from faith to faith we grow 
 Towards the center of the flow 
 Where He beckons us to go 
 Beyond belief, beyond belief 
 Leap of faith without a net 
 Makes us want to hitch our bed 
 Waters never part 
 Until our feet get wet, whoa, whoa 
 There's a deeper place to go 
 Where the road seems hard to hoe 
 He who has begun this work 
 Won't let it go (let it go!) 
 And it takes so long to see the change 
 But we look around, and it seems so strange 
 We hav come so far, but the journey's long 
 And we once were weak, but now we are strong

Don't know where you're going but you think you know the way 
 20-20 vision but you can't see the light of day 
 Road is wide or narrow but you can't tell which is which 
 Blind will follow blind and you'll both end up in the ditch 
 Can't you see you can't see? Don't you know - you don't know? 
 Blinded eyes can't see the light 
 When it's glowing in the night right in front of you 
 Blinded eyes can't see the truth 
 When it's written on the wall in plain view 
 Blinded eyes can't see the Son 
 Or the work that He has done out of love for you 
 Blinded eyes 
 Groping in the darkness searching for the missing switch 
 Come up empty-handed try to scratch the endless itch 
 There is only one light that can penetrate your mind 
 Just one look at Jesus could leave their scales behind 
 Can't you see - you could see? Don't you know - you could know?

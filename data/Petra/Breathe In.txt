Words and music by Pete Orta 
 When the rain was coming down on my face 
 Your love was the sun that I embraced 
 All the things in my heart for so long 
 Need to fall in the sea of forever gone 
 When there's days I could really fall in 
 It's in the dark you may see your only friend 
 So visit me in my castle of sand 
 Fill the walls with your presence once again 
 You can hear me and I can feel you when 
 I close my eyes and I dream 
 Of the day you'll come for me 
 I close my eyes and I dream 
 But until the day, I need your love to set me free 
 I want you to breathe into me 
 Living life is what I want out of me 
 To capture love and then to set it free 
 So give me wings and I'm out of here 
 To set in flight all the things you made so clear 
 I've walked the line between love and fear 
 And took the time to know life is sheer 
 Take me with you 
 It moves too fast, oh this world I'm in 
 To face the past, lets me rest again 
 I'll take you with me

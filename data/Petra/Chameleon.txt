You want the best of both worlds 
 You're not getting either 
 You seem content to ride the fence 
 When you know which side is greener 
 Some run hot, some run cold 
 Some run from their maker 
 Some run the risk of losing out 
 With lukewarm friends and fakers 
 Chameleon 
 You blend with your surroundings 
 Chameleon 
 No one knows where you come from 
 Chameleon 
 You change with every situation 
 Compromising dedication 
 You compromise each word you say so innoffensively 
 You only want to hide behind your anonymity 
 You struggle for acceptance 
 And it takes you to extremes 
 The smile you hide your face behind 
 Is not all that it seems 
 Come out, come out 
 Come out from among them 
 Come out, come out 
 Come out and be free 
 There is no gray, no neutral ground 
 There's only black and white 
 And nothing in between the two 
 To turn a wrong into right 
 There is no time for your charade 
 You've got to make your stand 
 When salt has lost its savor 
 The world becomes so bland

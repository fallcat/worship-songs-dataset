You might see me stumble, you may see might fall 
 You might see me cornered with my back against the wall 
 Maybe incognito, maybe out to lunch 
 Maybe caught red-handed or maybe just a hunch 
 I'm clean, clean, clean before my Lord 
 I'm clean, clean, clean before my Lord 
 Like a spotless lamb, I'm blameless in His sight 
 With no trace of wrong left to right 
 I'm clean, clean, clean 
 Kneeling in the closet begging daily bread 
 There may be a skeleton hanging overhead 
 Where are my accusers, nowhere to be found 
 They all dropped their stones when the Master came around 
 I've missed the mark I can't deny it 
 I don't condone or justify it 
 But I've done nothing that His blood can't wash away 
 When I take it to the cross and start to pray

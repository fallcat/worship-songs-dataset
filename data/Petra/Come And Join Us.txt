We are like stones built together in a wall 
 Made up of whosoever the Master Builder calls 
 We are not worthy but together we are strong 
 Built on the Rock of Ages the wall is almost done 
 Come and join us in the sunlight 
 You've been sittin' in the shade too long 
 Come and give us a chance to sing you a song 
 Come and join us in the sunlight 
 If you would reach you could touch the sky 
 Come and drink from the well that will never run dry 
 We are like stranger and pilgrims in this world 
 Lifting the blood stained banner our flag has been unfurled 
 We have a homeland no eyes have ever seen 
 But those who've gone before us whose souls have been redeemed 
 We are like children held in the Father's hand 
 Growing into the image of Christ the Son of Man 
 We are not perfect but changing every day 
 Through trials and tribulation we'll find the perfect way

Everything that you do and see, one more event in your memory 
 Every bit takes another bite without control over wrong or right 
 You must screen every entry made, the consequences must be weighed 
 The only way to security is every thought in captivity 
 Computer brains, put garbage in 
 Computer brains, get garbage out 
 Computer brains, programming you 
 Computer brains, what can you do? 
 Break out 
 Are you a user or being used, has your memory been abused? 
 Take random samples from your mind and analyze what you may find 
 You can clear all your memory and be transformed when you find the key 
 Think on the things that will bring you peace, confusing data soon will cease

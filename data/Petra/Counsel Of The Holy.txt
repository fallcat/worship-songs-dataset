There is a light burning in the darkness 
 A book of Hope 
 A morning light 
 Breaking over the mountains 
 To where the eagle flies 
 It gives us wings to touch the sky 
 It is the wisdom of the wise 
 Counsel of the Holy 
 The written Word of God 
 Wisdom cries for all to read 
 Counsel of the Holy 
 The greatest book of all 
 Is the path of victory 
 A book of wonder 
 A book of life 
 A book of promise faithful and true 
 A book of miracles for all who will believe 
 A book of wisdom to all who will receive 
 The counsel of the Holy 
 The written Word of God 
 Wisdom cries for all to read 
 The counsel of the Holy 
 The greatest book of all 
 Is the path of civtory 
 Wisdom cries for all to read 
 Wisdom cries for all to read 
 More precious than rubies 
 More precious than gold 
 Mighty is the wisdom of the Lord

I believe in God the Father, maker of heaven and earth. 
 And in Jesus Christ His only son, I believe in the virgin birth. 
 I believe in the Man of Sorrows, bruised for iniquities. 
 I believe in the lamb who was crucified, and hung between two thieves. 
 I believe in the resurrection, on the third and glorious day 
 I believe in the empty tomb, and the stone that the angel rolled away 
 He descended and set the captives free 
 And now He sits at God's right hand and prepares a place for me 
 This is my creed 
 The witness I have heard 
 The faith that has endured 
 This truth is assured 
 Through the darkest ages past 
 Though persecuted it will last 
 And I will hold steadfast 
 To this creed 
 I believe He sent His spirit, to comfort and to reveal 
 To lead us into truth and light, to baptize and to seal 
 I believe He will come back, the way He went away and... 
 Receive us all unto Himself but no man know that day 
 This is my creed 
 The witness I have heard 
 The faith that has endured 
 This truth is assured 
 Through the darkest ages past 
 Though persecuted it will last 
 And I will hold steadfast 
 To this creed 
 I believe He is the judge, of all things small and great 
 The resurrected souls of men, receive from Him their fate 
 Some to death and some to life, some to their reward 
 Some to sing eternal praise, forever to the Lord 
 And through the darkest ages past 
 Though persecuted it will last 
 And I will hold steadfast 
 To this creed 
 ...This creed... whoa... whoa... my creed... whoa

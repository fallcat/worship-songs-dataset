I've been to the party and I left alone 
 And I've danced with a few that I'd be better off on my own 
 I've been to the altar and I know I kneeled 
 But I ended up dancing in the grass of another field 
 Then someone told me I heard someone say 
 Dance with the one who brung ya 
 Dance with the one you know who got you there 
 Dance with the one who brung ya 
 Don't change hats, you know it's the one you wear 
 My feet start moving down inside my shoes 
 But I don't want to settle for the beat of a lonely blues 
 And there's no use dancin' to a different drum 
 When I've seen what happens and I know what will become 
 I can testify it's never worth a try 
 I looked high, I looked low 
 You're never gonna find someone who loves you so 
 Stand tall, stand strong 
 You're only gonna see you're right where you belong 
 Don't try to fix what has never been broke

It's a new day at last, but you're sinking so fast 
 If left up to your head, you'd remember the past 
 But a new day has come and new life has begun 
 Let the old pass away, reconsider it done 
 There's got to be a reckoning 
 When you feel the Spirit beckoning 
 It's a dead reckoning 
 Trade the old for the new 
 It's a dead reckoning 
 Learn to die daily till the new life comes through 
 It's a dead reckoning 
 You've got nothing to lose but you do have to choose 
 When the Spirit says yes but the flesh wil lrefuse 
 And although you feel odd there are many who trod 
 Till they're dead to the world but alive unto God 
 Some still believe it can't be done 
 To the steady the race is still won 
 And the battle is already through 
 And it's hard to believe but it's true 
 On a hill long ago where the blood runs below 
 Died a King, two thieves, and you

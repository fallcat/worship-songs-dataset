We need Your deep love to keep us strong 
 We need Your truth to show us right from wrong 
 We need Your sweet peace to keep us calm 
 We need Your comfort to show us we belong to You 
 Sometimes we're like a river 
 Always running from our Source 
 But when we wonder why we're almost runnin' dry 
 You restore us and return us to our course 
 Sometimes we get so desperate 
 Straying further from the fold 
 But when it seems that we're losing all our dreams 
 There's a Shepherd with a loving hand to hold 
 Forgive us Lord 
 For thinking we can make it without You in this world 
 We're so foolish 
 Sometimes we're like a fortress 
 With our walls built all around 
 But then Your love comes shining down from above 
 And we stand and watch our walls come tumbling down

You used to play their games 
 You used to stay the same 
 They used to hold you back 
 They knew the best attack 
 They thought they had a better hold on you 
 They thought that you would always stay true blue 
 They couldn't stop you - they had no defense 
 You went under the wire - you went over the fence 
 Defector - you broke the chains away 
 Defector - a higher power you obey 
 Now they have no hold on you - you've broken through 
 But don't forget to read the signs 'cause 
 You still live behind - enemy lines 
 Defector 
 They used to drag you down 
 They used to have you bound 
 Just like a ball and chain 
 But they could not restrain 
 They thought that you could never break away 
 They thought that you would always go their way 
 They had you tied up habitually 
 They never figured you could ever get free 
 You got away clean but it don't come free 
 Another man paid with His on agony for... 
 Freedom 
 Freedom

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 8:28-30 
 Time is a gift on loan 
 Fate is already known 
 It's your destiny to make it to the end 
 It's your destiny to go against the trend 
 Heavenly destiny, destiny 
 Plans are already laid 
 Debts are already paid 
 It's your destiny, your place 
 Within His will 
 It's your destiny, you alone can fill 
 Heavenly destiny 
 When you gonna see you're meant to be 
 You're chosen out of history 
 No one else can take your place 
 The one and only in the human race 
 One of a kind 
 When you gonna see He has a will 
 For you and only you fulfill your destiny 
 The steps of a righteous man 
 Are led by a Master's plan 
 It's your destiny, don't forsake the call 
 It's your destiny, a stone within the wall 
 It's your destiny, no accidental call 
 It's your destiny, you were meant to be 
 It's your destiny, only you can see 
 Heavenly destiny

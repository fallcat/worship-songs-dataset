Love flowing around me 
 A new found peace inside 
 I've made a decision 
 And now I'm satisfied 
 Jesus told me to follow 
 And to count the cost I'm willing to pay 
 I know I'm not worthy 
 And I know it's not the easiest way 
 I just want to be 
 I just want to be 
 I just want to be His disciple 
 I lived a delusion 
 With no one else to blame 
 I found a solution 
 When I called on His name 
 I may not have money or riches 
 But I found something better to be 
 To be a servant of Jesus 
 He means more than the world to me 
 The fields are ready for harvest 
 But the laborers are few 
 I just want to be where the Lord can use me 
 And work until the day is through 
 All of my life I've been searching 
 For the person who hides in me 
 I finally found someone 
 Who could make me who I want to be 
 I can't wait to see Him 
 Just want to hear Him say 
 "Well done faithful servant 
 Enter into joy today"

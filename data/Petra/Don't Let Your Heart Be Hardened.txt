Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Psalm 95:7-8, Hebrews 3:13 
 Don't let your heart be hardened - don't let your love grow cold 
 May it always stay so childlike - may it never grow too old 
 Don't let your heart be hardened - may you always know the cure 
 Keep it broken before Jesus, keep it thankful, meek, and pure 
 May it always feel compassion - may it beat as one with God's 
 May it never be contrary - may it never be at odds 
 May it always be forgiving - may it never know conceit 
 May it always be encouraged - may it never know defeat 
 May your heart be always open - never satisfied with right 
 May your heat be filled with courage and strengthened with all might 
 Let His love rain down upon you 
 Breaking up your fallow ground 
 Let it lossen all the binding 
 Till only tenderness is found

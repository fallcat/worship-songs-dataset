Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Hebrews 10:19,20 
 Once a year for sacrifice just one priest could pay the price 
 And step inside the inner veil to make the people free 
 Temple stood the same for years till the Nazarene appears 
 Things will never be the same since 33 A.D. 
 When He spoke and bowed His head 
 He who saved the world was dead 
 Then the earth began to shake 
 Heaven's wall began to break 
 Opening the Holy Place 
 The temple veil is torn in two 
 The way is clear for me and you 
 [We] can enter in, enter in 
 Into Heaven's Holy place 
 We can enter in, enter in 
 Boldly by His blood we can approach His throne of grace 
 We can enter in a new and living Way 
 By our faith He will receive us when we pray 
 Enter in 
 Now without a second look we forget what all it took 
 To be seen as innocent by His Holy eyes 
 Never thinking foolishly there is something He won't see 
 For our lack of righteousness there is no disguise 
 He won't look the other Way 
 Someone's life will have to pay 
 Once for all it has been done 
 Taken out upon His Son 
 He remembers it no more 
 Now for us He is the Door 
 Opened up forevermore 
 We can enter in, enter in 
 Into Heaven's Holy place 
 We can enter in, enter in 
 We can enter in His gates with thankfulness and praise 
 We can enter in, enter in 
 Into the once forbidden Holy place 
 We can enter in, enter in 
 We can live in goodness and in mercy all our days 
 We can enter in a new and living Way 
 By our faith He will receive us when we pray 
 We don't have to be afraid to seek His face 
 We can enter in

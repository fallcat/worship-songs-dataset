Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Psalm 37:23-24 
 Standing on the corner I was losing track of time 
 When away in the distance saw an old friend of mine 
 He was smiling when he walked up held a tract out in his hand 
 Then he told me Jesus loved me and said "so do I, man" 
 Told me Jesus wants to save me from the fiery pit of hell 
 Then I told him I was livin' there I knew that place well 
 I was just about to leave when a love came over me 
 Like nothin' I had felt then we kneeled and we prayed 
 Right there in the street we prayed 
 And now, after all those years of falling down 
 I fell up in the arms of love 
 When I heard Him call 
 (Love was calling I was falling) 
 He was there and I could hear Him callin' 
 I was fallin' up into His arms 
 Love was catchin' me that day and somehow 
 I was fallin' up then 
 And I'm fallin' up now 
 I'm fallin' up now 
 I remember that same feeling I'm reminded everyday 
 See, Jesus lives inside me and I know He's there to stay 
 Sometimes I start to fall down just like any other man 
 But His arms are there to catch me 
 And lift me up again 
 After all those years of falling down 
 I fell up in the arms of love 
 When I heard Him call 
 Now - couldn't live without Him 
 Now - wanna know more about Him 
 Now - I'm falling once again 
 Now - falling up to heaven

Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 You made the sun to light the day 
 You made the moon to light the night 
 You made me your son to light the world 
 But I still need more of Your light 
 Father of lights shine down on me 
 In all the dark places I'll never see 
 Only your light can take the night from me 
 There is no shadow under You 
 There is no place darkness has to hide 
 So search me and show me where You've never been 
 Help me let Your light inside 
 So let it shine, shine, shine 
 And it will chase away the darkness 
 Let it shine, shine, shine 
 And it will chase away the night 
 Just when I think there is no more darkness 
 Just when I think I've seen all Your light 
 You show me a corner I've kept from You 
 My fear and pride keeps it out of sight

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Revelation 2:9, 1 John 4:19, Song of Solomon 2:4 
 Sometimes I feel I'm pulled in so many wrong directions 
 Sometimes I feel the world seducing my affections 
 It's not that I don't know the way 
 It's just a heart that's prone to stray 
 But with my weaknesses admitted 
 You will keep all that I've committed 
 So I commit my heart to You 
 My First Love 
 First Love - First Love 
 My soul longs after You 
 First Love - First Love 
 I want my heart to stay so true 
 Because You first loved me 
 Jesus You will always be 
 You will always be 
 My First Love 
 It's taken me some time to try to comprehend 
 A love that doesn't change - a love without an end 
 A love that keeps forgiving 
 A love of sacrifice and giving 
 I delight myself in You 
 My First Love 
 If I ever lack endurance 
 I remember Your assurance 
 That Your only banner over me is love 
 If my heart begins to waiver 
 Woo me back, my loving Savior 
 Woo me back till I return to my First Love

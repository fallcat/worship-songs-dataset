Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 1 Corinthians 1:21-25, Revelation 21:18 
 Some say this life is only foolishness 
 No waiting pot of gold in the faith that I possess 
 But the treasures of this life will slowly turn to dust 
 And this fool will find His gold in the Savior that I trust 
 Fool's gold - it's waiting in a crown 
 Fool's gold - in a city coming down 
 I'll leave the gold I can't afford 
 For the higher prize I'm pressing toward 
 I'll preach the foolish cross of Christ 
 And wait for my reward 
 Fool's gold 
 The wisdom of the cross - is easy to receive 
 But only foolishness - to them that don't believe 
 They may say that I'm a fool for the cross that I proclaim 
 But the gold that I must seek won't be found in earthly fame 
 When the crowns of gold all lay before His feet 
 Then the worthy Lamb of God is the treasure we will keep 
 Some may call me foolish - some may call me odd 
 But I'd rather be a fool in the eyes of men 
 Than a fool in the eyes of God

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Music by Jim Cooper 
 Hold on to life for all you're worth 
 You know He died for all you're worth 
 He loves you 
 You have the greatest value 
 He gave His life for all 
 For all you're worth 
 By this time you know the story 
 There's nothing there you haven't heard 
 You can cross the line of knowing 
 And your heart believing His Word 
 Do you think He brought you this far 
 Just to leave you wondering where and who you are 
 Just think back to where it began 
 Jesus called you name and then you just took His hand 
 Even gold still needs refining 
 Burning off impurities 
 Even diamonds grow in value 
 When they're cut so carefully 
 There's no life beyond His repair 
 You will find Him waiting just beyond a prayer 
 He invested all that He had 
 Don't you think it hurts Him inside to see you sad 
 He has His eye on you 
 You have the greatest value 
 He gave His life for all 
 For all you're worth 
 For all you're worth

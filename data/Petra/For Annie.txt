No one ever noticed Annie weeping 
 People all around, but she was all alone 
 Mama's got her meetings, Daddy's got his job 
 And no one's got the time so Annie's on her own 
 No one ever knew her desperation 
 People couldn't hear her cry out silently 
 Locked inside the bathroom she grabs a jar of pills 
 The medicine that cures becomes the poison that kills 
 And it's too late for Annie, she's gone away for good 
 There's so much we could tell her and now we wish we could 
 But it's too late, it's too late for Annie 
 Sadness fills the hearts of Annie's family 
 Daddy tries to comfort Mama uselessly 
 They hoped she knew they loved her, but they really didn't know 
 They just want to know why did their baby go 
 (2nd Chorus) 
 And it's too late for Annie, she's gone away for good 
 There's so much we could tell her and now we wish we could 
 We would tell her Jesus loves her, tell her Jesus cares 
 Tell her He can free her and her burdens bear 
 But it's too late, it's too late for Annie 
 If only we had known her situation, 
 We'd have tried to stop this useless tragedy 
 Annie's lost forever, never to be found 
 But there are lots of others like her all around 
 (3rd Chorus) 
 And it's not too late for Annie, she could be next to you 
 Don't miss the chance to tell her before her life is through 
 We gotta tell her Jesus loves her, tell her Jesus cares 
 Tell her He can free her and her burdens bear 
 Tell her Jesus loves her, tell her Jesus cares 
 Tell her He can free her and her burdens bear 
 You've got to tell her Jesus loves her, tell her Jesus cares 
 Tell her He can free her and her burdens bear 
 It's not too late

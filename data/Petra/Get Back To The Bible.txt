I don't know what I've been told 
 Joe Smith has seen Moroni 
 It's getting so a man can't tell 
 Who's real and who's a phony 
 Get back to the Bible 
 It's telling you the way to go 
 Jesus is the answer to everything you need to know 
 "Hare Krishna" may be fun to sing 
 But it ain't gonna get you to heaven 
 The only one who's gonna get you there 
 His number is a perfect seven 
 Get back to the Bible 
 It's telling you the way to go 
 Jesus is the answer to everything you need to know 
 Satan worship may be cool and hip 
 But when are you gonna learn? 
 There's a place that's set for you and him 
 Man, you know you're gonna burn 
 So get back to the Bible 
 It's telling you the way to go 
 Jesus is the answer to everything you need to know

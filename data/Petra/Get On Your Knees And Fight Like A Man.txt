Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 2 Chronicles 10:4, James 5:16 
 Out on your own with your own self reliance 
 You've got no one to watch your back 
 You find yourself caught with no strong alliance 
 You've been left open for attack 
 Over your head the condition is graver 
 You've given ground you can't retrieve 
 The cards are stacked and they're not in your favor 
 But you've got an ace up your sleeve 
 Get on your knees and fight like a man 
 You'll pull down strongholds if you just believe you can 
 Your enemy will tuck his tail and flee 
 Get on your knees and fight like a man 
 Under the gun, you've got no place to hide out 
 Backed in the corner on your own 
 This is one storm you are destined to ride out 
 One way to leave the danger zone 
 Get on your knees and fight like a man 
 You'll pull down strongholds if you just believe you can 
 Your enemy will tuck his tail and flee 
 Get on your knees and fight like a man 
 You've got the backbone to fight this tide 
 You've got the will to survive 
 You've got the weapon, it's at your side 
 You've got to learn to confide 
 Get on your knees and fight like a man 
 You'll pull down strongholds if you just believe you can 
 Your enemy will tuck his tail and flee 
 Get on your knees and fight like a man

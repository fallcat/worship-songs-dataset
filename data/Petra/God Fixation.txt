He's got a straight head 
 In a world of brain dead 
 He's got a clean nose 
 Even when the wind blows 
 He's got a backbone even when he's all alone 
 Ain't taken no chances following the masses 
 He's got his mind set 
 On high with his affections 
 He's got the jones 
 He makes no bones 
 It's a God fixation 
 A singleness of heart, an undistracted mind 
 It's a God fixation 
 Addiction of a different kind 
 He's got 20/20 vision making a decision 
 He's so unaffected by what he has rejected 
 Rooted and grounded - 
 He's standin' up to be counted 
 And he's already proved 
 That he will not be moved 
 He will not bend to 
 The pressures and persuasions 
 He knows the lies 
 He won't compromise 
 Fascinations 
 In the heavenlies 
 Imaginations 
 In captivity

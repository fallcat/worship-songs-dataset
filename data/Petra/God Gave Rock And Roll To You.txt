God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you 
 Put it in the soul of everyone. 
 God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you 
 Put it in the soul of everyone. 
 You can learn to dance 
 Or you can be a square 
 You can let the music take you anywhere 
 But where will you be when the music's gone? 
 You can learn to sing 
 You can play guitar 
 You can learn to rock 
 You can be a star 
 But where will you be when the music's gone? 
 If you love the sound 
 Then don't forget the source 
 You can turn around, 
 You can change your course, 
 'Cause it's never too late to change your mind. 
 You can love the rock 
 And let Him free your soul 
 Or you can let the old man take his toll 
 It's never too late to change your mind.

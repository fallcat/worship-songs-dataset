God is my refuge, 
 God is my strength, 
 He's my very present 
 Help in the time of need. 
 He is my hope; 
 He's the source of all I seek, 
 Nothing can compare to 
 All he's done for me (2x) 
 He's the rock that I hold 
 To in the storm 
 And in the pouring rain. 
 Through the night 
 And through the day, 
 What more can I do 
 What more can I say? 
 Ending 
 Nothing can compare, nothing can compare, nothing can compare to you.

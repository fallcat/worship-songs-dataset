So many voices telling me which way to go 
 So many choices come from those who think they know 
 There's a way that seems right to a man 
 But it only brings him death 
 I wanna go the way that leads to life 
 Till I draw my dying breath 
 Don't wanna be a manpleaser - I wanna be a Godpleaser 
 I just want to have the wisdom to discern the two apart 
 Don't wanna be a manpleaser - I wanna be a Godpleaser 
 I just want to do the things that please the Father's heart 
 Some make a sacrifice and never let it show 
 Some make a point of letting everybody know 
 Some will live their lives as unto men 
 And they have their reward 
 I just wanna do everything I do 
 With all my heart unto the Lord 
 I just want my life to glorify His Son 
 To make my Father proud that I'm His child before I'm done 
 No need to pat me on the back or stop the shake my hand 
 I just want to hear my Father say "Well done, well done" 
 I just want to hear my Father say "Well done"

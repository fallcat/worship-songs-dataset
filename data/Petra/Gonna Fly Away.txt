Dreamin' about flyin' since I was a boy 
 Never thought I'd see the real mccoy 
 I think it's safe to say 
 I finally found a way 
 Gonna fly away 
 Gonna fly away 
 Every day I've been looking in the sky 
 Hope it's not raining when I start to fly 
 I bet you think I'm strange 
 Wait until I'm changed 
 Gonna fly away 
 Gonna fly away 
 Where you gonna be when the trumpet blows? 
 All that's left of me is gonna be my clothes 
 I'd really like to see 
 You flyin' next to me 
 Gonna fly away 
 Gonna fly away

Words and musicby Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 10:15 
 It's just the same thing every day 
 It's only bad news coming my way 
 Another war, there's a film at eleven 
 Another crime from the heart of man 
 I can sit here with my lock on the door 
 Change the channel as I try to ignore 
 Or get ready with shoes on my feet 
 And start dancing to another beat 
 Good news - you can read all about it 
 Good news - speak the word, never doubt it 
 Good news- 'cause we can't live without it 
 I got good news on a long-standing offer 
 Life you can never lose 
 Some people can't see the light of day 
 They need somebody to show them the way 
 They climb the walls in fear of the future 
 But God alone has the only cure 
 The world is spinning like it's out of control 
 There's only one thing that can save the soul 
 I'm feeling today is the day 
 So listen up, I've got something to say 
 All this bad news is getting me down 
 Got my head spinning around 
 Don't have to take it, you know you can choose 
 So listen up... I've got some good news 
 The world needs to hear good news of the love of God's Son 
 Every life can be changed by the hearing of what He's done

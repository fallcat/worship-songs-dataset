There's a step that we all take alone 
 An appointment we have with the great unknown 
 Like a vapor this life is just waiting to pass 
 Like the flowers that fade, like the withering grass 
 But life seems so long and death so complete 
 And the grave an impossible potion to cheat 
 But there's One who has been there and still lives to tell 
 There is One who has been through both Heaven and hell 
 And the grave will come up empty-handed the day 
 Jesus will come and steal us away 
 Where is the sting, tell me where is the bite 
 When the grave robber comes like a thief in the night 
 Where is the victory, where is the prize 
 When the grave robber comes 
 And death finally dies 
 Many still mourn and many still weep 
 For those that they love who have fallen asleep 
 But we have this hope though our hearts may still ache 
 Just one shout from above and they all will awake 
 And in the reunion of joy we will see 
 Death will be swallowed in sweet victory 
 When the last enemy is done from the dust will come a song 
 Those asleep will be awakened - not a one will be forsaken 
 He shall wipe away our tears - He will steal away our fears 
 There will be no sad tomorrow - there will be no pain and sorrow

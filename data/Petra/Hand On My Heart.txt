Got Your hand on my heart and 
 I won't walk away 
 Got a hold of my life and I'm here to stay 
 Got Your hand on my heart 
 I remember when You first touched my heart 
 And the seed of life within began its start 
 Now I've finally found security 
 Now I finally see I'm Yours eternally 
 You've got Your hand on me 
 Got Your hand on my heart and 
 I won't walk away 
 Got a hold of my life and 
 I'm here to stay 
 Got Your hand on my heart 
 And now I know 
 That You won't let me go 
 You're never gonna let me go 
 I don't want to lose another day 
 Feeling You're a million miles away 
 I just want to know without a doubt 
 I will always feel Your loving hand is reaching out 
 I feel Your touch every night, every day 
 With Your hand on my pulse 
 I won't easily stray 
 But if I ever do, a gentle tug will pull me through 
 I just have to let You know 
 That I love You so

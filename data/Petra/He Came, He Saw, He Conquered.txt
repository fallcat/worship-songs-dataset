Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Genesis 3:15, Matthew 28:6, John 20:19, Revelation 6:2 
 He came alone into the battle 
 He knew nobody else could face His foe 
 He left His throne, He left His glory 
 He knew nobody else could ever go 
 He called the bluff, He took the challenge 
 He came into this world to seek and save 
 No one could know, no one could fathom 
 The way to win was only through the grave 
 They laid Him in His tomb 
 They thought they'd sealed His doom 
 But He rose 
 He rose! 
 He came, He saw, He conquered death and hell 
 He came, He saw, He is alive and well 
 He was, He is, and only He forgives 
 He died, He rose, He lives 
 He came, He saw, He conquered! 
 The doors were locked, they heard Him knocking 
 They were afraid they would be taken, too 
 Familiar voice said, "Come and follow" 
 Come and see the things the Lord can do 
 They went to where He lay 
 The stone was rolled away 
 He rose 
 He rose! 
 He came into this world 
 He saw humanity 
 He heard the SOS 
 He met the enemy 
 The enemy was conquered 
 The enemy was conquered!

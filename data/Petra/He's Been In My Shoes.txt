Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Hebrews 2:18, 4:15 
 Here in my hour of need 
 I'm lonely, forsaken again 
 I'm wounded and left here to bleed 
 With no solace from a stranger or friend 
 Who hears my cry to revive and restore? 
 One who has been here before 
 He's been in my shoes 
 Been down this road before 
 He's been tested, too 
 He's been through this door 
 He feels the pain and He heals the bruise 
 He's been in my shoes 
 He's been in my shoes 
 The union of God in a man 
 Is a mystery that I can't understand 
 And now with my suffering known 
 I'm reminded that I'm never alone 
 Who has been tried and been tempted this way? 
 Jesus who now hears me pray 
 He was a man just like me 
 But He lived His life blamelessly 
 Now I'm beginning to see 
 He holds my hand 
 He understands

Words by Brian Wooten 
 Based on Psalm 31:24 
 The fearless giant faced a brave young shepherd boy 
 He said, "Your God is dead and your nation soon destroyed" 
 But the son of Jesse proved what God can do in the heart of a hero 
 Three men refused to bow to the idol made of gold 
 They knew they could burn for not doing what they're told 
 They'd rather face the fire than to kneel to a god made by hands 
 It takes the heart of a hero 
 To stand for what's right 
 It takes the heart of a hero 
 To lay down your life 
 There are idols to be worshipped and giants in the land 
 They'll drag you down, attack your faith and slay you if they can 
 So let your heart be filled with the courage and strength of the Lord 
 Have the faith of a child 
 And the power of God 
 And when you call on His name 
 He will give you the heart of a hero 
 Will you stand for what's right? 
 Would you lay down your life? 
 Do you have heart?

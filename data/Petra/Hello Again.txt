Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Revelation 21:4 
 Everybody has to say their goodbyes 
 While they wipe away the tears from their eyes 
 Everybody bids a fonder farewell 
 When they know there won't be any sequel 
 Everybody says a Sayonara 
 When they know they won't be back tomorrow 
 Everybody hopes to have reunions 
 Back together with the ones they knew once 
 There's a salutation that's reserved for heaven's own 
 Hello again- we're back together 
 Hello again- we're here forever 
 Hello again- rejoined in heaven 
 Hello again 
 Everybody's gonna be there waiting 
 They just want to see you graduating 
 Gonna see the ones who've gone before us 
 They'll be cheering in a mighty chorus 
 Everybody will be glad to see ya 
 Even if it wasn't their idea 
 Every argument will be forgotten 
 We remember them for now but not then 
 When we see each other there'll be just one thing to say... 
 Say goodbye to the loneliness forever (Never be alone) 
 Say hello to the garden once again 
 Say goodbye to this world of stormy weather 
 Say hello to the One who calls you "friend" 
 I can't wait until we're reunited and we say...

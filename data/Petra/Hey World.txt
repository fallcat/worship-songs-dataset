Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Jeremiah 1:5, Acts 17:25 
 It could have gone either way when it came down to the choice 
 To keep the life within a life that had no voice 
 It must have surely seemed the harder road to choose 
 To be so young to have to say who had the most to lose 
 But she came through like a champ and she blessed the world that day 
 Then gave the hope of a better life when she gave him away 
 Now the innocence and joy is there each day he wakes 
 Expressions of his love of life in every breath he takes 
 He could have been thrown away before he had a chance to say 
 Hey world, I am here and I have something to give 
 Hey world, I'm alive and I am wanting to live 
 He turned to lock the door as he wiped away a tear 
 The hopelessness of missing love, his adolescent fear 
 As he struggled for the strength to put the gun away 
 He found the courage and the hope to face another day 
 He could have been blown away before he had a chance to say 
 Down the corridor or life in between our death and birth 
 We may start to lose our way in the search to find our worth 
 Our value comes in the fact we live 
 Life is a gift only God can give

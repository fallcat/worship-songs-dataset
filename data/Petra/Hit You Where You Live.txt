Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 1 Timothy 4:12, Ephesians 4:1 
 You want to change - with all of your might 
 You want to do right in His sight 
 It's His delight to give you your desire 
 It's His desire to set your life on fire 
 Sometimes it hurts when reprimanded 
 It hurts Him more than it's hurting you 
 He'll pick you up from where you landed 
 When He knocks you down, turns your life around 
 He'll turn your life around 
 Hit you where you live you can't hold it back 
 When you're struck by His love you will know 
 Hit you where you live, it's so close to home 
 When you're all sold out the mark will show 
 Let Him hit you where you live 
 The evidence leads to conviction 
 When we don't live everything we say 
 There's got to be a crucifixion 
 We can live dying everyday 
 You've got to tell Him He's free to take a shot 
 He wants to hit you with everything He's got 
 A lost and dying world is dying to know 
 He lives 
 The only way they'll know what He has to give 
 Is when we're hit where we live

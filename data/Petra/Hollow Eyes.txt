Another day in Nigeria the children beg for bread, 
 The crops failed, the well ran dry 
 When they lost the watershed 
 A baby dies, its mother cries, the children gather 'round 
 They're wondering what the day will bring 
 Will they be the next one found? 
 Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
 Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes, 
 Hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
 In the crowded sheds the children lay their heads 
 To escape the Haitian heat 
 The hunger pains drive them to the street 
 Wond'ring if today they'll eat 
 Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease 
 Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease. 
 The least of these is hungry. 
 The least of these is sick. 
 The least of these needs clothing. 
 The least of these needs drink. 
 The least of these knows sorrow. 
 The least of these knows grief. 
 The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name. 
 (2nd Chorus) 
 Do you dare to gaze into His hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
 Is He staring back at you with His hollow eyes, 
 Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?

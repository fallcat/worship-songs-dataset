Everybody's talking about power 
 Power to the people they say 
 Everybody tryin' to get more power 
 They're goin' in circles today 
 I'm sick of this jive, gonna hop in my rod 
 Gonna motivate clear across town 
 Gonna go to church, gonna end my search 
 Gonna fill my soul with power 
 Holy Ghost power gonna fill you today 
 Holy Ghost power gonna take you away 
 Holy Ghost power gonna fill you within 
 Holy Ghost power gonna save you from sin 
 Don't give me no jive, you ain't even alive 
 Till you get your heart right with God 
 Better ask Him in and forget your sin 
 Let Him fill your soul with power

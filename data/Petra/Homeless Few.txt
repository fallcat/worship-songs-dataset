Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Luke 10:30-37, 1 John 3:17 
 Where are the amber waves of grain 
 When one of our homeless native sons has hunger pain 
 Under the overpass they build a fire for heat 
 They can't remember when they had a meal to eat 
 Some sleep in doorways waiting for the day 
 Some sleep in boxes we have thrown away 
 Under the red, white and blue 
 Right down the street in our view 
 We're not doing all we can do 
 To shelter the homeless few 
 Shelter the homeless few 
 Standing in line for soup and bread 
 Hoping tonight the downtown mission has a bed 
 Dreaming about the home they thought they'd never lose 
 Sleeping on benches covered by the daily news 
 People who pass them by just turn their heads 
 Making them feel like they've been left for dead 
 Under the red, white and blue 
 Right down the street from our pew 
 We're not doing all we can do 
 To shelter the homeless few 
 Shelter the homeless few 
 It's up to me 
 It's up to you 
 We're not doing all we can do 
 To shelter the homeless few 
 Shelter the homeless few

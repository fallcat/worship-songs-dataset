Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Matthews 9:37-38, Romans 12:1 
 I don't have much to offer you, I don't have much to give 
 There's so much I may never be as long as I may live 
 I may never be all I want to be although I'll always try 
 But if you choose me, to use me, there's just one reason why 
 I am available, I am available 
 I will go when you say go 
 I am available, I am available 
 I will stop when you say no 
 My whole life was incomplete till I laid it at Your feet 
 So use me as You will 
 I am available 
 I'm not the most dependable - sometimes you can't rely 
 There's no excuse, there's no defense, there's only one reply 
 I know that my ability is not Your main concern 
 It's my availability and willingness to learn

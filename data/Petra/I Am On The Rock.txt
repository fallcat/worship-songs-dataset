The earth is shakin' 
 It's like a bad dream 
 This world is crumblin' 
 Comin' apart at the seam, 
 But I am on the Rock, I am on the Rock 
 Everywhere I'm turning 
 It's only bad news 
 This bomb is tickin' 
 And we're getting to the end of the fuse, 
 But I am on the Rock, I am on the Rock 
 Are you ready? 
 I am on the Rock, the sure foundation 
 I am on the Rock, on the Rock/I am on the Rock/the Rock of Jesus 
 I am on the Rock, His revelation 
 I am on the Rock. 
 Though the winds may blow 
 And though the floods may grow 
 I shall not be moved, 'cause I am on the Rock 
 The storm's approaching, 
 I'm standing high and dry 
 Firmly planted 
 On the Rock that is higher than I, 
 I am on the Rock, I am on the Rock 
 Kingdoms failing, 
 They fall around me 
 Plans eroded 
 And washing away to the sea, 
 I am on the Rock, I am on the Rock 
 Are you ready? 
 There is no Rock in this world but our God!

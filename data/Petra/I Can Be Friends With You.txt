I can be friends with you 
 There's no better friend that a man can know 
 I can be friends with you 
 And I feel so special 
 'Cause it's you I know 
 I don't know the governor 
 Even though I'm a resident 
 I don't rub shoulders with the dignities 
 Or shake hands with the President 
 And I know I can be with you 
 And I don't have to wait in line 
 You're the author and creator of all the world 
 And a personal friend of mine 
 When I have a problem 
 I can always come to You 
 Regardless of the situation 
 I know You know what to do 
 You put Your arm around and speak so tenderly 
 And I feel better just to know You care 
 And you took the time for me 
 Greater love has no man than this 
 That a man lay his life down for his friend 
 But You laid down for all the world to see 
 And You proved Your love for me 
 I'm no special person 
 I've got nothing to offer You 
 But You treat me like I'm the only one 
 With whom you have to do 
 You're closer than a brother 
 And You're with me every day 
 I love You 'cause You first loved me 
 And I'm glad that I can say

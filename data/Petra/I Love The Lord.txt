Words by Bob Hartman 
 Well I don't care what some may say 
 Gonna stand up for the Lord today 
 Well I don't care if they all know 
 Gonna let the Lord's redeemed say so 
 Gonna say it loud - gonna say it proud 
 Hey! I, I love the Lord 
 I, I love the Lord 
 Come join the throng - ten million strong 
 Come lift your voice and sing this victory song 
 Gotta choose today whom you will serve 
 Don't try to wait to find the nerve 
 The lines are drawn - no middle ground 
 Don't you know you're either lost or found

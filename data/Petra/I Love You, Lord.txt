I love you, Lord 
 And I lift my voice 
 To worship You 
 Oh, my soul rejoice! 
 Take joy my King 
 In what You hear 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear 
 I love you, Lord 
 And I lift my voice 
 To worship You 
 Oh, my soul rejoice! 
 Take joy my King 
 In what You hear 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear 
 I love you, Lord...

I've been away for a little while 
 And I don't like where it takes me 
 Out of touch I'm going out of my mind 
 It's times like these that really break me 
 So here I am all alone 
 I'm waiting on You 
 Just a word will get me through 
 I need to hear from You 
 Before this night is through 
 I need to hear from You 
 So I'm waiting, waiting just to hear from you 
 My whole world is turning upside down 
 When I'm lacking in direction 
 I don't care if it takes all night 
 I need to feel Your sweet affection 
 So let me hear words of life 
 I'm lost without You 
 Speak to me the way You do 
 I've been here in this place before 
 And You're not the one to blame 
 I need to know what You have in store 
 So I'm on my knees callin' out Your name 
 I need to hear from You 
 Deep inside my heart 
 I need to hear from You 
 Just a still small voice is gonna get me through

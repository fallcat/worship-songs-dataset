I waited 
 For the Lord on high 
 I waited 
 And He heard my cry 
 He pulled me out of my despair 
 He taught me how to walk 
 From fear into security 
 From quicksand to the Rock 
 I sing to let the people know 
 That I have been restored 
 And they will kneel and understand 
 To return and trust in the Lord 
 And there's a new song 
 In my heart to sing 
 There's a new song 
 Praises for my King 
 I waited.

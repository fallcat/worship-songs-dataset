Living water - I am thirsty and dry 
 Bread of heaven - only You satisfy 
 I am waiting for Your comfort and peace 
 Come and fill me, let this emptiness cease 
 I will seek You 
 I will find You 
 I will follow what I know is true 
 I will seek You 
 Like I used to 
 I will worship You 
 You are holy, You are a wonder to me 
 In creation I see Your majesty 
 Speak to me and I will listen 
 (Give me the call and point the way) 
 Lead me on and I will follow 
 (Hearing Your Word I will obey)

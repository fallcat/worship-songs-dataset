I see the chill of autumn's wind 
 Seasons changing once again 
 Every moment pass 
 Until one moment less we spent 
 But together my friend 
 I can't hold back these tears in my eyes 
 This time I won't even try 
 Time has come and gone 
 Now we must move on 
 I'll admit I don't know why 
 Now we must say good-bye 
 To find out road ahead 
 Destiny leads us on to another place 
 And I'll meet you there someday 
 We chase the future into past 
 Only to find that it never last 
 By the time it's gone 
 The pain is so strong 
 And yet, I'll be missing my friend 
 Though we lost what was before 
 Forever will bring us the chance once more 
 In that time we'll see what was meant to be 
 A special moment to cherish for all of our lives 
 And we'll know we've come 
 Now we must say good-bye 
 To find out road ahead 
 Destiny leads us on to another place 
 And I'll meet you there someday 
 From a life we all leave behind 
 We'll find there's much more ahead 
 Father will lead us on to a better place 
 And I'll meet you there someday 
 I'll meet you there someday 
 I'll meet you there someday

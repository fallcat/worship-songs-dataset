I'm not ashamed to say I need you 
 You satisfy my every need 
 And when I yield to You and give my love You always set me free 
 I'm not ashamed to talk about You 
 You given me a love You share 
 I know you died and rose and will return to meet us in the air 
 I'm not ashamed, I've been forgiven 
 I have no need to run and hide 
 And when You take my hand I know that there's to be afraid 
 I'm not ashamed to say I love You 
 And I know You first loved me 
 And when I hear Your voice, it keeps me hanging on to what I've got

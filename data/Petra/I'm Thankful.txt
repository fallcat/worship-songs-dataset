Jesus, I'm thankful for your love 
 And it's been you I've been thinking of 
 I've got a home in heaven above 
 You gave me my life when I was losing, I was choosing my own way 
 And with a miracle you changed me, rearranging me each day 
 Now I'm so thankful for your presence taking residence within 
 You've given me that sweet assurance of endurance to the end 
 Jesus, I'm thankful for your love 
 And it's been you I've been thinking of 
 I've got a home in heaven above 
 Father, I'm thankful I'm your son 
 And I believe you're the only one 
 Who could have forgiven all that I've done 
 Sometimes we forget the victory's won 
 Taking for granted what you've done 
 Forgetting to thank you for your Son 
 Now every day I know you're with me to assist me in the fight 
 And I know my life will not be hollow when I follow in your light

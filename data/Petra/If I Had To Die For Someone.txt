John 15:13 
 Words and Music by Bob Hartman 
 I wear my seatbelt in the car I buckle up for safety 
 I run for cover from the storm 
 I wear a band aid on my knee I look both ways when crossing and I flee 
 Any danger I can see 
 And if I try each day to save my life in every way I can 
 How could I understand the way 
 You died for me 
 'Cause I don't know if I could even if I think I would 
 If I had to die for someone 
 If I had to die for someone else 
 How could I ever give my life to set the guilty free 
 When I cannot imagine 
 If I had to die for someone else like me 
 Someone else like me 
 I keep away from falling rocks and I don't play with matches 
 I lock the door I don't know why 
 It seems to me I'm much too old to wear a scarf out in the cold but 
 I want to live until I die 
 I guess I love my life a little more than I should love it 
 And if I had to I don't know if I could 
 Lay it down 
 And I am glad that You are not at all like me 
 'Cause You laid down Your life and did it willingly 
 It still amazes me to know 
 It's me that You were thinking of 
 No One else could have a greater love

Words and music by John Lawry and John Elefante 
 Based on Psalm 17:15 
 In the likeness of You 
 Recreated, renewed 
 Let me awake forever 
 In the likeness 
 In the likeness of You 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 My heart and soul are Yours to keep 
 I close my eyes and try to see 
 More of You and less of me 
 Jesus, I'm trusting in You 
 So while I'm sleeping 
 Keep me dreaming 
 Of when I will awake 
 In the likeness of You 
 Recreated, renewed 
 Resurrected by Your righteousness 
 In Your likeness 
 In the likeness of You 
 Men dream of fortune and fame 
 Making the rules, naming the game 
 And men dream of things they can hold 
 Money and power, silver and gold 
 Jesus, I'm dreaming of You 
 Take me and melt me, mold me 
 Until I am complete 
 In the likeness of You 
 Recreated, renewed 
 Resurrected by Your righteousness 
 In the likeness of You 
 In the likeness of You 
 So faithful and true 
 Let me awake forever in the likeness of You 
 The likeness of You 
 I want to be 
 I want to be like You 
 In all I say 
 In all I do

In the heat of the early morning 
 On a hill they call the Skull 
 The roaring of the angry mob had settled to a lull 
 All eyes were cast upon the man whose hands and feet were bound 
 They saw him cry in anguish when they heard the hammer pound 
 They saw the bloody woven thorns with which His head was crowned 
 They watched the bloody cross of wood be dropped into the ground 
 The soldiers gambled for His clothes, they watched them win and lose 
 They saw the sign above His head that said "King of the Jews" 
 (It is finished) And the sky grew black as the night 
 (It is finished) And the people scattered in fright 
 The work had been done, redemption had been won 
 The war was over without a fight 
 It is finished 
 They searched His face for anger, for vengeance in His stare 
 Instead of eyes that burned with hate a look of love was there 
 He prayed for their forgiveness and bowed His battered head 
 And no one knew the meaning of the final words He said 
 The provision has been made 
 The foundation has been laid 
 He paid the ransom due and tore the temple veil in two 
 And opened up the way for me and you 
 It is finishe

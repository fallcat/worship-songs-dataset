By Bob Hartman 
 Based on Rom. 7:15 
 I have a secret that I let nobody see 
 An evil shadow that's been hanging over me 
 My alter ego that I try to hold at bay 
 But despite my good intentions he can always get away 
 He does the things that I don't want to do 
 Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde 
 Two men are fighting a war inside 
 I have this secret that I let nobody see 
 It's like a split personality 
 And the one I feed is the one who lives 
 The one I starve will be the one who gives 
 He won't do things that I know I should do 
 Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde 
 Two men are fighting a war inside 
 One gives, one takes, I have to decide 
 Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde 
 I need somebody to rescue me 
 When personalities clash 
 I know which person I want to be 
 With no defiance 
 Just God-reliance

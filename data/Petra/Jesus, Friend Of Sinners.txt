There is a voice that must be heard 
 There is a song that must be sung 
 There is a name that must be lifted high 
 There is a treasure more than gold 
 There is a king upon the throne 
 There is one whose praise will fill the skies 
 His name is Jesus, friend of sinners 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Friend of mine 
 There is a peace that calms our fears 
 There is a love stronger than death 
 There is a hope that goes beyond the grave 
 There is a friend who won't let go 
 There is a heart that beats for you 
 There is one name by which we are saved 
 When I was captive to my fears 
 You were the one who came to me 
 You set me free 
 You set me free

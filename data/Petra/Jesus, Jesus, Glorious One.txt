Words and music by Curtis Peifer 
 Let all the saintly ones in God rejoice 
 The battle's won so lift your voice 
 Declare His Name the glorious King 
 Lift up the standard of triumph and sing 
 Crown Him Lord the conqueror of evil 
 He shed His blood to redeem all His people 
 And now we join the procession of Him 
 To hail Him Lord and glorious King 
 Jesus, Jesus, glorious One 
 Jesus, Jesus, God's risen Son 
 Jesus, Jesus, forever we'll sing 
 Jesus, Jesus, we'll hail you as King

Based on Luke 22:47, 48 
 (Backwards message): 
 What are ya looking for the devil for 
 When ya oughta be looking for the Lord?! 
 I wonder how it makes you feel when the prodigal won't come home 
 I wonder how it makes you feel when he'd rather be on his own 
 I wonder what it's like for you when a lamb has gone astray 
 I wonder what it's like for you when your children disobey 
 It must be like another thorn struck in your brow 
 It must be like another close friend's broken vow 
 It must be like another nail right through your wrist 
 It must be just like 
 Just like Judas' kiss 
 I wonder how it makes you feel when no one seeks your face 
 I wonder how it makes you feel when they give up in the race 
 I wonder what it's like for you when they willingly disobey 
 I wonder what it's like for you when they willingly walk away

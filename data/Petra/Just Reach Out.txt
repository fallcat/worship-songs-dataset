Words and music by John Schlitt and Rick Gotee 
 Based on Psalm 34:16-18, Romans 10:9-13 
 Sometimes the night seems to go on for days 
 When it's hard to see the light through the darkness and haze 
 While the world around you makes you feel out of place 
 And the burdens that you carry are just too hard to face 
 Just reach out and He'll reach in 
 Take your broken heart and make it whole again 
 It don't matter who you are or where you've been 
 Just reach out, and He'll reach in 
 Standing in a crowd, but still all alone 
 Crying out for answers that nobody knows 
 Everybody's busy looking out for themselves 
 Is there anyone who really cares about anyone else? 
 You say you've walked ten thousand steps away 
 But don't you know that it's only one step back? 
 Because the One who hears you when you pray 
 Is the One who's there beside you 
 And He'll never walk away

Kenaniah 
 Words by Bob Hartman, John Lawry, and Danny Kingen 
 Based on 1 Chronicles 15:22,27 
 Kenaniah of the Levites appointed by the king 
 To teach the songs of Zion, to lead them as they sing 
 Your song is not forgotten, we hear it in our souls 
 Let it burn and burn within us 
 And fan the sacred coals 
 Kenaniah, Kenaniah, we will sing your ancient song 
 Kenaniah, Kenaniah, we will sing it loud and strong 
 Gathered for the battle, Kenaniah led the way 
 As the singers closely followed him, they all began to pray 
 The musicians all assembled, Kenaniah gave the word 
 Through the raging battle zone, the anthem could be heard 
 Kenaniah, Kenaniah, we will never let it die 
 Kenaniah, Kenaniah, we must lift it to the sky 
 Sing unto Jehovah of His wondrous ways 
 Sing a song of triumph, sing a victory song 
 And in the cloud of witnesses, Kenaniah sings along 
 Kenaniah, Kenaniah, through the ages it will ring 
 Kenaniah, Kenaniah, to Jehovah we will sing

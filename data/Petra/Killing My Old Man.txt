I think it's gone far enough 
 I can't take it anymore 
 I've got to even up the score 
 Before he sweeps me off the floor 
 I've really got to find a way 
 Of taking care of him for good 
 I know he'd kill me if he could 
 So I'll nail him to the wood 
 Killing my old man 
 You may not understand 
 He's a terrible man 
 Got to make a stand 
 And kill the old man 
 Every time that I think he's gone and I've finally won 
 He just keeps coming back, puts me on the run 
 I think I'd better do it now 
 Get my hammer and a nail 
 Pray to God I that I won't fail 
 Lest he'll keep me in the jail 
 And I don't wanna stay in jail!

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Matthew 20:28 
 It's such a paradox - it's such a mystery 
 Why a King would leave His throne to save humanity 
 They could not have known when they mocked Him in disgrace 
 They could not have known when they spit upon His face 
 The Rose of Sharon wore a crown of thorns that day 
 The carpenter had a nail right through His hand 
 The Master of the earth became a servant of no worth 
 And paid a King's ransom for my soul 
 He paid a King's ransom for my soul 
 Creator of the earth - Name above all names 
 Some just stood in unbelief when listening to His claims 
 They could not have known when they hit Him with their fists 
 They could not have known when they nailed his feet and wrists 
 The ransom that He paid was the sacrifice he made 
 The life of a King in place of me 
 The shame that He bore for the rich and for the poor 
 Changed His crown of thorns into glory

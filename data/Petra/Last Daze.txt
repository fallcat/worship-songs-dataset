Somewhere in the darkest night a stranger 
 Has lost the way 
 Cold wind and a distant light has carried his heart away 
 Some say he was one of us, a prodigal gone astray 
 But inside he's as cold as ice to the truth that 
 He won't obey 
 He won't discern- the point of no return 
 In the last daze- the final haze 
 There was strong delusion to believe a lie 
 In the last daze before the blaze 
 They couldn't see beyond their misty trance 
 To grab the truth and have fighting chance 
 In the last daze 
 Cold chills when the Spirit speaks that some shall 
 Depart from the faith 
 All ends in calamity just when they thought it was safe 
 They followed the lies- the fables men devised 
 Some say it's a certainty, a sign of the times I am told 
 But I weep for the souls of those who will never return 
 To the fold

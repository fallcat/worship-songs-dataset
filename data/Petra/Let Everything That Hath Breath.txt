Let everything that has breath praise the Lord 
 Let every creature under God's sun praise the Lord 
 Let all the mountains, let all the valleys 
 Let all the hillsides sing of His glory 
 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord 
 Israel had a war to fight but the Lord showed them the secret 
 He said the battle this day is mine, but you must listen how to do it 
 Put your singers first in front of the rest 
 Let them praise and sing to me 
 And you will see the salvation of your God 
 And watch your enemies flee 
 Paul and Silas were thrown in jail 
 For preaching the gospel of Christ 
 Though in chains they praised His name singing songs in the night 
 Just then an earthquake shook the place and the chains and the doors were loosened 
 Then the jailer ran in scared to death and that day he found salvation

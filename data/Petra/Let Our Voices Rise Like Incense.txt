Let our voices rise like incense 
 Let them be as sweet perfume 
 Let our praises fill the temple 
 Hallelujah's ringing ever new 
 Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord Almighty 
 Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord our God 
 Let our voices rise like incense 
 Let them be as sweet perfume 
 Let our praises fill the temple 
 Hallelujah's ringing ever new 
 Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord Almighty 
 Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord our God 
 Holy, Holy 
 Is the Lord our God

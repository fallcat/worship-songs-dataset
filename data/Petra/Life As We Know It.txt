First He calls out 
 Into your darkness 
 He woos you gently 
 And you have to choose 
 But the choice is easy 
 It's light and darkness 
 There's an invitation 
 You can not refuse 
 Revelation - when you see where you've been 
 Confirmation - you've been born again 
 This is life as we know it 
 Forgiven and free 
 Life as we know it 
 More abundantly 
 Born of the Son, we can finally see 
 This is life as we know it 
 Undeniably 
 One day doubting 
 You're walking blindly 
 Through shadow's darkness 
 You don't feel a thing 
 But you keep on walking 
 Though you sometimes stumble 
 Till you find assurance 
 Only faith can bring 
 Never perfect, but perfectly forgiven 
 Finding courage to get up again 
 Bent, but not broken 
 Tempted, not shaken 
 Kept in the shadow of His wing 
 Held by the power 
 Sealed with the promise 
 By the One who is over everything

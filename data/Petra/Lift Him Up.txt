The world is looking for a revelation 
 We're always under their investigation 
 They look at us to hear we got to say 
 They can't see Jesus when we stand in the way 
 They don't need no more eleveated speeches 
 We're keeping Jesus just beyond their reaches 
 Can't see the forest for all of the trees 
 They won't see Jesus till we fall on our knees 
 Lift Him up higher and higher 
 Lift Him up set the world on fire 
 It doesn't take much theology 
 Just lift Him up so the world can see 
 Lift Him up tell the gospel story 
 Lift Him up left them see His glory 
 It doesn't take any Bible degree 
 Just lift Him up so the world can see 
 Sometimes they just can't see beyond the haze 
 Or find their way through the religious maze 
 Just like Zaccheus they're trying to see 
 They got to somehow see beyond you and me 
 Oh - how the world needs to see him 
 So they can believe Him 
 Oh - how can we ever hide Him 
 As if we had denied Him 
 Oh - How could He ever draw them 
 If they never saw Him 
 Oh - How can they see His glory 
 Without you and me

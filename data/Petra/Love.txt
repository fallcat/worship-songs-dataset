Love is patient, love is kind 
 No eyes of envy, true love is blind 
 Love is humble, it knows no pride 
 No selfish motive hidden inside 
 Love is gentle, makes no demands 
 Despite all wrong, true love still stands 
 Love is holy, love is pure 
 It lasts forever, it will endure 
 Love knows when to let go 
 Love knows when to say no 
 Love grows in the light of the Son 
 And love shows the world that the Son of 
 Love has come 
 Love is loyal, believes the best 
 It loves the truth, love stands the test 
 Love is God sent in his Son 
 Love forgives all we have done 
 In this world where hatred seems to grow 
 True love goes against the flow 
 And becomes so hard to show 
 In this world where push turns to shove 
 We have strength to rise above 
 Through the power of His love 
 Lord, we need to know the power of Your love

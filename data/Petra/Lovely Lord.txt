You are filled with compassion and mercy and grace 
 With Your banner of love over me 
 I am longing to see You one day face to face 
 And to be with You endlessly 
 Lord, how lovely You are to me 
 Lovely Lord 
 You are all to me 
 Lovely Lord 
 Full of purity 
 Worthy of honor and majesty 
 Lord, how lovely You are to me 
 You are bright as the sunrise and fairest of all 
 Unto You all the glory will be 
 You are God of creation and Lord of my life 
 I will worship You faithfully 
 Lord, how lovely You are to me 
 We will worship the name of the Holiest One 
 We will worship Your excellency 
 We will give You the glory 
 For things You have done 
 And be thankfully eternally 
 Lord, how lovely You are to me 
 Lord, how lovely You are to me

Lucas McGraw, what's come over you? 
 We're beginnin' to think you're tetched 
 We heard you got religion 
 Ya ain't been 'round to see us much 
 Ya threw away your corncob pipe and your jug of moonshine brew 
 And we hear you ain't been doin' all those things you used to do 
 Lucas McGraw what's come over you? 
 You're shavin' every day 
 You ain't been chasin' women and you kissed your wife today 
 You went to church last Sunday and ya shook the preacher's hand 
 And they you been talkin' 'bout a home beyond this land 
 Lucas McGraw, what's come over you? 
 You never cuss no more 
 We hear you ain't been feudin', you hung your rifle by the door 
 Ya take a bath each Sunday, if you need it or not 
 And ya go to work on Monday even when it's hot 
 Lucas McGraw what's come over you? 
 We're beginnin' to think you're tetched 
 We hear ya got religion, ya ain't been 'round to see us much 
 But ya know we've all been wonderin' 
 If what you got just might be real 
 And all the while we're laughin' 
 Is it really God, is it really God 
 Is it really God you feel?

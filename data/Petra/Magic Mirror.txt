Magic mirror don't let me walk away without seeing who I am 
 Magic mirror don't let me see who I am and only walk away 
 I must have walked by you a thousand times before 
 I never noticed you were hanging on my door 
 But then you caught my eye and let me see myself 
 My legs were running with my shoes nailed to the shelf 
 When I saw you hanging there I had to stop and stare 
 'Cause every time I see a little more of me 
 Sometimes I don't know who's been looking back at me 
 If I'd look closer I know I would always see 
 Won't you reflect your light on me and I'll reflect on you 
 Let me really see just how I look to you 
 When I act too tall, you bring me down to size 
 And when I feel too small you show me all the lies I try to tell myself 
 How can I thank you for all you've done for me? 
 And now I'm watching and I see me grow in you 
 I know that I've got so much growing left to do 
 Please keep me in your light from morning until night 
 Until I finally come into the image of the Son

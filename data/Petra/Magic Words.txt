Say the magic words 
 I won't say the magic words to please you 
 'Cause you might decide to judge me 
 By what I say to you and not what I do 
 Hide behind my words 
 I won't hide behind my words carefully 
 'Cause I'd rather let you see me 
 For what I am and not what you hope that I'll be 
 "I want you to be free," 
 Jesus said that to me 
 Why should things that we say 
 Have to get in the way 
 Say the proper words 
 I won't say the proper words to belong 
 But I'll speak and then I'll listen 
 And let Jesus make the tie strong 
 Play the proper words 
 I won't play the proper words like a game 
 'Cause we'd better have in common 
 A lot more than words to call the body our name 
 Why can't we deal in spirit 
 Not empty words and phrases 
 That we've learned to recognize 
 But barely understand 
 Designed to reassure us 
 That if words are in their places 
 Than our hearts must be there too 
 We really must understand 
 Whoa! 
 That's not the way it should be 
 Say the magic words 
 Say the magic words 
 Don't say the magic words 
 Please don't say the magic words 
 Please don't 
 Please don't say the magic words 
 Say the magic words 
 Say the magic words

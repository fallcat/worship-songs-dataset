Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 2 Peter 2:20 
 There are things that look attractive 
 On the surface of despair 
 There are things that hold my interest when I really shouldn't 
 Care 
 I have felt intoxicated viewing 
 Pleasures from afar 
 But I've been illuminated when they're seen for what they are 
 Keep me ever closer 
 Save me from this strong seducing... 
 Magnet of the world 
 It reaches to my heart and pulls me 
 Magnet of the world 
 Wants to keep me far from You 
 If it wasn't for Your love that holds me 
 I would give in to the 
 Magnet of the world 
 When a compass pulled by magnetism points a different way 
 It's not hard to lose your bearings, it's not hard to go astray 
 Guide me with Your lighthouse 
 Keep me from the rocks and from this 
 When will I be free from this 
 The unfulfilling counterfeit 
 When will I learn to resist 
 The constant pull that does exist 
 Take me farther from this path 
 Of least resistance now 
 Will You show me how? 
 And if it wasn't for Your love 
 That holds me 
 I would give in to 
 The magnet of the world 
 It reaches to my heart and pulls me 
 Magnet of the world 
 Wants to keep me far from You 
 Magnet of the world 
 It reaches to my heart and pulls me 
 Magnet of the world 
 Magnet of the world...

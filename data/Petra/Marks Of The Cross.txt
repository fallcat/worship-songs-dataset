Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Matthew 10:39, Luke 9:62 
 These days shallow and feeble resolve abound 
 And true devotion and passionate fervor are seldom found 
 But there are those who often feel they're all alone 
 Those of whose identities are known 
 By the mark of the crucified Son 
 Praying, caring, loving, sharing 
 These are the marks of the cross 
 Giving, bearing, feeling, daring 
 To lay down your life on the line 
 Forgetting what you leave behind 
 And willing to suffer the loss 
 Of the marks of the cross 
 These days the search for detachment and solitude 
 Lead to retreating to fortresses no one would dare intrude 
 Then there are those whose restless burdens start to show 
 Those who unmistakably most know 
 There's no crown till we suffer the cross 
 All our identity rests in the knowledge 
 Of who we're created to be 
 We are His workmanship, made in His image 
 For all of creation to see 
 The marks of His pain and His glory

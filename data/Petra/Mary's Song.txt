Hold that blanket closer Mary dear 
 All the world waits with you for your day 
 But for now the wind is cold and it's drear 
 And Bethlehem's still so far away 
 Do you remember the way you felt back then? 
 Joy and wonder filled your soul and when 
 The angel slipped away 
 You knew your life would never be the same 
 And now you're travelling, travelling on a road to Bethlehem 
 Wandering thoughts fly away 
 If you knew the road that lay ahead of Him 
 Would you break down and cry? 
 Your child is born to die 
 Feel that hand of strength upon your own 
 A husband's love that guides along the way 
 And as his understanding has grown, 
 His hopes too are centered on that day 
 For do you remember the way he looked back then, 
 Pain and sorrow filled his eyes until when 
 The angel came to say 
 The Savior's birth was meant to be this way 
 Think back on that promise you received 
 For him in whom the prophets long believed 
 Now belongs to you, you've been chosen too 
 But He's the One Who's gonna shine 
 We call His name Jesus, Immanuel 
 He'll save His people from sin and hell 
 And of His kingdom there will be no end

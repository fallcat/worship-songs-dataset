"Only by Grace" words and music by Gerrit Gustafson 
 "To Him Who Sits on the Throne" words and music by Debbye Graafsma 
 "You Are Holy" words and music by Scott Wesley Brown 
 Only by grace can we enter 
 Only by grace can we stand 
 Not by our human endeavor 
 But by the blood of the Lamb 
 Into Your presence You call us 
 Call us to come 
 Into Your presence You draw us 
 And now by Your grace we come 
 We come 
 Now by Your grace we come 
 Lord, if You mark our transgressions 
 Who would stand? 
 But thanks to Your grace 
 We are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb 
 Only by grace can we enter 
 And now by Your grace we come 
 We come 
 Now by Your grace we come 
 To Him who sits on the throne 
 And unto the Lamb 
 To Him who sits on the throne 
 And unto the Lamb 
 Be blessing and honor 
 And glory and power forever 
 Be blessing and honor 
 And glory and power forever 
 You are Holy 
 Oh, Lord, so Holy 
 You are Holy 
 Oh, Lord, so Holy 
 What a privilege and an honor 
 To worship at Your throne 
 To be caught into Your presence 
 As Your own 
 You are Holy 
 Oh, Lord, so Holy 
 You are worthy 
 Oh, Lord, so worthy 
 You are faithful 
 Oh, Lord, so faithful 
 Be blessing and honor 
 And glory and power forever 
 Be blessing and honor 
 And glory and power forever...

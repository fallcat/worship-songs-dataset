Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Matthew 25:1-13 
 We wait since the day He ascended 
 He said He would come again 
 Some think it will be such a long time 
 Some they the know just when 
 We live like there's no tomorrow 
 We wait without lamps of oil 
 We watch for the midnight hour 
 The day we cease our toil 
 When the trumpet sounds and the bridegroom comes 
 The wedding's gonna be so royal 
 So we gotta keep staying loyal 
 'Cause our feet are gonna leave this soil 
 When we burn the midnight oil 
 When we burn the midnight oil 
 Some wait from the top of the mountain 
 Away from the world below 
 Some work while there's still a harvest 
 No rest when there's seed to sow 
 We go out to wait for the bridegroom 
 Some bring oil of readiness 
 Some lamps will be burned out waiting 
 Left out in their emptiness 
 Will our lamps be full at parousia? 
 When the bridegroom comes we will hear the call

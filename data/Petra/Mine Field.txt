Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Proverbs 3:6, 1 Peter 5:8, Matthew 16:24 
 Smell the burning powder? 
 There's danger in the air 
 A voice from deep inside is telling you, 'you must beware' 
 Then enemy is watching 
 Every step you take 
 To find his opportunity in every choice you make 
 And it's no game 
 When someone lives without His grace 
 And who's to blame 
 When it blows up in their face 
 It's a mine field - you'd better follow Him through 
 God knows the way - you'd better stick like glue 
 It's a mine field - better stay on His heels 
 'Cause the enemy kills and the enemy steals 
 So keep your head down and keep you eyes peeled 
 'Cause life is... 
 Life is a mine field 
 Think the grass is greener? 
 You'd better look around 
 Everywhere you look another casualty is found 
 The enemy is waiting 
 For you to start to run 
 Waiting like an itchy finger on a loaded gun 
 Some may feel 
 They can wander out too far 
 They may heal 
 But they may always wear the scar 
 Better leave the navigation to the One who knows the Way 
 He will bring illumination 
 He will light your path each day 
 It's a mine field - better watch where you tread 
 Step off the path and you could end up dead 
 It's a mine field - better stay on His heels 
 'Cause the enemy kills and the enemy steals 
 So keep your head down and keep your eyes peeled 
 'Cause life is... 
 Life is a mine field

You say you've been feeling weaker, weaker by the day 
 You say you can't make the joy of your salvation stay 
 But good things come to them that wait 
 Not to those who hesitate 
 So hurry up and wait upon the Lord 
 More power to ya 
 When you're standing on His word 
 When you're trusting with your whole heart in the message you have heard 
 More power to ya 
 When we're all in one accord 
 They that wait upon the Lord, they shall renew, they shall renew their strength 
 Jesus promised His disciples He'd give strength to them 
 Jesus told them all to tarry in Jerusalem 
 When they were all in one accord 
 The power of His Spirit poured 
 And they began to turn the world around 
 So be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might 
 Put on all His armor and fight the good fight 
 In all of our weakness, He becomes so strong 
 When He gives us the power and the strength to carry on

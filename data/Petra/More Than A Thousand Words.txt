Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 8:26 
 I saw Your picture hanging on the wall 
 Just an artist rendering that was all 
 The way You looked down in Your agony 
 Jogged my memory 
 And helped me to see 
 If a picture's worth a thousand words 
 Then it won't help me at all 
 Only words are never gonna say 
 What I feel for You today 
 More than a thousand words won't say 
 More than my life will not repay 
 More than a thousand things I do 
 Won't make it up to You 
 I stopped a moment sitting all alone 
 Without a waiting call on the phone 
 Looked like a picture from a magazine 
 More serenity than I've ever seen 
 And if words cannot describe this day 
 Or the beauty of this scene 
 Tell me, how can I expect the words I say 
 To reflect the things I mean 
 More than a thousand words won't tell 
 How You forgave me when I fell 
 More than a thousand words won't do 
 To say I love You 
 Simple words will never quite express 
 My gratitude to You 
 Until I cross the barrier 
 Mortal words will have to do

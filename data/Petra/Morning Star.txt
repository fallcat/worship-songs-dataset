Every moment of every single day 
 Becomes a testimony to your saving grace 
 Thank you Jesus for all you've done 
 Now the Father can call me His son 
 And the victory's been won 
 Oh, I really love You 
 Oh, I really love You 
 And I want to be where You are 
 Jesus, bright Morning Star 
 Oh, I really love You 
 Oh, I really love You 
 And I want to be where You are 
 Jesus, bright Morning Star 
 That sure salvation that I have gained from You 
 Has changed and rearranged all that I knew 
 When I'm near You my heart's so strong 
 I write the music, but You give the song 
 Let me sing along 
 And now I want to give back to You what You gave to me 
 And feel the joy of offering all of my love and worship to You

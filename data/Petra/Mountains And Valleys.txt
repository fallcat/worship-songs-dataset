Standing high on a mountain, I can see forever 
 All the parts of the puzzle seem to be together 
 The sky is clear and the sun shines on me 
 The Lord is here and I'm feelin' so free 
 Walking through the valley, darkness falls around me 
 Walking through the shadows, evil things surround me 
 I'm not forsaken 
 The Lord is my light 
 I know He's making a way in the night 
 If you've never been in the valley 
 You'll never know 
 How high the mountain is above the valley below 
 When you walk through the valley 
 You've got to keep your head up 
 If you fall or stumble you've got to pick yourself up 
 The Lord is waiting to hear your heart cry 
 He'll always give you another try

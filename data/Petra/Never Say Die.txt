You've been tossing in your sleep 
 All the promises you made that you couldn't keep 
 And you're feeling sorry for yourself 
 Think He's done with you, had Him on the shelf 
 And you're tired of running the race 
 Straying to and fro, falling on your face 
 Oh, you want to throw your towel on in 
 Brother before you do, you better think again 
 Never say die, no 
 You've come too far to turn back now 
 Give it one more try and He'll help you through 
 Never say die, no 
 We are weak but He is strong 
 And strength He will supply 
 When you ask Him to 
 You went wrong, you remember when 
 Instead of pressing toward the mark you missed it once again 
 And you think that you're the only one 
 Who's ever come your way and done what you have done 
 So you try to tuck your tail and run 
 But then you realize you're back where you've begun 
 Oh can't you see Him waiting there for you? 
 With arms wide open now, wanting to see you through 
 Press on, press on 
 Keep your hand upon that plow 
 Press on, press on 
 And he will lead you through somehow

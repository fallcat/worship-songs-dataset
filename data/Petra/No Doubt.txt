There are times when you feel like you can't go on 
 There are times when you feel like giving in 
 And there are times when you feel like you can't try anymore 
 There are times of trouble in believing 
 This test of your faith will last 
 As long as it takes to pass 
 Till you have no more doubt you'll endure 
 And your faith will emerge true and pure 
 No doubt it'll be all right 
 With God it'll work together for good 
 No doubt in the end it will be understood 
 No doubt it'll all work out 
 With faith He can move any mountain for us 
 No doubt in the power of Jesus 
 And after all is done we find out 
 All we really need to have is no doubt 
 There's a time to take a reckless leap of faith 
 There's a time to be cautious and to wait 
 And there's a way of learning from the past 
 That this time of trouble won't last 
 And sometimes we want to think we know 
 The ways He will choose to make us grow 
 But it's never the way of our choosing 
 And we can't always see what He's using 
 There will be winters in the seasons of our soul 
 With a cold and bitter wind that chills our lives 
 But our faith can be building a fire 
 That will warm us till springtime arrives 
 No doubt...

Sometimes we're runnin' along 
 Blind to where we're goin' 
 Sometimes we lose our bearings 
 When the storm is blowin' 
 We know this shadow land is only temporary 
 These light afflictions work a great eternal glory 
 We walk by faith, not by sight 
 Strengthened by His glorious might 
 Walk by faith, not by sight 
 Heading for that land of light 
 Walk by faith and not by sight 
 Sometimes we ain't so sure 
 He sees us when we're kneelin' 
 Sometimes we forget salvation ain't a feelin' 
 We know that Jesus died for our justification 
 We grow in His image by suffering tribulations 
 Hold fast your confidence 
 You've got an invitation 
 To meet Him in the air 
 At His revelation

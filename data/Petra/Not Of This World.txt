We are pilgrims in a strange land 
 We are so far from our homeland 
 With each passing day it seems so clear 
 This world will never want us here 
 We're not welcome in this world of wrong 
 We are foreigners who don't belong 
 We are strangers, we are aliens 
 We are not of this world 
 We are envoys, we must tarry 
 With this message we must carry 
 There's so much to do before we leave 
 With so many more who may believe 
 Our mission here can never fail 
 And the gates of hell will not prevail 
 Jesus told us men would hate us 
 But we must be of good cheer 
 He has overcome this world of darkness 
 Soon we will depart from here

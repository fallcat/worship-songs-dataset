You give me water in a dry and thirsty land 
 You satisfy my hunger 
 Yo feed me from your hand 
 I was a wanderer in the wildnerness 
 Until I stumbled on your oasis 
 And I will stay here with you 
 Here in the shade, here in the cool 
 You keep me safe through the night in your oasis 
 You give your spirit 
 To a dry and thirsty heart 
 You satisfy my longing 
 I hear the voice of God 
 I was a wanderer in my emptiness 
 Until you brought me near your oasis 
 And I will stay here with you 
 Here in the shade, here in the cool 
 You keep me safe through the night in your oasis 
 And I will drink from your well 
 I find my peace here in your shelter 
 And I will stay here with you in your oasis

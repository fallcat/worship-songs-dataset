The enemy surrounds the perimeter 
 Searching for an op'ning 
 Sneaking 'round, tryin' to gain some ground 
 He's laying down a smokescreen 
 Never full, he prowls about 
 For someone to devour 
 Blind with rage, his reign is threatened 
 By a greater power 
 Occupy, occupy 
 Standing firm, lifting high the holy standard 
 Occupy, occupy 
 Till our captain marches in 
 He'll catch your eye with some cheap disguise 
 Or innocent distraction 
 Then he'll infiltrate the ranks 
 And split you into factions 
 He never sleeps, but constantly 
 Is planning some new angle 
 A soldier must be diligent 
 To keep from getting tangled 
 He shall return with the armies of the Lord 
 The King of Kings, in vengeance wielding His sword 
 His strength and His power - revealed in this hour 
 We are His people and He's our great reward

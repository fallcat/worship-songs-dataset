Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war 
 With the cross of Jesus going on before 
 Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng 
 Blend with ours your voices in a triumph song 
 Christ, the Royal Master, leads against the foe 
 Forward into battle, see His banners go, oh 
 Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war 
 With the cross of Jesus going on before 
 Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane 
 But the cross of Jesus constant will remain 
 Marching as to war 
 (Marching as to war) 
 Oh, we're marching as to war 
 (Marching as to war) 
 Oh, we're marching as to war 
 Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng 
 Blend with ours your voices in a triumph song 
 Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war 
 With the cross of Jesus going on before 
 Marching as to war 
 (Marching as to war) 
 Oh, we're marching as to war 
 (Marching as to war)

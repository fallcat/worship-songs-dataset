Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Hebrews 4:13, Psalm 37:18 
 In the evening when I start to pray 
 I think about this day 
 Another page is turned forever 
 Another yesterday 
 And as the story of my life unfolds 
 I know You've read it all 
 Another line to be continued 
 Will I stand or fall 
 Open book - to You I am an open book 
 You know every page by heart 
 From the ending to the start 
 Open book - my life is like an open book 
 As I read between the lines 
 It's Your love that truly binds this open book 
 When the cover of this book is closed 
 The final chapter read 
 I hope You find it worth the reading 
 I hope 'well done' is said 
 Cover to cover 
 Lord, You know me 
 And what I want to be 
 As You read the pages of my heart 
 Please tell me what You see

Words by Chelsea Brandow 
 Based on 1 Peter 4:12-13 
 Traveling far from home 
 Out into the unknown 
 Nothing familiar around me 
 This journey seems so long 
 As I await the dawn 
 All alone and so weary 
 There's a Light over the horizon 
 I'll keep walking down this road of hope 
 Faithful in my prayer 
 There's a Light over the horizon 
 Though I may not know what lies ahead 
 I trust that You'll be there 
 I spend too many days 
 Lost in a mindless haze 
 Not really sure of my purpose 
 And I may question You 
 And what I'm going through 
 When life seems so uncertain 
 Some days are a mystery to me 
 But I believe that answers are revealed in time 
 Even when the path is just not clear 
 I'm anticipating what I'll find 
 Oh... 
 There's a Light over the horizon 
 I'll keep walking down this road of hope 
 Faithful in my prayer 
 There's a Light over the horizon 
 Though I may not know what lies ahead 
 I know that you'll be there 
 You'll be there

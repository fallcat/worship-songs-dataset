Some believe this world is bound to get much better 
 They think utopia is just around the bend 
 They like humanity to come up with the answers 
 So they can keep their heads safely buried in the sand 
 This is my Father's world and He can fix it 
 Our hopeless band-aids are all counterfeit 
 In a perfect world, God's throne will come 
 In a perfect world, in a perfect world 
 In a perfect world ruled by His Son 
 In a perfect world, in a perfect world 
 Some still worship Mother Nature in her glory 
 They do a good thing when they stand up for her right 
 But Mother Nature has a Father in the heavens 
 And His creation went astray but never left His sight 
 The old will pass away and bring a new birth 
 A whole new heaven and a new earth 
 In a perfect world, in a perfect world 
 In a perfect world, in a perfect world 
 Kingdom come 
 His will be done 
 On the earth 
 As it is in heaven 
 Till we come to where there is no night 
 And the Lord Himself will be our light

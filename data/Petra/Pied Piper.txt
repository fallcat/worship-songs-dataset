It's not so hard to understand what people see in you 
 You tell them it's okay to have their cake and eat it too 
 You traded truth for Godless gain and no one will suspect 
 You're such a clever counterfeit of all that you reject 
 Pied piper, playin' the tune they want to hear 
 Putting a tickle in their ear 
 Pied piper, wanting them all to follow you 
 Not know where you lead them too 
 But all the time you're leading them astray 
 The sheep just sit there grinning as they listen to your lies 
 Never knowing when you pull the wool over their eyes 
 You've got them trained to say "How high?" whenever you say "Jump!" 
 And those who disagree with you, you always seem to stump 
 You may not mean to harm a soul you say you're innocent 
 But when the final tally comes, you made more than you spent 
 You knew they'd have to pay the price for listening to you 
 You knew before too long they'd have to pay the Piper too

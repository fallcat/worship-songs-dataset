Praise ye the Lord all ye nations 
 The Lord is reigning, you people rejoice 
 The Word of the Lord is a two-edged sword 
 He's placed it in our hands 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 Praise ye the Lord 
 Praise ye the Lord forever 
 The word of the Lord shall endure forever and ever 
 His merciful kindness is great toward us 
 Is with us to the end 
 Now let us go on to perfection 
 Leaving behind the old carnal mind 
 Press toward the mark of the high call of God 
 Which is the fullness of Christ 
 Praise the Lord for His mercy 
 Praise the Lord for His love 
 His everlasting love 
 Praise the Lord for His kindness 
 Praise the Lord for His Son 
 Jesus is Lord 
 Jesus is Lord 
 Jesus is Lord forever

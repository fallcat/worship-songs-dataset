Words and music by Bob Hartman and John Elefante 
 Based on 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18, Ephesians 6:18-19, Matthew 6:9-13 
 First I want to thank You Lord for being who You are 
 For coming to the rescue of a man who's drifted far 
 For calling me to be Your son and calling me to serve 
 Lord the way You've blessed my life is more than I deserve 
 Keep the ones I love so dearly 
 Fill their emptiness while I am gone 
 And fill the loneliness in me 
 This is my prayer 
 Lifted to You 
 Knowing You care even more than I do 
 This is my prayer 
 Lifted in Your name 
 Your will be done I humbly pray 
 Let me be the evidence of what Your grace can do 
 To a generations struggling to find themselves in You 
 May they come to know the love of God 
 May their eyes be made to see 
 Give me the opportunity to share the truth that sets them free 
 And may unity in all things 
 Be the banner of Your church 
 And let revival's fire begin to burn 
 As we face the last and final hours 
 Turn a wayward country back to You 
 And keep us from the evil that devours 
 Keep us on the path and lead us through 
 Keep us in Your light until Your kingdom comes 
 And our work is done 
 This is my prayer 
 Lifted to You 
 Knowing You care so much more than I do 
 This is my prayer 
 In Jesus' name 
 Your will be done I humbly pray 
 This is my prayer

Words by John Lawry 
 Based on James 5:16b 
 Noah saw the coming of the flood 
 (He built an ark upon dry land) 
 When Moses prayed, 
 God parted the Red Sea 
 (In faith, he made his stand) 
 And David dropped the giant to his knees 
 (Empowered by a stronger hand) 
 God changed the course of history 
 (See the power of the praying man) 
 Faith lives in folded hands 
 Mountains move when you make a stand 
 It's never been a case of sleight of hand 
 It's the power, oh the power of the praying man 
 Whoa, I see the power of the praying man 
 Whoa, I see the power of the praying man 
 Jesus turned the water into wine 
 (No tricks, no magicians) 
 He rules the earth, the wind, the sky 
 (In control of the situation) 
 He knew that 
 Prayer is alive and well today 
 (It's a matter of dedication) 
 Prayer works when you take the time to pray 
 (It's a matter of true devotion) 
 You'll see that

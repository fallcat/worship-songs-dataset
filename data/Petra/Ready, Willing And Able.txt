Ready, Willing, and Able 
 Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 1 Peter 3:15, 2 Timothy 4:2 
 Enough of the sidelines, gotta get in the game 
 When nothing is ventured, nothing is gained 
 He's callin' the numbers play by play 
 We're either out or we're in all the way 
 Get in the action whatever the cost 
 Nothing can equal the worth of the lost 
 Shoulder to shoulder, hand to the plow 
 Today is the day and the right time is now 
 And the field is ready for the new reserve 
 We will bring the harvest with a will to serve 
 Ready, willing and able 
 To advance the light and defend the right 
 Ready, willing and able 
 Lifting up the cross to the waiting lost 
 Ready to serve and willing to go 
 Able to stand against the foe 
 Ready, willing and able 
 Instant in season drop of a hat 
 Bases are loaded, it's our turn at bat 
 Pressure is mounting, the tension is hot 
 Heaven is watching to see what we've got 
 There is strength in numbers 
 There is hope in One 
 We are called and chosen to proclaim His Son 
 He's already given us all that we need 
 With love in our message and hope in our creed 
 When Yahweh is for us and faith is our stay 
 No power below us can stand in our way

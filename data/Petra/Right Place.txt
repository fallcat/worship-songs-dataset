Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 1 Peter 4:12,13 
 Got no place to run, gotta look up to see the bottom 
 No visible support - no one there you can lean on 
 You're all on your own - you know it's sink or swim 
 There is no doubt about it, you have to look to Him 
 When you think you've had enough 
 No more you can do 
 When you feel like giving up 
 Deadline is in view 
 When your time is almost gone 
 You haven't got a clue 
 Now's the time to turn your face 
 You're in the right place - trusting only Him 
 You're in the right place - kick back and just depend 
 You're in the right place - to see what He can do 
 You're in the right place - He will come through 
 When you're sinking fast - takin' water in your boat 
 No one to bail you out - you think it's all she wrote 
 The odds are against you - your chances slim to none 
 A hopeless situation - you got no place to run 
 No one has a rescue plan 
 Waiting in the wings 
 Now's the time to call His name 
 He can do all things 
 When your self-reliance fails 
 You still have a prayer 
 You will have to trust His grace 
 When you abide, He will provide 
 Never shorthanded 
 When you will pray, He'll make a way 
 He won't leave you stranded

Words and music by Mike Hudson 
 Based on Psalm 84:5-7 
 There is a way that leads to life 
 The few that find it never die 
 Past mountain peaks graced white with snow 
 The way grows brighter as it goes 
 There is a road inside of you 
 Inside of me there is one too 
 No stumbling pilgrim in the dark 
 The road to Zion's in your heart 
 The road to Zion's in your heart 
 The river runs beside the road 
 Its waters living as they flow 
 In liquid voice the water calls 
 On thirsty knees the pilgrim falls 
 Sometimes a shadow dark and cold 
 Lays like a mist across the road 
 But be encouraged by the sight 
 Where there's a shadow, there's a light 
 Sometimes it's good to look back down 
 We've come so far - we've gained such ground 
 But joy is not in where we've been 
 Joy is who's waiting at the end

 [Everybody, c'mon 
 Put your hands together 
 We'll do this for the Lord, c'mon] 
 The battle cry is getting louder 
 The countdown's close to the final hour 
 The enemy is on every side 
 Still no match for the crucified 
 Victory, on to victory! 
 We are soldiers in His army 
 Stand up! 
 Take a stand for Jesus 
 Stand up! 
 So the whole world sees us 
 Showing a way to a world gone astray 
 Shining are light, with all of our might! 
 Stand up! 
 Take a stand for Jesus 
 Stand up! 
 So the whole world sees us 
 Following Him, serving Him 
 Fighting the fight we know we will win! 
 (Yes, we will win!) 
 We gotta lay our lives down 
 Stand up for the truth we found 
 Gotta let the redeemed of the Lord say so! 
 (Yes!) 
 (Yeah!) 
 [C'mon, help us out 
 Wooh! 
 For the King of kings!] 
 Sometimes we're running along 
 Blind to where we're goin' 
 Sometimes, we lose our bearings 
 When the storm is blowing 
 They say the shadowland 
 Is only temporary 
 These light afflictions work 
 Of great eternal glory! 
 Walk by faith 
 Not by sight 
 Stranded, by His glorious might! 
 Walk by faith 
 Not by sight 
 Heading for that land of light! 
 Walk by faith 
 And not by sight! 
 Hold fast your confidence 
 You've got an invitation 
 To meet Him in the air 
 At His revelation 
 Hah! Hah! 
 I wonder how it makes You feel when the prodigal won't come home 
 I wonder how it makes You feel when he'd rather be on his own 
 I wonder what it's like for You when a lamb has gone astray 
 I wonder what it's like for You when Your children disobey 
 It must be like another thorn stuck in Your brow 
 It must be like another close friend's broken vow 
 It must be like another nail right through Your wrist 
 It must be just like, just like Judas' kiss 
 It must be like another thorn stuck in Your brow 
 It must be like another close friend's broken vow 
 It must be like another nail right through Your wrist 
 It must be just like, just like Judas' kiss

Another sleepy Sunday, safe within the walls 
 Outside a dying world in desperation calls 
 But no one hears the cries, or knows what they're about 
 The doors are locked within, or is it from, without... 
 Looking through rose colored stained glass windows 
 Never allowing the world to come in 
 Seeing no evil and feeling no pain 
 Making the light as it comes from within, so dim... 
 Out on the doorstep lay the masses in decay 
 Ignore them long enough, maybe they'll go away 
 When you have so much you think, you have so much to lose 
 You think you have no lack, when you're really destitute 
 Looking through rose colored stained glass windows - stained glass windows! 
 Never allowing the world to come in - they won't lemmie come in! 
 Seeing no evil and feeling no pain - no feel, no pain! 
 Making the light as it comes from within, so dim - the light's so dim! 
 - So dim - the light's so dim! 
 Looking through rose colored stained glass windows 
 Never allowing the world to come in 
 Seeing no evil and feeling no pain 
 Making the light as it comes from within, so dim, so dim!

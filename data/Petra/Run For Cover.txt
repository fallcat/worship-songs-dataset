Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 1 Peter 5:5 
 You muyst have seen the light somewhere along the way 
 The flashing warning sign that you would not obey 
 You ran the roadblock before the danger zone 
 You cut the lifeline - now you're on your own 
 Run for cover - better get under authority 
 Run for cover - better listen to somebody 
 Like a lone ranger running through the night 
 With no one to tell you if you're wrong or right 
 Run for cover 
 You want to call the shots - you want to take control 
 You want to throw the dice and gamble with your soul 
 Taking the liberties that grace will not afford 
 Is He your Master, can you call Him Lord? 
 Why do you stand out in the rain 
 What do you think you have to gain 
 When you try in your own strength but don't prevail 
 The arm of flesh will always fail

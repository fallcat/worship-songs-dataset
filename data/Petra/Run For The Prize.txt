Alone on the sidelines without any guidelines 
 You've been running to fast with no place to go 
 You've got no direction, you gotta set your affection 
 On the things that can bring you right back in the flow 
 You got to run for the prize 
 Don't look over your shoulder 
 Gotta keep your eyes 
 On the straight and narrow 
 Gotta run for the prize 
 There's no time to be wandering 
 Gotta make your way 
 Just as straight as an arrow 
 You may be weary, but you gotta be leary 
 When somebody says that you will never finish the race 
 They can discourage but don't lose your courage 
 You gotta narrow the margin and keep up the pace 
 Gotta lay aside every weight and run the race that's before us 
 If we grow weary and faint, the Father He will restore us

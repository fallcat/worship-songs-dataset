You never tried to win more secular appeal 
 And water down Your message with a slightly different feel 
 You never tried to be politically correct 
 Or skirt around the issue attempting to connect 
 You spoke the truth in love so faithfully 
 You expect no less from me 
 It's a sacred trust that You gave to us 
 To take Your Word into all the world 
 It's a sacred trust that You gave to us 
 The message of salvation and Your love 
 You never shied away from critical debate 
 Or beat around the bushes when discussing human fate 
 You weren't ashamed to tell them who Your Father was 
 Never ran from persecution like human nature does 
 You prayed for all believers on Your knees 
 Then you handed us the keys 
 You're trusting us to be bold 
 The story has to be told 
 To every nation and tongue 
 Young and old 
 I'm gonna shout from the hill 
 How could I ever be still? 
 I'm gonna let the chips fall 
 Where they will 
 You spoke the truth in love so faithfully 
 You expect no less from me

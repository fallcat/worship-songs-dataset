You remember Sally, used to be so happy 
 Walkin' down that street with a smile upon her face 
 Never had a worry, she never had a care 
 And when she came to see me she would brighten up my face 
 Sally was that kind of girl, sure would like to know 
 And everywhere that Sally went the lamb was sure to go 
 Somebody said they saw her on the other side of town 
 Said she was smokin' weed and drinkin', probably foolin' 'round 
 That's too bad about Sally because she was so nice 
 The next time that I see that girl, I'll give her my advice 
 Why would she want to run away from God and all His love 
 And go back in that world and live so hard and rough 
 You know that I don't feel too bad, Sally moved away 
 'Cause every time I'd look at her she set my mind astray 
 Now Sally was that kind of girl, I wish that she was mine 
 Just to know that she was there, even that was fine 
 There's just one thing that I don't understand 
 And that's the part that's the part that's rough 
 Why would she want to run away from God and all His love 
 Repeat twice

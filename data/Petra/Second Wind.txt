Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Long-distance run from darkness 
 Headed into the sun 
 And it seems like eternity 
 Till this race is won 
 Soul and spirit weak and weary 
 Strength was was almost gone 
 When a soothing gentle breeze carried me further on 
 I've got my second wind, Spirit's coming again 
 I've got a new revelation from the King of Kings 
 Found my second wind, feel my strength returning again 
 Returning again 
 Through a desert night in darkness 
 Racing toward the light 
 There were too many hills to climb 
 And too many battles to fight 
 Then distant lights were calling 
 Beckoned me as a guest 
 When I found the oasis there 
 I entered into a rest 
 Just when I thought I couldn't run any longer 
 I got my second wind 
 Just when I thought I'd never be any stronger 
 I got my second wind 
 Just when I thought that I would fall into darkness 
 I got my second wind 
 Just when I thought that I would fail every test 
 I got my second wind

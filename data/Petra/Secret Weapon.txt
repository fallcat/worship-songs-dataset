Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 1:9, 2 Corinthians 10:4 
 I've waited patiently for your reply 
 You say you'll come around by and by 
 I've tried to show the way into the light 
 But I just won't let you go without a fight 
 You think my hands are tied 
 But you will never hide, no 
 I've got you in my sight day and night 
 I've got a secret weapon 
 I'll pray for you 
 I've got a secret weapon 
 Gonna get through 
 I really care about you 
 I'll pray for you 
 I've told you everything you need to know 
 But you still fluctuate to and fro 
 You just can't push yourself over the edge 
 So I will pull the rug behind the hedge 
 How can you ever lose 
 This deal you can't refuse 
 So with your hands up high 
 Reach for the sky 
 I won't give up on you 
 I'll pray until the night is through 
 And you surrender to the light 
 Come on surrender

Too many black sheep in the family 
 Too many stones from a house of glass 
 They've heard the stories, they've heard the lines 
 But talk is to cheap to change their minds 
 They want to see some vital signs 
 Convictions- in the way we live 
 Convictions- not a narrative 
 Actions speak a little louder than words 
 Seen and not heard, seen and not heard 
 Sometimes God's children should be seen and 
 Not heard 
 There's too much talk and not enough walk 
 Sometimes God's children should be seen and 
 Not heard 
 Delayed reaction to hostilities 
 Brings us into reality 
 'Cause when we answer in our defense 
 They can see through the flase pretense 
 They want to see some evidence 
 Commitment- no more alibis 
 Commitment- not a compromise 
 Actions speak a little louder than words 
 Let your light so shine in all you do 
 With an answer near when they come to you 
 Don't let your mouth start talkin' 
 Until your feet start walkin'

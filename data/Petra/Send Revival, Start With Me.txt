Send Revival, Start With Me 
 Words by Matt Redman 
 Based on 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 6:5-8 
 We're looking to your promise of old 
 That if we pray and humble ourselves 
 You will come and heal our land 
 You will come, You will come 
 We're looking to the promise You made 
 That if we turn and look to Your face 
 You will come and heal our land 
 You will come, You will come 
 To us 
 Send revival, start with me 
 For I am one of unclean lips 
 And my eyes have seen the King 
 Your glory I have glimpsed 
 Send revival, start with me

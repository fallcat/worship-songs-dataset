He likes caviar, he likes champagne 
 Calls his broker just to check his gain 
 He made a profit of considerable size 
 Don't ask him no questions, he will tell you no lies 
 He kept thinking that he had it made 
 Never considering the price he paid 
 Earth bound treasures that will fade away 
 There ain't nothin' that will last him through the judgement day 
 Then he heard somebody say 
 There's a true Way 
 You'll be set for life 
 If you give your heart and believe what He's done for you 
 You'll be set for life 
 With your treasures stored up in heaven when you're through 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Never have another care, as long as you are there 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Rich in God beyond compare 
 Now these days, he's like a different man 
 He's got a heart of gold, he lends a helping hand 
 All he has he knows is never his 
 His heart is up in heaven where his treasure is 
 And now you'll hear him say 
 In his own way 
 You'll be set for life 
 You'll have all you need 
 Just receive with a willing heart 
 You'll be set for life 
 You'll be on your way 
 Any day you decide to start 
 Set for life 
 You've got it made 
 Now he has the right to say 
 In a true way

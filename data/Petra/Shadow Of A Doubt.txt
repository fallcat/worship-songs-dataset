Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on James 1:6-8 
 Shadows of a different kind 
 Come and cloud my mind 
 And make me wonder 
 Am I still in touch with You? 
 Or could it be my doubting point of view? 
 Seems like only yesterday 
 I was seeing clearly through the haze 
 Now I find I'm not so sure 
 When a shadow casts it's doubt upon my ways 
 Beyond a shadow of a doubt 
 I seem to find You waiting there 
 Behind the wall of my own reason 
 I discover how You care 
 Lord, I know You won't ignore my prayer 
 Through faith I'll find You waiting 
 Beyond a shadow of a doubt 
 I know You are waiting there 
 I can hear You when I'm listening 
 I can't see You clearly now 
 And I know that I am missing all You have... 
 I will follow You although I cannot see my way 
 Cast Your light upon these shadows 
 Make them go away 
 If I hear Your voice I will obey 
 Help my unbelief and help me go...

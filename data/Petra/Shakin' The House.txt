There's a rumble, in the distance 
 A trembling in the air 
 It's uncertain in direction 
 Does is come from here or there? 
 It's approaching by the minute 
 Does it lead you to despair? 
 Feel it shakin' your foundation 
 When you haven't got a prayer 
 Everything that can be shaken will be shaken from within 
 Better have your house in order when the shakin' begins 
 Shakin' the house 
 Shakin' 
 Shakin' the house 
 You examine your foundation 
 Does is stand on rock or sand? 
 When the smoke clears does it bring fears 
 When the houses fall or stand 
 In the fire od refining with flames too high to douse 
 You remember someone saying 
 It's beginning in the house 
 But don't fear when it comes near 
 And you see the raging fire 
 If you hold fast it will all pass 
 Till your heart has His desire

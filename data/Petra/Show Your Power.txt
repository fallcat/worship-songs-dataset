He is the Lord and He reigns on high 
 He is the Lord 
 Spoke into the darkness, creating the Light 
 He is the Lord 
 Who is like unto Him, never ending in days 
 He is the Lord 
 And He comes in power when we call on His name 
 He is the Lord 
 Show Your power 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 Show Your power 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 Your Gospel, oh, Lord is the hope for our nation 
 You are the Lord 
 It's the power of God for our salvation 
 You are the Lord 
 Show Your power 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 Show Your power 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 We ask not for riches but look to the cross 
 'Cause you are the Lord 
 And for our inheritance give us the loss 
 You are the Lord 
 Send Your power 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 Send Your power 
 Oh, Lord, our God 
 Oh, Lord, our God

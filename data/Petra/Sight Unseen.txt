Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Hebrews 11:6 
 For so long I was depending upon 
 My senses and fences, I tried to ride on 
 And trusting in things that can never be seen 
 Was always a crutch on which others must lean 
 Thinking if I could see I would believe 
 Then somebody said believe and you will see 
 Sight unseen, sight unseen 
 You have to take it sight unseen 
 Blinded by the darkness only faith can come between 
 Sight unseen, sight unseen 
 Evidence built into every design 
 Led to conviction between every line 
 Faith is the key that can open the veil 
 To Love incarnated and pierced with a nail 
 Listen my friend, have I got news for you 
 The nails in His hands and feet were meant for you

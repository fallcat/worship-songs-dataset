Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 12:9 
 I've lived in my own way 
 And found that there's a price to pay 
 And I felt the emptiness 
 Without Your tenderness 
 Now before You I confess 
 Here is all I have to give 
 I offer up this life I live 
 I am sincerely Yours 
 Now in all sincerity 
 I give You all of me (Jesus) 
 I am sincerely Yours 
 This prodigal is standing here 
 Now with all my senses clear 
 For all You gave to me 
 I spent it foolishly 
 You've been waiting patiently 
 Now I feel the weight on me is lifting 
 You've washed away the past 
 And now there is a new day dawning 
 As long as I keep holding 
 As long as I keep holding fast 
 I am Sincerely Yours 
 Sincerely Yours

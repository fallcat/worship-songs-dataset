Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 13:11, Isaiah 60:1 
 Whoa, sleeping the night away 
 Darkness enclosing the world so desperate for day 
 We're under the spell of disunity 
 When will this giant awake and stand and be free 
 Now the hour has come 
 To awaken and redeem the time given to the night 
 Curse this darkness and stand in the light 
 Can you hear the alarm echo down the hall 
 The sleeping giant gets a wake-up call 
 Awake from your sleep 'cause it's time to stand tall 
 The sleeping giant gets a wake-up call 
 The sleeping giant gets a wake-up call 
 Whoa, been sleeping so long, yeah 
 How can we hope to discern the right from the wrong? 
 The gauntlet is thrown in the face of denial 
 Each time we sleep through an inch we're losing a mile 
 We will get this rude awakening to reality 
 And arise in unity 
 It's been dark for so long night is almost gone 
 Always darkest before the dawn 
 Sunlight soon appearing, a new day it will bring 
 Do you feel it?

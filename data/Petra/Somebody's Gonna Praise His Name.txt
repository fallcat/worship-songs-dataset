Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Luke 19:40, Psalm 69:34, 148:9 
 Somebody's gonna praise His name 
 Somebody's gonna call Him Lord 
 It'll either be you and me 
 Or it's gonna be a rock or tree 
 Somebody, somewhere is gonna praise His name 
 Jesus said that it couldn't be stopped 
 Jesus said that it had to be heard 
 His creation will praise Him 
 Jesus said we could be assured 
 If we all maintain our silence 
 Even stones will cry out so loud 
 His creation will praise Him 
 All alone or in a crowd 
 In the end every tongue will confess 
 Every knee will eventually bow 
 His creation will praise Him 
 It's so easy to go for it now 
 And it's gonna be me 
 It's gonna be me 
 Somebody's gonna praise Him 
 And it's gonna be me 
 Lord I lift my voice to You 
 And I magnify Your name 
 You are Alpha and Omega 
 You are everyday the same 
 As long as I draw breath my lips will praise You 
 As long as I have strength I want to praise Your name

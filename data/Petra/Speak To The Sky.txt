In a corner with no windows - no apparent way to go 
 No escape hatch, must be some catch 
 Must be something you don't know 
 Look down, look around, all your hopes are sinking deep into the ground 
 Look up through the night, SOS is gonna make it to the light when you 
 Speak the sky and wait for the answer 
 Someone will be there to take your call 
 Though you may be at the brink of disaster 
 Speak to the sky and you never will fall 
 When temptaion will surround you 
 Enemy is closing fast 
 Fight insistence with resistance 
 You can know that it won't last 
 Look out, look around, cryin' out but no one seems to hear a sound 
 Look into your heart, help is on the way before you even start to

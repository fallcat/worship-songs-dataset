Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 7:19 
 Late one night I heard a knock at the door 
 The boys were really painting the town 
 I was just another bored teenage boy 
 Kickin' up and actin' the clown... Yeah 
 One dare led to another dare 
 Then things were getting out of control 
 We hopped the fence and we stole the pears 
 And I threw away a part of my soul 
 Yes, I threw away a part of my soul (now it's) 
 Haunting me how I stole those pears 
 'Cause I loved the wrong 
 Even though I knew a better way 
 Not for hunger or poverty 
 It was more than pears that I ended up 
 Throwin' away... Yeah 
 Time goes by - now I'm old and grey 
 Those pears are just a memory 
 I would gladly pay all I have today 
 But that's just not the problem you 
 See... ('cause it's) 
 Why do we love all the things that are wrong 
 Forbidden fruit has a strange siren song 
 Why do we do what we don't want to do 
 When we live with regrets our whole lifethrough 
 And I don't even like pears that well...

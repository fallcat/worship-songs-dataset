Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Ezekiel 22:30, 1 Timothy 2:1, James 5:16 
 There's no feeling 
 Like when you have a friend in need 
 Their heart is wounded - 
 And you can feel your own heart bleed 
 And you wonder 
 Will they pull through this attack 
 You feel so helpless - you want to be fighting back 
 Don't think it's over - don't pull away 
 It's time to stand in - it's time to pray 
 Set the wheels in motion 
 With your devotion 
 Stand in the gap 
 Coming boldly to His throne of grace 
 Stand in the gap 
 He will hear you when you seek His face 
 Put your weapon to its use 
 And believe it will produce 
 Stand in the gap 
 Until all hell... 
 Until all hell breaks loose 
 In the conflict 
 It seems like He doesn't hear 
 Be encouraged - He still has an open ear 
 It's not for nothing 
 It's not in vain 
 Make your petitions 
 Call on His name 
 He will bring assistance 
 Through your persistence 
 The enemy is gonna have to fold his hand 
 When the army of the Lord begins to take command 
 Nothing in the heavens or the earth can stand 
 Against the fervent prayer of a righteous man

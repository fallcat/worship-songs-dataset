The Battle cry's getting louder 
 The countdown's close to the final hour 
 The enemy is on every side 
 Still no match for the Crucified 
 Victory unto victory 
 We are soldiers in His army 
 Stand up, take a stand for Jesus 
 Stand up, so the whole world sees us 
 Showing the way to a world gone astray 
 Shing our light with all of our might 
 Stand up, take a stand for Jesus 
 Stand up, so the whole world sees us 
 Following Him, and serving Him 
 Fighting the fight that we know we will win 
 Out of our pews and into the streets 
 Making some use of our beautiful feet 
 Redeeming the time for the days are evil 
 This whole world's in such upheaval 
 We wrestle not with flesh and blood 
 But when the enemy comes in like a flood 
 Gotta lay our lives down 
 And stand up for the truth we've found 
 Gotta let the redeemed of the Lord say so

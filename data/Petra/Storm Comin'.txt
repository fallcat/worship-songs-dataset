Went to sleep last night and I woke up feeling right 
 Daylight in my eyes and it seemed to be really bright 
 I went to the window and I looked up in the sky 
 I saw the angels coming but I knew it wasn't time to die 
 I took a look around I saw the clouds begin to form 
 I knew we must be near the end because the clouds come before the storm 
 I know the time is near 
 Lightning and thunder will soon here 
 Storm comin' 
 And it's coming our way 
 Storm comin' 
 And it might come today 
 (Look out, here it comes) 
 I know my days are numbered 
 And I haven't got long to roam 
 It seems like quite a while I've been feeling like I want to go home 
 I'm just waiting for the day when Jesus will come and take me by the hand 
 There's no need to worry, He's gonna take me to the promise land 
 I hope you'll be there too 
 Jesus is waiting for you 
 Storm comin' 
 And it's coming our way 
 Storm comin' 
 And it might come today 
 (Look out, here it comes)

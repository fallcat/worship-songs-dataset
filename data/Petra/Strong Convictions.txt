Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Romans 12:2 
 Western world where the strong survive 
 And the meek will inherit the dregs 
 Living now in the twilight time 
 Will the world hear the answer it begs 
 Secular and sacred blur 
 Without even raising a flag 
 When so many masters call 
 Is it the tail or the dog that will wag? 
 With some among us weak at the knees 
 And many others who do as they please 
 There still remains a witness 
 The few who will stand and say 
 I've got strong convictions 'bout the way that I live 
 I've got no concessions that I'm willing ot give 
 Strong convictions that are worth living by 
 Strong convictions till the day I die 
 It's so hard seeing black and white 
 When so much appears to be gray 
 WIth no faith in the absolute 
 It's no wonder the standard will stray 
 With bold convictions leading the way 
 With those who have them willing to say 
 There is a new horizon 
 I can say as for me and mine 
 Pressure makes the perfect diamond 
 Measure of the saints refining 
 Don't ever want to stray 
 I really want to stay 
 Steadfast and immovable in Him

If all you got is a fancy car 
 And a precious diamond ring 
 When you stand before the Lord 
 Will it really mean a thing? 
 You've got to see how good your life can be 
 You've got to feel what's really, really real 
 How can you know until you taste and see 
 How good it is to be set free? 
 Taste and see that the Lord is good 
 He's got milk and honey for you 
 Come and dine at the Master's table, 
 He'll serve bread and wine to you 
 Well you tasted this and you tasted that 
 But you still ain't satisfied 
 You'll never find any peace of mind 
 In those empty things you tried 
 Don't be afraid of tasting something new 
 Your soul is hungry, nothing else will do 
 The bread of life will keep you saitsfied 
 You won't go hungry or ever be denied 
 You've got to make up your mind 
 And leave your old life behind you 
 You know He'll take it away

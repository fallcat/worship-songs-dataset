One moment gone into the past 
 But here and now will never last 
 You made the most of your design 
 You've walked alone 
 You held the line 
 That's when you know you've passed 
 The test of time 
 The time has come, the time has gone 
 The time is now, but not for long 
 Before you take a second glance 
 Redeem the time and take a chance 
 It's not too late to pass 
 The test of time 
 And the time is passing every moment that you take 
 The test of time 
 It's the test of choices that you have to make 
 It's what you're doin' and how you're livin' 
 It's how you're spending the time you're given 
 The test of time 
 Tomorrow is a chance that may not come 
 Today is still the day God gives us 
 To see things done 
 Your own test of time has begun 
 Time will slip away 
 Every moment passing by 
 The choices that we make will stand the test of time 
 Time will slip away 
 Every moment passing by 
 The choices that we make will stand the test of time

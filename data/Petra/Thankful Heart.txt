I have a thankful heart 
 That you have given me 
 And it can only come from you... 
 There is no way to begin 
 To tell you how I feel 
 There are no words to express 
 How you've become so real 
 Jesus you've given me 
 So much I can't repay 
 I have no offering 
 I have a thankful heart 
 That you have given me 
 And it can only come from you 
 I have a thankful heart 
 Word's don't come easily 
 But I am sure you can see 
 My thankful heart 
 There is no way to begin 
 To tell you how I feel 
 There are no words to express 
 How you've become so real 
 Jesus you've given me 
 So much I can't repay 
 I have no offering 
 I have a thankful heart 
 That you have given me 
 And it can only come from you 
 I have a thankful heart 
 Words don't come easily 
 But I am sure you can see 
 My thankful heart 
 Help me be a man of God 
 A man who's after your own heart 
 Help me show my gratitude 
 And keep in me a thankful heart 
 I have a thankful heart 
 That you have given me 
 And it can only come from you 
 I have a thankful heart 
 Words don't come easily 
 But I am sure you can see 
 My thankful heart 
 Thankful heart...

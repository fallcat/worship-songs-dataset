In heavenly armour we'll enter the land 
 The battle belongs to the Lord 
 No weapon that's fashioned against us shall stand 
 The battle belongs to the Lord 
 We sing glory and honor 
 Power and strength to the Lord 
 (Repeat) 
 The power of darkness comes in like a flood 
 The battle belongs to the Lord 
 He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood 
 The battle belongs to the Lord 
 When your enemy presses in hard do not fear 
 The battle belongs to the Lord 
 Take courage my friend, your redemption is near 
 The battle belongs to the Lord

Red is the color of the blood that flowed 
 Down the face of someone who loved us so 
 He's the perfect man, He's the Lord's own son 
 He's the lamb of God, He's the only one 
 That can give us life, that can make us grow 
 That can make the love between us flow 
 Blue is the color of a heart so cold 
 That will not bend when the story's told 
 Of the love of God for a sinful race 
 Of the blood that flowed down Jesus face 
 That can give us life, that can make us grow 
 That can keep our hearts from growing cold 
 Gold is the color of the morning sun 
 That shines so freely on everyone 
 It's the sun above that keeps us warm 
 It's the Son of Love that calms the storm 
 That can give us life, that can make us grow 
 That can turn our mornings into gold 
 Brown is the color of the autumn leaves 
 When the winter comes to the barren trees 
 There is birth, there death, there is a plan 
 And there's just one God and there's just one man 
 That can give us life, that can make us grow 
 That can make our sins as white as snow 
 That can give us life, that can make us grow 
 That can turn our mornings into gold 
 That can give us life that can make us grow 
 That can keep our hearts from growing cold 
 That can give us life that can make us grow 
 That can make the love between us flow

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Matthew 22:2-10 
 The King has planned the supper for the wedding of His Son 
 And He sent out His servants to invite the chosen ones 
 But they would not receive them and they all refused to come 
 So He sent them to the highways inviting everyone 
 They came from every direction 
 They entered into the gates of the One 
 The One who called them and gave them the right to sit next to His Son 
 Do you see... 
 It's your invitation 
 Your presence is requested at the marriage of the Lamb 
 It's your invitation 
 To be the guest of honor at the wedding of the Great I Am 
 They'll come from every nation, tribe, and tongue 
 All those with ears to hear Him knocking 
 There will be rich and poor alike 
 There will be old and young 
 He stands outside of the door 
 Not all will hear Him but there will be some 
 They'll hear the voice of the Bride and the voice of the Spirit 
 Say, "come" 
 Do you hear... 
 Oh, He's God's worthy Lamb 
 We'll drink from the Water of Life 
 In garments of white 
 With no end in sight 
 Did you know...

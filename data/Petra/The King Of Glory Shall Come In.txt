The Levites returned with the Ark of the Lord 
 The presence and strength of the God they adored 
 The temple was shut with the gatekeepers near 
 The priests would sing out till their nation could hear 
 Be lifted up everlasting doors 
 The King of Glory shall come in 
 Who is this King of Glory? 
 The Lord strong and mighty 
 Open your gates to the Lord of Hosts 
 Who is this King of Glory? 
 The Lord mighty in battle 
 The King of Glory shall come in 
 The King of Glory shall come in 
 Who can ascend to the hill of the Lord 
 Those with clean hands and an innocent heart 
 Who can be found in His holy place 
 Those who are humble and seek his face 
 Now we are the temple, He dwells in our hearts 
 The priesthood of faith that His Spirit imparts 
 This King is the One who can save from sin 
 He stands at the door and He wants to come in

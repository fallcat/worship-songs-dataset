Words by Joel Hanson 
 In each heart there is a longing 
 In each soul a desperate cry 
 To know if life has some true meaning 
 Or if we simply live and die 
 Earthly pleasures and possessions 
 Leave the sinking spirit dry 
 In each heart there is a longing 
 Only Jesus satisfies 
 In each life there comes the question 
 Is there more than meets the eye 
 And what will we see of the eternal 
 When the well of days runs dry? 
 So we search with so few finding 
 The difference between truth and lies 
 While in each heart there is a longing 
 Only Jesus satisfies 
 Mysetery on a hillside 
 The purest love expressed 
 Guilty lips cry forgive me 
 In that moment I found rest 
 So we search with so few finding 
 The difference between truth and lies 
 While in each heart there is a longing 
 Only Jesus satisfies

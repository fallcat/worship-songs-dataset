This is the noise we make with our voice and with our hands 
 We've come to celebrate all across this land 
 The joy that's in our hearts makes us want to dance for you 
 Join as the angels sing and worship as they do 
 And we worship you alone with our songs of praise 
 One day before your throne 
 This is the noise we make 
 You are worthy, worthy 
 You are worthy, worthy 
 You are holy, holy 
 You are holy, holy 
 And we worship you alone with our songs of praise 
 One day before your throne 
 This is the noise we make

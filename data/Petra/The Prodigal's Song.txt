I'm only happy when I'm with you 
 And living life the way you show me 
 Whenever I'm apart, I grow a colder heart 
 I only feign my love for you 
 And if a day goes by without speaking 
 I love like I don't really need you 
 But in my heart I find I recognize the lie 
 My every breath I draw from you 
 And I still find you true, pulling me back to you 
 To you I will run 
 The prodigal son 
 Coming back home again to you 
 Open your arms 
 And into your heart 
 I'm folded in love again with you 
 And every moment that I've wasted 
 Chasing after my own dreaming 
 I know you will forgive and wipe away the tears 
 For all the lonely foolish years 
 And I will try to be true, living each day with you 
 All that I am 
 And all that I have 
 And all I can be 
 Is found in you

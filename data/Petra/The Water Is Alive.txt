Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on John 4:10,13-14, John 7:38 
 Gazing out across this desert world 
 There are thirsty souls everywhere you go 
 Searching for a drink to satisfy 
 Their thirsty hearts till they overflow 
 They come up empty when the sun goes down 
 And they look around and they wonder why 
 Their grand delusion seems to quickly fade 
 When their own supply leaves them high and dry 
 They could be drinking living water till they're satisfied 
 Whosoever will won't ever be denied 
 The water is alive, there is no doubt 
 The water is alive, feel it flowing out 
 Alive - coming from within 
 Alive - and I will never thirst again 
 And now beneath the desert stars tonight 
 The oasis waits for those who roam 
 It seems so hard to think there was a time 
 That I used to call this wasteland home 
 He lets me drink the living water till I'm satisfied 
 Whosoever will won't ever be denied 
 Now and forever it will satisfy your thirsty soul 
 Now and forever living water makes your spirit whole 
 You could be drinking living water till you're satisfied 
 Whosoever will won't ever be denied

Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Philippians 4:8 
 In solitary time the thoughts run through my mind 
 Some from the very throne some origins unknown 
 I know there's a danger waiting 
 Thoughts held in captivity 
 The vain imaginations that long to be set free 
 I hold the key 
 With thoughts of purity 
 Whatever things are pure and true, 
 (I want to) 
 Think on these things 
 Whatever things are filled with virtue 
 Think on these things 
 When my mind begins to stray 
 I want to think the other way 
 Think on these things 
 Think on these things 
 Into the conscious flow the tributaries go 
 The source from which they start 
 Abundance of the heart 
 My mind has a mind of its own 
 Choosing negativity 
 Only the thoughts of virtue 
 Withhold the raging sea 
 I turn the tide 
 By choosing to abide 
 Whatever things are honest 
 Whatever things are just 
 Whatever things are lovely 
 I will put my trust 
 In the things that never cease 
 To keep my heart in perfect peace

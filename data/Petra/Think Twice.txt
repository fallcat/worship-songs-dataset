Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on 2 Timothy 2:22 
 You can think of times when you had the right chance 
 You could make a choice when nobody could see 
 You could think of ways of defending your deeds 
 Justify the way that you wanted to be 
 Wait just a minute 
 Wait just a minute 
 Hey, did you ever think twice 
 Something inside says stay away 
 Hey, did you ever think twice 
 When there's still time you can go the other way 
 Hey, did you ever think twice 
 If you don't stop you're gonna' pay the price 
 Hey, did you ever think twice 
 You can think of things that you wanted to try 
 You can think of things that you wish you could see 
 You could go a way that would seem so right 
 Thinking of a place that you wish you could be 
 Wait just a minute 
 Wait just a minute 
 Face to face with sin 
 You better think again, you better think again 
 Take another look for a second time 
 And give a second thought to where you draw the line 
 Wait just a minute 
 Wait just a minute

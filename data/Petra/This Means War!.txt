Romans 16:20, Isaiah 14:12-15 
 Words and Music by Bob Hartman 
 Son of the morning--highest of all 
 You had so much going till you took the fall 
 Had a place in the glory but you wanted it all 
 Impossible odds but you had the gall 
 It seemed so unlikely that you would rebel 
 Such a worthy opponent that you knew so well 
 But you went down fighting when you heard the bell 
 Took a third of all heaven when you went to hell 
 This means war--and the battle's still raging 
 War--and though both sides are waging 
 The Victor is sure and the victory secure 
 But till judgement we all must endure 
 This Means War! 
 Then came the cross--you thought you had won 
 You thought you had conquered God's only Son 
 "So much for Jesus" you said in jest 
 Then you got a visit from an unwelcome guest 
 Now it's all over down to the wire 
 Counting the days to your own lake of fire 
 But you'll go down fighting for all that you're worth 
 To try to abolish His image on earth

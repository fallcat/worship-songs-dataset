 Based on Col. 3:17 
 I could never hide away in a place that You won't see 
 Caught between the way I am and the way I want to be 
 You can take away the mask that hides the man inside 
 You illuminate the ways of darkness I denied 
 And even though You see 
 You keep on lifting me 
 Till everything I do I do for You 
 Through every test of faith You take me through 
 Till every path I take is straight and true 
 Till everything I do I do for You 
 One by one You chip away at the edges of my heart 
 Till You see the hardness and the willfulness depart 
 You let me see my pride 
 Then pull me to Your side 
 Though I grow closer to the image You intend for me 
 I won't be all I'm meant to be 
 Till face to face I see

From the depths of the deep blue sea 
 To the end of the heavenlies 
 He is God over all the earth 
 To the end of the universe 
 He reigns from his throne on high 
 He reigns over you and I 
 I'll testify 
 Too big, too big 
 Our God is too big to fail 
 Too big, our God is too big 
 Too big, too big 
 Our God is too big to fail 
 Too big, our God is too big to fail 
 He's loving and merciful 
 His grace is unsearchable 
 He's Lord over sea and sod 
 There is none who is like our God 
 He stretched forth the heavens 
 And He laid the foundations of the earth 
 All glory and honor 
 And praise to the one who lives and reigns

You can call me up in the night 
 I will pray till you win the fight 
 We're more than friends 
 We walk together 
 Through any weather 
 We sharpen each other 
 I'll be there when you call 
 Lift you up when you fall 
 Two are better than one 
 You will pray when I'm weak 
 Help me back on my feet 
 Two are better than one 
 Two are better than one 
 When I start to cross the line 
 You just seem to read my mind 
 And then you bust me 
 Then turn around and trust me 
 Come to the rescue 
 I'll do the same for you 
 I'll be there when you call 
 Lift you up when you fall 
 Two are better than one 
 You will pray when I'm weak 
 Help me back on my feet 
 Two are better than one 
 Two are better than one 
 I don't want to go solo 
 It's always better with two 
 I just want someone to lift me up 
 To pray and help me get through 
 I'll be there when you call 
 Lift you up when you fall 
 Two are better than one 
 You will pray when I'm weak 
 Help me back on my feet 
 Two are better than one 
 Two are better than one

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Hebrews 9:14 
 I was just a young man 
 With a burning fuse 
 Headed in the wrong way 
 'Til I heard the news 
 'Bout a substitution 
 Blood shed for me 
 'Bout a grace so amazing it can make a man free 
 Now I'm rescued, pulled from the mud 
 It's all behind me, under the blood 
 Underneath the blood 
 Through the cleansing flood 
 Guilt is left behind 
 Never brought to mind 
 I'm an innocent man 
 Underneath the blood 
 Now a little older 
 I recall the past 
 Farther from me 
 Than east is from west 
 But in all the wisdom 
 That my growing brings 
 I can't seem to put down all my childish things 
 Where do I go when 
 I've missed the mark 
 And my heart starts feeling like it's stained and dark 
 Only know one way to go 
 I take it to the crimson flood 
 Underneath the blood 
 Through the cleansing flood 
 Guilt is left behind 
 Never brought to mind 
 Underneath the blood 
 Pulled up from the mud 
 Feet on solid ground 
 What was lost is found 
 I'm an innocent man 
 Underneath the blood 
 I'm an innocent man 
 Underneath the blood 
 Underneath the blood 
 Through the cleansing flood 
 Guilt is left behind 
 Never brought to mind 
 Underneat the blood 
 Pulled up from the mud 
 Feet on solid ground 
 What was lost is found 
 I'm an innocent man

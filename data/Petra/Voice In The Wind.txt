Wind may come, wind may go 
 Where it blows no one knows 
 Chill the bone, fan the fire 
 Lead the soul to hearts desire 
 There's a voice in the wind that calls your name 
 If you listen you'll never be the same 
 There's a voice in the wind that points the way 
 Gently beckons to follow and obey 
 Spirit comes, spirit goes 
 Whence it comes no one knows 
 Giving life, making new 
 Filling hearts, calling you

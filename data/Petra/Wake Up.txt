Wake up, you think you're havin' fun 
 Wake up, see what you have done 
 What do you think you are gonna do 
 When you find out what you're really goin' through 
 When there's no one else around 
 When there's no one to be found 
 But don't you be to late 
 There is no certain date 
 No, please don't hesitate 
 You might just be too late 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Lord, why don't you wake up 
 And see what's goin' on 
 Wake up, and see your time is gone

I'm rockin' with the Rock 
 Rollin' on the road that takes me to the King 
 I've been up and down your city 
 And I wish you could see all the love you need 
 Walkin' in the light every day and night 
 Livin' in the Spirit is really out of sight 
 Walkin' in the light every day and night 
 Livin' in the Spirit is really out of sight 
 I know you've given me Your Spirit 
 Peace in my heart, a new song to sing 
 I'm giving love to all of my brothers 
 And I wish you could see all the joy it brings 
 I'm rockin' with the Rock 
 Rollin' on the road that takes me to the King 
 I'm tellin' all my friends about You 
 And I wish they could see all the love You bring

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Philippians 2:2 
 Here we are gathered once again under Your Name 
 Thinking of the ways we all have caused You shame 
 But we can find consolation in the things that You said 
 We are all bound in our hearts by a common thread 
 We look to You who made us one 
 To give us strength and bring our hearts back to where we've begun 
 So together we hold all our hearts out to You 
 And we all can believe You know just what to do 
 Heal and forgive us, make us all just like new 
 Jesus, we hold our hearts out to You 
 Jesus, we hold our hearts out to You 
 Sometimes we forget what it is that brings us here 
 Sometimes we forget what it means to be sincere 
 And there are times we are bothered when we don't seem to feel 
 Then we all focus on the One who makes things real 
 We look around and we feel strong 
 We feel Your presence then we know that this is where we belong 
 And when we hold out all our lost and shattered dreams 
 You will be binding every heart with broken seams 
 With a warm and loving hand 
 You understand

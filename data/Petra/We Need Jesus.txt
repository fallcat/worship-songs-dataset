When will the world 
 See that we need Jesus? 
 If we open our eyes 
 We will all realise that he loves us 
 When will the world see that we need Jesus? 
 When our hearts are as one 
 And believe that he's the son of our God 
 The Lord is our God 
 And we shall never want 
 The Lord is our God 
 And we shall live forever 
 When we share the love of Jesus 
 See each other as he sees us 
 Then his love will see us through 
 Oh, you know his love will see us through 
 When will the world 
 See that we need Jesus? 
 When sister and brother 
 Love one another as one 
 When will the world 
 See that we need Jesus? 
 Will we ever understand 
 Jesus is the Son of man 
 We must live in the shadow of His love

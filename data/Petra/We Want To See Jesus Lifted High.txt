We want to see Jesus lifted high 
 A banner that flies across the land 
 That all men might see the truth and know 
 He is the way to heaven 
 We want to see, we want to see 
 We want to see Jesus lifted high 
 We want to see, we want to see 
 We want to see Jesus lifted high 
 Step by step, we're moving forward 
 Little by little, taking ground 
 Every prayer are for ever 
 Strongholds come tumbling down and down and down and down 
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see 
 We're gonna see Jesus lifted high 
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see 
 We're gonna see Jesus lifted high

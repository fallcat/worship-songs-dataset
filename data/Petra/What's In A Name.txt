Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Philippians 2:9-10 
 Some men called Him Rabbi, good teacher, nothing more 
 The Son of just a carpenter who taught along the shore 
 Some men called Him Master, Elijah come again 
 Some left their nets to follow Him to learn to fish for men 
 Some say He's Messiah, I Am, who's always been 
 The Baptist called Him Lamb of God who takes away our sin 
 What's in a name that the demons flee 
 What's in a name that the captives go free 
 What's in a name that every knee should bow 
 In the name of Jesus, name above all names 
 There is power and glory, forever and ever 
 Forever and ever 
 Some said Son of David returning to His throne 
 Some said He's the Son of Man with origin unknown 
 And one said He's the Son of God, the Rock on which we stand 
 The Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end 
 No other name can sound so sweet 
 No other name is so complete 
 No other name can bring release 
 The Mighty God, the Prince of Peace

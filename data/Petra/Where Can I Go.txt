I could take a plane to New York City 
 I could hitchhike all the way to L.A. 
 I could follow the sunrise tomorrow 
 But be as close to You as today 
 I'm beginning to see what You mean to me 
 I just can't get away from Your love 
 Where Can I go without Your love there to haunt me 
 I do believe You're playing to win 
 I can't understand what makes You really want me 
 But I'm feelin' like it's time to give in 
 I could climb the golden stairway to heaven 
 I could catch the crowded highway to hell 
 If I could find a place nobody has ever been 
 I bet You'd probably be there as well 
 I don't know why I've waited so long 
 Darkness is the same as the light to You 
 Daytime is the same as the night 
 When You put Your chains of love around my soul 
 I know it won't be long before I let You take control 
 I could take a submarine to Atlantis 
 I could take a flying saucer to Mars 
 I could ride on the Milky Way someday 
 But You've already numbered the stars 
 I'm beginning to hear Your voice is so near 
 Tellin' me You love me again

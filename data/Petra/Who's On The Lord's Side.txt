You've been running and running 
 Running for a long time 
 Your time is winding up 
 You better make up your mind 
 It's getting late in the evening 
 The sun is going down 
 You better get right while 
 He may be found 
 I want to know where 
 Who's on the Lord's side 
 I want to know where 
 Who's on the Lord's side 
 Where do you stand 
 Come on, come on 
 I'm on the Lord's side 
 You got to work, got to work, work while it's day 
 For the night is coming when you can't find your way 
 Oh sinner I wonder what will you do 
 You better choose this day - tomorrow's not promised to you 
 Get up if you're on the Lord's side 
 Get on your feet

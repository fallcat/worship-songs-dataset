Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Hebrews 1:3, Matthew 20:29, 6:34 
 Hearts are falling left and right 
 Children fear this planet's plight 
 Fatalistic fears abound 
 And take their toll without a sound 
 But through the vague uncertainty - comes a bold assurity 
 This world is under sovereignty - divinely ordered destiny 
 He holds this world together with the Word of His power 
 Safe within His hands - till its own appointed hour 
 He's still got the whole world in His hands - tonight 
 And only He knows where the sparrow lands - tonight 
 And nothing in this world can stop His plans - tonight 
 'Cause He's still got the whole world in His hands 
 In His hands tonight 
 Humanistic lies lament 
 The holocaust is imminent 
 Doomsday prophets in the news 
 Predicting who will light the fuse 
 The fate of His creation isn't subject to a man 
 The final consummation is according to His plan 
 He's still got you - He's still got me in His hands tonight

Why should the Father bother to call us His children?, 
 Why should the Spirit hear it when we pray?, 
 Why should the Father bother to be concerned with all our needs? 
 It's all Because of what the Son has done. 
 Once we were lost out on the Ocean with no direction or devotion, 
 Tossed about by every wind and wave, Now we are in the world not of it, 
 And we can surely rise above it, Because the Lord has risen from the grave 
 And we cry "Abba Father", "Abba Father","Abba Father", "Abba Father" 
 We cry "Abba Father", "Abba Father", "Abba Father", "Abba Father", 
 Once we were strangers from the Promise, We were doubters worse than Thomas, 
 Till the Spirit opened up our eyes, 
 Now he has offered us adoption and 
 We have taken up the option, To be His family Eternally. 
 It's all 
 Because of what the Son has done.

Everybody look there's a new bandwagon in town 
 Hop on board and let the wind carry you around 
 Seems like there's not enough to keep us busy till the Lord comes back 
 Don Quixote's gotta have another windmill to attack 
 Another witch hunt looking for evil wherever we can find it 
 Off on a tangent, hope the Lord won't mind it 
 Another witch hunt, takin' a break from all our gospel labor 
 On a crusade but we forgot our saber 
 There's a new way to spend all our energies 
 We're up in arms instead of down on our knees 
 Walkin' over dollars trying to find another dime 
 Never mind the souls 'cause we really haven't got the time 
 So send out the dogs and tally ho 
 Before we sleep tonight we've got miles to go 
 No one is safe, no stone's left unturned 
 And we won't stop until somebody gets burned 
 Bro Bro Bro Bro Bro Bro Brothers

How can, how can we who are dead to sin 
 Live any longer therein? 
 We've been, we have been called and loved and forgiven 
 Our old life is forgotten 
 Do you remember what he's called you out of? 
 Do you remember where you were? 
 Let us not take advantage of his love 
 That we forget that we have been forgiven 
 Without Him we can do nothing 
 I know, I know where I was when He found me 
 With so much confusion around me 
 He's been, He has been all that we would let Him 
 Without Him we can do nothing

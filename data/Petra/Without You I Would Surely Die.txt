Sometimes I feel like I'm all mixed up inside 
 Sometimes I feel like I wanna go run and hide 
 But then You put Your arms around me 
 And I feel Your sweet love surround me 
 Then I know just where I'm going 
 I tell You sincerely You're the sweetest person I've ever know 
 And I love You dearly You know I'd never, never let You go 
 'Cause when You put Yours arms around me 
 And I feel Your sweet love surround me 
 Then I know just where I'm going 
 You keep my head on my shoulders 
 I'm well adjusted inside 
 You are my love, You are my only life 
 Without You I would surely die 
 And there is no other that I love as much as I love You 
 I wish that my brother could love You just as much as I do 
 'Cause when You put Your arms around me 
 And I feel Your sweet love surround me 
 Then I know just where I'm going 
 There is no more doubt, there's no more knowing

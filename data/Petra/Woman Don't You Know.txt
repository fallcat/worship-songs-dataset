I know that you been scheming 
 Trying to run my head around 
 But I know all about you girl 
 You've been lost - But I've been found 
 Woman don't you know 
 You ain't gonna pull me down 
 I told you 'bout a new way 
 Of livin' life and having fun 
 I told you 'bout the Spirit 
 And walking in the light of the Son 
 Woman don't you know 
 I ain't gonna come undone 
 I told you about Salvation 
 But you don't seem to want no part 
 You've been trying to take me 
 You've been trying to steal my heart 
 Woman don't you know 
 I ain't gonna have no part

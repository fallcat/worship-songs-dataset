Life is filled with many chances 
 Some you took, and you some you blew 
 Your path in life can turn ever so quickly 
 On everything you say 
 And change with everything you do 
 I know that was then 
 There's nothing I can do about what might have been 
 Would'a, should'a, could'a done this and that 
 Don't wanna live life with another regret 
 Would'a, should'a, could'a made another choice 
 I can see more the older I get 
 Would'a, should'a, could'a said something more 
 But it's too late - there's a knock at the door 
 Would'a, should'a, could'a won't change a thing 
 The here and now is waiting 
 Would'a, should'a, could'a right now 
 We dig our pit, we make our bed 
 That's where we fall and where we lay 
 But we still have a shot to make things better 
 'Cause it ain't over yet 
 And we can get it right today 
 We can make the right choice 
 You know it's easy when you hear God's voice 
 I want to live my life not only thinking of the past 
 The future tells me that my life has not been cast 
 I want to say "I will, I did" instead of could or should 
 Gonna believe in the promise "It's all good"

I hear music coming from heaven 
 Singing a new song in my direction 
 I hear the melody, heavenly symphony 
 Feelings coming over me 
 Sets me spirit free 
 I feel like I've been born all over again 
 Like a songbird in the canyon 
 It echoes in my mind 
 Taking me farther from the memories of things I left behind 
 And it's taken me so long to hear 
 The music playing softly 
 Softly in my ear 
 Yahweh love, Yahweh love, Yahweh love 
 Yahweh love Yahweh love, Yahweh 
 Yahweh love, Yahweh love, Yahweh love 
 Yahweh love Yahweh love, Yahweh 
 I see a sign on every corner leading me astray 
 I hear a thousand voices calling for me to walk away 
 When I listen closely I can hear 
 The music playing softly 
 Softly in my ear

Words and music by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Exodus 3:14, John 8:58 
 From the top of the mountains to the bottom of the sea 
 From beginning of time through eternity 
 From burning bush to Gethsemane 
 From the Red Sea shores to the Galilee 
 You are I Am, You are I Am 
 Let the heavens rejoice in you Your majesty 
 Let the earth hear Your voice in its purity 
 From the fiery furnace to upper room 
 From the lions' den to the empty tomb 
 You have always been - You will always be 
 Yesterday, today, and through eternity 
 I will always bow my knee 
 You will never cease to be I Am 
 From the breath of life to the Living Word 
 To the broken heart when good news is heard

Words by Bob Hartman 
 Based on Psalm 18:1-6, Psalm 31 
 Moving through the shadows of uncertainty 
 Clinging to the words You said 
 Through my loneliness and fear I long to feel You near 
 But I hear another voice inside my head 
 But then the darkness is broken into 
 By inescapable light from You 
 I'm never standing alone 
 You are my rock, my fortress, my shield 
 You are my rock, let Your strength be revealed 
 My rock, my comfort, my peace 
 My salvation, my refuge, my God 
 You are my Rock 
 Through the desperate night my soul cries out to You 
 Longing just to hear Your voice 
 In the quiet solitude, I sense Your magnitude 
 I feel the strength that makes my heart rejoice 
 You are the anchor securing me 
 I'll never drift on the shifting sea 
 You are the eye of the storm 
 Through all the loneliness this world can ever bring 
 I'll take my refuge in the shadow of Your wing

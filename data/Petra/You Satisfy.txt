You Satisfy 
 You are all I seek and all I know 
 I am satisified in you alone 
 I've found nothing in this world 
 That seems so sweet 
 As your presence in a life laid at your feet 
 And my cry 
 Lord my cry 
 Is that you are good 
 And that you satisfy 
 You are all I seek and all I am 
 In you I am complete, in grace I stand 
 When I wandered far from you 
 You brought me here 
 You've brought me to the cross 
 You've brought me here 
 My delight is your faithfulness and truth 
 My desire is to quench my thirst in you

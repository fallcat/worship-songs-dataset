Look at me, I'm a castaway 
 I'm somewhere I shouldn't belong 
 I was placed here yesterday 
 And there's a man smiling at me 
 I said, 'Why am I here? 
 When You are so holy? 
 I will never hit the mark'. 
 He said, 'Yes this is true 
 But my friend, I've done it instead'. 
 Run, run, run 
 The law it beckons me 
 But gives me no limbs 
 Fly, fly, fly 
 The gospel bids to me 
 And lovingly gives me some wings 
 So I will fly 
 Held on the wind of grace 
 That teaches me when to say yes and say no 
 So I will fly 
 On eagle's wings 
 You're helping me win the prize 
 But always with love in Your eyes 
 Love in Your eyes 
 Look at me on a journey now 
 The road looks narrow ahead 
 But every time that my head falls 
 I feel a hand steadying me 
 I said, 'Teach me Lord, 
 That I may be holy 
 In silver and gold I must build'. 
 He said 'All that I've started in you 
 I'll see to the end'.

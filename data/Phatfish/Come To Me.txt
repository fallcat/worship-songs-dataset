Come to me you weary 
 Weak and heavy laden 
 Come to me and I will give you rest 
 Come if you are tired 
 Tired of the struggle 
 Come to me and I'll refresh your soul 
 Come if you are lonely 
 Come if you are grieving 
 Come to me and I will give you hope 
 For my burden is light 
 Come to me and rest today 
 Let your worriesmelt away 
 My burden is light 
 Mypeace is everlasting 
 I'll comfort you and hold you 
 Come if you are anxious 
 Scared about tomorrow 
 Come to me and I will bear your load 
 Come if you are hurting 
 Broken and alone 
 Come to me and I will be your shield 
 Come if you're regretful 
 Ashamed of your past 
 Come to me and I will wash you clean 
 Don't you know, haven't you heard 
 I'm the everlasting God? 
 I won't tire, I won't faint 
 And you're living in my grace 
 You can run, you can soar 
 Rising up on eagles wings 
 Put you hope in the King 
 And He'll renew your strength

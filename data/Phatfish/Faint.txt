When my heart is faint within me 
 And my troubles multiply 
 I will lift my hand to see you 
 Seated at the fathers side 
 You have triumphed over Satan 
 You're the first born of the grave 
 You are always interceding 
 You are able now to save 
 You are Jesus Christ, faithful One 
 Risen King, Cahmpion. 
 You deserve the highest praise, 
 The lamd of God who once was slain for our sin 
 In my heart I am persuaded 
 As the spirit testifies 
 And with glory and rejoicing 
 "Abba Father" is my cry 
 You have raised me up with Jesus 
 And in Him I am Your son 
 So I glory in Your goodness 
 In the things that You have done

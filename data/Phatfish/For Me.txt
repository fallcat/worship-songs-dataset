My God is for me 
 I know His hand is on my life 
 I have the blessing of the Father 
 A sweet assurance in my heart 
 That I'm forgiven 
 No condemnation now for me 
 In Jesus Christ I am accepted 
 I am a son and I am free 
 So tell me who can separate me from His love 
 Who can snatch me from His hand 
 Or stand against His perfect plan 
 For I am hidden now with Christ in God 
 Secure for eternity 
 Secure in His love 
 I have been lifted 
 Out of the mire to the Rock 
 I have been made alive with Jesus 
 The old has gone the new has come 
 And now I'm living 
 In all the blessing that You've won 
 Your Holy Spirit is my helper 
 I know I'll always be Your son

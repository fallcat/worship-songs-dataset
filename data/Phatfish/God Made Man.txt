God made man 
 Gave him rule over Earth and sea 
 There was friendship and harmony 
 Between creator and humanity 
 Then temptation came 
 And foolishly man disobeyed 
 From them two came into the world 
 And in his shame man could no longer stand in the presence of God 
 His thoughts became futile 
 His heart was darkened 
 And he exchanged the truth of God for a lie 
 Worship created things, rather than God himself 
 Giving over to his shameful desires 
 But God has a plan to reconcile his people back to him 
 Unfolding down through history 
 For he so lover the world 
 That he gave to man his only son and punished him instead of us. 
 Bruised for me, he was hung upon a tree 
 Mocked and cursed for all to see 
 The Lord and Saviour of humanity 
 And then the darkness came 
 Evil thought he'd won the day 
 But death could not hold onto him and on day three he rose again 
 The price was fully paid 
 But God has a plan to reconcile his people back to him 
 Unfolding down through history 
 For he so lover the world 
 That he gave to man his only son and punished him instead of us. x2

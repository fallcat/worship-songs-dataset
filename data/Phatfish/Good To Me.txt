Holy Lord I marvel at the things You've done 
 You've brought me peach 
 My heart's release 
 Every day, while all around the darkness plays 
 I know You're hand is always there guiding me 
 Where would I be without Your mercy 
 What could I do to repay to You Your gift of life 
 You have shown me things I coul not see 
 The mystery of perfect love come down to me 
 Who can I find to compare with You 
 You're so good to me 
 So I will sing 
 Gonna live for You, gonna live for You 
 Through my life You've been my faithful firend 
 I get it wrong, forget my song 
 Of love and praise for Your faultless ways 
 But every time You bring me back again

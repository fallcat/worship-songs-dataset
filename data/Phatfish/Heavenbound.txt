I am a stanger here I don't fit in I'm out of place 
 I am a citizen of heaven and it's obvious to see 
 That I belong with you 
 Don't want to settle or get too aquanted with this life 
 Got to keep on looking up, 'cause He's coming soon 
 And then I will be 
 Heavenbound, I'll be Heavenbound 
 Heavenbound, I'll be Heavenbound 
 It's not an emty hope or false relious fantasy 
 Its is a promise of my Saviour and it's where I'm going to be 
 For all eternity 
 For He will come in glory when the final trumpets sounds 
 Life as we know it will be swallowed up 
 And then I will be 
 Heavenbound, I'll be Heavenbound 
 Heavenbound, I'll be Heavenbound 
 Heavenbound, I'll be Heavenbound 
 Heavenbound, I'll be Heavenbound 
 I am a stanger here I don't fit in I'm out of place

Here I stand, covered by grace 
 Under the blood that was shed for me 
 Here I kneel, before the King upon His throne 
 Here I bow, to worship the Lord 
 Enjoying his favour on my life today 
 Knowing that we'll never be apart 
 I'm a child of God created for my Makers' pleasure 
 Chosen to enjoy Him forever 
 Granted dignity by what He says about me 
 Made in His image, precious in the eyes of my father 
 Purchased by the death of my Saviour 
 I have been given life to the full 
 Here I stand, covered by grace 
 Under the blood that was shed for me 
 Here I kneel, before the King upon His throne 
 Here I bow, to worship the Lord 
 Enjoying his favour on my life today 
 Knowing that we'll never be apart 
 In this precious place 
 I'm basking in the warmth of the sunshine 
 The whole experienced and the presence 
 Brings such joy to me and such liberty 
 Oh I'm standing firm 
 Holding fast to all you have spoken 
 Now promises none will be broken 
 I lift my faith in Jesus Christ 
 And all will believe all the lives that I heal 
 And no self-esteem whispers into my ear 
 That I'm worthless and poor, I'm lost and alone 
 At moments like that I must look to the throne 
 Here I stand, covered by grace 
 Under the blood that was shed for me 
 Here I kneel, before the King upon His throne 
 Here I bow, to worship the Lord 
 Enjoying his favour on my life today 
 Knowing that we'll never be apart

You went away 
 Yesterday 
 With something to prove 
 Set you're path 
 Sailed away 
 Far away 
 And there you entertained danger 
 Suffered at the hand of a stranger 
 Andnow you can't see a way home 
 This is not what I designed for you 
 But I'll wait for you 
 Yes I'll wait for you 
 Now looking back 
 All the times 
 You would talk to me 
 And I look 
 Out for you 
 Every day 
 But you are too ashamed 
 To lift your head up 
 Look me in the eyes and 
 Tell me that you still want me 
 I will love you whatever you have done 
 I've got a ring my daddy gave me 
 I'll put it on you finger 
 And a coat to keep you warm 
 I've got a pair ofcomfy shoes 
 You can put them on yor feet 
 And I'll prepare for us a feast

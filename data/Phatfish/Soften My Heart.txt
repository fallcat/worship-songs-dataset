Soften my heart, that I may know 
 The love You have for me 
 More than words or well worn phrases 
 Soften my heart, for love to grow 
 The love I have for You 
 That keeps my motives pure and blameless 
 Enter in 
 Come and have free reign 
 As I walk with You today 
 Risen Lord 
 Holy One 
 Overshadow me today

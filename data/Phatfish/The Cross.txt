I see You hanging there, nailed to a splintered wooden beam, 
 Drinking pain and sorrow, breathing agony. 
 And in those dark, dark hours as life drained from Your flesh and bones, 
 I know my life had it's beginning at Your cross, 
 And I thank You... 
 For the croos where You bled, 
 For the croos where You died, 
 For the cross where You've broken Satan's back, 
 For the cross where You won, 
 For the cross of victory, 
 For the cross where You paid the price for me. 
 You were my substitue in laying down Your life for mine, 
 Being cursed and bearing God's wrath for me. 
 You were cruched by my sin - Your punishment has brought me peace, 
 By the wounds You suffered I'm alive and healed. 
 And I thank You... 
 Two days in the grave and then Youn rose up from the dead. 
 Now You reign in glory, rule in righteousness 
 And I was raised up with You, free at last from all my sin, 
 Safe forever in the home of my King. 
 And I thank You... 
 I'm free at last from all my sin, safe forever with my King 
 (Repeat to fade)...

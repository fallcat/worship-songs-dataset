There is a day 
 That all creation's waiting for, 
 A day of freedom and liberation for the earth. 
 And on that day 
 The Lord will come to meet His bride, 
 And when we see Him 
 In an instant we'll be changed 
 The trumpet sounds 
 And the dead will then be raised 
 By His power, 
 Never to perish again. 
 Once only flesh, 
 Now clothed with immortality, 
 Death has now been 
 Swallowed up in victory 
 We will meet Him in the air 
 And then we will be like Him 
 For we will see Him, as He is 
 Oh yeah! 
 Then all hurt and pain will cease 
 And we'lll be with Him forever 
 And in His glory we will live 
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! 
 So lift your eyes 
 To the things as yet unseen, 
 That will remain now 
 For all eternity. 
 Though trouble's hard, 
 It's only momentary 
 And it's achieving 
 Our future glory.

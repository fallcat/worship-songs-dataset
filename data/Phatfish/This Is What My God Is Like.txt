This is what my God is like 
 He's brighter than the brightest sun 
 Fiercer than a raging sea 
 Stonger than a mighty army. 
 This is what my God is like 
 Gentler than a Mothers kiss 
 Kinder than a doubting Dad 
 Wiser than the wisest Saint. 
 Yeah 
 This is what my God is like 
 He's radiant with majesty 
 Slow to anger full of grace 
 Father of a family. 
 This is what my God is like 
 Pure and holy, hating sin 
 Jealous for His children's love 
 Patient with the prodigal. 
 I love Him, He loves me 
 I love Him, He loves me 
 This is what my God is like 
 He speaks and stars are born in space 
 Worlds and galaxies burst forth 
 By the power of His Word. 
 This is what my God is like 
 He sent His one and only son 
 And let Him die in place of us 
 Saving millions for all time 
 I love Him and He loves me 
 I love Him and He loves me 
 This is what my God is like 
 He's brighter than the brightest sun 
 Fiercer than a raging sea 
 Stronger than a mighty army. 
 This is what my God is like 
 Gentler than a Mothers kiss 
 Kinder than a doubting Dad 
 Wiser than the wisest Saint. 
 I love Him, He loves me 
 I love Him, He loves me

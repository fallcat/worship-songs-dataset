To You, King Jesus, we sing our song, 
 The First and the Last, theliving One. 
 With eyes like fire, and feet like bronze, 
 Your face shines brighter than the sun, 
 All creation speaks Your name. 
 Jesus, Son of God. 
 You stand in all authority, 
 And at Your name darkness flees. 
 Oh, Jesus, living word. 
 Reigning at the Father's right hand. 
 And You're clothed with majesty and power. 
 Tou you, King Jesus, we give our hearts. 
 For you have come to us with Your great love. 
 You suffered death, went to the grave. 
 But now You're crowned with glory. 
 All Your people speak Your name. 
 And now we stand at Your side, 
 A people chosen as Your bride. 
 You've filled us with the Spirit's power, 
 This is the hour. 
 So in Your strength I'll run this race, 
 Covered by Your daily grace. 
 Pressing on to win the prize, 
 Until the day that You return, 
 And every tribe and every tongue will sing:

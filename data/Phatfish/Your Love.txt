I come to You 
 To sit at Your feet 
 I hear You call 
 I'm longing to meet You 
 I lift my face to You 
 And catch Your eye 
 Oh how You satisfy 
 Jesus, Your love surrounds me 
 Jesus, Your love completes me 
 Now looking closer 
 I see the scars 
 Stories of love 
 You paid the greatest price 
 So that I may have life 
 Thankyou my friend 
 You're showing me once again 
 There's nothing like it 
 There's nothing like it 
 There's nothing like the love of God 
 No longer searching 
 I've found the one 
 Just touched the surface 
 I've only begun 
 This love goes deeper than any I've known 
 Jesus, Your love surrounds me 
 Jesus, Your love completes me 
 You, you, you complete me

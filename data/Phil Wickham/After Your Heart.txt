Can I have your attention 
 What are we starting here 
 Just look around you 'cause the answer is clear 
 Listen, listen 
 And hear the coming sound 
 All of the children are singing it loud 
 Let's be the revolution 
 That lives for hold nothing back, nothing back 
 We're after your heart, after your heart 
 All of the walls now, are breaking apart 
 Live like we see it, love like we mean it 
 This is the start, we're after your heart 
 Start the ascension, begin the holy climb 
 Up to where heaven and the earth collide 
 Bring your affection, all that you have inside 
 Enter the kingdom and become alive 
 'Cause love with no condition 
 It lives for holding nothing back, nothing back 
 We're after your heart, after your heart 
 All of the walls now, are breaking apart 
 Live like we see it, love like we mean it 
 This is the start, we're after your heart 
 Oh, let's go, higher and higher 
 Hear the sound of the free 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Oh, lift your soul, join with the choir 
 Sing the song, let it ring 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We're after your heart 
 Never going to stop until we reach you 
 We're after your heart, after your heart 
 All of the walls now, are breaking apart 
 Live like we see it, love like we mean it 
 This is the start, we're after your heart 
 We're after your heart 
 Never going to stop until we reach you

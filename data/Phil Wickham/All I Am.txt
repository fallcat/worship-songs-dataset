Take these hands, I know they're empty but with You they can 
 Be used for beauty in Your perfect plan, all I am is Yours 
 Take these feet, I know they stumble but You use the week 
 You use the humble, so please use me, all I am is Yours 
 I give You all my life, I'm letting it go 
 A living sacrifice, no longer my own 
 All I am is Yours, all I am is Yours 
 I give You everything to You I belong 
 Every beat of my heart, the breath in my lungs 
 All I am is Yours, all I am is Yours 
 Take this heart, set it on fire shining in the dark 
 I want to tell the world of who You are, all I am is Yours 
 I lift my hands up, God I surrender 
 All that I am for Your glory Your honour Your fame 
 I lift my hands up, God I surrender to You

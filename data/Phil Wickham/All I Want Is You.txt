We're looking love, for something to feel 
 We want something true, something that's real 
 We're holding out hope, that hope can be found 
 We all want to know what life is about 
 We all want something more 
 There's something more we're searching for 
 We all want something more 
 You're something more, You're so much more 
 You, all I ever wanted 
 You, all I ever needed 
 You, all I want is You 
 You are the light, that never will fade 
 You won't fail, You won't change 
 Every thirst You satisfy, 
 You fill up my soul, the hunger inside

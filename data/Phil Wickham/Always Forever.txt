You are the hand that catches my fall 
 You are the friend that answers my call 
 You are my day, You are my night 
 You are my love and all of my life 
 You are the love I need 
 You are the air I breathe 
 You are my love my life always forever 
 I would lay down my life 
 Just to be by Your side 
 You are my love my life always forever 
 You are the grace that covers my sin 
 You're everything the beginning and end 
 You have my soul, my heart and my mind 
 You have my love and all of my life 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, forever

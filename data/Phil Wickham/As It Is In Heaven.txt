Let my heart be a temple 
 Let that temple have a throne 
 Let the one who sits upon it 
 Be You and You alone 
 I surrender my ambitions 
 I lay down all my pride 
 That I would be Your servant 
 And You would be my God 
 Let Your will be done in me 
 Let Your kingdom come in me 
 In my life, Lord 
 Let it be as it is in hea - ven 
 Like a battle weary soldier 
 I'm lifting up my hands 
 In absolute surrender 
 My life, my will, my plans 
 And Yours will be the glory 
 The honor and the fame 
 And this will be my story 
 Lifting high Your name 
 I lift my hands, and say that I need You 
 I lift my heart, and say that I love You 
 I give my life; God, I am forever Yours 
 Let Your will be done in me 
 Let Your kingdom come in me 
 In my life, Lord 
 Let it be as it is in heaven 
 Be enthroned upon our hearts 
 Take control of every part 
 Be the King of all we are 
 O God in hea - ven 
 I lift my hands, and say that I need You 
 I lift my heart, and say that I love You 
 I give my life; oh, I am forever Yours

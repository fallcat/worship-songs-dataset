At Your Name 
 The mountains shake and crumble 
 At Your Name 
 The oceans roar and tumble 
 At Your Name, angels will bow 
 The earth will rejoice 
 Your people cry out 
 Lord of all the earth 
 We shout Your Name shout Your Name 
 Filling up the skies 
 With endless praise endless praise 
 Yahweh, Yahweh 
 We love to shout Your name oh Lord 
 At Your Name 
 The morning breaks in glory 
 At Your Name 
 Creation sings Your story 
 There is no one like our God 
 We will praise You, praise You 
 There is no one like our God 
 We will sing, we sill sing 
 Jesus You are God we will sing

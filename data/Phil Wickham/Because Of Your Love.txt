Jesus You endured my pain 
 Savior You bore all my shame 
 All because of Your love 
 All because of Your love 
 Maker of the universe 
 Broken for the sins of the earth 
 All because of Your love 
 All because of your love 
 Because of Your cross my debt is paid 
 Because of Your blood my sins are washed away 
 Now all of my life, I freely give 
 Because of Your love 
 Because of Your love I live 
 Innocence and holy King 
 You died to set the captives free 
 All because of Your love 
 Lord You gave Your life for me 
 I will live my life to you 
 All because of Your love 
 All because of Your love 
 Because of Your cross my debt is paid 
 Because of Your blood my sins are washed away 
 Now all of my life, I freely give 
 Because of Your love 
 Because of Your love I live 
 You did it for me, You did it for love 
 It's Your victory, Jesus You are enough 
 You did it for me, You did it for love 
 It's Your victory, Jesus You are enough 
 You did it for me, You did it for love 
 It's Your victory, Jesus You are enough 
 Because of Your cross my debt is paid 
 Because of Your blood my sins are washed away 
 Now all of my life, I freely give 
 Because of Your love 
 Because of Your love I live

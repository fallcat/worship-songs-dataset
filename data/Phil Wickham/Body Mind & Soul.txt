You won me over yeah you've stolen my heart 
 Your hand of mercy brought me out of the dark 
 Alive forever I am held in your arms 
 You won me over yeah you've stolen my heart 
 Singing, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 I will love you with my body, mind and soul 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 God, my heart belongs to you, alone 
 Alone, alone, God, my heart belongs to you 
 Beauty from ashes and water to wine 
 Miracle maker you have made me alive 
 My past forgiven and my future is bright 
 Beauty from ashes and water to wine 
 Singing, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 I will love you with my body, mind and soul 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 God, my heart belongs to you, yeah 
 Blessed redeemer, beautiful Savior 
 Miracle maker you have made me alive 
 Blessed redeemer, beautiful Savior 
 Miracle maker you have made me alive

Love so deep 
 You jump right in and just keep falling 
 Love so high 
 All the stars can't comprehend 
 Love so wide 
 East and west can't wrap the miles around it 
 Your love is boundless 
 Your love is boundless 
 Love so deep 
 You jump right in and just keep falling 
 Love so high 
 All the stars can't comprehend 
 Love so wide 
 East and west can't wrap the miles around it 
 Your love is boundless 
 Your love is boundless

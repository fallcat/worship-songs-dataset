Your grace is an ocean with no end in sight 
 Your love is a fountain that never runs dry 
 Every morning, Your mercy is new 
 Your calling me closer, I fall into You 
 You have all my attention 
 And I give all my affection 
 What can I say 
 You've taken my breath away 
 Your glory is shining like stars in the night 
 I'm breathing Your presence with arms open wide 
 I'm lost in You, I'm finally found 
 Never been so free when You surround, when You surround 
 You have all my attention 
 And I give all my affection 
 What can I say 
 You've taken my breath away 
 So in awe of all of Your goodness 
 I'm overcome, alive in Your presence 
 What can I say 
 You've taken my breath away 
 Taken my breath away 
 Every time that my heart beats 
 Let it beat for You 
 Every time that my soul sings 
 Let it sing for You, ooh 
 Every time that my heart beats 
 Let it beat for You 
 Every time that my soul sings 
 Let it sing for You, for You, for You 
 You have all my attention 
 And I give all my affection 
 What can I say 
 You've taken my breath away 
 God, I'm so in awe of all of Your goodness 
 I'm overcome, alive in Your presence 
 What can I say 
 You've taken my breath away 
 What can I say 
 You've taken my breath away 
 What can I say 
 You've taken my breath away

Send you're spirit and move us 
 Lord make your presence known 
 Let you're fire consume us 
 Jesus we lift our souls to you 
 In my failure and my weakness 
 Your strength is glorified 
 For your grace and your forgiveness 
 Brought me from death to life 
 In you, I'm alive in you 
 You capture my heart in all of your beauty 
 You cover my soul in all of your mercy 
 And lord I've fallen so in love with you 
 I need you, I want you, I can't live without you 
 I will praise You all my days 
 In You is all I need 
 Teach me Your will and Your ways, Jesus, I long to be with You 
 Just to be with You 
 You capture my heart in all of your beauty 
 You cover my soul in all of your mercy 
 And lord I've fallen so in love with you 
 You capture my heart in all of your beauty 
 You cover my soul in all of your mercy 
 Lord I've fallen so in love with you 
 I love you, adore you, bow down before you 
 You capture my heart in all of your beauty 
 You cover my soul in all of your mercy 
 And lord I've fallen so in love with you

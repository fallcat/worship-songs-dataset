I want to hear You say well done 
 I want to be welcomed in 
 I want to feel Your love like sunshine 
 On my resurrected skin 
 I want to hear the music play 
 I want to hear the trumpets sound 
 I want to hear You call my name 
 And watch my feet lift off the ground 
 I will run 
 Oh and I won't quit 
 Chasing Your heart 
 Just like David did 
 I'll coming running 
 Through the gates 
 Looking to Your face 
 Oh I can hardly wait 
 Until You carry my soul 
 Carry my soul away 
 When everything is said and done 
 And death has met its end 
 I want to hear You call me son 
 Be counted as a faithful friend 
 I want to see You rise like fire 
 I want to see the scars that bled 
 Oh won't you take me higher 
 The place where angels fear to tread 
 And I will run 
 Lord and I won't quit 
 Chasing Your heart 
 Just like David did 
 I'll coming running 
 Through the gates 
 Looking to Your face 
 Oh I can hardly wait 
 Until You carry my soul 
 Carry my soul away 
 And I will keep my lamplight 
 Burning in the night 
 I'll be waiting here for You 
 Watching for all Your signs 
 If I may be so bold to ask You 
 Would You lend Your ear to me 
 Oh Lord come quickly 
 And I will run 
 Lord and I won't quit 
 Chasing Your heart 
 Just like David did 
 And I'll coming running 
 Through the gates 
 Looking to Your face 
 Oh I can hardly wait 
 Until You carry my soul 
 Carry my soul away 
 Until You carry my soul 
 Carry my soul away

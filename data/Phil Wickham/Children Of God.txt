Through valleys of shadow we walk unafraid 
 There in the battle we're lifting your name 
 Standing together forever and marching on 
 Though darkness surrounds there's hope in our eyes 
 For you are our victory our joy and our prize 
 Standing together forever and marching on 
 We are believers 
 All our hope in the risen one 
 And we are soldiers 
 We're fighting with faith and love 
 And we are pilgrims 
 On the journey to reach our homes 
 Standing together 
 We are the children of God 
 Nothing can stop us for you're on our side 
 Even in dying our souls are alive 
 Standing together forever and marching on 
 We are believers 
 All our hope in the risen one 
 And we are soldiers 
 We're fighting with faith and love 
 And we are pilgrims 
 On the journey to reach our homes 
 Standing together 
 We are the children of God 
 We are the children of God 
 We are the children of God 
 We are believers 
 All our hope in the risen one 
 And we are soldiers 
 We're fighting with faith and love 
 And we are pilgrims 
 On the journey to reach our homes 
 We are standing together 
 We are the children of God 
 We are the children of God 
 We are the children of God 
 We are the children of God

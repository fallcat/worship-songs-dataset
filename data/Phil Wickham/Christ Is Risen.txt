Amazing grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 For I once was lost but now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 The prodigal is welcomed home 
 The sinner now a saint 
 For the God who died came back to life 
 And everything is changed 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 Oh, death, where is Your sting? 
 Oh, fear, where is Your power? 
 For the mighty King of kings has disarmed you 
 Delivered and redeemed 
 Eternal life resounds 
 Oh, praise His name forever 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 And all throughout eternity 
 Our song will be the same 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 And on the day You call me in 
 To Heaven's sweet embrace 
 I'll see Your scars, Your open arms 
 And the beauty of Your face 
 Through tears of joy, I'll lift my voice 
 In everlasting praise 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 Oh, death, where is Your sting? 
 Oh, fear, where is Your power? 
 For the mighty King of kings has disarmed you 
 Delivered and redeemed 
 Eternal life resounds 
 Oh, praise His name forever 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 And all throughout eternity 
 Our song will be the same 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 Jesus is alive, ooh 
 And all throughout eternity 
 Our song will be the same 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave 
 And on the day You call me in 
 To Heaven's sweet embrace 
 I'll see Your scars, Your open arms 
 And the beauty of Your face 
 Through tears of joy, I'll lift my voice 
 In everlasting praise 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is risen from the grave

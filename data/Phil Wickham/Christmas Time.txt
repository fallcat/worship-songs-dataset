A beautiful December night 
 Snow has turned this city white 
 This old town has gone to sleep 
 Save the church on 2nd Street 
 All the faithful now have come 
 To join and sing these Christmas songs 
 Let them ring, let them ring, sweet carols of a King 
 Coming down, coming down from His thrown above the clouds 
 To bring us light, yeah, to save our lives

 What a Merry Christmas morn' 
 The Savior of the world is born 
 The God of all the universe 
 Is bringing light unto the earth 
 So everybody join and sing

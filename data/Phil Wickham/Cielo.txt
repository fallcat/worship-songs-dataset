I'm walking through the bright white gates 
 Breathing in and out your grace 
 All around me melodies rise 
 That echo with the joy inside 
 So I start to sing 
 But I can't sing loud enough 
 I can't sing loud enough 
 When I'm singing for You my God 
 I can't sing loud enough 
 I can't sing loud enough 
 When I'm singing for You my God 
 With a thunder roll and a brilliant light 
 Your glory boasts and the heavens shine 
 The saints and angels stand in awe 
 Captured by the beauty of it all 
 So I fall to my knees 
 But I can't bow low enough 
 I can't bow low enough 
 At the vision of You my God 
 I can't bow low enough 
 I can't bow low enough 
 At the vision of You my God 
 I can't hold it all inside 
 I'm reaching for the One who brought me out of death and into life 
 But I can't lift my hands high enough 
 Life my hands high enough 
 When I'm reaching for You my God 
 I can't lift my hands high enough 
 Life my hands high enough 
 When I'm reaching for You my God 
 Oh I'm reaching for You my God 
 I'm reaching for You 
 I'm reaching for You 
 I'm reaching for You my God

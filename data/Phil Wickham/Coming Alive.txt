I see Your banner above, lifted over our heads 
 It's waving in the sky and it's stained in red 
 From the far away hills comes a voice in the night 
 It's ringing in our hearts like a battle cry 
 Now we're coming alive 
 We're coming alive 
 Open your hearts 
 Take what's inside, let it go 
 We're speaking out for a change, but words are never enough 
 We could be the hands and the feet of Love 
 You need Love 
 Now we're coming alive 
 We're coming alive 
 Open your hearts 
 Take what's inside, let it go 
 Wake up from your sleeping 
 There's something to believe in 
 The only way to Love is to give yourself 
 Oh give yourself 
 Now we're coming alive 
 We're coming alive 
 So open your hearts 
 Take what's inside 
 Coming alive 
 We're coming alive 
 Open your hearts 
 Take what's inside 
 Open your hearts 
 Take what's inside 
 Open your hearts 
 Take what's inside and let it go

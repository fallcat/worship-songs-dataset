You raise me beyond the skies, into a city of eternal light 
 Looking down on the stars, I fly into heaven, caught up in your arms 
 I Breathe Your fragrance, taste your goodness, 
 Crumble to pieces 
 Into Your love 
 In Your presence all my existence 
 Crumbles to pieces 
 Into Your love 
 I'm speechless what can I say 
 Words become tears 
 As You wipe them away 
 All my kisses and crowns at your feet 
 Fire of heaven burn love over me 
 It's such a beautiful story 
 I'm face to face with the King of glory 
 You rescued someone unworthy, I know this is love

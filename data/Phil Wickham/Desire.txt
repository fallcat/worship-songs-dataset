I'm running through the gates of love as fast as I can 
 I can wait to see You, I'm a desperate man 
 You made the light and sent it down 
 To show us who You are 
 Now it's bursting out my heart 
 My desire is burning like a million stars 
 And I'll keep reaching out, reaching out for You 
 My desire is burning with the fire you sparked 
 And I'll keep reaching out, reaching out for You 
 I'd be nothing without you, yeah I would die 
 If I didn't have Your hand, if I couldn't look into Your eyes 
 Jesus, if Your love's the fuel 
 Then I'm the desperate flame 
 That's screaming out Your name 
 This is glory rising over a new horizon 
 I see Your love, I feel Your smile 
 You're in my heart and I will run with all I have to You

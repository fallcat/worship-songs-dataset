The fullness of Your grace is here with me 
 The richness of Your beauty's all I see 
 The brightness of Your glory has arrived 
 In Your presence God, I'm completely satisfied 
 For You I sing I dance 
 Rejoice in this divine romance 
 Lift my heart and my hands 
 To show my love, to show my love 
 A deep deep flood, an Ocean flows from You 
 Of deep deep love, yeah it's filling up the room 
 Your innocent blood, has washed my guilty life 
 In Your presence God I'm completely satisfied

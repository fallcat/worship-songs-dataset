When the first light brightened the dark 
 Before the breaking of the human heart 
 There was You and there was me 
 Innocence was all I knew 
 'Cause all I had to know was You 
 We were running underneath the trees 
 I want to see You face to face 
 Where being in Your arms is the permanent state 
 I want it like it was back then 
 I want to be in Eden 
 I remember how You called my name 
 And I would meet You at the garden gate 
 How the glory of Your love would shine 
 And I remember when the stars were young 
 You breathed life into my lungs 
 Oh I never felt so alive 
 I want to see You face to face 
 Where being in Your arms is the permanent state 
 I want it like it was back then 
 I want to be in Eden 
 To be naked and unashamed 
 In a sweet downpour of innocent rain 
 I want it like it was back then 
 I want to be in Eden 
 Where my eyes can see the colors of glory 
 My hands can reach the heaven before me 
 Oh my God I want to be there with You 
 Where our hearts will beat with joy together 
 And love will reign forever and ever 
 Oh my God I want to be there with You 
 I want to see You face to face 
 Where being in Your arms is the permanent state 
 I want it like it was back then 
 I want to be in Eden 
 To be naked and unashamed 
 In a sweet downpour of innocent rain 
 I want it like it was back then 
 I want to be in Eden

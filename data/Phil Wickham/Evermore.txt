Of the Father's love begotten 
 'Ere the world began to be 
 He the source of all that has been 
 And all the future years will see 
 Evermore, evermore 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 Humble King, Sovereign Lord 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 Oh, that birth forever blessed 
 When the chosen virgin go 
 By the Holy Ghost conceiving 
 Bore the Savior of our world 
 Evermore, evermore 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 Humble King, Sovereign Lord 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 He is found in human fashion 
 Death and sorrow here to know 
 That the race of Adam's children 
 Doomed by law to endless woe 
 Need not henceforth die and perish 
 In the dreadful gulf below 
 But forever rest in beauty 
 In the lights of Heaven's glow 
 Evermore, evermore 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 Humble King, Sovereign Lord 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 And evermore 
 He shall reign forevermore 
 Humble King, Sovereign Lord 
 He shall reign forevermore, forevermore

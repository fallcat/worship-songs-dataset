I look up towards the sky 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Your presence is where I hide 
 Above every fear I rise 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 And you'll never leave my side 
 Through fire or flood 
 Through wind and the waves 
 I follow your voice through the darkest of days 
 Whatever may come 
 You carry me through 
 Oh, you are the One I choose 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 I walk with you on the waves 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 You're with me, I know I'm safe 
 Completely you captivate 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 I trust every word you say 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Whom shall I fear for you are with me 
 Whom shall I fear, you are by my side 
 You are for me, who can stand against me 
 God, on you I fix my eyes 
 Whom shall I fear for you are with me 
 Whom shall I fear, you are by my side 
 You are for me, who can stand against me 
 God, I fix my eyes 
 Through fire or flood 
 Through wind and the waves 
 I follow your voice through the darkest of days 
 Whatever may come 
 You carry me through 
 Oh, you are the One I choose 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Eyes fixed on you 
 Whom shall I fear for you are with me 
 Whom shall I fear, you are by my side 
 You are for me, who can stand against me 
 God, on you I fix my eyes 
 Whom shall I fear for you are with me 
 Whom shall I fear, you are by my side 
 You are for me, who can stand against me 
 God, on you I fix my eyes

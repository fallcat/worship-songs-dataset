Oh who am I that Your merciful eyes should fall on me 
 A sinner a fool, who doesn't deserve You 
 And what am I that you'd offer Your life and die for me 
 What can I do, I'm nothing without You, I'm nothing without You 
 I'm nothing without You my love, my saving love 
 So I fall into You, I'm desperate and weak 
 Crying out from my heart, take all of me 
 How can it be that the heart of my God would long for me 
 For all that You do, Jesus I love You, I'll Always Love You 
 Jesus I love You with all of my heart 
 Maker of sun and moon and stars 
 I throw myself into Your arms, into Your arms

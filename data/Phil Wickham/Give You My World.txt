There is a love that can't be imagined 
 It comes from the Father of Lights to my soul 
 It overcomes the darkness that I used to hide in 
 It covers me and makes me whole 
 I want to give You my world 
 To reveal all I am 
 And all I've become 
 I want to give You my world 
 To surrender my life 
 And all that is in me 
 To You 
 There is a peace that can't be contained 
 It burrows its way to the depths of my soul 
 It changes my life, my entire being 
 It covers me it makes me whole

Come and see His glory, come just as You are 
 Come and hear the story of His heart 
 God so loved His children, He gave His only son 
 That we might be forgiven death has been overcome 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 You are the God of Our Salvation 
 You have conquered, You have risen 
 You are the God of our Salvation 
 Come You tired and weary, come just as You are 
 Come and let His mercy heal Your heart 
 God so loved His children, He gave His only son 
 That we might be forgiven, death has been overcome 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord our God 
 Mighty King of Glory, You have rescued us

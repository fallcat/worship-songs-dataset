The sky is grey and the light is far 
 The sea is a rage within my heart 
 I turn my sight to the crashing waves 
 I cry in the night just to be saved 
 I need eyes to be my guide 
 I need a voice that's louder than mine 
 I need hope I need You 
 'Cause I can't do this alone 
 Grace I call Your name 
 Oh won't Your smile fall over me 
 I'm cracked and dry on hands and knees 
 Oh sweet grace rain down on me I need You grace 
 I pray for dawn a new day to live 
 I pray for mercy only Jesus gives 
 Though darkness falls and a million cry 
 I believe over all there's a greater light shining for us 
 Come down and save me

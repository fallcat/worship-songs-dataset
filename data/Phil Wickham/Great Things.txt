Come let us worship our King 
 Come let us bow at His feet 
 He has done great things 
 See what our Savior has done 
 See how His love overcomes 
 He has done great things 
 He has done great things 
 Oh, hero of Heaven, You conquer the grave 
 You free every captive and break every chain 
 Oh God, You have done great things 
 We dance in Your freedom, awakened to life 
 Oh Jesus, our Savior, Your name lifted high 
 Oh God, You have done great things 
 You've been faithful through every storm 
 You'll be faithful forevermore 
 You have done great things 
 And I know You will do it again 
 For Your promise is "Yes and amen" 
 You will do great things 
 God, You do great things 
 Oh, hero of Heaven, You conquer the grave 
 You free every captive and break every chain 
 Oh God, You have done great things 
 We dance in Your freedom, awakened to life 
 Oh Jesus, our Savior, Your name lifted high 
 Oh God, You have done great things 
 Hallelujah God, above it all 
 Hallelujah God, unshakable 
 Hallelujah, You have done great things 
 Hallelujah God, above it all 
 Hallelujah God, unshakable 
 Hallelujah, You have done great things 
 You've done great things 
 Oh, hero of Heaven, You conquer the grave 
 You free every captive and break every chain 
 Oh God, You have done great things 
 We dance in Your freedom, awakened to life 
 Oh Jesus, our Savior, Your name lifted high 
 Oh God, You have done great things 
 You have done great things 
 Oh God, You do great things

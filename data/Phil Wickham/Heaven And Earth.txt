This is the line we're choosing now to cross 
 Between heaven and earth, heaven and earth 
 You're wiping away the tears to start to drop 
 From my face, from my face 
 I'm climbing the fences 
 I'm crossing the seas 
 I'll cover the distance 
 I just want You to shine on me 
 My beating heart is bursting out my skin 
 To go further up, and further in 
 Whatever it takes to bring me somewhere higher 
 Be it rain, or be it fire 
 I'm climbing the fences 
 I'm crossing the seas 
 I'll cover the distance 
 I just want You to shine on me 
 I'm laying down my life 
 'Cause I know what You're worth 
 I'm crossing the great line between heaven and earth 
 Between heaven and earth 
 I hear You calling me and I come running 
 Ooh I've fallen into love and nothing will stop me 
 Oh I hear You calling me and I come running 
 I'm climbing the fences 
 I'm crossing the seas 
 I'll cover the distance 
 I just want You to shine on me 
 I'm laying down my life 
 'Cause I know what You're worth 
 I'm crossing the great line between heaven and earth 
 Between heaven and earth 
 We're gonna make it 
 We're gonna make it 
 Oh 
 I hear You calling me and I come running 
 Ooh I've fallen into love and nothing will stop me 
 Oh I hear You calling me and I come running 
 To You, to You, to You

Open our eyes, Lord let us see 
 All that You are all that You mean 
 Open our ears, Lord let us hear 
 All that You are, be loud and clear, please be near 
 As our praises rise, may Your presence fall 
 Heaven, Heaven fall down 
 Spirit, Spirit Pour out, on us all now, 
 Heaven Fall down 
 Come Jesus come, come like the wind 
 Fill up this place, we welcome You in 
 Come Jesus come, come like the rain 
 Open the sky, show us Your face, oh Lord we wait 
 We're crying out in desperation 
 Waiting now in expectation 
 Crying out in desperation for You

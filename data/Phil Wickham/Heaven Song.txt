You wrote a letter and You signed Your name 
 I read every word of it page by page 
 You said that You’d be coming 
 Coming for me soon 
 Oh my God, I’ll be ready for You 
 I want to run on greener pastures 
 I want to dance on higher hills 
 I want to drink from sweeter waters 
 In the misty morning chill 
 And my soul is getting restless 
 For the place where I belong 
 I can’t wait to join the angels and sing 
 My heaven song 
 I hear Your voice and I catch my breath 
 "Well done, my child, enter in and rest" 
 Tears of joy roll down my cheek 
 It’s beautiful beyond my wildest dreams 
 I want to run on greener pastures 
 I want to dance on higher hills 
 I want to drink from sweeter waters 
 In the misty morning chill 
 And my soul is getting restless 
 For the place where I belong 
 I can’t wait to join the angels and sing 
 I want to run on greener pastures 
 I want to dance on higher hills 
 I want to drink from sweeter waters 
 In the misty morning chill 
 And my soul is getting restless 
 For the place where I belong 
 I can’t wait to join the angels and sing 
 No, I can't wait to join the angels and sing 
 My heaven song

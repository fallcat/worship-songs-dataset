Your mercy falls with the rain 
 Your powers displayed in the wild ocean 
 Your presence will always remain 
 Jesus your love reaches to the heavens 
 You are God, high above the Earth 
 Angels sing for You 
 Mountains melt at the sound of Your name 
 Oceans roar for You 
 All of creation gives You praise 
 You are God, high above the Earth 
 You are God 
 Jesus You're all that I need 
 Here is my life come and take it from me 
 Jesus You make me complete 
 With You at my side I can know no boundaries 
 You are God, high above the earth 
 Angels sing for You 
 Mountains melt at the sound of Your name 
 Oceans roar for You 
 All of creation gives You praise 
 You are God, high above the Earth 
 High above the Earth 
 So high above me, high above me 
 Oh the angels sing for You 
 The mountains melt at the sound of Your name 
 The oceans roar for You 
 And all of creation gives You praise 
 The angels sing for You 
 The mountains melt at the sound of Your name 
 The oceans roar for You 
 And all of creation gives You praise 
 You are God 
 High above the Earth 
 You are God, high above the Earth 
 Halleluiah, Halleluiah

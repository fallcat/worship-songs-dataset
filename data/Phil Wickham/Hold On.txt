There is a battle in the distance 
 I see it flashing in the sky 
 It's gonna be a long long night 
 All that was holding you together 
 Is crumbling apart 
 And left you with an aching heart 
 Take my hand 
 Here I AM 
 Love is gonna make it right 
 Just hold on, just hold on 
 With mercy in the morning light 
 When you're weak, love is strong 
 Hold on 
 There is a river in the desert 
 I feel the wind's about to change 
 And you won't ever be the same 
 I'm gonna carry you through fire 
 I'm gonna hold you in the rain 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 Take My hand 
 Here I AM 
 Love is gonna make it right 
 Just hold on, just hold on 
 With mercy in the morning light 
 When you're weak, love is strong 
 Hold on 
 Everybody lift your eyes 
 Morning light has finally come 
 And Love is gonna make it right 
 Just hold on, just hold on 
 With mercy in the morning light 
 When you're weak, love is strong 
 Hold on

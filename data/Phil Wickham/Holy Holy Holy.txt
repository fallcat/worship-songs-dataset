Lightning breaks around Your throne 
 Streams of Glory bursting from your robe 
 You are the God in Heaven 
 Voices sing Your endless praise 
 All who see you bow for countless days 
 You are the God in heaven 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord, God almighty 
 Worthy Worthy, Worthy is the Lamb 
 The only one who was and is and will come 
 Fire burns inside Your eyes 
 Unseen colors circle in the sky 
 You are God in Heaven 
 Everything your hand has saved 
 Gathers here to sing your endless praise 
 You are the God in heaven 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord, God almighty 
 Worthy Worthy, Worthy is the Lamb, the King of Glory 
 Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord, God almighty 
 Worthy Worthy, Worthy is the Lamb, 
 The only one who was and is and will come 
 Who was and is and will come to us

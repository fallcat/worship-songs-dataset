We have come 
 And now we will wait 
 For Your love to move 
 For Your light to break 
 Start a movement here 
 As we call Your Name 
 Let Your glory fall 
 Like a holy rain 
 Dead arise 
 Hearts be awakened 
 In this life 
 Earth will be shaken 
 Oh, Oh, yeah! 
 God who reigns over earth and sky 
 Flood this world with Your holy light 
 Start a fire that will never die 
 Flood this world with Your holy light 
 Every knee will bow 
 Every eye will see 
 Everyone will shout 
 Jesus Christ is King 
 Slave run free 
 Chains be broken 
 Darkness flee 
 Eyes be open 
 Oh, oh, yeah, yeah! 
 God who reigns over earth and sky 
 Flood this world with Your holy light 
 Start a fire that will never die 
 Flood this world with Your holy light 
 Holy light - shine Your light 
 There's fire in our eye 
 It's burning bright for You 
 Bring these dead bones back to life 
 Flood this world with light 
 God who reigns over earth and sky 
 Flood this world with Your holy light 
 Start a fire that will never die 
 Flood this world with Your holy light 
 Flood this world with Your holy light

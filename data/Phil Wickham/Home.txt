Come riding on a rushing wind 
 Blow through our hair and touch our skin 
 I want to feel you now like I felt you then 
 Strip away my calloused heart 
 Set your arrow at your mark 
 Can you take me back to where you are 
 Can you take me back to where you are 
 Father, I'm running 
 Father, I'm coming home 
 'Cause I cannot go on 
 Your child is running 
 Father, I'm running home 
 Back where I belong 
 I know you've heard this all before 
 When I'm down and crying on the floor 
 Singing, "I want you and nothing more" 
 But I'm breaking in my heart tonight 
 I've tried to stand, I've tried to fight 
 But I cannot see without your light 
 No I cannot breathe without you 
 When I saw you I was ashamed 
 You were pure and I was stained 
 But you ran to me and you called my name 
 There were tears of joy upon your face

From the darkness, I called Your name 
 Into darkness, Your mercy came 
 You called me out, lifted me up 
 How great is Your love 
 You bore my weakness, You took my shame 
 Buried my burdens in fields of grace 
 You called me out, lifted me up 
 How great is Your love 
 From the heights of heaven, You stepped down to earth 
 Innocent perfection, gave Your life for us 
 We are amazed, we stand in awe 
 For we have been changed by the power of the cross 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love for us 
 In Your kindness, You lead me home 
 In Your presence, where I belong 
 You called me out, lifted me up 
 How great is Your love 
 From the heights of heaven, You stepped down to earth 
 Innocent perfection, gave Your life for us 
 And we are amazed, we stand in awe 
 For we have been changed by the power of the cross 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love for us 
 How great is Your love for us 
 There has never been, there will never be 
 A God like You, a love so true 
 There has never been, and there will never be 
 A God like You, a love so true 
 There has never been, and there will never be 
 A God like You, a love so true 
 There has never been, no, there will never be 
 A God like You, a love so true! 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love for us 
 And how great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love 
 How great, how great, how great is Your love for us! 
 How great is Your love for us

 What are the chances of ever knowing You? 
 Oh God of creation 
 What would have happened if I have never followed You? 
 Oh lord of Salvation 
 But this is how we turned out 
 This is how we turned out 
 Everyday you greet me with the beauty of the dawn 
 My faithful companion 
 Your mercies in the morning your glory's in the sun 
 My father in heaven 
 You know how I will turn out 
 You know how I will turn out 
 You're the hope of my life 
 You're the God of my peace 
 You're the light to my soul 
 The very reason I breathe 
 I will walk in Your love 
 I will run in Your grace 
 I live to worship You 
 You make me turn 
 You are the reason for every breath I take 
 Strength in my weakness 
 You have forgiven every one of my mistakes 
 Meekness 
 This is how we turned out 
 You know how I will turn out 
 I live to worship you 
 I live to worship you 
 You make me turn 
 Oh You make me turn out...

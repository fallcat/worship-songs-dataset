Mercy falls from Your heart down on me 
 Glory streams from Your face so lovely 
 A million words could not describe 
 How marvelous Your perfect light 
 I adore You 
 I will sing it with all my heart 
 I adore You 
 I love everything You are 
 That my heart, beats to the rhythm of Your heart 
 That my eyes focus on Your beautiful eyes 
 A million tongues could not express 
 How beautiful Your holiness 
 My life is yours and will be forever 
 My love is yours

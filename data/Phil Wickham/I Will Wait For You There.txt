I will wait for You there 
 Down on my knees where I met You 
 Give You all of my cares 
 Find a grace to hold onto now 
 I'm calling for You 
 I will wait for You there 
 Far from the world and it's violence 
 It left broken and bare 
 I need to hear You in the silence now 
 I'm calling for You 
 And with outstretched arms 
 I will sing out melodies 
 And my beating heart 
 Will pour out a symphony 
 Hallelujah's in the morning 
 Hallelujah's in the night 
 I will wait for you as long as I have life 
 I will wait for You there 
 Down On my knees where I met you 
 Cause life is a war fought with tears 
 But You are the strength I hold onto now 
 I'm calling for you

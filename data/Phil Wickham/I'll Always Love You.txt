In the world that is falling apart I have found my hope 
 He's the Power that brightens the stars and brought to life my soul 
 Now I'll calling from rooftops shouting from mountain peaks 
 You're everything to me 
 Forever I will tell You 
 Yeah I'll scream until it hurts 
 That I can't live without You 
 You are heaven, I am earth 
 And even from the moment that You saved my life I knew 
 That I'll always love You 
 Hallelujah the battle is won, let the church bells ring 
 Hallelujah, salvation is come and it came for me 
 What was lost, now is found and the heart that was bound now is free 
 Your grace amazes me 
 Forever I will tell You 
 Yeah I'll scream until it hurts 
 That I can't live without You 
 You are heaven, I am earth 
 And even from the moment that You saved my life I knew 
 That I'll always love You 
 I'll always love You 
 Forever I will tell You 
 Yeah I'll scream until it hurts 
 That I can't live without You 
 You are heaven, I am earth 
 And even from the moment that You saved my life I knew 
 Forever I will tell You 
 Yeah I'll scream until it hurts 
 That I can't live without You 
 You are heaven, I am earth 
 And even from the moment that You saved my life I knew 
 That I'll always love You

I have looked you in the eyes 
 I have seen the tears you cried 
 I have heard you question why 
 You are here 
 There is a reason, there's a plan 
 There is a God Who understands 
 He's got your life inside His hands 
 Have no fear, 'cause He says 
 In all your hurt, in all your pain 
 I'll never leave, I won't forsake 
 You're my child and I'm your God 
 Come and rest in my love 
 I know this road is steep 
 And I know you're tired and weak 
 But the God of perfect peace 
 Is right here 
 He is the shelter from the storm 
 He is a rock, firm and secure 
 He is hope forever more 
 Have no fear, 'cause He says 
 In all your hurt, in all your pain 
 I'll never leave, I won't forsake 
 You're my child and I'm your God 
 Come and rest in my love 
 When everything seems out of control 
 I'm holding on, I won't let go 
 You're my child and I'm your God 
 Come and rest in my love 
 There is hope tonight 
 There is everlasting life 
 Dry away your tears 
 'Cause the morning sun will rise 
 Love will never fail 
 He will never fail, he says 
 In all your hurt, in all your pain 
 I'll never leave, I won't forsake 
 You're my child and I'm your God 
 Come and rest in my love 
 When everything seems out of control 
 I'm holding on, I won't let go 
 You're my child and I'm your God 
 Come and rest in my love 
 In my love 
 In my love

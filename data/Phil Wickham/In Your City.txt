Oh, the glorious day when we arrive 
 And heaven's gates are open wide 
 All our fear and pain will fade away 
 When we see You face to face 
 Our great and awesome King 
 You will reign in brilliant light 
 Forever glorified in Your city 
 And we, Your daughters and Your sons 
 Will see Your kingdom come in Your city 
 Love will reign and joy will have no end 
 When the cites go marching in 
 God we pray that You'd come soon 
 'Cause we will wait to be with You 
 Our great and awesome King 
 You will reign in brilliant light 
 Forever glorified in Your city 
 And we, Your daughters and Your sons 
 Will see Your kingdom come in Your city 
 When we've been there for ten thousand years 
 Our song will be the same 
 Praise the One who has brought us here 
 Jesus is His name, Jesus is His name 
 You will reign in brilliant light 
 Forever glorified in Your city 
 We, Your daughters and Your sons 
 Will see the kingdom come in Your city 
 My city 
 This is Your city, my city

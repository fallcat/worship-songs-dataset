Jesus Lord of Heaven 
 I do not deserve 
 The grace that You have given 
 And the promise of Your Word 
 Lord I stand in wonder 
 Of the sacrifice You made 
 With mercy beyond measure 
 My debt You freely paid 
 Your love is deeper than any ocean 
 Higher than the heavens 
 Reaches beyond the stars in the sky 
 Jesus, Your love has no bounds 
 Jesus, Your love has no bounds 
 Your love is deep, Your love is wide 
 Your love is great, Your love is high 
 Your love is all we ever need 
 Your love is all we ever need

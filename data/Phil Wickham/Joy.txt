You heard my cry for mercy, You heard my cry for help 
 You turned Your ear to hear me, to save me from myself 
 When I think of all You've done, my heart is overcome with 
 Joy, Joy, unending Joy always joy will remain 
 Joy, Joy, I sing for Joy, always forever I'll stay in Your joy 
 The chains have all been broken, the walls have all come down 
 And here I stand forgiven, in this grace that I have found 
 My heart will sing, my heart will sing for joy 
 Forever I'll sing, forever I'll sing for joy

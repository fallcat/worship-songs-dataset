How great the chasm that lay between us 
 How high the mountain I could not climb 
 In desperation, I turned to heaven 
 And spoke Your name into the night 
 Then through the darkness, Your loving-kindness 
 Tore through the shadows of my soul 
 The work is Ô¨Ånished, the end is written 
 Jesus Christ, my living hope 
 Who could imagine so great a mercy? 
 What heart could fathom such boundless grace? 
 The God of ages stepped down from glory 
 To wear my sin and bear my shame 
 The cross has spoken, I am forgiven 
 The King of kings calls me His own 
 Beautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever 
 Jesus Christ, my living hope 
 Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free 
 Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me 
 You have broken every chain 
 There's salvation in Your name 
 Jesus Christ, my living hope 
 Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free 
 Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me 
 You have broken every chain 
 There's salvation in Your name 
 Jesus Christ, my living hope 
 Then came the morning that sealed the promise 
 Your buried body began to breathe 
 Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion 
 Declared the grave has no claim on me 
 Then came the morning that sealed the promise 
 Your buried body began to breathe 
 Out of the silence, the Roaring Lion 
 Declared the grave has no claim on me 
 Jesus, Yours is the victory, whoa! 
 Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free 
 Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me 
 You have broken every chain 
 There's salvation in Your name 
 Jesus Christ, my living hope 
 Hallelujah, praise the One who set me free 
 Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me 
 You have broken every chain 
 There's salvation in Your name 
 Jesus Christ, my living hope 
 Jesus Christ, my living hope 
 Oh God, You are my living hope

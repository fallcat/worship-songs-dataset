You are the Bread of Life 
 Your words can satisfy 
 My every need 
 My cup cannot run dry 
 Your water flows within me 
 Your love has satisfied 
 My every need 
 Marvelous and holy 
 King upon the cross 
 I will serve You only, 
 Make my life Your own 
 I'll follow You forever 
 Give You all my love 
 Only You are God 
 My true and faithful friend 
 I cast my cares upon You 
 Your mercy draws me in, 
 Jesus 
 The mighty rushing wind 
 Brings me into Your presence 
 I call Your name again, 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Closing 
 Only You are God 
 Only You are God

Made from the dust and breathed into life 
 He stood unashamed with a fire in His eyes 
 The image of God walking upon the world 
 All of the earth was under His feet 
 Except for the fruit from a forbidden tree 
 He took a taste and that's how he breaks the world 
 He cried Mercy, Mercy 
 He broke the whole world with the fruit from a tree 
 Have mercy 
 Heaven to Earth came down from on high 
 With Hope in His name and a fire in His eyes 
 The fullness of God walking upon the world 
 He said He was love then proved it with blood 
 And rose from the dead to prove He was God 
 And that's what it takes for one man to save the world 
 Oh such Mercy, Mercy 
 He saved the whole world when He hung on a tree 
 Such mercy 
 Now here inside of our skin and bones 
 Heaven above is making it's home 
 The kingdom of God living upon the world 
 To love like He loves and give like he gives 
 To tell the story that makes dead men live 
 And that's what it takes if we're gonna change the world 
 Mercy, Mercy 
 Your love is a song and You sing over me 
 Mercy

Look, the road is narrow and hard to find 
 With secret battles inside our minds 
 Who can last 
 God we need your strength to find 
 Your light to guide us through the night 
 You're our only chance 
 Messiah, Messiah, Messiah save us 
 Run, I want to run to your open hand 
 But father I can barely stand 
 On my own 
 Now, like the children of Abraham 
 We're reaching out for the promised land 
 For our home 
 You are our only hope 
 You are our only hope 
 You are our only hope

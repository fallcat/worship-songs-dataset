Close my eyes, I'm trying to listen 
 Oh 'cause it's been so long since I've heard you speak 
 Send your love, cover over the distance 
 Between You and between me 
 Oh how long must I wait for my love 
 'Cause I need You oh I need You 
 My heart is bursting and breaking apart 
 For my love 
 Blind my eyes, I'm looking to heaven 
 Holding all Your promises against my chest 
 I offer up the life I've been given 
 Till my last breath 
 Your coming is as sure as the sun is rising 
 Here comes the day it's breaking in my heart 
 Your children are running to you

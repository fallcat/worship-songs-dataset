 In the desert You're the river 
 An ever flowing stream of life 
 In the battle You're the victor

 A holy flame for all to see

 My all in all 
 Jesus, my all in all 
 In the tempest You're the shelter 
 And I will hide beneath Your wings 
 Hallelujah what a Savior 
 My all, my everything

 You are my reason 
 You are my hope you are my joy 
 You are my passion 
 My all in all

 My all in all 
 Jesus, my all in all 
 Your name be high and lifted up 
 Jesus, Your name be high and lifted up 
 Jesus, Your name be high and lifted up 
 In all the earth, in all the earth 
 You are my life you are my love 
 You are my reason 
 You are my hope you are my joy

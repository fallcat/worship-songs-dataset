Here in the Quiet speak to me now 
 My ears are open to 
 Your gentle sweet whispering 
 Break down the door, come inside 
 Shine down Your bright light 
 I need a lamp for my feet, I need a lamp for my feet 
 I want to hear the thunder of who You are 
 To be captured inside the wonder of who You are 
 I want to live I want to breathe 
 To search out Your heart and all of Your mysteries 
 You were the first and You'll be the end 
 Time cannot hold You down 
 Why save a wretch like me? 
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard 
 No heart could fully know 
 All of Your mystery 
 Your glory burns in the stars 
 Shine down your light let it burn in my heart 
 Bring me to glory, bring me to you 
 Lord it's your heart that I will hold onto 
 Your glory burns in the stars 
 Shine down Your light let me know who You are 
 Jesus, Your glory burns in the stars 
 Shine down Your light, let me see You, let me see You

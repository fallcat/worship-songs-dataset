O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant 
 O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem 
 Come and behold Him, born the King of angels 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord 
 Then the angel said to them 
 Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy 
 Which will be to all people 
 For there is born to you this day in the city of David 
 A Savior, who is Christ the Lord 
 And this will be a sign to you 
 You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger 
 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude 
 Of the heavenly host praising God and saying 
 Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill toward men 
 Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation 
 Sing all ye citizens of heaven above 
 Glory to God, glory in the highest 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord 
 Christ the Lord 
 Christ the Lord 
 Hail, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning 
 Jesus, to Thee be all glory given 
 Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him 
 O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

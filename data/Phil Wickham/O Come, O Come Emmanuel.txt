O come, O come, Emmanuel 
 And ransom captive Israel 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the Son of God appear 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to Thee, O Israel 
 O come, Thou day-spring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by Thine advent here 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to Thee, O Israel 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to Thee, O Israel 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to Thee, O Israel

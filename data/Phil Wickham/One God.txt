Mighty Creator You give us life 
 Wonderful Saviour from death You rise 
 Glory and honour belong to You alone 
 There's only 
 One God who can make the stars 
 One God who saves our hearts 
 One God You reign over all 
 There's only 
 One God who can set us free 
 One God alive in me 
 One God You reign over all 
 Father of mercy You break the chains 
 Now there is victory in Jesus name 
 Glory and honour belong to You alone 
 You alone are God, You reign forever

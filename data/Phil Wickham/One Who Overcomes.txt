When we were trapped within our sin 
 When we trusted ourselves 
 When we were blinded by our shame and guilt 
 Overwhelmed 
 When we were searching for our worth 
 You died and gave yourself 
 You rose and brought a hope so real 
 And we're overwhelmed 
 We sing to the One who overcomes 
 To the One who saves us from our sin 
 And heals what's broken 
 Sing to the One who rescues all 
 We will trust a love so perfectly 
 Complete in Him 
 We live within a world that fails 
 With pain we can't control 
 You sustain us with a love that knows 
 And we're overwhelmed 
 We sing to the One who overcomes 
 To the One who saves us from our sin 
 And heals what's broken 
 Sing to the One who rescues all 
 We will trust a love so perfectly 
 Complete in Him 
 We sing for the rescue He's brought us 
 We sing for the kingdom right here 
 We sing for the hope in redemption 
 He has overcome, He has overcome 
 We sing to the One who overcomes 
 To the One who saves us from our sin 
 And He heals what's broken 
 Sing to the One who rescues all 
 We will trust a love so perfectly 
 Complete in Him 
 He has overcome, He has overcome 
 He has overcome, He has overcome

When You move, hearts awaken 
 Broken lives will be redeemed 
 Here and now, as in Heaven 
 Let revival be released 
 Hear our cry 
 Heal our land 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 What You've done before 
 You can do again 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 God of grace, God of salvation 
 We are desperate on our knees 
 You can save this generation 
 Let revival be released 
 Hear our cry 
 Heal our land 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 What You've done before 
 You can do again 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 Like a river running through the barren land 
 Let mercy flow, revive us again 
 Move in power, save us by Your mighty hand 
 Let mercy flow, revive us again 
 Like a river running through the barren land 
 Let mercy flow, revive us again 
 Move in power, save us by Your mighty hand 
 Let mercy flow, revive us again 
 Revive us again 
 Hear our cry 
 Heal our land 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 What You've done before 
 You can do again 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 Oh God, we pray for revival 
 Oh God, revive us again

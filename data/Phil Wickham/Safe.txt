To the one whose dreams have fallen all apart 
 And all you're left with is a tired and broken heart 
 I can tell by your eyes you think you're on your own 
 But you're not alone 
 Have you heard of the One who can calm the raging seas 
 Give sight to the blind, pull the lame up to their feet 
 With a love so strong it never lets you go 
 No you're not alone 
 You will be safe in His arms. You will be safe in His arms 
 The hands that hold the world are holding your heart 
 This is the promise He made, He will be with you always 
 When everything is falling apart, you will be safe in His arms 
 Did you know that the voice that brings the dead to life 
 Is the very same voice that calls you now to rise 
 So hear Him now, He's calling you home. You will never be alone 
 You will be safe in His arms. You will be safe in His arms 
 The hands that hold the world are holding your heart 
 This is the promise He made, He will be with you always 
 When everything is falling apart, you will be safe in His arms 
 Cause these are the hands that built the mountains, the hands that calm the sea 
 These are the arms that hold the lame and they are holding you and me 
 These are the hands that heal the leper pull the lame up to their feet 
 These are the arms were nailed to the cross to break our chains and set us free 
 You will be safe in His arms. You will be safe in His arms 
 The hands that hold the world are holding your heart 
 This is the promise He made, He will be with you always 
 When everything is falling apart, you will be safe in His arms 
 You will be safe 
 You will be safe 
 When everything is falling apart, you will be safe in His arms

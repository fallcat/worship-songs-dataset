A voice is on the wind 
 It calls me further in 
 I'm heading deeper into Your heart 
 Your mark is on my chest 
 My sails filled with Your breath 
 You guide me by the light of the stars 
 I'm sailing on a ship that's bound for light 
 I wrestle with the wind against the tide 
 I leave it all behind to reach for more 
 I'm sailing on to Your golden shore 
 Though skies go blue to grey 
 And I'm thrown from wave to wave 
 You still will hear these lungs singing hard 
 With every storm I face 
 I find a greater grace 
 That pulls me deeper into Your heart 
 I'm sailing on a ship that's bound for light 
 I wrestle with the wind against the tide 
 I leave it all behind to reach for more 
 I'm sailing on 
 To where the water's sweet and bright 
 The sun is rising in the eastern sky 
 I leave it all behind to reach for more 
 I'm sailing on to Your golden shore

There's a song in my soul 
 And I feel it stirring in me 
 This I know for sure 
 That your love is like a flood 
 And your mercy never ending 
 I give my song to you 
 There's a joy in my soul 
 And it rises like a morning 
 This I know for sure 
 That your grace is enough 
 And your promise never breaking 
 I give my song to you 
 All of your goodness 
 Is like a well running over 
 And all my soul, it sings for you 
 For all of your goodness 
 I will love you forever 
 All my songs, I'll sing for you 
 Yes all my songs I'll sing for you 
 There's a hope in my heart 
 Burning bright in the darkness 
 This I know for sure 
 That I will look upon your face 
 Forever dwell in your presence 
 And all I sing to you 
 All of your goodness 
 Is like a well running over 
 And all my soul, it sings for you 
 For all of your goodness 
 I will love you forever 
 All my songs, I'll sing for you 
 Yes all my songs I'll sing for you 
 Let my life be to you a symphony 
 Singing out, "holy, holy" 
 All my days, every single breath I breathe 
 Singing out, "holy, holy" 
 Let my life be to you a symphony 
 Singing out, "holy, holy" 
 All my days, every single breath I breathe 
 Singing out, "holy, holy" 
 For all of your goodness 
 Is like a well running over 
 And all my soul, it sings for you 
 For all of your goodness 
 I will love you forever 
 All my songs I sing for you 
 Yes all my songs I sing for you 
 Yeah all my songs I sing for you

Lord we're humbled in your sight 
 Shining from above how we need your light 
 Guide us in your grace 
 Guide us home 
 Lord be all that we can see 
 We ask for you to come we are on our knees 
 Save us by your grace 
 Lead us home 
 Spirit fall 
 Hear the voices round 
 Your children call out to you 
 We bow down 
 Heal the broken heart 
 Have mercy on us now 
 Love is pouring from your heart 
 Hope is in your hands, life is in your arms 
 Here in your embrace we are home 
 Spirit fall 
 Hear the voices round 
 Your children call out to you 
 And we bow down 
 Heal the broken hearts 
 Have mercy on us now 
 Spirit fall 
 Spirit fall 
 Hear your children call 
 Spirit fall on us 
 Fall on us now 
 Spirit fall 
 Hear the voices round 
 Your children call out to you 
 We bow down 
 Heal the broken heart 
 Have mercy on us now 
 All glory, honor, power is yours Amen (4x) 
 Fall

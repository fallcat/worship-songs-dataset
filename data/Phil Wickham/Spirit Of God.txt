We thirst for Your presence; send down Your rain 
 Here in this moment, a holy embrace 
 Fire of heaven, come surround 
 We bow down in reverence on this holy ground 
 Spirit of God, fall upon this place 
 Fan every heart into a burning flame 
 We long for You, call upon Your name 
 Spirit of God, have Your way 
 Have Your way, have Your way 
 Nothing between us; the veil is torn 
 You're calling us closer; We run to You, Lord 
 Spirit of God, fall upon this place 
 Fan every heart into a burning flame 
 We long for You, call upon Your name 
 Spirit of God, have Your way 
 Have Your way 
 More of You and less of me 
 God, this life will bring You glory, glory, glory 
 Spirit of God, fall upon this place 
 Fan every heart into a burning flame 
 We long for You, call upon Your name 
 Spirit of God, fall upon this place 
 Fan every heart into a burning flame 
 We long for You, call upon Your name 
 Spirit of God, have Your way 
 Have Your way

Who could know your thoughts? 
 Who could grasp your ways? 
 Who could match your goodness or deny your grace? 
 You awake my soul 
 Captivate my heart 
 Oh God, how great you are 
 You command the laws of the universe 
 Burning bright with glory infinite in worth 
 With a single word you ignite the stars 
 Oh God, how great you are 
 I stand in awe of you 
 I stand in awe of you 
 Christ the way 
 The life 
 The truth 
 I stand in awe of you

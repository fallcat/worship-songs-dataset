Starmaker 
 Standing high above 
 Wrapped in lift and crowned in love 
 Dark shaker 
 It trembles at your name 
 And here with you we are amazed 
 I can't look away 
 I am captivated 
 What else can I say 
 But sing in adoration 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 High above the earth 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 High above the earth 
 Creator 
 What mysteries you hold 
 Your words worth more than wells of gold 
 Soul waker 
 You bring our hearts to life 
 And here with you we're satisfied 
 I can't look away 
 I am captivated 
 What else can I say 
 But sing in adoration 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 High above the earth 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 High above the earth 
 I can't look away 
 I am captivated 
 What else can I say 
 But sing in adoration 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 High above the earth 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 High above the earth 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 High above the earth 
 You are holy 
 You are holy 
 You reign over all the earth

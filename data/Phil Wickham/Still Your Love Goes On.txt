I always complicate these things 
 Been living everything for me 
 But who can match Your grace 
 Your mercy can fill the darkest place 
 Still Your love goes on 
 Still You break me down 
 Still Your love runs free 
 Still You watch over me 
 Over me 
 I know sometimes I lose my way 
 And then my heart gets so afraid 
 But I realize and I must walk by faith and not by sight 
 Oh still Your love goes on 
 Oh still You break me down 
 Oh still Your love runs free 
 Oh still You watch over me 
 You watch over me oh 
 You watch over me yeah yeah 
 All is new 
 Oh Your love goes on it's all that I can say 
 Oh Your love goes on it reaches all of me 
 Oh Your love goes on into my deepest dreams 
 Oh Your love goes on and on and on 
 Still Your love goes on 
 Still You break me down 
 Still Your love runs free 
 Still You watch over me 
 You watch over me 
 Oh yeah 
 Your love goes on

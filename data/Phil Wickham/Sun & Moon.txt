If You are the Sun, then I want to be the moon 
 I want to reflect the light that shines from You 
 And if this is war then I'm going to draw my sword 
 This time I know what I am fighting for 
 God I want to let You know I love everything You are 
 I'm waiting for the morning light to show a fire in the dark 
 Shine Your Light I want to feel You now 
 God I need a miracle 
 Take my heart make it glow 
 Shine Your Light from the inside out 
 I want to be more like You 
 If You are the Sun then I want to be the moon 
 If love is a choice then I need You to hear my voice 
 I'm the one knocking on Your door making all this noise 
 Whatever it takes, I'd give all away 
 I want to show my love in a thousand ways 
 I can't live single day without You, I don't even want to try 
 I won't take another step without Your light, Your light

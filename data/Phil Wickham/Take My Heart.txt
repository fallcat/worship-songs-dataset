Inside you shine amidst this broken daylight 
 Take this darkness that I might see your goodness 
 My eyes are on the sky 
 Show me what you hold 
 You are the light of my soul 
 You have been the beauty in the song I sing 
 The fragrance of the rain 
 You have been the mystery in my deepest dreams 
 You make me fly away 
 You have been more faithful than the morning sun 
 You've given me the stars 
 Take my life 
 Take my soul 
 Take my heart 
 Take my heart 
 You make me, break me, change my life completely 
 Always, my days, I freely give you my praise 
 My heart is in your hands 
 Let me feel your touch 
 Lord I life for your love 
 Take my heart 
 Inside you shine amidst this broken daylight

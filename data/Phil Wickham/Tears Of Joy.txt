Let my last breath here 
 Be my first with You 
 Where You rob my fear 
 And You make me new 
 So whatever comes 
 Whatever I go through 
 Let my last breath here 
 Be my first with You 
 The bells will ring 
 Your banner lifted high 
 Our holy King and we Your holy bride 
 I'll join with all the saints 
 And lift my voice 
 When I see Your face 
 Through tears of joy 
 In a million years 
 We'll have just begun 
 To explore Your heart 
 And Your boundless love 
 Singing endless songs of praise 
 For who You are and what You've done 
 In a million years 
 We'll have just begun 
 The bells will ring 
 Your banner lifted high 
 Our holy King and we Your holy bride 
 I'll join with all the saints 
 And lift my voice 
 When I see Your face 
 Through tears of joy 
 So in awe 
 So amazed 
 Standing here 
 Face to face 
 Let my last breath here 
 Be my first with You 
 Where You rob my fear 
 And You make me new 
 So whatever comes 
 Whatever I go through 
 Let my last breath here 
 Be my first with You 
 Oh let my last breath here 
 Be my first with You

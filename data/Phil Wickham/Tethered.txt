I don't wanna miss the beauty 
 Of Heaven all around me 
 Your power and Your mercy 
 The greatness of Your love 
 I don't wanna lose the wonder 
 Of being in Your presence 
 Of knowing such a friendship 
 To be with You, my God 
 Everything I am 
 I throw into Your hands 
 I just want my life to ever be entwined with You 
 Tethered to Your heart 
 I just want my soul to ever stand in awe of You 
 Tethered to Your heart 
 Ooh, tethered to Your heart 
 What more could I desire 
 What greater thing to treasure 
 I'm convinced there's nothing better 
 Than living in Your love 
 Caught up in the wonder 
 Of being in Your presence 
 Of knowing such a friendship 
 To be with You, my God 
 Everything I am 
 God I throw into Your hands 
 I just want my life to ever be entwined with You 
 Tethered to Your heart 
 I just want my soul to ever stand in awe of You 
 Tethered to Your heart 
 Ooh, tethered to Your heart 
 Tethered to Your heart, yeah 
 Tethered to Your heart 
 Draw me closer 
 Take me deeper 
 I wanna be where You are 
 I wanna be where You are 
 Draw me closer 
 Take me deeper 
 I wanna be where You are 
 I wanna be where You are 
 Draw me closer 
 Take me deeper 
 I wanna be where You are 
 I wanna be where You are 
 I just want my life to ever be entwined with You 
 Tethered to Your heart 
 I just want my soul to ever stand in awe of You 
 Tethered to Your heart 
 Ooh, tethered to Your heart 
 Ooh, tethered to Your heart

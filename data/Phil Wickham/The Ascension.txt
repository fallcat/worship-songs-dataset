This is the start of something amazing 
 A moment when heaven touches earth 
 Here in our hearts Lord we are waiting 
 For something that's far beyond what we have seen or heard 
 Let us start the ascension 
 Let's begin the climb 
 Up this holy mountain 
 Where Your glory shines 
 Further up, further in 
 Just to be with You again 
 Let us start the ascension 
 We're fixing our eyes on glory and fire 
 Your name is branded on our hearts 
 You are the source of all we desire 
 Nothing can hold us back, we're running to where You are 
 Let us start the ascension 
 Let's begin the climb 
 Up this holy mountain 
 Where Your glory shines 
 Further up, further in 
 Just to be with You again 
 Let us start the ascension 
 We run to Your light 
 Let us start the ascension 
 Let's begin the climb 
 Up this holy mountain 
 Where Your glory shines 
 Further up, further in 
 Just to be with You again 
 Let us start the ascension [x2]

To the one with the wounded heart 
 The years of fighting have left you scarred 
 Wait, the light will come 
 To the one with distant eyes 
 All this crying has left you dry 
 Wait, the light will come 
 Wait, the light will come 
 Lift your eyes, the sun has overcome the night 
 Come alive as we shine in love's true light 
 Here is laughter beyond the tears 
 Here is courage to face your fears 
 Look, the light has come 
 So rise, you daughters, and stand, you sons 
 Claim the victory that Jesus won 
 Look, the Light has come 
 Look, the Light has come

Where will you run, my soul 
 Where will you go when wells run dry 
 When the wind starts to blow 
 How you gonna keep this flame alive 
 In the fading light when night is breaking 
 I know You will always be waiting 
 You'll always be there 
 I'm running to the secret place 
 Where You are, where You are 
 I sing to You of all the ways 
 You stole my heart, stole my heart 
 Better is a moment that I spend with You 
 Than a million other days away 
 I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running to the secret place 
 You are my only hope 
 You are the Rock on which I stand 
 You will not let me go 
 I know that I am safe inside Your hands 
 In the fading light when night is breaking 
 I know You will always be waiting 
 You'll always be there 
 I'm running to the secret place 
 Where You are, where You are 
 I sing to You of all the ways 
 You stole my heart, stole my heart 
 Better is a moment that I spend with You 
 Than a million other days away 
 I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running to the secret place 
 Hands are lifted high, hearts awake to life 
 We are satisfied here with You, here with You 
 Chains will hit the floor, broken lives restored 
 We couldn't ask for more here with You, here with You 
 I'm running to the secret place 
 Where You are, where You are 
 I sing to You of all the ways 
 You stole my heart, stole my heart 
 Better is a moment that I spend with You 
 Than a million other days away 
 I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running to the secret place

The battle line is drawn it's all in black and white 
 Hope is going forward and fear from behind 
 It's time 
 It's time to make a move, so what will you decide? 
 The clock is ticking on, don't let it pass you by 
 It's time 
 It's time 
 The time is now for lifting souls 
 The time is now for letting go 
 From your skin to your core 
 Let light and love come rushing through the door 
 Oh come rushing through the door 
 You've learned every song, memorized the verse 
 Took the bread and wine and even bought the shirt 
 It's time 
 It's time to hold your shield, it's time to draw your sword 
 Let's be the resistance 
 O Lord, O Lord, O Lord 
 It's time 
 Yea it's time 
 The time is now for lifting souls 
 The time is now for letting go 
 From your skin to your core 
 Let light and love come rushing through the door 
 It's time to make a stand 
 So put your heart in greater hands 
 From your skin to your core 
 Let light and love come rushing through the door 
 Sisters, brothers, 
 Thieves and lovers 
 Come on, come on eternity 
 Turn your faces 
 From finite places 
 Heaven's Grace has set you free 
 The time is now for lifting souls 
 The time is now for letting go 
 From your skin to your core 
 Let light and love come rushing through the door 
 It's time to make a stand 
 So put your heart in greater hands 
 From your skin to your core 
 Let light and love come rushing through the door 
 Your door 
 Oh come rushing through the door

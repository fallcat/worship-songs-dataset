On a hill Your blood was spilled 
 Your brow, your hands, Your feet 
 With nails and thorns the veil was torn 
 To make a way for me, You made a way for me 
 Jesus, Saviour, my God, my King, my Lord 
 Jesus, Saviour, the Victory is Yours 
 Wrapped and bound they laid You down 
 A perfect sacrifice 
 But in three days the stone was rolled away 
 Forever You're alive, forever You're alive 
 Death has been beaten, the grave has been conquered 
 Jesus is Risen, life ever after

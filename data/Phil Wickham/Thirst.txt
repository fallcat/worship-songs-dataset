Wash over me like a tidal wave 
 Clean out what pulls me to the grave 
 Nothing left that you don't love 
 Take me where your river flows 
 Heal the desert in my soul 
 Let it wash over my feet 
 All I'm asking for is just a drink 
 I thirst for You 
 Yes my soul it thirsts for You 
 Even as the deer is panting for the stream 
 Even though my soul is thirsty 
 I thirst for you 
 Spirit of the living God 
 Would you fall afresh like rain on us 
 Burst the doors and flood the halls 
 Into forgotten rooms inside our hearts 
 And we will all be swept away 
 In the current of your love and grace 
 Living water flow to me 
 All I'm asking for is just a drink 
 I thirst for you 
 Yes my soul it thirsts for you 
 Even as the deer is panting for the stream 
 Even though my soul is thirsty 
 I thirst for you 
 One thing I ask and I would seek 
 To see You there in front of me 
 With nothing standing in the way 
 Just me before You unashamed 
 I thirst for you 
 I thirst for you 
 You're the well that won't run dry 
 Only you can satisfy 
 I thirst for you 
 I thirst for you 
 Living water flow to me 
 All I ask is just one drink 
 I thirst for you

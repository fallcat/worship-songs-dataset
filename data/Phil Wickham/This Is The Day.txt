Can You hear it, the gentle voice of the Spirit 
 There's no reason to fear it, He's calling You to life 
 Just surrender, run into the arms of the Father 
 The night is finally over, take a step into the light 
 This is the day when the lost are found 
 This is the day for a new beginning 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
 Oh can You hear all the angels are singing 
 This is the day, the day when life begins 
 Can You see it a light shines into the darkness 
 Bringing hope to the hopeless, it's leading You to life 
 This is the day, when all Your sins are washed away 
 In the waves of His unending grace, forever 
 You're alive have no fear Salvation has come and He is here

I know this is love, I know this is true 
 There's nothing I need, more than I need You 
 All I can say, is never enough 
 With all that I am, I will show my love 
 Oh, oh, I Lift up my hands now 
 Oh, oh, God I will dance now 
 This love will last forever 
 Oh, oh, Lifting You higher 
 Oh, oh, is all I desire 
 This love will last forever 
 You capture my heart like nobody could 
 You broke the night and saved my life 
 Like You said You would 
 All I can say, is never enough 
 With all that I am, I will show my love 
 Your glory like sunshine 
 It covers the skyline 
 Reigning from high above 
 You're once in a life time 
 I'm all Yours Your all mine 
 In this everlasting love

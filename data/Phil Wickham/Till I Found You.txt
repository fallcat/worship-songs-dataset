I searched the Earth for something that could satisfy 
 A peace for the heart I had buried deep inside 
 Knees on the floor, I finally found everything I needed 
 You lifted my soul and opened up my eyes 
 And I never knew anything lasts forever 
 Till I found You, till I found You 
 I never dreamed anything could be better 
 Till I found You, till I found You 
 You rewrited my story 
 And I'm brand new like the morning 
 Oh, I never knew anything lasts forever 
 Till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Count all the days I'm chasing after what won't last 
 I'm done with building these castles that crumble like sand 
 Oh, knees on the floor, I finally found that everything I needed was always right in front of me 
 You gave me a name, You changed everything, yeah yeah 
 I never knew anything lasts forever 
 Till I found You, till I found You 
 I never dreamed anything could be better 
 Till I found You, till I found You 
 You rewrited my story 
 And I'm brand new like the morning 
 Oh I never knew anything lasts forever 
 Till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 I never knew anything lasts forever 
 Till I found You, till I found You 
 I never dreamed anything could be better 
 Till I found You, till I found You 
 You rewrited my story 
 And I'm brand new like the morning 
 Oh I never knew anything lasts forever 
 Till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You 
 Till I, till I 
 You rewrited my story 
 And I'm brand new like the morning 
 Oh I never knew anything lasts forever 
 Till I found You 
 Till I, till I found You

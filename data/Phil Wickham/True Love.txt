Come close, listen to the story 
 About a love more faithful than the morning 
 The Father gave His only Son just to save us 
 The earth was shaking in the dark 
 All creation felt the Father's broken heart 
 Tears were filling heaven's eyes 
 The day that true love died, the day that true love died 
 When blood and water hit the ground 
 Walls we couldn't move came crashing down 
 We were free and made alive 
 The day that true love died, the day that true love died 
 Search your hearts, you know you can't deny it 
 Lose your life just so you can find it 
 The Father gave His only Son just to save us 
 Jesus is alive 
 He rose again

When my heart 
 Is torn asunder 
 And my world 
 Just falls apart 
 Lord You put 
 Me back together 
 And lift me up 
 To where You are 
 There is hope 
 Beyond the suffering 
 Joy beyond the tears 
 Peace in every tragedy 
 Love that conquers fear 
 I have found redemption 
 In the blood of Christ 
 My body might be dying 
 But I'll always be alive 
 You have turned 
 Mourning to dancing 
 You have covered me with grace 
 The struggle here 
 May last a moment 
 But life with You 
 Will last always 
 There is hope 
 Beyond the suffering 
 Joy beyond the tears 
 Peace in every tragedy 
 Love that conquers fear 
 I have found redemption 
 In the blood of Christ 
 My body might be dying 
 But I'll always be alive 
 When the age 
 Of death is over 
 And this world 
 Has been reborn 
 I'll be there 
 Beside my Savior 
 This is our grace 
 And rich reward 
 There is hope 
 Beyond the suffering 
 Joy beyond the tears 
 Peace in every tragedy 
 Love that conquers fear 
 I have found redemption 
 In the blood of Christ 
 My body might be dying 
 But I'll always be alive

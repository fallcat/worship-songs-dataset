Through the veil, we have come 
 You've paid the price, a sacrifice, of flesh and blood 
 Hearts ablaze, drawing close 
 The holy place now invades the human soul 
 Wide awake, unashamed, in Your light 
 By Your grace, boldly running to Your side 
 Captivated, oh I am taken by everything You are 
 I want to be closer and closer and closer to Your heart 
 I want to be closer and closer and closer to Your heart 
 Hope is here, love has won 
 With burning hearts, into Your arms 
 Oh God, we run 
 All my life and all my days 
 Holding nothing back, giving all I am 
 For Your great name 
 Wide awake, unashamed in Your light 
 By Your grace, boldly running to Your side 
 Captivated, oh I am taken by everything You are 
 I want to be closer and closer and closer to Your heart 
 I want to be closer and closer and closer to Your heart 
 Wide awake, unashamed in Your light 
 By Your grace, boldly running to Your side 
 Captivated, oh I am taken by everything You are 
 I want to be closer and closer and closer to Your heart 
 I want to be closer and closer and closer to Your heart

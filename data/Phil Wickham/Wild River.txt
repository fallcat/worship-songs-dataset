There is a fountain that never runs dry 
 Forever flows with water of life 
 You never stop moving 
 You never stop moving 
 Where Your river runs, everything lives 
 And where Your river goes will never thirst again 
 You never stop moving 
 You never stop moving 
 Your mercy flows like a wild, wild river 
 Your love is strong like the raging sea 
 God, all Your goodness goes beyond all measure 
 Your grace like a flood pouring out of me 
 You call me out to walk with You on the sea 
 Even in my doubt, deep calls to deep 
 You never stop moving 
 You never stop moving 
 Your mercy flows like a wild, wild river 
 Your love is strong like the raging sea 
 God, all Your goodness goes beyond all measure 
 Your grace like a flood pouring out of me 
 Your grace a limitless ocean 
 I'm swept away in the tide 
 Draw from the well of Your goodness 
 Drink from the water of life 
 Your grace a limitless ocean 
 I'm swept away in the tide 
 Draw from the well of Your goodness 
 Drink from the water of life 
 Your grace a limitless ocean 
 I'm swept away in the tide 
 Draw from the well of Your goodness 
 Drink from the water 
 Your mercy flows like a wild, wild river 
 Your love is strong like the raging sea 
 God, all Your goodness goes beyond all measure 
 Your grace like a flood pouring out of me

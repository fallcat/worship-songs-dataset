I can see You 
 In the light of a new dawn 
 I can hear You 
 In the words of a love song 
 I know it in my heart 
 I know it in my soul 
 I can feel You 
 In the breath of a newborn 
 I can feel You 
 In the wind and the rainstorm 
 I know it in my heart 
 I know it in my soul 
 Oh, You are Wonderful 
 And what else can my soul sing 
 All Your hands have made 
 Everything You've done 
 Oh my God You're wonderful 
 You were there 
 When the heavens were fashioned 
 You spoke a word 
 And You set it all in motion 
 I know it in my heart 
 I know it in my soul 
 Oh, You are Wonderful 
 And what else can my soul sing 
 All Your hands have made 
 Everything You've done 
 Oh my God You're wonderful 
 In the brand new life 
 Of a brilliant spring 
 The promises of a wedding ring 
 I see Your love 
 I see Your heart 
 Oh how wonderful You are 
 In a mother's touch 
 A father's cry 
 A friend who freely gives His life 
 I see Your love 
 I see Your heart 
 Oh my God how wonderful You are 
 Oh, You are Wonderful 
 And what else can my soul sing 
 All Your hands have made 
 Everything You've done 
 Oh my God You're wonderful 
 You're Wonderful 
 (Oh You are Wonderful 
 Oh my God You're Wonderful)

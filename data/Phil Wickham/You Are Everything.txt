There is a love hidden inside your borders 
 Just waiting to be free, just waiting to be free. 
 There is a hope hidden inside your borders 
 Just waiting to be realized, just waiting to be realized. 
 So keep hoping Saint Francis, you'll be a free man yet, 
 You'll see the sun shine again over your city streets. 
 There is a love hidden inside your borders 
 Just waiting to be free, just waiting to be free. 
 There is a hope hidden inside your borders 
 Just waiting to be realized, just waiting to be realized. 
 So keep hoping Saint Francis, you'll be a free man yet, 
 You'll see the sun shine again over your city streets. 
 Keep hoping Saint Francis, you'll be a free man yet. 
 Though darkness covers your sleeping love, it won't last. 
 Those who wait upon the Lord will renew their strength, 
 I know, those who wait upon the Lord will not be put to shame. 
 Those who wait upon the Lord will renew their strength, 
 I know, I know, those who wait upon the Lord will not be put to shame. 
 And so we wait, so we wait for the sun to shine. 
 And so we wait, so we wait for You to come. 
 Keep hoping Saint Francis, you'll be a free man yet, 
 You'll see the sun shine again over your city streets.

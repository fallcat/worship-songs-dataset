I see Your face in every sunrise 
 The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes 
 The world awakens in the light of the day 
 I look up to the sky and say 
 You're beautiful 
 I see Your power in the moonlit night 
 Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright 
 We are amazed in the light of the stars 
 It's all proclaiming who You are 
 You're beautiful 
 I see You there hanging on a tree 
 You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me 
 Now You are sitting on Your heavenly throne 
 Soon we will be coming home 
 You're beautiful 
 When we arrive at eternity's shore 
 Where death is just a memory and tears are no more 
 We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring 
 Your bride will come together and we'll sing 
 You're beautiful 
 I see Your face, I see Your face 
 I see Your face, You're beautiful 
 You're beautiful 
 You're beautiful

Here in the final hour, hope lifts the tired eyes 
 Here now, we are waiting for You to arrive 
 Great things are set in motion 
 The sky breaks, the trumpets sound 
 You call all Your children to meet You in the clouds 
 We are waiting, anticipating 
 Your arrival, Your arrival 
 Voices raising, celebrating 
 Your arrival, Your arrival 
 We'll keep the candle burning, we'll watch for every sight 
 Here now, we are waiting for You to arrive 
 Great things are 'bout to happen 
 Lord lives, Your Kingdom come 
 And call us home to heaven, the city of our God 
 Haste the day 
 We are waiting, anticipating 
 Your arrival, Your arrival 
 Voices raising, celebrating 
 Your arrival, Your arrival 
 This is our song 
 Wherever You are 
 Is where we belong 
 We want to be with You 
 We are waiting, anticipating 
 Your arrival, Your arrival 
 Voices raising, celebrating 
 Your arrival, Your arrival

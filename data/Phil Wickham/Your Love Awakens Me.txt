There were walls between us 
 By the cross, You came and broke them down 
 You broke them down 
 There were chains around us 
 By Your grace, we are no longer bound 
 No longer bound 
 You called me out of the grave 
 You called me into the light 
 You called my name 
 And then my heart came alive 
 Your love is greater 
 Your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Your love is greater 
 Your love is stronger 
 Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me 
 Feel the darkness shaking 
 All the dead are coming back to life 
 Back to life 
 Hear the song awaken 
 All creation singing we're alive 
 Cause You're alive 
 What a love we've found 
 Death can't hold us down 
 We shout it out 
 We're alive 'cause You're alive

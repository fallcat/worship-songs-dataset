Lord You are the anchor 
 Refuge in the storm 
 Your words are wisdom 
 Shining in the dark 
 I hear Your voice on the water 
 I feel Your touch in the wind 
 Your above and beneath me 
 Surround my heart again 
 And I know that You are good 
 God I know that all You do is good 
 So I put my life in Your hands 
 I'm Yours alone, I'm Yours alone 
 Surrender, Lord I raise my hands 
 To You alone, to You alone 
 Lord Your voice guides me 
 So Tell me what to do 
 Your heart it drives me 
 To follow after You

'Tis so sweet, to trust in Jesus 
 Just to take Him at His word 
 Just to rest, upon His promise 
 Just to know, thus says the Lord 
 Jesus Jesus how I trust Him 
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er 
 Jesus Jesus, precious Jesus 
 Oh for grace to trust Him more 
 Oh how sweet to trust in Jesus 
 Just to trust His cleansing blood 
 And in simple faith to plunge me 
 'Neath the healing cleansing flood 
 Jesus Jesus how I trust Him 
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er 
 Jesus Jesus, precious Jesus 
 Oh for grace to trust Him more 
 I'm so glad, I learned to trust Thee 
 Precious Jesus Savior Friend 
 And I know, that Thou art with me 
 Will be with me to the end 
 Jesus Jesus how I trust Him 
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er 
 Jesus Jesus, precious Jesus 
 Oh for grace to trust Him more 
 Jesus Jesus how I trust Him 
 How I've proved Him o'er and o'er 
 Jesus Jesus, precious Jesus 
 Oh for grace to trust Him more

Tears dripped off of her crimson face 
 She covered her head tryin' to hide her shame 
 Caught and condemned, now she can't get away 
 Just a pawn in the hands of a Pharisee game 
 The noise and the rage of the frenzied grew 
 As they struggled for the power in an ageless feud 
 And as she softly cried, they again reviewed 
 The obvious fate of this ill-repute 
 Then a voice of love ended all debate 
 His words of hope sent the crowd away 
 The hand that flung the stars in space 
 Lifted her face and she heard Him say 
 Let Me introduce you to a friend called Grace 
 Doesn't care about your past or your many mistakes 
 He'll cover your sins in a warm embrace 
 Let me introduce you to a friend 
 A friend called Grace 
 The courtroom croud grew quiet and still 
 As the white-robed judge called Truth appeared 
 And the ring of the gavel brought a fierce debate 
 As the players of eternity decided my fate 
 In the light of Truth all could clearly see 
 The facts made the trial mere formality 
 And my accusers stood with bated breath 
 Confident conviction would end in death 
 But from the blood-stained cross to the witness stand 
 Walked a man with hope in His nail-scarred hands 
 The words He spoke brought me sweet release 
 He whispered "I've a friend that you need to meet" 
 If you're tired of the guilt and the sleepless nights 
 And running from the shame of a wasted life 
 There's Someone standing with an open hand 
 Waiting there to give you a second chance

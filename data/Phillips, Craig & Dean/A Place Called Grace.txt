So many years I heard it told 
 The story of compassion 
 A prodigal son who left the fold 
 And found no satisfaction 
 On my knees, Lord, I cried out to You 
 "I'm so alone 
 But if there's room in Your house for one more 
 I'm ready to come back home" 
 I know there is a place 
 Where arms of compassion welcome me home 
 Sweet mercy falls like rain 
 I know there's a place called grace 
 So many days I've trusted grace 
 Yet I have to wonder 
 How many times my human strength 
 Has kept me from surrender 
 The more I learn just to lean on the cross 
 The more I see 
 When I fall, I will fall to the place 
 Where mercy reaches me 
 If it seems that my courage is strong 
 There's just one reason 
 He's my rock when my faith is all gone 
 He holds me in His arms 
 Gives me strength to carry on

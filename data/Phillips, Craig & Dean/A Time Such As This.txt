For a time such as this 
 We've been born, we've been blessed 
 Long before time began 
 We were in the Father's plan 
 By His love, by His will 
 He would see the dream fulfilled 
 By the blood of His own Son 
 We are free, we are one 
 We will rise and face the darkness 
 We will shine His holy light 
 We will live to love the hopeless 
 We will lift the Cross of Christ 
 We will raise the flag of freedom 
 For His blood is our defense 
 He has called us, for a time 
 A time such as this 
 For a son far from home 
 For a child who cries alone 
 For a life on the line 
 Barely a man, too young to die 
 For a world such as this 
 Jesus dies, Jesus lives 
 Look around, see His face 
 The time is now, seize the day 
 We will rise and face the darkness 
 We will shine His holy light 
 We will live to love the hopeless 
 We will lift the Cross of Christ 
 We will raise the flag of freedom 
 For His blood is our defense 
 He has called us, for a time such as this 
 For a time such as 
 This is the moment we have lived for 
 Destiny is waiting beyond the open door 
 We will rise and face the darkness 
 We will shine His holy light 
 We will live to love the hopeless 
 We will lift the Cross of Christ 
 We will raise the flag of freedom 
 For His blood is our defense 
 He has called us, for a time such as this 
 And we will rise and face the darkness 
 We will shine His holy light 
 We will live to love the hopeless 
 We will lift the Cross of Christ 
 We will raise the flag of freedom 
 For His blood is our defense 
 He has called us, for a time such as this 
 For a time such as this 
 For a time such as this 
 For a time such as this...

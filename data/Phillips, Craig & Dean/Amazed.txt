You dance over me, 
 While I am unaware. 
 You sing all around, 
 But I never hear the sound. 
 Lord, I'm amazed by you 
 Lord, I'm amazed by you 
 Lord, I'm amazed by you 
 How you love me. 
 You paint the morning sky 
 With miracles in mind 
 My hope will always stand 
 For you hold me in your hand 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 How you love me. 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 How you love me. 
 How wide, how deep, how great, is your love for me. 
 How wide, how deep, how great, is your love for me. 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 Lord I'm amazed by you 
 How you love me. 
 Lord you love me.

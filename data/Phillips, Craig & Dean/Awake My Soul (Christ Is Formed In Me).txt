When I close my eyes, I can see Your glory 
 When I raise my hands, I can touch Your face 
 When I bow my knees, I stand before You 
 And Christ is formed me 
 Awake my soul, prepare an entrance for Your glory 
 And let my heart become a throne for You to dwell 
 And when I need Your Holy Spirit more than life itself 
 Then Christ is formed in me 
 When I lose myself, I reflect Your image 
 When I break, I break my will, then I am whole 
 When I give, give my all, I find life everlasting 
 Then Christ is formed in me

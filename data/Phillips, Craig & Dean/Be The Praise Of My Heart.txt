Not just a song that I sing to You 
 And not just some motions that I'm going through 
 You know me well, You see my life, the good and the bad 
 And You see beyond the face that I wear 
 You see my soul laid open and bare 
 Here in this place this is my hope, this is my prayer 
 The praise of my heart, the worship I bring 
 The life that I live is the song that I sing 
 Let it be real 
 Each note that I play, every moment of every day 
 Be the praise of my heart 
 Be the praise of my heart 
 Be the praise of my heart 
 Not just with my lips, and not from afar 
 Let me draw close to the beauty you are 
 Here in Your heart, see in Your face, that's my desire 
 One thing I ask, one thing I seek 
 To dwell in your house, to sit at Your feet 
 To look in your eyes, to gaze on the one that makes me complete

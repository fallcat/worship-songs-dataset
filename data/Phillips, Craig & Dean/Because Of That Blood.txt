Earn your way, that's the lesson that we're taught 
 But I know things eternal can't be sold and can't be bought 
 Amazing grace is something I could never hold 
 And I know love and mercy are outside of my control 
 But I'm reminded of a ransom, paid beyond my worth 
 On a hill outside the city, where heaven kissed the earth 
 Because of that blood, because of that dream 
 Because of that mercy pouring over me 
 Because of that grace I've been set free 
 Because of You, Jesus, I have been redeemed 
 Some believe that they can make it on their own 
 But only in the end to find they're really not that strong 
 But I believe that if I choose to live by faith 
 That God will give me strength to make it each and every day 
 For we are lost without a Savior, to save us from ourselves 
 For it's only by the grace of God that we can live to tell, hey 
 Because of that blood, because of that dream 
 Because of that mercy pouring over me 
 Because of that grace I've been set free 
 Because of You, Jesus, I have been redeemed 
 Who of us can say that we are worthy of the blood of Jesus Christ 
 All that we can do is simply offer Him our own by laying down our lives 
 Because of that blood, because of that dream 
 Because of that mercy pouring over me 
 Because of that grace I've been set free 
 Because of You, Jesus, I have been redeemed 
 Because of that grace I've been set free 
 Because of You, Jesus, I have been redeemed 
 Oh, thank You, Lord 
 Oh, because of that blood

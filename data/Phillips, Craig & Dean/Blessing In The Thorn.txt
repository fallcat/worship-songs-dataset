I read about a man of God 
 Who gloried in his weakness 
 And I wished that I could be 
 More like Him and less like me 
 Am I to blame for what I'm not 
 Or is pain the way God teaches me to grow? 
 I need to know 
 When does the thorn become a blessing? 
 When does the pain become a friend? 
 When does the weakness make me stronger? 
 When does my faith make me whole again? 
 I want to feel His arms around me 
 In the middle of my raging storm 
 So that I can see the blessing in the thorn 
 I heard it said the strength of Christ 
 Is perfect in my weakness 
 And the more that I go through 
 The more I prove the promise true 
 His love will go to any length 
 It reaches even now to where I am 
 But tell me once again 
 When does the thorn become a blessing? 
 When does the pain become a friend? 
 When does the weakness make me stronger? 
 When does my faith make me whole again? 
 I want to feel His arms around me 
 In the middle of my raging storm 
 So that I can see the blessing in the thorn 
 Lord, I have to ask You 
 On the cross You suffered through 
 Was there a time You ever doubted 
 What You already knew? 
 When does the thorn become a blessing? 
 When does the pain become a friend? 
 When does my weakness make me stronger? 
 When does my faith make me whole again? 
 I want to feel His arms around me 
 In the middle of my raging storm 
 So that I can see the blessing in the thorn 
 Oh, I want to see the Blessing in the thorn

Isn't it crazy, we haven't spoken in years 
 We were the closest friends 
 Where did we part, when did the love disappear 
 We thought it'd never end 
 Just a causeless separation 
 A turn in the road of life 
 But now we're nothing more than strangers 
 Don't you think that it's time to 
 Let's build a bridge of love together 
 One stone of hope at a time 
 Let's span the sea that comes between us 
 So join your hand and heart with mine 
 The timing is right for our differences to cease 
 O Father make us one 
 Let's join in the fight to love all humanity 
 Our time has just begaun 
 We can use these precious moments 
 To tear apart dividing walls 
 And with those stones of separation 
 Build a bridge for all 
 Every race and every nation 
 United and unique 
 We're all just links in a chain of love 
 I need you, you need me

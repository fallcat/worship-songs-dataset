Jesus touched the woman 
 With faith that made her whole 
 He healed the blind and fed 5,000 men 
 Cleansed a group of lepers 
 Gave strength to the lame 
 And He brought dead men back to life again 
 He cast out many demons 
 And opened deafened ears 
 He forgave the woman caught in shame 
 Jesus walked with His disciples 
 And even washed their feet 
 He taught them how to call upon His name 
 When Pilate asked if someone 
 In the crowd that day 
 Could say just what this man had done 
 This is what he said 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Is anybody here gonna testify? 
 Stand and shout what Jesus Christ has done 
 For you in days gone by 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Does anybody here wanna stand up for the Lord? 
 Rise and speak the truth 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Jesus found us broken 
 Took away our sins 
 He gave our suffering spirits a voice 
 He who stilled the restless waves 
 Has met our every need 
 Well, we should have a reason to rejoice 
 Oh, we could sit so quietly 
 And never make a sound 
 But someone out there needs to hear 
 What He's done for you, huh! 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Is anybody here gonna testify? 
 Stand and shout what Jesus Christ has done 
 For you in days gone by 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Does anybody here wanna stand up for the Lord? 
 Rise and speak the truth 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Come on, brother! 
 Is anybody here gonna testify, testify 
 Come on, now 
 Is anybody here gonna testify, testify 
 Come on, now 
 Is anybody here gonna testify 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Is anybody here gonna testify? 
 Stand and shout what Jesus Christ has done 
 For you in days gone by 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Does anybody here wanna stand up for the Lord? 
 Rise and speak the truth 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Is anybody here gonna testify? 
 Stand and shout what Jesus Christ has done 
 For you in days gone by 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Does anybody here wanna stand up for the Lord? 
 Rise and speak the truth...

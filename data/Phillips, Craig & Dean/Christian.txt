Some talk about virtue 
 Some preach about vice 
 Some say the road to heaven 
 Is paved with thin ice 
 Some people keep sinning 
 They don't think about it twice 
 Still some have been born again 
 And bound for paradise 
 So many are called 
 So few want to come 
 Backs up against the wall 
 And still choose to run 
 But I'm proud that I'm a Christian 
 I'll say it loud that I'm a Christian 
 There ain't no doubt that I'm a Christian 
 I am so proud of it 
 Lord, I'm so proud of it 
 You can read it in the paper 
 Or watch the evening news 
 Surveys say the planet's 
 Got those spiritual blues 
 Some people you meet 
 Think their soul is in their shoes 
 Care not to be complete 
 Their minds content to be confused 
 No hope in their heart 
 No love in their eyes 
 They reject His promises 
 And waste their lives 
 But I'm proud that I'm a Christian 
 I'll say it loud that I'm a Christian 
 There ain't no doubt that I'm a Christian 
 I am so proud of it 
 Lord, I'm so proud of it 
 Some talk about religion 
 Some preach about sin 
 Some assume denominations 
 Are the way to get in 
 Don't think your brother has to 
 Have the same skin 
 Just believe that Jesus came 
 To save all men 
 Say it once again 
 And be proud to be a Christian 
 Say it loud to be a Christian 
 Have no doubt and be a Christian 
 Say it loud 
 I'm saved and I'm proud

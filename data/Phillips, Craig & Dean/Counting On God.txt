I'm in a fight not physical 
 And I'm in a war 
 But not with this world 
 You are the light that's beautiful 
 And I want more 
 I want all that's Yours 
 Joy unspeakable that won't go away 
 And just enough strength 
 To live for today 
 So I never have to worry 
 What tomorrow will bring 
 'Cause my faith is on solid rock 
 I am counting on God 
 I am counting, I am counting on God 
 I am counting, I am counting on God 
 I am counting, I am counting on God 
 I am counting, I am counting on God 
 The miracle of Christ in me 
 Is the mystery that sets me free 
 I'm nothing like I used to be 
 Open up your eyes you'll see

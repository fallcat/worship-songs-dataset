(Randy Phillips/Denise Phillips/Dave Clark/Don Koch) 
 As I look back 
 On what I thought was living 
 I'm amazed at the price 
 I choose to pay 
 And to think I ignored 
 What really mattered 
 'Cause I thought the sacrifice 
 Would be too great 
 But when I finally reached 
 The point of giving in 
 I found the cross 
 Was calling even then 
 And even though 
 It took dying to survive 
 I've never felt so much alive 
 For I am crucified with Christ 
 And yet I live 
 Not I but Christ 
 That lives within me 
 His Cross will never ask for more 
 Than I can give 
 For it's not my strength but His 
 There's no greater sacrifice 
 For I am crucified with Christ 
 And yet I live 
 As I hear the Savior 
 Call for daily dying 
 I will bow beneath 
 The weight of Calvary 
 Let my hands surrender 
 To His piercing purpose 
 That holds me to the cross 
 Yet sets me free 
 I will glory in 
 The power of the cross 
 The things I thought were gain 
 I count as loss 
 And with His suffering 
 I identify 
 And by His resurrection power 
 I am alive 
 For I am crucified with Christ 
 And yet I live 
 Not I but Christ 
 That lives within me 
 His Cross will never ask for more 
 Than I can give 
 For it's not my strength but His 
 There's no greater sacrifice 
 For I am crucified with Christ 
 And yet I live 
 And I will offer all I have 
 So that His cross is not in vain 
 For I found to live is Christ 
 And to die is truly gain 
 For I am crucified with Christ 
 And yet I live 
 Not I but Christ 
 That lives within me 
 His Cross will never ask for more 
 Than I can give 
 For it's not my strength but His 
 There's no greater sacrifice 
 For I am crucified with Christ 
 And yet I live 
 For I am crucified with Christ 
 And yet I live

What to say, Lord? 
 It's You who give me life 
 And I can't explain just how 
 How much you mean to me 
 Now that You would save me, Lord 
 I give all that I am to You 
 That every day I can be a light that shines your name 
 Be a light that shines your name 
 Every day, Lord 
 I'll learn to stand upon your word 
 And I pray that, 
 I might come to know you more 
 That you would guide me 
 In every step I take, Lord 
 That every day I can 
 Be a light unto the world 
 Every day, It's you I'll live for 
 Every day, I'll follow after you 
 Every day, I'll walk with You, my Lord 
 It's you I live for every day...

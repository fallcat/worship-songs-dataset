What can I say that You never heard 
 What can I offer You 
 Where can I go that You have never been 
 That You can't lead me through 
 Take my prayer, hear my cry 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Fall down on me 
 And drive me to my knees 
 Our over me 
 Deeper than the sea 
 Rain on me with a love until I drown 
 I need You to fall down 
 Well, if I had one place 
 Just one place to be 
 Well, I'd be at Your feet 
 And if I had one prayer 
 I know what I'd pray 
 I'd ask You to fall down on me 
 Take my prayer, hear my cry 
 Only You can satisfy 
 Take my words, hear my cry 
 Only You can satisfy

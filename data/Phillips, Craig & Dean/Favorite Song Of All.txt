He loves to hear the wind sing 
 As it whistles through the pines and mountain leaves 
 And He love to hear the raindrops 
 As they splash to the ground in a magic melody 
 He smiles in sweet approval 
 As the waves crash through the rocks in harmony 
 And creation joins in unity 
 To sing to Him majestic symphonies 
 But His favorite song of all 
 Is the song of the redeemed 
 When lost sinners now made clean 
 Lift their voices loud and strong 
 When those purchased by His blood 
 Lift to Him a song of love 
 There's nothin' more He'd rather hear 
 Nor so pleasin' to His ear 
 As His favorite song of all 
 And He loves to hear the angels 
 As they sing, "Holy, holy is the Lamb" 
 Heaven's choirs in harmony 
 Lift up praises to the Great I Am 
 But He lifts His hands for silence 
 When the weakest saved by grace begins to sing 
 And a million angels listen 
 As a newborn soul sings, "I've been redeemed!" 
 'Cause His favorite song of all 
 Is the song of the redeemed 
 When lost sinners now made clean 
 Lift their voices loud and strong 
 When those purchased by His blood 
 Lift to Him a song of love 
 There's nothin' more He'd rather hear 
 Nor so pleasin' to His ear 
 As His favorite song of all 
 It's not just melodies and harmonies 
 That catches His attention 
 It's not just clever lines and phrases 
 That causes Him to stop and listen 
 But when anyone set free, 
 Washed and bought by Calvary begins to sing 
 That's His favorite song of all 
 Is the song of the redeemed 
 When lost sinners now made clean 
 Lift their voices loud and strong 
 When those purchased by His blood 
 Lift to Him a song of love 
 There's nothin' more He'd rather hear 
 Nor so pleasin' to His ear 
 As His favorite song of all 
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb 
 Halleluiah, halleluiah

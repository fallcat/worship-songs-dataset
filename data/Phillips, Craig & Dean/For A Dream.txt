Gray clouds hung like a misty shroud 
 On the battlefield that day 
 And the meadow was strewn with the heroes 
 Who had fallen by the way 
 And a soldier cries as he watches his blood 
 Spill on the Belgian snow 
 And he wonders if he'll live till the morning light 
 Or die here in the bitter cold 
 Why was he here in the first place? 
 He was much too young to die 
 Could this be a cause that was worthy 
 Of such a costly sacrifice? 
 Then he thinks about a home in the Texas pines 
 And a lady he'd love to see 
 And something inside says it's worth the price 
 The fight for liberty 
 It was for a dream 
 For a dream 
 For a hope that a child yet unborn 
 Would know about liberty 
 It was for a dream 
 For a dream 
 For the hope that a son that he's never seen 
 Would know about being in the land of the free 
 So he laid his life on the line for a dream 
 Another field of battle 
 Another place and time 
 A soldier hangs between heaven and hell 
 His life now on the line 
 Abandoned in the heat of battle 
 He cries in silent pain 
 Alone to face His enemies 
 As they mock and they curse His name 
 Why was he here in the first place? 
 Wasn't there some other way? 
 Was redemption's plan for fallen man 
 Worth this price He would have to pay? 
 But in His mind He could see 
 A people holy, strong and free 
 Bought by the blood of a man who had fought 
 And won their liberty 
 It was for a dream 
 For a dream 
 For a hope that a people who were yet unborn 
 Could know about liberty 
 It was for a dream 
 For a dream 
 For the hope that a people He's never seen 
 Would know about living life abundantly 
 So he laid his life on the line for a dream

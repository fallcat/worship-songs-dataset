Upon a night so dark 
 They saw a brilliant star 
 Heaven was reaching down 
 Heaven was reaching down 
 The long awaited One 
 The Father's perfect Son 
 The lost can now be found 
 The lost can now be found 
 Rejoice, in a manger lay 
 The promise of God's love for us 
 For everyone 
 Rejoice, here upon this day 
 Our Emmanuel has come 
 Blessed hope for all the world 
 There in the humble place 
 Though just a tiny babe 
 Our God victorious 
 Our God victorious 
 A perfect life to live 
 He chose to bear our sin 
 We sing, "How glorious" 
 We sing, "How glorious" 
 Rejoice, in a manger lay 
 The promise of God's love for us 
 For everyone 
 Rejoice, here upon this day 
 Our Emmanuel has come 
 Blessed hope for all the world 
 Heaven and angels sing 
 The coming of the King 
 The only Son of God most high 
 His name is Jesus Christ 
 Rejoice, in a manger lay 
 The promise of God's love for us 
 For everyone 
 Rejoice, here upon this day 
 Our Emmanuel has come 
 Blessed hope for all 
 Rejoice, in a manger lay 
 The promise of God's love for us 
 For everyone 
 Rejoice, here upon this day 
 Our Emmanuel has come 
 Blessed hope for all the world

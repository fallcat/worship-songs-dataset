There is a time to live, there is a time to die 
 There is a time to laugh, there is a time to cry 
 There is a time to dance, a time for joy's embrace 
 And there are seasons, God, we humbly seek Your faith 
 This is our offering to You, this is our offering 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone 
 There is a time to sow, there is a time to reap 
 A time for victory, a time to claim defeat 
 A time to be renewed, a time to be reborn 
 And in all seasons, God, we bow before Your throne 
 This is our offering to You, this is our offering 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone 
 The world is nothing without You 
 And we could only live because You made us 
 The world is nothing without You 
 And we could only live because You made us to 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone 
 Everything I am is for Your glory 
 Everything I am for You alone

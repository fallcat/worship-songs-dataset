Standing on the shoreline 
 Looking out to sea 
 At oceans of Your hopes for me 
 Just beyond my reach 
 I've been here on this island 
 For way too many years 
 A prisoner of my comfort 
 A slave to my own fear 
 Doubt is saying got to stay 
 Faith is saying sail away 
 I know it's safe here on the shore 
 But freedom is worth dying for 
 Liberation comes to those 
 Who hear the truth and sail with You 
 I'll go where You are calling me 
 I'll be what You meant me to be 
 I know the risk is real 
 But I wanna feel 
 The freedom of the sea 
 With eyes to the horizon 
 Mist against my face 
 I'll leave behind this island 
 In Your abounding grace 
 With Your word as my compass 
 I'll chase my destiny 
 For I know the winds of Your will 
 Can set my spirit free 
 Doubt is saying got to stay 
 Faith is saying sail away 
 I know it's safe here on the shore 
 But freedom is worth dying for 
 Liberation comes to those 
 Who hear the truth and sail with You 
 I'll go where You are calling me 
 I'll be what You meant me to be 
 I know the risk is real 
 But I wanna feel 
 The freedom of the sea 
 Doubt is saying got to stay 
 But I'm taking up the anchor 
 Faith is saying sail away 
 And I'm heading for the deep 
 I know it's safe here on the shore 
 But freedom is worth dying for 
 Liberation comes to those 
 Who hear the truth and sail with You 
 I'll go where You are calling me 
 I'll be what You meant me to be 
 I know the risk is real 
 But I wanna feel 
 The freedom of the sea 
 The freedom of the sea... 
 The freedom of the sea...

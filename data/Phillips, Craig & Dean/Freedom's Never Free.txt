Standing on a hillside 
 Where the river meets the sea 
 White crosses without number 
 Line the fields of peace 
 And each one a silent witness 
 Staring back at me 
 Every cross a story 
 Of another place in time 
 Where young men thought it worthy 
 To give their life for mine 
 And for the sake of honor 
 Left their dreams behind 
 And for the price they paid 
 I'm forever in their debt 
 Their memory will not die 
 'Cause I will not forget 
 I will stand and hold my head up high 
 I will dedicate my life 
 To the glory of the ones who had to die 
 I will live, live what I believe 
 If for no one else but me 
 I will remember 
 That freedom's never free 
 It was on another hillside 
 Outside the city gates 
 The battle lines were drawn 
 As soldiers took their place 
 The Father watched in silence 
 As a cross was raised 
 With freedom drawing closer 
 He took His final breath 
 He drank our cup of guilt 
 And took the sting from death 
 Heaven's Finest Soldier 
 Clothed in human flesh 
 And for the price He paid 
 I'm forever in His debt 
 The cross will never die 
 'Cause I will not forget 
 I will stand and hold my head up high 
 I will dedicate my life 
 To the glory of the One who had to die 
 I will live, live what I believe 
 If for no one else but me 
 To remember that 
 Freedom's Never Free 
 I will walk free 
 I will stay free 
 I will live free 
 I will die free!

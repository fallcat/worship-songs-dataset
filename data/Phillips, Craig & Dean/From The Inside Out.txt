A thousand times I've failed 
 Still your mercy remains 
 And should I stumble again 
 Still I'm caught in your grace 
 Everlasting 
 Your light will shine when all else fades 
 Never ending 
 Your glory goes beyond all fame 
 My heart and my soul, Lord I give you control 
 Consume me from the inside out Lord 
 Let justice and praise become my embrace 
 To love You from the inside out 
 Your will above all else, my purpose remains 
 The art of losing myself in bringing you praise 
 Everlasting 
 Your light will shine when all else fades 
 Never ending 
 Your glory goes beyond all fame 
 And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise 
 From the inside out Lord, my soul cries out 
 My soul cries out, my soul cries out to You 
 My soul cries out, my soul cries out

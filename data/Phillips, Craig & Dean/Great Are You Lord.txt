The beauty of your majesty 
 And displayed for all the world to see 
 Is it any wonder? Is it any wonder? 
 The glory of Your holiness 
 The mercy of Your faithfulness 
 Is it any wonder? Is it any wonder? 
 We sing great are You, Lord, for we adore You 
 Lift up Your name and fall before You 
 We stand in awe and say great are You, Lord 
 You lift up our voice, we say holy, holy 
 Hallelujah, to the one and only 
 Forever more, we'll say great are You, Lord 
 Through endless ages You will reign 
 Yet, every season You're the same 
 Is it any wonder? Is it any wonder? 
 The power of Your redeeming plan 
 Grace that offers life to man 
 Is it any wonder? Is it any wonder? 
 We sing great are You, Lord, for we adore You 
 Lift up Your name and fall before You 
 We stand in awe and say great are You, Lord 
 You lift up our voice, we say holy, holy 
 Hallelujah, to the one and only 
 Forever more, we'll say great are You, Lord 
 Is it any wonder, any wonder we sing 
 Any wonder we sing, oh 
 (Great are You, Lord) 
 Is it any wonder we sing 
 (Great are You, Lord) 
 Is it any wonder we sing 
 (Great are You, Lord) 
 Is it any wonder? 
 Great are You, Lord 
 (Is it any wonder?) 
 Great are You, Lord 
 (Is it any wonder?) 
 Great are You, Lord 
 We sing great are You 
 Great are You, Lord 
 (Is it any wonder?) 
 Great are You, Lord 
 (Is it any wonder?) 
 Great are You, Lord 
 We say great are You, Lord 
 Say great are You, Lord 
 Say great are You, Lord 
 Say great are You, Lord

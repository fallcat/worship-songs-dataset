Your cross gave life 
 Open salvation 
 For restoration 
 Promise for all 
 Your grace has made 
 Us part of Your kingdom 
 Living in freedom 
 As with Your son 
 Jesus Your name 
 Is alive 
 Now Your redemption draws into our lives 
 Strong in battle 
 You overcame 
 The victories ours 
 Now we sing 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 How walls fall down 
 Struggles are broken 
 Eternity spoken 
 Righteously stand 
 The church will rise 
 Declaring Your kingdom 
 Setting your freedom 
 Blood of Your lamb 
 Jesus Your name 
 Is alive 
 Now Your redemption draws into our lives 
 Strong in battle 
 You overcame 
 The victories ours 
 Now we sing 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 You reign in all the earth 
 You reign victorious 
 Your power is limitless 
 There is no one like our God 
 No one like our God 
 Yeah 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 Great, Great there is no one like our God 
 No one like Our God

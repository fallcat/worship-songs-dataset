I want to be close, close to Your side 
 So Heaven is real and death is, a lie 
 I want to hear voices of angels above 
 Singing as one 
 Hallelujah, holy, holy 
 God Almighty, the great I am 
 Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
 God Almighty, the great I am 
 I want to be near, near to Your heart 
 Loving the world and hating the dark 
 I want to see dry bones living again 
 Singing as one 
 Hallelujah, holy, holy 
 God Almighty, the great I am 
 Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
 God Almighty, the great I am 
 The mountains shake before You the demons run in fear 
 At the mention of the name King of Majesty 
 There is no power in hell 
 Or any who can stand 
 Before the power and the 
 Presence of the great I am 
 Hallelujah, holy, holy 
 God Almighty, the great I am 
 Who is worthy, none beside Thee 
 God Almighty, the great I am

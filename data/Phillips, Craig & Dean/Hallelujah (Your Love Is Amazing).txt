Your love is amazing 
 Steady and unchanging 
 Your love is a mountain 
 Firm beneath my feet 
 Your love is a mystery 
 How You gently life me 
 When I am surrounded 
 Your love carries me 
 Your love is surprising 
 I can feel it rising 
 All the joy that's growing 
 Deep inside of me 
 And every time I see you 
 All your goodness shines through 
 And I can feel this God song rising up in me 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Your love makes me sing 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Your love makes me sing 
 Your love is surprising 
 I can feel it rising 
 All the joy that's growing 
 Deep inside of me 
 And every time I see you 
 All your goodness shines through 
 And I can feel this God song rising up in me

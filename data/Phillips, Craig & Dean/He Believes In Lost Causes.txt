I see people on the street 
 With their heads hung down 
 Then I hear somebody say 
 They're just too lost to ever be found 
 But God can save the most hopeless case 
 You'd never believe all he's done 
 I've seen too many miracles 
 God knows I am one 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Common sense would just give up 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Changes people with His love 
 There's nobody too far gone 
 No one beyond his reach 
 He believes in lost causes 
 He believed in me 
 I have learned to never say 
 There's a hopeless cause 
 I just look at what I've become 
 Think back to what I was 
 When others would have given up 
 Let me go my way 
 God kept reaching out for me 
 That's why I can say 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Common sense would just give up 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Changes people with His love 
 There's nobody too far gone 
 No one beyond his reach 
 He believes in lost causes 
 He believed in me 
 (Oh yes He did) 
 He believed in me 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Common sense would just give up 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Changes people with His love 
 There's nobody too far gone 
 No one beyond his reach 
 He believes in lost causes 
 He believed in me 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Common sense would just give up 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Changes people with His love 
 There's nobody too far gone 
 No one beyond his reach 
 He believes in lost causes 
 He believed in me 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Common sense would just give up 
 He believes in lost causes 
 Changes people with His love 
 There's nobody too far gone 
 No one beyond his reach 
 He believes in lost causes 
 He believed in me

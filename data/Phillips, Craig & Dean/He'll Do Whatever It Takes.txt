"You don't know just how far 
 Away from home I've been" 
 She said, as she looked into my eyes 
 "Could it be I've strayed beyond 
 Mercy's outstretched hand 
 And now His grace no longer stoops 
 To hear my cry 
 You see, I just wanna know 
 Tell me how far will He go 
 Will He still reach for me 
 Inspite of where I've been" 
 And I told her 
 He'll do whatever, whatever it takes 
 His grace reaches lower than your worst mistakes 
 And His love will run farther 
 Than you can run away, my friend 
 He'll do whatever, whatever it takes 
 He'll do whatever it takes 
 I've heard His love is patient 
 That He always hears a prayer 
 And that His love will follow you 
 Despite the miles 
 My best years of life I wasted 
 Why would He even really care 
 What have I to give 
 That He would find worthwhile 
 You see I just wanna know 
 Tell me how far will He go 
 Will He still reach for me 
 Inspite of who I am 
 Let me tell you 
 He'll just keep reaching 
 Until He finds a way to bring you back 
 Where you belong 
 Come on back home

You don't have to say it 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 Though your heart is bruised 
 You hide the truth 
 Beneath a fine disguise 
 I've got something to tell you 
 Though it's simple it's said with love 
 Nothing new, still it's as true 
 As it ever was 
 He'll never let you go, oh no 
 That's never been His way 
 When He said that He would love you 
 He was talking about for always 
 He'll never let you go, no matter how low 
 You feel that you have fallen 
 His arms are longer still 
 And He wants you to know 
 He'll never let you go 
 You trace through your failures 
 And good intentions left behind 
 And you wonder when you'll fly again 
 You've lost the will to try 
 But there in your weakness 
 You will find the wings of the wind 
 Should you get scare, He'll be there 
 Where He's always been 
 And in the desert place where the heart can't sing 
 When your faith is shaken 
 When you can't face the morning 
 You're not on your own 
 You'll never walk alone 
 He's got you safe beneath His wings, oh

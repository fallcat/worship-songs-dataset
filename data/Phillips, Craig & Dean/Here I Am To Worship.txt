Light of the world 
 You stepped out into darkness 
 Opened my eyes, let me see 
 Beauty that made this heart adore you 
 Hope of a life spent with You 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 King of all days 
 Oh so highly exalted 
 Glorious in heaven above 
 Humbly You came to the earth You created 
 All for love's sake became poor 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me

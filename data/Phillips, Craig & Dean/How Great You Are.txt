A thousand sparkling stars upon a midnight summer sky 
 The majesty and wonder of the ocean's endless tide 
 And the more I see the more I can't explain 
 How the one who set the world in place 
 Could even know my name and I'm amazed, I'm so amazed 
 How great You are, how small I am 
 How awesome is Your mighty hand 
 And I am captured by the wonder of it all 
 And I will offer all my praise with all my heart for all my days 
 How great You are, how great You are, how great You are 
 A million snow flakes gently fall, yet no two are the same 
 For colors fill the canvas of the seasons as the change 
 And everywhere I look I see Your hand 
 Why You would love someone like me 
 I'll never understand and I'm amazed, I'm so amazed 
 How great You are, how small I am 
 How awesome is Your mighty hand 
 And I am captured by the wonder of it all 
 And I will offer all my praise with all my heart for all my days 
 How great You are, how great You are, how great You are 
 How great You are, how small I am 
 How awesome is Your mighty hand 
 And I am captured by the wonder of it all 
 And I will offer all my praise with all my heart for all my days 
 How great You are, how great You are, how great You are 
 How great You are, how small I am

It didn't take long for my whole world to change 
 One phone call now life will never be the same 
 It's like I'm watching my whole world go dark 
 Nothing makes much sense 
 But still with all my heart 
 I Choose to believe 
 And never give up hope 
 God is good 
 He's in control 
 I'll keep the faith 
 I trust in His way 
 Even when His face is hard to see 
 I choose to believe 
 It's easy to believe when everything goes our way 
 But we are all gonna go threw fire to test our faith 
 Life hurts so much that we can hardly breathe 
 We're begging to know why 
 But it's such a mystery 
 I Choose to believe 
 And never give up hope 
 God is good 
 He's in control 
 I'll keep the faith 
 I trust in His way 
 Even when His face is hard to see 
 I choose to believe 
 Yea 
 Yea 
 Even when my world is shaken 
 Even when my heart is breaking 
 Even when it seems He's taken so long 
 I Choose to believe 
 And never give up hope 
 God is good 
 He's in control 
 I'll keep the faith 
 I trust in His way 
 Even when His face is hard to see 
 I Choose to believe 
 And never give up hope 
 God is good 
 He's in control 
 I'll keep the faith 
 I trust in His way 
 Even when His face is hard to see 
 I choose to believe 
 I choose to believe 
 Jesus, Jesus how I trust Him 
 How I prove Him over and over 
 Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus 
 Over grace to trust Him more

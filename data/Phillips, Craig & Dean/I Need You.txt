Everything that I am 
 Thought I made with my own two hands 
 Had no help, caught no breaks 
 Have only myself to thank 
 Looking back at my young and foolish heart 
 Why did I keep us apart? 
 Feel this cold empty shell 
 Lord, save me from myself 
 I need you, I need you 
 I need you for real success 
 I need you for my next breath 
 Oh lord, I need you. Yes I do. 
 Oh, Lord, be my guide 
 Give real meaning to my life 
 Lead my steps, change my ways 
 Put your purpose in this place 
 Unto the hills of heaven will I lift my eyes 
 For you are my helpful saviour 
 Hear my cry 
 (Oh, I need you, got to have you Lord) 
 (Lord I lift my eyes to you) 
 (Lord I need you) 
 (Hear my cry) 
 (I need you)

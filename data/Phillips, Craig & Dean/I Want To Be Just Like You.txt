He climbs in my lap for a goodnight hug 
 He calls me Dad and I call him Bub 
 With his faded old pillow and a bear named Pooh 
 He snuggles up close and says, >I want to be like you< 
 I tuck him in bed and I kiss him goodnight 
 Trippin' over the toys as I turn out the light 
 And I whisper a prayer that someday he'll see 
 He's got a father in God 'cause he's seen Jesus in me 
 Lord, I want to be just like You 
 'Cause he wants to be just like me 
 I want to be a holy example 
 For his innocent eyes to see 
 Help me be a living Bible, Lord 
 That my little boy can read 
 I want to be just like You 
 'Cause he wants to be like me 
 Got to admit I've got so far to go 
 Make so many mistakes and I'm sure that You know 
 Sometimes it seems no matter how hard I try 
 With all the pressures in life I just can't get it all right 
 But I'm trying so hard to learn from the best 
 Being patient and kind, filled with Your tenderness 
 'Cause I know that he'll learn from the things that he sees 
 And the Jesus he finds will be the Jesus in me 
 Right now from where he stands I may seem mighty tall 
 But it's only 'cause I'm learning from the best Father of them all

Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom 
 Or the strong man boast in his strength 
 Let not the rich man boast in his riches 
 But let the humble come and give thanks 
 To the one who made us 
 The one who saved us 
 I will boast in the Lord, my God 
 I will boast in the one who's worthy 
 I will boast in the Lord, my God 
 I will boast in the one who's worthy, He is worthy 
 Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom 
 Or the strong man boast in his strength 
 Let not the rich man boast in his riches 
 But let the humble come and give thanks 
 To the one who made us 
 The one who saved us 
 I will boast in the Lord, my God 
 I will boast in the one who's worthy 
 I will boast in the Lord, my God 
 I will boast in the one who's worthy 
 I will boast in the Lord, my God 
 I will boast in the one who's worthy 
 I will boast in the Lord, my God 
 I will boast in the one who's worthy, He is worthy, worthy 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will make my boast in Christ alone 
 I will boast in the Lord, my God

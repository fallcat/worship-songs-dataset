I'm making melody 
 In my heart to You 
 I'm making melody 
 In my heart to You 
 Pouring out Your praise 
 With everything within 
 I'm making melody 
 In my heart to You 
 I'm making melody 
 In my heart to You 
 Yours will always be 
 The song I love to sing 
 How can hearts 
 Not love Your name 
 How can souls 
 Not sing Your praise 
 Jesus, You put music in my soul 
 (Repeat all) 
 Jesus, You put music in my soul

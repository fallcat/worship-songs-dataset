A scene so familiar at the old five and dime 
 The little boy waited his turn in line 
 And with eyes so intent he proudly displayed 
 The candy he'd buy with the money he'd saved 
 The girl at the counter wasn't sure what to do 
 'Cause the money was less than the price that was due 
 Then a stranger spoke up from his place in line 
 Said whatever he's short just take it and add it to mine 
 I've got you covered, I'll pay the difference 
 You don't have to worry at all 
 Whatever the cost is I'll go the distance 
 If you fail, I will catch you 
 You know I won't let you feel like you're there all alone 
 I've got you covered 
 Sometimes when I look back it's hard to explain 
 Just how far I've come yet how little has changed 
 I still long to hold what seems so out of reach 
 Only to find out it's not what it seems 
 I come to the Father alone and afraid 
 In need of forgiveness yet it's so far away 
 I cry out for mercy a child so in need 
 With a voice of compassion the Father calls out to me 
 I know what you're facing, I see where you're standing 
 I'm holding all the answers you need 
 'Cause no situation will ever take you out of My reach

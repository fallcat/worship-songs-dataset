In Christ alone my hope is found 
 He is my light, my strength, my song 
 This cornerstone, this solid ground 
 Firm through the fiercest 
 Drought and storm 
 What heights of love, 
 What depths of peace 
 When fears are stilled, 
 When strivings cease 
 My Comforter, my All in All 
 Here in the love of Christ I stand 
 In Christ Alone, who took on flesh 
 Fullness of God in helpless babe 
 This gift of love and righteousness 
 Scorned by the ones He came to save 
 Till on that cross as Jesus died 
 The wrath of God was satisfied 
 For every sin on Him was laid 
 Here in the death of Christ I live 
 There in the ground His body lay 
 Light of thw world by darkness slain 
 Then bursting forth in glorious day 
 Up from the grave he rose again 
 And as He stands in victory 
 Sin's curse has lost its grip on me 
 For I am His and He is mine 
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ 
 In Christ alone I place my trust 
 And find my glory in the power 
 Of the cross 
 In every victory let it be said of me 
 My source of strength 
 My source of hope 
 In Christ alone I place my trust 
 And find my glory in the power 
 Of the cross 
 In every victory let it be said of me 
 My source of strength 
 My source of hope 
 In Christ alone 
 No guilt in life, no fear in death 
 This is the power of Christ in me 
 From life's first cry to final breath 
 Jesus commands my destiny 
 No power of hell, no scheme of man 
 Can ever pluck me from His Hand 
 Till He returns or calls me home 
 Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

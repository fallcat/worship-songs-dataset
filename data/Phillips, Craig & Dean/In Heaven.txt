There'll be no prayers in heaven 
 Won't have to intercede 
 There'll be no cares in heaven 
 For there will be no need 
 There'll be no fear in heaven 
 Nothing left to fear 
 There'll be no tears in heaven 
 For God will wipe away each tear 
 We will feel no pain in heaven 
 Sickness will have ceased 
 We will feel no strains in heaven 
 Chains will be released 
 There'll be no blame in heaven 
 With imperfection gone 
 There'll be no shame in heaven 
 In gathering around God's throne 
 And we will be singing 
 Glory, holy 
 Blessed be the Christ our King 
 Glory, holy 
 Praise to Thy name we sing 
 Glory, holy 
 We bow down before Thee 
 Singing glory Lord eternally 
 There'll be no work in heaven 
 God's work will be complete 
 And there'll be no hurt in heaven 
 Only pleasure at His feet 
 There'll be no sin in heaven 
 Because temptation will be done 
 There will be no end in heaven 
 When eternity's begin

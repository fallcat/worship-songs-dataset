In life's complications 
 And many frustrations 
 I lost the voice that meant the most to me 
 Turn back the pages 
 To innocent ages 
 I'll search until I hear You softly speak 
 It wasn't in the thunder 
 Where I heard You call my name 
 There were no lightning flashes 
 That caused my heart to change 
 But a voice so soft and tender 
 Like the soothing summer rain 
 It wasn't in the thunder 
 Where I heard you call my name 
 Heaven's inflection 
 Life's new direction 
 You're speaking words of comfort to my life 
 You weren't in ovations 
 Or loud celebrations 
 Where I found You took me by surprise

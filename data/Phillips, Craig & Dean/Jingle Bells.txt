Jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 Dashing through the snow 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 O'er the fields we go 
 Laughing all the way 
 Bells on Bob tails ring 
 Making spirits bright 
 What fun it is to laugh and sing 
 A sleighing song tonight 
 Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells 
 Jingle all the way 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one horse open sleigh 
 Oh, what fun it is to ride 
 In a one horse open sleigh

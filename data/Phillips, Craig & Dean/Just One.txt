Ask what changes a man 
 And the answers are a dime a dozen 
 Points of view are like sand 
 Stretching out as far as the eye can see 
 There's a thousand different philosophies 
 But there's just one book 
 And there's just one name 
 With the power to heal and the grace to save 
 You can search the world for another way 
 But if you're lookin' for the road to be on 
 There's just one 
 There's too much at stake 
 To be wasting time on imitations 
 Promises and claims 
 There will never be a substitute 
 For the blood, the word, and the simple truth 
 'Cause there's just one book 
 And there's just one name 
 With the power to heal and the grace to save 
 You can search the world for another way 
 But if you're lookin' for the road to be on 
 There's just one 
 Door to open where truth and hope will be 
 Waiting there on the other side 
 Just one story that's never-ending 
 With life beginning in Jesus Christ 
 You can search the world for another way 
 But if you're lookin' for the road to be on 
 There's just one

Praise You in the morning 
 Praise You in the evening 
 When I'm young and when I'm old 
 Praise You when I'm laughing 
 Praise You when I'm grieving 
 In every season of the soul 
 If we could see how much You're worth 
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love 
 Then surely we would never cease to praise You 
 Let everything that 
 Everything that 
 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord 
 Let everything that 
 Everything that 
 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord 
 Praise You in the heavens joining with the angels 
 Praising You forever and a day 
 Praising You on the earth now joining with creation 
 Calling all the nations to Your praise 
 If they could see how much You're worth 
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love 
 Then surely they would never cease to praise You

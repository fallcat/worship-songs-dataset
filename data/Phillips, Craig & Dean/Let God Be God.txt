You said, "Lights on" 
 And a blinding sea of stars began to shine 
 You said, "Birds sing" 
 And a million melodies filled up the sky 
 You said, "This world 
 Spinning through a crowded milky way" 
 Well, the sun comes up and the sun goes down 
 And God doesn't seem to need my help 
 The one who holds the sea in place 
 Is watching out for every step I take 
 I think I'll let God be God, giving up control 
 Think I'll relax, step back, it's time for letting go 
 If You kept the universe in sync a million years or so 
 Since the keeper of creation knows, I think I'll let God be God 
 You clapped Your hands 
 The thunder rose and lightning filled the sky 
 You bring new life 
 A tiny newborn baby starts to cry 
 But time rolls in and it rolls back out 
 Never has God needed me to help 
 The one who sees the sparrow fall 
 That's what I need before I even call 
 I think I'll let God be God, giving up control 
 Think I'll relax, step back, it's time for letting go 
 If You kept the universe in sync a million years or so 
 Since the keeper of creation knows, I think I'll let God be God 
 Nothing takes You by surprise 
 Never late, always on time 
 The one who holds the sea in place 
 Is watching out for every step I take 
 I think I'll let God be God, giving up control 
 Think I'll relax, step back, time for letting go 
 If You kept the universe in sync a million years or so 
 And if the keeper of creation knows, I think I'll let God be God 
 I think I'll let God be God 
 If You kept the universe in sync a million years or so 
 Since the keeper of creation knows, I think I'll let God be God 
 I think I'll let God be God

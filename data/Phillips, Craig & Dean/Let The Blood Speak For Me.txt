Guilty as charged I stand 
 Got here by my own hand 
 I've no defense, the evidence is clear 
 Left to my own design 
 I thought the world was mine 
 But all I found were chains that bound me here 
 I can't deny I'm lost in sin 
 I could plead my own case but I would not win 
 The only hope I see are the stains of Calvary 
 So I'll let the blood speak for me 
 My heart was a prison cell 
 My sin I knew all too well 
 Condemned to face this empty place inside 
 Held captive by selfishness 
 No argument I confess 
 No pardon due for so much foolish pride 
 I can't deny I'm lost in sin 
 I could plead my own case but I would not win 
 The only hope I see are the stains of Calvary 
 So I'll let the blood speak for me 
 The blood says I am whole 
 The blood says I am clean 
 All is forgiven, I've been set free 
 So let the blood 
 Let the blood speak for me 
 The blood says I am whole 
 The blood says I am clean 
 All is forgiven, I've been set free 
 So let the blood 
 Let the blood speak for me

Freedom's song is loudest 
 If you've lived a life of chains 
 And grace is most amazing 
 In the middle of your shame 
 And hope burns at its brightest 
 When the night has been too long 
 A father's arms most welcome 
 When you've been so far from home 
 And he who's been forgiven much 
 Loves much in return 
 Let the redeemed declare it 
 Look what God has done 
 Tell of His endless mercy 
 And His everlasting love 
 Let the redeemed declare it 
 Name above all names 
 Lift high this King most holy 
 Lavish Him with praise 
 Let the redeemed 
 Arms of love feel strongest 
 When you've been so all alone 
 Faith is so surprising 
 When fear is all you've known 
 Forgiveness kiss tastes sweetest 
 When you've all but lost your way 
 And life is so much sweeter 
 If you've looked death in the face 
 The one once lost has now been found 
 The dead now lives again 
 Let the redeemed declare it 
 Look what God has done 
 Tell of His endless mercy 
 And His everlasting love 
 Let the redeemed declare it 
 Name above all names 
 Lift high this King most holy 
 Lavish Him with praise 
 Let the redeemed 
 Sing of His mercy, sing of His grace 
 Tell of His kindness, lift high His name 
 Let the redeemed declare it 
 Look what God has done 
 Tell of His endless mercy 
 And His everlasting love 
 Let the redeemed declare it 
 Name above all names 
 Lift high this King most holy 
 Lavish Him with praise 
 Let the redeemed 
 Let the redeemed 
 Sing it loud 
 Yeah, yeah

Father I see that you are drawing a line in the sand 
 And I want to be standing on your side, holding your hand 
 So let your kingdom come, let it live in me 
 This is my prayer, this is my plea 
 Father I see that you are drawing a line in the sand 
 And I want to be standing on your side, holding your hand 
 So let your kingdom come, let it live in me 
 This is my prayer, this is my plea 
 Let the worshippers arise 
 Let the sons and the daughters sing 
 I surrender in my all 
 I surrender to the King 
 Let the worshippers arise 
 Let the sons and the daughters sing 
 I surrender in my all 
 I surrender to the King 
 Father I hear it growing louder 
 The song of your redeemed 
 As the saints of every nation 
 Are awakening to sing 
 From our hearts there comes an anthem 
 Oh, hear the heavens ring 
 This is our song, a song to our King! 
 Let the worshippers arise 
 Let the sons and the daughters sing 
 I surrender in my all 
 I surrender to the King translate 
 Let the worshippers arise 
 Let the sons and the daughters sing 
 I surrender in my all 
 I surrender to the King translate 
 Let the worshippers arise 
 Let the sons and the daughters sing 
 I surrender in my all 
 I surrender to the King translate

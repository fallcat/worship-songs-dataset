You can't believe that a night could be so dark and cold 
 A buried dream, a goal unreached, you lost your hope 
 Your will to try is covered by a full eclipse of the heart 
 Tho your faith is low still the embers glow 
 Dreams can live from one small spark 
 There's a little bit of morning outside 
 There's a new beginning in the sky 
 It's been awhile, but now the time is right 
 Spread your wings and fly 
 Silent heart, sing a brand new song 
 The darkest night is just before the dawn 
 Weary soul arise, wipe the pain from your eyes 
 There's a little bit of morning outside 
 The hope He brought seemed all but lost 
 When they laid Him in the tomb 
 The dreams, the plans, the healing hands 
 Wrapped in death and gloom 
 But early Sunday morn the Promise was reborn 
 At the breaking of the day 
 He was alive and well, He conquered death and hell 
 Because He lives now we can say 
 Tho the darkness for a moment 
 May hide tomorrow's light 
 But just beyond what eye's can see 
 The light of hope is bright

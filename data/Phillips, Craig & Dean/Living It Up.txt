Okay, what are we doin'? 
 Well, I woke up early this morning 
 Like I do most every day 
 Draggin' through my daily devotions 
 In the same old usual way 
 When somewhere in between the "thees" and "thous" 
 God interrupted my quiet time 
 Leapin' off of the page and jumpin' into my heart 
 Came a more abundant life 
 I'm living it up 
 I've got a reason to celebrate 
 I'm living it up 
 Don't want to live my life any other way 
 I'm through with livin' down and out 
 I'm settin' my heart on things above 
 I've got my eyes on Jesus 
 I'm living it up 
 You can always find somebody 
 With another sad story to share 
 They can give you a million reasons 
 Why life has been so unfair 
 But life is too short to keep wastin' time 
 Talkin' 'bout the way it should've been 
 In every circumstance there's a reason to dance 
 There's a joy that God will give 
 I'm living it up 
 I've got a reason to celebrate 
 I'm living it up 
 Don't want to live my life any other way 
 I'm through with livin' down and out 
 I'm settin' my heart on things above 
 I've got my eyes on Jesus 
 I'm living it up 
 Breakin' out of my shell, I can't help myself 
 Gonna kick up my heels and dance 
 I'm living it up 
 I've got a reason to celebrate 
 I'm living it up 
 Don't want to live my life any other way 
 I'm through with livin' down and out 
 I'm settin' my heart on things above 
 I've got my eyes on Jesus 
 I'm living it up 
 I've got a reason to celebrate 
 I'm living it up 
 Don't want to live my life any other way 
 I'm through with livin' down and out 
 I'm settin' my heart on things above 
 I've got my eyes on Jesus 
 I'm living it up, yes, I am 
 I've got a reason to celebrate 
 I'm living it up 
 Don't want to live my life any other way 
 I'm living it up 
 Look, I'm living it up 
 I'm breakin' out of my shell 
 I'm living it up, I'm living it up 
 I'm living it up 
 I'm living it up 
 I'm living it up 
 I'm living it up 
 Oh, that's different!

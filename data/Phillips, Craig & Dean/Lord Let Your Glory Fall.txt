Lord, let Your glory fall 
 As on that ancient day 
 Songs of enduring love 
 And then Your glory came 
 And as a sign to You 
 That we would love the same 
 Our hearts will sing that song 
 God, let Your glory come 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 Today 
 Voices in unison 
 Giving You thanks and praise 
 Joined by the instruments 
 And then Your glory came 
 Your presence like a cloud 
 Upon that ancient day 
 The priests were overwhelmed 
 Because Your glory came 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 You are good, You are good 
 And Your love endures 
 Today 
 Oh, Your anger lasts a moment 
 But Your favor lasts a lifetime 
 Your anger lasts a moment 
 But Your favor lasts a lifetime 
 A sacrifice was made 
 And then Your fire came 
 They knelt upon the ground 
 And with one voice they praised

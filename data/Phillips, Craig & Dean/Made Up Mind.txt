If you think that you've lost your goal 
 If you think that your life is out of control 
 Don't you know 
 You've got to have a made up mind 
 If indecision is pained your heart 
 Hold on to the truth, make a new start 
 Don't you know 
 You've got to have a made up mind 
 You've got to have courage in the night 
 Cling to what is right 
 Keeping it between the lines, yeah 
 You've got to be faithful to the truth 
 God is gonna move 
 Through a soul with a made up mind 
 If confusion is at your door 
 Don't let him put one foot on the floor 
 Don't you know 
 You've got to have a made up mind 
 If pride takes you by the hand 
 Let it go, hit your knees, take a stand 
 Don't you know 
 You've got to have a made up mind 
 You've got to have courage in the night 
 Cling to what is right 
 Keeping it between the lines, yeah 
 You've got to be faithful to the truth 
 God is gonna move 
 Through a soul with a made up mind 
 (solo) 
 You've got to have courage in the night 
 Cling to what is right 
 Keeping it between the lines, yeah 
 You've got to be faithful to the truth 
 God is gonna move 
 Through a soul with a made up mind 
 Run the race, don't be looking around, no no 
 You'll win the prize if you don't back down. 
 Don't you know 
 You've got to have a made up mind 
 Don't you know 
 You've got to have a made up mind

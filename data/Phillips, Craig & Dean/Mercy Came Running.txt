Once there was a holy place 
 Evidence of God's embrace 
 And I can almost see mercy's face 
 Pressed against the veil 
 Looking down with longing eyes 
 Mercy must have realized 
 That once His blood was sacrificed 
 Freedom would prevail 
 And as the sky grew dark 
 And the earth began to shake 
 With justice no longer in the way 
 Mercy came running 
 Like a prisoner set free 
 Past all my failures 
 To the point of my need 
 When the sin that I carried 
 Was all I could see 
 And when I could not reach mercy 
 Mercy came running to me 
 Once there was a broken heart 
 Way too human from the start 
 And all the years left you torn apart 
 Hopeless and afraid 
 Walls I never meant to build 
 Left this prisoner unfulfilled 
 Freedom called but even still 
 It seemed so far away 
 I was bound by the chains 
 From the wages of my sin 
 Just when I felt like giving in 
 Mercy came running 
 Like a prisoner set free 
 Past all my failures 
 To the point of my need 
 When the sin that I carried 
 Was all I could see 
 And when I could not reach mercy 
 Mercy came running to me 
 Sometimes I still feel so far 
 So far from where I really should be 
 He gently calls to my heart 
 Just to remind me 
 Mercy came running 
 Like a prisoner set free 
 Past all my failures 
 To the point of my need 
 When the sin that I carried 
 Was all I could see 
 And when I could not reach mercy 
 Mercy came running 
 Mercy came running 
 Like a prisoner set free 
 Past all my failures 
 To the point of my need 
 When the sin that I carried 
 Was all I could see 
 And when I could not reach mercy 
 Mercy came running 
 Mercy came running 
 Like a prisoner set free 
 Past all my failures 
 To the point of my need 
 When the sin that I carried 
 Was all I could see 
 And when I could not reach mercy 
 Mercy came running

Mama always got up early 
 And she never went to bed till late 
 Yet, I never heard her complainin' 
 About her family of eight 
 There were times she should have been sleepin' 
 But, late in the midnight hour 
 She'd get down on her knees 
 And you could hear her say, 
 "Lord fill them will your power" 
 Mama like to burn the midnight oil 
 Down on her knees in prayer 
 If you asked why she did it 
 She said she did it care she cared 
 Now Mama always talked to Jesus 
 When she knelt by her rocking chair 
 Oh, I'm glad my mama was willin' 
 To burn the midnight oil in prayer 
 Now Mama's gone to be with Jesus 
 I've got a family of my own 
 Yet, whenever the clock strikes midnight 
 You will find me all alone 
 That's when I start to call upon Jesus 
 For His wisdom and His power 
 Cause it seems that He loves 
 To hear a Daddy's prayer 
 Even in the midnight hour 
 Years from now, when my grown little boy 
 Has a family of his own 
 Will he kneel down and pray 
 When the hour gets late 
 And pass the legacy on 
 Cause now there's a Daddy who's willing 
 To burn the midnight oil in prayer

What can take a dying man 
 And raise him up to life again 
 What can heal the wounded soul 
 What can make us white as snow 
 What can fill the emptiness 
 What can mend our brokenness 
 Brokenness 
 Mighty 
 Awesome 
 Wonderful 
 Is the Holy Cross 
 Where the Lamb laid down His life 
 To lift us from the fall 
 Mighty is the power of the cross 
 What restores our faith in God 
 What reveals the Father's love 
 What can lead the wayward home 
 What can melt a heart of stone 
 What can free the guilty ones 
 What can save and overcome (overcome) 
 Mighty 
 Awesome 
 Wonderful 
 Is the Holy Cross 
 Where the Lamb laid down His life 
 To lift us from the fall 
 Mighty is the power of the cross 
 It's a miracle to me 
 And it's still a mystery 
 It's a miracle to me 
 The Power of God for those who believe 
 Mighty 
 Awesome 
 Wonderful 
 Is the Holy Cross 
 Where the Lamb laid down His life 
 To lift us from the fall 
 Mighty is the power of the cross

Lord, I wish I could praise You 
 With adequate words 
 But You leave me speechless 
 And I so long to sing You 
 The song You deserve 
 But it would be endless 
 I long to move Your heart 
 I bring You something new 
 I tell how great You are 
 Tell my praise to You 
 It's like an ocean breeze 
 Blowing on your face 
 Like a summer sun 
 With its warm embrace 
 Like a gentle rain 
 Plays a symphony 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be 
 Like a fragrant rose 
 In the early spring 
 Like an eagle soars 
 When it spreads its wings 
 Whatever, Lord 
 You may need from me 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be to You 
 Everything I could give 
 You already possess 
 Lord, I'm so unworthy, yeah 
 I'm just one of the millions 
 To stand and confess 
 And yet still You hear me 
 Your heart is open wide 
 You long for what I bring 
 I pray somehow You'll find 
 This simple offering 
 It's like an ocean breeze 
 Blowing on your face 
 Like a summer sun 
 With its warm embrace 
 Like a gentle rain 
 Plays a symphony 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be 
 Like a fragrant rose 
 In the early spring 
 Like an eagle soars 
 When it spreads its wings 
 Whatever, Lord 
 You may need from me 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be to You 
 Lord, I want my praise to be 
 Like the breeze summer, spring 
 Lord, I want my praise to be 
 Like the eagle spreads its wings 
 It's like an ocean breeze 
 Blowing on your face 
 Like a summer sun 
 With its warm embrace 
 Like a gentle rain 
 Plays a symphony 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be 
 Like a fragrant rose 
 In the early spring 
 Like an eagle soars 
 When it spreads its wings 
 Whatever, Lord 
 You may need from me 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be 
 It's like an ocean breeze 
 Blowing on your face 
 Just like a summer sun 
 With its warm embrace 
 Like a gentle rain 
 Plays a symphony 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be 
 Like a fragrant rose 
 In the early spring 
 Like an eagle soars 
 When it spreads its wings 
 Whatever, Lord 
 You may need from me 
 That's what I want 
 My praise to be to You 
 Lord, I want my praise to be 
 Like the breeze the summer, spring 
 Lord, I want my praise to be 
 Like the eagle spreads its wings

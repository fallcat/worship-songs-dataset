I know You rescued my soul 
 His blood has covered my sin 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 My shame He's taken away 
 My pain is healed in His name 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I'll raise a banner 
 'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 I know You rescued my soul 
 His blood has covered my sin 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 My shame He's taken away 
 My pain is healed in His name 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I'll raise a banner 
 'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 You lift my burdens 
 And I'll rise with You 
 I'm dancing on this mountaintop to see Your kingdom come 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives

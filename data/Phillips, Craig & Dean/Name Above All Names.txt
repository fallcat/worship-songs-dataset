There is a name, with power to save 
 That will never end 
 There is a love, that conquered the grave 
 That brings new life again 
 A song is rising, all creation sings 
 King of glory, Lord creator 
 Worthy of our everlasting praise 
 Great redeemer, beautiful savior 
 Jesus, the name above all names 
 No other name, could ever bring hope 
 To a broken heart 
 Nothing compares, or even comes close 
 To how wonderful you are 
 A song is rising, forever we will say 
 You are never ending, everlasting king 
 There is no other name 
 So let your praises ring

I thought that I had crossed the line 
 Walked away from love one time 
 Too many 
 I thought I'd used up all the grace 
 Set aside for my mistakes 
 So many 
 On my knees I found to my surprise 
 That your mercy renewed with the sunrise 
 You make Your mercy new every day 
 You change my life in so many ways 
 You cradle me in Your sweet grace 
 You fill me 
 Yesterday, today, forever more 
 There's one thing I know for sure 
 Fresh as the morning dew 
 You make Your mercy new 
 Every morning 
 Oh the wasted times that I have known 
 A prodigal away from home 
 Not knowing 
 Every day Your grace was multiplied 
 With forgiveness waiting to provide 
 To save the entire world 
 How much grace would it take 
 When the sun comes up 
 There will be enough

I watched you as you stumbled out of bed 
 Rushed out the dooryour coffeee in your hand 
 And you looked so lost and lonely 
 I knew I had to find a way 
 To make you understand, I wanna be your friend 
 So I painted a sunrise in the sky 
 And I caused the birds to sing you lullabies 
 And I whispered sweet "I love you's" 
 In the breeze that brushed your face 
 You didn't even see, you never noticed Me 
 No matter how long it takes, somehow I'll find a way 
 No matter how far you run, there's no distance that's too great 
 'Cause when the wind blows through the treetops 
 And in the music of the rain 
 Somehow My love will find a way 
 No Matter how long it takes 
 I watched you as you fell asleep last night 
 And I trembled as I watched the tears you cried 
 So I splashed your face with moonlight, and I longed for your embrace 
 You never called My name, I loved you just the same 
 In the laughter of the children 
 I'll be calling out your name 
 Somehow My love will find a way 
 Somehow My love will find a way 
 My love will find a way 
 No matter how long it takes

I lay my life down at Your feet 
 You're the only one I need 
 I turn to You and You're always there 
 In troubled times it's You I seek 
 I put You first that's all I need 
 I humble all I am, all to You 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 You are always, always there 
 Every how and everywhere 
 Your grace abounds so deeply within me 
 So You will never ever change 
 Yesterday today the same 
 Forever till forever meets no end 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 You are the way, the truth and the life 
 We live by faith and not by sight for You 
 We're living all for You 
 You are the way, the truth and the life 
 We live by faith and not by sight for You 
 We're living all for You 
 You are the way, the truth and the life 
 We live by faith and not by sight for You 
 We're living all for You 
 You are the way 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 One way Jesus 
 You're the only one that I could live for 
 I could live for

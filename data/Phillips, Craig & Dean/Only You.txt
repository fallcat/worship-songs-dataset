Only You, You alone 
 Are worthy of the glory, Lord 
 And every crown we'll ever wear 
 We lay it down 
 We bow our knees, we confess 
 You are Lord all by Yourself 
 You reign alone upon Your throne of righteousness 
 Only You 
 Who is like the Lord our God 
 Who reigns in majesty? 
 Who formed the earth 
 And the heavens above 
 The mountains, the deserts and seas? 
 Who deserves honor? 
 Who deserves praise? 
 Who is the sovereign King? 
 Who is like the Lord our God? 
 Who lifts those of low degree 
 And who by His grace and faithfulness 
 He calls us His family? 
 And who deserves honor? 
 And who deserves praise? 
 And who is the sovereign King? 
 We cry holy is the Lord 
 We cry worthy is the Lamb 
 We cry holy is the Lord 
 We exalt the great I Am

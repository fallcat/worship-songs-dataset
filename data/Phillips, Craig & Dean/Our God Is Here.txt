I come broken 
 I come weary 
 But You give me rest 
 I come waiting 
 I come needing 
 But in You I trust 
 Cause There's never been a mountain that You can't move 
 There's never been a battle He could lose 
 Only God of hope would ever say 
 When we put our faith in the one who says 
 Mountains move, Giants lose 
 Dead men walk out of empty tombs 
 We lift our eyes to the King of Kings 
 He's is willing to fight over everything 
 It's so clear, There's no fear 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 We come hopin' 
 We come knowing 
 Your on our Side, ooh 
 Protected 
 Our defender 
 You want this fight 
 There's never been a giant standing down 
 There's never been a cross that kept You down 
 Only God of hope would ever say 
 When we put our faith in the one who says 
 Mountains move, Giants lose 
 Dead men walk out of empty tombs 
 We lift our eyes to the King of Kings 
 He's is willing to fight over everything 
 It's so clear, There's no fear 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 Yea, whoa 
 The Lord is my rock 
 My salvation I won't fee 
 The Lord is my refuge and my shield 
 He's right here 
 He's right here 
 Only God of hope would ever say 
 When we put our faith in the one who says 
 Mountains move, Giants lose 
 Dead men walk out of empty tombs 
 We lift our eyes to the King of Kings 
 He's is willing to fight over everything 
 It's so clear, There's no fear 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here 
 There's no fear cause our God is here

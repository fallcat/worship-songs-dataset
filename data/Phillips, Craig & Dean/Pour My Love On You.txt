I don't know how to say exactly how I feel 
 And I can't begin to tell you what your love has meant 
 I'm lost for words 
 Is there a way to show the passion in my heart 
 Can I express how truly great I think you are 
 You're my dearest friend 
 Lord this is my desire to pour my love on you 
 Like oil upon your feet 
 Like wine for you to drink 
 Life water from my heart 
 I pour my love on you 
 With praises like the perfume 
 I lavish mine on you 
 Till every drop is gone 
 I pour my love on you 
 Is there a way to show the passion in my heart 
 Can I express how truly great I think you are, 
 My dearest friend 
 Lord this is my desire to pour my love on you

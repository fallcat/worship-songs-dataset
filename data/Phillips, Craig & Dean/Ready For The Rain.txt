I'm ready for the rain 
 I'm ready for a chance to grow 
 It's those showers from above 
 That make the river flow 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 I'm gonna face the storm head on 
 Though it drives me to my knees 
 That's where I'm made strong 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 I always ran for cover 
 When the stormy clouds 
 Come rolling down my way, yeah 
 The sound of distant thunder 
 It would shake my world 
 And make my heart afraid 
 But I watched my faith grow stronger 
 With every storm that I walked through 
 And the blessing of it all 
 Is that it brought me close to You 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 I'm ready for a chance to grow 
 It's those showers from above 
 That make the river flow 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 I'm gonna face the storm head on 
 Though it drives me to my knees 
 That's where I'm made strong 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 It seems with every drop that falls 
 A little more of heaven lives in me 
 It gives me faith to see a dim reflection 
 Of the man I dream to be 
 When the sun comes out tomorrow 
 I'll stand here as living proof 
 There is a blessing in the rain 
 Because it makes me more like You 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 I'm ready for a chance to grow 
 It's those showers from above 
 That make the river flow 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 I'm gonna face the storm head on 
 Though it drives me to my knees 
 That's where I'm made strong 
 Even if those showers fall 
 You're still Lord above it all 
 So I'll look up to You 
 For the grace to get me through 
 I think I see some rain coming 
 Lord, make me strong 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 (Oh, I see the rain coming) 
 I'm ready for a chance to grow 
 It's those showers from above 
 That make the river flow 
 (Oh, keep it flowing) 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 I'm gonna face the storm head on 
 Though it drives me to my knees 
 That's where I'm made strong 
 Oh, make me strong 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 Ready for the rain, yeah 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 It's gonna make me stronger 
 So much stronger 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 Ready for the rain, yeah 
 I'm ready for the rain 
 Ooh-ooh...

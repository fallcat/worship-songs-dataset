Yeah, yeah 
 Keep on cruising to the pace society accepts 
 Staying steady, well conformed 
 But I must confess 
 I'm uncomfortable in this comfort zone 
 I'm ready for some risk 
 Let's cross some lines ad make some waves 
 Give this road a little twist 
 What do you say we betray this boulevard 
 How 'bout we go over the curb 
 And through the yard 
 Give this beaten path a goodbye wave 
 No more playin' it safe 
 What do you say we close our eyes 
 Let go of the wheel 
 Take a reckless ride of faith 
 I have tried to steer the way 
 It's time to let it go 
 Takin' Jesus at His word 
 That He will take control 
 So let's mash the gas for what we believe 
 And land where we end up 
 'Cause we can't taste the thrill of faith 
 Unless we're racing for the cup 
 What do you say we betray this boulevard 
 How 'bout we go over the curb 
 And through the yard 
 Give this beaten path a goodbye wave 
 No more playin' it safe 
 What do you say we close our eyes 
 Let go of the wheel 
 Take a reckless ride of faith 
 'Cause what's the point in fitting in 
 Going with the flow 
 Let's turn some heads, engage debate 
 And dare to jump this road 
 What do you say we betray this boulevard 
 How 'bout we go over the curb 
 And through the yard 
 Give this beaten path a goodbye wave 
 No more playin' it safe 
 What do you say we close our eyes 
 Let go of the wheel 
 Take a reckless ride of faith 
 Take a reckless ride of faith, yeah

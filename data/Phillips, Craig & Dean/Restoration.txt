Galatians 6:1-3 (KJV) 
 Looking at this falling race 
 Standing in the light of grace 
 We can't see the shadow of the past 
 Building our security 
 Truth lost its identity 
 But there's still time for us to get it back 
 If we sing hey now, hey now 
 And take some time for self examination 
 Say hey now, hey now 
 We need to be baptized in salvation 
 If we sing hey now, hey now 
 What we need is restoration 
 Hey now, hey now 
 What we really need is restoration 
 Twisted in this awful mess 
 Swimming in our own success 
 Watching as the truth just fades away 
 It's time to put our faith to test 
 Let our souls be undressed 
 And show the world we mean what we say 
 Staring somewhere into space 
 Hoping to find some saving grace 
 I flet a tug within my heart 
 You roll the stone, pull me apart 
 Your light illuminates the dark 
 And makes my voice cry out loud

There are no words to describe 
 Who You are, Jesus Christ 
 No one compares 
 No one compares 
 Traded Your crown for cross and thorns 
 Defeated death, now we're reborn 
 What can we say 
 What can we say 
 You leave us speechless, breathless 
 Jesus, worthy, worthy 
 There is no one like You, God 
 No one like You, God 
 You love is matchless, endless for us 
 Holy, Holy 
 There is no one like You, God 
 No one like You, God 
 We can't help but fall down 
 Under the weight of Your mercy now 
 You're here with us 
 You're here with us 
 Surrounded by Your majesty 
 Amazing Grace, we're on our knees 
 What can we say 
 What can we say 
 You leave us speechless, breathless 
 Jesus, worthy, worthy 
 There is no one like You, God 
 No one like You, God 
 The splendor of Your mighty love 
 Is freeing us, is healing us 
 The splendor of Your mighty love 
 Is freeing us, is healing us 
 The splendor of Your mighty love 
 Is freeing us, is healing us 
 The splendor of Your mighty love 
 Is freeing us, is healing us 
 You leave us speechless, breathless 
 Jesus, worthy, worthy 
 There is no one like You, God 
 No one like You, God 
 You leave us speechless 
 Oh, Jesus 
 You leave us speechless 
 You leave us speechless 
 Speechless, oh Jesus 
 You leave us speechless 
 You leave us speechless

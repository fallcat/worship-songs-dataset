I've got a friend who says 
 He's gonna build a house 
 He's in love with a pretty lady 
 Now he's ready to settle down 
 I wonder if he knows 
 It takes more than wood or stone 
 To build a house that will stand 
 When the storms begin to blow 
 'Cause in the course of a life 
 Things don't always go as planned 
 And the dreams that began 
 With a kiss and a prayer 
 Can slip right through your hands 
 It takes a strong determination 
 A trust that never dies 
 The courage to forgive 
 And a heart that reconciles 
 A life full of devotion 
 A faith that won't give up 
 It takes a strong determination 
 To build a house of love 
 Yes, it's been said before 
 'Cause it's forever true 
 Good things take a lot of patience 
 If you're gonna see them through 
 So much depends on us 
 And what we invest through the years 
 When the fire is an ember 
 When the laughter's touched by tears 
 'Cause it's easy to love 
 When you've just fallen in 
 But the years take a toll 
 And you've got to hold on 
 To finish what you begin 
 It takes a strong determination 
 A trust that never dies 
 The courage to forgive 
 And a heart that reconciles 
 A life full of devotion 
 A faith that won't give up 
 It takes a strong determination 
 To build a house of love 
 A life full of devotion 
 A faith that won't give up 
 It takes a strong determination 
 To build a house of love

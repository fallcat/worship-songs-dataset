Hear the good news, you've been invited 
 No matter what others may say, 
 Your darkest sins will be forgiven 
 You will always have a place. 
 At the table of grace the cup's never empty. 
 The plate's always full and it's never too late. 
 To come and be filled with love never ending 
 You're always welcome at the table of grace. 
 So come weak, and heavy hearted (heavy hearted) 
 Don't try to hide your earthly scars. 
 In His eyes, we all are equal (yes, we are) 
 Don't be afraid, come as you are. 
 At the table of grace the cup's never empty. 
 The plate's always full, and it's never too late. 
 To come and be filled with love never ending

 So let the first become the last 
 Let the poor put kings to shame. 
 Their willing hearts will be their treasure 
 By the power of Jesus' name! 
 At the table of grace the cup's never empty 
 The plate's always full, and it's never too late! 
 To come and be filled with love never ending 
 You're always welcome at the table of grace 
 At the table of grace the cup's never empty.

 You're always welcome at the table. 
 Everyone's welcome at the table of grace.

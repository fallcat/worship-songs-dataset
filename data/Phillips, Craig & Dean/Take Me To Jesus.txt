Jasper wallpaper, gates of pearl 
 Never seen nothing like it in this world 
 Rainbow of splendor 'round a glass throne 
 Ten lane highway paved with gold 
 Angel choir singing with a mighty band 
 In sweetest harmony "Holy is the Lamb" 
 I know the tour ain't over, but excuse me please 
 I've come a long, long way, one thing to see 
 Take me to Jesus 
 Let me bow down 
 Take me to Jesus 
 Let me hand Him my crown 
 Take me to Jesus 
 That will make heaven, heaven to me 
 Hello, David, I've sung your songs 
 Ezekiel, I have preached about them dry bones 
 Peter, can you tell me 
 How you walked upon the sea? 
 Oh, it's been a pleasure to meet all of you 
 And I hope that you don't think that I'm rude 
 Seeing all my heroes ain't top priority 
 I want to see the man that died for me 
 I've heard it's a land 
 Where milk and honey flow 
 I've never cared for milk 
 And honey's too sweet, you know 
 The sights, the sound, the splendor 
 You can take it all away 
 What will make heaven heaven 
 Is when I see Him face to face

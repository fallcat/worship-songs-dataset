Forgiven 
 If only you'd forgive yourself 
 You've been made new 
 But you're standing where you fell 
 Because when you look in the mirror 
 It seems like all you ever see 
 Are the scars of every failure 
 And the you that you used to be 
 Tell your heart to beat again 
 Close your eyes and breathe it in 
 Let the shadows fall away 
 You'll live to love another day 
 Yesterday's a closing door 
 And you don't live there anymore 
 So say goodbye to where you've been 
 And tell your heart to beat again 
 Forgiven 
 Just let that word wash over you 
 It's all right now 
 Love's healing hands have pulled you through 
 So, get back up and take step one 
 And now you're new life has begun 
 And know that if the Son has set you free 
 Then you are free indeed! 
 Tell your heart to beat again 
 Close your eyes and breathe it in 
 Let the shadows fall away 
 You'll live to love another day 
 Yesterday's a closing door 
 And you don't live there anymore 
 So say goodbye to where you've been 
 And tell your heart to beat again 
 Hope is reaching from a rugged cross 
 Where a perfect love recaptured all the innocence that's lost 
 And mercy's calling from an empty grave 
 So life your eyes to heaven 
 And hear your Savior say 
 Tell your heart to beat again 
 Close your eyes and breathe it in 
 Let the shadows fall away 
 You'll live to love another day 
 Yesterday's a closing door 
 And you don't live there anymore 
 So say goodbye to where you've been 
 And tell your heart to beat again

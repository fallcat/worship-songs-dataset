I brushed some pine needles off of memories today 
 My fingers traced a stone, etched with a date and a name 
 Of a simple country lady, so gentle yet so strong 
 Her memory floods my heart as I recall 
 She didn't have a lot, but there was something that she knew 
 And it meant the world when she would say "Son, I'll pray for you" 
 And whenever she would kneel beside her little rocking chair 
 She'd turn her simple home into a holy house of prayer 
 And though she's gone away 
 There's something that I really want to say 
 Thank you for praying, praying for me 
 I never could repay the time you spent down on your knees 
 I'm where I am today because you chose to pray and intercede 
 Thank you for praying, praying for me 
 Everyone has someone in your life you can recall 
 A constant source of strength for you whenever you would fall 
 And when you felt so lonely in times of desperate needs 
 You knew that you could count on them to be down on their knees 
 To our heroes of the faith 
 There's something that we all would love to say 
 Thank you for praying, praying for me 
 I never could repay the time you spent down on your knees 
 I'm where I am today because you chose to pray and intercede 
 Thank you for praying 
 And when that day comes and all things will be revealed 
 And our Father lets us see with open eyes 
 He will understand that we were carried on the wings 
 Of the prayers of faithful people in our lives 
 Thank you for praying, praying for me 
 I never could repay the time you spent down on your knees 
 I'm where I am today because you chose to pray and intercede 
 Thank you for praying, praying for me 
 Holy, holy

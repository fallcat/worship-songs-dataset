King in the skies, thorns on His head 
 And a robe dipped in red 
 Meek as a lamb, mocked as a fool 
 On a road that leads to death 
 The heavens are shaking 
 My heart is crying 
 That's my Lord, that's my king 
 That's my hope, my everything 
 That's my Lord, that's my rock 
 That's my Savior, that's my God 
 Jesus, oh Jesus, that's my Lord 
 Fire in His eyes, a crown on His head 
 And a sword dipped in red 
 Saints by His side, all dressed in white 
 He is coming like He said 
 Angels are dancing 
 And my heart is singing 
 That's my Lord, that's my king 
 That's my hope, my everything 
 That's my Lord, that's my rock 
 That's my Savior, that's my God 
 Jesus, oh Jesus 
 The kingdoms of this world 
 Are the kingdoms of our God 
 The nations of the earth 
 Cries out and say 
 He's our Lord, He's our king 
 He's our hope, our everything 
 He's our Lord, He's our rock 
 He's our Savior, He's our God 
 Jesus, oh Jesus, Jesus, oh Jesus 
 That's our Lord 
 That's our Lord, that's our king 
 That's our hope, our everything 
 That's our Lord, oh, that's our rock 
 That's our Savior, that's our God

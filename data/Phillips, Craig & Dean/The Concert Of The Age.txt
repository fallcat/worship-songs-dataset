The stars become as lasers 
 And all the worlds align 
 Horizon to horizon 
 A rainbow begins to rise 
 Sudden sounds like thunder 
 Come from everywhere 
 As the angel Michael 
 Kicks the countdown on the snare 
 Across the sea of faces 
 Shouts of praise begin to roll 
 As we see the silhouette 
 Of the King of heart and soul 
 At the concert of the age 
 The great I AM takes center stage 
 The generations stand amazed 
 At the concert of the age 
 Then a voice like a trumpet 
 Blows through me like the wind 
 Gabriel cries, "Welcome home, 
 We're ready to begin" 
 We know you heard Beethoven 
 And the king of rock-n-roll 
 But on behalf of the Father 
 We give you the King of heart and soul 
 At the concert of the age 
 The great I AM takes center stage 
 The generations stand amazed 
 At the concert of the age 
 At the concert of the age 
 The great I AM takes center stage 
 The generations stand amazed 
 At the concert of the age 
 We cry Holy, holy, holy, 
 Lord God Almighty 
 With every note He plays 
 At the concert of the age 
 The great I AM takes center stage 
 The generations stand amazed 
 At the concert of the age 
 (Repeat)

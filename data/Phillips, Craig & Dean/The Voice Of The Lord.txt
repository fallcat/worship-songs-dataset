Whose voice is this that is over the water 
 That thunders and shakes the mountains and plains? 
 Whose voice is this that skips 'cross the desert? 
 The wilderness sings at the sound of Your name 
 Whose voice is full of wonder? 
 And majesty untold 
 Whose voice is this that is calling the nation 
 To rise up and praise You with great shouts of joy? 
 And whose voice is this that has called me from darkness 
 And chose me before the foundation was laid? 
 Whose voice is this that calls me beloved 
 And tells me I'm free and my debt has been paid? 
 Whose voice is full of wonder? 
 And majesty untold 
 (Majesty untold) 
 And whose voice is this that is calling His children 
 To rise up and praise Him with great shouts of joy? 
 The voice of the Lord is calling His children 
 (The voice of the Lord) 
 The voice of the Lord is shaking the earth 
 The voice of the Lord echoes like thunder 
 (The voice of the Lord) 
 Is awesome in glory 
 Hear, hear the voice of the Lord, yeah, yeah 
 Let those who have an end 
 Hear His mighty voice 
 His voice is deep inside my soul 
 The voice of the Lord is calling His children 
 (The voice of the Lord) 
 The voice of the Lord is shaking the earth 
 The voice of the Lord echoes like thunder 
 (The voice of the Lord) 
 Is awesome in glory, hear 
 The voice of the Lord is calling His children 
 (The voice of the Lord) 
 The voice of the Lord is shaking the earth 
 The voice of the Lord echoes like thunder 
 (The voice of the Lord) 
 Is awesome in glory 
 Hear, hear the voice of the Lord 
 Hear, hear the voice of the Lord, yeah, yeah

When I survey the wondrous cross 
 On which the Prince of Glory died 
 My richest gain I count but loss 
 And pour contempt on all my pride 
 Oh, the wonderful cross 
 Oh, the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die 
 And find that I may truly live 
 See from his head, His hands, His feet 
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down 
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown 
 Oh, the wonderful cross 
 Oh, the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die 
 And find that I may truly live 
 Oh, the wonderful cross 
 Oh, the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here 
 By grace draw near and bless Your name 
 Love so amazing, so divine 
 Demands my soul, my life, my all.

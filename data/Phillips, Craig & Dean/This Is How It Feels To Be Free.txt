There is a wall that has been standing 
 Since the day that Adam fell 
 Sin is where it started 
 And sin is why it held 
 Speaking as a prisoner 
 Who was there and lived to tell 
 I remember how it felt 
 I could here the sound of freedom 
 Like a distant voice it called 
 And beckoned me to follow 
 Where I had never gone 
 And though my heart is willing 
 I just stood there at the wall 
 Praying somehow it would fall 
 But in a cross I found a doorway 
 And a hand that held a key 
 And when the chains fell at my feet 
 For the first time I could see 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 This is what it means to know that 
 I am forgiven 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 To see that life can be more than I imagined 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 There are days when I'm reminded 
 Of the prison I was in 
 Like a living nightmare 
 Burning from within 
 I can feel the voice of evil 
 I can hear the call of sin 
 But I won't go back again 
 See, once I've tasted freedom 
 Then the walls could bind no more 
 Since mercy gave me wings to fly 
 Like an eagle I can soar 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 This is what it means to know that 
 I am forgiven 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 To see that life can be more than I imagined 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 Somewhere there's a prison 
 Where the chains still bind 
 There but for the grace of God 
 Those walls could still be mine 
 So for all the captives, I say... 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 This is what it means to know that 
 I am forgiven 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 To see that life can be more than I imagined 
 This is how it feels to be free 
 This is how it feels to be free

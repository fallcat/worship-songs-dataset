This life is the life that I've chosen 
 Nobody made me do it 
 Feels right, givin' all my devotion 
 Take it from a man who's had a taste of both sides 
 There's no sweeter freedom than a godly life 
 I just wanna testify 
 This is the life 
 I'm where I wanna be 
 Livin' from the center of a heart that's free 
 Oh, I'm feelin' all right 
 Day or night, rain or shine 
 This is the life 
 You think it's a dull life I'm livin' 
 Yeah, you say it's such a pity 
 So weak, to need a crutch of religion 
 Pardon me a minute but I think I need to say 
 I don't need your sympathy so don't be talkin' that way 
 You will see the light some day 
 Now I'm not sayin' that I never had a bad day 
 But since I've been livin' for Jesus 
 This is what I have to say

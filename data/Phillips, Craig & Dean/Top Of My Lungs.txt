Words of worship 
 Rise like a river within me 
 The thoughts to express are so many 
 Wanna bless You God 
 Can't be silent 
 I think of the mercies You show me 
 My lips begin overflowing 
 Great is Your love 
 Such gratitude for all that You do 
 Jesus to You 
 At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah 
 You're the one who saved me 
 The one who gave me this life I live 
 For evermore, for evermore 
 At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah 
 I'm not ashamed, I'll praise Your name 
 Let the whole world know, I love You, Lord 
 I love You, Lord 
 You are worthy 
 I join the song of creation 
 That rings out across every nation 
 Let my heart be heard 
 I need You so, I don't care who knows 
 From the depths of my soul 
 At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah 
 You're the one who saved me 
 The one who gave me this life I live 
 For evermore, for evermore 
 At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah 
 I'm not ashamed, I'll praise Your name 
 Let the whole world know, I love You, Lord 
 I love You, Lord 
 Let my love be loud 
 A sweet joyful noise 
 Only for You I lift up my voice 
 I lift up my voice 
 At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah 
 You're the one who saved me 
 The one who gave me this life I live 
 For evermore, for evermore 
 At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah 
 I'm not ashamed, I'll praise Your name 
 Let the whole world know, I love You, Lord 
 I love You, Lord, yeah

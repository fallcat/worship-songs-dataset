I've been kind of down today 
 Kind of like I can't quite make it 
 The pressure of a fast-track world 
 Is hard to handle now and then 
 I haven't got a lot to say 
 And I've resolved that I won't take it anymore 
 I know that somethin' good is movin' in me 
 That's when I feel the music 
 Soothe the savage beast 
 I hear the love, I find release 
 Turn up the radio 
 And sing a song of sympathy 
 Turn up the radio 
 Let freedom ring in harmony 
 I hear the healing go 
 To the secret place only God can know 
 Turn up the radio! 
 Turn up the Radio! 
 Don't you know I make mistakes? 
 And I can surely feel forsaken 
 The pressure of a fast paced race 
 Hurts my already broken Heart 
 When the road is headed down and out 
 And desire love's forgiveness 
 His Spirit calls my name again and again 
 That's when I feel His music 
 Soothe the savage beast 
 I hear my Lord, I find His peace 
 Let a message of hope sink in 
 Feel a fire of life begin 
 Break out the chains 
 Sing a sweet refrain

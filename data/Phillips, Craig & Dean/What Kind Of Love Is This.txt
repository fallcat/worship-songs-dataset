What kind of love is this 
 That climbs the hill 
 That bears the cross 
 That takes the nails 
 What kind of love is this 
 That takes my place 
 That gives His life 
 And clears my name 
 Oh, I want to know 
 What kind of love is this 
 It's wonderful 
 It's glorious 
 It's full of grace 
 And full of mercy 
 Powerful 
 It's marvelous 
 That's what this love is 
 That's what God's love is 
 What kind of love is this 
 That cries alone 
 That tastes of death 
 To bring me home 
 Oh, I want to know 
 What kind of love this is 
 What kind of love is this 
 That fills my soul 
 That lifts me up 
 And makes me whole 
 What kind of love is this 
 That gives me hope 
 That dries my tears 
 And brings me joy 
 Oh, I want to know 
 What kind of love this is 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 He's full of grace 
 And full of mercy 
 Jesus, my Jesus 
 This is what love is 
 That's what God's love is

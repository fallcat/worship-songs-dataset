Almighty God, The Great I Am, 
 Immovable Rock, Omnipotent, Powerful, 
 Awesome Lord. 
 Victorious Warrior, Commanding King of Kings, 
 Mighty Conqueror and the only time, 
 The only time I ever saw him run, 
 Was when... 
 He ran to me, 
 He took me in His arms, 
 Held my head to His chest, 
 Said "My son's come home again!" 
 Lifted my face, 
 Wiped the tears from my eyes, 
 With forgiveness in His voice He said 
 "Son, do you know I still love You?" 
 (End Chorus) 
 He caught me By surprise, When God ran... 
 The day I left home, 
 I knew I'd broken His heart. 
 And I wondered then, if things could ever be the same. 
 Then one night, 
 I remembered His love for me. 
 And down that dusty road, ahead I could see, 
 It was the only time, 
 It was the only time I ever saw Him run. 
 And then... 
 He caught me by surprise. 
 And He brought me to my knees. 
 When God ran... I saw Him run to me. 
 I was so ashamed, all alone, and so far away. 
 But now I know, that He's been waiting for this day... 
 I saw Him run to me, 
 He took me in His arms, 
 Held my head to his chest, 
 Said "My son's come home again!" 
 Lifted my face, 
 Wiped the tears from my eyes, 
 With forgiveness in His voice 
 I felt his love for me again. 
 He ran to me, 
 He took me in His arms, 
 Held my head to his chest, 
 Said "My son's come home again!" 
 Lifted my face, 
 Wiped the tears from my eyes, 
 With forgiveness in His voice 
 He said "Son" 
 He called me Son. 
 He said "Son, do you know I still love You?" 
 He ran to me (When God Ran) 
 (I saw Him run to me) 
 And then I ran to Him 
 (When God ran) 
 When God ran

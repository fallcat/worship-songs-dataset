You're standing there with your list of regrets 
 That you can't get past yourself 
 You wish so bad that you could make the mark 
 But your dreams are stuck on a shelf 
 And all you wanna do is turn back time 
 And redeem the days you lost 
 But shame keeps calling out your name 
 The chains refuse to fall 
 It's not over, it's not over 
 This is the moment grace walks in 
 With arms wide open, arms wide open 
 To tell you this is not the end 
 When doubt is strong and your will 
 Is weak to even believe again 
 That's when grace 
 That's when grace walks in 
 You once believed that you could change the world 
 With a fire deep in your soul 
 Your faith was strong and the call was clear 
 You were sure you could make a new road 
 Like so many the flame grew dark 
 Your confidence hit the wall 
 There always seems to be a lot o' big questions 
 But the answers seem so small 
 It's not over, it's not over 
 This is the moment grace walks in 
 With arms wide open, arms wide open 
 To tell you this is not the end 
 When doubt is strong and your will 
 Is weak to even believe again 
 That's when grace 
 That's when grace walks in 
 Just in the nick of time 
 Right there to save our lives 
 Grace is greater, grace is greater 
 It's not over, it's not over 
 This is the moment grace walks in 
 It's not over, it's not over 
 This is the moment grace walks in 
 With arms wide open, arms wide open 
 To tell you this is not the end 
 When doubt is strong and your will 
 Is weak to even believe again 
 That's when grace 
 That's when grace walks in 
 That's when grace walks in 
 That's when grace 
 That's when grace walks in 
 That's when grace 
 That's when grace walks in

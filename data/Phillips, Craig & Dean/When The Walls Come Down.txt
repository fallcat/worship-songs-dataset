Moonlight shinin' through venetian blinds 
 Shadows dancin' on the ceiling 
 This is one of my favorite times 
 Your words of peace are so healing 
 Hold me now in Your arms of safety 
 Hold me now, Lord, I need Your mercy 
 When the walls come down 
 When I let my defenses fall 
 Like rain to the ground 
 When the walls come down 
 Your love lifts me up 
 When the walls come down 
 It ain't easy to admit the truth 
 When it comes to a weakness 
 Though I know I can't hide from You 
 Still I run from forgiveness 
 Here and now, I surrender, Jesus 
 Here and now, I find all that I needed 
 When the walls come down 
 When I let my defenses fall 
 Like rain to the ground 
 When the walls come down 
 Your love lifts me up 
 When the walls come down 
 You see it all 
 'Cause You see through walls to my weakness 
 I'm not afraid 
 'Cause I know I'm safe in Your arms 
 You meet me there 
 When the walls come down 
 When I let my defenses fall 
 Like rain to the ground 
 When the walls come down 
 Your love lifts me up 
 When the walls come down

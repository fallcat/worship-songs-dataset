There is a battle in the heartland 
 Where my faith and real life meet 
 Sometimes hope seems out of reach 
 I hear the growing cry for freedom 
 Am I equal to the call 
 Where's the love that conquers all 
 It's so easy to be human 
 So human to give in 
 But when I reach beyond my weakness 
 I'm reminded once again 
 The power is still where it's always been 
 His Word is alive 
 Jesus still lives 
 The power of His blood hasn't lessened or dimmed 
 It's where it's always been 
 It's where it's always been 
 Where's the passion for the mission 
 Where's the fervour of our faith 
 Where's the evidence of Grace 
 Where's the love that finds compassion 
 In the sea of human need 
 Where's the truth that sets man free 
 In a world that holds no answers 
 Every heart will someday find 
 That everything they long for has been there all the time 
 There's a cross that I can hold to 
 There's a reason to believe 
 There's an empty grave that's calling out to me

Philippians 3:12 
 Here I sit with this cup of life in front of me 
 I see it's full but I'm afraid to drink 
 Because I've tried and I've missed the mark 
 So many times 
 I can't forget all the hurt inside 
 But rising up from the ashes 
 Of these memories 
 I reach for a hand to save me 
 And I hear Him Calling 
 Walk on 
 Till fear turns to faith and faith becomes sight 
 Where strength begins 
 You've got to press on 
 Move on through the pain 
 Move on to the place 
 Where weakness ends 
 Where strength begins 
 Here I stand looking to the climb 
 That's up ahead 
 I will fall but I'll get up again 
 Because I know if I keep on walking 
 Through the fire 
 I'll be a newer, stronger man of God and I'll 
 Rise up from the ashes of my memories 
 And I'll reach for His hand to save me 
 And I'll hear Him calling 
 Take up your cross 
 Get up and walk 
 Where strength begins 
 Rising up from the ashes of these memories 
 I reach for his hand to save me 
 And I hear Him calling

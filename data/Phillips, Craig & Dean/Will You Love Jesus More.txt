I feel quite sure if I did my best 
 I could maybe impress you 
 With tender words and a harmony 
 A clever rhyme or two 
 But if all I've done in the time we've shared 
 Is turn your eyes on me 
 Then I've failed at what I've been called to do 
 There's someone else I want you to see 
 Will you love Jesus more 
 When we go our different ways 
 When this moment is a memory 
 Will you remember His face 
 Will you look back and realize 
 You sensed His love more than you did before 
 I'd pray for nothing less 
 Than for you to love Jesus more 
 I'd like to keep these memories 
 In frames of gold and silver 
 And reminisce a year from now 
 About the smiles we've shared 
 But above all else I hope you will come 
 To know the Father's love 
 When you see the Lord face to face 
 You'll hear Him say "well done" 
 Will you love Jesus more 
 When we go our different ways 
 When this moment is a memory 
 Will you remember His face 
 Will you look back and realize 
 You sensed His love more than you did before 
 I'd pray for nothing less 
 Than for you to love Jesus more 
 Will you love Jesus more 
 When we go our different ways 
 When this moment is a memory 
 Will you remember His face 
 Will you look back and realize 
 You sensed His love more than you did before 
 I'd pray for nothing less 
 Than for you to love Jesus more 
 I'd pray for nothing less 
 Than for you to love Jesus more

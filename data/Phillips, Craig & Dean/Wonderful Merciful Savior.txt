Wonderful, merciful Savior 
 Precious Redeemer and friend 
 Who would have thought that a lamb could 
 Rescue the souls of men 
 Oh, You rescue the souls of men 
 Counselor, Comforter, Keeper 
 Spirit we long to embrace 
 You offer hope when our hearts have 
 Hopelessly lost the way 
 Oh, we hopelessly lost the way 
 You are the one that we praise 
 You are the one we adore 
 You give the healing and grace 
 Our hearts always hunger for 
 Oh, our hearts always hunger for 
 Almighty, infinite Father 
 Faithfully loving Your own 
 Here in our weakness You find us 
 Falling before Your throne 
 Oh, we're falling before Your throne 
 You are the one that we praise 
 You are the one we adore 
 You give the healing and grace 
 Our hearts always hunger for 
 Oh, our hearts always hunger for

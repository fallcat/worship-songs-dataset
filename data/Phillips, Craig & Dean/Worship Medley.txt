Bow down before the Lord 
 Worship Him, oh worship Him 
 Bow down before our God 
 Enter in, oh enter in 
 Consuming fire and sweet perfume 
 His awesome presence fills this room 
 This is holy ground, so come and bow down 
 (Repeat) 
 Every knee shall bow before his throne 
 Every knee shall bow before his throne 
 The One who was and is to come 
 The Lamb of God, the Holy One 
 Glorify, glorify the Lord 
 Glorify, glorify the Lord 
 Every knee shall bow before his throne (every knee shall bow down) 
 Every knee shall bow before his throne 
 The One who was and is to come 
 The Lamb of God, the Holy One 
 Glorify, glorify the Lord 
 Glorify, glorify the Lord 
 All the earth bows down 
 All the earth sings praise to you 
 All the earth bows down, and sings praise to your name 
 Praise to your name Lord 
 Praise to your name Lord 
 All the earth bows down and sings praise to your name 
 (Repeat) x2

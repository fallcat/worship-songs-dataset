You don't have the right to remain silent 
 If you've been arrested by God's grace 
 You've gotta take the stand, to tell the story 
 Of how your guilty stains have been replaced 
 Oh, everything you've done has been erased 
 By the evidence of love 
 So, you don't have the right, no, you don't have the right 
 Have you ever felt yourself apprehended 
 Caught in your complacency 
 The struggle to remain undercover 
 Hear the witness you were meant to be 
 When you know so many others around you 
 Need what you have to say 
 You don't have the right to remain silent 
 If you've been arrested by God's grace 
 You've gotta take the stand, to tell the story 
 Of how your guilty stains have been replaced 
 Oh, everything you've done has been erased 
 By the evidence of love 
 So, you don't have the right, no, you don't have the right 
 Can you make it your determination 
 The people wait to hear your plea 
 The word you speak could be vital 
 To somebody's eternity 
 When so much hangs on the part that you play 
 How could you not speak up 
 You don't have the right to remain silent 
 If you've been arrested by God's grace 
 You've gotta take the stand, to tell the story 
 Of how your guilty stains have been replaced 
 Oh, everything you've done has been erased 
 By the evidence of love 
 When you're called to tell what you know 
 (Walk the talk and talk the walk) 
 C'mon and let the redeemed of the Lord say so 
 Let 'em say so 
 (Say so, say so, say so) 
 You don't have the right to remain silent 
 If you've been arrested by God's grace 
 You've gotta take the stand, to tell the story 
 Of how your guilty stains have been replaced 
 Everything you've done has been erased 
 By the evidence of love 
 You don't have the right to remain silent 
 If you've been arrested by God's grace 
 You've gotta take the stand, to tell the story 
 Of how your guilty stains have been replaced 
 Everything you've done has been erased 
 By the evidence of love 
 So, you don't have the right, no, you don't have the right 
 You don't have the right to remain silent 
 If you've been arrested by God's grace 
 You've gotta take the stand, to tell the story 
 Of how your guilty stains have been replaced 
 Everything you've done has been erased 
 By the evidence of love 
 So, you don't have the right, no, you don't have the right 
 You don't have the right to remain silent 
 If you've been arrested by God's grace 
 You've gotta take the stand, to tell the story 
 Of how your guilty stains have been replaced 
 Everything you've done has been erased 
 By the evidence of love 
 So, you don't have the right, no, you don't have the right

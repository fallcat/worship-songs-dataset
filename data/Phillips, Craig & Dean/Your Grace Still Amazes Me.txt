My faithful Father, enduring Friend 
 Your tender mercy's like a river with no end 
 It overwhelms me, covers my sin 
 Each time I come into Your presence 
 I stand in wonder once again 
 Your grace still amazes me 
 Your love is still a mystery 
 Each day I fall on my knees 
 Your grace still amazes me 
 'Cause Your grace still amazes me 
 Oh, patient Saviour, You make me whole 
 You are the Author and the Healer of my soul 
 What can I give You, Lord, what can I say 
 I know there's no way to repay You 
 Only to offer You my praise 
 It's deeper, it's wider 
 It's stronger, it's higher 
 It's deeper it's wider 
 It's stronger, it's higher than anything my eyes can see

Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 We cry holy and join with heaven 
 Around the throne we sing 
 Oh we sing holy 
 Holy is the Lord (Holy) 
 Holy is the Lord (Holy) 
 We sing 
 Holy is the lord (Holy) 
 Join with heaven 
 Holy is the lord (Holy) 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Great and mighty 
 God forever 
 King above Kings 
 We surrender to your majesty 
 'Cause all we can do is surrender 
 With hands raise and hearts obey 
 We surrender to your majesty 
 'Cause you are you are Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Glory to God forever 
 I'll praise you now and ever 
 Your love floods my thirsty soul 
 All majesty and power 
 Are yours Almighty Father 
 Great is your Holy name

There is a love I know 
 That never will let me go 
 Oh, it has captured me 
 Yet I am free 
 Even in times of pain 
 I know this love remains 
 Oh, it will comfort me 
 And make me see 
 That You are with me 
 You are with me here 
 I open my heart 
 And I let You in 
 Pour out Your love 
 Come and move again 
 I'm reaching out 
 For a touch from You 
 'Cause Jesus You can change me 
 And make me new today 
 Here in this precious love 
 The place where my heart belongs 
 I'm never letting go 
 I'm leaning in 
 For You are with me 
 You are with me here 
 I open my heart 
 And I let You in 
 Pour out Your love 
 Come and move again 
 I'm reaching out 
 For a touch from You 
 'Cause Jesus You can change me 
 And make me new today 
 I'm drawing closer 
 I'm drawing closer 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before 
 So I will reach out 
 And I will worship 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before 
 I'm drawing closer 
 I'm drawing closer 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before 
 So I will reach out 
 And I will worship 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before 
 I'm drawing closer 
 I'm drawing closer 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before 
 So I will reach out 
 And I will worship 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before 
 I open my heart 
 And I let You in 
 Pour out Your love 
 Come and move again 
 I'm reaching out 
 For a touch from You 
 'Cause Jesus You can change me 
 And make me new 
 I'm drawing closer 
 I'm drawing closer 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before 
 So I will reach out 
 And I will worship 
 You're taking me deeper 
 Than ever before

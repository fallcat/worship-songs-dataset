How great is Your love for me 
 That You gave up Your son for me 
 Now I am alive and free 
 Father I love You 
 Father I love You 
 Your love made a way for me 
 Into me You see 
 You love every part of me 
 Father You love me 
 Father You love me 
 Oh, the love of my Father 
 Is deeper than any love I know 
 Oh, the grace that He shows me 
 His love overwhelming 
 This I know 
 The love of my Father 
 The love of my Father 
 The love of my Father 
 The love of my Father 
 Abba Father 
 Your love is never-ending 
 There's no other love like Yours 
 In Your presence 
 My heart is overflowing 
 Father I am Yours

I can see it clearly now 
 There's a reason for this sound 
 It's Jesus 
 At the core of who I am 
 Is the risen Son Of Man 
 It's Jesus 
 You're like no other 
 For Your love is greater 
 And You are the center of it all 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 I exist to bring You praise 
 And to shout no other name 
 But Jesus 
 You're like no other 
 For Your love is greater 
 And You are the center of it all 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 You are the first, You are the last 
 You are my future, 'cause You took my past 
 You are the reason why I sing 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You 
 I'm living for You 
 It's all about You 
 It's all about You

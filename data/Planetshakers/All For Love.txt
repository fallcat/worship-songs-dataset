All for love our Saviour came 
 Gave his life and took my place 
 And now I live for You 
 And all we do will bring you praise 
 We'll bring you praise 
 Whoa oh oh 
 I'm living for Your glory 
 Whoa oh oh 
 'Cause You died to set me free 
 And the love that you gave when You took my place 
 For all the world to see 
 You gave everything 
 You gave everything 
 And it was all for love

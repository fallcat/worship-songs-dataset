He is risen from the grave 
 Undefeated, Jesus reigns 
 With all power in His name 
 He is over all, He is over all 
 At the mention of His name 
 Captivated, all proclaim 
 There's no limit to His reign 
 He is over all, He is over all 
 Christ supreme the nations bow 
 Our hearts adore as we cry out 
 Hosanna in the highest 
 Jesus is the greatest 
 Veiled in glory, robed in light 
 All surpassing is His might 
 Christ our Savior, lifted high 
 He is over all, He is over all 
 Christ supreme the nations bow 
 Our hearts adore as we cry out 
 Hosanna in the highest 
 Over all Your kingdom reigns 
 The earth resounds with Jesus praise 
 Hosanna in the highest

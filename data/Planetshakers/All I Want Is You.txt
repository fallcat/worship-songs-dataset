I waited all my life to be here face-to-face 
 I never knew that I could feel this kind of grace 
 The way You show me that Your love has washed me clean 
 Could never be erased it lives inside of me 
 Take me to that secret place 
 Where I can only see Your Face 
 And nothing else will ever feel this way 
 You take away my guilty stains 
 The things I've done that I can't change 
 It's only by the power of Your name 
 I stand here in this place 
 See the glory on Your face 
 Taken by the wonder of Your name 
 I'm desperate for Your touch 
 Never needed it so much 
 'Cause all I want is You 
 When all the things around me have fallen to the ground 
 I'm always thankful for the love in You I've found

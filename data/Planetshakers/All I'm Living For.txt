Here I am waiting for You, 
 Here I am reaching out to You, 
 I will run into Your arms again, 
 And I'm longing for Your touch 
 Once again 
 Take my life, everything, All I am, 
 An offering for You, 
 Cause You're all I'm living for 
 Here I am waiting on You, 
 Here I am reaching out for You, 
 I will run into Your arms again, 
 And I'm longing for your touch 
 Once again 
 Take my life, everything, All I am, 
 An offering for you, 
 Cause You're all I'm living for 
 Take my heart, all of me, 
 I'm laying down, to worship you my God 
 Cause You're all I'm living for 
 I will run into Your open arms, 
 To your love, that washes away my fears 
 I am found, deep in this mystery, 
 Cause You're all I'm living for 
 Cause You're all 
 You're all I'm living for 
 Jesus You're all 
 All I'm living for

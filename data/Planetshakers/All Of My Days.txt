Holy is the Lord 
 Every knee will bow at Your name 
 Clothed in majesty 
 I will sing Your praises forever 
 The oceans will roar 
 The mountains will tremble at 
 The sound of Your Name 
 The heavens will sing to You 
 With all I am 
 I will worship You 
 For all of my days I will lift Your Name on high 
 Glory to Your Name 
 Let the nations sing of Your Love 
 King of all the earth 
 I will sing Your praises forever 
 Holy, You are Holy Lord 
 Holy, You are Holy Lord

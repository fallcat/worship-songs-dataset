Here's my life 
 I bring every single piece 
 All as an offering 
 Let Your fire rest on me 
 I won't hold myself back from You 
 No, I won't hold myself back 
 I lay it all, all on the altar 
 For You are all, all I desire 
 All-consuming flame 
 Burn in me again 
 Lord have Your way 
 Have Your way 
 You won't relent 
 Till You reach the depths of me 
 My heart is opening 
 I am Yours and Yours to keep 
 I won't hold myself back from You 
 No, I won't hold myself back 
 I won't hold myself back from You 
 No, I won't hold myself back 
 I lay it all, all on the altar 
 For You are all, all I desire 
 All-consuming flame 
 Burn in me again 
 Lord have Your way 
 Have Your way 
 I lay it all, all on the altar 
 For You are all, all I desire 
 All-consuming flame 
 Burn in me again 
 Lord have Your way 
 Have Your way 
 Spirit fan into flame 
 This passion in my heart 
 All I am is Yours 
 All I am is Yours 
 Spirit breathe deep within me 
 Everything You are 
 All I am is Yours 
 All I am is Yours 
 Spirit fan into flame 
 This passion in my heart 
 All I am is Yours 
 All I am is Yours 
 Spirit breathe deep within me 
 Everything You are 
 All I am is Yours 
 All I am is Yours 
 Spirit fan into flame 
 This passion in my heart 
 All I am is Yours 
 All I am is Yours 
 Spirit breathe deep within me 
 Everything You are 
 All I am is Yours 
 All I am is Yours 
 I lay it all, all on the altar 
 For You are all, all I desire 
 All-consuming flame 
 Burn in me again 
 Lord have Your way 
 Have Your way 
 I lay it all, all on the altar 
 For You are all, all I desire 
 All-consuming flame 
 Burn in me again 
 Lord have Your way

My soul sings 
 To my Saviour King of Kings 
 Oh I need You 
 You are everything 
 To me 
 I love You 
 So much more than anything 
 I live for You 
 Jesus You are everything 
 You're all that I want 
 You're all that I need 
 You're all that I want 
 You're all that I live for in this world 
 In this world 
 Jesus 
 You are all I need 
 Jesus 
 You are everything

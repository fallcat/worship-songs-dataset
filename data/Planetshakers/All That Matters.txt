I'm alive for Your glory. 
 I'm alive to tell Your story. 
 Of all You are. 
 Let Your Kingdom come now. 
 Let Your will be done in my life. 
 Have Your way. 
 I live all for Your glory. 
 Your love and Your mercy. 
 I'm living for Your Name. 
 My whole life I'm living for You God. 
 My one love, You are the only one I see. 
 I'm living for You, only for Your Name. 
 I'm living for You and the glory. 
 The glory of Your Name. 
 Jesus all that matters. 
 Is the glory of Your Name.

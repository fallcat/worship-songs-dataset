You turned my darkness into light, 
 You set me free from all that weighed me down 
 You brought me out of sin and shame, 
 You gave Your life, I'll never be the same 
 Oh the joy You have given to me, 
 Oh the peace You have given to me, 
 Oh the love You have given to me, 
 It makes me wanna sing forever! 
 All the praise, goes to You, 
 Lord forever we will sing 
 All the love, goes to You, 
 We will praise You! 
 You alone, are the one, 
 Who has saved and set us free 
 All for you, we will live, 
 We will praise You! 
 Here we go, we're letting go 
 Come and take control, 
 Cause You are God, 
 And we know, 
 That You hold our world

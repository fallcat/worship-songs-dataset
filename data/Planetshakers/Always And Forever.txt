There's nothing better 
 Than living for You 
 Saving my world with You 
 There's nothing better 
 Than praising Your name 
 And lifting my praise 
 Wanna spend forever 
 Standing in Your presence 
 And I wanna show You 
 What You mean to me God 
 I give You my whole life 
 And I gotta tell You 
 That I am Yours forever 
 Lord I give You my whole life 
 Jesus I will live for You 
 In everything I do 
 I'm holding onto You 
 Always! 
 Always and forever... 
 And when my world is falling down 
 In You I will be found 
 I'm staying in Your arms today 
 Always! Always and forever... 
 There's nothing better 
 Than living for You 
 Saving my world with You 
 There's nothing better... 
 And I wanna show You 
 What You mean to me God 
 I give You my whole life 
 And I've gotta tell You 
 I am Yours forever 
 Lord I give You my whole life 
 Jesus I will live for You 
 In everything I do 
 I'm holding onto You 
 Always! 
 Always and forever... 
 And when my world is falling down 
 In You I will be found 
 I'm staying in Your arms today 
 Always! 
 Always and forever... 
 Always and forever 
 Always! Always and forever (repeat) 
 Jesus I will live for You 
 In everything I do 
 I'm holding onto You 
 Always! 
 Always and forever... 
 And when my world is falling down 
 In You I will be found 
 I'm staying in Your arms today 
 Always! 
 Always and forever... 
 Always 
 Always and forever 
 Always 
 Always and forever 
 Always 
 Always and forever

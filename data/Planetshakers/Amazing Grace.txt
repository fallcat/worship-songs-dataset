Amazing grace that touched my heart 
 Anointing me to worship 
 Amazing grace that causes me 
 To stand in awe and sing 
 I reach out to You 
 Your hand of love, it conquers me 
 Calling to You 
 To the glory of Your name 
 I am falling for You 
 Run into Your presence 
 Falling into the arms of grace 
 I will call up on heaven 
 Just to see Your face 
 I'm lost in Your love

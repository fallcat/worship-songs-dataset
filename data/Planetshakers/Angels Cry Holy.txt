Before all time began 
 You had the perfect plan 
 To make us 
 In the image of Yourself 
 Although we went astray 
 You even planned that day 
 On which You sent Your Son 
 To pay the price 
 You took on all the sins of the world 
 And washed them all away 
 Bearing every curse upon that tree 
 With all my future plans 
 They're safe within Your hands 
 Far beyond my 
 Highest thoughts and prayers 
 With all my heart and soul 
 I'll praise You and extol 
 The mighty God 
 Who holds me in His arms 
 We all cry holy, holy 
 Holy is the Lord 
 The angels cry holy, holy 
 Holy is the Lord

Now is the time to make a stand 
 To rise up and take the promised land 
 To walk in the favour of our God 
 Lift up your eyes to see the King 
 Upon you His glory will be seen 
 Cause His light is rising up on you 
 Arise, shine 
 For the glory of the Lord is upon You 
 Arise, shine 
 Shine His light 
 I can feel something in the air 
 The Spirit of God is surely here 
 As the church rises up to Him 
 The nations they come to sing His praise 
 The lost are found running to His grace 
 Cause His light is shining up on you 
 Arise, arise, arise, arise 
 Church arise, arise, arise, arise 
 Church arise, arise, arise, arise 
 Church arise, arise, arise, arise

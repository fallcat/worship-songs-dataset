Be my vision 
 When the waves are closing in 
 Keep my focus 
 On the peace You breathe within 
 And my heart will fear no more 
 As I turn to face You Lord 
 Take this life, let glory and majesty flood my eyes 
 Lord overwhelm me till all that I want 
 And all that I see is You 
 Till all that I see is You 
 Be my vision when I reach life's greatest day 
 Give me wisdom that I would humble myself and pray 
 Teach my heart to lean on You 
 Lord in everything I do 
 Take this life, let glory and majesty flood my eyes 
 Lord overwhelm me till all that I want 
 And all that I see is You 
 Step by step, Jesus I'll follow You 
 Breath by breath, Lord I will worship You 
 Burn in my heart till all that I see is You 
 Take this life, let glory and majesty flood my eyes 
 Lord overwhelm me till all that I want 
 And all that I see is You 
 Step by step, Jesus I'll follow You 
 Breath by breath, Lord I will worship You 
 Burn in my heart till all that I see is You 
 Till all that I see is You 
 Till all that I see is You 
 Till all that I see is You 
 Jesus 
 Till all that I see is You 
 Till all that I see is You 
 Till all that I see is You

 Jesus be all I see 
 Jesus in everything 
 I can see You now 
 I can see You now 
 Lord You are here with me 
 You're present in everything 
 So I lift my voice 
 I have resolved to serve You Lord

Nothing else can make me feel this way 
 Like your presence in my life, everyday 
 How can I explain the way you make me feel 
 'Cause Jesus your love for me is so unreal 
 (Repeat x 1) 
 I wanna be where you are 
 I wanna stand at your feet 
 Jesus to be where you are 
 It makes me wanna sing 
 Ill praise you everysingle day 
 I can't stop lovin' you always 
 Jesus to be where you are, it makes me wana sing ur praise 
 I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you 
 I wanna be with you every single day 
 (Repeat x1)

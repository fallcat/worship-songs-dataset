The rain may fall, 
 The thunder roar, 
 Yet I believe, I believe 
 What people may say, 
 Whatever comes my way, 
 I will believe, I believe 
 Nothing can separate me from Your love, 
 So I lift my eyes to heaven and believe 
 You are my God, 
 You are my saviour, 
 You hold the world within Your hands 
 You are my God, 
 You are my healer, 
 Lord I believe in You, Jesus, 
 Lord I believe 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
 Hallelujah, Glory to God

My God is big 
 So strong so mighty 
 My God's plan for me 
 Goes beyond my wildest dreams 
 My God is good 
 He's so good to me 
 My God is big 
 So strong so mighty 
 My God is good 
 He's so good to me 
 He's my God and 
 He is my refuge 
 He's the rock on which I stand 
 He's my fortress 
 God, He is my life 
 He holds the oceans in His hand 
 My God is Big 
 So Strong so mighty 
 My God is good 
 He's so good to me 
 There's nothing my God cannot do

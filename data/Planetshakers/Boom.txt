I am ready more than ever 
 For you to move 
 My heart is open and I surrender 
 Every part of me 
 Boom 
 It's an explosion 
 God is here to move 
 Come and take over 
 'Cause I am here for you 
 My hope is in you 
 Every day I'm living for you 
 Give me your power 
 So I can change this world for you 
 Show me your ways Lord 
 Gonna run this race for you 
 Give me your spirit 
 Come and set my heart on fire 
 Your power, Your glory 
 Come and fill this place 
 Gonna lift my voice to You 
 Gonna give You all I am 
 Gonna live for You alone 
 'Cause You have set me free

From the moment that I wake up 
 Put on my make up 
 You are right there with me 
 Doesn't matter what I go through 
 You're my breakthrough 
 You know everything about me 
 You heard every prayer that came from my heart 
 And You love me 
 Yes You love me 
 When I think of how You made me 
 It's amazing, I reflect Your beauty 
 Every moment that I'm living 
 No counting Your thoughts towards me 
 Your grace woven through every part 
 And You love me 
 You love me 
 I was made for worship and praise 
 To be lost in Your embrace 
 I was made to love You always 
 I'm born to praise 
 Yeah 
 The praise goes up, His presence comes down 
 Lift my voice to the Lord, when there's trouble all around 
 I was born to praise, living in His glory 
 Now I'm feeling the sun rays, walking on cloud nine 
 Life on the incline, living in God's dream, victory now mine (woo) 
 Shout it hallelujah, praise Jehovah, shout it out 
 I was made to worship Him 
 I was born to praise the king 
 Lift my hands and worship Him 
 Hey 
 There's nothing like Him, nothing like Him 
 We were made to worship Him 
 We were born to praise the king 
 Hey hey 
 Give Him all the praise 
 I was made for worship and praise 
 To be lost in Your embrace 
 I was made to love You always 
 I'm born to praise 
 I was made for worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I was made for worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I was made for worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I was made for worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I was made for worship and praise 
 To be lost in Your embrace 
 I was made to love You always 
 I'm born to praise 
 I was made for worship and praise 
 To be lost in Your embrace 
 I was made to love You always 
 I'm born to praise 
 Born to praise 
 Born to praise 
 Born to praise

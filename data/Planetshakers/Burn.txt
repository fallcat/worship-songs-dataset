Here in this place 
 I can feel Your touch 
 As I seek Your face 
 Showing me Your love 
 I need Your now 
 Come and wash me over 
 Your Spirit breathes 
 Filling me with power 
 Open up my heart 
 And You will find 
 This fire burns so deep 
 It burns so bright for You 
 Lord, I will burn 
 Lord, I will burn for You

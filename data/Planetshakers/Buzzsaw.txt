Gonna cut through the dark like a buzzsaw 
 Seen a light gonna live by a new law 
 Got a gift of grace 
 From the Ancient of Days 
 Gonna cut through the dark like a buzzsaw 
 Law of love, gift of faith and a hope sure 
 Now I fight the one 
 Who opposes God's Son 
 You come against me with 
 A sword, a lying myth 
 I come to you in the Name of the Lord 
 For He's the Lord of Hosts 
 The God of Israel 
 And it is Him who you have defiled 
 Darkness flee 
 I'm a child born of the Cross 
 The warrior in me 
 Fights to save what which was lost 
 Demons flee 
 At the sound of His Holy Name 
 Set the captives free 
 Like a buzzsaw through a wall of flame

When the darkness closes in 
 And I'm on my knees again 
 I call Your name 
 I call Your name 
 Cause it is the sweetest name I know 
 Jesus, oh my Jesus 
 When my soul begins to soar 
 And my heart it longs for more 
 I call Your name 
 I call Your name 
 Cause it is the sweetest name I know 
 I call Your name 
 I call Your name 
 I call on Your name 
 I call on Your name 
 I call on Your name 
 Jesus

I will lift my eyes to You 
 Where my help comes from 
 Lord I find my rest in You 
 Keeper of my soul 
 You gave it all for me 
 Maker of Heaven 
 You paid the price 
 So I could be with You 
 Jesus, I remember the cross 
 Where You hung upon that tree 
 You won the ultimate victory 
 Jesus, I remember Calvary 
 You reign 
 You reign over the earth

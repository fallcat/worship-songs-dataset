All of my life I've searched for this 
 Its hard to explain this happiness 
 All of my searching left me poor 
 Now I have tasted, my spirits crying 
 Out for more 
 Everyday its hard to believe 
 The way You change what's inside of me 
 I wanna get closer to You 
 When I think that I've let You down 
 Your open arms of love I have found 
 I wanna get closer to You 
 There was a time when I was lost 
 Caught in a world of selfish cares 
 But when You found me something changed 
 My eyes were opened, now I will never 
 Be the same

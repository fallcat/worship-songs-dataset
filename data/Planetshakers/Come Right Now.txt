Nothing excites us 
 Like Jesus 
 'Cause in His presence 
 There's freedom 
 All of our sin 
 Is forgiven 
 So we give to Him 
 The highest praise 
 It's the greatest feeling 
 When You fill this place 
 In this moment 
 You are moving 
 As we give You praise 
 Come right now 
 Holy Spirit 
 Release Your power 
 Lord we are hungry 
 For more of You 
 Heaven's open 
 You're bursting through 
 Filling this place 
 Like a rushing wind 
 Come and move again 
 Like a fire within 
 We will burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 We will burn 
 To everybody 
 That's hurting 
 Here comes the sound 
 Of rejoicing 
 Our happiness 
 He's restoring 
 So we give to Him 
 The highest praise 
 It's the greatest feeling 
 When You fill this place 
 In this moment 
 You are moving 
 As we give You praise 
 Come right now 
 Holy Spirit 
 Release Your power 
 Lord we are hungry 
 For more of You 
 Heaven's open 
 You're bursting through 
 Filling this place 
 Like a rushing wind 
 Come and move again 
 Like a fire within 
 We will burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 We will burn 
 We raise our hands up 
 We're going all out 
 We're lifting up the name of Jesus 
 Nothing will stop us 
 Singing Your praises 
 Your Holy Spirit is here 
 Like a rushing wind 
 Come and move again 
 Like a fire within 
 We will burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 Burn, burn 
 We raise our hands up 
 We raise our hands up 
 We raise our hands up 
 We raise our hands up

Nothing can separate us from this love 
 No sin no any other thing 
 You were called for such a time as this 
 So turn to God don't turn away 
 There's a voice its calling out to you 
 So open up your ears and hear 
 There's a destiny that waits for you 
 So now's the time to make a way 
 Just run into His arms 
 No matter what you've done 
 Just look into His eyes 
 And see the loving grace of God 
 Come to Jesus 
 He is everything you need 
 Just turn to Jesus 
 He is everything you seek 
 Just come to Jesus 
 He is everything you need 
 More than the air you breathe today 
 I will run into Your arms x 4

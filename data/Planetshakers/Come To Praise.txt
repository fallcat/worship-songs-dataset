When I think of the way that He gave all for me 
 I just can't stop singing this song that I sing 
 He is so unbelivable take it from me 
 His love is irreplaceable it's all that I need 
 For everything He's done in me 
 All I wanna do is just praise Him 
 Everybody! 
 I don't know what You've come to do 
 I've come to praise Him (praise Him, praise Him, praise Him) 
 It's just plain to see 
 That when I'm praising Him 
 I can't contain it 
 I can't hold it in 
 So who's got the praise? 
 We got the praise! 
 Who you giving your praise to? 
 Jesus! 
 Praise Him 
 Come on and praise Him 
 I don't know what You've come to do 
 I've come to praise Him

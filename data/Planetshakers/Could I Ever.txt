When I woke up today 
 Thought of all the things You've done 
 Found myself here 
 Feeling all so overcome 
 You gave Your life away for me 
 Truly my heart belongs to You 
 So let me say 
 Could I ever thank You for 
 What You did at Calvary 
 When You bled and died for me 
 Could I ever turn away 
 Knowing that You paid the price 
 That I could never pay 
 When I think of the way 
 That You died upon that Cross 
 Bearing my sin 
 Even though my heart was lost

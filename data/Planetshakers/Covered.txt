Grace, glorious grace, grace, glorious grace 
 At the cross you called it finished 
 Grace, wonderful grace, grace, wonderful grace 
 At the cross all of my sin is 
 Covered, covered, covered by your grace, oh 
 Covered, covered, covered by your grace, oh 
 Grace, beautiful grace, grace, beautiful grace 
 At the cross love everlasting 
 Grace, powerful grace, grace, powerful grace 
 At the cross all of my past is 
 Covered, covered, covered by your grace, oh 
 Covered, covered, covered by your grace, oh 
 No matter what I've done, no matter where I've been 
 No matter how I fall, You pick me up again 
 You have removed my shame, You take as I am 
 You call me justified, now I am covered by Your grace 
 Covered, covered, covered by your grace, oh 
 Covered, covered, covered by your grace

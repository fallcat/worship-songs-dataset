A wondrous mystery in the pages of history 
 Of a Man who bled and died for me 
 He's more than a story 
 He's the One who hung upon a tree 
 His crimson flow poured out for me 
 He gave His life to set me free 
 And I fall down 
 I fall down 
 I fall down on my knees 
 And cry Holy is the Lord 
 Worship Him 
 Worship Him and adore

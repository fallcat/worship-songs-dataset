I'm not holding back 
 I've got to give You praise 
 With every part of me I'm breakin' out 
 I've got to let You know 
 That You're my everything 
 With every part of me I'll praise you now 
 And I will dance and sing 
 You know I'm gonna shout it out 
 For You my King 
 'Cause You are all I need now 
 It's time to get up and dance 
 'Cause we're free now 
 It's time to lift up your praise 
 And shout it out now 
 It's time to break off the chains 
 'Cause it's a brand new day 
 And everything is ok 
 Let's dance! 
 Dance now 
 Everybody shout now 
 Liftin' up our praise loud 
 Dancing in this freedom we know

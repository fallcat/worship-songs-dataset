I'm alive 'cause Jesus gave me life 
 He opened up my eyes 
 And I can see clearly now 
 Oh, everybody dance now, oh 
 Everybody give it up for Jesus 
 Give Him glory for He has redeemed us 
 Everybody give it up for Jesus 
 Praise His name 
 My desire is to lift You higher 
 It's only burning brighter 
 This passion inside of me 
 Oh, everybody dance now, oh 
 This praise is bursting out 
 I can't contain it now 
 This praise is bursting out, out, out

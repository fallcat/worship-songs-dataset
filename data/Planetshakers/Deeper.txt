I want to know You, 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to feel You, 
 More than before 
 I want to touch You, 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want You Jesus, 
 More than before 
 More of You, Jesus I want more 
 More of You, My Lord 
 Take me deeper, Than I've been before 
 Take me further, God I long for more 
 Take me higher, Than I've been before 
 Jesus I want more, Jesus I need more 
 More of You, 
 More of You, Jesus 
 More of You, 
 I need more of You

All I want is to see your face 
 Shining down on me 
 All I want is to touch your heart 
 All I want is you 
 I am completely devoted to you 
 My heart is wholly consumed by your love 
 I lay down my whole life to bring you praise 
 I am wholly devoted to you 
 Treasure found in the secret place 
 Never ending joy 
 Healing flows from your throne of grace 
 Love restores my soul 
 Repeat chorus twice 
 Consume me, fill me 
 Saturate my soul 
 Consume me, fill me 
 Come and make me whole 
 Consume me, fill me 
 Saturate my soul 
 Jesus Christ - King on high 
 Repeat chorus 2 twice

You can do all things 
 Heal every sickness free every captive 
 You can do all things 
 Restore what is broken blind eyes 
 You open 
 The mountains melt like wax before 
 You God 
 So let all the earth rejoice in who 
 You are 
 Do it again do it again 
 Everything we've seen and more 
 Do it again do it again 
 Lord we believe for more 
 Do it again 
 Do it again do it again Jesus 
 Whoa

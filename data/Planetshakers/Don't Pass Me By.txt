My heart it longs 
 My soul it thirsts for more 
 For more of You 
 I'm reaching out 
 I'm waiting here for more 
 For more of You 
 Cause all I want is You 
 And all I need is to be here with You 
 I'm hungry for Your fire 
 I'm desperate, You're my one desire 
 Jesus, please don't pass me by 
 I need You more than ever 
 I'm thirsty for a touch from Heaven 
 Jesus, please don't pass me by 
 Don't pass me by Lord 
 I'm desperate for You

Oh this is it 
 I leave it all behind 
 The past mistakes 
 I wished I could rewind 
 I am moving forward today 
 As Your grace lights up the way 
 You will never lead me astray 
 So I'll never run away 
 Now, I'm drawing closer 
 Now, I'm drawing closer 
 No matter where, no matter when 
 I am reaching out again 
 Now, I'm drawing closer 
 I'm drawing closer to You 
 Through the things 
 That I don't understand 
 Oh I will praise 
 To You I lift my hands 
 'Cause I am moving forward today 
 As Your grace lights up the way 
 You will never lead me astray 
 So I'll never run away 
 And now, I'm drawing closer 
 Now, I'm drawing closer 
 No matter where, no matter when 
 I am reaching out again, again 
 Now, I'm drawing closer 
 I'm drawing closer to You 
 And as I draw close to You 
 You draw close to me 
 All that I want is You 
 'Cause with You I am free 
 And now, I'm drawing closer 
 And now, I'm drawing closer 
 I'm drawing closer to You 
 Closer to You 
 In every season, I am drawing 
 Closer to You 
 In every season, I am drawing 
 Closer to You

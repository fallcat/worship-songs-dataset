There's a party right here 
 For Your glory is all around 
 In this electric atmosphere 
 Where Your praise is the greatest sound 
 Come on and lift Him up higher 
 For He is worthy, for He is worthy 
 Come on and sing it out louder 
 Give Him the glory, give Him the glory 
 You are, You are, the reason why we celebrate 
 You are, You are, worthy of the highest praise 
 You are 
 Freedom is here 
 And now's the time for letting go 
 In this electric atmosphere 
 Everybody let the good times roll 
 Come on and lift Him up higher 
 For He is worthy, for He is worthy 
 Come on and sing it out louder 
 Give Him the glory, give Him the glory 
 You are, You are, the reason why we celebrate 
 You are, You are, worthy of the highest praise 
 You are, You are, You are 
 (You are, You are, You are) 
 Everything is so much better 
 'Cause I know it's You and me together 
 And Your love is holding me forever 
 And I know that'll never change 
 You are, You are, the reason why we celebrate 
 You are, You are, worthy of the highest praise 
 You are, You are, the reason why we celebrate 
 You are, You are, worthy of the highest praise 
 You are

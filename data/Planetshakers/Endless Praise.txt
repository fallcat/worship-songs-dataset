You are God and we lift You up 
 We'll keep singing, we'll keep praising 
 We won't stop giving all we've got 
 'Cause You're worthy of all glory 
 Oh, there is no other 
 You are forever Lord over all 
 There's nobody like You 
 No one beside You 
 To You let endless praise resound 
 Every night and day 
 And with no delay 
 Let endless praise resound 
 Boundless love, light before the sun 
 Your glory eternal 
 Never stops giving all You've got 
 Creation keeps singing 
 We lift You up, up, up 
 We're giving You our love, love, love 
 For everything You've done, done, done 
 We give You all the praise

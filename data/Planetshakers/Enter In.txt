You lead me through each day 
 Your love it covers me 
 And when I feel afraid 
 Your love it covers me 
 Restorer of my soul 
 Your love it covers me 
 Your presence makes me whole 
 Your love it covers me 
 You are the King of glory 
 You're the Lord 
 Strong and mighty 
 King of glory 
 Enter in 
 I lift my hands to heaven 
 Shout aloud 
 Sing Your praises 
 King of glory 
 Enter in 
 To You I lift my soul 
 My God I trust in You 
 Show me Your ways oh Lord 
 My God I trust in You 
 Let me not feel ashamed 
 My God I trust in You 
 I'll serve You all my days 
 My God I trust in You 
 King of glory 
 King of glory 
 King of glory

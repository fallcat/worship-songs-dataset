Now is the time for God's people to arise 
 The day is here Lord Your kingdom we will build 
 We are called for greater 
 We are called for more 
 Let Your love and power 
 Move through us 
 All we want is You Lord come and fill us 
 Hear the cry of our hearts come and pour it out 
 Pour it out on us 
 You alone are the One we desire 
 You alone are the One that we're living for 
 So pour it out on us 
 We believe for even greater 
 We believe for more 
 Let Your power come upon us 
 We believe for more

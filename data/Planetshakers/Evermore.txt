I will sing 
 Of the mercy of the Lord 
 And I will shout 
 Of Your faithfulness oh God 
 For there is none like You 
 Seated in Your majesty 
 Holy One I come 
 To worship You forevermore 
 You are my God my life my all 
 And I live for You alone 
 I am Yours evermore 
 Heaven and earth will shout Your praise 
 The wonder of Your name 
 I'll proclaim evermore 
 Evermore 
 Evermore 
 And I will run 
 Into Your presence 
 And I will sing 
 Sing forever

When I feel down I look to you 
 When I feel low your words ring true 
 It's not by might or in my strength 
 But its by your spirit moving in my life 
 'Cause God you are my life 
 I will praise you 
 You're everything to me 
 I'll live for you 
 You're the reason that I sing 
 I won't go back to the way it used to be 
 'Cause I've found you and your everything to me 
 At times when I look down and all I see is 
 Sinking sand 
 I'm thankful that it's you the solid rock on 
 Which I stand

You ask me why 
 Why I'm so different 
 Why I'm not the same as everybody else 
 Well something changed 
 It just happened 
 When I opened up my heart and let Him in 
 Jesus came in he came into my life 
 And I know I never felt so good. 
 CauseEverything's changed Everything is different 
 Everything's changed Everything is different 
 Everything's changed Everything is different 
 Everything's changed Everything is different 
 Now 
 You ask me how 
 How I can be sure 
 How I know it's not just something else for fun 
 Cause He's so real 
 So real in my life 
 He picked me up and turned my universe around 
 Everything, everything, everything in my life's changed 
 Everything, everything, everything in my life's different

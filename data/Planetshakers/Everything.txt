So what else can I say 
 But what You mean to me 
 You are my everything 
 And all I need to say 
 Is I will praise You now and always 
 I will lift Your Name on high 
 You have given me a new start 
 And I will live to praise Your Name 
 You are great and mighty 
 You are Prince of Peace 
 You are everything to me 
 You are my Redeemer 
 You are King of kings 
 You are everything to me 
 Holy, holy, holy 
 Lord God Almighty 
 Who was and is and is to come

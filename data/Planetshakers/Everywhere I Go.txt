(Everywhere that I go 
 I will let the whole world know) 
 I cannot contain what 
 You've done in me 
 I can't stop lifting up 
 My praises to You 
 My Jesus 
 Everywhere I go 
 I will shout Your praises 
 Everywhere I go 
 I just can't contain it 
 You healed me set me free 
 You gave me a dream 
 Now I shout all about 
 The King of all kings 
 My Jesus 
 Everywhere that I go 
 I'm gonna shout it 
 Everyday of my life 
 I'm gonna shout it

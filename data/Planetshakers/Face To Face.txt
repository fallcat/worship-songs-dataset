Here, now 
 This is the moment 
 Speak now 
 I'm out in the open 
 With emptied hands 
 I reach again 
 These walls are 
 Finally falling 
 The space 
 Between us is closing 
 My heart gives way 
 To perfect grace 
 I'm drawing closer 
 Than ever before 
 You've patiently waited 
 And now I am sure 
 Jesus 
 I lay my defenses down 
 'Cause I just want You now 
 My fears concede 
 To Your sureness 
 My shame melts 
 Away in Your brilliance 
 And now I see 
 You're all I need 
 I'm drawing closer 
 Than ever before 
 You've patiently waited 
 And now I am sure 
 Jesus 
 I lay my defenses down 
 'Cause I just want You now 
 Always faithful 
 You welcome me home 
 And my heart will 
 Praise You 
 My God, my reward 
 Jesus 
 I lay my defenses down 
 'Cause I just want You now 
 'Cause I just want You now 
 'Cause I just want You 
 You meet me 
 Face to face 
 You wrap me 
 In Your embrace 
 When You look 
 Me in the eye 
 I know 
 You just want me now 
 You just want me now 
 So I give You 
 The highest praise 
 And I'll worship 
 For all my days 
 When I look 
 You in the eye 
 I know 
 I just want You now 
 I just want You now 
 You meet me 
 Face to face 
 You wrap me 
 In Your embrace 
 When You look 
 Me in the eye 
 I know 
 You just want me now 
 You just want me now 
 So I give You 
 The highest praise 
 And I'll worship 
 For all my days 
 When I look 
 You in the eye 
 I know 
 I just want You now 
 I just want You now 
 I just want You now 
 I just want You now 
 You just want me now 
 You just want me now

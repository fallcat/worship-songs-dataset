Take me to that place Lord 
 Where there's nothing else but me and You 
 Longing for Your presence 
 I know that You're calling me to You 
 Here I stand 
 And long for Your embrace 
 Nothing else 
 Could ever take Your place 
 Come Holy Spirit 
 Fall in this place 
 I need more and more of You 
 Fill me again with the power of Your Spirit 
 Lord I'm crying out for more and more of You

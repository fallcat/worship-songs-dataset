God You breathed my existence 
 You're the One who holds my heart 
 You made me out of nothing 
 Fashioned every part 
 Always watching over me 
 Father I adore 
 Father I am Yours 
 Joy of my heart 
 Forever You are 
 My Father 
 Every breath every heartbeat 
 In the hollow of Your head 
 Every step how I need You 
 The lifter of my head 
 Before the dawn of time 
 Throughout eternity 
 You called me as Your own 
 A child of majesty 
 So I will lift my hands 
 And I will glorify Your Name

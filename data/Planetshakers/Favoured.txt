You're my Savior, You're my Healer 
 You're everything I need 
 You're my comfort, You're my best friend 
 Forever You will reign 
 You are high and lifted up 
 And Your Kingdom will have no end 
 I am favored I am blessed 
 By the cross, and the blood that was shed 
 I am favored I am blessed 
 I can do all things, because of what You've done for me 
 Nothing is impossible for those that believe 
 Nothing is to difficult for our God 
 Nothing is impossible for those that believe 
 I believe, I believe in You

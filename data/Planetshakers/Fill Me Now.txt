I think about You everyday 
 Thankful that You've washed my sins away 
 Knowing that it's love that brought me to Your side 
 I feel Your Spirit in my heart 
 Drawing me so ever close to You 
 Longing for the touch of You upon my life 
 All I know it's not by might or by my power 
 But it's by the Spirit of the Lord 
 Fill me now Holy One 
 Fill me to overflowing 
 Touch me now Worthy One 
 Your Power keeps me going 
 Breathe on me breath of life 
 I need You to fill me over 
 Come and breathe on me

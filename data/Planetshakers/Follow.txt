Where can I hide 
 Where Your love cannot reach me 
 Where can I go 
 Where Your arms, they're not here for me 
 Where can I run to 
 Where I cannot feel Your love 
 Cause Jesus Your love rescued me 
 So I'll follow after You 
 Wherever You take me 
 I'm following You 
 I'm gonna follow You 
 With everything I say 
 And everything I do 
 I'm gonna follow You 
 With every step I take 
 I know that You're with me 
 I know that You're with me 
 I'm gonna follow You 
 I'm taking up my cross 
 I'm following You 
 I'm gonna follow You 
 You're everything that I live for 
 I'll follow after You 
 Every day of my life Lord 
 I'll follow after You 
 I'll follow after You 
 I'm gonna follow You

All my life I've dreamed of this place 
 I've finally found my home 
 A place that I can run into Your arms 
 Here I stand, lost in Your embrace 
 My heart is overcome 
 Cause You've taken me 
 And turned my world upside down 
 As I long for You 
 You take me in Your arms 
 As I worship You 
 Wanna thank You for the things 
 You've done in me 
 For all You've done 
 I will lift my voice and shout aloud Your praise 
 For all You've done 
 In our hearts our lives will never be the same 
 For all You've done 
 I will tell the world of what You've done in me 
 Our hearts we give to You 
 With our lives we shout Your praise 
 For all You've done

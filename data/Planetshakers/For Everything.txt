When I found You 
 All became new 
 Now I live for You 
 Because You saved me 
 And You forgave me 
 I have been set free 
 Everything inside me gives You praise 
 For everything You've done in me 
 I will sing to You 
 And I will worship You 
 For everything! 
 For everything You are to me 
 I will shout Your praise 
 And live for You always 
 For everything! 
 No matter what I go through 
 I'll lift my praise up to You 
 In everything I will sing 
 My praise unto the King

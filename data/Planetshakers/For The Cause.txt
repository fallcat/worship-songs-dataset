For the cause of Christ 
 I will lay down my life 
 For the cause of Christ 
 I will stand 
 I will give my all to give Him glory, 
 For the cause of Christ 
 I live 
 You gave Your all for me 
 Came as a ransom to set me free 
 Love so amazing divine 
 Your blood shed on calvary for all mankind 
 I stand in awe 
 Of the wonders of Your love 
 I stand in awe of You

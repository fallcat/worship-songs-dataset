I hear the sound of the generation 
 Lifting their voice, rising as one 
 Now is the time for Your Name to be lifted high 
 Forever we'll sing of the things You have done 
 Nothing compares to Your power and love 
 Now is the time for Your Name to be lifted high 
 We lift Your name 
 Higher than any name 
 Forever we will sing 
 Glory to the King 
 Forever, forever 
 Name above all names 
 We will shout Your praise 
 Forever, forever 
 Ye-yeah...

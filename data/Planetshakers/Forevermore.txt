A new song I will sing 
 An offering I bring 
 My life is for the glory of my King 
 My all I give to You 
 Lord do what You must do 
 My heart is Yours and Yours alone 
 All I have is Yours 
 Use me as You will 
 I lay my whole life down for You 
 Forevermore I will worship 
 Forevermore I will sing 
 For You alone I will worship 
 Forevermore 
 I stand here in this place 
 In wonder of Your grace 
 My Jesus You are everything to me 
 My heart it sings Your praise 
 Lord lead me in Your ways 
 I'll follow You forevermore 
 Forever 
 Forevermore

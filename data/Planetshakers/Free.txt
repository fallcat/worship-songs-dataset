You saved me, You set me free 
 You healed me, You made me see 
 You set me free 
 You give me, all that I need 
 You give me, life abundantly 
 You set me free 
 All I wanna do 
 Is praise You 
 'Cause You have set me free 
 You're my saviour 
 You have set me free forever 
 It is by Your grace and power 
 That You have set me free 
 You are the way 
 I will live for You all my days 
 Never will I hold back my praise 
 'Cause You have set me free 
 There's freedom in the Name of Jesus 
 Freedom from all shame 
 There's freedom in the Name of Jesus 
 Freedom from all pain 
 There's freedom in the Name of Jesus 
 Freedom from all sin 
 There's freedom in the Name of Jesus 
 There's freedom in the Name of Jesus

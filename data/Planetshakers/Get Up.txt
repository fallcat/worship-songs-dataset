With every breath that I take 
 I'll praise You 
 With every move that I make 
 With everything that I am 
 I'll praise You 
 Cause there is no other way 
 We stand together with hearts joined as one 
 We'll give You glory for all You have done 
 Everybody get up 
 If you love Him! 
 Everybody get up 
 Get up and praise Him! 
 Everybody get up 
 If you're free 
 And give Him the praise! 
 You, You 
 Everything is all for 
 You, You 
 We're livin' each day for 
 You, You 
 Everything is all for 
 You, You

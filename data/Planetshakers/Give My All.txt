I bring my best praise 
 And I'm ready to give it all to You 
 I bring my whole heart 
 And I'm ready to pour it out on You 
 I bring my energy and passion 
 You're worthy of nothing less 
 Your love is stirring me to action 
 So I'm gonna give my best 
 I give my all to You 
 Cause You are worth it, Lord You deserve it 
 I give my all to You 
 All of my passion, my heart's reaction 
 You have it all, You have it all, You have it all 
 You have it all, You have it all, You have it all 
 You have it all 
 You have it all 
 I bring a new song 
 And I'm going to sing it out to You 
 I bring a fresh love 
 I'm trading the old in me for new 
 I bring my energy and passion 
 You're worthy of nothing less 
 Your love is stirring me to action 
 So I'm gonna give my best 
 I give my all to You 
 Cause You are worth it, Lord You deserve it 
 I give my all to You 
 All of my passion, my heart's reaction 
 You have it all, You have it all, You have it all 
 You have it all, You have it all, You have it all 
 You have it all 
 You have it all 
 As I praise and lift Your name, the walls come down 
 I celebrate, Your freedom reigns, it's breaking out 
 I give my all to You 
 Cause You are worth it, Lord You deserve it 
 I give my all to You 
 All of my passion, my heart's reaction 
 You have it all, You have it all, You have it all 
 You have it all, You have it all, You have it all 
 You have it all 
 You have it all 
 You have it all 
 You have it all

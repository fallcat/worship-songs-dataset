When I think of the things that you've done for me my Lord 
 How can I even start to explain the way I feel 
 Your love for me is so real 
 Takes away my deepest fears 
 Now I know that I stand with your power in my life 
 I need you by my side 
 I need you here with me 
 Lord you are my life 
 Come and set me free 
 Now that you are in my life 
 Everythings completely changed 
 I know for sure that things will never be the same 
 Now that I have found your love 
 I'm drawing closer everyday 
 For everything you've done in me 
 Gonna give you praise 
 I stand in awe of you

Such a tragedy, oh it's overtaken me 
 I never thought that this could be 
 I've got no one left 
 Tears flooded in my eyes, I couldn't even recognize 
 The One who caused the dead to rise was right in front of me 
 What a glorious collision when You came 
 And turned it around, death became life 
 Everything changed when You came into sight 
 The heartache was gone, the pain was undone 
 With just one touch of Your glorious love 
 You turned it around 
 You turned it around 
 Now I celebrate the miracle You did that day 
 All my tears You wiped away 
 And filled me with Your joy 
 Now I praise Your name 
 The name that's stronger than the grave 
 The name that has the power to save 
 And set the captives free 
 Oh the name of Jesus 
 And turned it around, death became life 
 Everything changed when You came into sight 
 The heartache was gone, the pain was undone 
 With just one touch of Your glorious love 
 You turned it around 
 Just one touch from You and all things are new 
 You reign over death and life 
 You are lifted high 
 And turned it around, death became life 
 Everything changed when You came into sight 
 The heartache was gone, the pain was undone 
 With just one touch of Your glorious love 
 You turned it around 
 You turned it around 
 You turned it around 
 You turned it around

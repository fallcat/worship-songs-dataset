I've been dreaming of you 
 In my dream I saw you touch my heart 
 All at once I was still 
 A peace within me that could not compare to 
 All I'd known and all I'd seen 
 Your touch gave me life 
 And now I sing 
 Glory to God forever 
 I'll praise you now and ever 
 Your love floods my thirsty soul 
 All majesty and power 
 Are yours Almighty Father 
 Great is your Holy name 
 I've been thinking of you 
 In my thoughts I heard you call my name 
 I felt a stirring within 
 A new beginning and a new found passion 
 It made me call out your name 
 With a desire to see all men saved 
 Holy 
 Holy 
 Holy 
 Is the Lord God Almighty 
 You reign 
 You reign over the earth

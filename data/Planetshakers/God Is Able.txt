 You part the ocean 
 You calm the raging sea 
 You are able to do this in me 
 You said You're for me 
 So who can stand against 
 You are with me Lord I know that 
 Nothing is too hard for You 2x 
 I know my God is able 
 I know His love never fails 
 I know my God is able 
 I believe in You 
 I trust in You with all I am 
 'Cause I know You have the master plan 
 So I'll throw my life into Your hands 
 For Your glory for Your glory

Holy spirit touch your people 
 Teach us the ways of god 
 As we live as Jesus did 
 You are in awe and lifted up 
 There's a stirring in the spirit 
 There an urgency in this sound 
 We as children must obey 
 Can you hear the footsteps of god 
 God is moving god is moving 
 Can you hear the sound of revival 
 God is moving god is moving 
 Can you hear the sound of revival 
 (As we praise you lord) 
 As we praise you as we sing 
 You're drawn into our soul god 
 As we cry out for this nation 
 Pour out revival in this land 
 There's a stirring in the spirit 
 There an urgency in this sound 
 We as children must obey 
 Can you hear the footsteps of god 
 God is moving god is moving 
 Can you hear the sound of revival 
 God is moving god is moving 
 Can you hear the sound of revival

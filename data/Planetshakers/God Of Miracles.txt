Blessed be the Lord, Oh my soul 
 Lord you are my God, take control 
 To you I give my life 
 God its yours 
 Blessed be the Lord 
 Blessed be the Lord 
 It's you 
 Who heals and forgives 
 It's you 
 Jesus I believe 
 You are God, you are the God of miracles 
 You're the God that makes me whole 
 I will worship 
 I will worship you 
 My soul longs for you 
 My soul longs for you 
 My soul longs for you 
 My soul longs for you

From the rising of the sun to where it sets 
 I will give you praise 
 And in every circumstance 
 You are good 
 I will give you praise 
 I know I've got nothing to fear in 
 Your love 
 Your love is holding me 
 I'll give I'll give 
 You all of me 
 You are so good to me 
 With everything I am 
 I'll give You praise 
 You're better than life to me 
 With everything I am 
 I'll give You praise 
 Thank You Jesus 
 You are faithful 
 Thank You Jesus 
 Your love is better than life

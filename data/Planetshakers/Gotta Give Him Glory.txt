How could I be still or keep quiet 
 When You're so good to me 
 You keep me smiling 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 This praise deep in my soul 
 Is overflowing 
 Losing all control 
 It keeps on going 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 How could I contain all Your blessing? 
 My cup overflows, it's running over 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 This praise deep in my soul 
 Is overflowing 
 Losing all control 
 It keeps on going 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 Gotta give Him glory 
 For the overflow 
 This praise deep in my soul 
 Is overflowing 
 Losing all control 
 It keeps on going 
 Gotta give Him glory

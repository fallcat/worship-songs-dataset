I stand in this place and lift 
 Up my eyes to see 
 THe glory of Your face 
 My God, how wonderful You are 
 How beautiful Your name 
 It calms the raging seas 
 With open arms I run into Your courts 
 I'll dance before You King of all the eath 
 You're great, great and mighty 
 King of glory, God of wonder 
 You're great, Ancient of Days 
 Keeper of my heart, lover of my soul 
 You are great and mighty 
 You are great and mighty 
 You are great and mighty 
 You are great 
 You are great 
 You are great

You are holy 
 You are righteous 
 Your name is above all names 
 You're my healer 
 My deliverable 
 And you reign for always 
 I will bow in worship of you 
 I will sing of all your graces 
 Great is the lord 
 Great is the lord 
 Your kingdom will reign 
 Every knee will bow 
 And tongue confess 
 Great is the lord 
 Jesus you alone are worthy...

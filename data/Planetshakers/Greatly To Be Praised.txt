Now, is the year of jubilee 
 It's the time for us to stand 
 And shout the victory 
 We cry out 
 Come and move in power 
 All across this land 
 In righteousness we stand 
 Jesus, King of my salvation 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 As we see this nation won 
 Let the earth sing 
 All creation praise Him 
 You alone are great 
 And You're greatly to praised 
 Every nation, every generation 
 We will lift Your Name 
 And live for You always

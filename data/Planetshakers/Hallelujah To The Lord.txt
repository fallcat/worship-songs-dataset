In the darkness let there be light 
 In the sorrow let joy arise 
 As Your kingdom fills the earth 
 God our Saviour 
 Giver of new birth 
 Let all sickness bow its knee 
 To Christ our Saviour our victory 
 By His death at calvary 
 I'm forgiven I have been set free 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 Hallelujah to our God 
 Lift Him higher above all things 
 Christ our Saviour 
 King above all Kings 
 Strength in weakness 
 Hope for the poor 
 Chains are broken my life restored 
 Grace abounding unending love 
 There is no one, no one like our God 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 Hallelujah to our God 
 Lift Him higher above all things 
 Christ our Saviour 
 King above all Kings 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 Hallelujah to our God 
 Lift Him higher above all things 
 Christ our Saviour 
 King above all Kings 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord, is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord, is the Lord 
 Hallelujah to the Lord 
 Hallelujah to our God 
 Lift Him higher above all things 
 Christ our Saviour 
 King above all Kings 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord, is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Holy, Holy is the Lord, is the Lord

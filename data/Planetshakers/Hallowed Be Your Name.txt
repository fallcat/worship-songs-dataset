Hallowed be Your Name 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 Lord and majesty, divine authority 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 Holy Holy, Lord You are worthy 
 And I'm honoured to sing Your praise 
 King of glory, God Almighty 
 Hallowed be Your Name 
 All creation, every nation 
 Has its being by Your Word 
 As it is done up in Heaven 
 Let it be done here on earth 
 Let it be done here on earth

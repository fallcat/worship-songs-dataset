 Oh, He touched me so deep inside 
 And oh the joy, supernatural, supernatural joy, that touched my soul 
 Something, oh, did you know it happened, between me and Jesus 
 Oh and now I know 
 Oh, He touched me, He touched me, He touched me, He touched me and made me whole 
 Praise His name 
 He touched me 
 He touched me 
 And oh the joy that floods my soul 
 Something happened and now I know 
 He touched me and made me whole

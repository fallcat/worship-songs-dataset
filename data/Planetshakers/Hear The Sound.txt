Can you hear the sound, 
 Of heaven in this place 
 Hear it all around, 
 As the earth resound in praise 
 I can hear You're calling out to me, 
 I can feel You're reaching out to me 
 All for You, 
 God we'll praise You now, 
 Hear the sound of the voices crying out 
 All across the world 
 We'll stand with hearts as one, 
 Bringing praise to You, 
 All the praise to You 
 All glory, all power, 
 Forever we will praise Your name 
 All glory, all power, 
 Forever we will sing

Something in my heart 
 Is burning like a fire 
 I want to live for You 
 I need Your touch right now 
 Fill me with Your power 
 Power to live for You my God 
 I will not be moved 
 I will stand for You 
 I will go where You send me 
 Jesus take me now I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 I lay my life on the altar 
 Everything I give to You alone 
 Here I am 
 Here I am 
 Send me

Create in me 
 A heart that is clean 
 'Cause I want to be 
 Who You want me to be 
 The depths of my soul 
 Are Yours Lord to mould 
 'Cause I want to be 
 Who You want me to be 
 Holy Spirit fill me 
 Overwhelm me 
 Holy Spirit use me 
 For Your glory 
 Here's my life 
 Let it be a living sacrifice 
 All that I am 
 Surrender into Your hands 
 I surrender 
 No matter where 
 No matter when 
 Lord I will go 
 Where You want me to go 
 Holy Spirit fill me 
 Overwhelm me 
 Holy Spirit use me 
 For Your glory 
 Here's my life 
 Let it be a living sacrifice 
 All that I am 
 Surrender into Your hands 
 I surrender 
 Here I am 
 Jesus let Your will be done in me 
 All that I am 
 Surrender into Your hands 
 I surrender 
 I give it all 
 My heart and soul

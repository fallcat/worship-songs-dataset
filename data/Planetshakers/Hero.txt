Know me like I do 
 I know I'm nothing without You 
 I need Your spirit in my heart 
 Show me ways I'll never depart 
 Now all I need to say is how much I need You 
 You're all I long to see 
 My friend who gave His life for me 
 You're All I Long to be 
 Jesus, the Hero inside of me is You 
 Jesus, You're my Hero 
 Jesus, You're my Hero 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus the hero in me

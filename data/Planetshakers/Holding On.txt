Here it goes 
 I'm letting go 
 Of all that's weighing me down 
 I believe 
 With everything 
 That you are all that I need 
 So I look to you 
 And not to this world 
 I am found in You 
 And You are found in me 
 You're the centre of my everything 
 You're the rock on which I stand 
 My foundation is in Jesus 
 I'm holding on to you forever 
 I'm reaching out 
 For more of You 
 Come and fill me again 
 More of You 
 And less of me 
 That is how it should be 
 So I look to you 
 And not to this world 
 I am found in You 
 And You are found in me 
 You're the center of my everything 
 You're the rock on which I stand 
 My foundation is in Jesus 
 I'm holding on to you forever 
 You're the center of my everything 
 You're the rock on which I stand 
 My foundation is in Jesus 
 I'm holding on to you forever 
 I'm holding on to you forever 
 Cause no one else can be the centre 
 You are the only one for me now 
 Lord it's You 
 I'm holding on to you forever 
 Cause no one else can be the center 
 You are the only one for me now 
 Lord it's You 
 I'm holding on to you forever 
 Cause no one else can be the center 
 You are the only one for me now 
 Lord it's You 
 Your the centre of my everything 
 Your the rock on which I stand 
 My foundation is in Jesus 
 I'm holding on to you forever 
 You're the centre of my everything 
 You're the rock on which I stand 
 My foundation is in Jesus 
 I'm holding on to you forever

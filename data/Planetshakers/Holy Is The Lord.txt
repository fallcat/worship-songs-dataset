I can see the angels gathering 
 'Round the Throne to bring an offering 
 Of praise to the King of all Kings 
 It's Jesus 
 I can hear their voices singing loud 
 Bringing anthems in a glorious cloud 
 Of praise to the King of all Kings 
 It's Jesus 
 Nations will join and men confess 
 Declaring Your holy righteousness 
 Giving their hearts, their lives, their all 
 To the King of Glory 
 Mountains declare and oceans roar 
 All of creation stands in awe 
 Join with them now in one accord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 All of the angels stand and sing 
 The anthem of heaven loudly rings 
 Hear them proclaim this offering 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord

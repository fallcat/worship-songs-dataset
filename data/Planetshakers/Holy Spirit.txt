You're all I need 
 You're all I breathe 
 It's You that I'm thirsting for 
 It's You I seek 
 On bended knee 
 It's You that I'm longing for 
 I want to worship You only 
 In spirit and in truth 
 Longing for Your anointing 
 To fall on me 
 Let it fall from heaven 
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit 
 Come Holy Spirit 
 Come pour out Your oil anointing 
 We need Your power 
 We need Your strength 
 Come pour it out Lord 
 Open heaven

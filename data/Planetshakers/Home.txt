Now, my heart is open now 
 Your love advances, breaks my defences down 
 Go, Jesus, I'm letting go 
 Your grace is greater than every failure 
 Now I'm coming 
 Home, I know I am home 
 Safe within my Saviour's arms 
 Right back where I belong 
 Home 
 Home 
 Fall, Father, You broke my fall 
 Your mercy found me, wrapped arms around me 
 Now I'm coming 
 Now I'm running 
 Home, I know I am home 
 Safe within my Saviour's arms 
 Right back where I belong 
 Home, I'm forgiven, home 
 I hear Heaven's angels sing 
 Father, You welcome me 
 Home 
 Home 
 I'm running, running, into Your arms 
 I'm running, running, into Your heart 
 Your presence is my home 
 I'm running, running, hands lifted high 
 I'm running, running, heart open wide 
 Your presence is my home 
 Home, I know I am home 
 Safe within my Saviour's arms 
 Right back where I belong 
 Home, I'm forgiven, home 
 I hear Heaven's angels sing 
 Father, You welcome me 
 I'm running, running, into Your arms 
 I'm running, running, into Your heart 
 Your presence is my home 
 I'm running, running, hands lifted high 
 I'm running, running, heart open wide 
 Your presence is my home 
 Your presence is my home 
 Your presence is my home

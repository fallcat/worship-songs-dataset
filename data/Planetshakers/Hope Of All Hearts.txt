The world may fade 
 You will remain 
 In the midst of the trial 
 You will always be all the same 
 Our God never fails 
 Our God never fails 
 With hope and light 
 You reign over all 
 Though my heart may fail 
 You will always be all the same 
 Our God never fails 
 Our God never fails 
 Praise in the morning 
 Praise in the evening 
 Praise when I'm laughing 
 Praise when I'm greiving 
 There will be dancing 
 There will be singing 
 Upon injustice we will tell of our god 
 The hope of all hearts 
 The hope of all hearts 
 Is you 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails 
 With hope and light 
 You reign over all 
 Though my heart may fail 
 You will always be all the same 
 Our God never fails 
 Our God never fails 
 Praise in the morning 
 Praise in the evening 
 Praise when I'm laughing 
 Praise when I'm greiving 
 There will be dancing 
 There will be singing 
 Upon injustice we will tell of our god 
 The hope of all hearts 
 The hope of all hearts 
 Is you 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails 
 The hope of all hearts 
 The hope of all hearts 
 Is you 
 Your love never fails 
 Your love never fails 
 In the darkness 
 In triumph, my soul shall sing 
 Of his mercy, and kindness 
 Our offering of praise 
 Our God never fails 
 Our God never fails 
 In darkness 
 In triumph, my soul shall sing 
 Of his mercy, and kindness 
 Our offering of praise 
 Our God never fails 
 Our God never fails

There is no one like our God 
 No other like our God, for He alone is worthy 
 There is no one like our King 
 No other like our King, for He alone is holy 
 The honor, the glory, the praise O God 
 Be lifted so high in this place 
 Lord of all the Heavens 
 Jesus Christ the Name above all names 
 Your love is greater 
 Lord of all creation 
 I'm taken by the wonder of Your Name 
 Your love is greater 
 We cry hosanna, hosanna 
 Your Name be lifted up 
 Forever hosanna, hosanna 
 So high and lifted up

Here I stand 
 Before you my heart is still 
 Wanting just to be with you 
 Waiting here 
 Long for your voice to speak 
 Touch me now 
 It's your face I seek 
 How my soul longs for you 
 To be with you 
 Adore you 
 Nothing more I want to do 
 Than to sing to you 
 Jesus I'm in love with you 
 Speak to me 
 Whisper you words of truth 
 Take my heart 
 Won't you make me new 
 Jesus, how I love you 
 How I love you 
 On my knees 
 Before you I lay my life 
 Giving all 
 A living sacrifice 
 Take my life 
 And all that I long to be 
 Set apart 
 Only for you my king 
 How my soul longs for you 
 To be with you 
 Adore you 
 Nothing more I want to do 
 Than to sing to you 
 Jesus I'm in love with you 
 Speak to me 
 Whisper your words of truth 
 Take my heart 
 Won't you make me new 
 Jesus, how I love you 
 How I love you 
 How my soul longs for you 
 How my soul longs for you 
 How my soul longs for you 
 How my soul longs for you

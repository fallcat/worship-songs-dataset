All it takes is one moment 
 And just one touch from You 
 I put aside all distractions 
 I came for You, I came for You 
 I need You more than ever 
 Nothing else satisfies 
 All my life I surrender 
 I'll live for You, I'll live for You 
 I came for You, I came for You 
 Holy Spirit, You are welcome 
 Come and move upon this place 
 We desire an encounter once again 
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit 
 Now that my heart is open 
 I am ready for You 
 Jesus, take me deeper 
 I came for You, I came for You 
 I came for You, I came for You 
 Holy Spirit, You are welcome 
 Come and move upon this place 
 We desire an encounter once again 
 Send your fire, release Your power 
 So we'll never be the same 
 We desire an encounter once again 
 We make way, we make room 
 Lord, let Your spirit move 
 Have Your way in this place 
 Lord we have come for You 
 We make way, we make room 
 Lord, let Your spirit move 
 Have Your way in this place 
 Lord we have come for You 
 We make way, we make room 
 Lord, let Your spirit move 
 Have Your way in this place 
 Lord we have come for You 
 Holy Spirit, You are welcome 
 Come and move upon this place 
 We desire an encounter once again 
 Send your fire, release Your power 
 So we'll never be the same 
 We desire an encounter once again 
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit 
 Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit 
 We make way, we make room 
 Lord, let Your spirit move 
 Have Your way in this place 
 Lord we have come for You

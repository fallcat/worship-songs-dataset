I can feel the power 
 Of Jesus all over me 
 Sounds like a rushing wind 
 A holy fire fills this place 
 Let me stand in awe and worship 
 The God of saving grace 
 My responsive heart is open 
 As I feel this personal embrace 
 It's the Power in the Person 
 Of the Holy Ghost 
 He is real 
 I know He lives 
 He's alive, 'cause He's so real 
 In my life

More than a nice melody 
 More than the sweetest of words 
 This is the love I have found 
 And in this love I am found 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You, my Lord 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You 
 Never could I comprehend 
 The love You so freely give 
 Never could I be worthy 
 But Your love covers all of my sin 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You, my Lord 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You 
 There is no greater love than Yours 
 Nothing else could ever compare 
 And even if I searched all the world 
 I would never find a love like Yours 
 There is no greater love than Yours 
 Nothing else could ever compare 
 And even if I searched all the world 
 I would never find a love like Yours 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You, my Lord 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You, my Lord 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You, my Lord 
 I just want You, Jesus 
 I just want You

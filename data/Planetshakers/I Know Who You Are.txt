In the mountain air 
 In the valley low 
 You are always there 
 You are always close 
 I can feel Your grace 
 as You guide my steps 
 In the darkest place 
 I know who You are 
 Woah 
 Lord, Maker, Saviour 
 I know that through it all 
 You are greater 
 Your love for me 
 Will never fade away 
 Those who hope in You 
 Will never be ashamed 
 I Know who You are 
 You have walked the earth 
 And you understand 
 You know every hurt 
 And You hold my hand 
 Though the storms may rage 
 They still know Your Name 
 Oh Jesus 
 I know who You are 
 Woah 
 I know who You are 
 Woah 
 Lord, Maker, Saviour 
 I know that through it all 
 You are greater 
 Your love for me 
 Will never fade away 
 Those who hope in You 
 Will never be ashamed 
 Lord, Maker, Saviour 
 I know that through it all 
 You are greater 
 Your love for me 
 Will never fade away 
 Those who hope in You 
 Will never be ashamed 
 'Cause I know who You are 
 I may not have much left but You provide 
 With every waking breath 
 I'll lift You high 
 You hear my every breath 
 You are by my side 
 God I know You 
 God I trust You 
 I may not have much left but You provide 
 With every waking breath 
 I'll lift You high 
 You hear my every breath 
 You are by my side 
 God I know You 
 God I trust You 
 Lord, Maker, Saviour 
 I know that through it all 
 You are greater 
 Your love for me 
 Will never fade away 
 Those who hope in You 
 Will never be ashamed 
 I know who You are, Jesus 
 I know who You are, Jesus 
 I know who You are Jesus 
 I know who You are Jesus 
 I know who You are

Let my words, and my heart 
 Honour You, Lord in all of my life 
 Let Your power, shine in me 
 Let the church, be Your light in this world 
 Lord when I'm weak, You are strong 
 When in need I know that You are everyhting 
 You are all that I long for 
 I need You, more than words can say 
 More and more each day 
 Jesus I love you 
 I need You, more than life itself 
 Jesus I will worship You 
 Forevermore 
 You're worthy of all my praise 
 Name above every name 
 I exalt You 
 I exalt You

Waiting my heart open 
 Hands raised to You 
 Longing for Your touch 
 To come make me new 
 My life I lay down 
 My heart and my soul 
 Lord I surrender 
 I give You my all 
 Every part of my life Lord 
 Is Yours and Yours alone 
 Every beat of my heart 
 God is Yours 
 I surrender to You 
 I surrender to You 
 I lay my life at your feet 
 I surrender to You 
 My life I lay down 
 My heart and my soul 
 Lord I surrender 
 I give You my control 
 God I give You every part of me 
 Take my everything it's You that I seek 
 All I want is to be where You are 
 I'm Yours

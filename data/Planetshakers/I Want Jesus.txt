Here I am Lord vulnerable 
 Ready for You to come and move 
 This is where my heart belongs 
 With Your Presence come and consume me 
 I feel wonder fill the room 
 You're here, I am overwhelmed 
 As I let go I receive 
 With Your Presence come and consume me 
 Come and consume me 
 I want Jesus 
 More than anything 
 I want Jesus 
 All over again 
 I live life each day in Your embrace 
 I want Jesus 
 I want Jesus 
 Feels like heaven when You're here 
 Waves of glory cover me 
 Let Your spirit saturate 
 With Your presence come and consume me 
 Come and consume me 
 I want Jesus 
 More than anything 
 I want Jesus 
 All over again 
 I live life each day in Your embrace

 I want Jesus 
 All over again 
 I live life each day in Your embrace

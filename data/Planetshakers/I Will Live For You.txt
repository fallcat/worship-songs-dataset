You are so faithful 
 Your word is true 
 No one is like you 
 In all that you do 
 You are so worthy 
 I give you the praise 
 So I give my all to honor you 
 And I raise my hands 
 And I will lift up my praise 
 Holy is the Lord God 
 In all the earth 
 I will praise the Lord 
 With my mind, soul and strength 
 He is high and lifted up above 
 Jesus You are my God 
 I will live for you

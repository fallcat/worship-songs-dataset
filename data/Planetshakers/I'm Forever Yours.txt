I give my all to You 
 Send me and I will go for You 
 To the ends of the earth 
 I'll follow after You 
 I want the world to know 
 Your Love endures forever 
 Tell me and I'll obey 
 This is far greater the sacrifice 
 Trusting you and not mmyself 
 Will always lead to blessing 
 Lord have your way in me 
 Not my will, Yours be done 
 Here I stand within Your Presence 
 Longing for Your touch 
 A thousand days cannot compare 
 To one day in Your courts 
 Hold me now and never let me go 
 My Jesus, my Precious Saviour 
 I'm forever Yours 
 I will worship You forever 
 I will worship You

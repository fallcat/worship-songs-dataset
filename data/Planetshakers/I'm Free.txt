Joy, there's a joy in my soul 
 I can't explain it but I know it's You 
 Light, oh I'm feeling so light 
 Like a weight has been lifted by You 
 Jesus, You are my breakthrough, it's You 
 Now I'm free, yeah 
 There is nothing holding me 
 I'm free, yeah 
 Cause You died and rose for me 
 Now I'm free 
 Peace, there's a peace in my heart 
 There's a power that's with me, it's You 
 Jesus, You are my breakthrough, it's You 
 Now I'm free, yeah 
 There is nothing holding me 
 I'm free, yeah 
 Cause You died and rose for me 
 Now I'm free, yeah 
 There is nothing holding me 
 I'm free, yeah 
 Cause You died and rose for me 
 Now I'm free 
 No weapon formed against me, will overcome 
 The enemy's defeated, Jesus has won 
 No weapon formed against me, will overcome 
 The enemy's defeated, Jesus has won 
 Now I'm free, yeah 
 There is nothing holding me 
 I'm free, yeah 
 Cause You died and rose for me

 There is nothing holding me 
 I'm free, yeah 
 Cause You died and rose for me 
 Now I'm free

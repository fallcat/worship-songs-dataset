Let the heavens and the earth 
 Shout Your majesty and glory 
 Let the oceans sing their song 
 Every tongue will tell its story 
 Of Your majesty 
 And Your neverending power 
 Let the whole earth sing to You 
 I will give my heart to You 
 In everything I do 
 'Cause You are the One I'm living for 
 I will lift my hands in praise 
 Serve You all my days 
 For You are the One I'm living for 
 You are the One I'm living for

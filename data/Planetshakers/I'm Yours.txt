Oh Lord 
 When I think of all You've done 
 My heart sings of Your love 
 That saved my soul 
 And made me whole 
 My life is Yours 
 'Cause You paid the price 
 I give You my life, I'm Yours 
 So no matter what the cost 
 I will go for You 
 No matter what it takes, I'm Yours 
 Because You paid the price at Calvary 
 I give You my whole life, I'm Yours 
 Oh Lord 
 My everything to You I lift 
 My heart and soul I live 
 For You alone 
 I'm not my own 
 My life is Yours 
 I'm Yours 
 Jesus I am Yours

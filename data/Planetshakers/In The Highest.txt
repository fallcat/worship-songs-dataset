In Your outstretched arms 
 I've found love unfailing 
 Grace abounds to me 
 Never let me go 
 I'll trust in You forever 
 You're my strength, my joy 
 All of my hope is found in You 
 All of my days belong to You 
 Glory to God in the highest 
 Power and strength to Your Name 
 Heaven and earth will proclaim 
 You Lord of all 
 Blessed be Your Name 
 Jesus 
 All I want is You 
 All I want is You 
 Jesus

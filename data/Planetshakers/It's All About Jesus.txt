It's all about Jesus 
 It's all about the way he changed our lives 
 It's all about Jesus 
 The power of his blood can't be denied 
 It's all about Jesus 
 It's all about the covenant he made 
 It's all about Jesus 
 Victorious he rose up from the grave 
 We lift our hearts to him 
 He is the reason that we sing 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, 
 We praise your name 
 It's all about Jesus 
 It's all about the way he set us free 
 It's all about Jesus 
 Bearing all our sins at Calvary 
 It's all about Jesus 
 It's all about the gift of love he gave 
 It's all about Jesus 
 The precious lamb of God was slain 
 We lift our hearts to him 
 He is the reason that we sing 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We praise your name 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We praise your name 
 We lift our hearts to him 
 He is the reason that we sing 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We praise your name 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We praise your name 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We praise your name 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 We praise your name

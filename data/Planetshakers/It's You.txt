Come on come on let this song of praise rise 
 Come on come on lift a shout of freedom 
 Come on come on sing about His goodness 
 Come on come on give Him all your praise now 
 Its time to celebrate and make a joyful noise 
 For He alone is great and greatly to be praised 
 It's You there's no one greater no one better than You God 
 It's You Your love is stronger like no other God it's You

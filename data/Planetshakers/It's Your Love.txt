From the start You loved me 
 You saw who I could be 
 So you gave Your life to save my soul 
 I don't know where I'd be 
 If not for Your mercy 
 All I know is You have won it all 
 Whoa, Now I am forgiven 
 Whoa, Your grace has set me free 
 Whoa, Now I'm really living 
 Whoa 
 Your love is never giving up 
 It's never giving up on me yeah 
 Your grace came and made a way 
 I'll never be the same forever 
 It's Your love 
 Lord I want to thank You 
 For all that I've been through 
 'Cause now I see that You are in control 
 Whoa, Now I am forgiven 
 Whoa, Your grace has set me free 
 Whoa, Now I'm really living 
 Whoa

 I can hear the sound of the broken chains 
 Freedom is alive running through my veins 
 Victory is mine over sin and shame 
 I am free, I am free

 Freedom is alive running through my veins 
 Victory is mine over sin and shame

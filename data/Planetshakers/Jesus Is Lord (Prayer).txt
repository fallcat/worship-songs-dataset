We love You Jesus 
 There's no one like You 
 All powerful, All glorious, All majestic 
 The holy One, the anointed One 
 The all conquering King 
 The King of all kings 
 The Lord of all lords 
 The lamb that was slained 
 The lily of the valley 
 The bright and morning star 
 The lion of the tribe of Judah 
 O Your name is Jesus 
 That name that is above every name 
 That is the name of Jesus 
 Every knee has to bow 
 Every tongue confess 
 That Jesus Christ is Lord 
 Jesus is Lord 
 Jesus is Lord 
 Jesus is Lord 
 Over every sickness 
 Over every pain 
 Over every trouble 
 Over every heartache 
 Over every suffering 
 Jesus is Lord 
 He's the Lord of every city 
 He's the Lord of every nation 
 He's the Lord of all the earth 
 He is our soon coming King 
 And we worship You 
 We exalt You 
 We lift You up 
 We magnify You

 He's changing the atmosphere of addiction 
 He's changing the atmosphere of depression 
 He's changing the atmosphere of worry 
 He's changing the atmosphere of lies

 Oh He's risen from the death 
 He is awesome, He is awesome

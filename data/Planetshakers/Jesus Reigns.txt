May my life, speak Your words 
 May my heart, beat with Yours 
 Let Your light shine in me, 
 For all my days 
 God of grace, God of truth, 
 Lord my soul, longs for You 
 I will live for You God, 
 For all my days 
 Jesus Christ, the name above all names 
 Risen king, we long to bring You praise 
 Jesus reigns 
 All glory to Your name, 
 All power to Your name, 
 Forever 
 Jesus reigns 
 Let all creation praise, 
 The name above all name, 
 Forever, Jesus reigns 
 Spirit of God, 
 We cry out for You now, 
 We cry out, 
 Where would we be without You Jesus, 
 Where would we be without You Lord

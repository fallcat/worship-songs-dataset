What a glorious picture, all of heaven united 
 Singing loud with one focus, lifting our Jesus higher 
 Holy is the Lord, singing Holy is the Lord 
 He is shining with brilliance, overflowing with beauty 
 We are all captivated by the One who is worthy 
 Holy is the Lord, singing Holy is the Lord 
 Join with the angels, singing powerful melodies 
 Bringing worship, we're on our knees, crying holy 
 All of Heaven, giving praise unto the King 
 With a thunderous voice we sing 
 For He is holy 
 He is holy 
 What an awesome encounter 
 As we come and surrender 
 Giving all of the honour, all the glory and power 
 Holy is the Lord, singing Holy is the Lord 
 Join with the angels, singing powerful melodies 
 Bringing worship, we're on our knees, crying holy 
 All of Heaven, giving praise unto the King 
 With a thunderous voice we sing 
 For He is holy 
 For He is holy 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 For He is worthy, the King of glory 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 For He is Holy, God Almighty 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 For He is worthy, the King of glory 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 For He is Holy, God Almighty 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 For He is worthy, the King of glory 
 Lift Him up, lift Him up 
 For He is Holy, God Almighty 
 Join with the angels, singing powerful melodies 
 Bringing worship, we're on our knees, crying holy 
 All of Heaven, giving praise unto the King 
 With a thunderous voice we sing 
 For He is holy

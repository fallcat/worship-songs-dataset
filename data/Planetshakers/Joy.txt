You've turned it all around 
 Where I was hurting 
 Now I'm rejoicing 
 In Your love I'm found 
 And I have joy 
 Woah 
 You took away my pain 
 You turned my mourning into dancing 
 I can smile again 'cause I have joy 
 Woah 
 Let the celebration begin 
 Make a joyful noise unto Him 
 Come on everybody 
 Let's give Him praise for He is good 
 You have given me a joy that won't stop 
 And will never leave, so I will praise You with gladness 
 For You are good 
 You have given me a joy that won't stop 
 And will never leave, so I will praise You with gladness 
 For You are good 
 You've turned my sadness into gladness 
 You've turned my sorrow into joy 
 Now I'm singing and I'm dancing 
 And I will shout for joy 
 You've turned my sadness into gladness 
 You've turned my sorrow into joy 
 Now I'm singing and I'm dancing 
 And I will shout for joy 
 You've turned my sadness into gladness 
 You've turned my sorrow into joy 
 Now I'm singing and I'm dancing 
 And I will shout for joy 
 You have given me a joy that won't stop 
 And will never leave, so I will praise You with gladness 
 For You are good 
 You have given me a joy that won't stop 
 And will never leave, so I will praise You with gladness 
 For You are good 
 For You are good 
 For You are good

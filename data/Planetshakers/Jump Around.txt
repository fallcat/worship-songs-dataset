Somebody get your praise on 
 There is one thing that I know for sure 
 How much I love You yet You love me more 
 You paid my debt a price I could not pay 
 So I will praise You each and every day 
 I'm not gonna hold back now 
 I think it's time to just get up 
 And jump around now 
 Everybody jump around 
 In the house of God 
 Hey, hey jump around 
 Everybody jump around 
 In the house of God 
 Everybody 
 When I say Jesus 
 You say praise Him 
 Jesus praise Him 
 Jesus praise Him 
 There is one thing that I can't ignore 
 The power of praising You in one accord 
 Our praise goes up, the walls come down 
 Listen up people I can hear that sound 
 Praise Him, jump jump 
 Come on praise Him, jump jump 
 Praise Him, jump jump 
 Somebody get your praise on 
 Somebody get your 
 Some-somebody get your praise on

Let me tell you 'bout an awesome God 
 Who loved this world enough to lay His life down for it 
 Sent His one and only Son 
 So that when we believe we will have life forever 
 Lost without a sacrifice 
 But as He hung on the cross it was You and me He died for 
 When He rose up from the grave 
 He put the enemy beneath our feet forever 
 Jumpin' Praisin' 
 Liftin' up the name of Christ our Saviour 
 Jumpin' Praisin' 
 Tellin' all about our God who lives forever 
 Praise Him 
 Come on everybody lift up voices 
 Praise Him 
 Come on everybody lift up your hands now 
 Praise Him 
 Come on everybody lift up your feet now 
 Praise Him 
 Come on everybody lift up our Saviour

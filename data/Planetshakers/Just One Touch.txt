I am free, every sin has been erased 
 By the power of Your grace 
 I am healed, every sickness and disease 
 Has no hold on me 
 'Cause I believe 
 Yes I believe 
 Hallelujah 
 You said it's done, death is overcome 
 Hallelujah 
 You washed me clean and now I'm free 
 I am blessed, O' my cup it overflows 
 Beyond all that I can hold 
 I am saved, by the power of Your name 
 I will never be the same 
 'Cause I believe 
 Yes I believe 
 Hallelujah 
 You said it's done, death is overcome 
 Hallelujah 
 You washed me clean and now I'm free 
 With just one touch 
 Every burden fell off my shoulders 
 With just one touch 
 Every mountain swept away 
 Now goodbye guilt and shame 
 He's overcome the grave 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher 
 With just one touch 
 Every burden fell off my shoulders 
 With just one touch 
 Every mountain swept away 
 Now goodbye guilt and shame 
 He's overcome the grave 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher 
 Hallelujah 
 You said it's done, death is overcome 
 Hallelujah 
 You washed me clean and now I'm free 
 Hallelujah 
 You said it's done, death is overcome 
 Hallelujah 
 You washed me clean and now I'm free 
 With just one touch 
 Every burden fell off my shoulders 
 With just one touch 
 Every mountain swept away 
 Now goodbye guilt and shame 
 He's overcome the grave 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher 
 With just one touch 
 Every burden fell off my shoulders 
 With just one touch 
 Every mountain swept away 
 Now goodbye guilt and shame 
 He's overcome the grave 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher 
 We lift the name of Jesus higher

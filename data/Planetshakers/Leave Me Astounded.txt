All my hands have made I'm laying down 
 All that I hold dear, my many crowns 
 I've tasted and seen of Your great love 
 You satisfy me 
 You satisfy me 
 Spirit fall, open up heaven's door 
 We're waiting with worship for more 
 You're the only love that satisfies me 
 My constant request above all things 
 Every hour I wake, be near me 
 Though I've tasted and seen of Your great love 
 Show me Your glory 
 Show me Your glory 
 Show me Your glory 
 Show me Your glory 
 Spirit fall, open up heaven's door 
 We're waiting with worship for more 
 You're the only love that satisfies me 
 Lord we run into Your loving arms 
 We're safe and secure in Your love 
 You're the only love that satisfies me 
 Leave me astounded, leave me amazed 
 Show off Your glory, let heaven invade 
 We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise 
 For the almighty presence of God to invade 
 Leave me astounded, leave me amazed 
 Show off Your glory, let heaven invade 
 We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise 
 For the almighty presence of God to invade 
 Spirit fall, open up heaven's door 
 We're waiting with worship for more 
 You're the only love that satisfies me 
 Lord we run into Your loving arms 
 We're safe and secure in Your love 
 You're the only love that satisfies me 
 Leave me astounded, leave me amazed 
 Show off Your glory, let heaven invade 
 We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise 
 For the almighty presence of God to invade 
 Leave me astounded, leave me amazed 
 Show off Your glory, let heaven invade 
 We're waiting with worship, we're waiting with praise 
 For the almighty presence of God to invade

The shadows of my yesterday 
 Clouded up my faith to pray 
 But You blew it all away 
 The voices tried to pull me down 
 And bury me into the ground 
 But You made the greater sound 
 And now I hear You calling me 
 The voice of a raging sea 
 This is your destiny 
 Let's go! 
 Let the music play 
 It's time to celebrate 
 'Cause it's a brand new day 
 Let's go! 
 We are so alive 
 And God is on our side 
 Ooh, o-o-o-oh 
 Ooh, let's go! 
 With Your blood You sacrificed 
 Giving all You paid the price 
 You have opened paradise 
 And now I hear You calling me 
 The voice of a raging sea 
 This is your destiny 
 Let's go! 
 Let the music play 
 It's time to celebrate 
 'Cause it's a brand new day 
 Let's go! 
 We are so alive 
 And God is on our side 
 Ooh, o-o-o-oh 
 Ooh, let's go! 
 Your glory rises like the sun 
 Radiating life to everyone 
 Now death is over and I'm alive 
 I'm taking hold of this victory 
 Now I'm running in my destiny 
 For Your glory I will go 
 Your glory rises like the sun 
 Radiating life to everyone 
 Now death is over and I'm alive 
 I'm taking hold of this victory 
 Now I'm running in my destiny 
 For Your glory I will go 
 Let's go! 
 Let's go! 
 Let's go! 
 Let the music play 
 It's time to celebrate 
 'Cause it's a brand new day 
 Let's go! 
 We are so alive 
 And God is on our side 
 Ooh, o-o-o-oh 
 Ooh, let's go!

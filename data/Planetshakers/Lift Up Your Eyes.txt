I see heaven before me 
 Angels passing around me 
 Here I stand in awe of your beauty 
 Captured by your holiness 
 Lift up your eyes 
 All of heaven's in worship 
 Angels rejoice and the clouds will be filled 
 With the wonder of your name 
 With the wonder of your name 
 The train of his robe fills the temple with glory 
 Heavenly hosts fall before him in worship 
 Crying Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty

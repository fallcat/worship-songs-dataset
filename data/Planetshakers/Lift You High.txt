Who can save the lost 
 Who can heal all sickness 
 Who can make me new 
 No one else but Jesus 
 There's no other name 
 There's no other name 
 We lift You high, higher than all others 
 We lift You high, higher than all else 
 For great are You Lord and worthy of all the 
 Glory and honor and praise 
 Who can make me whole 
 Who can take all my sin 
 Who can cleanse this heart 
 No one else but Jesus 
 You are my God, The Great I am 
 And You are the rock on which I stand 
 And You reign, You reign O Lord 
 You reign, You reign

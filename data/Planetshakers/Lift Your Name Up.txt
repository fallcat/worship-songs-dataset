I'm gonna lift You up 
 Higher than all things 
 Above every name 
 Cause You are my God and King 
 You made everything 
 So I give You all my praise 
 I'm gonna lift Your name up 
 So everyone can see You live in me 
 Shine Your light in me

 Jesus I will lift Your name up 
 Let Your Spirit fall on me 
 Now so that all the 
 World will know that You're my God 
 Jesus I will lift Your name up 
 I'm so in love with You 
 Everything You do 
 Everything You say 
 You never let me go 
 You're always in control 
 And I give You all my praise 
 Jesus I will lift 
 Your name up 
 Higher than all other names 
 You are my God 
 You are my King 
 You are my

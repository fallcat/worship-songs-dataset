Like a fire shut up in my bones 
 I want the world to know You are God 
 With a passion burning deep within 
 I want the world to know that You live 
 Let Your presence come and saturate 
 Every part of me make me new 
 Let Your Spirit come and move within 
 Fill me once again 'cause I need more 
 Jesus I'm desperate for You 
 Jesus I'm hungry for You 
 Jesus I'm longing for You 
 Lord You are all I want 
 Come like a flood and saturate me now 
 You're all I want 
 Come like the wind 
 And sweep throughout this place 
 You're all we want

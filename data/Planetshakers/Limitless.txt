 I'm saying hello to the God of all creation 
 There are no limits with you

 You're limitless, nothing's too hard for you 
 You're limitless, there's nothing you cannot do 
 You are bigger, and you're greater, and you're stronger I know 
 You're limitless, you're limitless

 We'll keep exceeding the limits until He comes back

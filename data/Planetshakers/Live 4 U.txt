You knew me before I was born 
 You knew every mistake that I would make 
 You chose me to walk by your side 
 You even knew the path that I would take 
 Everyday I live for You 
 I want to get to know you more and more 
 The things I feel inside my heart 
 Can only come from knowing more of You 
 You have brought Your Love into my life 
 Now I live each day within Your light 
 Hopelessly I've fallen for You 
 Your love surrounds me everyday I live for You 
 You have brought Your freedom in my life 
 You're teaching me to shine a little light 
 In every situation You are guiding me 'cause 
 Everyday I live for You

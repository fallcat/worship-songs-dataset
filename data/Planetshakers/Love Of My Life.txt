I love the way You move 
 As You sweep across this place 
 I love the things You do 
 Jesus I love You 
 You fill the atmosphere 
 Like a cloud that's rolling in 
 You settle like the mist 
 Jesus I love You 
 I'll sing, I was made for this 
 To worship in Your courts, giving all of me 
 I love You, love You, Jesus 
 There is no other 
 I'm living to know You more and more 
 You are the love of my life 
 The current of Your love 
 Is flowing in this place 
 You're sweeping me away 
 Jesus I love You 
 I'll sing, I was made for this 
 To worship in Your courts, giving all of me 
 I love You, love You, Jesus 
 There is no other 
 I'm living to know You more and more 
 You are the love of my life 
 I don't want anything else 
 Lord I'm hungry for You, hungry for You 
 You are the one that I want 
 Lord I'm longing for You, longing for You 
 I love You, love You, Jesus 
 There is no other 
 I'm living to know You more and more 
 You are the love of my life 
 I don't want anything else 
 Lord I'm hungry for You, hungry for You 
 You are the one that I want 
 Lord I'm longing for You, longing for You 
 I don't want anything else 
 Lord I'm hungry for You, hungry for You 
 You are the one that I want 
 Lord I'm longing for You, longing for You 
 I love the way You move 
 As You sweep across this place 
 I love the things You do 
 Jesus I love You

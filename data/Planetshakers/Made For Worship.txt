I abandon, every distraction 
 My attention is set on You 
 My devotion, Jesus my portion 
 My affection is set on You 
 I was made to worship, I was made for Your embrace 
 I was made to worship, I was made to bless Your Name 
 I will bless the Lord at all times 
 I will bless the Lord at all times 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I will shout Your praise forever 
 I will shout Your praise forever 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 Captivated by Your goodness 
 Overwhelmed by Your majesty 
 Swept away in Your Holy Presence 
 Giving over all of me 
 I was made to worship, I was made for Your embrace 
 I was made to worship, I was made to bless Your Name 
 I will bless the Lord at all times 
 I will bless the Lord at all times 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I will shout Your praise forever 
 I will shout Your praise forever 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 My heart and flesh cry out 
 For You to fill me up 
 You satisfy me 
 Fill me with power and truth 
 Fill me with love from You 
 You satisfy me 
 (x2) 
 I will bless the Lord at all times 
 I will bless the Lord at all times 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I will shout Your praise forever 
 I will shout Your praise forever 
 I was made to worship 
 I was made to bless Your name 
 I was made to worship, I was made for Your embrace 
 I was made to worship, I was made to bless Your Name

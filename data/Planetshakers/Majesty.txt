Rising 
 I feel my heart sing 
 His praises 
 Our Lord and King 
 The wonder the majesty 
 Welcome the King of Glory in 
 Every tribe and tongue 
 Every land will sing Your praise 
 Till the end of time we'll sing 
 Majesty 
 All majesty 
 To the God of creation 
 All majesty 
 God of all generations 
 This anthem we sing 
 To the God of all nations 
 All majesty we sing

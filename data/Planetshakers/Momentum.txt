I can see it coming, a wave of His power 
 You won't find me running, 'cause this is the hour 
 That I am going deeper 
 To places that I've never been 
 I believe for greater 
 To see things that I've never seen 
 Our God is moving and His love is unstoppable 
 So keep the party going, no stopping 
 Caught up in momentum 
 We lift Him higher, higher, higher 
 We're gonna sing louder, louder, louder 
 I can feel it rising, a flood of His glory 
 His love is overwhelming and I know its drawing 
 So am going deeper 
 To places that I've never been 
 I believe for greater 
 To see things that I've never seen 
 Our God is moving and His love is unstoppable 
 So keep the party going, no stopping 
 Caught up in momentum 
 We lift Him higher, higher, higher 
 We're gonna sing louder, louder, louder 
 We'll never stop, no we'll never stop 
 Giving praise to You 
 We lift You up, Lord we lift You up 
 You make all things new 
 We'll never stop, no we'll never stop 
 Giving praise to You 
 We lift You up, Lord we lift You up 
 You make all things new 
 Our God is moving and His love is unstoppable 
 So keep the party going, no stopping 
 Caught up in momentum 
 We lift Him higher, higher, higher 
 We're gonna sing louder, louder, louder

Ladies tell em, did you bring your best praise 
 (Uhuh you know we did and it's all for Jesus name) 
 Now gentleman what's up, did you bring a sacrifice 
 (That's right you know we did and it's all to lift Him high) 
 This moment I'm taking 
 Without hesitation

 On how I will praise Him 
 I'm not holding back 
 Move out of my way 
 'Cause I am here to lift His name 
 And bring a sacrifice of praise 
 For He's been so good to me 
 Family say it, If God has been good 
 (He's been so good to us, Gonna praise Him like we should) 
 Whole world hear it, the sound of His praise 
 (He has the Name above, the Name above all names)

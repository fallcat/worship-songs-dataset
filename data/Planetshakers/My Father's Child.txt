I hear You call for my return 
 Love has sent for me 
 I see You run with open arms 
 My heart is undone 
 You won't withhold, You never withhold from me 
 I am my Father's child 
 I belong to the God Most High 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 For Your love is here to stay 
 Every mistake vanished in waves 
 Of Your powerful grace 
 Freedom at last, released from the past 
 My heart is undone 
 You won't withhold, You never withhold from me 
 I am my Father's child 
 I belong to the God Most High 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 For Your love is here to stay 
 I am my Father's child 
 I was bought with the highest price 
 I don't have to be ashamed 
 For Your love is here to stay 
 Always 
 Always 
 Father, You are with me 
 Father, You are for me 
 Always 
 Always 
 Father, I will worship 
 Father, I adore You 
 I am my Father's child 
 I belong to the God Most High 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 For Your love is here to stay 
 I am my Father's child 
 I was bought with the highest price 
 I don't have to be ashamed 
 For Your love is here to stay 
 For Your love is here to stay

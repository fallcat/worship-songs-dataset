Lord I give my all to You 
 Every day I'm living for Your Name 
 I don't care what comes my way 
 I'm gonna lay my life down every day 
 My life is not my own 
 Lord Jesus take control 
 I give You everything 
 You are the reason I sing 
 Take my life God every part 
 I'm reaching out to give You my heart 
 One thing I wanna let You know 
 You're my hero 
 Jesus there is none like You 
 No one else can make me feel this way 
 There is power in Your Name 
 To live a life of freedom everyday 
 You are everything to me 
 More than the air I breathe 
 You're everything I need 
 You're my hero

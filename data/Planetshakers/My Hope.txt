I lay down my life before You Lord 
 Stand here in wonder of Your Love 
 Lord I live for You alone 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 All of Heaven shouts Your Name 
 All the earth will bring You praise 
 With my life I honour You 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 You're all I want 
 You're all I need 
 My one desire 
 My hope is found in You 
 Everything I need is at Your feet 
 My life I lay it down, an offering 
 I'm living for the glory of Your Name 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 Jesus

His praises rise in my heart 
 His passion is burning deeply within 
 Could to lift to name up every day 
 And tell the world that You're the Only Way 
 Come and fill me with Your power 
 It's in You I find my Strength 
 Gonna live my life for You 
 Alone. 
 Jesus my heart is crying out for more of You 
 King of all kings, Lord of lords 
 My Life is Yours. 
 You are the Only one for me 
 And all keep singing on and on and on to You my King 
 Go to lift You in all I do 
 Jesus, You are everything to me 
 You are everything to me. 
 My life is all for You, Lord 
 Take over all of me 
 I live to worship You Alone

I gaze into Your Glorious light 
 I know You're with me day and night 
 And now I want to praise Your name 
 There's nothing else that I want more 
 Than just to look at You in awe 
 I sense Your Spirit set to move 
 I know Your love it never ends 
 I know Your power gives me strength 
 I know somehow I'll never be the same 
 It's Your grace 
 That brought me freedom to praise 
 And glorify Your Name 
 My passion is to worship You 
 It's Your love 
 A sacrifice to give eternal life 
 I praise You Lord 
 And Glorify Your name

You are the light of the world, 
 You are the only way to heaven 
 I lift up my eyes to see, 
 Your glory, Your beauty 
 You are the way and the truth, 
 Those who believe will live forever 
 I lift up my eyes to see, 
 Your glory, Your beauty 
 Heaven and earth will pass away, 
 But Your word remains forever 
 I worship You, 
 Jesus how I long for You, 
 With every breath I live for You, 
 You are all I need 
 I give You praise, 
 With all my heart and all my days, 
 I long to worship You always, 
 You are all I need 
 Let all creation, bow in worship 
 The voices of angels in one accord 
 Shout the anthem of heaven, He is risen 
 Jesus, my saviour

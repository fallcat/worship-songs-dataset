My soul longs for Jesus 
 In a dry and weary land 
 Oh come Living Water 
 Son of God and Son of man 
 He's the Light in the shadows 
 He's the lamp to my feet 
 My soul longs for Jesus 
 And He longs for me 
 My soul longs for Jesus 
 From the morning's first light 
 Where His mercies they greet me 
 Like a song in the night 
 Every hour, every moment 
 Now and forevermore 
 Let me sing unto Jesus 
 Nothing pleases me more 
 My soul longs for Jesus 
 Name above all other names 
 Let my life be ever blameless 
 Every keeping His ways 
 He's the lighthouse that leads me 
 He's my compass, my guide 
 Let my courses follow Jesus 
 By day and by night 
 My soul longs for Jesus 
 He's the Savior of sin 
 His blood washes over 
 Praise God, I'm born again 
 From the ashes He raised me 
 Death no longer has a hold 
 For I belong to Jesus 
 He paid for my soul 
 My soul longs for Jesus 
 What a glorious day 
 When the troubles of the ages 
 Shall swiftly pass away 
 With the armies of Heaven 
 He will carry us home 
 How I long for You, Jesus 
 Oh come, Jesus come

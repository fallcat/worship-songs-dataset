I once was lost but You found me and now I'm free 
 I need Your power to come and change me 
 Your Spirit lives in me 
 I wanna dance for all to see 
 What compares to Your redeeming Love 
 What can separate me from Your Love 
 I need You in my life 
 I'm never letting go 
 Of all the things You've said 
 I'm holding on 'cause You promised me that 
 You'd never leave 
 You're always by my side 
 You'll never let me go 
 So I'm holding on 'cause I know that I need You

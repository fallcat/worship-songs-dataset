You pick me up when I am down and on my own 
 You hold my hand and lead on in to Your plans 
 Whenever I cry out You hear me 
 Whenever I fall down You hold me 
 Hold me, never let me go 
 Change me I want the world to know 
 You are living in me 
 God I know You'll never let me go 
 No, You'll never let me go 
 No, You'll never let me go 
 No, You'll never let me go 
 I want to live for You, 
 My God You are my all 
 God help me stand for You each day 
 And be Your voice 
 Whenever I cry out You hear me 
 Whenever I fall down You hold me 
 Whenever I stand up You're with me

All my hopes and all my dreams 
 God I lay them at Your feet 
 Cause all I want is You 
 All I have and all I am 
 I surrender every part of me 
 Cause all I want is You 
 Take my life 
 Take my everything 
 Take my heart 
 Take every part of me 
 God I give my heart, my life to You 
 And I'll never stop, never stop, giving it all to You 
 All I have is Yours 
 And all I am is Yours

I've made up my mind 
 No compromise 
 I will live for You 
 Because of the Cross 
 And what it cost 
 I will go for You 
 Shout His name out! 
 (Jesus!) 
 Shout His name out! 
 (Jesus!) 
 Whoa! 
 I am not ashamed of You 
 Whoa! 
 I'm singin' it loud 
 Whoa! 
 I am living for You now 
 No matter what it costs I'll go 
 This praise is rising in my soul 
 I can't contain it any more 
 I just have to dance!

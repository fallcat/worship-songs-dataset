My heart longs 
 For Your Love 
 My soul thirsts 
 For Your touch 
 There is no one like You God 
 There is none like You 
 There is no one else like You 
 There is no one beside You 
 There is no one else like You 
 My God, my King 
 No one else 
 Nothing compares to You my God 
 No one could ever take Your Love away 
 You're my King, my everything 
 Jesus

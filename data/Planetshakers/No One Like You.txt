Who can match You marvelous word, Oh Lord 
 Who can match the things that You do 
 Who can match the beauty inside of You 
 What compares to the power 
 That comes from You 
 What compares to the love 
 That You give 
 What compares to the glory 
 That falls from You 
 Higher and higher we lift Your name 
 Higher than everything 
 There is no one like You 
 No one like you, Lord 
 You are so holy 
 You are strong and mighty 
 Full of glory and majesty 
 What compares to the power 
 That comes from You 
 What compares to the love 
 That You give 
 What compares to the glory 
 That falls from You 
 Higher and higher we lift Your name 
 Higher than everything 
 There is no one like You 
 No one like you, Lord 
 You are so holy 
 You are strong and mighty 
 Full of glory and majesty 
 Full of glory and majesty 
 There's no one like You, Jesus 
 There's no one like You Lord 
 Who can compare to You 
 You're so full of power 
 Full of glory, full of honor 
 You are holy 
 With all of heaven we sing Holy 
 For there is nothing like Your glory 
 Let all creation arise and sing to the King 
 There is no one like You 
 No one like you, Lord 
 You are so holy 
 You are strong and mighty 
 Full of glory and majesty 
 You are holy 
 With all of heaven we sing Holy 
 For there is nothing like Your glory 
 Let all creation arise and sing to the King 
 Let all creation arise and sing to the King

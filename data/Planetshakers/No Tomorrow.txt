I was lost until You found me 
 You came and rescued me 
 The day You set me free 
 I was looking for something 
 I will follow You 
 Everyday I'm running after You 
 I want to tell You how I feel 
 I never felt this way before 
 You make me wanna dance like 
 There's no tomorrow 
 After all the things You've done for me 
 I've got to tell You now 
 You make me wanna shout 
 Like there's no tomorrow 
 Now I'm found 
 Your grace has saved me 
 I give my life to You 
 Nothing else I'd rather do 
 'Cause I'm living it for You 
 I've got to tell You 
 What I'm feeling 
 I've got to shout 
 And praise Your name 
 I've got to tell You 
 What I'm feeling 
 I've got to shout 
 Like there's no tomorrow 
 Like there's no tomorrow

When I feel distant 
 Your love draws me close 
 When my hope is missing 
 Your presence is my home 
 You're my protector 
 Your word keeps me safe 
 The love of my Father 
 Nothing can separate 
 No matter where I've been or what I've done 
 You'll never leave or hold back Your love 
 Your presence is surrounding me 
 I am not alone 
 You are here with me 
 You've given me Your heart 
 And You will never leave 
 Father, You're always good 
 And You're always here for me 
 You'll never leave 
 When I feel broken 
 You show me what it cost 
 To win back my freedom 
 My Saviour on the cross 
 No matter where I've been or what I've done 
 You'll never leave or hold back Your love 
 Your presence is surrounding me 
 I am not alone 
 You are here with me 
 You've given me Your heart 
 And You will never leave 
 Father, You're always good 
 And You're always here for me 
 You'll never leave 
 For all of my days 
 Your love wraps around me 
 Love wraps around my heart 
 And I am safe 
 I'll worship forever 
 Worship with all my heart 
 For all of my days 
 Your love wraps around me 
 Love wraps around my heart 
 And I am safe 
 I'll worship forever 
 Worship with all my heart 
 I am not alone 
 You are here with me 
 You've given me Your heart 
 And You will never leave 
 Father, You're always good 
 And You're always here for me 
 You'll never leave 
 You'll never leave 
 You'll never leave 
 You'll never leave 
 You'll never leave 
 For all of my days 
 Your love wraps around me 
 Love wraps around my heart 
 And I am safe 
 I'll worship forever 
 Worship with all my heart 
 For all of my days 
 Your love wraps around me 
 Love wraps around my heart

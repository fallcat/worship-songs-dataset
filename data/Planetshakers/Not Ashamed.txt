Ba dup ba ba bow x4 
 Jesus, I'll stand 
 In every circumstance 
 I'll lift up Your name 
 To save this generation 
 Ba dup ba ba bow 
 Sometimes, It's hard 
 To know exactly what to say 
 But I will, stand up 
 'Cause You are with me all the way 
 Gonna Let it show, let the whole world know 
 What You've done in me 
 'Cause I am not ashamed 
 I will be a light, in the darkest night 
 Everyone will see 
 'Cause I am not ashamed (No) 
 I am not ashamed (No) 
 I am not ashamed 
 I am not ashamed, of the gospel of Your name 
 I am not ashamed

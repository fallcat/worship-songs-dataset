Through You, 
 I can do anything, 
 I can do all things, 
 For it's You who give me strength, 
 Nothing is impossible 
 Through You, 
 Blind eyes are opened, 
 Strongholds are broken, 
 I am living by faith, 
 Nothing is impossible! 
 I'm not gonna live by what I see, 
 I'm not gonna live by what I feel 
 Deep down I, 
 Know that You're here with me 
 I know that, You can do anything 
 I believe, I believe, 
 I believe, I believe in You

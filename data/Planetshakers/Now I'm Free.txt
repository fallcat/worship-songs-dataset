You have taken away all my pain 
 You have taken away all my shame 
 You have called me Your own, and made me new 
 Love has flooded my soul, and made me sing 
 You have taken control of all my sin 
 You have given it all, and now I'm free 
 For it's only by Your grace 
 We are saved, we are changed 
 For it's only by Your love 
 We are free 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 You have risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 You have come to show the way 
 And the world won't stop us moving forward 
 Living for Your name 
 Hallelujah 
 You have taken away all my pain 
 You have taken away all my shame 
 You have called me Your own, and made me new 
 For it's only by Your grace 
 We are saved, we are changed 
 For it's only by Your love 
 We are free 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 You have risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 You have come to show the way 
 And the world won't stop us moving forward 
 Living for Your name 
 Hallelujah 
 Your love is bigger than the galaxy 
 Your love is deeper than the deepest sea 
 Your love is why I'm here giving You praise 
 (X4) 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 You have risen from the grave 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 You have come to show the way 
 And the world won't stop us moving forward 
 Living for Your name 
 Hallelujah

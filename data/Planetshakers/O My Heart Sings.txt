So much to be thankful for 
 So much to be thankful for 
 Where would I start 
 Many gifts to thank You for 
 Many blessings You've restored 
 Where would I start 
 Grace abounding, mercy shining 
 Waking up the dawn with light 
 Love that covers, grace that orders 
 This is what my heart will say 
 O my heart sings 
 O my heart sings 
 O my heart sings praise 
 Let everything that has breath 
 Everything that has breath 
 Praise the Lord

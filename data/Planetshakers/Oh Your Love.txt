Hope and grace collide, a brand new life, 
 Your love changes everything 
 Into the dark of night, You shine Your light, 
 Your love changes everything 
 Your favour and love go before me 
 So I've got no reason to fear 
 On my right and my left You surround me 
 So take me now I'm drawing near 
 Oh Your love it makes me wanna shout 
 This praise inside my heart is breaking out 
 You give me all Your love 
 And I can't get enough 
 I give You all my love 
 I'm never gonna stop, 
 Oh, it makes me wanna shout 
 Every doubt erased, by Your embrace, 
 Your love is my everything 
 No longer bound by sin, but taken in, 
 Your love is my everything 
 Your favour and love go before me 
 So I've got no reason to fear 
 On my right and my left You surround me 
 So take me now I'm drawing near 
 Oh Your love, it makes me wanna shout 
 This praise inside my heart is breaking out 
 You give me all Your love 
 And I can't get enough 
 I give You all my love 
 I'm never gonna stop, 
 Oh, it makes me wanna shout 
 Dance, dance, everybody clap your hands, hands 
 For you know our God is victorious 
 Breaking every chain with His love for us 
 Oh, it makes me wanna shout 
 (x2) 
 Oh Your love, it makes me wanna shout 
 This praise inside my heart is breaking out 
 You give me all Your love 
 And I can't get enough 
 I give You all my love 
 I'm never gonna stop, 
 Oh, it makes me wanna shout

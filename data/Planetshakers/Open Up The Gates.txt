We come into this Holy place 
 To bring a sacrifice of praise 
 Bow down before you and seek your face 
 We sing of the mighty things you've done 
 Cry out to you 
 "Let your will be done" 
 Tell all the World you're the Holy One 
 Hear the shouts of praise 
 As they're rising up to you 
 Come and fill this place 
 As we bring glory to your name 
 Open up the gates and let the 
 King of glory in 
 Fill this house with praises as we 
 Lift our hands and worship you 
 Open up the doors and let your 
 Glory fill the earth 
 King of heaven we dance before your throne 
 King of heaven come and 
 Take your place 
 Dwell among us as we 
 Seek your face

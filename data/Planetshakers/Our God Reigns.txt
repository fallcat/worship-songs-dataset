Oh for the joy before Him, our Saviour 
 Went to the cross to purchase our freedom 
 Trading its shame for glory, Jesus reigns 
 Death could not hold Him down, my Saviour 
 Sin and the grave forever defeated 
 Victory's mine forever, Jesus reigns 
 Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns over all things 
 He is the Great I Am, the risen Son of man 
 Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns over all things 
 He is our victory, the One who set us free 
 The power of the cross has spoken, my sins are 
 Washed in His blood, now heaven is open 
 Redemption is mine forever, Jesus reigns 
 Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns over all things 
 He is the Great I Am, the risen Son of man 
 Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns over all things 
 He is our victory, the One who set us free 
 All authority, power and majesty 
 Our God, our God reigns 
 All authority, power and majesty 
 Our God, our God reigns 
 All authority, power and majesty 
 Our God, our God reigns 
 All authority, power and majesty 
 Our God, our God reigns 
 Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns over all things 
 He is the Great I Am, the risen Son of man 
 Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns over all things 
 He is our victory, the One who set us free 
 All authority, power and majesty 
 Our God, our God reigns 
 All authority, power and majesty 
 Our God, our God reigns

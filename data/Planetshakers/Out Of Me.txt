I've been quiet for way too long 
 It's time to make a sound 
 It's time to let it all out 
 In my heart is a rising song 
 A song of victory 
 Of all You've done for me 
 What can I say You blow me away 
 Throwing off restraint 
 I'll praise You recklessly 
 'Cause I want the world to see 
 I want the world to see Your glory 
 Fill me up so much that You 
 Bust out of me 
 'Cause I want the world to see 
 I want the world to see Your glory

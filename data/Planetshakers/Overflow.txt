Our faith is breaking through the ceiling 
 There's no doubt we are believing 
 That in this moment we are seeing 
 Everything that we've been dreaming 
 Cause' you go beyond what we desire 
 You're reaching higher, greater than all 
 You're never ending, and you overflow 
 Now to him all glory and power 
 We sing our praise 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over again 
 There's no limit to your power 
 Lord we know that you are greater 
 In every season you are stronger 
 Showing how your love is deeper 
 And you go beyond what we desire 
 You're reaching higher, greater than all 
 You're never ending and you overflow 
 Now to him all glory and power 
 We sing our praise 
 Over and over again 
 Over and over again 
 If you love him don't stop singing 
 Everybody keep on praising 
 If you love him don't stop singing 
 Everybody keep on praising 
 Here we are with hands raised to the sky 
 Cause' you alone are all that we desire 
 We are ready hearts are open wide 
 Overflow us saturate our lives 
 If you love him don't stop singing 
 Everybody keep on praising 
 If you love him don't stop singing 
 Everybody keep on praising

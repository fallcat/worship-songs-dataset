This passion deep within my soul 
 I'm letting go 
 I'm letting go 
 I won't hold it back no more 
 I'm giving all 
 I'm giving all 
 'Cause You've been so good 
 You gave up Your life for me 
 I praise You like I should 
 I give You all of me 
 I give You all of me 
 I give You all of me 
 Every breath I breathe for You 
 No holding back 
 No holding back 
 With my life, I will respond 
 To Your call 
 I'm giving all 
 'Cause You've been so good 
 You gave up Your life for me 
 I praise You like I should 
 I give You all of me 
 I give You all of me 
 I give You all of me 
 You have it 
 My passion 
 My praises 
 Always 
 I give You 
 My passion 
 My praises 
 Always 
 I give You all of me 
 I give You all of me 
 I give You all of me 
 You have it 
 My passion 
 My praises 
 Always 
 I give You 
 My passion 
 My praises 
 Always

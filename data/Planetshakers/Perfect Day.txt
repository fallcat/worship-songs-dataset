Looking back over my life 
 I can see some changes 
 That You alone have brought 
 Everything became so clear 
 From the moment 
 That You came in my life 
 Was as if I saw for the first time 
 And suddenly I felt like I could breathe 
 What a perfect day 
 What a perfect day 
 What a perfect day when You came into my life 
 Jesus 
 I'm in love with You

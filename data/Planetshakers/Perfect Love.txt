You are at home in my heart 
 'Cause You loved me right from the start 
 When I was refusing 
 Your love kept pursuing 
 Now that I've tasted Your love 
 My heart just can't get enough 
 Jesus You have me 
 You have me completely 
 It's Your love in my heart running over 
 Everyday of my life I'll draw closer 
 Such a perfect love 
 Oh, You lift me higher 
 Lighting up my way 
 Everything is brighter 
 With You everything is better 
 With You I am right where I belong 
 In this perfect love 
 No matter what I go through 
 I'll keep my eyes fixed on You 
 Jesus You're faithful 
 And You are able 
 It's Your love in my heart running over 
 Everyday of my life I'll draw closer 
 Such a perfect love 
 Oh, You lift me higher 
 Lighting up my way 
 Everything is brighter 
 With You everything is better 
 With You I am right where I belong 
 In this perfect love 
 Every part of my heart is now open 
 Make Your home in my heart 
 You are welcome 
 Such a perfect love 
 Oh, You lift me higher 
 Lighting up my way 
 Everything is brighter 
 With You everything is better 
 With You I am right where I belong 
 In this perfect love

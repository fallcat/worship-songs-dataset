I searched the sky for something, 
 That I can't see, 
 What lies beyond the naked eye, captivates me... 
 The truth is there, there's no denying in, 
 It lies beyond the realms of where we live... 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a peculiar intervention of the very hand of God 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's an invisible encounter with the very hand of God 
 Somethings we can't explain now, 
 Natures free... 
 Is it coincidence or conspiracy? 
 The truth is there there's no denying in, 
 It lies beyond the realms of where we live... 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a peculiar intervention of the very hand of God 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's an invisible encounter with the very hand of God 
 The truth is there, there's no denying in, 
 It lies beyond the realms of where we live... 
 Eyeaeyeah... yeah... 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a peculiar intervention of the very hand of God 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's an invisible encounter with the very hand of God 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena 
 It's a phenomena of GOD!

I was blind but now I see 
 Love has got a hold on me 
 Now I sing 'cause I am free 
 So I'm laying down my life 
 And I'm taking up my cross 
 I'm taking up my cross 
 Laying down my life 
 All for the glory of Your name 
 I'm living my whole life 
 All for You Jesus 
 Taking up my cross everyday 
 I was lost 
 Now I'm found 
 Put my feet on solid ground 
 Now I sing 'cause I am free 
 I choose to stand for my generation

Looking out of my window 
 I see the trees blowing in the breeze 
 Looking out of my window 
 I see the birds flying in the sky 
 I know 
 With just one breath 
 You created the whole earth 
 I know 
 If I don't praise You 
 The rocks will soon cry out, cry out, cry out... 
 Praise Him 
 Lift your voices 
 Let it ring 
 Throughout all the earth 
 Praise Him 
 Let all men know Jesus is alive!

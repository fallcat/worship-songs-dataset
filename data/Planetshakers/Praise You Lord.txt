Whoa, the King broke chains off me 
 Your love has set me free 
 Now all I can do is dance 
 Whoa, the walls came crashing down 
 With one word from Your mouth 
 Now all I can do is dance 
 We are redeemed, set free forgiven 
 We are the chosen, we are the living 
 We are redeemed, set free forgiven 
 So if you love Him, sing, sing! 
 Oh! Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord 
 For You are good, You are good 
 Forever we will dance and sing 
 For You are good, You are good 
 You are good 
 Whoa, Your love has rescued me 
 I live in victory 
 Now all I can do is dance 
 We are redeemed, set free forgiven 
 We are the chosen, we are the living 
 We are redeemed, set free forgiven 
 So if you love Him, sing, sing! 
 Oh! Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord 
 For You are good, You are good 
 Forever we will dance and sing 
 For You are good, You are good 
 Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord 
 For You are good, You are good 
 Forever we will dance and sing 
 For You are good, You are good 
 You are good 
 Whom the Son sets free is free indeed 
 Whom the Son sets free has liberty 
 Your love has taken chains off me 
 (x3) 
 Oh! Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord 
 For You are good, You are good 
 Forever we will dance and sing 
 For You are good, You are good 
 Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord 
 For You are good, You are good 
 Forever we will dance and sing 
 For You are good, You are good 
 You are good 
 You are good

I will praise you 
 Name above every name 
 'Cause I'm trusting 
 In your word everyday 
 It don't matter 
 Even what people say 
 'Cause I'm walking 
 In my promise today 
 Even when I'm scared 
 When I'm in the lowest valley 
 I know that you are always there 
 And I will praise you 
 I will sing your praise forever 
 I will sing, I will praise you 
 I will shout your name forever 
 I will sing, I will praise you 
 O praise him 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 Praise him 
 All the earth 
 Praise him

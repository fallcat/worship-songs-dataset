Breaking off every chain 
 And the fear that held me 
 I refuse to agree 
 With the lies they told me 
 I take up my position 
 Speak to all my conditions 
 Take the authority 
 You've won for me 
 The word of the Lord in my mouth 
 To bring about the change 
 Full of Your power, I step out 
 Declare aloud Your praise 
 I prophesy 
 I prophesy 
 I prophesy 
 I'm stepping out to become 
 Everything You've called me 
 I believe in Your word 
 And Your Spirit in me 
 I take up my position 
 Speak to all my conditions 
 Take the authority 
 You've won for me 
 The word of the Lord in my mouth 
 To bring about the change 
 Full of Your power, I step out 
 Declare aloud Your praise 
 I prophesy 
 I prophesy 
 I prophesy 
 I'll praise You 
 Like I've never known defeat 
 I'll praise You 
 Every second You've redeemed 
 I'll praise You 
 Your power rests on me, yeah 
 I'll praise You 
 Now for every victory 
 I'll praise You 
 'Cause Your Spirit lives in me 
 I'll praise You 
 Your power rests on me 
 The word of the Lord in my mouth 
 To bring about the change 
 Full of Your power, I step out 
 Declare aloud Your praise 
 I prophesy 
 I prophesy 
 I prophesy 
 I prophesy

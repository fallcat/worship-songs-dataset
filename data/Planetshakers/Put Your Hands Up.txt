I've gotta let You know that I'm so thankful 
 For everything You have done 
 The way You lifted me, and turned my life around 
 Now in You I am found 
 So put your hands up, everybody give Him glory 
 Hands up 
 Everybody shout your praise aloud 
 And sing with everything 
 Give Him all the glory, for our God is worthy 
 Whoa

I am falling to my knees 
 I need You Lord to breathe in me 
 My prayer is still the same 
 My heart is calling out Your name 
 Sweet anointing fill this place 
 I am found in Your embrace 
 Rain down on me 
 Rain down on me 
 Here in Your presence I am free 
 Pour down like rain 
 Come and touch me again 
 Lord let Your presence fall on me 
 I'm longing just to see 
 Your power and Your majesty 
 Sweet anointing fill this place 
 I am found in Your embrace 
 Sweet anointing 
 Wash me over 
 Sweet anointing 
 Wash me over

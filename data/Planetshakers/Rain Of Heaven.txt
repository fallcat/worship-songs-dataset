Let the rain of Heaven 
 Be porued out in this place 
 Let the earth be flooded 
 With Your mercy and Your grace 
 Open up the Heavens in this place 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 Lord our hearts are thirsty 
 Our passion is renewed 
 Longing for the waters 
 That only come from You 
 Open up the Heavens in this place 
 Let it rain, let it rain 
 'Cause I am thirsty for the waters 
 That only come from You 
 Flowing from the mighty river 
 That flows out from Your throne 
 Come now, O Holy Spirit 
 Rain down, rain down 
 Thirsty for a touch from Heaven 
 Rain down on us 
 Here we are waiting 
 With one heart 
 One mind, and one accord 
 Let the fire from Heaven 
 Fall on us now 
 With power to overcome

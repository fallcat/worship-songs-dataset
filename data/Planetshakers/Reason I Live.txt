I was no one 
 When I first met You 
 I had nothing of worth in my life 
 Then I found You 
 And it all became clear 
 You're the one that I've been searching for 
 From the start 
 I couldn't figure it out 
 Why someone like You would die for me 
 But I know that Your love for me is so great 
 And that is why I'm giving You my life 
 I am Yours 
 Every part of me 
 Jesus You're the reason I live 
 Take my life Lord 
 Use me as You will 
 Jesus You're the reason I live 
 Can't believe that 
 You're with me till forever 
 I'll never leave You and You'll never leave me 
 That's what I long for 
 Your here presence in my life 
 You're the air 
 You're the reason why 
 You're the reason I 
 You're the reason I live

My Jesus is better 
 Than anything in this world 
 He loves me, I love Him 
 So I give Him everything 
 He gave His life for me 
 My Saviour 
 Is living in me 
 Redeemer 
 JESUS He set me free 
 He's living in my heart 
 He gave me a new start 
 I asked Him, He came in 
 And washed away all my sin 
 He gave His life for me 
 He died to set me free 
 If You can use anything 
 Won't You use me 
 Take me and break me and 
 Mould me and make me 
 You died for me 
 So I'm living for You 
 I'm living for You 
 I'm living for You 
 Whoa! 
 Jesus He set me free

Since I've found your love 
 I've never needed anything to fill my heart 
 Even when I fall 
 You're always there with open arms to pick me up 
 From the start I knew 
 No one else could make me feel the way you do 
 Everyday I want to grow 
 Just a little bit closer, just a little bit closer 
 I want to be a reflector 
 I want to shine with your glory 
 I want to let the whole world know that you're 
 Living in me 
 I want to burn with your fire 
 Shine my light a little brighter 
 I want to let the whole world know that 
 Jesus Lives in me

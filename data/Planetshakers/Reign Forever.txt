No mountain too high 
 No valley too low 
 That You cannot overcome 
 No problem too great 
 No need that You cannot fulfill 
 Because of your power 
 Saviour, Healer, Redeemer 
 Creator, giver of life to all things 
 I stand in awe of You, 
 I stand in owe of your wonder and grace 
 I stand in awe of You, 
 My God, You reign forever 
 Jesus, King of kings 
 Jesus, Lord of lords 
 Jesus, King of kings 
 And You reign forevermore

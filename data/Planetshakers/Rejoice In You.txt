Today is the day You've made 
 I will sing for joy 
 And I will be glad in it 
 You are the reason 
 I am singing now 
 You are the reason why I'm here 
 You are the reason 
 I am free indeed 
 You are the reason why I live 
 All I am is for You 
 All I have is for You 
 All my life is for You 
 Everything is for You 
 Today is the day You've made 
 I will sing for joy 
 And I will be glad in it 
 Today Your promises are true 
 Your mercies are renewed 
 So I will rejoice in You

When I'm alone the world is such a different place 
 Sometimes it's hard to keep the smile upon my face 
 It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down 
 It's taken so long but now there's one thing that I've found 
 When everything starts crashing down 
 When all I know falls to the ground 
 When darkness comes and I can't see 
 You're always there to rescue me. 
 Just when I think that I have got it figured out 
 You open my eyes and let me see that there's no doubt 
 But you've got it all within the power of your hand 
 It seems like the more I know the less I understand 
 When everything starts crashing down 
 When all I know falls to the ground 
 When darkness comes and I can't see 
 You're always there to rescue me. 
 When all my strength has turned to fear 
 When I wonder if you're near 
 When I don't know how to break free 
 You're always there to rescue me. 
 I wonder if I'll make it through this darkest night 
 I need to know your strength in me go in this fight 
 I'm reaching out - won't you take my hand; show me to the light? 
 I know you're by my side. 
 It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down 
 It's taken so long but now there's one thing that I've found 
 When everything starts crashing down 
 When all I know falls to the ground 
 When darkness comes and I can't see 
 You're always there to rescue me 
 When all my strength has turned to fear 
 When I wonder if you're near 
 When I don't know how to break free 
 You're always there to rescue me. 
 You're always there to rescue me 
 You're always there to rescue me 
 You're always there to rescue me 
 You're always there to rescue me

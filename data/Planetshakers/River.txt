Whatever comes, whatever goes 
 There is one thing that I know 
 You are faithful, You are faithful 
 So I speak out Your word 
 It has the power to change my world 
 You're my breakthrough, You're my breakthrough 
 I will trust You, I will trust You 
 You are a never ending river, flowing full of power 
 Washing over me 
 I will run into the water, Jesus take me deeper 
 Saturating me 
 In the midst of despair 
 You are God and You are there 
 You're always with me, You're always with me 
 I will trust You, I will trust You 
 You are a never ending river, flowing full of power 
 Washing over me 
 I will run into the water, Jesus take me deeper 
 Saturating me 
 I don't care what it looks like, I'm diving in 
 Nothing will stop this passion, I'm praising Him 
 I don't care what it looks like, I'm diving in 
 Nothing will stop this passion, I'm praising Him 
 You are a never ending river, flowing full of power 
 Washing over me 
 I will run into the water, Jesus take me deeper 
 Saturating me 
 I don't care what it looks like, I'm diving in 
 Nothing will stop this passion, I'm praising Him 
 I don't care what it looks like, I'm diving in 
 Nothing will stop this passion, I'm praising Him

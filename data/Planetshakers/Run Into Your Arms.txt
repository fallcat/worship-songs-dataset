Where could I go that I could 
 Hide myself from You 
 Where could I run that You won't 
 Be there waiting for me 
 Closer to You I find my heart is drawing near 
 And I need Your love 
 And I need Your touch 
 I will run into Your arms 
 And I will fall into Your mercy 
 I will sing forevermore 
 You're calling me to come to You 
 Gonna run into Your arms 
 Like a father with his child 
 Won't You show me now Your saving Grace 
 Yes Your saving Grace 
 Lord I want to be with You 
 Come and show me now Your endless love 
 As I reach for You

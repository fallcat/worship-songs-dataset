Your Word is a light unto my path 
 Your Love guides me through my darkest night 
 And even though sometimes Your ways 
 I cannot understand 
 I'll never walk away because my future's 
 In Your hands 
 I don't care what people will say 
 I'm running after You 
 I won't turn back and go their way 
 'Cause I'm running after You 
 Yeah I'm running after You 
 I'm running after You 
 (I will run to You) 
 I don't care what people will say 
 I'm running after You 
 I won't turn back and go their way 
 'Cause I'm running after You 
 Don't matter what may come my way 
 I'm running after you 
 It's You I'm following today 
 I'm running after You 
 I'm running after You

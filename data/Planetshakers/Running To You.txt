I am running, running to You 
 You are my hearts desire 
 I am searching, searching for You 
 Jesus I long for Your love 
 Lord You are so beautiful 
 Lord You are so wonderful 
 All I want is You Jesus 
 No one satisfies me like You 
 All I want is You Jesus 
 No one loves me like You do 
 I will worship You forever 
 Here in Your Presence 
 Here in Your glory 
 I will run to You my Savior 
 Jesus it's You, Jesus it's You

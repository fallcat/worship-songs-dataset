Save our nation Lord 
 There's nothing we want more 
 This land of hopes and dreams 
 Lord bring us to our knees 
 Hear our cry oh Lord it's time 
 Heal this land Lord send Your fire 
 Save Australia 
 Pour Your Spirit out 
 On this nation 
 Send revival to this land 
 Do it through us 
 Do it in me 
 Bless this sun burnt land 
 With Your mighty hand 
 Take our hearts and lives 
 So all may know Your Love 
 Save our nation

We're living for a God who saved us 
 A destiny, a hope that's found in truth 
 You walked before my fears and failures 
 My heart cries out, this life I give to You 
 This life I live for You 
 All my praise goes to the One 
 Who made a way, who saved the day 
 My God He made a way 
 My God he saved the day 
 Forever we will shout Your praise 
 This world will fade away 
 But Your word remains forever 
 Jesus we will shout Your praise 
 We shout Your praise 
 God of all ages 
 My life is found in You

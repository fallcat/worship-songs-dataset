I'm holding on to You 
 I'm never letting go 
 'Cause You have saved my soul 
 And You have made me whole 
 You took my brokenness 
 And filled me with Your joy 
 All I long to do is worship 
 All I long to do is bring You praise 
 For nothing compares to you 
 My Saving Grace 
 Jesus Saviour 
 My life belongs to you forever 
 'Cause you have set my heart on fire 
 And You have set me free

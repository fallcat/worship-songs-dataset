It's time for you and I to stand, 
 To march into our promised land, 
 To walk in faith and not by what I see... 
 His favour rests upon us now, 
 We're clothed in righteousness and power, 
 It's time for us to shout the victory... 
 Lift your eyes to see Him, 
 Clothed in majesty, 
 Great and powerful is He... 
 Jesus He conquered the grave, 
 Jesus the lamb that was slain, 
 Jesus the Saviour of the world... 
 Jesus He overcame sin, 
 Jesus He's coming again, 
 Jesus the Saviour of the world... 
 Jesus... Jesus... Jesus The Saviour of the World 
 Jesus... Jesus... Jesus The Saviour of the World

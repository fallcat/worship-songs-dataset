In the secret place 
 I find you 
 In Your sweet embrace 
 In the stillness Lord 
 I'm waiting 
 Here to hear Your voice 
 Calling me, drawing me 
 Jesus You're all I need 
 You are all I need my Jesus 
 You're my everything 
 You are all I need my Jesus 
 You're my everything 
 You are all I ever wanted 
 All I ever need my Jesus 
 Take me to the secret place Lord 
 You're all I need 
 Into the secret place 
 Just one moment here with You 
 Means more than anything to me

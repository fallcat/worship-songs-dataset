I remember when, I fell in love with You, 
 And I remember when, You came and made me new, 
 And I will always stay, here in Your presence everyday. 
 Ever since the day, You came into my heart, 
 It's so clear to me, that You love me from the start, 
 So I will live for You, shine in a light that burns so true... 
 I wanna see You! 
 Open up my eyes, let me see the glory of Your face, 
 Living everyday, just to see You. 
 Staring at the sun, telling everyone about the way, living everyday, 
 Just to see You 
 Ever since the day, You came into my heart, 
 It's so clear to me, that You love me from the start, 
 So I will live for You, shine in a light that burns so true. 
 I wanna see You 
 I wanna see You 
 Where would I be without Your love? 
 Where would I be without Your love?

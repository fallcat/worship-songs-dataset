Send me I will go 
 Send me I will 
 To this city, to this nation 
 And to the nations of the world 
 Send me I will go 
 Send me I will go 
 I will proclaim the truth 
 That Jesus Christ is Lord 
 I stand before you pleading from my heart 
 That by your spirit you would set me apart 
 To bring good news and liberty 
 To see this nation on its knees 
 I cry out for every family 
 You'd open blind eyes and set people free 
 That as a nation we would turn back to you 
 And see revivel sweep this land 
 As we humble ourselves 
 And seek your face 
 Fall on our knees 
 Turn from our ways 
 You will hear our cry 
 Wipe our sins away 
 Come and heal our land we pray

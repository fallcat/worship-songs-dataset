Lord we desire to see Your kingdom come 
 To see the glory of Your Son 
 Shining bright on everyone 
 All we desire is Your eternal flame 
 Burning brighter than the sun 
 Bringing hope to everyone 
 For my generation Lord 
 I am crying out for more 
 Come and fill me with Your fire 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 I want Your fire 
 More of Your power 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 I want to know Your fire again 
 All we desire is Your eternal flame 
 Burning brighter than the sun 
 Bringing hope to everyone 
 For my generation Lord 
 I am crying out for more 
 Come and fill me with Your fire 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 I want Your fire 
 More of Your power 
 Set me ablaze, set me ablaze 
 I want to know Your fire again 
 Pour out Your Spirit 
 More of Your Presence 
 Fill me again, fill me again 
 I want to know Your fire within 
 Fill me up, fill me up 
 Till I'm overflowing 
 Fill me up, fill me up 
 Till I'm running over 
 Fill me up, fill me up 
 Till I'm overflowing 
 Overflowing

 Fill me again, fill me again 
 I want to know Your fire within 
 Fill me up, fill me up 
 Till I'm overflowing 
 Fill me up, fill me up 
 Till I'm running over 
 Fill me up, fill me up 
 Till I'm overflowing 
 Overflowing

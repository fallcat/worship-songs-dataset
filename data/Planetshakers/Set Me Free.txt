Your love covers my sin 
 And washes over me 
 Your grace it draws me in 
 So I can live for You 
 Jesus You died for me 
 So I will live for You my God 
 I will lay down my life 
 For the cause of the Cross 
 And I won't try to ignore 
 That Your heart's cry is the lost 
 And I will go if You say go 
 And I will never give up 
 I will lay down my life 
 Because You laid down Your life 
 To set me free 
 Your love washes over 
 Over, over and over

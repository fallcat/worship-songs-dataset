The Holy Spirit's got me pumpin' 
 Flowing with the beat this whole place is jumpin' 
 To the sound the demons can't stand it 
 Cause tonight we're going to shake this planet 
 We're gonna shake this planet 
 And turn it upside down 
 We're gonna praise Him where His presence can be found 
 We're gonna shout His praises 
 Foe He's the one who reigns 
 We're gonna sing it till the whole world has been saved 
 Shake this planet turn it upside down 
 With your Spirit come and make a sound 
 Save this generation going down 
 Fill us cause tonight we're going to shake this planet

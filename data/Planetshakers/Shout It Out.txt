I'm gonna raise my hands 
 Gonna shout it out 
 Gonna tell the world 
 What He's all about 
 I'm gonna raise my voice 
 Gonna shout it loud 
 That the King is here 
 He's moving right now 
 C'mon get up 
 The King is here 
 There's something happening 
 In the atmosphere 
 Jump up! Jump up! 
 Jump up and shout it out 
 The King is here 
 Go tell the world about 
 His Love, His Grace 
 Spread the word around 
 Jump up! Jump up! 
 Jump up and shout it out 
 Australia, Australia 
 Australia's on fire 
 We don't need the devil 
 'Cause the devil is a liar

Nations come 
 And stand in awe 
 At the wonder of Your Name 
 The whole earth sings 
 The oceans roar 
 To the glory of Your Name 
 Lift our praise to You 
 For all eternity 
 Lift our hands to You 
 Forever shout Your Name 
 Glory to Your Name 
 Forever we will shout Your praise 
 Your majesty 
 Heaven sings Your praise 
 The wonder of Your majesty 
 Forever shout Your Name 
 Forever shout Your Name 
 We cry Holy 
 We cry Holy 
 We cry Holy 
 Forever we will sing

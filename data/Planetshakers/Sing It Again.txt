Let it begin, our freedom celebration 
 We'll dance and sing 
 There's a Holy Ghost party that never stops 
 Arise, in Your praise my soul delights 
 Shine, my dance anthem is Your love 
 Sing it again, our God reigns 
 We lift our praise unto Your name again 
 All 'round the world we'll sing 
 Sing it again, our God reigns 
 He taught our dead hearts how to beat again 
 All 'round the world we'll sing 
 Around the world, join in the celebration 
 Let it be heard 
 There's a Holy Ghost party that never stops 
 Arise, in Your praise my soul delights 
 Shine, my dance anthem is Your love 
 Sing it again, our God reigns 
 We lift our praise unto Your name again 
 All 'round the world we'll sing 
 Sing it again, our God reigns 
 He taught our dead hearts how to beat again 
 All 'round the world we'll sing

 Every heart and generation 
 Sing let it begin, let it begin 
 Every tribe and nation

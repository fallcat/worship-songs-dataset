I love who I've become in You 
 You've changed me from deep within 
 Without You I can't live 
 I need the touch of Your strong hand 
 I only live and breathe in You 
 Because of You I've been made whole 
 Without You I can't live 
 I need the touch of Your strong hand 
 And I will sing of Your love 
 And Your mercy forever 
 Reaching down from above 
 With a plan for my future 
 I'll forever proclaim 
 All the goodness and power of You name 
 I will worship You Lord all my days 
 I will worship You forever 
 I will worship You forever

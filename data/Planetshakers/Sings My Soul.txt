O the love of my Saviour 
 O the love of my King 
 Pierced for my transgressions 
 Broken for my sin 
 My punishment was upon You 
 You wore the crown of my shame 
 And You bought me life eternal 
 With the last breath You gave 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul 
 The song from my heart overflows 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul to Thee 
 My heart need wander no longer 
 For in Your grace I shall stay 
 I am reconciled to Heaven 
 Now forever to praise 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul 
 The song from my heart overflows 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul to Thee 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul 
 Constant and true in trial and storm 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul to Thee 
 Holy, Holy 
 Holy are You Lord 
 Worthy, worthy forever 
 Jesus, Your love leads my heart to praise 
 Holy, Holy 
 Holy are You Lord 
 Worthy, worthy forever 
 Jesus, Your love leads my heart to praise 
 Holy, Holy 
 Holy are You Lord 
 Worthy, worthy forever 
 Jesus, Your love leads my heart to praise 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul 
 The song from my heart overflows 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul to Thee 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul 
 Constant and true in trial and storm 
 Sings my soul 
 Sings my soul to Thee 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This love You have for me 
 It goes beyond my wildest dreams 
 So unbelievable yet so amazing 
 I'm lost for words 
 Time and again You reach out for me 
 Looking past my faults You see me destiny 
 Your hand of love I feel it touch me 
 And set me free 
 I will praise You Jesus 
 All my days 
 Sing of all Your great deeds 
 And Your ways 
 I will worship now and ever more 
 Love so amazing 
 I adore

God I've found in You 
 Everything I was searching for 
 And You've given me 
 What I needed and so much more 
 So I'm giving every part of me to You 
 Won't You take my life I'm living it for You 
 Jesus I'll live for You 
 In everything I do 
 And when You call my name 
 I just can't help but sing Your praises 
 I'll give You all my praise 
 I'll serve You all my days 
 Gonna let the whole world know 
 Jesus I am so in love with You 
 Every day it's You I live for 
 Gonna serve You all my days 
 Every step I take You're with me 
 Jesus You're the only way

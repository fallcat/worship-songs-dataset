Get up on your feet 
 Get up on your feet and praise 
 We're moving forward now, nothing will hold us back 
 With every step we'll give You praise 
 We are victorious, 'cause You have come to us 
 We know the battle is Yours 
 Death couldn't hold You down 
 In You my faith be found 
 Come on, come on make it louder, this song of victory 
 Come on, come on lift Him higher, the One who set us free 
 Come on, come on shout it louder, it's time to celebrate 
 Come on, come on don't stop praising, 'cause we are free today

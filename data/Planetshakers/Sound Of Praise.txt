Your love is breaking through. 
 You're driving out all my fears. 
 You're making all things new. 
 Your love's redeeming the years. 
 All of creation awaits. 
 As we begin to sing. 
 Everybody get up it's time to party. 
 It's all for Jesus name. 
 This is the sound of praise. 
 It's supernatural, the way he loves us all. 
 Come on and lift your faith. 
 This is the sound of, the sound of praise. 
 It's all for Jesus. 
 It's all for Jesus name.

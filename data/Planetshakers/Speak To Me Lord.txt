I look to You my God 
 And lift my eyes to see 
 Incline my ear to You 
 Your voice I long to hear 
 Jesus here I stand 
 Reaching out my hands 
 Waiting for Your voice 
 Jesus I need You more 
 Jesus I want to hear Your voice 
 Jesus I want to know You more 
 Speak to me Lord 
 Speak to me Lord 
 Speak to me Lord 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 My heart cries out 
 My soul cries out 
 My heart cries out for You 
 My heart cries out 
 My soul cries out for more 
 My heart cries out for You

The experience 
 Of Your presence 
 Changes everything 
 Holy Spirit 
 We give You precedence 
 Over all 
 We want more 
 More 
 More than ever before 
 Spirit of the living God 
 Have Your way in us 
 Have Your way in us 
 Holy fire falling down 
 Hearts are crying out 
 How we need You now 
 Spirit of God 
 Take us deeper 
 Into the power 
 Of Your healing 
 Move in closer 
 Open hearts Lord 
 To hear You speaking 
 We want more 
 More 
 More than ever before 
 Spirit of the living God 
 Have Your way in us 
 Have Your way in us 
 Holy fire falling down 
 Hearts are crying out 
 How we need You now 
 Spirit of God 
 We want more 
 More 
 More than ever before 
 (x4) 
 Spirit of the living God 
 Have Your way in us 
 Have Your way in us 
 Holy fire falling down 
 Hearts are crying out 
 How we need You now 
 Spirit of God

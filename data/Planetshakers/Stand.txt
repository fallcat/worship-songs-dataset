Today, today is the day 
 I'm living for You 
 No more doing it my way 
 I make the change today 
 I don't wanna talk about it 
 I don't wanna think about it 
 I don't wanna dream about it 
 Living my way 
 From now I'm living for You 
 Everything I'm doing for You 
 I will stand, I'll stand for You 
 I'll stand, I'll stand, I'll stand for You 
 I will stand, stand for You 
 Everything I do, is for You my Jesus 
 I will stand, I'll stand for You 
 I'll stand, I'll stand, I'll stand for You 
 Whatever happens to me 
 I make a promise to be 
 True to my Lord and Saviour 
 I will stand

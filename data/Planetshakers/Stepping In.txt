I'm running towards You 
 I'm yearning, Lord for You 
 With every part of me 
 I'm chasing Your glory 
 Pursuing Your presence 
 With every part of me 
 With every part of me 
 There's no place I'd rather be 
 Than here with You 
 Heaven is an open door 
 And I'm running through 
 I'm stepping in to the secret place 
 I'm moving in, into Your embrace 
 It's just me and You 
 I'm pressing in, I can hear You call 
 I'm leaning in, 'cause I know there's more 
 I will wait on You 
 I will wait on You 
 I'm running towards You 
 I'm yearning, Lord for You 
 With every part of me 
 With every part of me 
 There's no place I'd rather be 
 Than here with You 
 Heaven is an open door 
 I'm running through 
 I'm stepping in to the secret place 
 I'm moving in, into Your embrace 
 It's just me and You 
 I'm pressing in, I can hear You call 
 I'm leaning in, 'cause I know there's more 
 I will wait on You 
 I will wait on You 
 I lean into Your love 
 Father Your arms will carry me 
 I lean into Your love 
 Spirit Your wind will hold me 
 I lean into Your love 
 Father Your arms will carry me 
 I lean into Your love 
 Spirit Your wind will hold me 
 It's just me and You 
 It's just me and You 
 It's just me and You 
 It's just me and You 
 It's just me and You

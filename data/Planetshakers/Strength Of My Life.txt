You set my heart ablaze with Your Holy fire 
 And now I stand amazed by Your love and favour 
 I don't know where I will be 
 I don't know what I would do now 
 If Your love hadn't saved me 
 You are the strength of my life 
 And I'm eternally grateful 
 Great are You Lord over all 
 We will declare Lord You are faithful 
 Great are You Lord over all 
 Great are You Lord 
 You are the strength of my life Lord 
 It doesn't matter what may come my way 
 You are the strength of my life Lord 
 I'm holding on to You

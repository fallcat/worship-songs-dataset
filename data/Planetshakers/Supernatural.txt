Something never seen never heard before 
 It's supernatural 
 Step into the new see the old no more 
 It's supernatural 
 Take us higher 
 Take us deeper 
 Take us into everything you have for us 
 We're going up moving out of the natural 
 We're stepping in to the promises of Your Word 
 We're going up to the supernatural 
 Whoa 
 Are you ready (are you ready) 
 For His power (for His power) 
 I am ready (I am ready) 
 It's supernatural (it's supernatural)

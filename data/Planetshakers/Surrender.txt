All that I am is Yours 
 All that I have is Yours 
 I give You my heart and soul 
 Lord, I'm Yours 
 Lord everyday is Yours 
 Lord every breath is Yours 
 I'm giving my life to You 
 Lord I'm Yours 
 You alone are worthy of all praise 
 You alone are worthy of all praise 
 I surrender all to You 
 I surrender all to You 
 I am nothing without You 
 Jesus Christ, take my life 
 It's all for You 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 You're worthy of all praise 
 Jesus

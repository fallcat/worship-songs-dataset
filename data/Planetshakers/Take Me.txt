Hear you voice 
 A gentle whisper 
 Calls from deep whithin 
 On my knees my heart it crys out 
 I'm longing to draw near 
 Hide me now under the shadow of Your wings 
 Lord into your presence I will run 
 Take me away with you 
 I wanna be close to you 
 Take me away into the secret place 
 Take me into your arms 
 Here in your presence I belong 
 Take me away into the secret place 
 Let Your glory fill this place oh god 
 Fill this place 
 Oh Lord 
 The secret place 
 Wanna go there with you 
 The secret place 
 Oh want you take me there Lord

By His stripes, we are healed 
 By His nail-pierced hands, we're free 
 By His blood, we're washed clean 
 Now we have the victory 
 The power of sin is broken 
 Jesus overcame it all 
 He has won our freedom 
 Jesus has won it all 
 Hallelujah, You have won the victory 
 Hallelujah, You have won it all for me 
 Death could not hold You down, You are the risen King 
 Seated in majesty, You are the risen King 
 By His stripes, we are healed 
 By His nail-pierced hands, we're free 
 By His blood, we're washed clean 
 Now we have the victory 
 The power of sin is broken 
 Jesus overcame it all 
 He has won our freedom 
 Jesus has won it all 
 Hallelujah, You have won the victory 
 Hallelujah, You have won it all for me 
 Death could not hold You down, You are the risen King 
 Seated in majesty, You are the risen King 
 Our God is risen, He is alive 
 He won the victory, He reigns on high 
 Our God is risen, He is alive 
 He won the victory, He reigns on high 
 Our God is risen, He is alive 
 He won the victory, He reigns on high 
 Our God is risen, He is alive 
 He won the victory, He reigns on high 
 Hallelujah, You have won the victory 
 Hallelujah, You have won it all for me 
 Death could not hold You down, You are the risen King 
 Seated in majesty, You are the risen King 
 Hallelujah, You have won the victory 
 Hallelujah, You have won it all for me 
 Death could not hold You down, You are the risen King 
 Seated in majesty, You are the risen King

We're lifting up Your name, 
 We live to bring You praise, 
 Cause there's no one like You 
 All glory to Your name, 
 Cause you alone are great, 
 And there is no one like You 
 We will lift You higher, 
 Higher than all other names, 
 Cause You are worthy 
 Jesus You are the one, 
 Who is worthy of the highest praise 
 Jesus You are the one, 
 You are the one, the king of glory 
 Sing it loud, sing it proud, For He is king 
 He alone, is the one, He's everything

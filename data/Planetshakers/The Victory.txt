Where You are is liberty, 
 Cause You have won the victory, 
 We're living in Your freedom 
 We walk by faith and not by sight, 
 Praise You Lord with all our might, 
 We're living in Your freedom 
 Shout it out! 
 We will sing it loud! 
 Let the whole world know, 
 That You saved our, 
 Saved our soul! 
 Lord for everything You've done, 
 We will sing Your praises 
 Whoa-oh, 
 Whoa-oh, 
 We live in the freedom You've won 
 And when all is said and done, 
 You have overcome 
 Whoa-oh, 
 Whoa-oh, 
 We live in the freedom You've won 
 We will, we'll dance in the freedom, 
 That You've won, 
 We'll dance in the freedom, 
 Cause You have won, 
 You have won it all, 
 Shout it out! Shout it out!

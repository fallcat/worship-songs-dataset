All who are thirsty 
 Come and drink the living water 
 Taste and see, taste and see 
 There is a river 
 Where power flows, healing the city 
 Miracles, miracles 
 God is doing something that we've never seen before 
 Our God is moving, our God is healing 
 You can step into the waters and receive 
 There's a miracle for all who will believe 
 God is moving 
 All who are hungry 
 Drawing near, come to the table 
 God is here, God is here 
 All who are ready 
 It's time to go, the water's rising 
 Overflow, overflow 
 God is doing something that we've never seen before 
 Our God is moving, our God is healing 
 You can step into the waters and receive 
 There's a miracle for all who will believe 
 God is moving 
 Water is rising, the water is rising 
 And I'm stepping into my healing 
 Ever increasing, it's ever increasing 
 So I'm pressing in, God is moving, moving 
 Water is rising, the water is rising 
 And I'm stepping into my healing 
 Ever increasing, it's ever increasing 
 So I'm pressing in, God is moving, moving, moving 
 Our God is moving, our God is healing 
 You can step into the waters and receive 
 There's a miracle for all who will believe 
 You can step into the waters and receive 
 There's a miracle for all who will believe 
 God is moving 
 God is moving 
 God is moving

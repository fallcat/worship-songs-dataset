When I'm at my weakest 
 Your grace is at its strongest 
 Your light is at its brightest 
 Filling me with hope 
 Your love is overwhelming 
 Your spirit is compelling 
 And Jesus, I surrender 
 Every part of me 
 I breathe You in and I have life again 
 Your praises fill my lungs 
 I sing again 
 So let everything that's in me 
 Sing Your praise and give You glory 
 Jesus, You are strong and mighty 
 And there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Even in the darkness 
 When I'm at my lowest 
 I know You are with me 
 Showing me the way 
 I breathe You in and I have life again 
 Your praises fill my lungs 
 I sing again 
 So let everything that's in me 
 Sing Your praise and give You glory 
 Jesus, You are strong and mighty 
 And there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Unfailing love 
 This I know 
 For all my days 
 I'll behold 
 The goodness of Your overflow 
 There is no one like You 
 You're the One 
 Surrounding me 
 And You provide 
 My every need 
 I trust in You and I believe 
 There is no one like You 
 Oh, there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You, ooh 
 There is no one like You 
 Yeah-eh-eh-eh 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Yeah, there is no one like You 
 Yeah

We gather your praises 
 We're making it loud 
 And all of creation 
 Will join in the sound 
 The song of your freedom 
 Is all around 
 And we the redeemed will 
 Shout it out 
 This is the shout of victory 
 This is the shout 'cause we are free 
 You are high and lifted up 
 More than anything 
 All creation lifts You higher and higher 
 We shout this song of victory 
 And we'll keep singing 
 In Jesus there's freedom 
 This is the moment this is the hour 
 This is the time we're gonna shout it out 
 You are our freedom You are alive 
 Jesus Jesus

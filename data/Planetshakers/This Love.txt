This love You have for me 
 It goes beyond my wildest dreams 
 And I am in awe 
 This grace You've shown to me 
 It's made me see the light of day 
 And I love You Lord 
 There is no one like You 
 You alone are great 
 We give You all the glory 
 We give You all the praise 
 Hey hey I'm in love with You 
 I'm sold out for You 
 You are everything to me 
 Hey hey I believe in You 
 Lord I know that no one 
 Can take this love away 
 I'm gonna praise You everyday 
 It's time to get Your praise on

All I long for, all I hope for 
 Is found in You 
 In Your presence, in Your glory 
 I am found in You 
 Hold me in Your arms forever 
 Never let me go 
 This one thing that I seek 
 To dwell in Your house 
 All the days of my life with You 
 Let me stay here with You 
 In Your presence I'll live 
 In Your presence I'll live with You 
 All I long for, all I hope for 
 Is found in You 
 In Your presence, in Your glory 
 I am found in You 
 Hold me in Your arms forever 
 Never let me go 
 This one thing that I seek 
 To dwell in Your house 
 All the days of my life with You 
 Let me stay here with You 
 In Your presence I'll live 
 In Your presence I'll live with You 
 This one thing that I seek 
 To dwell in Your house 
 All the days of my life with You 
 Let me stay here with You 
 In Your presence I'll live 
 In Your presence I'll live with You 
 Open heaven

 We cry out for more of You 
 Open heaven

 We cry out for more of You 
 Open heaven

 This one thing that I seek 
 To dwell in Your house 
 All the days of my life with You

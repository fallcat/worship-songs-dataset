It's the way You move 
 And everything You do 
 The way You touch my heart again 
 I'm in love with You 
 This is why 
 I praise You, I praise You 
 I lift You high 
 I praise You, I praise You 
 Through it all 
 I will keep on singing to You 
 Through it all 
 I will keep believing in You 
 Whatever happens 
 There is one thing that I know 
 You are with me 
 Everywhere that I may go 
 I will trust You 
 And I'll praise You through it all 
 Yeah, I'll praise You through it all 
 Yeah, I'll praise You through it all 
 As I lift my eyes 
 Your light is shining bright 
 And I choose to sing again 
 For You give me life 
 This is why 
 I praise You, I praise You 
 I lift You high 
 I praise You, I praise You 
 Through it all 
 I will keep on singing to You 
 Through it all 
 I will keep believing in You 
 Whatever happens 
 There is one thing that I know 
 You are with me 
 Everywhere that I may go 
 I will trust You 
 And I'll praise You through it all 
 Yeah, I'll praise You through it all 
 Yeah, I'll praise You through it all 
 Even on the darkest day 
 Nothing will stop my praise 
 Nothing will stop my praise 
 Whatever may come my way 
 I'll lift up Your name 
 I'll lift up Your name 
 Even on the darkest day 
 Nothing will stop my praise 
 Nothing will stop my praise 
 Whatever may come my way 
 I'll lift up Your name 
 I'll lift up Your name 
 Whatever happens 
 There is one thing that I know 
 You are with me 
 Everywhere that I may go 
 I will trust You 
 And I'll praise You through it all 
 Yeah, I'll praise You through it all 
 Yeah, I'll praise You through it all

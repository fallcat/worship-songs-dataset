You are here as we lift You up 
 You are riding on our praise 
 Be enthroned over everything 
 You are seated in our praise 
 This is prophetic, I can feel it in the air 
 We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere 
 With hearts open now 
 Everybody singing out, whoa 
 Turn it up, this sound of praise 
 Make it louder than any other 
 Lift Him up and shout His name over all 
 As we praise I can feel the change 
 As Your presence now invades 
 Hear the sound of the broken chains 
 Prison doors are giving way 
 This is prophetic, I can feel it in the air 
 We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere 
 With hearts open now 
 Everybody singing out, I am free 
 Our praise goes up 
 Your rain comes down 
 With shouts of praise we celebrate 
 King of glory, enter in 
 You are riding on our praise, O Lord

You are the first, You are the last 
 No one is greater than You 
 No name is higher 
 You never fail, always prevail 
 We put our trust in You 
 God of the breakthrough 
 You make a way where there seems to be no way 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 For He has done great things 
 So forever we will sing 
 To You 
 To You 
 Who counts the stars, calls them by name? 
 The God of all creation 
 The King of heaven 
 Behold He comes, God's risen Son 
 Enthroned in majesty 
 His glory surrounds Him 
 Holy is the Lord, we sing holy is the Lord 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 For He has done great things 
 So forever we will sing 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 For He has done great things 
 So forever we will sing 
 To You 
 All the glory, honour, goes to You our God 
 For You are holy, mighty, clothed in majesty 
 (x2) 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 For He has done great things 
 So forever we will sing 
 (x2) 
 Holy is the Lord, we sing holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord, we sing holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord, we sing holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord, we sing holy is the Lord 
 (x2) 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 Unto God be all of the praise 
 For He has done great things 
 So forever we will sing

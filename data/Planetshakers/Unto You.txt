I live for You 
 All of my days belong to You 
 You draw me to Your tenderness 
 You make me new 
 Into the secret place I will run 
 Where my heart can be free 
 In the grace that I've found 
 Unto You 
 Be all glory and praise 
 How my heart seeks Your face 
 As I'm waiting on You 
 Only You 
 Are my strength and my tower 
 Fill my life with Your power 
 As I stand here in awe of You 
 I stand here in awe of You

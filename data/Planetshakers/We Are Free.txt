Chains are broken, cause You have spoken 
 It is finished on the cross 
 Now I'm living in Your freedom 
 Jesus You have set me free 
 By the power of Your Spirit 
 Every captive is released 
 For this purpose, I am living 
 Cause Jesus You have set me free 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 No, nothing's gonna keep me down 
 Jesus has set me free, I'm free indeed 
 I will give You praise 
 With everything I am I'll praise 
 Whatever may come my way 
 You have won the victory, oh You set me free 
 I'm surrounded by Your goodness 
 I am covered by Your grace 
 My heart is grateful, forever thankful 
 Cause Jesus You have set me free 
 Nothing's gonna hold me back 
 No, nothing's gonna keep me down 
 Jesus has set me free, I'm free indeed 
 I will give You praise 
 With everything I am I'll praise 
 Whatever may come my way 
 You have won the victory 
 Oh, I will give You praise 
 With everything I am I'll praise 
 Whatever may come my way 
 You have won the victory, You set me free 
 We are free, we are free 
 And we have the victory 
 We are free, we are free 
 And we have the victory 
 We are free, we are free 
 And we have the victory 
 We are free, we are free 
 And we have the victory 
 I will give You praise 
 With everything I am I'll praise 
 Whatever may come my way 
 You have won the victory 
 I will give You praise 
 With everything I am I'll praise 
 Whatever may come my way 
 You have won the victory, You set me free

We speak strength into these weary bones 
 We speak the healing power of the Lord 
 For in His name there are miracles 
 We speak nothing is incurable 
 'Cause we know that nothing is impossible 
 For in His name there are miracles 
 Our God is more than able 
 Our God will never fail 
 He is always with us 
 He is faithful 'til the end 
 We speak, happiness to be restored 
 Rise up and give the glory to the Lord 
 For in His name there are miracles 
 Our God is more than able 
 Our God will never fail 
 He is always with us 
 He is faithful 'til the end 
 Our God is full of power 
 Our God the strongest tower 
 He is always with us 
 He is faithful 'til the end 
 We speak life, we speak life 
 In the name of Jesus, there is healing 
 Flowing in this place 
 As we lift our voice in faith 
 And we give all the praise 
 To the One who's worthy of all glory 
 Jesus is His name 
 So we lift our voice in praise 
 We speak life, we speak life 
 In the name of Jesus, there is healing 
 Flowing in this place 
 As we lift our voice in faith 
 And we give all the praise 
 To the One who's worthy of all glory 
 Jesus is His name 
 So we lift our voice in praise

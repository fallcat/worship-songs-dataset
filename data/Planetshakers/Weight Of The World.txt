Sweetest sound I've ever heard 
 Sound of heaven calling out for me 
 Before I ever called Your name 
 You gave Your life for me 
 And all the things I ever did 
 You took them on the cross 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You did it all for me 
 Yes You did it all for me 
 Greatest love I've ever known 
 That You would give Your life to set me free 
 Before I ever called Your name 
 You paid the price for me 
 And all the things I ever did 
 You bore on Calvary 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You did it all for me 
 Yes You did it all for me 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You did it all for me 
 Yes You did it all for me 
 Take me as I am 
 Into Your nail scarred hands 
 And when I run so far away 
 You always call me back again 
 Into Your open arms 
 No matter what I've done 
 Amazing grace has found me here 
 Because of what You've done I'm free 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You took the weight of the world on Your shoulders 
 You did it all for me 
 Yes You did it all for me

Welcome into this place 
 Welcome into this broken vessel 
 You desire to abide in the praises of your people 
 So we lift our hands, and lift our hearts 
 As we offer up this praise unto your name 
 Creation declares your glory 
 And the universe declares majesty 
 Yet you choose to abide in the praises of your people 
 So we lift our hands and we lift our hearts 
 As we offer up this praise unto your name

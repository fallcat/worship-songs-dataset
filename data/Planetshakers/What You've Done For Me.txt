(Repeat:) 
 In the darkest night 
 You called my name 
 Beckoned me to come 
 Let me hear your voice 
 Day by day 
 Your the holy one 
 I will sing 
 Of your freedom 
 I will tell of all the wondrous things you've done 
 Let me run 
 In your presence 
 Let me dance gonna get a little crazy for you 
 Can't stop thinking about you Lord 
 Can't stop thinking about your love 
 Can't stop thinking about what you've done for me 
 Can't stop thinking about you Lord 
 Can't stop thinking about your love 
 Can't stop thinking about what you've done for me

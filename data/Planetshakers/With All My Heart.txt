 Make my spirit new

 Restore to me 
 Salvations joy 
 Teach me your way 
 'Cause all I want is you 
 All I want is you 
 Chrous: 
 With all my heart I will worship 
 With all my soul I will sing your praise 
 With everything that is in me 
 I will glorify your holy name 
 Repeat chorus twice 
 Repeat lots of times: 
 I will bless the Lord 
 Repeat lots of times: 
 I will bless the Lord

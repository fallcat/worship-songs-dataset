 Wonderful Saviour You are 
 You reign in Heaven 
 Your plans are perfect in every way 
 Let Your kingdom come now 
 On earth as in Heaven 
 Let Your majesty 
 Reign over all the earth 
 Spirit of God fall in this place 
 Let Your power come and fill us 
 Spirit of God we need Your touch 
 You are all I'm live for 
 You're all I'm live for 
 I will praise You 
 I will magnify Your name 
 I will praise You 
 The God of everlasting

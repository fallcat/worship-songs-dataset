Oh Lord 
 You have given to me all I need 
 And I pray 
 For your will to be done 
 And I ask 
 For your spirit to work in my life 
 And that I can 
 Be a blessing to you 
 Holy one 
 Your the light in my darkest day 
 Showing me 
 The power of your truth 
 And I ask 
 For the touch of your spirit in me 
 Giving me 
 The faith to believe 
 And I will stand here 
 Lost in your love 
 And I will worship forevermore 
 I will stand here 
 Ever amazed 
 And I will worship forevermore 
 Oh Lord 
 You have given to me all I need

 For your will to be done

 For your spirit to work in my life 
 And that I can 
 Be a blessing to you 
 And I will stand here 
 Lost in your love 
 And I will worship forevermore 
 I will stand here 
 Ever amazed 
 And I will worship forevermore

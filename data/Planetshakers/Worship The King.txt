Walking down the road called life 
 Thinking how my world has changed 
 Since I met the saving grace 
 Of the man they called Jesus Christ 
 * He's not just an ordinary guy 
 He is supernatural in all ways 
 He's not just in my imagination 
 He is real in everyway 
 I will stand in awe (2X) 
 Worship the King of Glory 
 Open up the doors, lift up the gates 
 The King of Glory, may He enter in 
 May His power fall, may His glory fill 
 All the earth 
 People come and people go, 
 Something's in and then it's out 
 One thing that remains the same 
 Is the Love I've found Jesus Christ

Your faithfulness never fails 
 Your faithfulness everyday 
 You're the same 
 Unfailing love sets me free 
 Unfailing love you lead me 
 With your hand 
 And all I know 
 With your arms around me 
 Your face is all that I seek 
 Your love and grace 
 Pick me up and hold me 
 You alone are holy 
 For You alone are great in power 
 You alone are my strong tower 
 And I will lift my heart and soul 
 To worship you alone 
 For You alone are my desire 
 You have set my heart on fire 
 And I will lift my heart and soul 
 To worship you alone 
 Worship you alone 
 And I will follow after you 
 For you are my desire 
 Oh Jesus, my heart belongs to you

You're holy 
 You're righteous 
 Great in majesty 
 Angels bow down 
 Giving glory to the King of kings 
 And we sing 
 Blessing and honor 
 And we sing 
 Holy is the Lord almighty 
 Worthy is the Lamb 
 Majesty and Power 
 To the Name above all names 
 Glory to the King 
 We will sing forever 
 Holy is the Lord 
 All Glory 
 All Honor 
 All power to You 
 God forever

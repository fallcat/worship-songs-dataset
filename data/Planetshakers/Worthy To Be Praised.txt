Lord, I come into Your presence. 
 Here I stand in awesome reverence, 
 Falling before the wonder of Your Name. 
 Humbly now, Lord, I surrender. 
 This offering to You forever. 
 Take all I am and use me, Lord, I pray. 
 Make me what You want me to be 
 Teach me Your ways 
 I lay down my life for You. 
 Throw down my crowns before You. 
 Give up my all for Your Name. 
 My Saviour, how I adore You. 
 Healer, my heart longs for You. 
 Jesus, You're worthy to be praised. 
 Jesus, You are Lord forever (x16) 
 Jesus, You are Lord

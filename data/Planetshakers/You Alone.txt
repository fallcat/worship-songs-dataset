My greatest joy is within Your presence 
 Where the love You gave saved me 
 And my most treasured times are in the stillness 
 Where Your loving arms hold me 
 Cause You're all I want 
 You are all I search for 
 It is You I've always longed for 
 God I come 
 To be here with You 
 To be here for You and You alone 
 I worship You 
 With my heart and soul 
 Everything I give to You alone 
 All creation sings Your praises 
 Crowns You Lord of all 
 Kings and rulers bow before You 
 Hail You Lord of lords

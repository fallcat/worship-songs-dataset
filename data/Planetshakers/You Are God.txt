Where there is sickness, there will be healing 
 Where there is bondage, there will be freedom 
 Where there is sorrow, there will be laughter 
 Where there is darkness, Your light will shine bright 
 For the old has passed away 
 And this is a brand new day 
 You are God, You are God 
 You are so glorious, You are so powerful 
 You are God, You are God 
 You are victorious, You are the One Jesus 
 Where there is blindness, there will be vision 
 Where there is lacking, there'll be provision 
 Where there is hurting, there will be healing 
 Where there is downfall, there will be victory 
 We call upon Your Name Lord 
 The Name above all names 
 We call upon the Name that saves

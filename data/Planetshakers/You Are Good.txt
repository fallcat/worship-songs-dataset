You are God, And I am not, 
 So take Your place, Above my life 
 With everything, and all I am, 
 I'm holding on, Onto Your plan 
 My life is not my own, 
 So come and take control, 
 Cause You alone are good 
 You are good, All the time, 
 And Your love endures forever, 
 You are good, All the time, 
 You are good. 
 There's no other name, 
 No other name like Jesus

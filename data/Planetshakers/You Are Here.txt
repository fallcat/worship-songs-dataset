You came all this way for me 
 With every step, my healing draws closer 
 You pushed through the crowd for me 
 Jesus, You saw what others could not see 
 Your voice quiets the noise 
 Now heaven's all I hear 
 You are here with me 
 You are here with me 
 You fill the atmosphere 
 Your glory is revealed 
 You are here 
 You are here 
 I know You're here with me 
 I feel You now, drawing me closer 
 You are alive in me 
 Flooding my heart over and over 
 Your voice quiets the noise 
 Now heaven's all I hear 
 Your touch awakens my heart 
 Your face is all I see 
 You are here with me 
 You are here with me 
 You fill the atmosphere 
 Your glory is revealed 
 You are here with me 
 You are here with me 
 Jesus, I believe 
 You're everything I need 
 You are here 
 Woah, there's nothing like Your presence, woah 
 Woah, there's nothing like Your presence 
 Nothing like Your presence, Lord 
 Woah, there's nothing like Your presence, woah

Here I stand my life Before You 
 Can't believe the price you paid 
 Gave it all just for me 
 I lay my life upon the alter 
 Take me now 
 I place my life in your hands 
 King Of Heaven 
 You're my saviour 
 You left Your place of glory 
 Giving your life just for me 
 How could I ever repay you 
 You came into my life lord 
 You set me free 
 Everything I am I give to you 
 You are Holy Holy 
 Take my life and everything I do 
 You are Holy Holy 
 King Of Heaven 
 You're my saviour 
 You left Your place of glory 
 Giving your life just for me 
 How could I ever repay you 
 You came into my life lord 
 You set me free 
 You are Holy 
 Give You Glory

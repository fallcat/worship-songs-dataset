Holy One 
 Breath of life breathe into me 
 Come and saturate my heart 
 I stand in awo 
 Take me deeper into You 
 Come and wash me with Your Love 
 Draw me closer to You 
 And You draw me closer to You 
 Holy, I will sing forever 
 Give You my heart 
 You alone are God of all the earth 
 And I live for You 
 Mighty, King of Heaven 
 Glory and honour to You 
 Shine Your light for all the world to see 
 Cause You live in me 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 You are my God 
 You are my God

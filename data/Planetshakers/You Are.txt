God, You are my God 
 And I will praise 
 Your Name for all of my days 
 Your Kingdom will reign 
 Forever always 
 Name above all names 
 King of kings, Lord of lords 
 Jesus Your Majesty 
 My God and my King 
 My everything 
 Nothing else can compare 
 To Your love 
 Show me Your ways 
 King of all days 
 My heart cries out for You 
 For You are the King of all kings 
 And You are the Lord of all lords 
 I will lift up my voice 
 I will worship forever 
 I will worship You forever 
 Jesus King my Lord my Saviour

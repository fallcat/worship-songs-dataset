You have known me before I learned to breathe 
 You have searched me, there's nothing You don't see 
 You have witnessed my triumphs and my falls 
 You love me through it all 
 You love me through it all 
 I am not my mistakes 
 I am a child of God 
 You have called me by name 
 I'm home in my Father's arms 
 I am amazed 
 Caught in the wonder of Your love 
 Cleansed by the power of Your touch 
 Father, You call me beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 You have crowned me with favour and with peace 
 You have silenced the lies I once believed 
 You accept me, You claim me as Your own 
 You're never letting go 
 You're never letting go 
 I am not my mistakes 
 I am a child of God 
 You have called me by name 
 I'm home in my Father's arms 
 I am amazed 
 Caught in the wonder of Your love 
 Cleansed by the power of Your touch 
 Father, You call me beautiful 
 I stand in awe 
 Lost in the depths of Your mercy 
 Your heart beats like thunder around me 
 Father, You call me beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 My sin and shame have been outweighed 
 By endless love and perfect grace 
 I hear Your voice above the waves 
 You call me beautiful 
 My innocence has been restored 
 No fear can hold me anymore 
 For You are mine and I am Yours 
 Father, You're beautiful 
 My sin and shame have been outweighed 
 By endless love and perfect grace 
 I hear Your voice above the waves 
 You call me beautiful 
 My innocence has been restored 
 No fear can hold me anymore 
 For You are mine and I am Yours 
 Father, You're beautiful 
 I am amazed 
 Caught in the wonder of Your love 
 Cleansed by the power of Your touch

Let the words of my mouth and the thoughts from my heart glorify You 
 Everywhere that I go and everything that I do may it please You 
 Everything I have is not 
 My own but it is for You 
 Everything I am is Yours alone 
 You have my heart. You have my soul 
 You have my life. You have it all 
 Lord there is nothing I'll hold back from You 
 You have it all 
 Come and take 
 Your place above everything 
 You're worthy 
 Lord You're worthy

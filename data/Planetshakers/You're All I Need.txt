Your grace is all I need 
 Your love is all I ever wanted 
 Your presence in my life 
 Jesus Your touch is my desire 
 My heart it sings for You 
 My every breath is Yours my Jesus 
 I live to worship You 
 Jesus You're everything 
 You are all I want 
 You are everything I need 
 My soul thirsts for You 
 You are more than life to me 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 Jesus 
 You're all I live for 
 Jesus

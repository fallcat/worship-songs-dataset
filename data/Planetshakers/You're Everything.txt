You have 
 Come into my heart 
 Turned my life around 
 You have 
 Made me something new 
 Turned me upside down 
 I will 
 Never be the same 
 You show me how to change 
 Always 
 Will my heart be true 
 'Cause I wanna live for You 
 I'm gonna let my praises ring 
 'Cause You are the One that I want 
 You are the One that I need 
 You are the One I love 
 'Cause Jesus You're everything 
 You are the Great and Mighty 
 You are the Light inside me

 Come into my heart 
 Turned my life around

 Made me something new 
 Turned me upside down

 We're gonna dance before the King

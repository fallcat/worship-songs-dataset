Break of day 
 Your light it shines on us 
 And Your Glory fills this place 
 Like the sun it rises up on us 
 It's the Glory of Your face 
 And I lift my eyes to Heaven 
 And I lift my eyes to Heaven 
 Your Glory 
 The whole earth is filled with Your Glory 
 The nations cry out they sing 
 Holy, holy is the Lord 
 Show me Your Glory 
 Show me Your Glory 
 Show me Your Glory

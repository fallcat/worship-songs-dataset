High up in the mountains cutting the timbers down 
 All I do from dusk to dawn is follow that mule around 
 I had no intentions of staying away this long 
 But I guess I won't be home till I'm dead and gone 
 Picked peaches down in Georgia, cotton in Tennessee 
 Trying to make a livin's going to be the death of me 
 So if you want to find me just look where the wind has blown 
 Hun, I won't be home till I'm dead and gone 
 Go find another fella if you want to 
 I won't say you ever done me wrong 
 This of heart ain't nothing to hold onto 
 Hun, I won't be home till I'm dead and gone 
 Up here in these tall pines leanin' into the wind 
 Doing my best to catch my breath till I hit the road again 
 The only thing I know how to do is keep on rambling on 
 I guess I won't be home till I'm dead and gone 
 Go find another fella if you want to 
 I won't say you ever done me wrong 
 This of heart ain't nothing to hold onto 
 Hun, I won't be home till I'm dead and gone 
 There's a great big shade tree shadowing the stones 
 Where I want you to lay me down to rest my weary bones 
 There ain't really nowhere else in this earth I belong 
 Guess I won't be home till I'm dead and gone 
 Go find another fella if you want to 
 I won't say you ever done me wrong 
 This of heart ain't nothing to hold onto 
 Hun, I won't be home till I'm dead and gone 
 Hun, I won't be home till I'm dead and gone

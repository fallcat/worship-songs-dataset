Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays, 
 'Cause no matter how far away you roam 
 When you pine for the sunshine 
 Of a friendly face 
 For the holidays, you can't beat 
 Home, sweet home 
 I met a man who lives in Tennessee 
 And he was headin' for Pennsylvania 
 And some home made pumpkin pie 
 From Pennsylvania folks a travelin' down 
 To Dixie's sunny shore 
 From Atlantic to Pacific, man, 
 The traffic is terrific 
 And there's no place like home 
 For the holidays, 'cause no matter 
 How far away you roam 
 If you want to be happy in a million ways 
 For the holidays, you can't beat 
 Home, sweet home 
 I met a man who lives in Tennessee 
 And he was headin' for Pennsylvania 
 And some home made pumpkin pie 
 From Pennsylvania folks a travelin' down 
 To Dixie's sunny shore 
 From Atlantic to Pacific, gee 
 The traffic is terrific 
 And there's no place like home 
 For the holidays, 'cause no matter 
 How far away you roam 
 If you want to be happy in a million ways 
 For the holidays, you can't beat 
 Home, sweet home 
 For the holidays, you can't beat 
 Home sweet home

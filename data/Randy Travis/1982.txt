Operator, please connect me 
 With 1982 
 I need to make apologies 
 For what I didn't do 
 I sure do need to tell her 
 That I've thought the whole thing through 
 And now it's clear that she is what 
 I should have held on to 
 They say hindsight's 20/20 
 But I'm nearly going blind 
 From staring at her photograph 
 And wishing she was mine 
 It's that same old lost love story 
 It's sad but it's true 
 There was a time when she was mine 
 In 1982 
 Postman, can you sell me 
 A special kind of stamp 
 One to send a letter from 
 This crazy, lonely man 
 Back into the wasted years 
 Of my living past 
 I need to tell her now I know 
 How long my love will last 
 They say hindsight's 20/20 
 But I'm nearly going blind 
 From staring at her photograph 
 And wishing she was mine 
 It's that same old lost love story 
 It's sad but it's true 
 There was a time when she was mine 
 In 1982 
 Losing my mind going back in time 
 To 1982

(Randy) 
 Not too many years ago 
 When dreams was coming true 
 I'd reach for inspiration 
 Sometimes it would be you 
 I'd hear you on the radio 
 I sure did like your sound 
 Say it's good to know there's still 
 A few ol' country boys around 
 (George) 
 From the smoke it's hard to tell 
 What's coming down the line 
 We heard you were a fast train 
 Coming out of Caroline 
 We wondered what you were haulin' 
 When you rolled into to town 
 Say it's good to know there's still 
 A few ol' country boys around 
 (Both) 
 You must have felt that same old feeling 
 More than once or twice 
 Guitars pressed against our hearts 
 Under the neon lights 
 I've got to say that feeling is the best that I have found 
 Lord it's good to know there's still 
 A few ol' country boys around 
 There's a lot of truth you know 
 In our kind of songs 
 About the life you're living 
 And how love's done you wrong 
 As long as there's a jukebox 
 And a honky tonk in town 
 It's good to know there's still 
 A few ol' country boys around 
 It's good to know there's still 
 A few ol' country boys around...

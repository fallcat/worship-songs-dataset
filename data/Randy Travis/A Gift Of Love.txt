When you were born 
 There in your mother's arms 
 An angel told me always you will be 
 A gift of love from God to me 
 Though your road is long 
 I'll be right by your side 
 Through changes you'll see always you will be 
 A gift of love from God to me 
 Love took flight the day you came into my life 
 There is magic in the way I feel 
 Hearts opened wide gazing into your eyes 
 I'll be there for you 
 As long as I am alive 
 I have never loved 
 More than I love you 
 A gift for free always you will be 
 A gift of love from God to me

This ole heart of mine 
 Is now showing signs 
 From the wear and tear of times 
 You have taken it and crushed it 
 Then came close to throwing it away 
 Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do 
 Always hits right where it hurts 
 It's a heartache in the works 
 Looking through my tears 
 It's hard to see you care 
 When I know that you don't hear 
 When I lie away beside you 
 And cry till I see the light of day 
 Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do 
 Always hits right where it hurts 
 It's a heartache in the works 
 It's hard to keep surviving 
 When love is slowly dying 
 And all the pain without keeps building up 
 Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do 
 Always hits right where it hurts 
 It's a heartache in the works 
 Holding on to someone who don't love the same way that you do 
 Always hits right where it hurts 
 It's a heartache in the works 
 It's a heartache in the works

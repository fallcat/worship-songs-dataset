Shattered inside and scattered around 
 Were pieces of her broken heart 
 I gathered her up, the pieces I found 
 I put her back together like a busted guitar 
 But some glue holds and some glue don't 
 In spite of everything I tried 
 Somebody's stole my darlin' 
 Right before my very eyes 
 He didn't walk, talk, or push his way in 
 Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind 
 He didn't sprout wings 
 And he sure wasn't playin' no harp 
 As low as he was I couldn't see him 
 Slitherin' around in the dark 
 He must of crawled through 
 A little bitty crack in her heart 
 Copin' with gone and hoping I'm wrong 
 But I sure see a definite change 
 There's a look in her eyes that's sayin' goodbye 
 And her snuggle when I hold her don't feel the same 
 The way her heart beats for that sneaky thief 
 You would picture him dark and tall 
 But the feller that stole my darlin' 
 Lord, he'd have to be very small 
 He didn't walk, talk, push his way in 
 Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind 
 He didn't sprout wings 
 And he sure wasn't playin' no harp 
 As low as he was I couldn't see him 
 Slitherin' around in the dark 
 He must of crawled through 
 A little bitty crack in her heart 
 As low as he was I couldn't see him 
 Slitherin' around in the dark 
 He must of crawled through 
 A little bitty crack in her heart 
 Lord, he must of crawled through 
 A little bitty crack in her heart

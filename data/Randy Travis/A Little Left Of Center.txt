I walk in the rain and whistle a tune 
 I talk to the man up there in the moon 
 I know I may sound like somebody gone insane 
 I'm a fool about you baby but my heart can't explain 
 It's a little left of center 
 By heavenly design 
 Love gets carried away 
 And goes wild at times 
 When cupid aims his arrow 
 It's right on the mark 
 A little left of center 
 Just like my crazy heart 
 It leaps like a frog when you touch my hand 
 It means like a drum in a marching band 
 Can't help what it does I just follow where it leads 
 How my heart feels about you baby makes perfect sense to me 
 It's a little left of center 
 By heavenly design 
 Love gets carried away 
 And goes wild at times 
 When cupid aims his arrow 
 It's right on the mark 
 A little left of center 
 Just like my crazy heart 
 When cupid aims his arrow 
 It's right on the mark 
 A little left of center 
 Just like my crazy heart

I was supposed to be the rock 
 That you could stand on 
 Stronger than an old oak tree 
 But all you ever wanted was the one thing 
 That I never let you see - 
 The tender side of me 
 I tried to be a mountain 
 Solid and strong 
 All it took was your leavin' 
 To know I was wrong 
 A man ain't made of stone 
 A man ain't made of steel 
 The way I feel right now 
 I thought I'd never feel 
 And sometimes all it takes 
 Is facing the night alone 
 And that's when you know 
 A man ain't made of stone 
 In this world of mine there was 
 No room for weakness 
 I covered every crack in the wall 
 But there ain't no way that I can 
 Keep this secret 
 'Cause when you go 
 Like Cheriko I fall 
 You thought I wouldn't shatter 
 Would I even care? 
 But there's more to what I'm made of 
 Than this broken heart can bear 
 A man ain't made of stone 
 A man ain't made of steel 
 The way I feel right now 
 I thought I'd never feel 
 And sometimes all it takes 
 Is facing the night alone 
 And that's when you know 
 A man ain't made of stone 
 Sometimes all it takes 
 Is facing the night alone 
 And that's when you know 
 A man ain't made of stone

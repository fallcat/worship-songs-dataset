I can see it in your eyes 
 I can tell you think that I'm 
 Just some troubled soul who's lost 
 Out all alone 
 But I know each step I take 
 Brings me closer to the day 
 I'll be walking on them shining 
 Streets of gold 
 'Cause I'm just passing through 
 Wearing worn out gloves and shoes 
 But it matters not just what a man has on 
 This old flesh and blood of mine 
 Is will on borrowed time 
 It's just a place to hang my hat 
 Till I go home 
 Mister I don't know your name 
 But I thank you for your change 
 God bless you son 
 You must have Jesus in your life 
 A little help along the way 
 Never hurts too much these days 
 Even though I know in his hand 
 I'll be all right 
 'Cause I'm just passing through 
 WEaring worn out gloves and shoes 
 But it matters not just what a man has on 
 This old flesh and blood of mine 
 Is will on borrowed time 
 It's just a place to hang my hat 
 Till I go home 
 It's just a place to hang my hat 
 Till I go home

Above all kingdoms 
 Above all thrones 
 Above all wonders 
 The world has ever known 
 Above all wealth 
 And treasures of the earth 
 There's no way to measure 
 What You're worth. 
 Above all powers 
 Above all kings 
 Above all nature 
 And all created things 
 Above all wisdom 
 And all the ways of man 
 You were here 
 Before the world began. 
 Crucified 
 Laid behind the stone 
 You lived to die 
 Rejected and alone 
 Like a rose 
 Trampled on the ground 
 You took the fall 
 And thought of me 
 Above all.

 You lived to die 
 Rejected and alone 
 Like a rose 
 Trampled on the ground 
 You took the fall 
 And thought of me 
 Above all.

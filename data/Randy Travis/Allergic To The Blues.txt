Yes I hid your car keys, honey 
 Yes I hid your suitcase 
 And I'm the reason you can't find 
 Your makeup and your toothpaste 
 And I'll do anything it takes 
 To keep you here with me 
 Losing you's a sure way 
 To set off my allergies 
 I'm allergic to the blues 
 I get these teardrops in my eyes 
 You know I've always had a bad reaction to goodbyes 
 So till they find some injection 
 To calm that love rejection 
 All I've got to save me now is you 
 I'm allergic to the blues 
 It wont be five minutes 
 After you walk out that front door 
 Till I'll be fightin' for my breath and 
 Feelin' like I'm done for 
 Well they might find me froze to death 
 In our bed alone 
 Now do you really want that 
 On your conscience while you're gone 
 I'm allergic to the blues 
 I get these teardrops in my eyes 
 You know I've always had a bad reaction to goodbyes 
 So till they find some injection 
 To calm that love rejection 
 All I've got to save me now is you 
 I'm allergic to the blues

Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost but now am found 
 Was blind but now I see 
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fears relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear 
 The hour I first believed 
 Through many dangerous toils, and snares 
 I have already come 
 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far 
 And grace will lead me home 
 When we've been there ten thousand years 
 Bright shining as the sun 
 We've no less days to sing God's grace 
 Than when we first begun

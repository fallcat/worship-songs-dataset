I've walked a million miles across this floor 
 But I never have quite made it to the door 
 I never thought the time would come 
 I'd ever see this day 
 When you could make me feel so thrown away 
 I'm feeling like an old pair of shoes 
 All worn out from walking through these blues 
 There's a hole in my soul 
 And I'm really feeling used 
 I'm just like an old pair of shoes 
 You've always been my one and only love 
 It ain't no easy thing to give you up 
 Lookin' back I'm feeling like 
 There's nothing left to lose 
 This time I may just walk out on you 
 'Cause I'm feeling like an old pair of shoes 
 All worn out from walking through these blues 
 There's a hole in my soul 
 And I'm really feeling used 
 I'm just like an old pair of shoes 
 There's a hole in my soul 
 And I'm really feeling used 
 I'm just like an old pair of shoes

Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains, 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains. 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 Him whose birth the angels sing; 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ the Lord, the newborn King. 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo

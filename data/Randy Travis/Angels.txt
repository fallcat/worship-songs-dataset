Me and some of the boys were sitting around the other night 
 Started talking about politics, religion, love and life 
 And what a shame it was about 9/11 
 And what about hell and what about heaven 
 And is there or isn't there angels here on earth 
 And then one guy said 
 Well you can take that for what it's worth 
 If it's something I can see or something I can touch 
 Well I might believe in all that stuff 
 So I just had to say to him 
 Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel? 
 Never felt the presence of one standing by? 
 No robe of white 
 No halo in sight 
 Well you missed the most obvious thing 
 Man, are you blind? 
 Just look in your mothers eyes 
 And then I said who went through the pain 
 And smiled through the tears on the day of your birth? 
 She counted your fingers and toes and thank god you were whole 
 Son you outta know who loved you first, that's right 
 And who always came running every time you cried out 
 And how many more things have you forgotten about 
 And who tried their best to teach you wrong from right 
 And how many nights did she leave on the light 
 While she waited and prayed that you came in 
 And who'd be there for you right up to the end 
 Think about it tonight 
 Are you telling me that you've never seen an angel? 
 Never felt the presence of one standing by? 
 No robe of white 
 No halo in sight 
 Well you missed the most obvious thing 
 Aww Man, are you blind? 
 Just look in your mothers eyes 
 Aww Man, are you blind? 
 Just look in your mothers eyes 
 That's right

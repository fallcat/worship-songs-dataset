Ants on a log 
 Floatin down a river 
 Runnin' around 
 But not gettin' anywhere 
 Powerstearin wheels 
 Just ain't connected 
 And we can't jump off like flees on a dog 
 Can't fly away like flies on a hog 
 We're really just along for the ride like ants on a log 
 I got an uncle 
 He plays a game 
 Can't win it 
 He's got a mold 
 Tries to fit everybody else in it 
 When's he gonna learn he's bangin' his head on the wall? 
 He ain't gonna change 
 And he looks at me strange when I tell him 
 We're all just ants on a log 
 Floatin down a river 
 Runnin' around 
 But not gettin' anywhere 
 Powerstearin wheels 
 Just ain't connected 
 And we can't jump off like flees on a dog 
 Can't fly away like flies on a hog 
 We're really just along for the ride like ants on a log 
 We all know people 
 We yella t the cars and the traffic 
 Folks in a hurry 
 Life's full of heartache and havok 
 I finally learned how to lay back and let life happen 
 I just image 
 The angels up in heaven 
 Lookin' down at us and laughin' 
 At ants on a log 
 Floatin down a river 
 Runnin' around 
 But not gettin' anywhere 
 Powerstearin wheels 
 Just ain't connected 
 And we can't jump off like flees on a dog 
 Can't fly away like flies on a hog 
 We're really just along for the ride like ants on a log 
 And just about the time you think 
 You're rollin' in clover 
 Along comes a rabbit 
 And the world tips over 
 Ants on a log 
 Floatin down a river 
 Runnin' around 
 But not gettin' anywhere 
 Power stear wheels 
 Just ain't connected 
 And we can't jump off like flees on a dog 
 Can't fly away like flies on a hog 
 We're really just along for the ride like ants on a log 
 Yeah we're really just along for the ride like ants on a log

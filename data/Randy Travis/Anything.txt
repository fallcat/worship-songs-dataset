I'd do anything if you'd just let me hold you 
 I'd do anything to change your mind 
 I'd climb the highest mountain or swim the deepest ocean 
 Anything to make you mine 
 Anything, anytime 
 Day or night, rain or shine 
 There ain't nothin' I won't do 
 Oh, to get to you 
 Is there anything I can say to make you love me 
 Is there anything that I haven't tried 
 Well I'd take you 'round the world 
 Just to walk you down a dirt road 
 Anything to make you mine 
 Anything, anytime 
 Day or night, rain or shine 
 There ain't nothin' I won't do 
 Oh, to get to you 
 I'd give anything if I had you forever 
 I'd give anything to see that time 
 I'd walk upon my hands up the stairway to heaven 
 Anything to make you mine 
 Anything, anytime 
 Day or night, rain or shine 
 There ain't nothin' I won't do 
 Oh, to get to you 
 Anything, anytime 
 Day or night, rain or shine 
 There ain't nothin' I won't do 
 Oh, to get to you 
 I'd do anything if you'd just let me hold you 
 I'd do anything to change your mind 
 I'd climb the highest mountain or swim the deepest ocean 
 Anything to make you mine 
 I'd climb the highest mountain or swim the deepest ocean 
 Anything to make you mine

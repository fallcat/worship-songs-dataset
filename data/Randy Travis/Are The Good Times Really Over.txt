I wish a buck was still silver and it was back when the country was strong 
 Back before Elvis and before the Vietnam war came along 
 Before the Beatles and yesterday when a man could still work and still would 
 Is the best of the free life behind us now 
 And are the good times really over for good 
 Are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell 
 With no kind of chance for the flag or the liberty bell 
 I wish a Ford or a Chevy would still last ten years like they should 
 Is the best of the free life behind us now 
 And are the good times really over for good 
 I wish Coke was still cola and a joint was a bad place to be 
 It was back before Nixon lied to us all on TV 
 Before Microwave ovens when a girl could still cook and still would 
 Is the best of the free life behind us now 
 And are the good times really over for good 
 Stop rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell 
 Standup for the flag and let's all ring the liberty bell 
 Let's make a Ford and a Chevy that'll still last ten years like they should 
 The best of the free life is still yet to come 
 And the good times ain't really over for good

Wasn't just the music, wasn't just the wine 
 Some other kind of magic sending shivers up my spine 
 And I was falling and I fell for you and how 
 Darling, are we in trouble now 
 Well they say we're grown up 
 We've been searching all this time 
 And I wouldn't own up 
 Never would admit to flying blind 
 But in the darkness found each other anyhow 
 Darling, are we in trouble now 
 When we talk it over 
 Our love was crying from a distant shore 
 Then we found each other 
 And all that we've been searching for 
 Now don't deny it yeah I guess by how we know 
 I'm through with trying can't bring myself to let you go 
 And all these feelings said we never would now 
 Darling, are we in trouble now 
 Darling are we in trouble now

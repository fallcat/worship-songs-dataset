Just around the bend nobody knows 
 Still that's where everybody wants to go 
 Might be a mile right up ahead 
 All I really know is that I'm not there yet 
 When I was a child I thought as a child 
 And I had no fear of all things wild 
 Crawl turned to a walk, walk turned to a run 
 Run turned to a leap, hair in the wind 
 Taking that one step forward around the bend 
 Here I go 
 I don't know what waits but I am not afraid 
 I'll just make my own sweet way around the bend 
 See I've been alone and I've been loved 
 I've turned the other cheek, I've taken off the gloves 
 I still got the fight, still the thirst 
 I just keep on searching for better or worse 
 Here I go 
 I don't know what waits but I am not afraid 
 I'll just make my own sweet way around the bend 
 One day I'll wake on a distant shore 
 My soul someplace it's never been before 
 I don't know what waits but I am not afraid 
 I'll just make my own sweet way around the bend

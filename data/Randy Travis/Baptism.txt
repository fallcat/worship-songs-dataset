The summer breeze 
 Made ripples on the pond 
 And rattled through the reeds 
 And the willow trees boyond 
 And Daddy in his good hat 
 And Mamma in her Sunday dress 
 Watched with pride as I stood there 
 In the water up to my chest 
 And the preacher spoke 
 About the cleansing blood 
 As I sank my toes 
 Into that cool East Texas mud 
 Then it was down with the old man 
 Up with the new 
 Raised to walk in 
 The ways of light and truth 
 I didn't see no angels 
 Just a few saints on the shore 
 But I felt like a new born baby 
 Cradled up in the arms of the Lord 
 Amazing grace 
 Oh, how sweet the sound 
 There was glory in the air 
 There was dinner on the ground 
 And my sins which were many 
 Were washed away and gone 
 Along with a buffalo nickel 
 I forgot to leave at home 
 That semed like such a small 
 Small price to pay 
 For the blessed peace of mind 
 That came to me that day 
 It was down with the old man 
 Up with the new 
 Raised to walk in 
 The way of light and truth 
 I didn't see no angels 
 Just a few saints on the shore 
 But I felt like a new born baby 
 Cradled up in the arms of the Lord. 
 This road is long and dusty 
 Sometimes a soul it must be cleansed 
 And I long to feel that water 
 Rushing over me again 
 I didn't see no angels 
 Just a few saints on the shore 
 But I felt like a new born baby 
 Cradled up in the arms of the Lord 
 I felt like a new born baby 
 Cradled up in the arms of the Lord

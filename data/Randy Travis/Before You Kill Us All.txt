Must be doing something wrong baby I don't know 
 But the goldfish are floating at the top of the bowl 
 And the dog, he won't eat, he just lays around 
 All night long he makes a lonesome sound 
 I know I had it coming and it's all my fault 
 But baby come back before you kill us all 
 The way the plants are dying, you'd swear it's fall 
 Looks just like autumn up and down the hall 
 And I talk to them baby like you're supposed to do 
 But they're tired of hearing about me missing you 
 And I know you told me not to call 
 But baby come back before you kill us all 
 Well it's a desperate situation, 
 I got a strong will to survive 
 But if this place is any indication 
 I may not make it out alive 
 Well it's an eerie feeling in the still of the night 
 Knowing that the cat's down to three more lives 
 Well you've turned us all into nervous wrecks 
 We just sit around and wonder who's gonna be next 
 And I know I had it coming and it's all my fault 
 But baby come back before you kill us all 
 Baby come back before you kill us all, (baby come back) 
 Baby come back before you kill us all (baby come back) 
 (Baby come back)...

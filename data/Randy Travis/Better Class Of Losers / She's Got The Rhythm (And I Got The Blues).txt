Im getting out of this 
 High-rise penthouse suite 
 Where we pretend life's 
 Rosy and sweet 
 I'm going back to the folks 
 That I used to know 
 Where everyone is what 
 They seem to be 
 And these high-class friends 
 That you like to hang around 
 When they look my way 
 They're always looking down 
 I'm tired of spending 
 Every dime I make 
 To finance this way of life 
 I've learned to hate 
 (chorus) 
 I'm going back to a 
 Better class of losers 
 This up-town living's 
 Really got me down 
 I need friends who don't pay 
 Their bills on home computers 
 And who buy their 
 Coffee beans already ground 
 You think it's disgraceful 
 That they drink three-dollar wine 
 But a better class of 
 Losers suits me fine 
 You say the grass is 
 Greener on the other side 
 From where I stand 
 I can't see grass at all 
 And the concrete and the steel 
 Won't change the way you feel 
 It takes more than caviar 
 To have a ball 
 (chorus) 
 You think it's disgraceful 
 That they drink three-dollar wine 
 But a better class of 
 Losers suits me fine

I'm getting out of this high-rise penthouse suite 
 Where we pretend life's rosy and sweet 
 I'm going back to the folks that I used to know 
 Where everyone is what they seems to be 
 And these high-class friends that you like to hang around 
 When they look my way they're always looking down 
 I'm tired of spending every dime I make 
 To finance this way of life I've learned to hate 
 I'm going back to a better class of loser 
 This up-town living's really got me down 
 I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers 
 And who buy their coffee beans already ground 
 You think it's disgraceful that they drink three-dollar wine 
 But a better class of loser suits me fine 
 You say the grass is greener on the other side 
 From where I stand I can't see grass at all 
 And the concrete and the steel won't change the way you feel 
 It takes more than caviar to have a ball 
 I'm going back to a better class of loser 
 This up-town living's really got me down 
 I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers 
 And who buy their coffee beans already ground 
 You think it's disgraceful that they drink three-dollar wine 
 But a better class of loser suits me fine 
 You think it's disgraceful that they drink three-dollar wine 
 But a better class of loser suits me fine

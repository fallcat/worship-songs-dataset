Beyond the reef 
 Where the sea is dark and cold 
 My love has gone 
 And my dreams grow old 
 There'll be no tears 
 There'll be no regretting 
 Will she remember me 
 Will she forget? 
 I'll send a thousand flowers 
 When the trade winds blow 
 I'll send my lonely heart, 
 'Cause I love her so 
 Someday I know 
 She'll come back again to me 
 'Til then my heart will be 
 Beyond the reef 
 I'll send a thousand flowers 
 Where the trade winds blow 
 I'll send my lonely heart, 
 'Cause I love her so 
 Someday I know 
 She'll come back again to me 
 'Til then my heart will be 
 Beyond the reef...

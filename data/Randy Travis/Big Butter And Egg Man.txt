Now she wants a butter an egg man 
 From way out in the west 
 She wants somebody who's workin' all day 
 So she's got money when she wants to play 
 Now pretty clothes they'll never be mine 
 But what she told me the other day 
 I hope she don't change her mind 
 Now she wants a butter an egg man 
 A great big butter and egg man 
 From way down south

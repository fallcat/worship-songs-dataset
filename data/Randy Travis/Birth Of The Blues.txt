Oh they say some people long ago 
 Were searching for a different tune 
 One that they could croon as only they can 
 They heard the breeze in the trees 
 Singing weird melodies 
 And they made that the start of the blues 
 And from a jail came the wail 
 Of a down-hearted frail 
 And they played that as part of the blues 
 From a whippoorwill out on a hill 
 They took a new note 
 Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note 
 And then they nursed it, rehearsed it 
 And gave out the news 
 That the Southland gave birth to the blues

Blessed assurance 
 Jesus is mine 
 Oh what a foretaste 
 Of glory divine. 
 Heir of salvation 
 Purchase of God 
 Born of his spirit 
 Washed in his blood. 
 This is my story 
 This is my song 
 Praising my savior 
 All the day long. 
 This is my story 
 This is my song 
 Praising my savior 
 All the day long. 
 Perfect submission 
 All is at rest 
 I in my savior 
 Am happy and blessed 
 Watching and waiting 
 Looking above 
 Filled with his goodness 
 And lost in his love. 
 This is my story 
 This is my song 
 Praising my savior 
 All the day long. 
 This is my story 
 This is my song 
 Praising my savior 
 All the day long. 
 Praising my savior 
 All the day long

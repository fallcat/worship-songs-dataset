Blue mesa, land of the Sioux and Crow 
 Blue mesa, no matter where I go 
 You will always be home, sweet, home to me 
 Blue mesa 
 Moonlight shines as 
 Purple shadows fall 
 Silence broken by the lonesome 
 Coyote call 
 On blue mesa, land of the Sioux and Crow 
 Blue mesa, no matter where I go 
 You will always be home, sweet, home to me 
 Blue mesa 
 Herds of buffalo 
 Graze peacefully 
 I can almost hear 
 Those black hills callin' me 
 To blue mesa, land of the Sioux and Crow 
 Blue mesa, no matter where I go 
 You will always be home, sweet, home to me 
 Blue mesa 
 Ridin' high 
 Above the prairie floor 
 With every passin' day 
 I swear I love you more 
 Blue mesa, land of the Sioux and Crow 
 Blue mesa, no matter where I go 
 You will always be home, sweet, home to me 
 Blue mesa 
 Blue mesa, land of the Sioux and Crow 
 Blue mesa, no matter where I go 
 You will always be home, sweet, home to me 
 Blue mesa 
 You will always be home, sweet, home to me 
 Blue mesa

Well I'm goin' to California where they sleep out every night yeah 
 I'm goin' to California where they sleep out every night 
 I'm leaving you mama cause you know you don't treat me right. 
 Let me tell you something mama that you don't know 
 Let me tell you something good gal that you don't know 
 Well I'm a do-right papa and got home everywhere I go yeah. 
 I got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here Lawd Lawd 
 I got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here 
 I may ride the blinds I ain't got no railroad fare. 
 Listen to me mama while I sing this song 
 Listen to your daddy sing you this so lonesome song 
 You got me worried now but I won't be worried too long. 
 I got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here Lawd Lawd 
 I got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here 
 I may ride the blinds I ain't got no railroad fare

Don't mistake me for somebody, 
 You think maybe just might give a damn 
 You already think I'm crazy, 
 So come on baby, try to hurt me if you can 
 Go on and cuss me out, 
 Go on and slam that door 
 You can't throw nothin' at me, 
 I ain't see before. 
 Go on and put me down, 
 Can't fall off the floor 
 Ah, you can't hurt a man who can't feel nothin' no more 
 You can keep on tryin', 
 To see me cryin', 
 Swear I ain't lyin', 
 That well is all dried up 
 And you can cheat me, leave me, laugh right at me, 
 Knock me over if it makes yah happy 
 Girl, it's all your fault that I'm this tough 
 Go on and put me down, 
 I can't fall off the floor. 
 Ah you can't hurt a man that can't feel nothin' no more

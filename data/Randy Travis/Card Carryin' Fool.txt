It takes all kinds 
 To keep this world in place 
 It's a fragile balance 
 That let's us swing through space 
 So everybody's 
 Got their job to do 
 And girl I guess 
 The job I've got 
 Is cryin' over you 
 And I should get a gold watch 
 For all the years I gave 
 And I should get some interest now 
 For all the dues I've paid 
 I don't know why I love you, 
 It's just the job I do 
 I'm your registered, certified 
 Card carryin' fool 
 If I was in the army 
 There'd be medals that I'd get 
 If I ws in the circus, 
 At least I"d have a net 
 If I was an electrician, 
 I might could find a spark 
 And if I could be a surgeon, Girl, 
 I might could find your heart 
 But I keep bending over backwards 
 Just to be your limbo man 
 While you drop that stick another notch 
 Every chance you can 
 I don't know why I love you, 
 It's just the job I do 
 I'm your registered, certified 
 Card carryin' fool 
 Ah, if I was a gambler 
 I might have better luck 
 If I was mathematician 
 I could make it all add up 
 But when it comes down to it 
 All I want to do 
 Is be your registered, certified 
 Card carryin' fool. 
 Yeah, when it comes down to it 
 All I want to do 
 Is be your registered, certified 
 Card carryin' fool...

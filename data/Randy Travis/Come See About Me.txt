Somebody listen, I'm a voice in the distance cryin' 
 Come see about me 
 I am a stranger in a world filled with anger 
 Come see about me 
 I'm gettin' weary tryin' to carry this load all by myself 
 I'm bone tired and fallin', can't you hear me callin' 
 I need somebody's help 
 I am a young man growin' wild across this land 
 Come see about me 
 I'm fourscore and twenty and I ain't got anybody 
 Come see about me 
 I'm somebody's children alone and forsaken, 
 A wave that's lost at sea 
 I'm right here behind you, 
 I'm all around you, so slow down 
 Turn around and you will see 
 I'm your mother, your sister and your brother 
 Come see about me 
 I am a baby, my mother ain't no lady 
 Come see about me 
 I am your maker, the giver and the taker 
 Come see about me

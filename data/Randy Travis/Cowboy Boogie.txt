Well, He swings in a saddle 
 He's a real gone cat 
 With his Spanish spurs 
 And his buckaroo hat 
 His camps in an old log shack 
 Way back in the sticks. 
 He loves ta tie 'em down 
 And burn their hide 
 And there ain't no rough string 
 He can't ride 
 But cuttin' the rug is how he 
 Gets his kicks. 
 He does the cowboy boogie 
 The cowboy way 
 The cowboy boogie 
 Come a ti-i youpy, youpy yi I youpy, youpy ya. 
 So it's adios to his old payoose 
 And down the road to turn it loose 
 At an old dance hall 
 He cuts a gal now straight 
 Spins her sideways through the herd 
 He's buckin' like he's being spurred 
 Twistin' and rockin' like a bronc 
 Comin' outta the gate. 
 He does the cowboy boogie 
 The cowboy way 
 The cowboy boogie 
 Come a ti-i youpy, youpy yi I youpy, youpy ya. 
 Well, He swings in a saddle 
 He's a real gone cat 
 With his Spanish spurs 
 And his buckaroo hat 
 A tree frog walkin' fool 
 He ain't no dude 
 The Fred Astaire of hill and range 
 Two parts cool and one part strange 
 He's the best out west at any Elvis tune. 
 He does the cowboy boogie 
 The cowboy way 
 The cowboy boogie 
 Come a ti-i youpy, youpy yi I youpy, youpy ya. 
 He does the cowboy boogie 
 The cowboy way 
 The cowboy boogie 
 Come a ti-i youpy, youpy 
 A yi I youpy, youpy. 
 Come a ti-i youpy, youpy 
 A yi I youpy, youpy. 
 Come a ti-i youpy, youpy 
 Yi I youpy, youpy ya...

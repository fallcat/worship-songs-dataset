Cold house, just before dawn 
 Oh, my God, this feels so wrong 
 Clouds roll in and cover the sun 
 A new day begins, day one 
 Day one and it already feels like forever 
 It's over and done so what can I do 
 Day one of putting my life back together 
 Day one of learning to live without you 
 Gold ring, there on the bed 
 Oh, my God, she meant what she said 
 No place to hide, no where to run 
 Just dyin' inside, day one 
 Day one and it already feels like forever 
 It's over and done so what can I do 
 Day one of putting my life back together 
 Day one of learning to live without you 
 Day one of learning to live without you...

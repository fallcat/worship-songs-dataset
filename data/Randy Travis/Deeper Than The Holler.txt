Well, I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love 
 Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above 
 Well, I come from the country, and I know I ain't seen it all 
 But I heard that ocean's salty and the stars, they sometimes fall 
 And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you 
 So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew 
 My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river 
 Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill 
 My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December 
 And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill 
 And longer than the song of the whippoorwill 
 From the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between 
 There's at least a million love songs that people love to sing 
 And every one is different and every one's the same 
 So this is just another way of sayin' the same thing 
 My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river 
 Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill 
 My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December 
 And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill 
 And longer than the song of the whippoorwill 
 My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river 
 Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill 
 My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December 
 And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill 
 And longer than the song of the whippoorwill 
 A whippoorwill

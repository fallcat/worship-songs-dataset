Last night I dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer 
 I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four 
 I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of bone 
 Yeah I've been settlin' alone diggin' up bones 
 Then I went to the jewelery and I found our wedding rings 
 I've put mine on my finger and I gave yours a flame 
 I crossed this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home 
 Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones 
 Exhuming things that better left alone 
 I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones 
 And I went to the closet and I found some things in there 
 Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear 
 And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on 
 Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones 
 Exhuming things that better left alone 
 I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm diggin' up bones 
 Exhuming things that better left alone 
 I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm diggin' up bones 
 Exhuming things that better left alone 
 I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones

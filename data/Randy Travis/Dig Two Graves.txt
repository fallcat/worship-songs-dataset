I promised you, on the day we wed 
 Till death do us part, yeah that was what I said 
 But things have changed, since I made that vow 
 The love I felt for you is so much deeper now 
 So I've made up my mind 
 When the family sings, Sweat Bye and Bye 
 They might as well go on and tell us both good-bye 
 Because you've come to be my heart and soul 
 The air I breathe or reason there's life in these bones 
 So I've made up my mind, girl if it's your time 
 They can dig two graves, just carve one stone 
 Because without you here, I won't last long 
 Your love's the blood running through these veins 
 So if He calls you home, they can dig two graves 
 I'm sure the good Lord won't ask me to be that strong 
 Because it kills me just to think about you being gone 
 They can dig two graves, just carve one stone 
 Because without you here, I won't last long 
 Your love's the blood, running through these veins 
 So if He calls you home, they can dig two graves 
 Tell the Lord above, no need to wait

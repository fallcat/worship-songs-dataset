Last night, I dug your picture out from our old dresser drawer 
 I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four 
 I read some more love letters right up 'til the break of dawn 
 Yeah, I've been sittin' alone diggin' up bones 
 Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings 
 I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling 
 Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home 
 Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm diggin' up bones ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ) 
 I'm diggin' up bones ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ) 
 Exhumin' things that's better left alone 
 I'm resurrectin' mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones 
 And I went through the closet and found some things in there 
 Like that pretty négligée that I bought you to wear 
 And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on 
 Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm diggin' up bones ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ) 
 I'm diggin' up bones ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ) 
 Exhuming things that's better left alone 
 I'm resurrectin' mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones 
 I'm resurrectin' mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones 
 ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ), I'm diggin' up bones ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ) 
 Exhuming things that's better left alone 
 I'm resurrectin' mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones 
 ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ), I'm diggin' up bones ( 
 Diggin' up bones 
 ) 
 Exhuming things that's better left alone 
 I'm resurrectin' mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone 
 Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones

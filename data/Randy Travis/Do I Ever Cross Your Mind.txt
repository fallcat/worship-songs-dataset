1,2... 
 (Dolly) 
 Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked 
 Long ago in the sweet used to be 
 And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet 
 As they did when you picked them for me. 
 And when I think of you and the love we once knew 
 How I wish we could go back in time 
 Do you ever think back on old memories like that 
 Or do I ever cross your mind? 
 (Randy) 
 Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss 
 Your sweet lips like I did long ago 
 And how often I've long for those two loving arms 
 That once held me so gentle and close. 
 And when I think of you and the love we once knew 
 How I wish we could go back in time 
 Do you ever recall these old memories at all 
 Or do I ever cross your mind? 
 Well, memories clear, my eyes won't stay clear 
 When I think of those happier times 
 Do you ever recall on old memories at all 
 Or do I ever cross your mind? 
 Do you ever think back on old memories like that 
 Or do I ever cross your mind?..

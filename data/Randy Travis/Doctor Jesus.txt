You know I've got so many problems 
 And lately I've been feelin' kinda down 
 I hear You're the one I should talk to 
 I hear You're the best healer around 
 Doctor Jesus will you help me 
 Make me better, make me whole 
 Doctor Jesus, Lord, I need you 
 To mend my heart and save my soul 
 There's so many out there who need You 
 Do You think You could work me in 
 You see I'm in the worst of conditions 
 But mostly I just need me a friend 
 Doctor Jesus will you help me 
 Make me better, make me whole 
 Doctor Jesus, Lord, I need you 
 To mend my heart and save my soul 
 Doctor Jesus, Lord, I need you 
 To mend my heart and save my soul

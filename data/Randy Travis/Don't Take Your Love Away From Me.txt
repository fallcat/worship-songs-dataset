Well, I pray I'm wrong 
 But I feel you stealin away from me 
 Your heart's a-beatin' to a chain-gang song 
 Well, you just can't help it if you got be a thief 
 And steal the thunder from the sky 
 The water from the river 
 You can have the winter wind 
 It only makes me shiver 
 Take the snow off of the moutain 
 The wave off of the sea 
 Don't take your love away from me 
 Don't take your love away from me 
 Now tell the truth 
 I know you did, but do you love me now 
 One thing I've learned from a woman like you 
 It ain't safe if it ain't nailed down 
 Steal the thunder from the sky 
 The water from the river 
 You can have the winter wind 
 It only makes me shiver 
 Take the snow off of the mountain 
 The wave off of the sea 
 Don't take your love away from me 
 Don't take your love away from me 
 So steal the thunder from the sky 
 The water from the river 
 You can have the winter wind 
 It only makes me shiver 
 Take the snow off of the mountain 
 The wave off of the sea 
 Don't take your love away from me 
 Don't take your love away from me 
 Don't take your love away from me

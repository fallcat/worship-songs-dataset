Ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe 
 If you don't know by now 
 Ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe 
 It'll never do somehow 
 When your rooster crows at the break of dawn 
 Look out your window babe and I'll be gone 
 You're the reason I keep travelin' on 
 But don't think twice it's all right 
 Ain't no use in turning on your light babe 
 That light I've never known 
 Ain't no use in turning on your light babe 
 I'm on the dark side of the road 
 Wishin' there was something you could do or say 
 To try and make me change my mind and stay 
 But we never did too much talkin' anyway 
 But don't think twice it's all right 
 Ain't no use in callin' out my name now 
 Like you never done before 
 Ain't no use in callin' out my name gal 
 I can't hear you anymore 
 Walkin' and a thinkin' 
 Goin' down this road 
 I once loved a woman 
 A child I'm told 
 I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul 
 But don't think twice it's all right 
 So long honey baby 
 Where I'm bound I can't tell 
 Goodbye is just too good a word babe 
 I'll just say fare thee well 
 I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind 
 You could have done much better babe 
 But I don't mind 
 You just wasted some of my precious time 
 But don't think twice it's all right 
 Don't think twice it's all right

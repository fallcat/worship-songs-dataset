Don't worry about me it's all over now 
 Though I may be blue I'll manage some how 
 Love can't be explained can't be controlled 
 One day it's warm next day it's cold 
 Don't pity me 'cause I'm feeling blue 
 Don't be ashamed it might have been you 
 Oh oh oh oh love kiss me one time then go love 
 I'll understand don't worry about me 
 Sweet sweet sweet love I want you to be 
 As happy as I when you loved me 
 I'll never forget you your sweet memory 
 It's all over now don't worry about me 
 When one heart tells one heart one heart good-bye 
 One heart is free one heart will cry 
 Oh oh oh oh sweet sweet baby sweet baby sweet 
 It's all right don't worry about me

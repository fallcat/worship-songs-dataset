It seems no matter how far I may roam 
 Like some old tumbleweed, my thoughts go tumblin' back home 
 In memories I recall those simpler times 
 And a way of life I never left behind 
 Down at the old corral 
 Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down 
 Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now 
 Down at the old corral 
 I remember everything I ever heard 
 Like how to judge a man's true worth, by how he keeps his word 
 That saddle wisdom never seemed to end 
 Everything I need to know I learned back then 
 Down at the old corral 
 Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down 
 Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now 
 Down at the old corral 
 Down at the old corral 
 Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down 
 Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now 
 Down at the old corral 
 Down at the old corral 
 Down at the old corral

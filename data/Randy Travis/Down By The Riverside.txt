I feel so bad in the morning 
 I feel so bad in the middle of the day 
 I feel so bad in the evening 
 That's why I'm going to the river to wash my sins away 
 I'm gonna lay down my heavy load 
 Down by the riverside 
 Down by the riverside 
 Down by the riverside 
 I'm gonna lay down my heavy load 
 Down by the riverside 
 I ain't gonna study war no more 
 I ain't gonna study, no, study, no, no, no, no 
 Study, study war no more 
 I ain't gonna study, no, study, no, no, no, no 
 Study, study war no more 
 I'm gonna meet my loving mother 
 Down by the riverside 
 Down by the riverside 
 Down by the riverside 
 I'm going to meet my loving mother 
 Down by the riverside 
 I ain't gonna study war no more 
 I ain't gonna study, no, study, no, no, no, no 
 Study, study war no more 
 I ain't gonna study, no, study, no, no, no, no 
 Study, study war no more 
 I ain't gonna study, no, study, no, no, no, no 
 Study, study war no more 
 I ain't gonna to study, no, study, no, no, no, no 
 Study, study war no more 
 I ain't gonna study, study war no more

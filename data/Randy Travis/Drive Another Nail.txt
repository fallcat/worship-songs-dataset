Sam was a carpenter fifty years 
 He pounded out blood, sweat and tears 
 One day he hung his hammer up 
 He wanted to do the things he loved 
 What once was Sunday fishin' 
 Now was seven days a week 
 He told his wife "To find me 
 I'll be down at the creek" 
 'Cause I don't want to drive another nail 
 I've worked hard to do my job and I did it well 
 I've got the scars on these two hands 
 That show I haven't failed 
 But I don't want to drive another nail 
 Now she was a woman full of faith 
 And old Sam was full of pride 
 And she knew that he had one more job 
 To do before he died 
 Easter Sunday rolled around 
 In a country church for the lost and found 
 Oh, Sam was there against his will 
 As a preacher spoke on Calvary's hill 
 Of how they took the Master 
 And they nailed him to a tree 
 You could hear old Sam a cryin' 
 As he fell down on his knees 
 I don't wanna drive another nail 
 I want to live my life for you 
 I want to do it well 
 You've got the scars on your two hands 
 That show where I have failed 
 Lord, I don't want to drive another nail 
 I don't wanna drive another nail 
 I want to live my life for you 
 I want to do it well 
 You've got the scars on your two hands 
 That show where I have failed 
 Lord, I don't want to drive another nail

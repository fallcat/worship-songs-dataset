You were pure to me as fresh untraveled snow 
 Skin as soft as a petal, of an uncut rose 
 I gave you all I had 
 Everything I owned 
 Right down to the pedestal, I put you on 
 And it was so easy to love you 
 So hard to walk away. 
 Well, this morning when I woke up 
 I knew everything had changed 
 But it ain't so simple for a man 
 Whose whole world he has to rearrange 
 Said you've found something in another 
 You just couldn't find in me 
 Baby I love you so much 
 But I guess I'll have to set you free 
 And it was so easy to love you 
 So hard to walk away 
 I've been pleading with my maker 
 To ease this pain and take my pride 
 But it still feels like my heart's been laid open wide 
 My hands are shakin' as I think of all I have to do 
 My life will never be the same 
 Not like it was with you 
 Said you've found something in another 
 You just couldn't find in me 
 Well baby I love you so much 
 But I guess I'll have to set you free 
 And it was so easy to love you 
 So hard to walk away 
 Lord, it was so easy to love you 
 So hard to walk away...

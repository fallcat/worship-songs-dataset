Sunday mornin' was a fight 
 I was runnun' from a clip-on tie 
 It took Daddy's belt to get me into my Sunday best 
 Lord's Supper would go on past 
 Cracker crumbs and a little shot glass 
 I was starvin' to death 'cause I didn't know Jesus yet 
 But I was saved by a month-old Twinkle in my corduroy coat 
 When every head bowed, every eye closed 
 Amazing Grace don't make a sound 
 Or Momma's gonna wear that backside out while shoutin' hallelujah 
 If you raised your hand or came on down 
 To repent of your sins there'd be little kid starin' a hole right through ya 
 But I wasn't no angel so I wasn't gonna throw no stones 
 When every head bowed, every eye closed 
 Pass the plate and altar call 
 Every verse of "I Surrender All" 
 Squirming in my seat tummy growlin' like a grizzly bear 
 We'd hit the door when the service closed 
 Hopped in the car, burned up on the road 
 Straight to KFC 'cause we're gonna beat the Catholics there 
 While they're still confessing we were blessing our mashed potatoes 
 With every head bowed, every eye closed 
 While Daddy says grace put that fork back down 
 Or Momma's gonna wear that backside out while shoutin' hallelujah 
 I could have sworn I lost 15 pounds 
 Lust for finger-lickin' greasy fried children burns a hole right through ya 
 While Daddy's still prayin' everybody's dinner's done got cold 
 With every head bowed, every eye closed 
 Well God never struck me down 
 Guess he thought it was a pretty good show 
 With every head bowed, every eye closed

All like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like that 
 This world is not my home 
 But it's a pretty good location 
 I know life is short 
 But that's another conversation 
 So while I got the chance 
 I think I'll take the time to dance 
 And dance and dance 
 I'm gonna reach for the sky 
 Live while I'm alive 
 Like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like that 
 I'm gonna let somebody else 
 Take care of all the worry 
 Changin' my direction 
 And I won't be in a hurry 
 I'm gonna slow it down 
 While the world goes spinnin' 'round 
 And 'round and 'round 
 I'm gonna enjoy the ride 
 Live while I'm alive 
 Like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like that 
 I can't build a mountain 
 No, I can't fill up an ocean 
 No, I ain't that smart 
 I ain't that smart 
 I don't know how He did it 
 But I'm givin' God the credit 
 God, how great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 I'm gonna bait the hook 
 And let the worm do all the fishin' 
 Kick back on the bank 
 And be a man without a mission 
 I'm gonna slow it down 
 While the world goes spinnin' 'round 
 And 'round and 'round 
 I'm gonna enjoy the ride 
 Live while I'm alive 
 Like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like this 
 This world is not my home 
 But it's a pretty good location 
 I know life is short 
 But that's another conversation 
 So while I got the chance 
 I think I'll take the time to dance 
 And dance and dance 
 I'm gonna reach for the sky 
 Live while I'm alive 
 Like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like that 
 All like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like that 
 All like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like that 
 Yeah, just like that 
 All like that and everything and all 
 Everything and all like that

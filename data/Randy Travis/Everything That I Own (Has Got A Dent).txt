I drive around with the trunk tied down with a bungee cord 
 'Cause I hopped a curb, backed into her new boyfriend's Ford 
 And down the hall there's a hole in the wall that's hard to miss 
 It's about the size and shape of my right busted fist 
 Everything I own has got a dent 
 It's cracked or scratched, ripped or torn, banged up or slightly bent 
 Why should my heart be any different 
 Everything that I own has got a dent 
 She used to say I'm a man who's way too hard on stuff 
 And she let me know that that also goes for our love 
 I guess her heart's like that old dead goldfish I forgot to feed 
 And mine's like that dirt bike I wrapped around a tree 
 Everything I own has got a dent 
 It's cracked or scratched, ripped or torn, banged up or slightly bent 
 Why should my heart be any different 
 Everything that I own has got a dent 
 In the side, a hole in the back 
 A big piece of junk, ready for the trash 
 Better days gone, heart just keeps on beating away 
 Everything I own has got a dent 
 It's cracked or scratched, ripped or torn, banged up or slightly bent 
 Why should my heart be any different 
 Everything that I own, can't find one thing that don't 
 Everything that I own has got a dent

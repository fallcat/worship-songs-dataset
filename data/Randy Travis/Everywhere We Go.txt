They took Your commandments 
 Off the schoolhouse walls 
 They say it's a crime 
 To even pray within the halls 
 But bless the child that lets You in 
 And knows without a doubt 
 Once You live inside a heart, 
 They can't take You out 
 We are soldiers of the cross 
 We've been found to reach the lost 
 In city streets, down country roads 
 We take You with us everyday, 
 And everywhere we go 
 Here's to those across the land, 
 Working in a place 
 Where the boss man and the government 
 Say they can't share their faith 
 They know all too well they'll lose their job 
 If they get caught 
 But to win a soul for Jesus, 
 They will risk it all because 
 We are soldiers of the cross 
 We've been found to reach the lost 
 In city streets, down country roads 
 We take You with us everyday, 
 And everywhere we go 
 In the God of all creation, 
 We put our faith and trust 
 And give our lives to You 
 'Cause You gave Your life for us 
 We are soldiers of the cross 
 We've been found to reach the lost 
 In city streets, down country roads 
 We take You with us everyday, 
 And everywhere we go 
 Everywhere we go...

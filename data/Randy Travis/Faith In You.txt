I don't have faith in technology 
 Even though we created it 
 All this stuff just breaks down anyway 
 And you can never get it fixed 
 But I do have faith in you 
 I don't have faith in politics 
 But I do believe in the will of the people 
 I don't know much about big time religion 
 But I believe in the cross on the steeple 
 And I do have faith in you 
 And after all this time 
 The lie becomes the truth 
 We traded in our innocence 
 And sacrificed our youth 
 But you give me your love 
 The one thing I can't lose 
 You believe in me 
 And I still have faith in you 
 The more I search for my significance 
 Seems the more I disappear 
 And I wonder have I made a difference 
 In anybody's life since I've been here 
 I can hear your laughter 
 It's the sweetest sound I've ever known 
 I don't know how love happens 
 But I know I'm not alone 
 And I do have faith in you 
 And after all this time 
 Sometimes I see the truth 
 And I'm touched by your innocence 
 And now I'm not confused 
 But you give me your love 
 The one thing I can't lose 
 You believe in me 
 And I still have faith in you 
 I do have faith in you

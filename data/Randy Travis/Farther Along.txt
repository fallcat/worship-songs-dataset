Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder 
 Why it should take us all the day long 
 While there are others living about us 
 Never molested though in the wrong 
 Farther along we'll know all about it 
 Farther along we'll understand why 
 Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine 
 We'll understand it all by and by 
 When we see Jesus coming in glory 
 When He comes down from His home in the sky 
 Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion 
 We'll understand it all by and by 
 Farther along we'll know all about it 
 Farther along we'll understand why 
 Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine 
 And we'll understand it all by and by 
 We'll understand it all by and by

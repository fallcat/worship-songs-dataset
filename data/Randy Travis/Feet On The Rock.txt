Spoken: 
 Well, I wanna talk to you for a minute 
 About an old man I met 
 He said, "Boy you look in trouble 
 And I bet your life's a mess" 
 He said, "I used to have the same problem, too 
 I was way out of control 
 You know the only thing that set it right for me 
 Was a little good old rock and roll" 
 I put my feet on the rock 
 And my name on the roll 
 When it's called up yonder 
 I won't worry 'bout my soul 
 I know my home is waiting 
 And it's something to behold 
 I put my feet on the rock 
 And my name on the roll 
 I'd never heard the gospel 
 Spread like that before 
 I guess the message comes in many ways 
 Those simple words of wisdom 
 Can open heaven's door 
 So every time I get the chance I say 
 Come on and put your feet on the rock 
 And your name on the roll 
 So when it's called up yonder 
 You won't worry 'bout your soul 
 You know your home is waiting 
 And it's something to behold 
 So put your feet on the rock 
 And your name on the roll 
 Come on and put your feet on the rock 
 And your name on the roll 
 So when it's called up yonder 
 You won't worry 'bout your soul 
 You know your home is waiting 
 And it's something to behold 
 So put your feet on the rock 
 And your name on the roll 
 Come on and put your feet on the rock 
 And your name on the roll 
 So when it's called up yonder 
 You won't worry about your soul 
 You know your home is waiting 
 And it's something to behold 
 So put your feet on the rock 
 And your name on the roll 
 Now, put your feet on the rock 
 And your name on the roll

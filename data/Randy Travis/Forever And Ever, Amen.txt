You may think that I'm talkin' foolish 
 You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free 
 You may wonder how 
 I can promise you now 
 This love that I feel for you always will be 
 But you're not just time that I'm killing 
 I'm no longer one of those guys 
 As sure as I live 
 This love that I give 
 Is gonna be yours until the day that I die 
 Oh baby, I'm gonna love you forever 
 Forever and ever, amen 
 As long as old men sit and talk about the weather 
 As long as old women sit and talk about old men 
 If you wonder how long I'll be faithful 
 I'll be happy to tell you again 
 I'm gonna love you forever and ever 
 Forever and ever, amen 
 They say time takes its toll on a body 
 Makes the young girls' brown hair turn grey 
 But honey, I don't care 
 I ain't in love with your hair 
 And if it all fell out, well I'd love you anyway 
 They say that time can play tricks on a memory 
 Make people forget things they knew 
 But it's easy to see 
 It's happening to me 
 I've already forgotten every woman but you 
 Oh darlin', I'm gonna love you forever 
 Forever and ever, amen 
 As long as old men sit and talk about the weather 
 As long as old women sit and talk about old men 
 If you wonder how long I'll be faithful 
 Just listen to how this song ends 
 I'm gonna love you forever and ever 
 Forever and ever, amen 
 I'm gonna love you forever and ever 
 Forever and ever, forever and ever 
 Forever and ever, amen

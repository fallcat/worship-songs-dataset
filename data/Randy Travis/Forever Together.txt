I took you for granted 
 So many years 
 I gave you no hope 
 Broken promises and tears 
 But when I was down 
 It was you who was there 
 To pick up the pieces 
 And show me you care. 
 Forever together 
 Till death do we part 
 Forsaking all others 
 I'll give you my heart 
 Through good times 
 And bad times 
 Wherever we are 
 Foerever together 
 In each other's arms 
 You seem to know 
 What we had all along 
 And you had the love 
 And the faith to go on 
 It took some time 
 But now I realize 
 That I see it all 
 When I look in your eyes 
 Forever together 
 Till Death do we part 
 Forsaking all others 
 I give you my heart 
 Through good times 
 And bad times 
 Wherever we are 
 Forever together 
 In each other's arms 
 Forever together 
 In each other's arms...

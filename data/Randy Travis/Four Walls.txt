My Grandpa farmed for a livin', 
 Content to live the simpler kind of life. 
 My Grandma worked in the kitchen, 
 Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife. 
 They used to say that they'd got everything that they need, 
 Each mornin' they wake up: 
 Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love. 
 Here I am, ring on my finger: 
 Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up. 
 I found my rock and I plan to keep her. 
 I wish they were here to see the two of us. 
 They'd be proud to know we've got everything that we need, 
 Each mornin' we wake up: 
 Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love. 
 With the highway twice as wide, 
 And the farmland sub-divided. 
 It's good to know that some things never change. 
 I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin', 
 By those simple words of wisdom: 
 Life and love come down to just four things. 
 My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him, 
 And the way that he and Grandma looked at life. 
 And each day, I count my blessings, 
 To have that kind of love here by my side. 
 No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need, 
 Each mornin' we wake up: 
 Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love. 
 Yeah, we've got everything that we need, 
 Between the two of us: 
 Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

He tore down the work of 17 years brick by brick 
 And stone by stone 
 No hammer was swingin' cause cheatin' and drinkin' 
 Don't need no help wreckin' a home 
 Ah, but when he came back through the dust and the rubble 
 Of what he had once called his life 
 He dropped to his knees in sheer disbelief of the total destruction inside 
 There were empty closets and empty drawers 
 And a tearstained note on the kitchen floor 
 And burning memories in the fireplace 
 He waited too late to say he was wrong 
 His house was still standing but his home was gone 
 Brother, you would not believe 
 What you can see From Your Knees 
 Right then and there in an old sinner's prayer 
 He told things he'd kept in the dark 
 There was no use in lying cause the man who was listening 
 Could see every room in his heart 
 Ah, he took empty whisky bottles, little black book and all 
 To the fire she left on the grate 
 Ah, sometimes a man will change on his own 
 But sometimes I tell you it takes 
 Empty closets and empty drawers 
 And a tearstained note on the kitchen floor 
 And burning memories in the fireplace 
 He waited to late to say he was wrong 
 His house was still standing he'd fight for his home 
 Brother, you would not believe, oh you would not believe 
 What you can see from your knees

I didn't come in here to fight 
 I didn't come to ruin your night 
 I came to see the future mister me 
 I didn't come to mess things up 
 I only want to wish you luck 
 And shake the hand of the future mister me 
 I only want a chance 
 To see the man who'll be the man to please my baby 
 The one who'll lay beside you 
 And hold you just the way I used to do 
 I wanna know you're happy 
 And I wanna know he treats you like a lady 
 And if I can see you're in good hands 
 Maybe I can make it without you 
 You look so happy by his side 
 And I'm sure you'll make a lovely bride 
 And he loves you, any fool can plainly see 
 The pain is just too much for me 
 So I'll just leave and let you be 
 All alone with the future mister me 
 You'll be alone here with the future mister me...

Go, tell it on that mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 Hey go, tell it on that mountain 
 Jesus Christ is born. 
 Go, tell it on that mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 I say go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 While shepherds kept their watching 
 Over silent flocks by night 
 Behold throughout the heavens 
 There shone a holy light. 
 Go, tell it on that mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 I said go, tell it on that mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 Down in that lonely manger 
 The humble Christ was born 
 God sent to us salvation 
 Born that Christmas morn. 
 Hey go, tell it on that mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 I said go, tell it on that mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 I said go, tell it on the mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 I said go, tell it on that mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 I say go, tell it on that mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 I said go, tell it on that mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born. 
 Hey go, tell it on that mountain 
 Over the hills and everywhere 
 I said go, tell it on the mountain 
 That Jesus Christ is born.

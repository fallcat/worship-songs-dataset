God rest you merry, gentlemen, 
 Let nothing you dismay, 
 Remember Christ our Savior 
 Was born on Christmas Day; 
 To save us all from Satan's power 
 When we were gone astray. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, 
 Comfort and joy, 
 O tidings of comfort and joy! 
 From God our heavenly Father 
 A blessed angel came; 
 And unto certain shepherds 
 Brought tiding of the same; 
 How that in Bethlehem was born 
 The Son of God by name. 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, 
 Comfort and joy, 
 O tidings of comfort and joy! 
 Now to the Lord sing praises, 
 All you within this place, 
 And with true love and brotherhood 
 Each other now embrace; 
 This holy tide of Christmas 
 Doth bring redeeming grace 
 O tidings of comfort and joy, 
 Comfort and joy, 
 O tidings of comfort and joy!...

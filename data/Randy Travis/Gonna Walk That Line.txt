I never been too good at doing right 
 Done mostly wrong most all my life 
 I never found a place to settle down 
 But baby, I do believe I found it now 
 I'm gonna walk that line - gonna tote that barge 
 Gonna lift that bale - gonna work real hard 
 Doin' anything that you want me to 
 Baby I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Do anything that you want me to 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Well straight and narrow if ever was my past 
 And everlasting love never seem to last 
 I used to be a Tomcat out on the prowl 
 But baby I'm just your puppy dog now 
 I'm gonna walk that line - gonna tote that barge 
 Gonna lift that bale - gonna work real hard 
 Doin' anything that you want me to 
 Baby I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Do anything that you want me to 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you 
 Do anything that you want me to 
 Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you...

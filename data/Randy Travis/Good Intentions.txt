Mama always prayed that I'd be a better man than Daddy 
 And I determined not to let her down 
 Deserted by the man she loved 
 And left to raise four children 
 We were the local gossip of the town 
 I promised her that I'd live right 
 And not be like the others 
 But I wound up in jail on Christmas Day 
 I told her I'd be home and not to worry 'bout my brothers 
 When I got home my Mom had passed away 
 And I hear tell the road to hell 
 Is paved with good intentions 
 But Mama my intentions were the best 
 There's lots of things in my life 
 I'd just as soon not to mention 
 Looks like I turned out like all the rest 
 But Mama my intentions were the best 
 A little boy with big blue eyes 
 A-beggin' to go fishin' 
 I promised him but never took the time 
 Now they won't let me see him 
 And I sit here a-wishin' 
 Wishin' I could hold him one more time 
 And I hear tell the road to hell 
 Is paved with good intentions 
 But Mama my intentions were the best 
 There's lots of things in my life 
 I'd just as soon not to mention 
 Looks like I turned out like all the rest 
 But Mama my intentions were the best 
 But Mama my intentions were the best

Some trails are happy ones 
 Others Are blue 
 It's the way you ride that trail that counts 
 Is a happy one for you. 
 Happy trails to you 
 Until we meet again 
 Happy trails to you 
 Keep smiling until then 
 Who cares about the clouds if we're together 
 Just sing a song and bring the sunny weather 
 Happy trails to you 
 'Til we meet again 
 Who cares about the clouds if we're together 
 Just sing a song and bring on the sunny weather 
 Happy trails to you 
 'Til we meet again 
 Who cares about the clouds when we're together 
 Just sing a song and bring on the sunny weather 
 Happy trails to you 
 'Til we meet again...

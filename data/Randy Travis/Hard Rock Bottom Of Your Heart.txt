Since the day I was led to temptation 
 And in weakness did let your love down 
 I have prayed that with time and compassion 
 You'd come around 
 I keep waitin' for you to forgive me 
 And you keep sayin' you can't even start 
 And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart 
 Now this home we have built is still standin' 
 It's foundation is on solid ground 
 Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it 
 Or burn it down 
 I keep waitin' for you to forgive me 
 And you keep sayin' you can't even start 
 And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart 
 We can't just block it out, we've got to talk it out 
 Until our hearts get back in touch 
 I need your love I miss it, I can't go on like this is it 
 Hurts too much 
 I keep waitin' for you to forgive me 
 And you keep sayin' you can't even start 
 And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart 
 To the hard rock bottom of your heart

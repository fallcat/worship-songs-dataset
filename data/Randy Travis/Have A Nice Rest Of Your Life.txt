There's not a mean bone in my body 
 I never could be unkind 
 I know we're not talking 
 But there's something on my mind 
 It ain't rightteous indignation 
 I don't plan to rant or rave 
 No need for us to fight and fuss 
 I just want to say 
 Have a nice rest of your life without me 
 I'll be proud to be a part of your history 
 If it makes you happy honey 
 Keep talking bad about me 
 And have a nice rest of your life without me 
 I know you're not heartless 
 Not callous and you're not cruel 
 And I know you don't mean to 
 When you treat me like a fool 
 I believe that your good nature 
 Will emerge with someone else 
 If I can't be beside you 
 I can be beside myself.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Let your heart be light 
 From now on our troubles will be out of sight 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Make the Yule-tide gay 
 From now on our troubles will be miles away 
 Here we are as in olden days 
 Happy golden days of yore 
 Faithful friends who are dear to us 
 Gather near to us once more 
 Through the yearsÊwe'll always be together, 
 If the fates allow 
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. 
 And have yourself a merry little Christmas now 
 Here we are as in olden days 
 Happy golden days of yore 
 Faithful friends who are dear to us 
 Gather near to us once more 
 Through the yearsÊwe'll always be together, 
 If the fates allow 
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough 
 And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

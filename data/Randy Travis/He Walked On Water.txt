He wore starched white shirts, buttoned at the neck 
 And he'd sit in the shade, and watch the chickens peck 
 And his teeth were gone, but what the heck 
 I thought that he walked on water 
 Said he was a cowboy, when he was young 
 He could handle a rope, and he was good with a gun 
 And my mama's daddy was his oldest son 
 And I thought that he walked on water 
 And if the story was told, only heaven knows 
 But his hat seemed to me like an old halo 
 And though his wings, they were never seen 
 I thought that he walked on water 
 Well he tied a cord, to the end of a mop 
 And said "Son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot." 
 And I'd ride in circles, while he laughed a lot 
 Then I'd flop down beside him 
 And he was ninety years old in sixty-three 
 And I loved him and he loved me 
 And Lord, I cried the day he died 
 'Cause I thought that he walked on water 
 And if the story was told, only heaven knows 
 But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo 
 And though his wings, they were never seen 
 I thought that he walked on water 
 I thought that he walked on water

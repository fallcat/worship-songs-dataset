He's my rock, my sword, my shield 
 He's my wheel in the middle of the field 
 He's the lily of the valley 
 He's the bright and morning star 
 Makes no difference what you say 
 I'm goin' on my knees and pray 
 I'm gonna wait right here for Jesus 
 Till he comes. 
 'Cause Jesus is mine 
 I am forgiven 
 I'm holdin' his hand 
 I'm goin' to heaven 
 'Cause I found a wonderful savior 
 Who blesses me forever 
 I'm his and thank God 
 He is mine. 
 He's my rock, my sword, my shield 
 He's my wheel in the middle of the field 
 He's the lily of the valley 
 He's the bright and morning star 
 Makes no difference what you say 
 I'm goin' on my knees and pray 
 I'm gonna wait right here for Jesus 
 Till he comes.

I found myself 
 In a cross condition 
 Maybe it was her 
 Maybe it was me 
 Somethin's wrong 
 There was somethin' missin' 
 I couldn't stand to stay 
 So I had to leave 
 A half a tank of gas 
 Brought me this distance 
 Half a mind to run 
 Got me this far 
 There's a woman willin' 
 Where there ain't no witness 
 'Cept the one that lives 
 In my heart of hearts 
 My heart of hearts 
 Won't lie to me 
 It won't tell me things 
 That I can't believe 
 I better stop this thing 
 Before it starts 
 'Cause it don't feel right 
 To my heart of hearts 
 I could be tastin' 
 Stolen kisses 
 But that might 
 Tear my world apart 
 When it all comes down 
 To my wish of wishes 
 I'd have to go with 
 My heart of hearts 
 My heart of hearts 
 Won't lie to me 
 It won't tell me things 
 That I can't believe 
 I better stop this thing 
 Before it starts 
 'Cause it don't feel right 
 To my heart of hearts 
 I better stop this thing 
 Before it starts 
 'Cause it don't feel right 
 To my heart of hearts 
 My heart of hearts 
 Won't lie to me

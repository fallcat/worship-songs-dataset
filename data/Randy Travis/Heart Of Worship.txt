When the music fades and all is stripped away 
 And I simply come 
 Longing just to bring something that's of worth 
 That will bless Your heart 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 For a song in itself is not what You have required 
 You search much deeper within 
 Through the way things appear 
 You're looking into my heart 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it 
 When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus 
 King of endless worth, no one could express 
 How much You deserve 
 Though I'm weak and I'm poor 
 All I have is Yours, every single breath 
 I'll bring You more than a song 
 For a song in itself is not what You have required 
 You search much deeper within 
 Through the way things appear 
 You're looking into my heart 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it 
 When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it 
 When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

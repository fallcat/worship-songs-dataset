If I'd have been all you ever wanted 
 I wonder how much better I'd be 
 And I know you think it's over 
 'Cause you're so far away 
 But darlin' you're still here with me 
 And I will hold you always 
 No matter how far we're apart 
 You could be anywhere in the world, tonight 
 But I'd still have you here in my heart 
 I don't try to forget you, don't cry over regrets 
 And I always know right where you are 
 So I'll be happy just to hold you 
 Here in my heart 
 'Til I have you back in my arms 
 And I will hold you always 
 No matter how far we're apart 
 You could be anywhere in the world, tonight 
 And I'd still have you here in my heart 
 Darlin' you could be anywhere in the world, tonight 
 And I'd still have you here in my heart...

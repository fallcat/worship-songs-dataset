I ain't lived forever, but I've lived enough 
 I've learned to be gentle, and I've learned to be tough 
 I've found only two things that last 'til the end 
 One is your heroes, the other's your friends 
 Your heroes will help you find good in yourself 
 Your friends won't foresake you for somebody else 
 They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin 
 That's how it goes with heroes and friends 
 I grew up with cowboys I watched on TV 
 My friends and I sometimes pretended to be 
 Years have gone by, but now and again 
 My heart rides the range with my heroes and friends 
 Your heroes will help you find good in yourself 
 Your friends won't foresake you for somebody else 
 They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin 
 And that's how it goes with heroes and friends 
 And that's how it goes with heroes and friends

High in a tree on the top of the hill 
 By the light of the lonesome ol' moon 
 I hear the call of a lone whipporwill 
 Singing his mournful tune. 
 Way off in the night blows the long freight train 
 With a roar and a ramble of wheels 
 My poor heart is breaking with every refrain 
 'Cause it sounds just like the way I feel. 
 And it's high lonesome 
 High lonesome, heartbroken and blue 
 High lonesome 
 Lil' darling, I'm lonesome for you. 
 Do you ever get weary roamin' around 
 Do you think of the sweet love we knew 
 Do you ever get lonesome the way I am now 
 Lil' darling I'm lonesome for you. 
 And it's high lonesome 
 High lonesome heartbroken and blue 
 It's a high lonesome 
 Lil' darling I'm lonesome for you. 
 It's high lonesome 
 Lil' darling I'm lonesome for you...

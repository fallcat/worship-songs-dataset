A hundred cups of coffee, 
 Five hundred cigarettes 
 A thousand miles of highway 
 And I ain't forgot her yet 
 But I keep on moving, 
 I keep moving down the line 
 There ain't nothing in my mirror, 
 Just a cloud of dust and smoke 
 But what do you expect when 
 Some old trucker's heart gets broke 
 Yeah, trucker's hearts gets broke 
 But them big wheels of rubber 
 Are gonna rub her off my mind 
 I'm a highway junkie, 
 I need that old white line 
 Ten miles out of Nashville, 
 I was doing a hundred and one 
 State boy me over and he said, 
 "Where's the fire, son?" 
 He said, "Where's the fire son?" 
 I said "man, there ain't no fire, 
 I'm just running from a flame 
 Go on and write your ticket, 
 But I ain't the one to blame" 
 That county judge tried to rob me blind. 
 But them big wheels of rubber 
 Are gonna rub her off my mind 
 I'm a highway junkie, 
 I need that old white line 
 So I rolled on down to memphis 
 I had nothing left to lose 
 I wanted to hear some rock and roll, 
 But all they played was blues 
 I didn't wanna hear no blues 
 So I went to call up Elvis 
 And Roger Miller grabbed the phone 
 He said drive that 18 wheeler, boy, 
 You're the king of the road 
 Said I was the king of the road 
 But them big wheels of rubber 
 Are gonna rub her off my mind 
 I'm a highway junkie, 
 I need that old white line 
 I'm a highway junkie, 
 I need that old white line...

Dirt road in the twilight 
 Woods so cool and dark 
 Up ahead pale neon 
 Some where a dog barks 
 Honky tonk moon 
 Keeps shining on my baby and me 
 Breaking up the pool balls 
 Chalking up the cues 
 Jukebox pumping softly 
 Lazy summer blues 
 Honky tonk moon 
 Keep shining on my baby and me 
 Through the blue smoky haze 
 All through the day 
 Troubles seem to melt away 
 My heart's on a roll 
 I'm easy in my soul 
 There's no hurry, no worry 
 Things are going my way 
 My arms around my baby 
 Shuffling on the floor 
 Cigarettes and sawdust 
 Squeaky old screen door 
 Honky tonk moon 
 Keep shining on my baby and me 
 Through the blue smoky haze 
 All through the day 
 Troubles seem to melt away 
 My heart's on a roll 
 I'm easy in my soul 
 There's no hurry, no worry 
 Things are going my way 
 Outside the dark has fallen 
 Stars are winking bright 
 An old hoot owl is calling 
 Everything's all right 
 Honky tonk moon 
 Keep shining on my baby and me

Don't you cry don't you moan 
 Hang your head down all night long 
 That ole feeling sure ain't nothing new 
 It's in your walk, it's in your talk 
 There's only one way to shake it off, 
 You got to get to it before it gets to you 
 So Put a quarter in that jukebox, let it drop 
 Put another one in, play it again, don't let it stop 
 There's only one thing I've found 
 That'll turn it all around 
 The blues can't do no business 
 On a honky tonk side of town 
 You gotta slip, you gotta slide 
 There're gonna try to nail your hide 
 Yeah, they'll put a hurting on you, given half a chance 
 So get mean and get slick 
 You gotta pull out every trick 
 Cause everybody knows the blues don't like to dance 
 Well, you can walk that walk 
 And talk that talk, and boogie till you shake it off 
 No the blues can't do no business 
 The blues can't do no business 
 The blues can't do no business 
 On the honky tonk side of town

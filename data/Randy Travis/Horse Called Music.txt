High on a mountain in western Montana 
 A silhouette moves 'cross a cinnamon sky 
 Ridin' alone on a horse he called Music 
 With a song on his lips, and a tear in his eye 
 He dreams of a time, and a lady that loved him 
 And how he would sing her, sweet lullabies 
 But we don't ever ask him and he never talks about her 
 I guess it's better that we just let it slide 
 But sang "ooh" to the ladies 
 And ooh, he made some sigh 
 Now he rides away on a horse he calls Music 
 With a pain in his heart, and a tear in his eye 
 He rode the Music from 
 Boston 
 to 
 Bozeman 
 For not too much money, but way to much ride 
 But those were the days when a horse he called Music 
 Could jump through the moon and sail across the sky 
 Now all that's left, is a time-old worn cowboy 
 With nothin' more, than the sweet by-and-by 
 And trailing behind, is a horse with no rider 
 A horse he calls Memories, that she used to ride 
 And he sang "ooh" to the ladies 
 And ooh, he damn near made some fall right down and die 
 Now he rides away, on a horse he called Music 
 With a pain in his heart, and a tear in his eye 
 High on a mountain in western Montana 
 Two crosses cut, through a cinnamon sky 
 Marking the place, where a horse he called Music 
 Lays with a cowboy, in the sweet by-and-by

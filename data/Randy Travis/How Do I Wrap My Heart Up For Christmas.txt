Silver bells are ringing 
 Carolers are singing 
 Snowflakes drifting through the air 
 Everybody shopping 
 Got no time for stopping 
 It looks like Christmas is here 
 (So tell me) 
 How do I wrap my heart up for christmas? 
 I want to give it to you 
 Pretty bows and ribbons 
 Won't fit the gift I'm givin' 
 Your loving arms will have to do 
 At first I thought of giving you a pretty golden ring 
 Wore myself out shopping for a million other things 
 Finally decided on something you can't buy 
 But how will I disguise it so you will be surprised? 
 How do I wrap my heart up for christmas? 
 I want to give it to you 
 Pretty bows and ribbons 
 Won't fit the gift I'm givin' 
 Your loving arms will have to do 
 The gift of love was given to the world so long ago 
 Lying in a manger he was wrapped in swaddling clothes 
 Every year we celebrate and thank the Lord above 
 And give to one another our little gifts of love 
 How do I wrap my heart up for christmas? 
 I want to give it to you 
 Pretty bows and ribbons 
 Won't fit the gift I'm givin' 
 Your loving arms will have to do

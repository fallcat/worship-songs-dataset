O Lord my God 
 When I in awesome wonder 
 Consider all the worlds 
 They hands have made 
 I see the stars 
 I hear the rollin' thunder 
 Thy power throughout 
 The universe displayed. 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God, to Thee, 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art! 
 When Christ shall come 
 With shouts of acclamation 
 And take me home 
 What joy shall fill my heart 
 Then I shall bow 
 In humble adoration 
 And there proclaim, 
 "My God, how great Thou art!" 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God, to Thee, 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art 
 Then sings my soul 
 My Savior God, to Thee 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art! 
 How great Thou art 
 How great Thou art!

Lovely hula hands, graceful as a bird in motion 
 Riding like the dove over the ocean, lovely hula hands 
 Kah Li ma na ni'ea 
 Lovely hula hands, telling of the rain in the valleys 
 And the swirling winds over Na' Pali, lovely hula hands 
 Kah Li ma na ni'ea 
 I can feel the soft caresses of your hula hands, 
 Your lovely hula hands 
 Every little move expresses, 
 So I'll understand all the tender meanings 
 Of your hula hands, fingertips that say Aloha 
 Say to me again I love you, lovely hula hands 
 Kah Li ma na ni'ea 
 I can feel the soft caresses of your hula hands, 
 Your lovely hula hands 
 Every litte move expresses, 
 So I'll understand all the tender meanings 
 Of your hula hands, fingertips that say Aloha 
 Say to me again I love you, lovely hula hands 
 Kah Li ma na ni'ea...

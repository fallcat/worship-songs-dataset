I am going where I've never been 
 I am going where there's no sin 
 There I will join my Lord and friend 
 Yes I am going where I've never been 
 Don't be crying those bitter tears 
 Don't be crying 'cause I'm not here 
 I'll be happy the first time in years 
 So don't be crying those bitter tears 
 I have travelled life's weary highway 
 And my last journey is at hand 
 I can hear the angels calling 
 And I am going where I've never been 
 I have travelled life's weary highway 
 Now my last journey is at hand 
 I can hear the angels calling 
 And I am going where I've never been 
 Yes I am going where I've never been

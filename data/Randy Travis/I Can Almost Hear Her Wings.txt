Many nights, I've stood here by this window 
 Wondering if I'd always be alone 
 No one here to share this lonely bedroom 
 But that was long before she came along 
 Heaven only knows she's not an angel 
 But I was blessed the day she came to me 
 And when I close my eyes and lay beside her 
 I'll swear I can almost hear her wings 
 I never stopped to watch an evening sunset 
 Or tired to count the stars up in the sky 
 I never knew the world held so much beauty 
 Until I saw it through my baby's eyes 
 Heaven only knows she's not an angel 
 But I was blessed the day she came to me 
 And when I close my eyes and lay beside her 
 I'll swear I can almost hear her wings 
 And when I close my eyes and lay beside her 
 I'll swear I can almost hear her wings...

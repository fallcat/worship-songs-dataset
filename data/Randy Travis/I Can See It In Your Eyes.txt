The first time I saw you 
 I felt weak inside 
 I searched my heart and mind 
 For words I couldn't find 
 Somehow you seemed to see 
 What came over me that night 
 As a love began to grow 
 That would last for all time 
 And you said, 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 They're the windows to your soul 
 Sometimes they say more 
 Than words could ever hold 
 We could wait a thousand lifetimes 
 And never feel like this again 
 But when you look at me that way 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 Later on I asked your hand 
 And I prayed the time was right 
 I knelt down on one knee 
 And said would you be my bride? 
 And the sound of silence 
 Filled the air 
 As your tears fell with mine 
 You didn't have to say a word 
 For me to realize 
 And I said, 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 They're the windows to your soul 
 I see dreams come alive 
 And future plans unfold 
 I could wait a thousand lifetimes 
 And not find a perfect love again 
 But when you look at me that way 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 Many years have come and gone 
 And what a life we've made 
 How again we search for words 
 As the heart inside me breaks 
 Until death do we part 
 Were the vows we made 
 And now the time has come 
 But goodbye is so hard to say 
 I can see it your eyes 
 They're the windows to your soul 
 The light of life is burning low 
 Soon you're leaving me I know 
 The time that's left is precious dear 
 So please don't shed another tear 
 You don't have to say a word 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 I've heard you say a thousand times 
 I'll love you dear until I die 
 But you don't have to say a word 
 I can see it in your eyes

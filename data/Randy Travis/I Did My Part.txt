I did my part, I tried my best 
 I gave my heart, I took no rest 
 Time will tell, if I left my mark 
 But I'll know full well, I did my part. 
 When I look down that road 
 What do I see? 
 My children's, children looking 
 Right back at me. 
 When they look back at me, and I'm 
 Long gone away 
 Will they think kindly of me 
 When they hear me say. 
 I did my part, I tried my best 
 I gave my heart, I took no rest 
 Time will tell, if I left my mark 
 But I'll know full well, I did my part. 
 When I look down that hall 
 What do I see? 
 A little baby crawling 
 Right back to me. 
 I cannot walk for him 
 I cannot run 
 But I can hold his hand 
 And show him how it's done. 
 I'll do my part, I'll try my best 
 I'll give my heart, I'll take no rest 
 Time will tell, if I left my mark 
 But I'll know full well, I did my part. 
 Build a family, build a city 
 Build a country, build a world. 
 Time will tell, if I left my mark 
 But I know full well, I did my part. 
 I know full well, I did my part...

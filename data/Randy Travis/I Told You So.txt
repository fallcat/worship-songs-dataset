Suppose I called you up tonight, and told you that I love you 
 And suppose I said I want to come back home 
 And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson 
 And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone 
 If I told you that I realize you're all I ever wanted 
 And it's killin' me to be so far away 
 Would you tell me that you love me too, and would we cry together 
 Or would you simply laugh at me and say 
 I told you so, oh I told you so 
 I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in 
 I told you so, but you had to go 
 And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again 
 If got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever 
 Would you get down on yours too and take my hand 
 Would we get that old-time feelin', would we laugh and talk for hours 
 The way we did when our love first began 
 Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely 
 And you've waited for the day that I return 
 And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only 
 Or would you say the table's finally turned 
 Would you say I told you so, oh I told you so 
 I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in 
 I told you so, but you had to go 
 And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again 
 And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

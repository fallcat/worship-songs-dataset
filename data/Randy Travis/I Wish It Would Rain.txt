It's the last thing I needed 
 On a star-filled night 
 The one who broke my heart 
 Comin' into sight 
 Walkin' hand-in-hand with the one who holds her now 
 I feel the hurt returning and if only somehow 
 I wish it would rain 
 I wish it would rain 
 Oh, Lord 
 So she won't see 
 What she's doin' to me 
 Come on, now, sky 
 Be a friend to these eyes 
 And I know that I 
 Can't hold back the pain 
 I wish it would rain 
 It's been too long now 
 To hurt me so bad 
 But the love that we shared 
 Was the best that I've had 
 And my tear drops will fall 
 When they go walkin' by 
 There's no place to turn 
 And no place to hide 
 I wish it would rain 
 I wish it would rain 
 Oh, Lord 
 So she won't see 
 What she's doing to me 
 Come on, now, sky 
 Be a friend to these eyes 
 I know that I 
 Can't hold back the pain 
 I wish it would rain 
 I know that I 
 Can't hold back the pain 
 I wish it would rain...

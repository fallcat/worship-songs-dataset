You're my always and forever 
 You're the one that hung the moon 
 After all these nights together 
 I still get lost in your perfume 
 And if I could write a love song 
 Every line would tell the truth 
 It would be a warm and soft one 
 And my heart would say to you 
 When you see me walk on water 
 When the sea don't reach the shore 
 When the fires of hell freeze over 
 I won't need you anymore 
 Oh the feelings lay so easy 
 Lying here the way we are 
 No one else could ever hold me 
 Like the heavens hold the stars 
 When you see me walk on water 
 When the sea don't reach the shore 
 When the fires of hell freeze over 
 I won't need you anymore 
 I won't need you anymore

Once upon a time in our life 
 We held the key to every door 
 And I that I desired 
 Was you forever more 
 I found love in a heart 
 Once broken far beyond repair 
 And you restored a sole 
 That had forgotten how to care 
 Everything we needed 
 Was at our beckon call 
 With you and I together 
 We could conquer all 
 When I needed badly 
 To be cheered up for a while 
 You were there 
 And all you had to do was simply smile 
 And holding things together 
 Was so easy for us to do 
 For you could turn to me for help 
 And I could turn to you 
 And jealousy was something 
 That never entered our hearts 
 For we were made for one another 
 No matter where we are 
 When things were at there darkest 
 I could hold you next to me 
 And I knew all would be okay 
 For you were strong and I was weak 
 So given every chance for me 
 To start my life anew 
 There'd be no question 
 I'd do it all again with you

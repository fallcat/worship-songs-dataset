I wake up to the silence 
 In a room where I once heard "Good Morning Dear" 
 I never thought I'd miss the early mornin' smell 
 Of hairspray in the air 
 All the little things I used to take for granted 
 Now I miss them most of all 
 Ain't it funny how a woman walkin' out the door 
 Can bring a man to crawl 
 And I'd surrender all 
 To bring you back to me 
 Give up everything I own 
 Get down on my hands and knees 
 Just to hear the phone 
 Ringin' down the hall 
 Oh, If you would only call 
 I'd surrender all 
 Now I'm starin' out the window 
 Prayin' every passin' car would bring you home 
 So I could take you in my arms 
 And give the kind of love you should have known 
 And I'd surrender all 
 To bring you back to me 
 Give up everything I own 
 Get down on my hands and knees 
 Just to hear the phone 
 Ringin' down the hall 
 Oh, If you would only call 
 I'd surrender all

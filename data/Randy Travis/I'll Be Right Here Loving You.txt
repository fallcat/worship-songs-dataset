Politicians, coalitions, unionism, opposition 
 Activism, communism skepticism, new vision 
 Down with the old tradition 
 Vandalism, terrorism, ammunition, demolition 
 Darwinism, religion, a lot of people 
 Making catastrophic predictions 
 But, I'll be right here loving you 
 Come what may I know this much is true 
 Long as this world's spinnin' 
 Like it's suppose to do 
 I'll be right here loving you 
 Computerize, organize, down size, enterprise 
 Idolize, criticize, demoralize, sympathize 
 Talk sweet and tell 'em lies 
 Economics, electronics, atomic, supersonic 
 Savin' whales, crowded jails, 
 America On-line, Internet, e-mail 
 I'll be right here loving you 
 Come what may I know this much is true 
 Long as this world's spinnin' 
 Like it's suppose to do 
 I'll be right here loving you 
 Ecology, technology, energy, psychology 
 Evolution, revolution, 
 Everybody trying to find a new solution 
 But I'll be right here loving you 
 Come what may I know this much is true 
 Long as the world's spinnin' 
 Like it's suppose to do 
 I'll be right here loving you 
 Long as this world's spinnin' 
 Like it's suppose to do 
 I'll be right here loving you

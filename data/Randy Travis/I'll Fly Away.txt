Some glad morning when this life is o're 
 I'll fly away 
 To a home on God's celestial shore 
 I'll fly away (I'll fly away) 
 I'll fly away, Oh Glory, I'll fly away 
 When I die Hallelujah, by and by, 
 I'll fly away (in the morning) 
 When the shadows of this life have gone 
 I'll fly away 
 Like a bird from prison bars have flown 
 I'll fly away (I'll fly away) 
 Just a few more weary days and then 
 I'll fly away 
 To a land where joy will never end 
 I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

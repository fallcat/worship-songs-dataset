Most of my life I've almost been a winner 
 I've come so close but never really won 
 Just when I thought I'd finally made it 
 I find myself back where I started from 
 I hate to say I'm giving up but I believe 
 Losing's just become a way of life for me 
 Losing wouldn't be so bad at all 
 But I'm always on a mountain when I fall 
 Then you came along and had me had me believing 
 For once in my life my luck had finally changed 
 And now you say you're gonna leave me 
 Seems everything I do winds up the same 
 I hate to say I'm giving up but I believe 
 Losing's just become a way of life for me 
 Losing wouldn't be so bad at all 
 But I'm always on a mountain when I fall 
 Losing wouldn't be so bad at all 
 But I'm always on a mountain when I fall

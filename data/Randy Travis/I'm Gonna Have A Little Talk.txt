I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 When I get home tonight 
 Gonna tell him all about my troubles 
 And I know he'll make them right 
 Then I'll ask him to forgive me 
 For the things that I've done wrong 
 Gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 Tonight when I get home 
 This world can be a struggle 
 Just livin' day to day 
 You'll run into the devil 
 With every step you take 
 I seen his face a hundred times 
 As he tried to lead me wrong 
 He don't understand 
 That I don't walk this road alone 
 I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 When I get home tonight 
 Gonna tell him all about my troubles 
 And I know he'll make them right 
 Then I'll ask him to forgive me 
 For the things that I've done wrong 
 Gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 Tonight when I get home 
 Lord said I could call on him 
 When ever I feel low 
 Any time or place I needed him 
 He would gladly go 
 My life has not been perfect 
 No matter how I try 
 But he's never turned his back on me 
 And that's the reason why 
 I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 When I get home tonight 
 Gonna tell him all about my troubles 
 And I know he'll make them right 
 Then I'll ask him to forgive me 
 For the things that I've done wrong 
 Gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 Tonight when I get home 
 I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 When I get home tonight 
 Gonna tell him all about my troubles 
 And I know he'll make them right 
 Then I'll ask him to forgive me 
 For the things that I've done wrong 
 Gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 Tonight when I get home 
 I'm Gonna have a little talk with Jesus 
 Tonight when I get home

The sun comes up, you're still gone 
 The world goes round, and life goes on 
 But life is short, and love is long 
 And when the sun goes doen, you're still gone 
 Now ain't it strange, how we make things right 
 We think things change, overnight 
 But then the sun comes up, and the night moves on 
 And I'm still here, you're still gone 
 I guess I missed the point 
 I thought I was doin' right 
 I'd get up early in the mornin' 
 And work into the night 
 I was always makin' money 
 I shoulda' been makin' love 
 Now the man I am today knows 
 That money ain't enough 
 But if I had the chance, to give one more thing 
 It wouldn't be a rose or a diamond ring 
 'Cause you showed me, where I went wrong 
 'Cause I'm still here, and you're still gone 
 Hey, I guess I missed the point 
 I thought I was doin' right 
 I'd get up early in the mornin' 
 And work into the night 
 I was always makin' money 
 I shoulda' been makin' love 
 Now the man I am today knows 
 That money ain't enough 
 The sun comes up, and you're still gone 
 The world goes round, and life goes on 
 And you showed me, where I went wrong 
 'Cause I'm still here, you're still gone 
 Yes, I'm still here, and you're still gone...

If you want someone 
 Who'll always do his best 
 Who'll understand 
 Look no farther 
 Than across this room we're in 
 If you want someone 
 Who'll always stand by you 
 No matter where or when 
 I'm your man 
 Honey I'm your man 
 If you need someone 
 To hold you when the storms start closing in 
 Someone who'll protect you 
 Or walk with you hand in hand 
 If you think you'd like to be adored forever 
 By your best friend 
 I'm your man 
 Honey I'm your man 
 I thank god each day 
 For giving us each other 
 And for making dreams reality 
 By bringing us together 
 So if you want someone 
 Who'll love you now and forever 
 And be your best friend 
 I'm your man 
 Honey I'm your man 
 I'm your man 
 Honey I'm your man

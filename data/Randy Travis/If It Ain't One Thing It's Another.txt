I got up this morning tried to get off of work 
 I couldn't even find not one clean shirt 
 There was no hot water when I jumped in the shower 
 I know my boss is gonna dock me an hour 
 The older I get the more I discover 
 If it ain't one thing, it's another 
 I got the car, I tried to get motivated 
 Now I'm stuck in the traffic, all I'm doing is waiting 
 The fool behind me keeps blowin' his horn 
 I got my top laid back and it's coming up a storm 
 The older I get the more I discover 
 If it ain't one thing, it's another 
 Light bill phone bill water and gas 
 Pay day comes and it goes so fast 
 There's no way out and I'm telling you brother 
 If it ain't one thing, it's another 
 I got to the job and I tried to explain 
 The boss said you won't have to do that again 
 I called home just to tell her the news 
 She said bye bye baby I'm leaving you 
 She took the kids and she's gone to her mother's 
 If it ain't one thing, it's another 
 Light bill phone bill water and gas 
 Pay day comes and it goes so fast 
 There's no way out and I'm telling you brother 
 If it ain't one thing, it's another 
 If it ain't one thing, it's another...

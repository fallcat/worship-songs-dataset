By my grandfather's bed, 
 My mother is reading, 
 Psalm 62, God is our refuge, 
 My grandfather stirs, could it be, 
 He is waking, one final time, 
 He has something to say, 
 If you only knew what lies awaiting 
 If you could only see what I can see 
 If you could only hear the music playing 
 The angels singing sweet victory 
 Oh, if you only knew, if you only knew, 
 How much he loves you 
 By my grandfather's bed, 
 My mother is broken, 
 Psalm 17, O God I call on you, 
 She doesn't want to hear 
 Any words about leaving 
 My grandfather says 
 "Fear not, this is my time, 
 And into his presence I'll fly" 
 If you only knew what lies awaiting 
 If you could only see what I can see 
 If you could only hear the music playing 
 The angels singing sweet victory 
 Oh, if you only knew, if you only knew, 
 How much he loves you 
 If you only knew, if you only knew, 
 How much he loves you...

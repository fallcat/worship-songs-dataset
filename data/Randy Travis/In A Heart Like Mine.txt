In a heart like mine 
 With a steady beat 
 Just the right rhythm makes you feel complete 
 And the rhythm's right with you and I 
 And love starts pounding in a heart like mine 
 Put a quart or two 
 With a melody 
 Bring in a little chillbump harmony 
 Then let it build 
 Till the feelings right 
 And love starts playing in heart like mine 
 In a heart like mine 
 In a love like this 
 There's a symphony in a single kiss 
 Bring on the fiddles and the violins 
 And listen to the way they shine 
 I could live on the music till the end of time 
 With a love like yours and a heart like mine 
 In a heart like mine 
 Thre's poetry 
 In truth, emotion and honesty 
 So when the soul is there 
 And the words all rhyme 
 Love starts singing in a heart like mine 
 In a heart like mine 
 In a love like this 
 There's a symphony in a single kiss 
 Bring on the fiddles and the violins 
 And listen to the way they shine 
 I could live on the music till the end of time 
 With a love like yours and a heart like mine 
 In a heart like mine 
 In a love like this 
 There's a sympony in a single kiss 
 Bring on the fiddles and the violins 
 And listen to the way they shine 
 I could live on the music till the end of time 
 With a love like yours and a heart like mine 
 I could live on the music till the end of time 
 With a love like yours and a heart like mine

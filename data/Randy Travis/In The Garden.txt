I come to the garden alone 
 While the dew is still on the roses 
 And the voice I hear falling on my ear 
 The son of God discloses. 
 And he walks with me and he talks with me 
 And he tells me I am his own 
 And the joy we share as we tarry there 
 None other has ever known. 
 He speaks and the sound of his voice 
 Is so sweet the birds hush their singing 
 And the melody that he gave to me 
 Within my heart is ringing. 
 And he walks with me and he talks with me 
 And he tells me I am his own 
 And the joy we share as we tarry there 
 None other has ever known...

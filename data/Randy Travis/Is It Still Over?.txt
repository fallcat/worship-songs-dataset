Being without you has turned out to be so inconvienent 
 And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time 
 You been gone so long that it's hard to recall just how the dream went 
 And all but this broken heart and me I guesss is doing' fine 
 Is it still over are we still through 
 Since my phone still ain't ringing 
 I assume it still ain't you 
 I'VE haLF to mind to take the time to find somebody new 
 But I'm not TOO sure that I'm still over you 
 That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions 
 It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth 
 And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of PURE prevention 
 And trying to explain while I'm insane is the hardest thing I've ever tried to 
 Do 
 If I repeat myself it's 'cause I've nothing else to do 
 But I'm not sure that I'm still over you

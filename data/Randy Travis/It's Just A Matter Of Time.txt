Someday, someway 
 You'll realize that you've been blind 
 Yes Darlin', you're gonna need me again 
 It's just a matter of time 
 Go on, go on 
 'Til you've reached the end of the line 
 'Cause I know, you'll pass my way again 
 It's just a matter of time 
 After I gave you, everything I had 
 You laughed and called me a clown 
 Remember, in your search, for fortune and fame 
 What goes up, must come down 
 I know, I know 
 That one day you'll wake up and find 
 That my love, is a true love 
 It's just a matter of time 
 Spoken 
 : 
 Someday, and someway 
 Girl, you'll realize that you've been blind 
 Yes, darlin', I know you're gonna need me again 
 It's just a matter of time 
 After I gave you, everything I had 
 You laughed and you called me your clown 
 But remember, in your search, for fortune and fame 
 What goes up, must come down 
 I know, I know 
 That one day you'll wake up and find 
 That my love, was a true love 
 It's just a matter, of time

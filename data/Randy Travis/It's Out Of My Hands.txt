I'll just turn away, there's not need to watch her leaving 
 I don't want to let her see me cry 
 And the part of me that's breaking 
 Is The part that has been taking her for granted 
 And that's why she said goodbye 
 I twas me that let her down and left her lonely 
 But her leaving me was never in my plan 
 It started with my lying 
 And it ended with me crying 
 And she's taken all the lonely she can stand 
 It's out of my hands now 
 It's over and done 
 She's made her choice now 
 And I'm not the one 
 She'll find her future with some other man 
 It was all up to me but I just couldn't see 
 Now it's out of my hands. 
 She tried every way she knew to make me happy 
 She was more than just a lover and a friend 
 I was just too blind to see 
 And now she set me free 
 So it's best to walk away and let it end 
 It's out of my hands now 
 It's over and done 
 She's made her choice now 
 And I'm not the one 
 She'll find her future with some other man 
 It was all up to me but I just couldn't see 
 Now it's out of my hands.

Can you hear Jerusalem's cry 
 Can you see the storm on the rise 
 Look around you can't deny 
 This is the hour of heaven's time 
 Armies gather in the East 
 For the war that's soon to come 
 Death will march with the mark, of the beast 
 So seek the Light and walk with the Son 
 Soon we'll see His wrath come down 
 And the Lord descending from the sky 
 When you hear the trumpets sound 
 God has answered Jerusalem's cry 
 When the sun goes black 
 And the moon blood red 
 And the stars fall from the sky 
 The word of God in the bible says 
 We're living in the end times. 
 Soon we'll see His wrath come down 
 And the Lord descending from the sky 
 When you hear the trumpets sound 
 God has answered Jerusalem's cry. 
 God has answered Jerusalem's cry. 
 Soon the dead in Christ will rise 
 And join Him in he sky 
 Even unbelivers will see 
 God has answered Jerusalem's cry 
 God has answered Jerusalem's cry...

Joy to the World, the Lord has come! 
 Let earth receive her King 
 Let every heart prepare Him room 
 And Heaven and nature sing 
 And Heaven and nature sing 
 And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing 
 Joy to the World, the Savior reigns 
 Let men their songs employ 
 While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat the sounding joy 
 Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy 
 He rules the world with truth and grace, 
 And makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness 
 And wonders of His love, 
 And wonders of His love, 
 And wonders, wonders, of His love. 
 Joy to the World, the Lord has come! 
 Let earth receive her King 
 Let every heart prepare Him room 
 And Heaven and nature sing 
 And Heaven and nature sing 
 And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing 
 And Heaven and nature sing 
 And Heaven and nature sing 
 And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

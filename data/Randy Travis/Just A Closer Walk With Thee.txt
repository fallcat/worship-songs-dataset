I am weak but Thou art strong 
 Jesus keep me from all wrong 
 I'll be satisfied as long as I walk 
 Dear Lord, close to Thee. 
 Just a closer walk with Thee 
 Grant it Jesus, is my plea 
 Daily walkin' close to Thee 
 Let it be, dear Lord, let it be. 
 Through this world of toils and snares 
 If I falter Lord, who cares? 
 Who with me my burden shares? 
 None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee. 
 Just a closer walk with Thee 
 Grant it Jesus, is my plea 
 Daily walkin' close to Thee 
 Let it be, dear Lord, let it be. 
 When my feeble life is o'er 
 And time for me will be no more 
 Guide me gently, safely o'er 
 To Thy kingdom dear Lord, to Thy shore. 
 Just a closer walk with Thee 
 Grant it Jesus, is my plea 
 Daily walkin' close to Thee 
 Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

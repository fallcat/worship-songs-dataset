Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore 
 There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world 
 Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide 
 Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life 
 The lord said, "Simon, haul your nets in 
 From now on you're a fisher of men" 
 Well, I like fishin', 
 That's why it caught my ear 
 The Lord knew how to get to me 
 And what I'd need to hear 
 Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore 
 There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world 
 Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide 
 Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life 
 When the sea is troubled and it's hard to stay afloat 
 And you feel like Jesus is sleeping in the boat 
 Don't you dare give up on the Prince of Peace 
 And in the middle of the storm 
 You will find a sweet release 
 Keep your lure in the water, don't just sit by the shore 
 There are souls to be caught everywhere in this old world 
 Go where hearts are plenty, don't just drift with the tide 
 Keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life 
 Yeah keep your lure in the water, in the waters of life

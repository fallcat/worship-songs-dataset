Trailers for sale or rent 
 Rooms to let... fifty cents. 
 No phone, no pool, no pets 
 I ain't got no cigarettes 
 Ah, but... two hours of pushin' broom 
 Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room 
 I'm a man of means by no means 
 King of the road. 
 Third boxcar, midnight train 
 Destination... Bangor, Maine. 
 Old worn out clothes and shoes, 
 I don't pay no union dues, 
 I smoke old stogies I have found 
 Short, but not too big around 
 I'm a man of means by no means 
 King of the road. 
 I know every engineer on every train 
 All of their children, and all of their names 
 And every handout in every town 
 And every lock that ain't locked 
 When no one's around. 
 I sing,

It was not a silent night, there was blood on the ground 
 You could hear a woman cry in the alleyway that night on the streets of David's town 
 And the stable was not clean and the cobblestones were cold 
 And little Mary full of grace with tears upon her face had no mother's hand to hold 
 It was a labor of pain, it was a cold sky above 
 But for the girl on the ground in the dark with every beat of her beautiful heart 
 It was a labor of love 
 Noble Joseph by her side, callused hands and weary eyes 
 No midwives to be found on the streets of David's town in the middle of the night 
 So he held her and he prayed, shafts of moonlight on his face 
 But the baby in her womb, he was the maker of the moon 
 He was the Author of the Faith that could make the mountains move 
 It was a labor of pain, it was a cold sky above 
 But for the girl on the ground in the dark with every beat of her beautiful heart 
 It was a labor of love 
 For little Mary full of grace, with tears on her face 
 It was a labor of love 
 It was not a silent night, on the streets of David's town

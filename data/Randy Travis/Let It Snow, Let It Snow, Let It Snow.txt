Oh the weather outside is frightful√ä 
 But the fire is so delightful 
 And since we've no place to go 
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
 It doesn't show signs of stopping 
 So I've bought some corn for popping 
 The lights are turned way down low 
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
 When we finally kiss goodnight 
 How I'll hate going out in the storm! 
 But if you'll only hold me tight 
 All the way home I'll be warm 
 Oh, the fire is slowly dying 
 And, my dear, we're still good-bying 
 As long as you love me so 
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

You say love is just a lie 
 And it always ends 
 With sad goodbyes 
 It makes you hurt 
 It makes you cry 
 But I say wait 
 Let me try 
 Let me lay my hands 
 Upon your heart and see if they can heal 
 Those secret scars of loneliness 
 That you can not conceal 
 I will wipe away the saddest tear 
 That falls from your blue eyes 
 My love can heal the hurt you feel 
 Let me try 
 You say you know 
 How it will end 
 That you'll wake up 
 Alone again 
 But love that's true 
 Won't say goodbye 
 And if you'll only 
 Let me try 
 Let me lay my hands 
 Upon your heart and pray if they can heal 
 Those secret scars of loneliness 
 That you can not conceal 
 I will wipe away the saddest tear 
 That falls from your blue eyes 
 My love can heal the hurt you feel 
 Let me try 
 Oh love can heal 
 The hurt you feel 
 Let me try

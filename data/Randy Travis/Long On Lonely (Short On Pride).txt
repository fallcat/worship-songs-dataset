I'll bet that you're surpised to see me 
 Wonder what I'm doing at your door 
 But you can't be more surprised than I am 
 I thought I didn't need you anymore 
 Thought there was something waiting out there 
 Something I wanted but now it's so clear 
 Baby it's a cold, cold world 
 Out here tonight 
 It's nothing at all like I thought I'd find 
 So if you wonder why I'm standing here 
 I'm a little long on lonely, a little short on pride 
 If you slam the door, I wouldn't blame you 
 You've got every reason to turn me down 
 I was so sure I had the answers 
 After what I've been through, I'm not sure now 
 I won't say I love you, don't know if it's true 
 I will say I need you, God knows I do 
 Baby it's a cold, cold world 
 Out here tonight 
 It's nothing at all like I thought I'd find 
 So if you wonder why I'm standing here 
 I'm a little long on lonely, a little short on pride 
 I'm a little long on lonely, a little short on pride

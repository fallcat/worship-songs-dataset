I remember how it used to feel 
 Ridin' down ol' two mile hill 
 Tennis shoes up on the, handlebars 
 Payin' no mind to the passin' cars 
 No doubts, no fears 
 Just like, when you are here 
 No chains, no strings 
 No fences, no walls 
 No net, just you 
 To catch me, when I fall 
 Look heart, no hands 
 Took a little time to get up to speed 
 To find the confidence and strength I'd need 
 To just let go and reach for the sky 
 You know sometimes it felt I could fly 
 No doubts, no fears 
 Just like, when you are here 
 No chains, no strings 
 No fences, no walls 
 No net, just you 
 To catch me, when I fall 
 Look heart, no hands 
 It doesn't take much 
 Just a smile or a touch 
 And I'm a kid again 
 I can almost feel that wind 
 No chains, no strings 
 No fences, no walls 
 No net, just you 
 To catch me, when I fall 
 Look heart, no hands 
 Look heart, no hands

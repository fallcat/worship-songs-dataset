Back when I was still in school 
 I got taught as a rule 
 That my heart could always fool my head 
 So I tripped and fell a lot 
 Learning what true love was not 
 Till one evening Mama said we ought to talk 
 She said love is a gamble 
 It's a chance that you take 
 You lay your heart down 
 And you bet it won't break 
 You bet your sweet dreams 
 Won't get tattered and torn 
 But when that happens 
 You must shake off those blues 
 Just remember you've got nothing to lose 
 But you've had true love since the day you were born 
 Since the day you were born 
 Then she told me all she knew 
 About what makes true love true 
 And it hasn't much to do with heat 
 Young hearts race and then grow still 
 Passion cools and always will 
 But a river just keeps filling up the sea 
 You see love is a gamble 
 It's a chance that you take 
 You lay your heart down 
 And you bet it won't break 
 You bet your sweet dreams 
 Won't get tattered and torn 
 But when that happens 
 You must dream up some more 
 When you find it you'll have seen it before 
 But you've had true love 
 Since the day you were born 
 Love is a gamble 
 It's a chance that you take 
 To lay your heart down 
 And you bet it won't break 
 You bet your sweet dreams 
 Won't get tattered and torn 
 But when that happens 
 You must shake off those blues 
 And just remember you got nothing to lose 
 You've had true love 
 Since the day you were born 
 Since the day you were born

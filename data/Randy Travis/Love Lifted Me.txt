I was sinkin' deep in sin 
 Far from the peaceful shore 
 Very deeply stained within 
 Sinking to rise no more. 
 But the master of the sea 
 Heard my despairing cry 
 And from the waters lifted me 
 Now safe am I. 
 Love lifted me 
 Love lifted me 
 When nothing else could help 
 Love lifted me. 
 Love lifted me 
 Love lifted me 
 When nothing else could help 
 Love lifted me. 
 All my heart to him I give 
 Ever to him I'll cling 
 In his blessed presence live 
 Ever his praises sing. 
 Love so mighty and so true 
 Merits my soul's best song 
 Faithful, loving service too 
 To him belongs 
 Love lifted me 
 Love lifted me 
 When nothing else could help 
 Love lifted me. 
 Love lifted me 
 Love lifted me 
 When nothing else could help 
 Love lifted me. 
 Love lifted me

It was sure good to see you yesterday 
 You seem so much better than when we were together 
 Don't even tell me his name 
 Heard you found what you're looking for 
 Now you're not crying anymore 
 But that smile he put on your face it breaks my heart in two 
 I hate to admit it but love looks good on you 
 I still remember that day 
 We started packing up boxes, you said let's cut our losses 
 And get out of each others way 
 It'll be good in the long run and I knew I'd find someone 
 But that smile he put on your face it breaks my heart in two 
 I hate to admit it but love looks good on you 
 It wasn't your fault it wasn't mine 
 It's just the way things work out sometime 
 It wasn't easy walking away knowing he's taken my place 
 But it was sure good to see you yesterday 
 You seem so much better than when we were together 
 Please don't tell me his name 
 Yeah he's all I've been looking for and I'm not lonely anymore 
 But that smile he put on your face it breaks my heart in two 
 I hate to admit it but love looks good on you 
 I still remember that day 
 I hate to admit it but love looks good on you

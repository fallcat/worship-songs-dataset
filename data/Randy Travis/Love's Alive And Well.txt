I saw a young white boy open up the door 
 For an old black lady who was walkin' in the store 
 And it hit me, yeah, it hit me, things ain't all that bad 
 I saw a homeless man pull a dollar form his shoe 
 Slip it in the plate as it was passin' down the pew and I wondered 
 I couldn't help but wonder was it the last he had 
 Oh, I believe that love's alive and well 
 Though the way things are these days 
 Some say it's hard to tell 
 And I've seen one little candle 
 Keep away the darkness all by itself 
 And that's the reason why I know love's alive and well 
 They'd been together sixty three years 
 Still they smile at each other and their eyes fill up with tears 
 Ain't that something, but ain't that how it's supposed to be 
 Oh, I believe that love's alive and well 
 Though the way things are these days 
 Some say it's hard to tell 
 And I've seen one little candle 
 Keep away the darkness all by itself 
 And that's the reason why I know love's alive and well 
 Yeah, that's the reason why I know love's alive and well

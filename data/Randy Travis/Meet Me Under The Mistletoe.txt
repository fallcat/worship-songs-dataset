Meet me under the the mistletoe 
 Midnight Christmas Eve 
 Your sweet kiss is the first gift 
 I'd like to receive 
 The presents that we bought 
 Will have to wait beneath the tree 
 Meet me under the the mistletoe 
 Midnight Christmas Eve 
 There's frost on all the windows 
 Candles burnin' bright 
 Stockings on the mantel 
 Everything's just right 
 Soon the house will come alive 
 With family and friends 
 I'd love some time alone with you 
 Before it all begins 
 Meet me under the the mistletoe 
 Midnight Christmas Eve 
 Your sweet kiss is the first gift 
 I'd like to receive 
 The presents that we bought 
 Will have to wait beneath the tree 
 Meet me under the the mistletoe 
 Midnight Christmas Eve 
 It seems I've hardly seen you 
 We've had so much to do 
 With the holiday approaching 
 I've sure been missin' you 
 I can't want till Christmas morn 
 To hold you in my arms 
 I'm feelin' like a kid again 
 Waitin' on Santa Claus 
 Meet me under the the mistletoe 
 Midnight Christmas Eve 
 Your sweet kiss is the first gift 
 I'd like to receive 
 The presents that we bought 
 Will have to wait beneath the tree 
 Meet me under the the mistletoe 
 Midnight Christmas Eve 
 Meet me under the the mistletoe 
 Midnight Christmas Eve

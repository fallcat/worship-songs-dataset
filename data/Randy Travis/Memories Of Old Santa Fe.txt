As blue shadows fall 
 Across the canyon wall 
 The cattle are quiet and still 
 Dusty, sore and tired 
 I build myself a fire 
 As a full moon 
 Peaks over the hills. 
 A blanket for my bed 
 A saddle for my head 
 I'll sleep 
 But in my dreams I'll stray 
 Back across the miles 
 To where my darlin' smiles 
 In memories of old Santa Fe. 
 Adios mi corinyo 
 She told me that day 
 As I kissed her softly 
 And then rode away. 
 Now I lie beneath the stars 
 Without her in my arms 
 So lonesome 
 And so far away 
 But each night 
 I go back there 
 In my dreams 
 And in my prayers 
 And in memories of old Santa Fe. 
 Adios mi corinyo 
 She told me that day 
 As I kissed her softly 
 And then rode away. 
 She's waitin' 
 There I know 
 But for now 
 All I can hold 
 Are my memories 
 Of old Sata Fe

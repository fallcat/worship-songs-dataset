I said one thing I'd never do was care 
 Or hang around for too long anywhere 
 I could always move ahead 
 With nothing left behind 
 Then you started messin' with my mind 
 This town was just another place to play 
 Have some fun and then be on my way 
 You were just another way for me 
 To pass some time 
 Then you started messin' with my mind 
 I can't believe how much my mind has changed 
 Or the way my life's been rearanged 
 I swore one thing I'd never do 
 Was be the stayin' kind 
 Then you started messin' with my mind 
 The first in line for party time, was me 
 Always the last to leave or try to be 
 I never thought I'd wanna change 
 I suited me just fine 
 Then you started messin' with my mind 
 I can't believe how much my mind has changed 
 Or the way my life's been rearanged 
 I swore one thing I'd never do 
 Was be the stayin' kind 
 Then you started messin' with my mind 
 I swore one thing I'd never do 
 Was be the stayin' kind 
 Then you started messin' with my mind...

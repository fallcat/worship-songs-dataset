If the wife and I are fussin' brother that's our right 
 'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight 
 Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business 
 'Cause if you mind your business then you won't be mindin' mine 
 Oh the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing 
 She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring 
 Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business 
 Well if you mind your business then you won't be mindin' mine 
 I got a little gal that wears her hair up high 
 The boys all whistle when she walks by 
 Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business 
 Well if you mind your own business you sure won't be minding mine 
 If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three 
 Now, brother that's my headache don't you worry 'bout me 
 Just mind your own business mind your own business 
 If you mind your business then you won't be mindin' mine 
 Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned 
 I got all that I can do just to mind my own 
 Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business 
 If you mind your own business you'll stay busy all the time

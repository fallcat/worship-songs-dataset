I've searched the world over all of my life 
 Just looking for something 
 To make my love shine 
 Like a candle that burns in the night 
 But I came up with nothin' 
 'Til I looked in your eyes 
 Deeper and deeper inside. 
 And all of the treasures 
 I found in your soul 
 Was like finding a diamond 
 When you're mining for coal. 
 I've been a fool for glitter and gold 
 And women that sparkle shiny and cold 
 Like a statue carved out of ice 
 They shimmer like tinsel 
 On a blue Christmas night 
 But they never were quite so bright. 
 As all of the treasures 
 That loving you holds 
 It's like finding a diamond 
 When you're mining for coal. 
 I was a miner 
 And you were a rock in the dust 
 But you became flawless 
 When you were you polished by love. 
 And when I found you 
 I lost all control 
 I found me a diamond 
 Just mining for coal. 
 And when I found you 
 I lost all control 
 I found me a diamond 
 Just mining for coal...

He stares into the mirror 
 At the shell of a man he once was 
 At the hard evidence 
 Of what living for a dollar one day does 
 He thinks about the things he's gonna change 
 As soon as he gets back up to speed 
 Then the nurse comes in with something for the pain 
 And says "Is there anything more you need?" 
 He says "Yeah" 
 More life 
 More time 
 More faith 
 And the presence of mind to breath deeper 
 Love stronger 
 Stay the moment, one moment longer 
 Less anger 
 Less worries 
 Born alive 
 He says 
 I've been a mover and a shaker, buddy 
 Second to none 
 With the will of steel 
 Like a closing deal 
 You bet your life I got it done 
 Lately I think about the ones I might have hurt 
 And how easily I've easen in their way 
 What did I think it all was worth 
 Cause there's nothing I would not trade 
 For 
 More life 
 More time 
 More faith 
 And a presence of mind to deep breathe deeper 
 Love stronger 
 Stay in the moment, one moment longer 
 Less anger 
 Less worry 
 There is a woman who has loved me faithfully 
 And children I can't believe are grown 
 God knows why only now I see 
 They are the one true happiness I know 
 Breathe deeper 
 Love stronger 
 Stay in the moment, one moment longer 
 More love 
 More light 
 More light

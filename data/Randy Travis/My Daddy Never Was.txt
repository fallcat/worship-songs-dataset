My boss will tell you that I've been to work all week on time 
 That I ain't had no liquor on my breathe 
 Ain't no kinda' secret, I've been known to take a drink 
 And it's made me do some things that I regret 
 Loretta said this ain't no kind of way to raise a family 
 And one night she called it quits and called a cab 
 She left her clothes out on the clothes line 
 And the dishes in the sink 
 So I guess she knows that she ain't coming back 
 Well, I just want to see my kids 
 I just want to hold my girls 
 Heaven knows I ain't got much of nothing else in this ol' world 
 I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved 
 I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was 
 Now lately she's been knowin' this old boy she met in church 
 And I can't say she's wrong for wanting more 
 I gave him the right to tell my wife that I can't come around 
 The night I knocked a hole in her front door 
 And Loretta tooks my keys and she made me wait outside 
 But she didn't call the law she called a cab 
 And as I pulled away I saw something in her eyes 
 So I reckon that she knows I ain't so bad 
 I just want to see my kids 
 I just want to hold my girls 
 Heaven knows I ain't got much of nothing else in this ol' world 
 I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved 
 I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was 
 Well, my boss will tell you that I've been to work all week on time 
 And I ain't had no liquor on my breathe

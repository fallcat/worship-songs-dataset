You're spreadin' lies, all over town 
 About the way you brushed me off and put me down 
 Well, I'm here to say, make no mistake 
 My heart cracked, but it did not break. 
 I can't deny, the hurt was deep 
 The way you slammed that door 
 And walked right out on me 
 But I'm telling you, get one thing straight 
 My heart cracked, but it did not break. 
 Shatterd dreams, lay everywhere 
 Broken promises, are all we share 
 I finally took, all I could take 
 My heart cacked, but it did not break. 
 Well I was blue, but not for long 
 'Cause this brand new love 
 I got has made me strong 
 And I'm over you, and all the ache 
 My heart cracked, but it did not break. 
 Shattered dreams, lay everywhere 
 Broken promises, are all we share 
 I finally took, all I could take 
 My heart cracked, but it did not break. 
 My heart cracked, but it did not break...

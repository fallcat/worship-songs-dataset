My house is no mansion 
 But it still holds my treasures 
 Things that will never be sold 
 There's few things in this world 
 That just can't be measured 
 By money, by silver and gold 
 And my house is filled with the things that I love 
 From her smile in the mornin' 
 To her soft goodnight hugs 
 Her whispers, her laughter 
 Everything that she does 
 And my house is filled with the things that I love 
 This old bed that we sleep on 
 Don't have satin covers 
 But it holds some great memories 
 No decorations can make better lovers 
 In her arms I feel like a king 
 And my house is filled with the things that I love 
 From her smile in the mornin' 
 To her soft goodnight hugs 
 Her whispers, her laughter 
 Everything that she does 
 And my house is filled with the things that I love 
 Yes, my house is filled with the things that I love

I take a trip every evening scrolling down memory lane 
 I'm walkin' again those familiar paths dreaming those dreams again 
 And I can always see my sweetheart just as she used to be 
 Waiting for someone at the garden gate and I know that someone is me 
 Big brown eyes and pearly hair and you'd tell that's Mary 
 Rosy cheeks and ruby lips can't you tell that's Mary 
 Ofttimes in the evenings we'd go scrolling 
 Hand in hand together beneath the pepper tree 
 And I can feel her hand in mine as I sit alone tonight 
 Dreaming of the times I spent with Mary 
 Ofttimes in the evenings... 
 Oh gee wouldn't it be wonderful to open up the doors of the past 
 And live again as yesterday 
 But you know no matter where I wander no matter where I roam 
 There'll always be a place in my heart boys 
 Fofr a girl away back for a girl that I used to call Mary

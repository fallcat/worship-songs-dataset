I've been a fool for love 
 Ever since I was a baby 
 Just a rockin' in a cradle 
 As a rule I was the kind 
 That laid his feelings 
 Up front and on the table. 
 I gave up my world so many times 
 Just to see 'em tear it apart 
 Oh, Lord have a little bit of pity 
 On my poor old heart. 
 I wonder just how many times 
 A broken heart can mend 
 Just when I get back on my feet 
 Lord, I always fall again. 
 Bruises, burns, lies, goodbyes 
 They've all left some scars 
 Oh, Lord have a little bit of pity 
 On my poor old heart. 
 I oughta know by now 
 After all this debt 
 And heartache lessons 
 I could go without 
 Going through hell 
 Just to find a little heaven. 
 Seems to me every woman I meet 
 Has leavin' down to an art 
 Oh, Lord have a little bit of pity 
 On my poor old heart. 
 I wonder just how many times 
 A broken heart can mend 
 Just when I get back on my feet 
 Lord, I always fall again. 
 Bruises, burns, lies, goodbyes 
 They've all left some scars 
 Oh, Lord have a little bit of pity 
 On my poor old heart. 
 Bruises, burns, lies, goodbyes 
 They've all left some scars 
 Oh, Lord have a little bit of pity 
 On my poor old heart. 
 Hey, Lord have a little bit of pity 
 On my poor old heart...

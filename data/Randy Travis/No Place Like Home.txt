Well there's my easy chair 
 Just sittin' there 
 I've spent a lot of time 
 Thinkin' of this perfect love 
 I know is yours and mine 
 And oh how I love 
 That old picture on the wall 
 Of you and me and the kids 
 My most favorite times in life 
 I've spent right here where we live 
 There's no place like home 
 There's no place like home 
 It just hit me 
 As I was leaving 
 There's no place like home 
 From the bedroom 
 I smell perfume 
 My favorite kind your wore 
 And it brings back memories 
 Of all those nights 
 Behind our bedroom door 
 And the saddest thing 
 I think I've ever seen 
 Was my closet all cleaned out 
 It's sad to think 
 That one must leave 
 'Cause we can't work things out 
 There's no place like home 
 There's no place like home 
 It just hit me 
 As I was leaving 
 There's no place like home 
 So baby say that I can stay 
 For just a day or so 
 Then maybe I can change your mind 
 And I won't have to go 
 Just look into 
 These baby blues 
 And tell me it's okay 
 I love that smile 
 It drives me wild 
 No love won't die today 
 There's no place like home 
 There's no place like home

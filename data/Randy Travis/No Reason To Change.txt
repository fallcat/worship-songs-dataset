I know a man, we call him Poor Boy Jones 
 He's never been a hundred miles from home 
 He's got a pretty good farm 
 And a level head 
 A heart of gold 
 No satellite dish for his TV set 
 And he ain't online with the internet 
 He says guitar music entertains us here 
 And it sounds real good to the untrained ear 
 And I can't find a reason to change 
 More of this and more of that 
 Has never been my game 
 The way I've got it figured out 
 I ain't missed a thing 
 And I can't find a reason to change 
 Some people like to fly around first class 
 But a greyhound bus goes pretty dang fast 
 Been a while, lot of times when time were lean 
 A big night out was a Dairy Queen 
 He says, "All my children believe in God 
 They can hold their own 
 They can hold a job 
 There's a whole lot of color in the human race 
 And loving one another makes a better place" 
 And I can't find a reason to change 
 More of this and more of that 
 Has never been my game 
 The way I've got it figured out 
 I ain't missed a thing 
 And I can't find a reason to change 
 No, I can't find a reason to change

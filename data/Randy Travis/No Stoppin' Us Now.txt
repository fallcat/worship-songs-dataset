There's no stoppin' us now 
 We've gone all the way 
 There's no slowin' down 
 This love fits us so right 
 There's no holdin' back 
 And there's no end in sight. 
 You and I have found 
 What few will ever find 
 And we started so young 
 Even time's on our side. 
 There's no stoppin' us now 
 We've gone all the way 
 There's no slowin' down 
 This love fits us so right 
 There's no holdin' back 
 And there's no end in sight. 
 It's hard to believe 
 That I really got by without you 
 So now every hour seems empty 
 When I'm not beside you. 
 There's no stoppin' us now 
 We've gone all the way 
 There's no slowin' down 
 This love fits us so right 
 There's no holdin' back 
 And there's no end in sight. 
 There's no holdin' back 
 And there's no end in sight...

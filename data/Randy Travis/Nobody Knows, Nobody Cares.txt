Nobody knows how lonely my road 
 Nobody knows how heavy my load 
 Nobody cares how tearful my way 
 How dark the night, how weary the day 
 Nobody knows, nobody cares 
 My every burden nobody shares 
 My only comfort and my only strength 
 Is Jesus walking by my side all the way 
 Nobody knows how hard I must toil 
 Causing sometimes my heart to recoil 
 Nobody cares when I try to sleep 
 I lay awake and I bitterly weep 
 Nobody knows, nobody cares 
 My every burden, nobody shares 
 My only comfort, my only strength 
 Is Jesus walking by my side all the way 
 Nobody knows how weary my cross 
 Nobody knows my trouble, my loss 
 Nobody cares if even I'm ill 
 Or if life's hardships have broken my will 
 Nobody knows, nobody cares 
 My every burden nobody shares 
 My only comfort and my only strength 
 Is Jesus walking by my side all the way 
 Nobody knows, nobody cares 
 My every burden nobody shares 
 My only comfort, my only strength 
 Is Jesus walking by my side all the way

Oh the wind can blow and the snow can fall 
 The pipes can freeze but through it all 
 I'm gonna be just fine 
 Nothin's gonna bring me down at Christmas time 
 With all the gifts I bought I'm as good as broke 
 I know I should care 'cause it's no joke 
 But I don't seem to mind 
 Nothin's gonna bring me down at Christmas time 
 As long as I can snuggle with my honey in a huddle 
 When the Christmas sun goes down 
 Santa could skip my street 
 And I won't miss a beat 
 Oh my battery's dead and my car won't start 
 But there's a nice warm fire burnin' in my heart 
 Oh I'm gonna be just fine 
 'Cause nothin's gonna bring me down at Christmas time 
 I don't seem to worry or get much in a hurry 
 When Santa's on his way 
 No matter how much I get 
 It's more than I expect 
 Oh the wind can blow and the ice can fall 
 The pipes can freeze but through it all 
 I'm gonna be just fine 
 'Cause nothin's gonna bring me down at Christmas time 
 'Cause nothin's gonna bring me down at Christmas time

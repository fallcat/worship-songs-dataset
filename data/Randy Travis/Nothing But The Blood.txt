What can wash away my sins? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can make me whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Oh precious is that flow that makes me white as snow 
 No other fount I know 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can wash away my sins? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus

 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Oh precious is that flow that makes me white as snow 
 No other fount I know 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Oh precious is that flow that makes me white as snow 
 No other fount I know 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus

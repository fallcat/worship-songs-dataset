O little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting Light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in thee tonight 
 For Christ is born of Mary 
 And gathered all above 
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep 
 Their watch of wondering love 
 O morning stars together 
 Proclaim the holy birth 
 And praises sing to God the King 
 And Peace to men on earth 
 O little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting Light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in thee tonight 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in thee tonight

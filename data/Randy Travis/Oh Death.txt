A long time ago, Lazarus died 
 All hope seemed gone as his sisters cried 
 And Jesus walked to where he lay 
 He called his name and he came out of the grave 
 Oh death, where is thy sting? 
 Oh grave, where is thy victory? 
 You thought you had a hold on me 
 But you were wrong, I've been set free 
 Jesus hung on a rugged cross 
 He gave His life for a world that was lost 
 He lay three days in a borrowed grave 
 But when He came out I could hear Him say 
 Oh death, where is thy sting? 
 Oh grave, where is thy victory? 
 You thought you had a hold on me 
 But you were wrong, I've been set free 
 One day I'll lay this body down 
 They'll dress me up and put me in the ground 
 But when Jesus comes in the sky 
 Just listen close and you'll hear me cry 
 Oh death, where is thy sting? 
 Oh grave, where is thy victory? 
 You thought you had a hold on me 
 But you were wrong, I've been set free 
 Oh death, where is thy sting? 
 Oh grave, where is thy victory? 
 You thought you had a hold on me 
 But you were wrong, I've been set free

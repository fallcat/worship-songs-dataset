There is a name I love to hear 
 I love to sing its worth 
 It sounds like music in my ear 
 The sweetest name on Earth 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Because He first loved me 
 It tells me of a Savior's love 
 Who died to set me free 
 It tells me of His precious blood 
 The sinner's perfect plea 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Because He first loved me 
 It tells of one whose loving heart 
 Can feel my deepest woe 
 Who in each sorrow bears a part 
 That none can below 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Because He first loved me 
 Oh how I love Jesus 
 Because He first loved me

The night before Christmas alone in the dark 
 Not a creature is stirring except for my heart 
 This old house without you just don't feel right 
 Oh, what a silent night 
 Then in the twinklin' of my eye 
 A teardrop comes fallin' as I realize 
 I'm all alone and you're by his side 
 Oh, what a silent night 
 Your stockin' are hangin' across our old bed 
 As visions of yesterdays dance in my head 
 The fire burns hotter but I'm cold as ice 
 Oh, what a silent night 
 Then in the twinklin' of my eye 
 A teardrop comes fallin' as I realize 
 I'm all alone and you're by his side 
 Oh, what a silent night 
 Oh, what a silent night

Oh, what a time to be me 
 I'm sorry you're feeling so lonely 
 I know how hard it can be 
 You lost your one and your only 
 You told her you had to be free 
 You say that you think she's found somebody new 
 Who gives her the love that she needs 
 Now it's safe to say it's a bad day for you 
 But oh what a time to be me 
 You say that you just had to call her 
 To tell her you knew you were wrong 
 You're thinking you mis-dialed her number 
 Just because I answered the phone 
 I hate to be the one to have to break it to you 
 But you got it accurately 
 Now it's safe to say it's a bad day for you 
 But oh what a time to be me 
 Remember those kisses you used to receive 
 They sure feel good on my cheek 
 And now that you mentioned it, I can't believe 
 That anyone could ever leave a love so sweet 
 Now I truly hope that we can still be friends 
 It's hard to find a buddy like you 
 And you're more than welcome 
 But right now I get something to do 
 And oh by the way here's a message for you 
 Would you mind returning her key 
 There's somebody else that she's giving it to 
 And oh, what a time to be me 
 Remember those kisses you used to receive 
 They sure feel good on my cheek 
 And now that you mentioned it, I can't believe 
 That anyone could ever leave a love so sweet 
 Now I truly hope that we can still be friends 
 It's hard to find a buddy like you 
 And you're more than welcome 
 But right now I get something to do 
 And oh by the way here's a message for you 
 Would you mind returning her key 
 There's somebody else that she's giving it to 
 And oh, what a time to be me 
 Now it's safe to say it's a bad day for you 
 But oh, what a time to be me

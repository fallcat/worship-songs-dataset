Well, I know it ain't much 
 But it's all that I have since she's gone 
 One black and white mem'ry 
 Of the only love I've ever known 
 One moment in time 
 When we were together 
 A page from the past 
 To haunt me forever 
 A constant reminder 
 That hearts heal much slower than bones 
 Now my whole world's in one 8x10 
 With four metal walls holding it in 
 Through one plate glass window 'neath a blanket of dust 
 Stands an 8x10 picture of us 
 I wish I'd have told her what I felt inside 
 Back when her sweet love was flowing like wine 
 I wish she would come back and love me again 
 The way that she loved me in that old 8x10 
 Now the silence is deaf'ning 
 As the day turns to dark 
 Her presence gets stronger with each beat of my heart 
 I pretend that she's here 
 And we've made a new start 
 And for a moment she's back in my arms 
 Now my whole world's in one 8x10 
 With four metal walls holding it in 
 Through one plate glass window 'neath a blanket of dust 
 Stands an 8x10 picture of us 
 There's an 8x10 picture of us

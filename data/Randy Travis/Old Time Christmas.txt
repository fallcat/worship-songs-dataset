The old log is burnin' yellow and red 
 Small eyes are fightin' 
 That old sleepy head stockin's are filled 
 While stories of goodwill are told at the edge of the bed 
 It's an old time Christmas 
 Family and friends 'round the tree 
 It's an old time Christmas 
 Like the ones in my memory 
 Now the gifts are all open, the kids in the yard 
 Grand-dad nods off in a chair 
 And the smells from the kitchen are too fine to mention 
 And there's peace on Earth everywhere 
 It's an old time Christmas 
 Family and friends 'round the tree 
 It's an old time Christmas 
 Like the ones in my memory 
 Church bells ringin' 
 Choirs singin' everywhere 
 There's love in the air 
 It's an old time Christmas 
 Family and friends 'round the tree 
 It's an old time Christmas 
 Like the ones in my memory 
 It's an old time Christmas 
 Like the ones in my memory

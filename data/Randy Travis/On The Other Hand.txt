On one hand I count the reasons, I could stay with you 
 And hold you close to me, all night long 
 So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you 
 On that hand there's no reason, why it's wrong 
 But on the other hand, there's a golden band 
 To remind of someone, who would not understand 
 On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man 
 But the reason I must go, is on the other hand 
 In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died 
 When I looked into your eyes, I found myself 
 And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive 
 I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else 
 But on the other hand, there's a golden band 
 To remind of someone, who would not understand 
 On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man 
 But the reason I must go, is on the other hand 
 Yeah the reason I must go, is on the other hand

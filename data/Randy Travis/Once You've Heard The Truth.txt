It was just like every other morning 
 The sun was shining 
 It was storming 
 They had words over breakfast 
 And he said something reckless 
 Just a solitary slip of the tonge 
 Another woman's name and it was done 
 Once you've heard the truth 
 Stared it in the face 
 Once you've got the proof 
 There ain't no hiding place 
 It's like thunder crashing down 
 Or a freight train running through you 
 No, you won't forget the sound 
 Once you've heard the truth 
 She threw her wedding ring 
 And it rolled across the floor 
 She didn't say a thing 
 But he heard that slamming door 
 Once you've heard the truth 
 Stared it in the face 
 Once you've got the proof 
 There ain't no hiding place 
 It's like thunder crashing down 
 Or a freight train running through you 
 Oh, you won't forget the sound 
 Once you've heard the truth 
 No, you won't forget the sound 
 Once you've heard the truth 
 It was just like every other morning 
 The sun was shining 
 It was storming

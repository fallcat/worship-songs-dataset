When I'm feelin' lonely 
 And I'm far away from home 
 I just sing out your name 
 Like a one word song. 
 In a moment of weakness 
 When I need to be strong 
 I just sing out your name 
 Like a one word song. 
 And the thought of you 
 Brings a soulful melody 
 And passion and trust 
 And a healing harmony. 
 And when I lose my way 
 I get back where I belong 
 When I sing out your name 
 Like a one word song. 
 And the thought of you 
 Brings a soulful melody 
 And passion and trust 
 And a healing harmony. 
 And when I lose my way 
 I get back where I belong 
 When I sing out your name 
 Like a one word song. 
 Yeah, I sing out your name 
 Like a one word song...

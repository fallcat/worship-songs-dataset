Everybody knows you've been stepping on my toes 
 And I'm getting pretty tired of it 
 You keep a stepping out of line 
 You're messing with my mind if you had any sense you'd quit 
 'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl 
 You said I was the only man in this whole world 
 Now you better do some thinking then you'll find 
 You got the only daddy that'll walk the line 
 I keep-a working every day all you want to is play 
 I'm tired of staying out all night 
 I'm coming unglued from your funny little moods 
 Now Honey baby that ain't right 
 'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl 
 You said I was the only man in this whole world 
 Now you better do some thinking then you'll find 
 You got the only daddy that'll walk the line 
 You keep-a packing up my clothes; nearly everybody knows 
 That you're still just a-putting me on 
 But when I start a walking, gonna hear you start a squawking 
 And begging me to come back home 
 'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl 
 You said I was the only man in this whole world 
 Now you better do some thinking then you'll find 
 You got the only daddy that'll walk the line 
 You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

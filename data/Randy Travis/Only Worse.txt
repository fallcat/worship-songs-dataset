I just dropped in, 'cause I could use a friend 
 And a little bit of consolation 
 I'm hangin' by a thread from the southern end of my rope 
 If you really wanna know 
 I'll do my best to explain my situation 
 Maybe I can find the words 
 If the tears don't get me first. 
 It's kinda like fallin' from the sky 
 When you're up a mile high 
 And your parachute won't open 
 Kinda like clingin' to the bottom of the bottom 
 When the bottom drops out 
 The only way I know to say how bad her leavin' hurts 
 It's kinda like a heartache, only worse 
 Only worse. 
 It wasn't my first brush with love 
 But this one was the deepest 
 Yeah, I've been blue, but this time it's closer to black 
 Swore, I'd never get hurt again 
 But here I am in pieces 
 When this one broke my heart that was just the start. 
 It's kinda like fallin' from the sky 
 When you're up a mile high 
 And your parachute won't open 
 Kinda like clingin' to the bottom of the bottom 
 When the bottom drops out 
 The only way I know to say how bad her leavin' hurts 
 It's kinda like a heartache, only worse 
 Only worse. 
 It's kinda like being cut open 
 Kinda like being burned at the stake 
 Kinda like drownin' in the ocean 
 Knowin' there's no help on the way. 
 It's kinda like fallin' from the sky 
 When you're up a mile high 
 And your parachute won't open 
 Kinda like clingin' to the bottom of the bottom 
 When the bottom drops out 
 The only way I know to say how bad her leavin' hurts 
 It's kinda like a heartache, only worse 
 Only worse...

Oscar was an angel and he used to walk the streets 
 Shoutin' out some prophesies at everyone he'd meet 
 He was a local fixture; like a cop out on a beat 
 Folks said he'd been shell-shocked long ago 
 And more than that for no one seemed to know 
 Oscar was a walker; at least four miles twice a day 
 The entire length of Main Street he'd be shoutin' all the way 
 And I had no idea where he heard the things he'd say 
 But he was not your normal voice of doom; 
 It was a happy song sung slightly out of tune 
 And he'd say, "Everyone will die and go to heaven and we will all be angels 
 Someday and what you are in this world don't count for nothin' 'cause we are 
 Only children, we're just lost along the way, but we will all be angels someday" 
 Well, I worked at the Rialto; I sold tickets at the door 
 And Oscar, he'd come by most everyday by half past four 
 And he'd pay to see some movie that he'd seen ten times before 
 But mostly we'd just let him in for free 
 Then he'd watch five minutes, then he'd come and talk to me 
 And he'd say, "Everyone will die and go to heaven and we will all be angels 
 Someday and what you are in this world don't count for nothin'. For we are only 
 Children, we're just lost along the way, but we will all be angels someday" 
 Well, it's going on ten years now 
 Since I left my hometown 
 And I went back last summer 
 For a week I hung around 
 I looked out for Oscar, he was no where to be found 
 And someone said they finally had to commit him 
 And he died before they had time to forget him 
 Now, I'm not about to argue, Oscar's train had jumped the track 
 But I'll bet my last dollar on the plain and simple fact 
 Oscar never said a word about me behind my back 
 And the way that I was raised to understand 
 Well, that bone, it makes him the better man 
 And he'd say, "Everyone will die and go to heaven and we will all be angels 
 Someday and what you are in this world don't count for nothin'. For we are only 
 Children, we're just lost along the way, but we will all be angels someday" 
 Yeah, we will all be angels someday

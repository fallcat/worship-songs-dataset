About a thousand years before it came to pass it was said that it would be 
 A virgin would be found to be with child and give birth to our King 
 And they laid Him in a manger in the town of Bethlehem 
 Born there in a stable 'cause there was no room in the Inn 
 And when He grew to be a man He began to teach 
 He came just for you and me to set the captives free 
 And He gladly gave His life for us, without one word He died 
 So we could live forever in Heaven by His side 
 And He gladly gave his life for us, without one word He died 
 So we could live forever in Heaven by His side 
 And all He asks of you and me is simply to believe 
 That baby boy in Bethlehem truly was our King

I'm in need of a remedy 
 To cure me from loving you 
 It may sound a little extreme 
 I'll do what I have to do 
 Bury your jacket in my backyard 
 Carry your picture in my shoe 
 And keep walkin' 'til the hurting stops 
 Keep walkin' 'til my temperature drops 
 Keep walkin' 'til the fever is gone 
 And you're out of my bones 
 I'm in need of medicine 
 Somethin' strong that'll work real fast 
 That I can take to fortify me 
 To keep my arm from takin' you back 
 Chase that ghost out from under my bed 
 Still these voices in my head 
 They keep talkin', weaving their spell 
 But I'm talkin' to myself 
 I keep 'em talkin' from daylight 'til dawn 
 'Til you're out of my bones 
 Sweet amnesia come and set me free 
 I just need to get you out of me 
 Bury your jacket in my backyard 
 Carry your picture in my shoe 
 And keep walkin' 'til the hurting stops 
 Keep walkin' 'til my temperature drops 
 Keep walkin' 'til the fever is gone 
 And you're out of my bones

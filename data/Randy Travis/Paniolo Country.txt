Places I have been, cities I have seen, 
 With concrete canyons rising from the ground. 
 Miles and miles of asphalt trail, 
 Stretch across the land, stampeding metal ponies 
 Leaving smoke along the way. 
 Going back to Paniolo county, 
 Stars at night no city lights. 
 Paniolo country, my home on the range. 
 I made up my mind, won't waste any time 
 Going back to where the clouds ride high. 
 Take my word its pretty, not like the great big city 
 The winds still bring cool clear mountian air. 
 Going back to paniolo country 
 Rain drops fall, the grass grows tall 
 Paniolo county, my home on the range. 
 Places I have been, cities I have seen, 
 With concrete canyons rising from the ground. 
 Miles and miles of asphalt trail, 
 Stretch across a land, stampeding metal ponies 
 Leaving smoke along the way... 
 Going back to Paniolo county, 
 Stars at night no city lights. 
 Paniolo country, my home on the range 
 Paniolo county, Rain drops fall, the grass grows tall 
 Paniolo county, my home on the range.

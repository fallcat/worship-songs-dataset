Well, I'm tired and so weary 
 But I must go along 
 'Til the Lord comes and calls me away 
 Where the morning's so bright 
 And the Lamb is the light 
 And the night, night is as fair as the day 
 There will be peace in the valley 
 For me some day 
 There will be peace in the valley 
 For me, oh Lord, I pray 
 There'll be no sadness 
 No sorrow, no trouble I see 
 There will be peace 
 In the valley for me 
 Well, the flowers will be blooming 
 And the grass will be green 
 And the skies will be clear and serene 
 Where the sun ever beams 
 In this valley of dreams 
 And no cloud will be seen 
 There will be peace in the valley 
 For me some day 
 There will be peace in the valley 
 For me, Oh Lord. I pray 
 There'll be no sadness 
 No sorrow, no trouble I see 
 There will be peace 
 In the valley for me 
 Well, the bear will be gentle 
 And the wolf will be tame 
 And the lion shall lay down 
 By the lamb, oh 
 And the beasts from the wild 
 Shall be led by a child 
 And I'll be changed 
 Changed from this creature that I am 
 There will be peace in the valley 
 For me some day 
 There will be peace in the valley 
 For me, Oh Lord I pray 
 There'll be no sadness 
 No sorrow, no trouble I see 
 There will be peace 
 In the valley for me

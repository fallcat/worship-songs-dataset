A long time ago 
 A million years BC 
 The best things in life 
 Were absolutely free 
 But no one appreciated 
 A sky that was always blue 
 And no one congratulated 
 A moon that was always new 
 So it was planned that they would vanish now and them 
 And you must pay before you get them back again 
 That's what storms were made for 
 And you shouldn't be afraid for 
 Every time it rains, it rains 
 Pennies from Heaven 
 Don't you know each cloud contains 
 Pennies from Heaven 
 You'll find your fortune falling 
 All over town 
 Be sure that your umbrella 
 Is upside down 
 Trade them for a package of 
 Sunshine and flowers 
 If you want the things you love 
 You must have showers 
 So when you hear it thunder 
 Don't run under a tree 
 There'll be pennies from Heaven 
 For you and me 
 You must have showers 
 So when you hear it thunder 
 Don't run under a tree 
 There'll be pennies from Heaven 
 For you and me

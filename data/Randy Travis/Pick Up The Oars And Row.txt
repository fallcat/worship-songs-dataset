What good does it do to hold onto 
 The anger deep in your heart 
 You're the only one that it's hurting 
 You're the one that it's tearing apart 
 I'm sorry that he broke your heart girl 
 But it's time to let it go 
 Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row 
 He shattered your expectations 
 He broke all his promises too 
 With his little white lies he looked in your eyes 
 And made you believe they were true 
 Aw but this ain't the final curtain 
 Girl it's time to get on the show 
 Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row 
 It's been far too long now 
 Since I've seen your smile 
 Your bitterness don't look good on you 
 And self pity just ain't your style 
 Sooner or later you know you've got to play the card you've drawn 
 It's all up to you 
 You can stay blue or you can move on 
 Ain't it hard when you discover 
 Things ain't what you thought they would be 
 When all of your best played plans 
 Hit the wall of reality 
 Still all in all it's a good life 
 But it sure can be painful I know 
 Sometimes love is a river of tears pick up the oars and row 
 Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and go

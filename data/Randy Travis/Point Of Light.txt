There is a point when you cannot walk away, 
 When you have to stand up straight and tall and mean the word you say. 
 There is a point you must decide just to do it 'cause it's right. 
 That's when you become a point of light. 
 There is a darkness that everyone must face. 
 It wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste. 
 And that darkness covers everything in sight 
 Until it meets a single point of light. 
 All it takes is a point of light, 
 A ray of hope in the darkest night. 
 If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right, 
 You will be a point of light. 
 There are heroes whose names we never hear, 
 A dedicated army of quiet volunteers 
 Reaching out to feed the hungry, 
 Reaching out to save the land, 
 Reaching out to help their fellow man. 
 There are dreamers who are making dreams come true, 
 Taking time to to teach the children 
 There's nothing they can't do, 
 Giving shelter to the homeless, 
 Giving hope to those without. 
 Isn't that what this land's all about? 
 One by one, from the mountains to the sea 
 Points of light are calling out to you and me. 
 All it takes is a point of light, 
 A ray of hope in the darkest night. 
 If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right, 
 You will be a point of light. 
 If you see what's wrong and you try and make it right, 
 You will be a point of light.

Everybody gathered where the river runs wider 
 At the edge of town 
 To see if that eddie lee vaughn baptism 
 Was really gonna go down 
 Folks bet hard earned money 
 That water wouldn't change a thing 
 They set the odds at a hundred to one 
 His soul wouldn't never come clean 
 Then the preacher said 
 People take a moment or two 
 There something we need to do 
 Pray for the fish 
 They won't know what's coming 
 When the sin starts rolling off the likes of him 
 Lord be with em, they ain't done nothin' 
 Please wont you leave them just a little bit a room to swim 
 Pray for the fish 
 Well the preacher ducked 'em under 
 That cool clear water 
 Then he did it again 
 Eddie came up yelling 
 Lord in heaven halleauh! 
 I'm a brand new man 
 Well the water got to bubbling 
 Sky got to rumbling 
 And the thunder backed up the choir 
 The fish started jumpin' 
 It was like they was swimmin' 
 In a lake of fire 
 Then eddie's momma stepped out of the crowd 
 And started yelling out loud 
 Pray for the fish 
 They won't know what's coming 
 When the sin starts rolling 
 Off the likes of him 
 Lord be with' em 
 They ain't done nothing 
 Please wont you leave em 
 Just a little bit a room to swim 
 Pray for the fish 
 He said everybody cross your fingers 
 Fold your hands 
 Pray for ole' eddie 
 But before we say amen 
 Pray for the fish 
 Lord be with em 
 They ain't done nothin' 
 Please wont you leave em 
 Just a little bit a room to swim 
 Pray for the fish 
 Lord pray for the fish

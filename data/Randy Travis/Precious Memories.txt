Precious memories, unseen angels 
 Sent from somewhere to my soul 
 How they linger ever near me 
 And the sacred scenes unfold 
 Precious memories, how they linger 
 How they ever flood my soul 
 In the stillness of the midnight 
 Precious sacred scenes unfold 
 Precious father, loving mother 
 Fly across the lonely years 
 And old home scenes of my childhood 
 In fond memory appear 
 Precious memories, how they linger 
 How they ever flood my soul 
 In the stillness of the midnight 
 Precious sacred scenes unfold 
 As I travel on life's pathway 
 Know not what the years may hold 
 And as I ponder hope grows fonder 
 Precious memories flood my soul 
 Precious memories, how they linger 
 How they ever flood my soul 
 In the stillness of the midnight 
 Precious sacred scenes unfold 
 Precious sacred scenes unfold

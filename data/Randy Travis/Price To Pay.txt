I wonder how we got like this 
 Your heart wasn't mine to take 
 Mine wasn't mine to give 
 And love wasn't ours to save 
 I shoulda let you when I could 
 When the memories 
 Weren't so many or so good 
 And one night was such a small price to pay 
 A small price to pay 
 When a touch was all it was 
 When the fire was just a candle flame 
 Throwing shadows of us 
 What I wouldn't give now 
 For those long gone yesterdays 
 When one night was such a small price to pay 
 Well I guess we'd better go 
 Maybe this time for good 
 But the last time wasn't though 
 But never again sure feels good to say 
 And I think back to the times 
 When everything I treasured wasn't on this fragile mind 
 And one night was such a small price to pay 
 A small price to pay 
 When a touch was all it was 
 When the fire was just a candle flame 
 Throwing shadows of us 
 What I wouldn't give now 
 For those long gone yesterdays 
 When one night was such a small price to pay 
 Back when one night was such a small price to pay

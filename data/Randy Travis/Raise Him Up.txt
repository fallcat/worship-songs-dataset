When I first met his momma 
 She was just 19 
 She couldn't say for certain who the father was 
 I have known him every since he was a pup 
 And I'm gonna raise him up 
 If you never knew your daddy 
 Like I never knew mine 
 It feels like everybody knows your fatherless 
 This boy may not be blood of my blood 
 But I'm gonna raise him up 
 I'll provide for him 
 Walk beside of him 
 I am strong enough 
 Cause its time he knew 
 What a son can do 
 With a fathers love 
 He can change the world 
 Y'all may have to look at joseph 
 A couple thousand years ago 
 When he held a newborn baby he named Jesus 
 He said he may not be blood of my blood 
 Still I'm gonna raise him up 
 I'll provide for him 
 Walk beside of him 
 I am strong enough 
 I will show him too 
 What a son can do 
 With a fathers love 
 And he will change the world 
 33 years later 
 When the son was in his grave 
 Broken and abandoned by a world he came to save 
 His real dad said he's 
 Blood of my blood 
 And I'm gonna raise him up 
 I'll provide for you 
 Walk beside of you 
 I am strong enough 
 I have seen from you 
 What a son can do 
 With a fathers love 
 One man changed the world 
 And he can change your world 
 But you gotta raise him up 
 Raise him up

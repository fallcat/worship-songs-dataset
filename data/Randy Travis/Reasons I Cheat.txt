A working day too long, when everything goes wrong 
 And a boss who don't know I'm alive 
 I once had a notion I'd get that promotion 
 But now I barely survive 
 A wife too demanding, with no understanding 
 Of why I stay dead on my feet 
 Adinly lit tavern, a willing youg woman 
 Are some of the reasons I cheat 
 My children keep growin' 
 My age keeps on showin' 
 Like all of my old friends I meet 
 So I'm gettig older 
 Ny life's growing colder 
 Just some of the reasons I cheat 
 The hair that I'm losing and a woman who's choosing 
 To lay sound asleep by my side 
 The bills they are mounting, that's when I start counting 
 On smoeone to help soothe my pride 
 A lady that knows me, affection she shows me 
 And a smile so easy and sweet 
 The dreams that I've buried, the load that I carry 
 Are some of the reasons I cheat 
 My children keep growin' 
 My age keeps on showin' 
 Like all of my old friends I meet 
 So I'm gettig older 
 Ny life's growing colder 
 Just some of the reasons I cheat

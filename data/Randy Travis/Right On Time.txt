It's not my nature to be patient 
 I jump every river I cross 
 Not one for following the sensible signs 
 I can't count the times I been lost 
 Well you can't see where your going in the pouren rain, 
 When your runnin' into walls and feelen no pain. 
 We have all done time with the devil 
 And I've done mine 
 It took awhile to get here 
 But I'm right on time. 
 I may still regret some moments 
 But it's just part of a ride 
 I count myself among the fortunate ones 
 Who made it to the other side. 
 Well you go what you go through to get where you are 
 Lucky for me I didn't go to far 
 I turned around before the end of the line 
 Took awhile to get here 
 But I'm right on time. 
 Well you can't see where your going in the pouren rain, 
 When your runnin' into walls and feelen no pain. 
 We have all done time with the devil 
 And I've done mine 
 It took awhile to get here 
 But I'm right on time 
 It took awhile to get here 
 But I'm right on time...

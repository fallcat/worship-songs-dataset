A baby in a manger, the town of Bethlehem 
 The wise men had the heart to know He was the great I Am 
 They crossed the desert many miles to kneel down at His feet 
 The star that led them seemed to tell them what had come to be 
 The Son's gonna rise and shine 
 Make the lame walk, the deaf talk, and give sight back to the blind. 
 Bring a light into the darkness no one can deny 
 As sure as there's a heaven, the Son's gonna rise and shine 
 At the age of thirty-three, the prophecy fulfilled 
 On the cross at Calvary His blood for man was spilled 
 The sky was black as midnight, but 'neath the dark and gloom 
 Voices rang and angels sang dancing 'round the tomb 
 The Sons's gonna rise and shine 
 He'll take away the keys of death, the grave will loose its bind 
 Hell will be defeated in three days of time 
 On resurrection morning, the Son's gonna rise and shine 
 It's been two thousand years, but the story's still the same 
 For those who will believe in Him and call upon His name 
 The Son's gonna rise and shine 
 Heal the sick, raise the dead, the Savior of mankind 
 The day will soon be dawning will be the end of time 
 King of kings, Lord of lords, The Son's gonna rise and shine 
 Jesus, Son of Glory will save your soul and mine 
 Brother are you ready, the Son's gonna rise and shine.

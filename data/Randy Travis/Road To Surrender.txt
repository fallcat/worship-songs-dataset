Dear Lord, I've heard You know when somebody gets hits the bottom of their soul. 
 Oh Lord, I hope You see something that's worth saving when You look at me. 
 Because I have no fight left in me now. 
 I bring my pride and I lay it down. 
 And on my knees, here at Your feet, I'll give you all that's left of me. 
 Oh Lord, this weary, broken sinner is on a road to surrender. 
 My life is in Your hands. 
 They say no one can fix broken like You can. 
 Help me let it go, all the guilt that's held me under its control. 
 I have no fight left in me now. 
 I bring my pride and lay it down. 
 And on my knees, here at Your feet, I'll give you all that's of me. 
 Oh Lord, this weary, broken sinner is on the road to surrender. 
 I don't know how to pray, or what I'm supposed to say. 
 Because here they call it faith, but Lord I'm so afraid. 
 Because I have no fight left in me now. 
 I bring my pride and lay it down. 
 And on my knees, here at your feet, I'll give you all that's of me. 
 Oh Lord, this weary, broken sinner is on the road to surrender. 
 Oh Lord, this weary, broken sinner is on a road to surrender.

I'm roamin' Wyomin' 
 Dreamin' of your chestnut hair 
 And eyes of sparklin' blue 
 So I keep roamin' Wyomin' 
 And hopin' that my roamin' 
 Leads me home to you 
 I left Aberdeen 
 On a cattle drive last spring 
 I was just another hand 
 Ridin' through the old bad lands 
 There was dust and there was mud 
 There was sweat and there was blood 
 But after all this time 
 You still prey upon my mind 
 I'm roamin' Wyomin' 
 Dreamin' of your chestnut hair 
 And eyes of sparklin' blue 
 So I keep roamin' Wyomin' 
 And hopin' that my roamin' 
 Leads me home to you 
 Sleepin' on an old bed roll 
 Eatin' beans and sourdough 
 The days are lonely and they're long 
 I'm wonderin' why I hired on 
 We round 'em up and move 'em out 
 As I point my saddle south 
 This big Wyomin' sky 
 Sure is blue and so am I 
 I keep roamin' Wyomin' 
 Dreamin' of your chestnut hair 
 And eyes of sparklin' blue 
 So I keep roamin' Wyomin' 
 And hopin' that my roamin' 
 Leads me home to you 
 I keep roamin' Wyomin' 
 And hopin' that my roamin' 
 Leads me home to you

Baby our love is, our love is, 
 Like a runaway train 
 Baby it won't stop, won't stop, 
 Or slow down for anything 
 Baby it's big, so strong, love is a powerful thing 
 Baby our love is, our love is, like a runaway train 
 Baby our love reminds me, reminds me, of a runaway train. 
 Baby our love is, our love is, like a hurricane 
 Baby it won't stop, won't stop, won't slow down for anything 
 Baby it's so big, so strong, love is a powerful thing 
 Baby our love is, our love is, like a hurricane 
 Baby our love reminds me, reminds me, of a hurricane. 
 Our love is red hot, non-stop, all the way to the top 
 Now that I been in the middle of this thing 
 Ain't no way I'm ever gonna go back 
 Seen everything, I been everywhere, 
 I didn't leave nothin' that I want back there 
 Come on, baby lets move this thing 
 A little farther down the track. 
 Baby our love is, our love is, like a jet airplane 
 Baby it won't stop, won't stop, or slow down for anything 
 Flying so high above, in all the pouring rain 
 Baby our love is, our love is, like a jet airplane 
 Baby our love reminds me, reminds me, of a jet airplane. 
 Our love is red hot, non-stop, all the way to the top 
 Now that I been in the middle of this thing 
 Ain't no way, I'm ever gonna go back 
 I've Seen everything, I been everywhere, 
 I didn't leave nothin' that I want back there 
 So Come on, baby lets move this thing 
 A little farther down the track.

 Baby our love reminds me, reminds me, of a runaway train. 
 Lady our love is, our love is, like a runaway train.

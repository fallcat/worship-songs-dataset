At a quick shop somewhere west of Albuquerque 
 Got a tank of gas and a cold drink and a beef jerky 
 The cashier she gave me a smile 
 So I stood there and I talk to her a while 
 She said where you headed I hope you get there soon 
 I've seen 'em all day long from 4am till noon 
 Some are running from 
 Some are running too 
 Some are running blind 
 Lord 
 Which one are you 
 I said it don't appear to me to be so cut and dry 
 You don't know me from Adam 
 Can it be so black and white 
 I said I got a plan you see I got it figured out 
 How can you be so sure my dear what I'm all about 
 She said I've stood in this window for 27 years 
 I can tell your cash or credit 
 I can tell your brand of beer 
 I can tell you who's a liar 
 And the truth is plain to see 
 That's your last twenty boy 
 And don't you lie to me 
 Their's a girl 
 In Albuquerque crying (ain't she) 
 And your standing in a quick shop 
 Lying'(Ain't ya) 
 Well 
 She handed back my twenty 
 Said you know what to do 
 If you drive it steady son 
 You'll be home this afternoon 
 And I hate to judge you 
 I don't mean to seem unkind 
 But there ain't no use in running 
 If you're only running blind 
 Oh their ain't no use in running... 
 If you're only running blind.

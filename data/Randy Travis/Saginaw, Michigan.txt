I was born in Saginaw Michigan 
 I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay 
 My dad was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman 
 Too many times he came home with too little pay 
 I love a girl in Saginaw Michigan 
 The daughter of a wealthy wealthy man 
 But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman 
 Not good enough to claim his daughters hand 
 Now I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold 
 Like a crazy fool I'm digging in this frozen ground so cold 
 But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then 
 I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan 
 I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan 
 I said Honey I'm coming home please wait for me 
 You can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man 
 I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history 
 Her dad met me in Saginaw Michigan 
 He gave me a great big party with champagne 
 Then he said Son you're a wise young ambitious man 
 Will you sell you're father in law your Klondike claim 
 Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold cold ground 
 The greedy fool is lookin' for the gold I never found 
 It serves him right and no one here is missing him 
 Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan 
 The happiest man and wife in Saginaw Michigan

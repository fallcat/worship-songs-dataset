Oh! You better watch out, 
 You better not cry, 
 You better not pout, 
 I'm telling you why: 
 Santa Claus is coming to town! 
 He's making a list, 
 He's checking it twice, 
 Gonna find out who's naughty or nice. 
 Santa Claus is coming to town! 
 He sees you when you're sleeping, 
 He knows when you're awake. 
 He knows if you've been bad or good, 
 So be good for goodness sake! 
 So... You better watch out, You better not cry 
 You better not pout, I'm telling you why. 
 Santa Claus is coming to town 
 The kids in girl and boy land 
 Will have a jubilee. 
 They're gonna build a toy land. 
 All around the Christmas tree. 
 Oh! You better watch out, 
 You better not cry, 
 You better not pout, 
 I'm telling you why: 
 Santa Claus is coming to town! 
 Santa Claus is coming to town!...

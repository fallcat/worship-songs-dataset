Many more miles were behind him 
 Than he had left to go 
 Closing in upon that last one 
 We all must walk alone 
 It's the one across the end of the line 
 So we held on and we told stories 
 Of the good and bad in all 
 Of the power and the glory 
 And the lonely days that crawled 
 He said heaven holds true love 
 And a satisfied mind. 
 He said I ain't afraid of dying 
 'Cause I know there's something worse 
 When you have to see your reason for livin' go first 
 And you get left behind 
 Some can't think of nothing better 
 Than to live this life forever 
 I never wanted no more than was mine 
 And to lay down someday and go home 
 With a satisfied mind. 
 He said don't look into the darkness 
 If you want to see true black 
 Look into a morning's brightness 
 When love ain't coming back 
 You will find right there a darkness that blinds 
 And don't think wealth is ever having 
 All you want all to yourself 
 It is found when you are giving 
 What you have to someone else 
 The only difference in the rich and the poor 
 Is a satisfied mind. 
 And one light began to fade 
 As one grew brighter 
 And he said I ain't afraid of dying 
 'Cause I know there's something worse 
 When you have to see your reason for livin' go first 
 And you get left behind. 
 Some can't think of nothing better 
 Than to live this life forever 
 I never wanted no more than was mine 
 And to lay down someday and go home 
 Let me lay down someday and go home 
 With a satisfied mind...

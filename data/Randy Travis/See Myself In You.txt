If I met you on the corner 
 Would I know you as you are? 
 Would I take you for a stranger 
 And brush past you in the door? 
 If you called me would I hear you 
 Or would I walk away too soon? 
 If I lingered for a moment 
 Would I see myself in you? 
 If I fought you like a soldier 
 If I had you in my sights 
 Would you ask me to remember 
 Who imagined I was right? 
 If you witnessed my surrender 
 Do I know what I would do? 
 If you held me like my brother 
 Would I see myself in you? 
 Well I dreamed my end was near 
 I was almost gone 
 If I dream that dream from here 
 Can I still come home? 
 If you called me would I hear you 
 Do I know what would I do? 
 If you held me like my Father 
 Would I see myself in you? 
 If you held me like my Father 
 Would I see myself in you?

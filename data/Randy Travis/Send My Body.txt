Well that judge he found me guilty of wrong doing 
 And he sentenced me to hang in mid July 
 He look down at me and said you're lifes a ruin 
 If I were you I'd break right down and cry 
 But nobody seems to care that I ain't guilty 
 'Cause I never did the things they said I've done 
 But I guess they're gonna have to hang somebody 
 And It's lookin' like I'm goin' to be the one 
 So send my body home on a freight train 
 And don't worry none that I don't go first class 
 Send my body home on a freight train 
 So everyone can see me when I pass 
 And don't worry none about no fancy funeral 
 It don't matter how they lay me down 
 Just see they bury me out by mama's apple tree 
 And send my body back to my home town 
 My mama was one damn hard workin' woman 
 She tried to raise us kids without a pa 
 The last thing that she said she was on her dying bed 
 Was son don't get in trouble with the law 
 Whenever my time comes to meet my maker 
 I'm going to try to do my very best 
 I'm going try to stand and take it like a man 
 When they ask if I have one request 
 I'll just say ... 
 Send my body home on a freight train 
 And don't worry none that I don't go first class 
 Send my body home on a freight train 
 So everyone can see me when I pass 
 And don't worry none about no fancy funeral 
 'Cause it don't matter how they lay me down 
 Just See they bury me out by mama's apple tree 
 And send my body back to my home town 
 Yes, just see they bury me out by mama's apple tree 
 And send my body back to my home town...

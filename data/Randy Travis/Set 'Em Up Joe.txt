They got a vintage Victoria 1951 
 Full of my favorite records that I grew up on 
 They got ole Hank and Lefty and there's B-24 
 Set 'em up Joe and play Walking the Floor 
 Set 'em up Joe and play Walking the Floor 
 I'm gonna spend the night like every night before 
 Play an ET and I'll play 'em some more 
 I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours 
 Set 'em up Joe and play Walking The Floor 
 Set 'em up Joe and play Walking The Floor 
 All my neon neighbors they like what I play 
 'Cause they've heard it every night since you've walked away 
 Everyday they replace ole B-24 
 'Cause every night I run a needle through Walking the Floor 
 Every night I run a needle through Walking the Floor 
 I'm gonna spend the night like every night before 
 Play an ET and I'll play 'em some more 
 I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours 
 Set 'em up Joe and play Walking The Floor 
 Set 'em up Joe and play Walking The Floor

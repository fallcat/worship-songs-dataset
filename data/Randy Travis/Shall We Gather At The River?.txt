Shall we gather at the river 
 Where bright angels feet have trod 
 With it's crystal tides forever 
 Flowing by the throne of God. 
 Yes, we'll gather at that river 
 The beautiful, the beautiful river 
 Gather with the saints at that river 
 That flows by the throne of God. 
 When we reach that shining river 
 We'll lay every burden down 
 Then grace our spirits will deliver 
 And will receive our robe and crown. 
 Yes, we'll gather at that river 
 The beautiful, the beautiful river 
 Gather with the saints at that river 
 That flows by the throne of God. 
 Soon we'll reach that silver river 
 Soon our pilgrimage will cease 
 Soon our happy hearts will quiver 
 With the melody of peace. 
 Yes, we'll gather at that river 
 The beautiful, the beautiful river 
 Gather with the saints at that river 
 That flows by the throne of God. 
 Oh yes, we'll gather at that river 
 That flows by the throne of God 
 That flows by the throne of God

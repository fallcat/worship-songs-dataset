I will not drown in shallow water 
 Not with Your love within my reach 
 I did not come this far to falter 
 And will not rest until I'm free 
 You are the sun, You are the flower 
 You are the wind across the sea 
 And I will kneel here at Your altar 
 And pray You'll take my soul to keep 
 Oh, precious one You are the mountain 
 You are the earth beneath my feet 
 In you we're one now and forever 
 In You I find the love in me 
 Through Your love my eyes are open 
 Through Your love I'll learn to see 
 And in Your name my bread is broken 
 By Your grace I'll rest in peace 
 I will not drown in shallow water 
 Not with Your love within my reach 
 I did not come this far to falter 
 And will not rest until I'm free 
 Through Your love my eyes are open 
 Through Your love I'll learn to see 
 And in Your name my bread is broken 
 By Your grace I'll rest in peace 
 I will not drown in shallow water 
 Not with Your love within my reach 
 I did not come this far to falter 
 And will not rest until I'm free 
 I will not drown in shallow water 
 Not with Your love within my reach 
 I did not come this far to falter 
 And will not rest until I'm free 
 I will not rest until I'm free 
 Until I'm free

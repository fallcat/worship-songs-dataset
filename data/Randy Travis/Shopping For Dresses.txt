Down through the ages men have died for women 
 And done so for many times 
 Each time I loved one, I ve always lost one 
 Seems the right one is so hard to find. 
 Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them 
 One in each color, one in each style. 
 I ll find a lady someday to wear them, 
 My shopping will be done for awhile. 
 I ll bet somewhere s a lady shopping for britches 
 Comparing the value, appraising each pair. 
 Maybe someday the Lord will bring us together 
 And we ll both have a new wardrobe to wear 
 Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them 
 One in each color and one in each style. 
 Maybe someday if I'm lucky 
 I ll find someone to wear them 
 And my shopping will be done for awhile. 
 My shopping will be done for awhile. 
 I m looking for a lady who ll look good in dresses 
 She must be red-headed, green eyes and be fair. 
 I ll make exceptions to all my requirements 
 As long as she s willing to care. 
 I just saw a beauty with blue eyes, what a cutie 
 Bond hair like a halo around her did flow, 
 But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely 
 In the dresses I bought long ago. 
 Now as I sit here dreaming, planning and scheming, 
 Why should I make standards when everyone knows 
 As your need ranges, women make changes 
 And you must accept them or just let them go.

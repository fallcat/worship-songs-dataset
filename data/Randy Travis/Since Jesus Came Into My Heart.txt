What a wonderful change in my life has been brought 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 I had lied in my soul for so long I had sought 
 When Jesus came into my heart 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Floods of joy fill my soul 
 Like when sea billows roll 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Floods of joy fill my soul 
 Like when sea billows roll 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Ah, since Jesus came into my heart 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Floods of joy fill my soul 
 Like when sea billows roll 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Ah, since Jesus came into my heart 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Floods of joy fill my soul 
 Like when sea billows roll 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Ah, since Jesus came into my heart 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Floods of joy fill my soul 
 Like when sea billows roll 
 Since Jesus came into my heart 
 Floods of joy filled my soul 
 Like when sea billows roll 
 Since Jesus came into my heart

Well, I never felt more like singing the blues 
 'Cause I never thought 
 That I'd ever lose, your love dear 
 Why did you do me this way 
 Well, I never felt more like crying all night 
 'Cause everything's wrong 
 And nothing is right, without you 
 You got me singing the blues 
 Well, the moon and stars no longer shine 
 The dream is gone out from my mind 
 There's nothing left for me to do 
 But cry-y-y over you 
 Well, I never felt more like running away 
 But why should I go 
 'Cause I couldn't stay, without you 
 You got me singing the blues. 
 I never felt more like singing the blues 
 'Cause I never thought 
 That I'd ever lose, your love dear 
 Why did you do me this way 
 Well, I never felt more like crying all night 
 'Cause everything's wrong 
 And nothing is right, without you 
 You got me singing the blues 
 Well the moon and stars no longer shine 
 The dream is gone out from my mind 
 There's nothing left for me to do 
 But cry-y-y over you 
 Well, I never felt more, like running away 
 But why should I go 
 'Cause I couldn't stay, without you 
 You got me singing the blues...

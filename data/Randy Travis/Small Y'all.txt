Honey, you think he's got an attitude 
 So you treat him just a little too rude 
 Buddy, you think she's a little too cold 
 So you act like a two-year old 
 Don't it make you feel low, Joe? 
 Don't it make you feel mean, Jean? 
 Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourselves? 
 Don't it make you feel small, y'all? 
 Boy, you say somethin' bad about her brother 
 Girl, you say somethin' mean about his mother 
 Tempers flare and insults fly 
 And you're both just wantin' to die 
 Don't you feel like a jerk, Kirk? 
 Don't you feel like a ninny, Ginny? 
 Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourselves? 
 Don't it make you feel small, y'all? 
 Now lady, you say you don't love him no more 
 But Mister, you kick down the bedroom door 
 She calls you names you never heard before 
 And now it's a full-scale war 
 Don't it make you feel crazy, Daisy? 
 Mentally ill, Bill? 
 Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourselves? 
 Don't it make you feel small, y'all? 
 Six o'clock, eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten 
 The neighbors all know that you're at it again 
 And two little kids just a few feet away 
 Hear every word you say 
 Don't it make you feel bad, dad? 
 Don't it make you feel wrong, mom? 
 Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourselves? 
 Don't it make you feel small, y'all? 
 Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourselves? 
 Don't it make you feel small, y'all?

I was ten years old on my grandpa's farm when it happened 
 After all these years I can still hear grandpa laughin' 
 As he applied that barnyard remedy 
 He passed his wisdom down to me 
 You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive 
 I remember my first crush was on the preacher's daughter 
 We were smoochin' on the front porch swing that night when he caught her 
 We weren't expectin' him home until quarter past ten 
 When the good Lord taught me that lesson again 
 You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive 
 You don't point your pistol before you check each chamber 
 And you don't drink no you don't drink when you drive 
 It's just ordinary common sense to avoid that danger 
 You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive 
 She rolled into town with rodeo, she was a beauty 
 And that cowboy saw you wink at her, she was a cutie 
 The sound of jinglin' spurs caught me dead on a run 
 He was fit to be tied and you were under the gun 
 You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive 
 No, you don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive 
 You're gonna get stung boy

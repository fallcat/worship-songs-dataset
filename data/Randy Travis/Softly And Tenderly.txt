Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling 
 Calling for you and for me 
 See on the portal he's waiting and watching 
 Watching for you and for me. 
 Come home, come home 
 Ye who are weary come home 
 Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling 
 Calling, oh sinner, come home. 
 (Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading) 
 Pleading for you and for me 
 (Why should we linger and heed not his calling) 
 Calling for you and for me. 
 Come home, come home 
 Ye who are weary come home 
 Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling 
 Calling, oh sinner, come home...

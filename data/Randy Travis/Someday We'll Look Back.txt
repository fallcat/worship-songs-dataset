Someday when our dream world finds us 
 And these hard times are gone 
 We'll laugh and count our blessings 
 In a mansion all our own 
 If we both pull together tomorrow's sure to come 
 Someday we'll look back and say it was fun 
 We live on love and pennies 
 And the day dream out of sight 
 And I'm amazed the way you smile 
 When things don't turn out right 
 We climb each hill together each step one by one 
 And someday we'll look back and say it was fun 
 Someday when our dream world finds us 
 And these hard times are gone 
 We'll laugh and count our blessings 
 In a mansion all our own 
 If we both pull together tomorrow's sure to come 
 Someday we'll look back and say it was fun 
 And someday we'll look back and say it was fun

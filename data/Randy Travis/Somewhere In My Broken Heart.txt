You've made up your mind it was time, it was over 
 After we had come so far 
 But I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness 
 Somewhere in my broken heart 
 I would not have chosen the road you have taken 
 It has left us miles apart 
 But I think I can still find a will to keep goin' 
 Somewhere in my broken heart 
 So fly, go ahead and fly 
 Until you find out who you are 
 'Cause I, will keep my love unspoken 
 Somewhere in my broken heart 
 I hope that in time you will find what you longed for 
 Love that's written in the stars 
 And when you finally do I think you will see it 
 Somewhere in my broken heart 
 So fly, go ahead and fly 
 Until you find out who you are 
 'Cause I, will keep my love unspoken 
 Somewhere in my broken heart 
 I hope that in time you will find what you longed for 
 Love that's written in the stars 
 And when you finally do I think you will see it 
 Somewhere in my broken heart 
 Somewhere in my broken heart

There's a stranger in my mirror 
 Who don't know how to behave 
 He keeps grinnin' 'bout you 
 And whistlin' tunes 
 While he ought to be watchin' me shave 
 We move alike and we look the same 
 But I swear we've got totally different brains 
 And the love we're in with you just makes it clearer 
 He used to be my twin 
 Now there's a stranger in my mirror 
 And he doesn't want to go out drinkin' 
 With all of his friends, no more 
 He's got both of us thinkin' 
 You're what we're livin' for 
 We've gone crazy and we can't recover 
 You're always on one mind or the other 
 I admit we should be certified 
 He's a little schizophrenic and so am I 
 There's a stranger in my mirror 
 Who don't know how to behave 
 He keeps grinnin' 'bout you 
 And whistlin' tunes 
 While he ought to be watchin' me shave 
 We move alike and we look the same 
 But I swear we've got totally different brains 
 And the love we're in with you just makes it clearer 
 He used to be my twin 
 Now there's a stranger in my mirror 
 And he's always doin' little things 
 I never thought I'd do 
 Like lookin' at diamond rings 
 Drawin' hearts and writin' I love you's 
 Thought it was just a case of mild affection 
 Until I caught a glimpse of my reflection 
 I looked up into my own eyes 
 And saw someone starin' back I didn't recognize 
 There's a stranger in my mirror 
 Who don't know how to behave 
 He keeps grinnin' 'bout you 
 And whistlin' tunes 
 While he ought to be watchin' me shave 
 We move alike and we look the same 
 But I swear we've got totally different brains 
 And the love we're in with you just makes it clearer 
 He used to be my twin 
 Now there's a stranger in my mirror 
 Lord, I'm in love with you 
 And there's a stranger in my mirror...

There's a land that is fairer than day 
 And by faith we can see it afar 
 And the father 
 Waits over the way 
 To prepare us a dwelling place there. 
 In the sweet by and by 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore 
 In the sweet by and by 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
 To our bountiful father above 
 We will offer our tribute of praise 
 For the glorious gift of his love 
 And the blessings that hallow our days. 
 In the sweet by and by 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore 
 In the sweet by and by 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
 In the sweet by and by 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore 
 In the sweet by and by 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore...

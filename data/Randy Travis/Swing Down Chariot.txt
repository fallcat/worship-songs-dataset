Well, well, well, well 
 I look over yonder and what I see 
 Seems like a chariot coming after me 
 Swing low sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home 
 Why don't you swing down chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Swing down chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord, calm and easy 
 I got a home on the other side 
 Swing, swing, swing 
 Well, Ezekiel was out in the middle of the field 
 He said he saw an angel with a chariot wheel 
 He wasn't too particular about the chariot wheel 
 He just wanted to see how a chariot feels 
 Why don't you swing down chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Swing down chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord, calm and easy 
 I got a home on the other side 
 Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing 
 Well, Ezekiel went down and he got on board 
 The chariot went bumping on down the road 
 Zeke wasn't particular about the bumpin' of the road 
 He just wanted to lay down his heavy load 
 Why don't you swing down chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Swing down chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord, calm and easy 
 I got a home on the other side 
 Well, I got a Father in the promised land 
 And I ain't stopping till I shake His hand 
 Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord, calm and easy 
 I got a home on the other side 
 Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Swing down chariot, stop and let me ride 
 Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord, calm and easy 
 I got a home on the other side

Hey mister, don't you know you're gonna lose her if you're always workin' 
 I know you're thinking maybe you can buy her everything she's ever wanted 
 But what she really wants is some T.L.C. 
 Women spell love T.I.M.E. 
 You can get rich, you can make that money 
 But one of these days you're gonna find your honey 
 On the other side of town in a rented double-wide 
 With some ole' boy that's got nothin' but time 
 Slow down, smell the roses and the coffee 
 Don't you let her get lonely 
 Call her up just to tell her and remind her 
 She's your one and only 
 Keep workin' late and one night you'll see 
 Women spell love T.I.M.E 
 Hold her hand, take a walkin', do some talkin' 
 And a whole lotta listenin' 
 It won't be long till you get a little taste 
 Of what you've really been missin' 
 They say the best things in life are free 
 Women spell love T.I.M.E 
 You can get rich, you can make that money 
 But one of these days you're gonna find your honey 
 On the other side of town in a rented double-wide 
 With some ole' boy that's got nothin' but time 
 Take off next Friday, spend the weekend 
 Acting like you got forever 
 She won't care where you're goin', what you're doin' 
 Just as long as you're together 
 It 'ain't as simple as 1,4.3 
 Women spell love T.I.M.E. 
 Work 'ain't enough, she wants T.L.C. 
 Women spell love T.I.M.E. 
 Hey, Josh, don't you know you're gonna lose her 
 Slow down, smell the roses and the coffee 
 Hold her hand, do some walkin' and some talkin' 
 T.I.M.E. 
 Women spell love T.I.M.E. 
 Women spell love Josh and Randy 
 Women spell love 
 T.I.M.E.

I know I sent you packin' 
 But now I want you back again 
 Livin' without you ain't no livin' at all 
 How I miss your naggin' 
 And your tongue a-waggin' 
 And the crash of the coffee cup 
 Up against the bedroom wall 
 In the kitchen early in the mornin' 
 Midnight walkin' the floor 
 Without your cryin', cussin' and your moanin' 
 Home ain't home anymore 
 So come on, honey 
 Come home and spend my money 
 Come back, mama, and take another swing at me 
 I told my friends how I sent you runnin' 
 Cause you didn't do me right 
 But if I looked up and saw you comin' 
 You could do me wrong all night 
 So come on, honey 
 Come home and spend my money 
 Come back, mama, and take another swing at me 
 Come back, mama, and take another swing at me 
 Come back, mama, and take another swing at me 
 Take another swing at me...

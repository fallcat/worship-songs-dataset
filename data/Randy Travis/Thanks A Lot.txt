Thanks, thanks a lot 
 I got a broken heart that's all I got 
 You made me cry and I cried a lot 
 I lost your love honey thanks a lot 
 You told our friends I was passing by 
 That you're not sorry that you made me cry 
 You said I deserved just what I got 
 Well if that's how you feel honey thanks a lot 
 Thanks, thanks a lot 
 I got a broken heart that's all I got 
 You made me cry and I cried a lot 
 I lost your love honey thanks a lot 
 You wanted a fool and I played the part 
 Now all I've got is a broken heart 
 We loved a little and you laughed a lot 
 Then you were gone honey thanks a lot

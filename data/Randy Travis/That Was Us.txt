Twenty dollars out of momma's purse bough 
 Us a tank of gas 
 And some Redman tobacco 
 When we were just teenage kids 
 Me and my old buddy Leroy, 
 We'd go driving around 
 If there was trouble to be found, 
 Then man we dang sure did it 
 Cutting doughnuts in the fields 
 Till old man Smith would call the cops 
 He'd come runnin' down his crops 
 And I reckon he's still wonderin' who that was 
 But that was us 
 Now some of these old local boys moved on 
 But we never changed a bit 
 Never had a lick of sense, least that's what 
 Some folks said 
 Then we finally turned old enough to buy our 
 Own beer 
 Don't remember much about that year, 
 Just lucky we ain't dead 
 'Cause somebody said they saw some boys 
 With a truck looked just like mine 
 Tryin' to pull down that old water tank 
 That sits out on the country line 
 And people wonder why it leans the way it does 
 That was us 
 Seems like small towns never change 
 But things get tough when times get hard 
 And they said when he got sick 
 Old man Smith would've lost the farm 
 'Cause he was getting' way behind on all his bills 
 Till somebody brought his crops in from the fields 
 Yeah and folks 'round here still woneder who 
 That was 
 That was us

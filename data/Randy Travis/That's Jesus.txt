When I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor 
 I thank Him for the day that He gave me one more 
 I give Him all the praise, the one that I adore 
 That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus 
 I was lost and alone, my heart in need of help 
 I found enternal life and lost my fear of death 
 Because I know the author of my every breath 
 That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus 
 God of glory, majesty 
 The Holy One who died for me 
 Who's the One I long to see 
 That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus 
 If you're a soul that's lost and in need of direction 
 You wonder when you die if you'll go to Heaven 
 Well friend I found the answer to that very question 
 That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus. 
 God of glory, majesty 
 The Holy One who died for me 
 Who's the One I long to see 
 That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus 
 That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus.

I've been throwing horseshoes 
 Over my left shoulder 
 I've spent most all my life 
 Searching for that four leaf clover 
 When you run with me 
 Chasing my rainbows 
 And honey I love you too 
 That's the way love goes 
 That's the way love goes babe 
 That's the music God made 
 For all the world to sing 
 It never gets old it grows 
 Losing makes me sorry 
 Well now honey don't worry 
 Don't you know I love you too 
 That's the way love goes

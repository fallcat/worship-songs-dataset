Hope you didn't burn too many bridges 
 On your way back to haunt my heart 
 'Cause it's safe behind these stones and ridges 
 You know how us healin' victims are 
 I take comfort where I find it 
 In the neon and the crowds 
 I guess someone like me designed it 
 This place where old flames aren't allowed 
 There's a border you can't cross 
 There's a wall that you can't climb 
 The space is drawn too wide 
 Between your world and mine 
 You've already broke my heart 
 (And) I won't let you break my mind 
 As far as your memory goes 
 That's where I draw the line 
 I'll bet this isn't how you planned it 
 I've picked myself up off the ground 
 These legs are shakin', but they're standin' 
 And I won't let you knock me down 
 There's a border you can't cross 
 There's a wall that you can't climb 
 The space is drawn too wide 
 Between your world and mine 
 You've already broke my heart 
 (And) I won't let you break my mind 
 As far as your memory goes 
 That's where I draw the line 
 That's where I draw the line

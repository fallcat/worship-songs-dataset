The writing is on the wall, baby 
 We're different as day and night 
 But I guess that I refused to face it 
 The blues in black and white 
 When I got home I knew, baby 
 Something was wrong tonight 
 When I found the note you wrote, it gave 
 The blues in black and white 
 Color my world without you in it 
 And the future don't look too bright 
 Darlin' it's not a pretty picture 
 The blues in black and white 
 Since you've been gone I'm going crazy 
 I've got to get on with my life 
 Maybe I'll write a book and call it 
 The blues in black and white 
 Color my world without you in it 
 And the future don't look too bright 
 Darlin' it's not a pretty picture 
 The blues in black and white

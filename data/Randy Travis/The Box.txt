On the top shelf in the closet 
 In the workshop where he spent his extra time 
 Was a dusty wooden box that I had never noticed 'til that night 
 Then we set it on the table; carefully, we opened up the top 
 And stared into the memory 
 Daddy kept inside the box 
 There was a letter from Mamma, when she went out to Reno 
 To help her sister out in '62 
 And a flower from Hawaii, when they went on vacation 
 It was the first time that my daddy ever flew 
 And the pocket knife I gave to him on Fathers day 
 Years ago; I thought it had been lost 
 We all thought his heart was made of solid rock 
 That was long before we found the box 
 I guess we always knew it, but "I love you" was hard for him to say 
 Some men show it easy, and some just never seem to find the way 
 But that night I began to see a softer side of someone I had lost 
 I saw the love he kept inside the first time when we opened up the box 
 There was a picture that was taken, when he and Mom were datin' 
 Standing by his 1944 
 And a faded leather Bible he got when he was baptised 
 I guess no-one understood him like the Lord 
 And the poem that he had written all about his wife and children 
 The tender words he spoke were quite a shock 
 We all thought his heart was made of solid rock 
 But that was long before we found the box 
 We all thought his heart was made of solid rock 
 But that was long before we found the box

He was just a carpenter by trade 
 He learned from His Father at a very early age 
 There was something special in the man 
 There was much more to His life 
 Than just working with His hands 
 And He'd say "There's no home I could design 
 That would match the one you'll find 
 When you leave this world behind 
 If you'll only take the time." 
 To love your neighbour like your brother 
 Treat your brother like a friend 
 Always turn the other cheek 
 Help the weary and the weak 
 Make the time for young and old 
 And as your life unfolds 
 Each kindness that you've shown 
 Will be the nails and hammers 
 As you build your final ladder 
 In the manner of the carpenter of old 
 You could feel compassion in His eyes 
 But only fools that hurt Him did not realize 
 That He was speaking to us all 
 The righteous and the mighty 
 The silent and the small 
 And He'd say, "There's no home I could design 
 That would match the one you'll find 
 When you leave this world behind 
 If you'll only take the time." 
 To love your neighbour like your brother 
 Treat your brother like a friend 
 Always turn the other cheek 
 Help the weary and the weak 
 Make the time for young and old 
 And as your life unfolds 
 Each kindness that you've shown 
 Will be the nails and hammers 
 As you build your final ladder 
 In the manner of the carpenter of old 
 He was just a carpenter by trade 
 He learned from His father at a very early age

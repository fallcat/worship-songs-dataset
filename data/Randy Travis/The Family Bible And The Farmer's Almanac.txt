My father's father was the wisest man I ever knew 
 Sixty years of education 
 Seven years of school 
 Farming kept his body strong 
 At night the only books he owned 
 Kepted his mind sharp as a tack 
 The family bible and the farmer's almanac 
 When to plant 
 When to havest 
 How you weed just what you sow 
 When to look for rain and who to turn to when it don't 
 There was a plan for early frost 
 Salvation for the lost 
 Words to live and die by front to back 
 The family bible and the farmer's almanac 
 One came from his mother 
 Handed down the day she died 
 The co-op sent the other 
 Every year at christmastime 
 He knew the seasons to the day 
 Knew Paul and Peter by first name 
 He could answer any question he was asked 
 With the family bible and the farmer's almanac 
 When to plant 
 When to havest 
 How you weed just what you sow 
 When to look for rain and who to turn to when it don't 
 There was a plan for early frost 
 Salvation for the lost 
 Words to live and die by front to back 
 The family bible and the farmer's almanac 
 He knew the way to get 
 Through this life to the next 
 While others spoke of faith 
 He found the facts 
 In the family bible and the farmer's almanac 
 The family bible and the farmer's almanac

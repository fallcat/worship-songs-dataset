The first noel, the angels did say 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel! 
 They looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the East beyond them far 
 And to the earth it gave great light 
 And so it continued both day and night. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel! 
 The star drew nigh to the northwest 
 Over Bethlehem it took its rest 
 And there it did both stop and stay 
 Right over the place where Jesus lay. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel! 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
 Born is the King of Israel!

He was born in Bethlehem they say, 
 There was a star to light the path to where He lay. 
 Rich or poor they came from far and near, 
 'Cause they'd all heard the reason He was here. 
 He was the Son God sent to one and all. 
 Put on this earth to hang there on that cross. 
 Born to die so we could live. 
 He had the birthday, we got the gift. 
 They wrapped him up with gentle hands. 
 God hoped the world would understand. 
 Eternal life we shall receive. 
 And all that He asks in return is that we just believe. 
 He was the Son God sent to one and all. 
 Put on this earth to hang there on that cross. 
 Born to die so we could live. 
 He had the birthday, we got the gift. 
 No way in this world we could repay Him 
 The miracle He gave us on that day. 
 He was the Son God sent to one and all, 
 Put on this earth to hang there on that cross, 
 Born to die so we could live. 
 He had the birthday, we got the gift. 
 On our Savior's birthday, we got the gift...

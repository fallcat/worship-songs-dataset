A friend of mine bought himself a shovel 
 Said, I'm gonna tunnel me a mine 
 He set out to be a rich man 
 Happiness is what he thought he'd find 
 Got in too deep to see the diamonds 
 Down too dark to see the gold 
 Now he won't let go of the shovel 
 And he can't dig out of the hole 
 Deeper and deeper he's goin' down 
 Driving his future 
 Right into the ground 
 He thinks he's closer 
 The further he goes 
 But he's still on the bottom 
 And he can't dig out of the hole 
 I tried to throw the man a lifeline 
 I tried to send him down a rope 
 I don't think he hears me calling 
 But every day I pray and I hope 
 Somehow he finally gets the message 
 Every spade of dirt he throws 
 Only gets him close to the devil 
 And he can't dig out of the hole 
 Deeper and deeper he's goin' down 
 Driving his future 
 Right into the ground 
 He thinks he's closer 
 The further he goes 
 But he's still on the bottom 
 And he can't dig out of the hole 
 Maybe we could learn a little lesson 
 Maybe this'll shine a little light 
 There's no healthy way to mess with 
 The line between wrong and right 
 Use the one chance you've been given 
 'Cause once you're in the ground and cold 
 It's too late to start livin' 
 You see you can't dig out of the hole 
 Deeper and deeper he's goin' down 
 Driving his future 
 Right into the ground 
 He thinks he's closer 
 The further he goes 
 But he's still on the bottom 
 And he can't dig out of the hole 
 It's Hell on the bottom 
 And you can't dig out of the hole...

We've flown to the moon 
 But have we missed the boat along the way? 
 We reached for the stars 
 But are we that far removed from the cave? 
 We've got radios and codaphones, computers 
 We found satellites in space 
 Now everybody's talking 
 So tell me why we can't communicate 
 Are we losing the human race? 
 Do we ever really learn from our mistakes? 
 Who's ahead, who's behind? 
 Will there be a finish line? 
 Are we losing the human race? 
 Nations are starving 
 While we pay our farmers not to grow their grain 
 Fossil fuel is going up in smoke 
 And coming down in acid rain 
 The more that we progress it seems 
 The farther we keep slipping down that drain 
 It's a no-win situation 
 So tell me why we have to play the game 
 Are we losing the human race? 
 Do we ever really learn from our mistakes? 
 Who's ahead, who's behind? 
 Will there be a finish line? 
 Are we losing the human race? 
 Who's ahead, who's behind? 
 Will there be a finish line? 
 Are we losing the human race?

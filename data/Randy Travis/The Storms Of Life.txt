There's a dirty piece of cardboard 
 That reads Montgomery Ward 
 Taped across the window of my old Ford 
 A six-pack on the front seat and a box of chicken wings 
 I'm dialin' 'cross the radio for a song that I can sing 
 I'd better change my wandrin ways 
 I know I've seen my better days 
 Always gettin' high when I get low 
 Well, I left my soul out in the rain 
 Lord, what a price I've had to pay 
 The storms of life are washin' me away 
 An old mail pouch, tobacco sign 
 Fadin' on the barn 
 Bringin' back sweet memories of Mama's farm 
 When love was just a country girl that lived on down the road 
 spoken: 
 You know, she almost had me turned around, 
 But that was years ago 
 I'd better change my wandrin ways 
 I know I've seen my better days 
 Always gettin' high when I get low 
 Well, I left my soul out in the rain 
 Lord, what a price I've had to pay 
 The storms of life are washin' me away 
 Yeah, the storms of life are washin' me away

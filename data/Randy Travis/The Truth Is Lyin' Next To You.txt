Everybody said I'd leave you 
 They gave us six months to a year 
 Said our love would just fall pray to 
 The jukebox, women and the beer 
 They wanna get those rumours flyin' 
 They're watchin' for a rendez-vous 
 But if they ever say I'm cheatin' 
 They'll be lyin' 
 The truth is lyin' next to you 
 Thruth is 
 I'm gonna be here for a long long time 
 I'll stay forever or 'til you say goodbye 
 Don't need a neon moon to make my night shine 
 And if you need some lovin' proof 
 Just reach out 
 The truth is lyin' next to you 
 Over phone lines and back fences 
 We're the talk of this whole town 
 They just shake their heads in wonder 
 They can't believe I'm still around 
 They can search the backstreet barrooms 
 To see if I'm with someone new 
 But if they ever say they saw me 
 They'll be lyin' 
 The thruth is lyin' next to you 
 Thruth is 
 I'm gonna be here for a long long time 
 I'll stay forever or 'til you say goodbye 
 Don't need a neon moon to make my night shine 
 And if you need some lovin' proof 
 Thruth is 
 I'm gonna be here for a long long time 
 I'll stay forever or 'til you say goodbye 
 Don't need a neon moon to make my night shine 
 And if you need some lovin' proof

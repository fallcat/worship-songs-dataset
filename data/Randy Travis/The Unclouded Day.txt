Oh, they tell me of a home far beyond the skies 
 They tell me of a home far away 
 Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise 
 Oh, they tell me of an unclouded day. 
 Oh, the land of cloudless days 
 Oh, the land of an uncloudy sky 
 Oh, they tell me of a land where no storm clouds rise 
 Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day. 
 Oh, they tell me of a King in His beauty there 
 And they tell me that mine eyes shall behold 
 Where He sits on a throne that is whiter than snow 
 In the city that is made of gold. 
 Oh, the land of cloudless days 
 Oh, the land of an uncloudy sky 
 Oh, they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise 
 Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day. 
 Oh, the land of cloudless days 
 Oh, the land of an uncloudy sky 
 Oh, they tell me of a land where no storm clouds rise 
 Oh, they tell me of an uncloudy day...

I love you, there's nothing to hide, 
 It's better than burning inside, 
 I love you, no use to pretend, 
 There! I've said it again. 
 I've said it, what more can I say, 
 Believe me, there's no other way, 
 I love you, I will to the end, 
 There! I've said it again. 
 I try to drum up, 
 A phrase that will sum up, 
 All that I feel for you. 
 But what good are phrases, 
 The thought that amazes, 
 Is that you love me, 
 And it's heavenly. 
 Forgive me for wanting you so, 
 But one thing I want you to know, 
 I've loved you since heaven knows when, 
 There! I've said it again.

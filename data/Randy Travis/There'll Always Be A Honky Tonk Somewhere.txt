There may no be a Superbowl in 2083 
 Cars and trains and video games will all be history 
 The world just keeps on changing, things come and then they go 
 Nothing lasts forever except one thing I know 
 There'll always be a honky tonk 
 With a jukebox in the corner 
 And someone crying in their beer 
 And one old hanger-oner 
 And a lady looking lonely 
 From a losing love affair 
 Yeah there'll always be a honky tonk somewhere 
 Yeah there'll always be a honky tonk somewhere 
 There may be factories on the moon and farming out in space 
 It seems there's nothing here on earth 
 That something won't replace 
 But as long as there's a broken heart there'll be a place to go 
 Where good ole boys meet good ole girls 
 And the wine and music flow

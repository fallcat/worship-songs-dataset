The sign said Synonara in the Japanese restaurant 
 The billboard said "There's No Tomorrow" in the Christ Church parking lot 
 The laundry mat said, "You're All Washed Up" 
 How can I disagree? 
 And the street sign 
 Did everyone know but me? 
 She must have gone 
 To a lot of trouble 
 I got the truth 
 Right betweent he eyes 
 Don't know how she found the time 
 But between her door and mine 
 Was a thirteen mile goodbye 
 Now this can't be paranoia 
 It's just coincidence 
 At the Palace Theatre on the corner's playing 
 "Gone With The Wind" 
 And there's one more grim reminder 
 Every twenty feet 
 How come I never noticed 
 This is a dead end street? 
 She must have gone 
 To a lot of trouble 
 I got the truth 
 Right betweent he eyes 
 Don't know how she found the time 
 But between her door and mine 
 Was a thirteen mile goodbye 
 I see the Y in the YMCA 
 I've been asking myself that all day 
 She put a closed sign on every door 
 Just to proved the point if I wasn't sure 
 She must have gone 
 To a lot of trouble 
 I got the truth 
 Right betweent he eyes 
 Don't know how she found the time 
 But between her door and mine 
 Was a thirteen mile goodbye

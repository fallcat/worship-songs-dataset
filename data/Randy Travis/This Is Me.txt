Lately I get the feelin', there's a feelin' that your holdin' in 
 Why do you keep your distance, as close as we've been 
 Do you think your silence is sayin', there ain't nothin' wrong with you 
 This is me, you're not talkin' to 
 This is me 
 The one who knows you inside out 
 The one you've leaned on till now 
 Don't you know I'm still here for you 
 So what do you think your doin' 
 Who do you think your foolin' 
 This is me 
 You're not talkin' to 
 You can run to me, no matter what your runnin' from 
 If it's somethin' I'm doin', I'll get it undone 
 Just don't let me be a stranger, to what you're goin' through 
 Hey this is me, you're not talkin' to 
 This is me 
 The one who knows you inside out 
 The one you've leaned on till now 
 Don't you know I'm still here for you 
 So what do you think your doin' 
 Who do you think your foolin' 
 This is me 
 You're not talkin' to 
 Hey this is me 
 You're not talking to

So many times I've questioned certain circumstances 
 Or things I could not understand 
 Many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision 
 And my frustration gets so out of hand 
 It's then I am reminded I've never been forsaken 
 I've never had to stand the test alone 
 As I look at all the victories, the Spirit rises up in me 
 It's through the fire my weakness is made strong 
 And He never promised that the cross would not get heavy 
 Or the hill would not be hard to climb 
 He never offered victory without fighting 
 But He said help would always come in time 
 Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision 
 And the adversary says give in 
 Just hold on, our Lord will show up 
 And He will take you through the fire again 
 I know within myself that I would surely perish 
 But if I trust the hand of God 
 He'll shield the flames again 
 And He never promised that the cross would not get heavy 
 Or the hill would not be hard to climb 
 He never offered victory without fighting 
 But He said help would always come in time 
 Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision 
 And the adversary says give in 
 Just hold on, our Lord will show up 
 And He will take you through the fire again 
 Just hold on, our Lord will show up 
 And He will take you through the fire again

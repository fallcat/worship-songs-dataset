I'm gonna need a strong one, it's gonna be a long one 
 In case you haven't heard he stopped loving her today 
 So I'm dusting off the vinyl, it's gonna be an all-nighter 
 I'm warning you now, from here on out, boys, I'll be the DJ 
 So find a drink or find a road, I'm 'bout to drop a needle on some ol' no show 
 You're gonna want an ashtray and a bottle 
 I'm going deep, I'm going long 'til I run that needle through every last song 
 He ever sung, so pour 'em strong and smoke 'em if you got 'em 
 Tonight I'm playing Possum 
 I'll bet he'd step right up singing, right now he's bringing 
 Every angel in that house up there to tears 
 So close the doors and lock 'em up, and if you see me choking up 
 Just dim the light cause, boys, tonight what happens here stays here 
 So find a drink or find a road, I'm 'bout to drop a needle on some ol' no show 
 You're gonna want an ashtray and a bottle 
 I'm going deep, I'm going long 'til I run that needle through every last song 
 He ever sung, so pour 'em strong and smoke 'em if you got 'em 
 Boys, tonight I'm playing Possum 
 Bartender's Blues and Why Baby Why 
 Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes, Still Doing Time 
 I'm going deep, I'm going long 'til I run that needle through every last song 
 He ever sung, so pour 'em strong and smoke 'em if you got 'em 
 Tonight I'm playing Possum 
 Tonight I'm playing Possum 
 I'm gonna need a strong one, it's gonna be a long one 
 In case you haven't heard, he stopped loving her today

Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
 We're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball 
 The good times ain't over after all 
 Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
 Well it seems we let the hard times come between us 
 Like a wall around our hearts we couldn't see 
 Hard luck and troubles came rainin' down upon us 
 And they almost got the best of you and me 
 Once we loved to stay at home and make love 
 Now work is all we ever seem to do 
 We've been spendin' too much time makin' money 
 And I think it's time we had a laugh or two 
 And tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
 We're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball 
 The good times ain't over after all 
 Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
 Well you put on your party clothes and make up 
 And I'll polish that ol' truck until it shines 
 Don't worry 'bout a thing 'til Monday mornin' 
 Just leave hard luck and trouble far behind 
 And tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
 We're gonna laugh and drink and dance and have a ball 
 The good times ain't over after all 
 Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls 
 The good times ain't over after all 
 Tonight we're gonna tear down the walls

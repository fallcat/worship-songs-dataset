You've been too gone for too long 
 It's too late to come back now 
 It's been so long since you walked out my door 
 Now you're just an old song nobody sings any more 
 I've got a new love and she's a true love 
 But darlin' how could you have known 
 You've been too gone for too long 
 Now it's too late to come back home 
 You came a long way goin' the wrong way 
 Don't even set your suitcase down 
 You wanted to roam now you're paying the bill 
 You're an old rolling stone who rolled over the hill 
 I had a good cry when you said goodbye 
 I didn't want to let you go 
 But you've been too hgone for too long 
 Now it's too late to come back home 
 I had a good cry when you said goodbye 
 I didn't want to let you go 
 But you've been gone for too long 
 So why don't you just stay gone 
 Now you've been too gone for too long 
 Now it's too late to come back home

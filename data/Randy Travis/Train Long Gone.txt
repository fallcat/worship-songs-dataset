(Gone!) Well, I hate how that word 
 Rattles all around in this room 
 (Alone,) with a memory so strong 
 I could sweep it up with a broom. 
 (Tears,) if I shed anymore I'm afraid 
 They might wear out my face 
 (Clear,) Yes, It's clear to me now 
 That her love can never be replaced. 
 Love may be gone but never forgotten 
 The memory won't leave you alone 
 And the train may be long gone from the station 
 But you still hear the whistle moan. 
 Still hear the whistle moan. 
 (Time,) time got so slow and thick 
 That the clock hardly ticks anymore 
 (Crime,) it's a crime how I sit here 
 And stare like a dog at the door. 
 (Blame,) Aw yes, I'll take the blame 
 I admit I did not treat her right 
 (Shame,) It's a shame laying here 
 All alone on this cold, windy night. 
 Love may be gone but never forgotten 
 The memory won't leave you alone 
 And the train may be long gone from the station 
 But you still hear the whistle moan. 
 Still hear the whistle moan. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train gone, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train gone, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train gone, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. 
 Love may be gone but never forgotten 
 The memory won't leave you alone 
 And the train may be long gone from the station 
 But you can still hear the whistle moan. 
 Still hear the whistle moan. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train gone, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train gone, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train, long gone train. 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
 Train, long gone train...

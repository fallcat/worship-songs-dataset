Trouble in mind I'm blue 
 But I won't be blue always 
 Cause the sun's gonna shine 
 In my backdoor someday 
 I'm gonna lay my head 
 On a lonesome railroad line 
 And let that two-nineteen 
 Pacify my mind 
 I'm all alone at midnight 
 And my lamp is burning low 
 Never had so much trouble 
 In my life before 
 Trouble in mind I'm blue 
 But I won't be blue always 
 Cause the sun's gonna shine 
 In my backdoor someday

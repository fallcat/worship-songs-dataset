I can't believe I'm standing out here in the yard 
 Starin' at those treadmarks you left with your car 
 Before you get too far out of town 
 I hope you turn it around 
 I didn't think you had it in you 
 Who'd have thought you'd really leave 
 It's kind of like some movie I wish I'd never seen 
 You left and left my world upside down 
 You've got to turn it around 
 It's safe to say I've underestimated how strong you are 
 Apparently girl you've got what it takes to break my heart 
 You've everything I need I know 
 Right now I want to hold you close 
 And all I can do is pray that you'll come home 
 It's probably a safe bet that you ain't comin' back 
 I made some big mistakes I'll admit to that 
 If there's still a chance that we can work this out 
 My life's got to change starting now 
 I'm going to turn it around 
 I can't believe I'm standin' out here in the yard 
 Starin' at those treadmarks you left with your car 
 Before you get too far out of town 
 My life's going to change starting now 
 I need to turn it around 
 Baby turn it around

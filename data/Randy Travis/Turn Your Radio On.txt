Come and listen in to a radio station 
 Where the mighty hosts of heaven sing 
 Turn your radio on, turn your radio on 
 If you want to feel those good vibrations 
 Coming from the joy that His love can bring 
 Turn you radio on, turn your radio on 
 Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air 
 Turn your radio on and glory share 
 Turn your lights down low and listen to the Master's radio 
 Get in touch with God, and turn your radio on 
 Everybody has a radio receiver 
 All you got to do is listen for the call 
 Turn your radio on, turn your radio on 
 If you listen in you will be a believer 
 Leanin' on the truths that'll never fall 
 Get in touch with God, turn your radio on 
 Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air 
 Turn your radio on and glory share 
 Turn your lights down low and listen to the Master's radio 
 Get in touch with God, turn your radio on 
 Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air 
 Turn your radio on and glory share 
 Turn your lights down low and listen to the Master's radio 
 Get in touch with God, turn your radio on 
 Turn your lights down low and listen to the Master's radio 
 Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

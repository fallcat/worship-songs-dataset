Up above my head I hear music in the air 
 Up above my head I hear music in the air 
 Up above my head I hear music in the air 
 And I really do believe, I say I really do believe 
 There is a heaven somewhere 
 Up above my head I see trouble in the air 
 Up above my head I see trouble in the air 
 Up above my head I see trouble in the air 
 And I really do believe, I say I really do believe 
 There is a heaven somewhere 
 Heaven somewhere 
 Up above my head I hear music in the air 
 Up above my head I hear music in the air 
 Up above my head I hear music in the air 
 And I really do believe, I say I really do believe 
 There is a heaven somewhere 
 Heaven somewhere 
 Up above my head I see trouble in the air 
 Up above my head I see trouble in the air 
 Up above my head I see trouble in the air 
 And I really do believe, I say I really do believe 
 There is a heaven somewhere 
 Heaven somewhere 
 And I really do believe, I say I really do believe 
 There is a heaven somewhere 
 Heaven somewhere

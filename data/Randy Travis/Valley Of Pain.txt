Don't let me grow bitter I pray 
 Give me strength to carry on my way 
 I'm leanin' on you like a wooden cane 
 While I'm walkin' through I'm walkin' through 
 The valley of pain 
 I'm believin' there's a reason for this trial 
 This too shall pass in a little while 
 Oh Lord have mercy if I complain 
 While I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through 
 A valley of pain 
 While I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through 
 A valley of pain 
 Won't you bathe me in a river of my tears 
 Whisper hope and truth and courage in my ears 
 When I'm hurting I have a dangerous tongue 
 I'll lose it and use it like a gun 
 Lord stop me if you see me takin' aim 
 While I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through 
 A valley of pain 
 I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through 
 A valley of pain 
 I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through 
 A valley of pain 
 Bathe me in a river of my tears 
 Whisper hope and truth and courage in my ears 
 Remind me when I reach the other side 
 I'll be thankful for every tear that I cried 
 Don't let me grow bitter I pray 
 Give me strength to carry on my way 
 Don't let the darkness drive me insane 
 While I'm walkin' through, walkin' through 
 A valley of pain 
 I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through 
 A valley of pain 
 I'm walkin' through, I'm walkin' through 
 This valley of pain

This old road has taken it's toll 
 I've been broke down 
 But now I'm back on the road 
 Got it in the gear, sittin' on the go 
 Just waitin' on the light to change 
 I'm goin' places straight to the top 
 I'm all revved up and my engines hot 
 Just temporarily come to a stop 
 And I'm waitin' on the light to change 
 I took a little detour 
 Wrong way down a one way street 
 I had to learn the hard way 
 No shortcuts to easy street 
 I lose my way now and then 
 But better days are just around the bend 
 I'm gonna get myself movin' again 
 I'm just waitin' on the light to change 
 I took a little detour 
 Wrong way down a one way street 
 I had to learn the hard way 
 No shortcuts to easy street 
 No, no, no 
 Both my hands are on the wheel 
 My turn will come, I know it will 
 From now on it's all downhill 
 I'm just waitin' on the light to change 
 I'm just waitin' on the light to change 
 Things are moving up ahead for me now 
 And I'm ready to roll, I'm waitin' 
 I'm waitin' on the light to change

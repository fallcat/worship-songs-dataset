There's do'ers and don'ters and I wills and won'ters 
 And them, that don't even try 
 Givers and takers, movers and shakers 
 And them that are just passing by 
 Skidrows and winos and some folks that I know 
 That don't do like I think they should 
 I thought they were livin' their lifes all wrong 
 Long, before I understood 
 We all have to walk our own road 
 We can't always go where we're told 
 In the end where it'll end up - the Lord only knows 
 But we all have to walk our own road 
 I've had some good times and I've had a good life 
 And I've had things goin' my way 
 I've walked the highground and treasures that I've found 
 An' women who brightened my day 
 Then there were times I was caught in the crosswinds 
 With life - goin' 'round and around 
 Like a ship with no sails, I was caught in a gale 
 Till I fin'ly just ran it a-ground 
 We all have to walk our own road 
 We can't always go where we're told 
 In the end where it'll end up - the Lord only knows 
 But we all have to walk our own road 
 We all have to walk our own road 
 We can't always go where we're told 
 In the end where it'll end up - the Lord only knows 
 But we all have to walk our own road

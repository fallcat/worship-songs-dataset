Walk with me through darkness 
 Every day and every night 
 Walk with me through the darkness 
 Walk with me until I reach the light 
 We all stumble on life's journeys 
 We all need a helping hand 
 From time to time we all wonder 
 How we fit into Your plan 
 Walk with me through the darkness 
 Hold my hand when I am lost 
 Carry me when the road gets rough 
 Pick me up each time I fall 
 Let Your presence be here with me 
 Every day and every night 
 Walk with me through the darkness 
 Walk with me until I reach the light 
 When I am in my darkest hour 
 And I feel like givin' up 
 Take this weight from off my shoulder 
 Fill my heart with Your love 
 Walk with me through the darkness 
 Hold my hand when I am lost 
 Carry me when the road gets rough 
 Pick me up each time I fall 
 Let your presence be here with me 
 Every day and every night 
 Walk with me through the darkness 
 Walk with me until I reach the light 
 Walk with me through the darkness 
 Walk with me until I reach the light

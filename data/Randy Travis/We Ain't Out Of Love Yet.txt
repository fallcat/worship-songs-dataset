You can throw away my picture, empty out my dresser drawer 
 Break up all the dishes, change the lock on the door 
 But you can't erase my memory, no matter how you try 
 It don't mean it's over, just because you said goodbye 
 I'm sorry that I hurt you, but you made me so mad 
 If I don't care about you, why do I feel so bad 
 We're almost out of sugar, and our matches got wet 
 But we ain't out of love yet 
 We ain't out of love yet lets not do something hasty, baby, that we'll regret 
 Our lovin' cup ain't empty, there's still plenty left 
 We ain't out of love yet 
 We might run out of gas and be left out in the rain 
 Could run out of ciggarettes or money again 
 A little out of touch or just plain out of our heads 
 But we ain't out of love yet 
 We ain't out of love yet 
 Lets not do something hasty, baby, that we'll regret 
 Our lovin' cup ain't empty there's still plenty left 
 We ain't out of love yet 
 And with just a little mending we can have a happy ending 
 Lets forgive and forget 
 We don't need a lawyer now we just need a rest 
 Then we can ge back into doin' what we do best 
 Was scarlett ever through with rhett 
 You can't break up a perfect set 
 And we ain't out of love yet

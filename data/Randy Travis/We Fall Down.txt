We fall down 
 We lay our crowns 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 The greatness of 
 The mercy and love 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy" 
 We cry, "Holy, holy, holy" 
 We cry, "Holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lamb" 
 We fall down 
 We lay our crown 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 The greatness of 
 The mercy and love 
 At the feet of Jesus 
 And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy" 
 And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy" 
 And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lamb" 
 And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy" 
 We cry, "Holy, holy, holy" 
 We cry, "Holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lamb"

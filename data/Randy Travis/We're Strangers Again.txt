First we were strangers down on our luck 
 And both in need of a friend 
 We promised each other 
 To much to live up to 
 And now we're strangers again 
 (Tammy) 
 I came like a stranger 
 And you took me in 
 And I felt at home in your arms 
 We had nothing but good times 
 As long as the sun shines 
 But we just couldn't weather the storms 
 (Randy) 
 You came like a stranger 
 And I took you in 
 And you gave me some reasons 
 To live 
 I gave the good times 
 And you gave the sunshine 
 Till we ran out of good things to give 
 Now we are strangers back down on our luck 
 And both in need of a friend 
 We promised each other 
 To much to live up to 
 And now we're strangers again 
 Strangers again...

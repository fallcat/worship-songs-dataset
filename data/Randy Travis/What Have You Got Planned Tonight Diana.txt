It all started in 1929 me and Diana had gone to Alaska 
 To homestead some of that free government land 
 Forty miles from the nearest gravel road 
 We cut our life in the ponderosa pines 
 We sweated hard to beat the winter snow 
 But the cabin's up and we've got lots of times 
 What have you got planned tonight Diana 
 Would you consider laying in my arms 
 I love you more than ever now Diana 
 I'm sure you're the reason I was born 
 Jim was born the first year we were here 
 Look at him Diana he's almost grown 
 And the baby's in the cradle fast asleep 
 Just think in no time they'll be up and gone 
 What have you got planned tonight Diana 
 Would you consider laying in my arms 
 I love you more than ever now Diana 
 I'm sure you're the reason I was born 
 Well time sure does fly by doesn't it Diana 
 It's been almost two years now since you've been gone 
 Speaking of time 
 I guess mine's about up 
 Just another breath or two 
 And I'll be home 
 And by the way 
 What have you got planned tonight Diana 
 Would you consider laying in my arms 
 I love you more than ever now Diana 
 I'm sure you're the reason I was born

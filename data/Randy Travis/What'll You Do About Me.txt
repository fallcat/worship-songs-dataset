All you wanted was a one night stand 
 The fire, the wine and the touch of a man 
 But I fell in love and ruined all your plans 
 Now what'll you do about me 
 Imagine the faces on your high class friends 
 When I beat on the door and I beg to come in 
 Screamin' "Come on love me again" 
 Now what'll you do about me 
 Well you can change your number 
 You can change your name 
 You can ride like hell on the midnight train 
 That's alright Mama that's okay 
 But what'll you do about me 
 Picture your neighbors when you try to explain 
 That good ol' boy standin' out in the rain 
 With his nose on a window pane 
 Now what'll you do about me 
 What in the world are you planning to do 
 When a man comes over just to visit with you 
 And I'm on the porch with a two-by-two 
 Lady what'll you do about me 
 Well you can call your lawyer 
 You can call the fuzz 
 You can sound the alarm wake the neighbors up 
 Ain't no way to stop a man in love 
 Now what'll you do about me 
 All you wanted was a one-night stand 
 The fire, the wine and the touch of a man 
 But I fell in love and baby here I am 
 Now what'll you do about me 
 Well you can change your number 
 You can change your name 
 You can ride like hell on a midnight train 
 That's alright Mama that's okay 
 Now what'll you do about me 
 Now what'll you do about me 
 Yeah, what'll you do about me

For you I am praying 
 For you I am praying 
 For you I am oraying 
 I'm praying for you 
 Daddy never went to church on Sunday 
 He said that's one thing I'll never do 
 Mama never gave up she said one day 
 He'll be sitting here beside me and you 
 I can still hear Mama softly talking 
 Her tears falling on her folded hands 
 So that Easter Sunday Daddy walked 
 That's when I began to understand 
 When Mama prayed, good things happened 
 When Mama prayed, lives were changed 
 Not much more than five foot tall 
 But mountains big and small 
 Crumbled all the way when Mama prayed 
 Seventeen and wild I hit the bottom 
 Doing and thing I dang well please 
 Burning down life's highway at full throttle 
 While Mama burned a candle on her knees 
 Then one night I came home half sober 
 I saw Mama kneeling in the den 
 As I listened, she and Jesus talked it over 
 And I knew my restless days were 'bout to end 
 When Mama prayed, good things happened 
 When Mama prayed, lives were changed 
 Not much more than five foot tall 
 But mountains big and small 
 Crumbled all the way when Mama prayed 
 It isn't like every one of them got answered 
 But the times they weren't seems to me were rare 
 You almost felt sorry for the devil 
 Cause heaven knows he didn't have prayer 
 When Mama prayed, good things happened 
 When Mama prayed, lives were changed 
 Not much more than five foot tall 
 But mountains big and small 
 Crumbled all the way when Mama prayed

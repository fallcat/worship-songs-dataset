When we found our mountain we named it forever 
 And we lived on each other's dreams 
 You helped me build bridges to cross raging rivers 
 When your world was turning for me 
 I know that it's over, I know that you're leaving 
 I know that you crave to be free 
 But I can't help wishing that time could turn backwards 
 When your world was turning for me 
 What happened to always and forever I'll love you 
 And the future that was so plain to see 
 The dream seemed so endless and love had no boundaries 
 When your world was turning for me

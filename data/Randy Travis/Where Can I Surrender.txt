Ever want to run away, ever want to leave 
 Never one to hang around, never one to grieve 
 If love turned into labor, I would just resign 
 Workin' through the hard times never crossed my mind 
 And I'm guilty of entering and breaking hearts, so dear 
 Guilty of unlawful flight and failing to appear 
 I've committed all the crimes of love, every felony 
 Now, I have but one defense, to plead insanity 
 Where can I surrender, I'm tired of being free 
 I want love to come and make a prisoner out of me 
 I'm a big offender, oh, love come capture me 
 Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key 
 Events have come full circle now, 
 I spend my nights alone 
 Where love was once so full and free, 
 Love has up and gone 
 If the Good Lord should see fit 
 To bring sweet love my way again 
 I'll die before I run away and be the fool I've been 
 Oh, where can I surrender, I'm tired of being free 
 I want love to come and make a prisoner out of me 
 I'm a big offender, oh, love come capture me 
 Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key 
 Lock me in your velvet cell and throw away the key...

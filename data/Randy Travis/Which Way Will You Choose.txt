As the world becomes entwined 
 In the lies from Satan's mind 
 A leader will arise to take the reins 
 Saying love will bring us peace 
 If you put your hope in me 
 Renounce the name of Jesus or be slain 
 Which way will you choose 
 Which way will you choose 
 You got everything to gain 
 You got everything to lose 
 As the masses take his mark 
 Believe the lie to chill their hearts 
 They'll know the time has come to seal their fate 
 Those who cling to the cross 
 Will refuse and pay the cost 
 As God redeems his own from the sea of hate 
 Which way will you choose 
 Which way will you choose 
 You got everything to gain 
 You got everything to lose 
 As the age draws to an end 
 Hope will tumble down again 
 The Lord will make them feel their sin and shame 
 You can make the choice right now 
 Trust in Christ our hope and crown 
 Or watch the world you love go up in flames 
 Which way will you choose 
 Which way will you choose 
 You got everything to gain 
 You got everything to lose 
 Which way will you choose 
 Which way will you choose 
 You got everything to gain 
 You got everything to lose

I heard a freight train out across the way 
 I heard a woman sing Amazing Grace 
 I heard a night bird call to its mate 
 When I heard you whisper my name 
 I heard freedom break its chain 
 I heard a heart beat where once no sound remained 
 I heard angels rise and praise 
 When I heard you whisper my name 
 I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears 
 I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years 
 And I heard hatred fall from grace 
 When I heard you whisper my name 
 Beating softly against the waves 
 Fell a sound of an early morning rain 
 And though the lightning and thunder came 
 I still heard you whisper my name 
 I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears 
 I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years 
 And I heard hatred fall from grace 
 When I heard you whisper my name 
 And I heard angels rise and praise 
 When I heard you whisper my name

Tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why 
 You make me cry, baby, cry, baby, cry, baby, cry 
 I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die 
 So tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why 
 Well, I got a crow I wanna pick with you 
 Just like last time when the feathers flew 
 You're runnin' wild, kickin' up your heels 
 A-leavin' me home with a hand full of bills 
 Well, I can't live without you and you know it's true 
 But there's no livin' with you, so what'll I do? 
 I'm goin' honky tonkin', get as tight as I can 
 And maybe by then you'll 'preciate a good man 
 Tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why 
 You make me cry, baby, cry, baby, cry, baby, cry 
 I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die 
 So tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why 
 Well, now I don't know, but I've heard say 
 That ever' little dog is a-gonna have his day 
 You'd better pay attention, don't you dare forget 
 'Cause I'm just a little bitty puppy. yet 
 Yeah, I caught you honky tonkin' with my best friend 
 The thing to do was leave you, but I should'a left then 
 Now, I'm too old to leave you, but I still get sore 
 When you come home a feelin' for the knob on the door 
 Tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why 
 You make me cry, baby, cry, baby, cry, baby, cry 
 I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die 
 So tell me why, baby, why, baby, why, baby, why

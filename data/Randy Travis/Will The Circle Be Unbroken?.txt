I was standing by my window 
 On a cold and cloudy day 
 When I saw the hearse come rolling 
 For to carry my mother away. 
 Will the circle be unbroken 
 By and by Lord, by and by 
 There's a better home awaiting 
 In the sky Lord, in the sky. 
 Well, I went back home, home was lonely 
 For my mother she was gone 
 And all my family there was cryin' 
 For out home felt sad and alone. 
 Will the circle be unbroken 
 By and by Lord, by and by 
 There's a better home awaiting 
 In the sky Lord, in the sky. 
 Undertaker, undertaker, undertaker 
 Won't you please drive slow 
 For that lady you are haulin' 
 Lord, I hate to see her go. 
 Will the circle be unbroken 
 By and by Lord, by and by 
 There's a better home awaiting 
 In the sky Lord, in the sky. 
 There's a better home awaiting 
 In the sky Lord, in the sky

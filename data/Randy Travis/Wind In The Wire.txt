I've been riding fence all day, 
 Way up on the summer range. 
 Found a place to make my bed 
 As the evening shadows spread 
 Beyond the campfire light, 
 In the stillness of night, 
 Came the call of a coyote choir, 
 And the song 
 Of the wind in the wire. 
 As it strummed the rusted strings, 
 It sang of long-forgotten things. 
 Many moons and many suns 
 Of the real Americans. 
 When the arrow and the bow 
 Stalked the range 
 Of the buffalo, 
 And the call of the coyote choir 
 Knew no song 
 Of the wind in the wire. 
 As the ghostly balladeer 
 Hypnotized me, I could hear 
 Bugle calls, and battle cries. 
 Broken promises and lies. 
 The spirits of the plain 
 Still sing their sad refrain 
 In the call of the coyote choir 
 And the song 
 Of the wind in the wire.

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin', 
 In the lane, snow is glistenin' 
 A beautiful sight, 
 We're happy tonight, 
 Walking in a winter wonderland. 
 Gone away is the bluebird, 
 Here to stay is a new bird 
 He sings a love song, 
 As we go along, 
 Walkin' in a winter wonderland. 
 In the meadow we can build a snowman, 
 Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
 He'll say: Are you married? 
 We'll say: No man, 
 But you can do the job 
 While you're in town. 
 Later on, we'll conspire, 
 As we dream by the fire 
 To face unafraid, 
 The plans that we've made, 
 Walkin' in a winter wonderland.

Would I, would I' would I 
 Would I go out honky tonkin' with you every night 
 Dance every dance till I got them all right 
 Would I do every step the way you thought I should 
 If I had you Baby maybe yes I would 
 Would i 
 Would I wake up every morning bring you breakfast in bed 
 With the right amount of butter on your toasted bread 
 Would I fix you brunch, lunch and dinner just as good 
 If I had you Baby maybe yes I would 
 Well if I had you there'd be nothing you could do or say 
 To ever make me make you go away 
 Would I, would I, would I 
 Would I cut my hair and change the way I dress 
 Finally get around to cleaning up this mess 
 Would I happily give up my bachelorhood 
 If I had you Baby maybe yes I would 
 Would I 
 Would I tear everybody from my little black book 
 Tell them all I was over the urge to look 
 Would I marry you then just to be sure they understood 
 If I had you Baby maybe yes I would 
 Well if I had you there'd be nothing you could do or say 
 To ever make me make you go away 
 Would I, would I, would I 
 If I had you Baby maybe yes, yes I would

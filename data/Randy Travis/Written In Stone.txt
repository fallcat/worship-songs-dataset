I'm gonna take you down to the riverside 
 Where the water runs slow and wide 
 There's a big ole rock out in the middle 
 And I took my hammer and chisel 
 And worked all night so you could see 
 Just how much you mean to me 
 I carved your name right next to mine 
 And it'll be there 'til the end of time 
 And my love will last at least that long 
 It's written in stone how I feel for you 
 It's written in stone what I want to do 
 Spend my life and life hereafter lovin' you 
 And darlin' if we live to be a hundred 
 Or if we don't make it half that long 
 I want you to know what I feel for you 
 Is written in stone 
 There's a place on the edge of town 
 When I was a kid I found 
 Two names on a stone together 
 Lying side by side forever 
 And it was then and there I knew 
 If I ever thought a love was true 
 I'd surely want to write it down 
 On somethin' that would be around 
 When all the spoken words have come and gone 
 It's written in stone how I feel for you 
 It's written in stone what I want to do 
 Spend my life and life hereafter lovin' you 
 And darling if we live to be a hundred 
 Or if we don't make it half that long 
 I want you to know what I feel for you 
 Is written in stone 
 And when this life has come and gone 
 Our love will still be 
 Written in stone how I feel for you 
 Written in stone what I want to do 
 Spend my life and life hereafter lovin' you 
 And darling if we live to be a hundred 
 Or if we don't make it half that long 
 I want you to know what I feel for you 
 Is written in stone 
 I want you to know what I feel for you 
 Is written in stone 
 Is written in stone 
 Is written in stone...

If you can't buy groceries 
 'Cause you put your check down on a big screen 
 You ain't right 
 And you're in your thirties without a job 
 And your still living with you're mom 
 You ain't right 
 You go to your great uncle's wake 
 And you leave there with a hot date, 
 Find a deer on the side of the road check his pulse 
 And then you take him home 
 If you gotta leave early from the bar 
 'Cause your kids are waiting out in the car 
 You ain't right 
 You ain't right 
 Say the least your different 
 A couple quarts shy, and a few screws missing 
 Bless your heart look around 
 We're all an ounce or two short of a pound 
 Lord knows you're not alone 
 We're all a little wrong 
 But you ain't right 
 If your truck costs more than your house 
 Your girlfriend don't know about your spouse 
 You ain't right 
 If your past old enough to drive 
 And strugglin' through junior high 
 You ain't right 
 Hey if your wife's home mowin' the lawn 
 While you're fishin' all weekend long 
 Or you show up late for church smelling like beer 
 In a white pewter shirt 
 And when the collection plate comes by 
 You put in a ten take back a five 
 You ain't right 
 Son, you ain't right 
 Say the least your different 
 A couple quarts shy, and a few screws missing 
 Bless your heart look around 
 We're all an ounce or two short of a pound 
 Lord knows you're not alone 
 We're all a little wrong 
 But you ain't right 
 Hey, you ain't right 
 Say the least your different 
 A couple quarts shy, and a few screws missing 
 Bless your heart look around 
 We're all an ounce or two short of a pound 
 Lord knows you're not alone 
 We're all a little wrong 
 But you ain't right 
 Son your lights may be on 
 But you're not always at home 
 And we're all a little wrong 
 But you ain't right

When this old world gets me down and life's a chain I drag around, 
 When I can't find a ray of hope to help me sooth my worried soul, only you and you alone. 
 Can turn the darkest night into dawn, the only reason for hanging on, is you and you alone. 
 Holding you close to me, gives me all the strength I need, 
 Then I wake up it's just a dream, all that's left are memories, of only you and you alone, 
 To turn the darkest night into dawn, the only reason for hanging on, is you and you alone, 
 My only reason for hanging on, is your and your alone

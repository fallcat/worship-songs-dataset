I will worship with all of my heart 
 And I will praise you with all of my strength 
 And I will seek you all of my days 
 And I will follow, follow all of your ways 
 I will give you all my worship 
 I will give you all my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise 
 I will bow down and hail you as King 
 And I will serve you, I'll give you everything 
 And I will lift up my eyes to your throne 
 And I will trust you, I will trust you alone 
 I will give you all my worship 
 I will give you all my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise 
 I will bow down and hail you as King 
 And I will serve you, I'll give you everything 
 And I will lift up my eyes to your throne 
 And I will trust you, I will trust you alone 
 I will give you all my worship 
 I will give you all my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise 
 I will give you all my worship 
 I will give you all my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise

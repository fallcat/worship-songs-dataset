Long ago and far away 
 In my ol' common labor shoes 
 I turned the world all which a way 
 Just because you asked me to 
 Like unto no other 
 Feel simple love is simple true 
 There's no end to what I'd do 
 Just because you asked me 
 Let the world call me a fool 
 But if things are right with me and you 
 That's all that matters 
 And I'll do anything you asked me to 
 Knowing how much I love you 
 And after all that I've been through 
 I'd turn and walk away from you 
 Just because you asked me to 
 (Lord, I hope you'll never do) 
 Let the world call me a fool 
 But if things are right with me and you 
 That's all that matters 
 And I'll do anything you asked me to

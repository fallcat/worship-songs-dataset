You're hand was wrapped around the bottle 
 You're arm wrapped around her waist 
 You were running that full throttle 
 Big smile upon your face 
 You were the life of the party 
 But it was only in your mind 
 I hate to be the one to tell you 
 You didn't have a good time 
 Well I bet you don't remember 
 Knelling in that bathroom stall 
 Praying for salvation 
 And cursing alcohol 
 And you went right back to drinking 
 Like everything was fine 
 But let's be honest with each other 
 You didn't have a good time 
 So take a good hard look in the mirror 
 And drink that image down 
 I'm truth that you can't run from 
 I'm the conscience you can't drown 
 And the happiness you want so bad 
 You ain't gonna find 
 Until you start believing 
 You didn't have a good time 
 When you woke up this morning 
 I guess you just assumed 
 That you got something out of 
 The empty bottles in this room 
 There ain't an angel that can save you 
 Whyen you're listening to the wine 
 And the demons want to tell you 
 You didn't have a good time 
 Somebody had to tell you 
 You didn't have a good time

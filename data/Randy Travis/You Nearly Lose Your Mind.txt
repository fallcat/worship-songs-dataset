Now if you love your momma 
 And try to treat her right 
 But she keeps on fussing at you 
 Everyday and night 
 'Cause she's gonna trifle on ya' 
 They do it every time 
 And when your baby starts a stepping 
 Lord you nearly lose you mind 
 Now if your momma's mean 
 Take a tip from me 
 Lock her up at home lord 
 But hang on to that key 
 'Cause she's gonna trifle on ya' 
 They do it every time 
 And when your baby starts a stepping 
 Lord you nearly lose you mind 
 But if you momma's good 
 I'll tell you what to do 
 Give her lots of loving 
 But watch her closely too 
 'Cause she's gonna trifle on ya' 
 They do it every time 
 And when your baby starts a stepping 
 Lord you nearly lose you mind 
 When you come to your momma 
 An' find your clothes ain't clean 
 You can bet your slipping 
 If you know just what I mean 
 'Cause she's gonna trifle on ya' 
 They do it every time 
 And when your baby starts a stepping 
 Lord you nearly lose you mind 
 Now you may have a momma 
 That says that she is true 
 But wait till you are down and out 
 And really need her too 
 'Cause she's gonna trifle on ya' 
 They do it every time 
 And when your baby starts a stepping 
 Lord you nearly lose you mind 
 Now I've been a lot of places 
 There's nothing I ain't done 
 But when it comes to women 
 I don't trust a one 
 'Cause she's gonna trifle on ya' 
 They do it every time 
 And when your baby starts a stepping 
 Lord you nearly lose you mind

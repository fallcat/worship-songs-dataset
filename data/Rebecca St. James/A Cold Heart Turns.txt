Power thunder, lightning bolts 
 Rushing wind, a waterfall 
 Babies' cry, a mother's tears 
 Humming river, rustling leaves 
 He's calling loud and clearly 
 He's saying "Won't you hear Me" 
 We see Him everywhere 
 And still we roll on by 
 Winter snow, a fire's warmth 
 Summer's day, a cold heart turns 
 Peaceful place, a helping hand 
 Kindly words, a smiling face 
 He was God but one of us 
 A king who had a servant's heart 
 Born to die so we might live 
 His reason was His Father's will 
 Repeat 
 Power thunder, lightning bolts 
 Rushing wind, a waterfall 
 Winter snow, a fire's warmth 
 Summer's day, a cold heart turns

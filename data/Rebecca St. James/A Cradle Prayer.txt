Jesus I love You my Lord my life 
 Where would I be without You 
 Here in the quiet, the still the night 
 I am in awe of You 
 Trials may come and friends they may go 
 What really matters is You, my Lord 
 Beautiful Savior my God, my Friend 
 I am in awe of You 
 Trials may come and friends they may go 
 What really matters is You, My Lord 
 Jesus I love You my Lord my life 
 Where would I be without You 
 Here in the quiet, the still the night 
 I am in awe of You 
 Why would You, Creator and King, 
 Come as a baby for all, for me 
 Beautiful Savior my God, my friend 
 I am in awe of You, Lord 
 I am in awe of You

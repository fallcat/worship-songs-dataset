I'm feeeling like the eagle that rises 
 Flies above the earth and its troubles 
 Oh yes he knows that there are valleys below 
 But under his wings there's a stronger power 
 Oh Father- You are my strength 
 On you I wait upon 
 Chrous: 
 You make the road rise up to meet me 
 You make the sun shine warm upon my face 
 The wind is at my back and the ran falls soft 
 God I lift You high -- You are my Abba 
 Running in this race to the finish line 
 The only road for me is the narrow 
 Not gonna stop or even look to the side 
 When I fix my eyes upon You Jesus 
 Oh Father (Abba) - you are my strength 
 Now more then ever 
 Repeat 
 When you've run to far - and the road is long 
 Can't walk another mile - He is waiting 
 Hope in Him again - He'll renew you 
 Then you will rise, gather up your wings and fly... 
 Chrous 
 Repeat 
 Do you not know? 
 Have you not heard? 
 He gives strength to the weary 
 To those who hope in Him 
 They will soar like eagles

I cannot tell you all the reasons why 
 Jesus in His wisdom took an interest in my life 
 It must be endless, the boundaries of His grace 
 For He is patient with us and worthy to be praised 
 For above all things He is powerful 
 And above all things He is the King 
 And above all things 
 He is merciful 
 For above all things He thought of me 
 I can't conceive it, the torture of the cross 
 The Author of creation, gave us life at His own cost 
 And all those present thought the grave would be the end 
 But Jesus rose above it, and so will I my friend

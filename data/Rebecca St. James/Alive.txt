I always wanted to be free 
 Till I was bound and then 
 I always wanted my own way 
 Till I saw that I find my life when 
 I lose it 
 You make me come alive 
 You make me come alive 
 I found the secret 
 It's only when I let go of what I want in this life 
 You make me come alive 
 I used to think that me, myself and I were all that mattered 
 But You've shown me all this world can give 
 Cannot compare to the joy that comes from 
 Giving away 
 And as I follow after You 
 Now I need to 
 Leave my past, myself behind 
 This I will do 
 I always wanted to be free 
 Till I was bound and then 
 I always wanted my own way 
 Till I saw You 
 Till I saw You

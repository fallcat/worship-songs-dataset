 Yesterday, mid-afternoon 
 My thoughts kept turning back to You 
 In my mind You'd flood my head 
 With echoes of the things You said 
 Hey I cannot explain 
 The thought of who You are 
 Makes me understand 
 If I see my world come tumbling down 
 If I feel my heart touching the ground 
 You're all around me 
 If everything starts to fade away 
 And all I can do is call Your name 
 You're all around me 
 Yesterday, mid-afternoon 
 My thoughts kept turning back to You 
 From the sky stretched into space 
 To the sunshine on my face 
 Hey I cannot explain 
 I see You in it all 
 I hear You call my name 
 If I see my world come tumbling down 
 If I feel my heart touching the ground 
 You're all around me 
 If everything starts to fade away 
 And all I can do is call Your name 
 You're all around me 
 If I see my world come tumbling down 
 If I feel my heart touching the ground 
 You're all around me 
 If I see my world come tumbling down 
 If I feel my heart touching the ground 
 You're all around me 
 If everything starts to fade away 
 And all I can do is call Your name 
 You're all around me 
 If I see my world come tumbling down 
 If I feel my heart touching the ground 
 You're all around me 
 If everything starts to fade away 
 And all I can do is call Your name 
 You're still all around me

This land is built on freedom 
 Life and liberty for all 
 We've declared our independence 
 So we will depend on the One who made it all 
 Honor God, America 
 The land of the free 
 Honor God, America 
 O land of liberty 
 Honor God 
 So let justice flow like water 
 And let mercy fall like rain 
 Those who honor Him, He'll honor 
 Together let's raise up the One who has made us 
 Honor God, America 
 The land of the free 
 Honor God, America 
 O land of liberty 
 Honor God 
 From the mountains to the prairies 
 From the desert to the cities 
 From the heartland to the coastland 
 Let our hearts turn to the Lord's hand 
 From the mountains to the prairies 
 From the desert to the cities 
 From the heartland to the coastland 
 Let our hearts turn to the Lord 
 Honor God, America 
 The land of the free 
 Honor God, America 
 O land of liberty 
 Honor God

Words and Music by Geoff Bullock 
 We behold the Lamb of God, 
 Risen for the sins of man, 
 And we behold Him, 
 In majesty, 
 We behold the Lamb of God. 
 We will see the risen Lord, 
 We rise and His command, 
 And we behold Him, 
 In righteousness, 
 We will see the risen Lord. 
 Hallelujah, hosanna in the highest, 
 Come bow before Him, 
 And worship Him, 
 The risen Lamb, the Son of God. 
 Hallelujah, hosanna, in the highest, 
 Come bow before Him, 
 And worship Him, 
 The risen Lam, the Son of God. 
 We behold the Lamb of God, 
 Risen for the sins of man, 
 And we behold Him, 
 In majesty, 
 Oh we behold the Lamb of God.

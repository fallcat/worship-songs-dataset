As the coming of the Lord draws near 
 Get ready to meet the King 
 He's coming in the clouds of Heaven 
 He's coming back again 
 With a shout he will return 
 With power and glory 
 As the coming of the Lord draws near 
 Get ready to meet the King 
 And the Sa 
 Ints shout AMEN! 
 As they meet Him in the air 
 And the Saints shout AMEN! 
 Jesus Christ is coming back again!

Alone in the valley 
 I cried for You to fill me with 
 Your peace 
 So when the lightning strikes 
 Thunder rolls around me 
 Still I live in peace 
 You ask that I... 
 Be still and know 
 You are God 
 (2x) 
 You are God... 
 When the fires rage 
 When the storms surrounds me 
 Still I live in peace 
 Though the mountains fall 
 Crash into the ocean 
 Still I live in peace 
 You ask that I... 
 Be still and know 
 You are God 
 (2x) 
 You ask that I... 
 Be still and know 
 You are God 
 (2x) 
 You are God... 
 Lead me through the valley 
 Lead me by the streams 
 Restore me and draw me to You God 
 To You I lift my soul 
 To You who makes me whole 
 Gently You hold me close to You 
 Ooh... close to You... ooh... 
 Be still and know 
 You are God 
 (4x) 
 Be still and know 
 You are God 
 (2x) 
 You are God... 
 You're near me 
 You love me 
 You hold me 
 You reach me 
 You steal me 
 You move me 
 You draw me to You God 
 (2x) 
 You are God... (2x) 
 (You are God...) 2x 
 You steal me, You draw me to You 
 (You are God...) 2x 
 When the fires rage, still I live in peace... 
 You are God...

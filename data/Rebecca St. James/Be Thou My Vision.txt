Be Thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart 
 Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art 
 Thou my best thought by day or by night 
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light 
 Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word 
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord 
 Be Thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight 
 Be Thou my armour and be Thou my might 
 Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise 
 Thou my inheritance, now and always 
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart 
 High king of heaven my treasure Thou art 
 High king of heaven, when battle is done 
 Grant heaven's joy to me, oh bright heaven's sun 
 Christ of my own heart, whatever befall 
 Still be my vision, my ruler of all

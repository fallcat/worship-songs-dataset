"Do you see me?" 
 The question's in her eyes 
 "Do you relate, 
 To the pain I can't disgues?" 
 On look beyond what you see 
 The outside is not all there is 
 Will you tell me now when did I see 
 You in need of water 
 Oh and tell me now when did I see you 
 Hungary on the streets 
 God I hear you calling out to me 
 In the voices of my used to be's 
 Calling me to reach beyond my world 
 To this beautiful stranger 
 Beautiful stranger 
 He does not look like everyone else 
 And has not hidden anywhere I know 
 You ask me to be your hands and 
 Show him now that he is loved 
 Tell me now when did I see 
 You in need of water 
 Oh and tell me now when did I see you 
 Hungary on the streets 
 God I hear you calling out to me 
 In the voices of my used to be's 
 Calling me to reach beyond my world 
 This beauty that lies deep within 
 Waiting to be discovered 
 God help me see what you see 
 And turn it into stone 
 Tell me now when did I see 
 You in need of water 
 Tell me now when did I see you 
 Hungary on the streets 
 God I hear you callin' out to me 
 In the voices of my used to be's 
 Callin' me to reach beyond my world 
 Won't you tell me now when did I see 
 You in need of water 
 Oh, and tell me now when did I see you 
 Hungary on the streets 
 God I hear you callin' out to me 
 In the voices of my used to be's 
 Callin' me to reach beyond my world 
 To this beautiful stranger

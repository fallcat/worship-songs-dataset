This is the air I breathe 
 This is the air I breathe 
 Your holy presence 
 Living in me 
 This is my daily bread 
 This is my daily bread 
 Your very word 
 Spoken to me 
 And I, I'm desperate for You 
 And I, I'm lost without You 
 This is the air I breathe 
 This is the air I breathe 
 Your holy presence 
 Living in me 
 And I, I'm desperate for You 
 And I, I'm lost without You 
 Desperate for You 
 Desperate for You 
 Desperate for You 
 Lost without You 
 Lost without You 
 Lost without You 
 Lost without You 
 I'm lost without You 
 I'm desperate for You 
 And I, I'm desperate for You 
 And I, I'm so lost without You 
 And I, I'm desperate for You 
 And I, I'm lost without You 
 I'm lost without You 
 I'm lost without You 
 Jesus 
 I'm lost without You 
 I'm desperate for You

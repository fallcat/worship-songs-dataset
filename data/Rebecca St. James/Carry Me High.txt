They laugh 'cause they see 
 I live for more than me 
 They point their fingers, 
 Push me nearer to the flame 
 The say, "We serve no one" 
 "We just live to please ourselves" 
 All men serve something... 
 Father, carry me high, lift me to the sky 
 Let me be where you are 
 Hold me, ever so closely, let me know your mercy 
 Let me be where you are 
 They can laugh, but let them see 
 You are the hope in me 
 They can point their fingers 
 Push me nearer to the flame 
 God, You can save me from the fire 
 I'm Yours, even if you don't 
 Whatever comes I take this vow 
 I will never bow... 
 I will never bow... 
 Until you find something 
 Worth dying for 
 You're not really living 
 I will never bow... 
 Repeat 
 Father, carry me high, lift me to the sky 
 Let me be where you are 
 Repeat 
 I want to be where you are 
 I will never bow

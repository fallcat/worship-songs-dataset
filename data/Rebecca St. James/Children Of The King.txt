Words and Music by Phil Butson 
 We're children of the King, 
 Lift your up heads high, 
 Show the whole world right, 
 We're children of the King, 
 Filled with power, 
 Lord this hour, 
 We're children of the King. 
 As revival fire, 
 Spread throughout this land, 
 Lifting Jesus higher, 
 We will make our stand, 
 And together we, 
 Have eternity, 
 To praise Him, 
 To praise Him. 
 We're children of the King, 
 Lift your heads up high, 
 Show the whole world right, 
 We're children of the King, 
 Filled with power, 
 Lord this hour, 
 We're children of the King. 
 Set the captives free, 
 Hear our battle cry, 
 Bringing liberty, 
 That's why Jesus died, 
 And together we, 
 Have eternity, 
 To praise Him, 
 To praise Him. 
 As revival fire, 
 Spread throughout this land, 
 Lifting Jesus higher, 
 We will make our stand, 
 And together we, 
 Have eternity, 
 To praise Him, 
 To praise Him. 
 We're children of the King, 
 Lift your heads up high, 
 Show the whole world right, 
 We're children of the King, 
 Filled with power, 
 Lord this hour, 
 We're children of the King. 
 We're children of the King, 
 Lift your heads up high, 
 Show the whole world right, 
 We're children of the King, 
 Filled with power, 
 Lord this hour, 
 We're children of the King. 
 We're children of the King, 
 Lift your heads up high, 
 Show the whole world right, 
 We're children of the King, 
 Filled with power, 
 Lord this hour, 
 We're children of the King. 
 We're children of the King, 
 Lift your heads up high, 
 Show the whole world right, 
 We're children of the King, 
 Filled with power, 
 Lord this hour, 
 We're children of the King.

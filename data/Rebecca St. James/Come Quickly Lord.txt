You're close, very close 
 But Lord I miss You 
 Here's where I find hope 
 You're coming soon 
 And I long so much to see You - that I cry 
 Everywhere are the signs that the end is near 
 I say 
 Come quickly, Lord 
 When the sun grows dark 
 And the moon will shine no more 
 Quickly Lord 
 When the stars fall out of the sky above 
 Won't You come, dear Lord 
 Be ready - is what I want to be 
 When You come for me 
 No sitting on my hands 
 I won't be caught sleeping 
 And I long so much to see You 
 That I reach for the sky 
 And I lift up my hands 
 And I hold them high... high 
 Come quickly, Lord 
 When the sun grows dark 
 And the moon will shine no more 
 Quickly Lord 
 When the stars fall out of the sky above 
 Won't You come, dear Lord 
 Come dear Lord, dear Lord 
 Come quickly Lord Jesus - please come for me 
 Come quickly Lord Jesus - please come for me 
 Come take us away to be with You 
 Come take us away 
 Come quickly, Lord 
 When the sun grows dark 
 And the moon will shine no more 
 Quickly Lord 
 When the stars fall out of the sky above 
 (Repeat) 
 Come take us away to be with You 
 Come take us away

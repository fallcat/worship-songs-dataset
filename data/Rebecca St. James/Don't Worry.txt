On the corner of Fifth and Broadway 
 I was walking to the grocery store on Third 
 I saw a man up on a box 
 He seemed a bit unorthodox 
 And he was preaching up a storm 
 As I passed on by he said 
 Don't worry about your life 
 'Cause if you hold it too close you lose it 
 Don't worry about your life 
 So won't you let go before it's gone 
 A little further on I saw a beggar on the street 
 He asked for change and then gives me his life story 
 Says he was a millionaire, made some bad decisions there 
 Now a dollar fifty would feed him for a week 
 And he said 
 Don't worry about your life 
 'Cause if you hold it too close you lose it 
 Don't worry about your life 
 So won't you let go before it's gone 
 Don't worry about your life 
 'Cause if you hold it too close you lose it 
 Don't worry about your life 
 So won't you let go before it's gone 
 Then I see the birds 
 I watch them fly 
 They've got everything they need 
 They show me why I can be free 
 Knowing You will care for me 
 Finally at the grocery store 
 My mind is filled with many thoughts 
 As I bump into a girl I knew from high school 
 She said "What's different about you girl?" 
 And I smiled and said this is what I know is true 
 And I pass it right along to you 
 Don't worry about your life 
 'Cause if you hold it too close you lose it 
 Don't worry about your life 
 So won't you let go before it's gone 
 Don't worry about your life 
 'Cause if you hold it too close you lose it 
 Don't worry about your life 
 So won't you let go before it's gone 
 Don't worry about your life 
 'Cause if you hold it too close you lose it 
 Don't worry about your life 
 So won't you let go before it's gone

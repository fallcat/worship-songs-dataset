If it weren't for You Lord I don't know where I'd be 
 I could fill the hours but never fill the need 
 I would still be searching, looking for the truth 
 But I've found a new life that only comes from You 
 Everything I do, Let it be in Your name, let it be for Your Glory, let it be for You 
 Everything I say, let it be in Your name 
 Let it be for Your glory, let it be for Your sake 
 'Cause I wanna please You, in everything I do 
 I want the world to see You when they look at me 
 And I want the world to hear You in every word I speak 
 So let my words be Your words and my actions too, so they'll find the new life that I have found in You 
 You filled up my empty heart, give the strength so that I can go on 
 You're the reason that my life has changed, and that's why I say...

If I could speak with tongues of angels 
 If I could write the future in the sky 
 If I could know the wisdom of the ages 
 But have no love, what would it mean? 
 For the love of God 
 Let this be my motivation 
 For the love of God 
 In this love I'm recreated 
 For the love of God 
 It's the reason for giving love away 
 For the love of God 
 If I have faith 
 Faith to move a mountain 
 If I give all I own to the poor 
 If I surrender my body to the flames 
 But have no love, I have nothing 
 When I'm gone let it be said 
 That I loved You more than anything 
 While I'm here may all men see 
 Your love in me

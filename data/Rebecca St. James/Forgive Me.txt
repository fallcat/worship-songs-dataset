For all the times I've failed You, Lord 
 Forgive me 
 For all the ways I've fallen short 
 Lord, forgive me now 
 God, I'm so in need of grace 
 I fall upon my face 
 Forgive me 
 You see the tears fall down my face 
 Forgive me 
 Take my fear, Lord, take my shame 
 Lord, forgive me now 
 Purify me, make me new 
 Like only You can do 
 Forgive me now 
 Lord, we come to honor You 
 We are forgiven 
 We bring our love and thanks to You 
 We are forgiven now 
 God we praise You for Your grace 
 Before You we are raised 
 Forgiven 
 God we praise You for Your grace 
 Before You we are raised 
 Forgiven 
 Forgiven

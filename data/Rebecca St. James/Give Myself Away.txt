I can't stay here anymore 
 There's no time for me to hideaway 
 Waste another day 
 But You oh Lord I can't ignore 
 Or the chance to know that I can't change 
 Before it's too late 
 Here and now - I lay it all down 
 I take the road that leads to You 
 I won't look back, I won't turn around 
 I give myself away to You 
 Here and now - I lay it down 
 I give myself away to You today 
 It's a mystery to me 
 How I'm tempted by the lies that shine 
 Make me blind 
 I try to run -I try to flee 
 From the sin that's had me hypnotized 
 I've realized 
 Here and now - I lay it all down 
 I take the road that leads to You 
 I won't look back, I won't turn around 
 I give myself away to You 
 Here and now - I lay it down 
 I give myself away to You today 
 I can't stay here anymore 
 There's no time for me to hideaway 
 Here and now - I lay it all down 
 I take the road that leads to You 
 I won't look back, I won't turn around 
 I give myself away to You 
 Here and now - I lay it down 
 I give myself away to You today 
 (Repeat) 
 I give myself away 
 I give myself away 
 I give myself away

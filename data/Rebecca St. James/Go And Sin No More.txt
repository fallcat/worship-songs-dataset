I've sinned come on my knees 
 For I'm not worthy of Your love 
 How could You die for me? 
 Such grace can only come from God 
 Oh Lord, You search and You know me 
 You see me inside out 
 God You alone can forgive me 
 Erase my fear and my doubt 
 Father You pick me up 
 I feel like a child in Your arms 
 I don't deserve this love but 
 I hear Your voice Lord Jesus 
 Go and sin no more 
 He said "I will not condemn you, 
 I'll forgive and I'll forget it all. 
 Go and sin no more. 
 My child let me remind you 
 It is I who'll lead and guide you as you go" 
 You are my purpose 
 You are the reason that I live 
 I want to be like You 
 Help me to love and to forgive 
 God let me not be distracted 
 Lord help me focus on You 
 Keep sin from ruling my life, Lord 
 Make me holy and pure 
 Father You pick me up 
 I feel like a child in Your arms 
 I don't deserve this love but 
 I hear Your voice Lord Jesus 
 Wipe, wipe away 
 Take, take away 
 Break, break away 
 Fill my life, make it right 
 Father help me, Father help me go 
 He said, "I will not condemn you, no 
 Go and sin no more. 
 My child let me remind you 
 It is I who'll lead and guide you as you go" 
 I've sinned come on my knees 
 How could You die for me 
 Search my heart 
 Know my thoughts 
 See me inside out and all throughout me 
 You alone can forgive me 
 You always pick me up 
 Like a child 
 In Your arms 
 I could stay with you forever here 
 (Repeat twice)

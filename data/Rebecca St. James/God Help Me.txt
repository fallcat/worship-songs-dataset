From the deep I cry 
 I am needing change in my life 
 I have let the cold creep in and lock my ability to feel (deeply) 
 Just now a shaft of light shot through my soul 
 Opening up the windows and the doors 
 Reaching to the corners and my flaws 
 Showing my need 
 I'm running out of time to live 
 Running out of love to give 
 Running out of life within 
 God help me 
 I don't care who stares 
 Never want to be what I have been again 
 Grace has taken over and drawn me in and I am embracing it 
 'Cause now I see Your light drawing me close 
 Overwhelming love I don't deserve 
 But I'll take the hope You bring, You hold it out to me 
 Without You

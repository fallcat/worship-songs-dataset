Lord of all creation 
 Of water, earth and sky 
 The heavens are your tabernacle 
 Glory to the Lord on high 
 God of wonders beyond our galaxy 
 You are holy, holy 
 The universe declares your majesty 
 You are holy, holy 
 Lord of heaven and earth 
 Lord of heaven and earth 
 Early in the morning 
 I will celebrate the light 
 When I stumble in the darkness 
 I will lift your name by night 
 God of wonders beyond our galaxy 
 You are holy, holy 
 The universe declares your majesty 
 You are holy, holy 
 Lord of heaven and earth 
 Lord of heaven and earth 
 Hallelujah... to the Lord of heaven and earth 
 Hallelujah... to the Lord of heaven and earth 
 Hallelujah... to the Lord of heaven and earth 
 God of wonders beyond our galaxy 
 You are holy, holy 
 The universe declares your majesty 
 You are holy, holy 
 You are holy, holy 
 You are holy, holy

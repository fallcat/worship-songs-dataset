GOD 
 He made the night He made the day 
 Spread the Earth upon the waters 
 Made the heavens and the rain 
 Look at the sky see its design 
 The very same Creator is the One who gave us life 
 And what is man that He's mindful of us? 
 We're merely clay in His hands 
 And what am I that He loves me so much He would die? 
 All that I can say is... 
 It's God! Only God! 
 Can you see, can you hear, can you touch, can you feel? 
 It's God! Only God! 
 I can't explain any other way, 'cause it's God. 
 Inside us all there is a void. 
 All mankind is searching for the one who fills the soul 
 In Him there's hope in Him there's life. 
 The world cries for a Savior that's right before their eyes. 
 And what is man that He takes us in as His children to be His own? 
 And what are we that He wants to be our Father? 
 All that I can say is... 
 Lord I praise You for Your endless love 
 Your boundless grace 
 I stand here amazed 
 God! Truly God! 
 I can't explain any other way, 'cause it's God 
 God! Truly God! 
 Can ya see? Can ya hear? Can you touch? Can ya feel Him? 
 God! Truly God! 
 I can't explain any other way, 'cause it's God. 
 God! Truly God! 
 It's God! Truly God! 
 It's God! Truly God! 
 I can't explain any other way, 'cause it's God.

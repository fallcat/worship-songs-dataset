This life is such a violent tide 
 Tosses us from side to side to side 
 Fast forward like magnetic tape 
 Then dragging like a riptide day to day 
 Bounced around like surfers on a board 
 But when we hit the beach of Evermore 
 There'll be sunshine, no more hard times 
 On the Gold Coast, the Gold Coast 
 Dancing all night on the north side 
 Where the Spirit frees us 
 And the wind cries, "Jesus - Selah" 
 The setting sun, the Southern Cross 
 The crimson moon, the limbo of the lost 
 The breaking waves of saving grace 
 Against the shining shore where angels play 
 We'll light a candle in the sacred sand 
 And celebrate the luau of the Lamb 
 There'll be sunshine, no more hard times 
 On the Gold Coast, the Gold Coast 
 Dancing all night on the north side 
 Where the Spirit frees us 
 And the wind cries, "Jesus - Selah" 
 There'll be sunshine, no more hard times 
 On the Gold Coast, the Gold Coast 
 Dancing all night on the north side 
 Where the Spirit frees us 
 And the wind cries, "Jesus - Selah"

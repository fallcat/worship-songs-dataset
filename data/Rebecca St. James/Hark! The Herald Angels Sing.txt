Hark the herald angels sing 
 "Glory to the newborn King! 
 Peace on earth and mercy mild 
 God and sinners reconciled" 
 Joyful, all ye nations rise 
 Join the triumph of the skies 
 With the angelic host proclaim: 
 "Christ is born in Bethlehem" 
 Hark! The herald angels sing 
 "Glory to the newborn King!" 
 Christ by highest heav'n adored 
 Christ the everlasting Lord! 
 Late in time behold Him come 
 Offspring of a Virgin's womb 
 Veiled in flesh the Godhead see 
 Hail the incarnate Deity 
 Pleased as man with man to dwell 
 Jesus, our Emmanuel 
 Hark! The herald angels sing 
 "Glory to the newborn King!"

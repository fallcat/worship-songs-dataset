I will bless the Lord at all times 
 His praise shall be continually in my mouth. 
 My soul shall make her boast the Lord 
 The humble shall hear thereof and be glad. 
 Oh, magnify the Lord with me, 
 And let us exalt His name together. 
 He is exalted 
 The King is exalted, and I 
 I will praise Him 
 He is exalted 
 Forever exalted, and I 
 I will praise Him. 
 He is the Lord 
 Forever His Truth shall reign 
 Heaven and Earth rejoice in His Holy Name. 
 He is exalted 
 The King is exalted on high. 
 He is exalted 
 The King is exalted, and I 
 I will praise Him 
 He is exalted 
 Forever exalted, and I 
 I will praise Him. 
 He is the Lord 
 Forever His Truth shall reign 
 Heaven and Earth rejoice in His Holy Name. 
 He is exalted 
 The King is exalted on high.

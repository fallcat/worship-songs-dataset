Here I am to worship, 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 Here I am to worship, 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that 
 You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me

Here I Am 
 God asked a question 
 Whom shall I send? 
 Now what will we answer? 
 Will we go and do as He says 
 All that He longs is a heart to ready willing and waiting 
 Here I am 
 I surrender my life to the use of Your plan 
 Here I am 
 I will do as You say I will go where You send 
 Here I am 
 Jesus commanded us 
 Go and tell the good news 
 For the harvest is many 
 But the workers are so few 
 All that He wants is a heart believing, serving and loving Him 
 Here I am 
 I surrender my life to the use of Your plan 
 Here I am 
 I will do as You say I will go where You send 
 Here I am (heyea) 
 I surrender my life to the use of Your plan 
 Here I am 
 I will do as You say I will go where You send 
 Lord, I give myself to You 
 My God I trust in You 
 Lord, tell me Your ways 
 Show me how to live 
 Guide me in Your truth 
 And teach me my Saviour 
 Here I am (here I am) 
 I surrender my life to the use of Your plan 
 Here I am 
 I will do as You say I will go as You send 
 Here I am (heyea) 
 I surrender my life to the use of Your plan 
 Here I am 
 I will do as You say I will go where You send

Sometimes my life just don't 
 Make sense at all 
 When the mountains look 
 So big, and my faith 
 Just seems so small 
 And I wake up in the night 
 And feel the dark 
 It's so hot inside my soul 
 There must be blisters 
 On my heart 
 Hold me Jesus 
 I'm shaking like a leaf 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace 
 Hold me Jesus 
 I'm shaking like a leaf 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace 
 (Repeat first verse) 
 Surrender don't come naturally to me 
 I'd rather fight you for something 
 I don't really want, than 
 Take what you give that I don't need 
 Surrender don't come naturally to me 
 And I beat my head against so many walls 
 Now I'm falling down, falling on my knees 
 Saying hold me Jesus 
 Please hold me Jesus 
 Hold me Jesus 
 I'm shaking like a leaf 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace 
 Hold me Jesus 
 'Cause I'm shaking like a leaf 
 You have been King of my glory 
 Won't You be my Prince of Peace 
 My Prince of Peace (3 times) 
 Hold me Jesus (4 times)

There's a story that started on Christmas 
 When a baby was born in the night 
 And those who came far, who followed the star 
 Were seeing a heavenly sight ... 
 A heavenly sight. 
 Well the years hurried by, and the boy, now a man 
 Could make the blind see with a touch of his hand 
 He was born to be King -- he was Rabbi and Priest 
 But the best that he had, he gave to the least ... 
 He gave to the least. 
 He was born and he died, almost 2,000 years ago 
 He laughed and he cried, he felt all the fears we know 
 But what does it matter? A story so strange ... 
 Even if it is true, what does it change? 
 What does it change? 
 Well he spoke like a prophet -- like no one they'd heard 
 This simple young carpenter -- crowds hung on every word 
 He hated injustice -- He taught what is right 
 He said 'I'm the way, and the truth, and the light.' 
 His friends soon believed that truly he was the one. 
 The Savior, Messiah, God's one and only son. 
 But others, they doubted, they did not agree 
 So they took him, they tried him, 
 He died on a tree ... 
 He died on a tree. 
 God has made a way 
 For all who mourn and grieve 
 Death will never be the end 
 If you just believe. 
 There is nothing left to fear 
 Nothing Heaven knows 
 For he died for us to give us life 
 And to give us hope He rose 
 He died for us to give us life 
 And to give us hope He rose.

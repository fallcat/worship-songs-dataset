Words and Music by Geoff Bullock 
 I'm your child, 
 I give my life to you, 
 Wholly available, 
 Faithful and true. 
 And in my life, 
 Let your light be seen, 
 So that the world may know, 
 I am your child. 
 Take me, Lord, 
 I am your child, 
 Send me, Lord, 
 Set my heart on fire. 
 'Cause I'm your child, 
 I give my life to you, 
 Wholly available, 
 Faithful and true. 
 And in my life, 
 Let your light be seen, 
 So that the world may know, 
 I am your child. 
 Take me, Lord, 
 I am your child, 
 Send me, Lord, 
 Set my heart on fire. 
 Take me, Lord, 
 I am your child, 
 Send me, Lord, 
 Set my heart on fire. 
 Take me, Lord, 
 I am your child, 
 Send me, Lord, 
 Set my heart on fire.

Yes, I know that You have paved a path for me 
 Yes, I know that You see what I do and don't need 
 But when it comes to the deepest things 
 I have a hard time relinquishing control 
 Letting go 
 God, it hurts to give You what I must lay down 
 But when I let go, freedom's found 
 God, it hurts to give You what I've held so dear 
 Because of Your love it's clear 
 I can trust You with this 
 I can trust You with me 
 I can trust You 
 Lord, I know that You are worthy of my trust 
 For You have shown me time and time again 
 You're faithful and yet 
 I'm so scared of letting go of this 
 Afraid of what You might do with it 
 How could I forget who You are like this 
 Me forsaking 
 Heart is breaking 
 I let go of what I've held so tight 
 Freedom's mine now 
 For the taking 
 I move in faith, not by sight 
 Let Your will be done

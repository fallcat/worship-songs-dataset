Wide open my life is now 
 I hide no more behind the mask 
 And what you see is what I am, it's reality 
 For too long I walked alone 
 I tried to prove that I was strong 
 But now that part of me is gone 
 And I am free, free to be 
 I need you 
 And there is nothing I must prove 
 For you are a friend who loves at all times 
 I thank God for you 
 I love you 
 I need you 
 I think back to all the times 
 That you have shown the meaning of love and grace 
 Your embrace inspires me 
 To be better 
 And now I want to be 
 The one who loves you like you love me 
 And comforts you with the comfort I've been given from above 
 Now I'm giving you my love 
 'Cause

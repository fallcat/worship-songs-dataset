It's a hurry up world and my days go flying by 
 But I don't want to forget to thank You for my life 
 And in my blindness You give eyes to see 
 That in my struggle You will fight for me 
 So from my heart I've got to say... 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Father for the gift of Your Son 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Jesus for the things You have done 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Spirit for the peace that is here in my heart 
 Long before I was born I belonged to You alone 
 You have always been there, I was never on my own 
 And I feel Your presence in my darkest hour 
 When I am weakest, then I know Your power 
 You are the light that shines in me 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Father for the gift of Your Son 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Jesus for the things You have done 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Spirit for the peace that is here in my heart 
 Nobody cares for me like You 
 Cause nobody loves 
 The way you do, You're faithful and true 
 You saw me drowning and You rescued me 
 You know I've got to say... 
 I've got to say I thank You Lord 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Father for the gift of Your Son 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Jesus for the things You have done 
 (I thank You Lord) I thank You Spirit for the peace that is here in my heart

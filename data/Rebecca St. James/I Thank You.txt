There oh 
 There was a time when I felt 
 Alone and afraid 
 But You came close to me 
 And I'm forever changed 
 'Cause something stirred inside me 
 So much more than I can say 
 I thank You for believing in me 
 You've given me Your all 
 Now I'll never be alone 
 I thank You 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You've held onto my soul 
 And I'm never letting go 
 I'm never letting go 
 Your love is so amazing 
 Beyond compare 
 And now I can't imagine life 
 Without You there 
 For You have healed my spirit 
 I'm resting in Your loving care 
 I thank You for believing in me 
 You've given me Your all 
 Now I'll never be alone 
 I thank You 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You've held onto my soul 
 And I'm never letting go 
 I'm never letting go 
 I'm never letting go 
 Never letting go 
 Something stirred inside me 
 Something I just can't deny 
 For you have healed my spirit 
 Your mercy has restored my life 
 And I thank You for believing in me 
 You've given me Your all 
 Now I'll never be alone 
 I thank You 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You've held onto my soul 
 I thank You for believing in me 
 You've given me Your all 
 Now I'll never be alone 
 I thank You 
 You never stopped loving me 
 You've held onto my soul 
 And I'm never letting go 
 I'm never letting go 
 I'm never letting go 
 I'm never letting go 
 I'm not letting go 
 I thank You 
 For believing me 
 Never letting go 
 Thank You

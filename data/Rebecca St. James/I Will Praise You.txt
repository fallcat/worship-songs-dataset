Joy comes in the morning 
 The sun is rising 
 And I wait for You 
 Streams flow in the desert 
 There's an oasis 
 And I wait for You 
 Whatever the storm 
 Whatever is lost 
 Whatever it takes 
 Whatever the cost 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You 
 Faith, faith is the substance 
 Of things we hope for 
 So I wait for You 
 Hope, hope and a future 
 Are Your plans for me 
 So I wait for You 
 I see the waters rising 
 I feel the coming storm 
 When fear is overwhelming 
 I hear, "Peace be still"

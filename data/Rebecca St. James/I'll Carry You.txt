I know that look in your eyes 
 I see the pain behind your smile 
 Please don't hold it all inside 
 Together we can run 
 To the finish line 
 And when you are tired 
 I'll carry you 
 I can't walk this road without you 
 You cannot go it alone 
 We were never meant to make it on our own 
 When the load becomes heavy 
 And your feet too tired to walk 
 I will carry you and we'll be carried on 
 Share your burden now 
 I will listen 
 And when I'm weak 
 Will you hold me to the truth 
 That we can go on, for we are carried 
 Three strands of chord 
 Cannot be easily torn... 
 I can't walk this road without you 
 You cannot go it alone 
 We were never meant to make it on our own 
 When the load becomes heavy 
 And your feet too tired to walk 
 I will carry you and we'll be carried on 
 God will carry us (4 times) 
 Before I say one more word 
 Hear me say I love You 
 My love comes from a heart that overflows 
 With love Who fills me 
 Comforts me 
 Comforts you, 
 With arms stretched out He said, 
 "I'll carry you" 
 I can't walk this road without you 
 You cannot go it alone 
 We were never meant to make it on our own 
 When the load becomes heavy 
 And your feet too tired to walk 
 I will carry you and we'll be carried on 
 (Repeat)

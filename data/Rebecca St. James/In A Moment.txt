In a moment, everyone falls silent 
 To hear the mighty trumpet 
 Split the eastern sky 
 Just imagine the King of all Creation 
 Riding through the heavens 
 Returning for His bride 
 Alleluia, alleluia 
 Hear the sound of Heaven ring 
 Alleluia, alleluia 
 All the earth will bow and sing 
 All the broken, they're no longer broken 
 As they dance before Him 
 A radiant debut 
 And the lion walks beside the lamb and 
 All is well again 
 He's making all things new 
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia 
 Hear the sound of the crowd, sing alleluia 
 Face down on the ground, victorious 
 Hear the sound of the crowd, sing alleluia 
 Face down on the ground, victorious 
 Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia 
 Hear the sound of the crowd, sing alleluia 
 Face down on the ground, victorious 
 Hear the sound of the crowd, sing alleluia 
 Face down on the ground 
 Alleluia

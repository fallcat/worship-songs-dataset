You said the words, and made the heavens, 
 You breathed the stars and put their place in the sky. 
 You waved your hand, painted a sunset. 
 You smiled and gave a heartbeat life, 
 Craziest thing, 
 That your holy hands made everything I see. 
 It's so hard to believe that your God of creations, 
 Say, I've got this power in me. 
 There is strength to move a mountain. 
 I'm me, There is faith to walk on water. 
 In me, if I just believe, 
 The way in the truth and the light 
 Is in me. 
 In Me. 
 So please remind me, when I feel useless, 
 That my flesh and bone is more than meets the eye. 
 Because you burn, like a fire within me 
 And there is nothing out of reach when I, 
 Let your spirit loose, and be alive, 'cause 
 In me, there is strength to move a mountain. 
 In me, There is faith to walk on water. 
 In me, if I just believe 
 The way in the truth and the light 
 In me 
 (Slow and low voice) 
 You said the words, you made the heavens, 
 You breathed the stars and put their place in the sky. 
 You waved your hand painted a sunset. 
 You smiled and gave a heartbeat life, 
 You set the world in motion, 
 You put the waves into the ocean, 
 And when it all comes down I've got to believe, 
 That You're God of creation. 
 Say I've got this power in me. 
 There is strength to move a mountain. 
 In me, there is faith to walk on water. 
 In me, there is strength to move a mountain 
 In me, there is faith to walk on water. 
 In me, if I just believe 
 The way in the truth and the light 
 Oh, the way in the truth and the light 
 Is in me. 
 Iiiinnnnnn mmmmeeee 
 In me 
 Yah yah yeah, 
 In me 
 Your strength, in me 
 Your hope, is in me, 
 You said the words that made the heavens, 
 You breathed the stars and put their place up in the sky. 
 You waved your hand, painted a sunset. 
 You smiled and gave a heartbeat life, 
 Crazy to think that your holy hands, 
 Made everything I hear, I feel, I see, 
 Its hard to believe 
 I've got this power in me, (4)

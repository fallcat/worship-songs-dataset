When peace like a river attendeth my way 
 When sorrows like sea billows roll 
 Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say 
 Even so, it is well with my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well, it is well with my soul 
 And Lord haste the day 
 When my faith shall be sight 
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll 
 The trump shall resound 
 And the Lord shall descend 
 Even so, it is well with my soul 
 Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say 
 Even so, it is well with my soul

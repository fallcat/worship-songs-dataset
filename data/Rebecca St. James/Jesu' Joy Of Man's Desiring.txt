Jesu' joy of man's desiring 
 Thou whose love shines down like a guiding light 
 Drawn to Thee with souls aspiring 
 Through our faith we reach a celestial height 
 Son of God we pray we may reach Thee 
 May we live in peace we beseech Thee 
 Open doors of truth unknown 
 As Thy love comes down from the heavenly throne 
 Teach us from Thy heavenly throne 
 Open doors of truth unknown 
 As Thy love comes down from the heavenly throne

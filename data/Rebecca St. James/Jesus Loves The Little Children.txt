Jesus loves the little children 
 All the children of the world 
 Red brown yellow, black or white 
 They are precious in his sight 
 Jesus loves the little children of the world 
 Whether you're rich or whether you're poor, it matters not to Him 
 He remembers where you're going, not where you've been 
 If your heart is troubled, don't worry, don't you fret 
 He knows that you have heard His call, and He won't forget 
 All around the world tonight, His children rest assured 
 That He will watch and He will keep us, safe and secure

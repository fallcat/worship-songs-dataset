Into Your hands I commit my spirit 
 Into Your heart I place mine 
 Into Your will I submit all I am 
 As I let go peace I find 
 And while the background is falling 
 You've found a place I can stand 
 Lean on Your understanding 
 Lean on everything You say 
 Lean on divine intention 
 Lean on every word You mention 
 Into Your hands I submit my troubles 
 Into Yur world I'll unfold 
 And with Your strength I'll replace my weakness 
 As I lie down You restore my soul 
 And while the background is falling 
 You've found a place I can stand 
 In Your hands and I will 
 Lean on Your understanding 
 Lean on everything You say 
 Lean on divine intention 
 Lean on every word You mention

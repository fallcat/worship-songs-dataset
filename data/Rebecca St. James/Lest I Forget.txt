I, I sit in silence here 
 I'm filled with wonder once again 
 I'm overwhelmed by Your beautiful love 
 Now I, I'm falling to my knees, so grateful for the grace You give 
 The love I need I've found in you 
 Lest I forget 
 All of Your goodness 
 The blood You have shed 
 The cross I now remember 
 Lest I forget 
 Lord, You wept tears of blood for me 
 You hung in agony so deep 
 Carried my sin away for good 
 Now I, I take this bread and wine 
 Remembering You love divine 
 You walked through fire to free my soul 
 Lest I forget 
 All of your goodness 
 The blood you have shed 
 The cross I now remember 
 Lest I forget 
 Lest I forget 
 All of your goodness 
 The blood you have shed 
 The cross I now remember 
 Lest I 
 Lest I forget 
 All of your goodness 
 The blood you have shed 
 The cross I now remember 
 Lest I forget 
 Lest I forget 
 (Whispered) 
 Lord, You, wept tears of blood for me 
 Carried my sin away for good 
 Walked through the fire to free my soul 
 I sit in silence here 
 The cross I now remember 
 Lest I forget

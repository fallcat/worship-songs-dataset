And I stand in awe of you... Jesus 
 Yes I stand in awe of you 
 You are God in Heaven 
 And here am I on earth 
 So I'll let my words be few 
 Jesus I am so in love with you 
 And I'll stand in awe of you 
 Yes I'll stand in awe of you 
 And I'll let my words be few 
 Jesus I am so in love with you 
 The simplest of all love songs 
 I want to bring to you 
 And so I'll let my words be few 
 'Cause Jesus I am so in love with you 
 And I'll stand in awe of you, Jesus 
 Yes I'll stand in awe of you 
 And I'll let my words be few 
 Jesus I am so in love 
 And I'll stand in awe of you, Jesus. 
 Yes I'll stand in awe of you 
 And I'll let my words be few 
 I am so in love with you 
 So in love... in love with you 
 In love with you... Jesus. 
 I'm in love with you 
 In love with you 
 In love with you 
 You... 
 In love with you

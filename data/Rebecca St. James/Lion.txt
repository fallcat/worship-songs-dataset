Mysterious 
 That's what I call you 
 I'm curious about you 
 I'm scared and not sure that you are safe 
 But your eyes seem to say that you are good 
 This is not a dream that I'm living 
 This is just a world of your own 
 You took me from all that I knew 
 Shown me how it feels to hope 
 With you with me, facing tomorrow together 
 I can learn to fly 
 Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is 
 An angel 
 Wise eyes, you see the core of me 
 Your gentleness melts me 
 And now I know that words cannot describe 
 The power that I feel when I'm with you 
 This is not a dream that I'm living 
 This is just a world of your own 
 You took me from all that I knew 
 Shown me how it feels to hope 
 With you with me, facing tomorrow together 
 I can learn to fly 
 Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is 
 Peace and power, love forever 
 Who am I to stand before you? 
 I am speechless 
 But in my weakness 
 You are here and all is well 
 This is not a dream that I'm living 
 This is just a world of your own 
 You took me from all that I knew 
 Shown me how it feels to hope 
 With you with me, facing tomorrow together 
 I can learn to fly 
 Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is 
 (An angel) 
 This is not a dream that I'm living 
 This is just a world of your own 
 You took me from all that I knew 
 Shown me how it feels to hope 
 With you with me, facing tomorrow together 
 I can learn to fly 
 Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is 
 An angel

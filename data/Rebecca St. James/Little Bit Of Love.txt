There are millions in the world today 
 Searching for something that can take away the pain 
 Why don't we show them a little of God's love? 
 Show His love 
 Just a little bit o' love goes a long, long way 
 Just a little bit o' love'll make someone's day 
 Just a little bit o' love, give it away 
 Just a little bit o' love, c'mon lets all share 
 Just a little bit o' love, we've got lots to spare 
 Just a little bit o' love, show them we care 
 God so loved us He gave His only Son 
 So we might love each other just as He has done 
 He showed us the way to love everyone 
 He's shown His love 
 God give to us hearts full of His love 
 So we must give His love to everyone 
 Love is patient, love is kind 
 Love is strong and love is blind 
 It don't do wrong, it only forgives 
 The more you give away, the more He'll give-a-you to give

Lord You're beautiful 
 Your face is all I seek 
 For when your eyes are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 Lord You're beautiful 
 Your face is all I seek 
 For when your eyes are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 I want to take Your word and shine it all around 
 First help me just to live it Lord 
 And when I'm doing well help me to never seek a crown 
 For my reward is giving glory to You 
 Lord please light the fire 
 That once burned bright and clear 
 Replace the lamp of my first love 
 That burns with holy fear 
 I want to take Your word and shine it all around 
 First help me just to live it Lord 
 And when I'm doing well help me to never seek a crown 
 For my reward is giving glory to You 
 I can see your face now 
 I can feel your grace now 
 I can see your face now 
 I can feel your grace now 
 It's all I seek 
 It's all I seek 
 Lord You're beautiful 
 Your face is all I seek 
 For when your eyes are on this child 
 Your grace abounds to me 
 I can see your face now 
 I can feel your grace now 
 I can see your face now 
 I can feel your grace now

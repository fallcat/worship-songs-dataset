I've got this story in my heart 
 And its become my song 
 And I can't help but sing 
 The cynics and the saints 
 The famous and unnamed 
 One day we will all fall before You 
 But I'm gonna bow today 
 Jesus, You are so wnderful 
 I cannot live without Your love 
 Jesus, You are so glorious 
 No one can move me like You do 
 I love being loved by You 
 I love being loved by You 
 So take me deeper still 
 Where Your mysteries are revealed 
 And I see You as You are 
 Oh, show me how to die 
 Till all that's left of me 
 Is a mirror of everything You are 
 And I come before You complete 
 Who am I that You would notice me? 
 Who am I that You would think of me? 
 I stand in awe of Your amazing love 
 Who am I that You would rescue me? 
 Who am I that You would die?

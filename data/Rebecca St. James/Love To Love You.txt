So many things I wish to say to You 
 Hard as I try - words cannot explain 
 So I, lift my eyes and lift my hands 
 In awe of You, adoring you 
 And I want to say that I love you... 
 Oh how I love to love You 
 Oh how I love to love You 
 I love to love You... 
 So many things I wish to thank You for 
 Hard as I try, words cannot express my gratitude 
 So I, lift my heart and lift my soul 
 In awe of You, I worship You 
 And I want to say that I love You 
 I want to say that I need You... 
 Oh how I love to love You 
 Oh how I love to love You 
 'Cause I love 
 I love You Lord 
 I reach, I wait, I run, I praise 
 I love You 
 I am like the willow 
 Living by the streams 
 I drink of Your river 
 I praise You for Your love 
 I praise You for this peace 
 My Lord, My Love, My Life-giver 
 Oh how I love to love You 
 Oh how I love to love You 
 I wait (I love to love You) 
 I wait for You (I love to love You) 
 I reach, I reach for You (I love to love You) 
 'Cause I love 
 I love You Lord 
 I reach, I wait, I run, I praise 
 I love You 
 I love to love You (4 times)

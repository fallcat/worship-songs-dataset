Like a band without a drummer 
 That's me without you 
 Like a year without a summer 
 That's me without you 
 Like a king without a country 
 Like a room without a view 
 Like an empty gun 
 Like a fatherless son 
 That's me without you 
 Like a ship without a rudder 
 That's me without you 
 Like a child without its mother 
 That's me without you 
 Like a story with no ending 
 Like a foot without a shoe 
 Like a wasted feast 
 Like a faithless priest 
 That's me without you 
 Me without you 
 A pitiful sight 
 Me without you 
 It ain't never gonna feel right 
 Like a war without an enemy 
 That's me without you 
 A disease without a remedy 
 That's me without you 
 Like a crime without a victim 
 Like a sleuth without a clue 
 Like an empty gun 
 Like a fatherless son 
 That's me without you 
 Without you...

Merciful God 
 We confess 
 That we have sinned against You 
 Merciful God 
 We confess 
 That we have not loved You with our whole heart 
 In what we have done and left undone 
 In what we have done and left undone 
 We will lay down 
 We humbly repent 
 And we cry out for You God 
 Have mercy on us Merciful God 
 Forgive us now 
 That we may delight in Your will 
 And walk in Your ways 
 And lift high Your name 
 And walk in Your ways 
 And lift high Your name 
 We will lay down 
 We humbly repent 
 And we cry out for You God 
 Have mercy on us

May the words of my mouth please you 
 Dear God 
 May the thoughts of my heart say to you 
 All that I desire is to be with you forever 
 Lord I pray - I pray that You 
 Take me - Make me 
 Beautiful to You 
 Create me so - I mirror You 
 Take me - Make me 
 An image of You 
 Lord I want to mirror You 
 Let the words of my mouth please You 
 Dear God 
 May the thoughts of my heart be as Yours 
 Cause all that I desire is to be here with 
 You forever 
 Lord I pray - I pray that you 
 Take me - Make me 
 Beautiful to You 
 Create me so - I mirror You 
 Take me - Make me 
 An image of You 
 Lord I want to mirror You 
 Break me out of my complacency 
 Breathe Your breath of life into my soul 
 Into my soul 
 May the words of my mouth please You 
 Take me - Make me 
 Beautiful to You 
 Create me so - I mirror You 
 Take me - Make me 
 An image of You 
 Cause Lord I want to mirror You

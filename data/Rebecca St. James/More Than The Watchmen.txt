Out of the depths of my despair 
 Oh I cry Father hear my voice 
 Open Your ears to hear my mercy cry 
 And if You kept a book of sin 
 Oh Father, who'd be standing? 
 But in Your goodness there is mercy and forgiveness 
 More than the watchmen wait for morning 
 My soul it waits for You 
 More than the watchmen wait for morning 
 More than the watchmen wait for morning 
 My soul it waits for You 
 More than the watchmen wait for morning

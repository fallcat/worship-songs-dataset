When the weight of the world is on my shoulders 
 And my bridges are broken 
 I will remember You 
 When the flowers are blooming 
 Skies are bluer than ever 
 And everything's well 
 I will remember You 
 Oh Lord my God 
 You walk beside me 
 Through my laughter through the tears 
 Oh Lord my God 
 You hold and You hide me 
 Because of Your love 
 I have nothing to fear 
 You are my hope 
 You are my joy 
 You are my Savior and You are my God 
 You are my love 
 You are my life 
 And I will praise you forever my God Now the deepest part of me is crying out 
 Just to know You more 
 So I remember You 
 And as I draw nearer to who You are 
 I see You clearer 
 As I remember You 
 Oh Lord my God 
 You walk beside me 
 All through my laughter and through my tears 
 Oh Lord my God, You hold and You hide me 
 Because of Your love 
 I have nothing to fear 
 You are my hope You are my joy 
 You are my Savior and You are my God 
 You are my love 
 You are my life 
 And I will praise You forever my God

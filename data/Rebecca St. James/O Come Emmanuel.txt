O come, O come, Emmanuel, 
 And ransom captive Israel, 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the Son of God appear. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice!  Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O Israel! 
 Shall come 
 O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by thine advent here; 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night, 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice!  Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 O Israel 
 Shall Come 
 Shall Come 
 Shall Come 
 Shall Come 
 Shall Come 
 Shall Come 
 Come to thee my Friend 
 Come, thou Wisdom from on high, 
 And order all things, far and nigh; 
 To us the path of knowledge show, 
 And cause us in her ways to go. 
 Rejoice! Rejoice!  Emanuel 
 Shall come to thee, O Israel! 
 Rejoice, Rejoice Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee O Israel 
 O Israel 
 Shall Come 
 O Come O Come Emmanuel - come 
 O Come O Come Emmanuel - come 
 O Come O Come Emmanuel - come 
 O Come O Come Emmanuel - come

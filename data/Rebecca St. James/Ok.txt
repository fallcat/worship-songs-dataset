Inwardly I, 
 See Your smile 
 And I reach for, I reach for it 
 'Cause I know it's all gonna be okay 
 Okay... 
 It's all gonna be okay, okay, O.K. 
 That is why I always say 
 It's all gonna be O.K. 
 I want to, 
 Cover You with presents 
 But my love is all I have 
 So take me, take me now 
 'Cause I know You'll not abandon me 
 You will complete what's begun in me 
 It's all gonna be okay, okay, O.K. 
 That is why I always say 
 It's all gonna be okay now 
 It's all gonna be O.K. 
 As I, 
 Come closer now 
 Hold me 
 And wipe away my tears 
 Hold me... Oh 
 It's all gonna be okay, okay, O.K. 
 That is why I always say 
 It's all gonna be okay, okay, O.K. 
 That is why I always say 
 It's O.K.

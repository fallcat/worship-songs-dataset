The amazing grace of the Master, Jesus Christ 
 The extravagant love of God 
 The intimate friendship of the Holy Spirit 
 Be with you 
 May the grace of our Lord be with you 
 Now and always may you stay 
 Blameless till He comes 
 May the love of our Lord be with you 
 Now and always may you stay 
 Blameless till He comes 
 May our Lord, Jesus Christ Himself 
 Encourage and strengthen you 
 In every good thing you do and say 
 God loved us, and through His grace 
 He gave us shining hope and 
 Encouragement that continues forever 
 Love mixed with faith be yours 
 From God the Father and from the Master 
 Jesus Christ 
 And now unto Him 
 Who is able to keep us from falling 
 And present you faultless 
 Before the presence of His glory 
 With exceeding joy 
 To the only wise God, our Savior 
 Be glory and majesty 
 Dominion and power 
 Both now and forever ... 
 Amen.

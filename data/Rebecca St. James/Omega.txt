The amazing grace of the Master

 The extravagant love of God, 
 The intimate friendship of the Holy Spirit, 
 Be with you 
 May the grace of our Lord/ Be with you 
 Now and always may you stay 
 Blameless till He comes 
 May the love of our Lord/ Be with you 
 Now and always may you stay 
 Blameless till He comes 
 May our Lord 
 Jesus Christ Himself 
 Encourage and strengthen you 
 In every good thing you do and say 
 God loved us 
 And through His grace 
 He gave us shining hope 
 And encouragement 
 That continues forever 
 May the grace of our Lord/ Be with you

 Now and always may you stay 
 Blameless till He comes 
 Love mixed with faith be yours 
 From God the Father 
 And from the Master

 And now unto Him 
 Who is able to you from falling 
 And present you faultless before 
 The presence of His glory 
 With exceeding joy 
 To the only wise God, Our Saviour 
 Be glory and majesty 
 Dominion and power 
 Both now and forever... Amen! 
 May the grace of our Lord/ Be with you 
 Now and always may you stay 
 Blameless till He comes 
 May the love of our Lord/ Be with you 
 Now and always may you stay 
 Blameless till He comes

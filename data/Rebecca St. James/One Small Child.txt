One small child in a land of a thousand 
 One small dream of a Savior tonight 
 One small hand reaching out to the starlight 
 One small Savior of love 
 One small Savior of love 
 One King bringing his gold and his riches 
 One King Ruling an army of might 
 One King kneeling with incense and candlelight 
 One King bringing us life 
 One King bringing us life 
 See the shepherd's kneeling before Him 
 See the King's on bended knee 
 See the mother praising the Father 
 See His tiny eyelids fall 
 One small child in a land of a thousand 
 One small dream of a Savior tonight 
 One small hand reaching out to the starlight 
 One small Savior of life 
 One small Savior of life 
 See the shepherds kneeling before Him 
 See the King's  on bended knee 
 See the mother praising the Father 
 See His tiny eyelids fall 
 See the shepherd's kneeling before Him 
 See the King's on bended knee 
 See His mother praising His Father 
 See His tiny eyelids fall 
 See the shepherds kneeling before Him 
 See the King's on bended knee 
 See the mother praising the Father 
 See His tiny eyelids fall 
 See the Shepherds kneeling before Him 
 See the King's on bended knee 
 See His mother praising His Father 
 See His tiny eyelids fall 
 See the shepherds 
 See the Kings 
 See His mother 
 See His tiny eyelids fall.

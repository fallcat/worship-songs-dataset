Tell me can I get a witness here 
 Listen up while the music's pumpin' 
 Come on everybody gather 'round 
 Tell me what He's done in your life 
 If you wanna make a difference here 
 If you're ready to believe in something 
 Then let me hear you say "Oh" 
 We know He'll be with us wherever we go 
 And we're standing here as one I know 
 We come together 
 To lift His praises tonight 
 And when we do 
 You know we're doing right 
 Don't make no difference 
 Where we're coming from 
 We believe in the Son 
 And that's what makes us one 
 Let me tell you it's a brand new day 
 Every color every nation 
 Old things are passed away 
 It's just a freedom you know 
 You can feel it in a whole new way 
 If He's making you a new creation 
 Then let me hear you say "Oh" 
 What we share is a bond that nobody can break 
 No they can't take that away I know We come together 
 To lift His praises tonight 
 And when we do 
 You know we're doing right 
 Don't make no difference 
 Where we're coming form 
 We believe in the Son 
 And that's what makes us one 
 We are one in the Spirit 
 We are one in the Lord 
 We are one in the Spirit 
 One in the Lord 
 We are one in the Spirit 
 We are one in the Lord 
 We believe in the Father 
 We believe in the Son 
 And that's what makes us one 
 We come together 
 To lift His praises tonight 
 And when we do 
 You know we're doing right 
 Don't make no difference 
 Where we're coming form 
 We believe in the Son 
 And that's what makes us one

Alone in the valley 
 I cry for You 
 To fill me with Your peace 
 So when the lightning strikes 
 Thunder roars around me 
 Still I live in peace 
 You ask that I 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Be still and know You are God 
 When the fires rage 
 When the storms surround me 
 Still I live in peace 
 Though the mountains fall 
 Crash into the ocean 
 Still I live in peace 
 You ask that I 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Lead me through the valley 
 Lead me by the streams 
 Restore me and draw me to You, God 
 To You I lift my soul 
 To You who makes me whole 
 Gently You hold me close to You 
 Close to You 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Be still and know You are God 
 Be still and know You are God 
 You're near me 
 You love me 
 You hold me 
 You reach me 
 You still me 
 You move me 
 You draw me to You, God 
 (Repeat) 
 You are God!

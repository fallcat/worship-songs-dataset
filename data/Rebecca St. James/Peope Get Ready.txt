Lord I'm ready now, 
 I'm waiting for your triumphant return. 
 Your coming soon. 
 This world has nothing for me, I find my peace and joy solely in you. 
 (Only in you) 
 I want the world to see, your alive and living well in me. 
 Let me be apart of the harvest, for the days are few. 
 Your coming soon. 
 So people get ready, Jesus is coming. 
 Soon we'll be going home. 
 People get ready, Jesus is coming to take from the world his own. 
 Peple get ready, Jesus is coming. 
 Soon we'll be going home. 
 People get ready, Jesus is coming. 
 Soon we'll be going home. 
 (We'll be going home.) 
 There's a day that comes, 
 When we will be divided right and left... 
 For those who know him (those who do not know) 
 Those who know him well will meet him in the air HALeLUja! 
 God is with us! 
 Those who do not know... 
 They will hear, "Depart... I know you not." 
 For all my friends, you see... 
 There will be a day when we'll be counted... 
 So know him well... Know him well! 
 To take his own (to take his own) 
 To take his own (to take his own) 
 We'll be going home (We'll be going home) 
 We'll be going home (We'll be going home) 
 We'll be going home! 
 For my friends, you see 
 There will be a day when we'll be counted. 
 So know him well, Know him well! 
 People get ready!

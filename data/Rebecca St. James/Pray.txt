Jesus I am broken now 
 Before You I fall I lay me down 
 All I want is You, my all 
 I cry out from the ashes 
 Burned with sin and shame 
 I ask You Lord to make me whole again 
 For You say if I will come and will 
 Pray to You 
 There's forgiveness when I 
 Turn from me and pray 
 For You say if I will come and will 
 Pray to You 
 You hear me and heal me when I pray 
 Your ways are not my own 
 But I long for them to be 
 So this is what I pray 
 One with You You'll make me 
 Melt me away, 'til only You remain 
 For You say if I will come and will 
 Pray to You 
 There's forgiveness when I 
 Turn to You and pray 
 For You say if I will come and will 
 Pray to You 
 You hear me and heal me when I pray 
 Jesus I am broken now before You 
 Take me I am yours 
 For You say if I will come and will 
 Pray to You 
 There's forgiveness when I 
 Turn from me and pray 
 For You say if I will come and will 
 Pray to You 
 You hear me and heal me when I pray 
 For You say if I will come and will 
 Pray to You 
 There's forgiveness when I 
 Turn to You and pray 
 Pray to You 
 You hear me and heal me when I pray 
 When I pray (5 times)

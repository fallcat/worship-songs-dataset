Come to me all who are weary 
 And I will give you rest 
 Come to me all who are weary 
 And I will give you rest 
 Lay you head down 
 On my shoulders 
 Be still my child 
 Rest a while 
 And I'll quiet you with My love 
 Rejoice over You 
 With My song 
 With My song 
 And I'll quiet you with My love 
 Rejoice over You 
 With My song 
 With My song 
 Come to me all who are weary 
 And take My yoke upon you 
 Come to me all who are weary 
 My burden is easy and light 
 Lay you head down 
 On my shoulders 
 Be still my child 
 Rest a while 
 {Musical Bridge} 
 And I'll quiet you with My love

If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 There's someone in my life 
 A peace I can't describe 
 For I've been reborn 
 If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 I've found a whole new life 
 And hope that I can't hide 
 For I've been reborn 
 Have you ever felt 
 A longing, a searching within your soul 
 Soul for something more 
 But you don't know what for 
 There's one who will reach across the distance 
 From the Heavens to the earth, the earth 
 Because He loves you 
 He loves you 
 If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 There's someone in my life 
 A peace I can't describe 
 For I've been reborn 
 If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 I've found a whole new life 
 And hope that I can't hide 
 For I've been reborn 
 If you see a change in me 
 If you see a change in me 
 If you see a change in me 
 If you see a change in me 
 One, two, three, four 
 Have you ever felt that something, thing's missing 
 Within your soul, your soul 
 You want something more 
 But you don't know what for 
 There is only one you need, need 
 But you've got to believe, believe 
 That He loves you 
 Enough to give His life 
 If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 There's someone in my life 
 A peace I can't describe 
 For I've been reborn 
 If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 I've found a whole new life 
 And hope that I can't hide 
 For I've been reborn 
 If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 There's someone in my life 
 A peace I can't describe 
 For I've been reborn 
 If you see a change in me, don't wonder 
 I've found a whole new life 
 And hope that I can't hide 
 For I've been reborn

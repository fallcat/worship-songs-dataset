Words and Music by Geoff Bullock 
 Refresh my heart, Lord, 
 Renew my love, 
 Pour Your Spirit into my soul, 
 Refresh my heart. 
 You set me apart, Lord, 
 To make me new, 
 By Your Spirit, 
 Lift me up, Lord, 
 Refresh my heart. 
 And I will worship You, Lord, 
 With all of my heart, 
 And I will follow You, Lord, 
 Refresh my heart. 
 Refresh my heart, Lord, 
 Renew my love, 
 Pour Your Spirit into my soul, 
 Refresh my heart. 
 You set me apart, Lord, 
 To make me new, 
 By Your Spirit, 
 Lift me up, oh Lord, 
 Refresh my heart. 
 And I will worship you, Lord, 
 With all of my heart, 
 And I will follow You, Lord, 
 Refresh my heart. 
 And I will worship you, Lord, 
 With all of my heart, 
 And I will follow You, Lord, 
 Refresh my heart. 
 Refresh my heart. 
 Refresh my heart. 
 Refresh my heart.

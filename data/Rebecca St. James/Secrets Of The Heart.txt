Jn 4.1-26 
 Spanish Harlem - Public Fountain 
 How did he know all that? 
 Maggie: 
 Pardon me, mister, I don't think I know you 
 I've never seen you around 
 Can I give you comfort - I'll tell of your future 
 They say I'm the best deal in town 
 Hero: 
 Oh, no thank you, Maggie - Yeah I know your name 
 And I also know your comfort never lasts 
 You drink from a well of a lost lover's passion 
 But then you're just thirsty again 
 Come take a taste now of God's lasting water 
 That comforts your thirst within 
 Maggie: 
 Hey, how do you know that I'm thirsty at all 
 I've never been with you but you know my name 
 I almost feel like you know me too well 
 Somehow that makes me afraid 
 So I ask, how do you know secrets of my heart? 
 Has my life been written in the stars? 
 And can you tell me all I've ever done - all I've ever done? 
 Secrets of the heart? 
 Hero: 
 Oh, girl you've runaway to this dark city? 
 To leave your ugly past behind 
 A father that used you and a mother refused you 
 Don't think that no one saw you cry 
 Maggie: 
 Oh, stranger who are you to know all my pain 
 I've only cried alone in the torture of the night 
 Are you a player? Just tell me the truth 
 Did you come to help me? 
 Can I trust you? 
 So I ask, how do you know secrets of my heart? 
 Has my life been written in the stars? 
 And can you tell me all I've ever done - all I've ever done? 
 spoken: 
 Hey, sir... Can you help me? 
 Secrets of my heart 
 Can I believe in you? 
 Hero: 
 Yeah, I can help you. That's why I'm here.

You promised me 
 That You'd never leave 
 Or let me go 
 You promised me 
 That You'd love me through 
 The highs and lows 
 You promised me 
 You won't give me more 
 Than I can hear 
 You promised me 
 That when I cry out 
 That You'd be there 
 The shadowlands are what I know 
 So I'm hanging on to Your every word 
 The shadowlands surround me now 
 But You walk with me through the cloud 
 Into the sun 
 Into the sun 
 You promised me 
 If I sow in tears 
 I'll reap in joy 
 You promised me 
 That You will breathe life 
 Into my soul 
 I know it's true 
 All that You say 
 I believe in You 
 And I am standing on 
 The promises You've made 
 You promiseme and I believe

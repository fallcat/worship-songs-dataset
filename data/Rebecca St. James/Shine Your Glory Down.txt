When I run, lead me 
 When I sleep, keep me 
 When I wake Father speak with me 
 Oh Majesty 
 Light of the world, 
 Light up this day 
 God I long to see your face 
 Oh shine your glory down 
 Light of the world 
 Be on display 
 And every heart will sing your place 
 Oh shine your glory down 
 With each breath fill me 
 With each step free me 
 When I love Father love through me 
 Oh Majesty 
 I do not walk in darkness 
 I will not live in fear 
 I'll walk in Your light

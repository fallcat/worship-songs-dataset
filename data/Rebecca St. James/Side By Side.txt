Side by side by side by side 
 Walking together is the way it should be 
 Side by side by side by side 
 When you're needing somebody 
 Depend upon me 
 We'll travel on this journey of life 
 Side by side 
 (Repeat) 
 Everyday of my life, every valley I face 
 I know you'll always be there every step that I take 
 Let's keep our eyes on the father above 
 I need you, you need me, we need love 
 Side by side by side by side 
 Walking together is the way it should be 
 Side by side by side by side 
 When you're needing somebody 
 Depend upon me 
 We'll travel on this journey of life 
 Side by side 
 No need to go by yourself find the way on your own 
 You're never out of his sight even when you're alone 
 All I'll stay closer then a brother to you 
 Arm in arm, hand in hand, two by two 
 Side by side by side by side 
 Walking together is the way it should be 
 Side by side by side by side 
 When you're needing somebody 
 Depend upon me 
 We'll travel on this journey of life 
 Side by side 
 (Repeat 2X)

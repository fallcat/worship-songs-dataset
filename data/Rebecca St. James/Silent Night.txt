Sleep in heavenly peace 
 Sleep in heavenly peace 
 Christ the Savior is born 
 Christ the Savior is born 
 Silent night, holy night, 
 Son of God, 
 Love's pure light 
 Radiant beams from Thy holy face 
 With the dawn of redeeming grace, 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth, 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth. 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth, 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.

The Enemy's Defeated 
 The enemy's defeated, 
 The battle is the Lord's 
 The righteous are forgiven 
 The victory is yours. 
 O the fire is spreading, 
 The glory of the Lord 
 The enemy's defeated 
 The victory is yours. 
 Fire of Gold falling from above 
 Holy f 
 Ire burning in our hearts 
 Fire of love spreading from within 
 I'm on fire and the fire is spreading fast

 I Am Not Ashamed 
 I am not ashamed 
 Of the G 
 Ospel of His name 
 For it is the power, 
 The power of my salvation 
 I am not ashamed, no way, 
 Of the Gospel of His kingdom 
 I have been delivered, Jesus set me free! 
 I'm saved, S.A.V.E.D. 
 I'm saved, Jesus set me free!

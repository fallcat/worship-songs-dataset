There is a time for healing 
 There's a time for all purposes under the sun 
 There's a time for laughter 
 There's a time to let go and a time to hold on 
 So we are here, but why are we waiting 
 Why are we acting like dead men walking 
 The time has arrived for us to arise 
 Joining our hands, united together 
 This is our time to be strong 
 This is our time to rise up 
 To stand and be counted 
 This is our time to believe 
 To know in our God we are free 
 Let the world know to Him we belong 
 Lord capture our hearts now 
 Drown out the pleasures and treasures that bind us 
 Give us Your courage 
 To be strong to be brave 
 And to never back down 
 There's no time to lose 
 We can't be silent 
 In a world that is dying to find out the truth 
 We've got the hope 
 We've got the answer 
 Let's lay down our all 
 With reckless abandon 
 This is our time to be strong 
 This is our time to rise up 
 To stand and be counted 
 This is our time to believe 
 To know in our God we are free 
 Let the world know to Him we belong

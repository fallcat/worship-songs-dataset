Sweet little Jesus boy, they made You be born in a manger 
 Sweet little Holy child, 
 We didn't know who You were. 
 Sweet little Jesus boy, they made You be born in a manger 
 Sweet little Holy child, 
 We didn't know who You were. 
 We didn't know who You were. 
 Didn't know You'd come to save us: 
 To take our sins away. 
 Our eyes were blind we could not see - 
 We didn't know who You were, 
 We didn't know who You were. 
 Long time ago You were born, 
 Born in a manger sweet little Jesus boy, 
 The world treats You mean Lord, treats me me too, 
 But that's how things are done here: 
 We don't know who You are, 
 We don't know who You are 
 Who You are 
 Who You are 
 Who You are 
 You have told us how, we are trying, 
 Master You have shown us how even when You were dying, 
 Just seems like we can't do right, look how we treated You, 
 But please Sir, forgive us Lord 
 We didn't know it was You, 
 We didn't know it was You 
 It was You 
 It was You 
 It was You 
 Sweet little Jesus boy born a long time ago 
 Sweet little Holy Child, 
 We didn't know who You were

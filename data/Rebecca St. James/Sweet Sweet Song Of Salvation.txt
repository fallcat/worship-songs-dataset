When you know a pretty story you don't let it go unsaid, 
 You tell it to your children as you tuck them in the bed. 
 When you know all of a secret you tell it to your friends, 
 You tell'em that a lifetime filled with happiness is like a street that never ends. 
 Singing that (sweet) song of salvation, 
 Let the laughter fill the air. 
 Sing that sweet (sweet) song of salvation, 
 Tell the people everywhere. 
 Sing that sweet (sweet) song of salvation, 
 To every man and every nation. 
 Sing that sweet (sweet) song of salvation, 
 And let the people know that Jesus cares. 
 Look around you as you sing it, there are people everywhere. 
 And to those who stop to listen that seet song becomes a prayer. 
 'Cause when you know a wonderful secret, you tell it to your friends. 
 You tell 'em that a lifetime filled with Jesus is like a street that never ends.

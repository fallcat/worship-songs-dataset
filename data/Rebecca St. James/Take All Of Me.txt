And I love You 
 All of my hope is in You 
 Jesus Christ, take my life 
 Take all of me, yeah 
 All of me 
 You broke the night like the sun 
 Healed my heart with Your great love 
 And any trouble I couldn't bear 
 You lifted me upon Your shoulders 
 Love that's stronger 
 Love that covers sin 
 And takes the weight of the world 
 You stand on mountain tops with me 
 With You I walk through the valleys 
 You gave Your only Son for me 
 Your grace is all I rely on 
 Love that's stronger 
 Love that covers sin 
 And takes the weight of the world 
 And I love You so 
 And I give up my heart to say 
 I need You so 
 My everything, O Lord 
 I love You so

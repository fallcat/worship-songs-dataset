I am caught in the middle of 
 So much that I cannot see the forest for the trees 
 And oh I feel the pressure now 
 And I'm about to blow, it's all caving in on me 
 Something I know is amiss in my soul 
 My eyes are on me 
 They should not be 
 I'll praise You from the center of the fire 
 So I say... 
 Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You 
 I've got two words for You 
 Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You 
 From my heart 
 Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You 
 I've got three words more than thank You 
 I love You 
 I've got much to thank You for 
 You opened up the door 
 Turned my sorrow to joy 
 In this world that I am in 
 Your wonders never end 
 You define hope 
 Thinking of all that You have in store for me 
 I am in awe, I have got to stop 
 And thank You for the love I have found in You 
 I want to say thank You for the peace 
 That I have found with Your love surrounding me 
 I want to say thank You for the mercy 
 You've shown me the way that You've grown me 
 I want to say thank You for the bride 
 That You gave and all of our babies 
 I want to say thank You just for being You 
 'Cause You are the mystery that put a fix on me 
 I am just some dude with a checkered little history 
 Deep in the eye of my hurricane 
 But You are the blood pumping through my veins

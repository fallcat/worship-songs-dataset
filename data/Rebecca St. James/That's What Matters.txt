I read about this guy once 
 He seemed to own the earth 
 As far as big shots go and people in the know... well 
 He was definitely top of the list 
 Anything he wanted - he'd get it 
 Society's dream 
 Had lots of stuff - had lots of money 
 But you know what's funny? 
 He said it all was useless 
 Meaningless - Meaningless 
 He said "Everything is meaningless... 
 A chase after the wind" 
 Don't wish for a better day 
 Be glad and use the one you're in 
 Fear God and do exactly what He says 
 That's what matters 
 All else fades like the flowers 
 Well, he'd tried pleasure 
 There was nothing in that 
 He built houses and gardens and parks 
 What good did it do? 
 Just got him more depressed 
 Meaningless - Meaningless 
 He said "Everything is meaningless... 
 But this is what I learned in all my years" 
 Meaningless - Meaningless 
 He said "Everything is meaningless... 
 A chase after the wind" 
 Don't wish for a better day 
 Be glad and use the one you're in 
 Fear God and do exactly what He says 
 That's what matters 
 All else fades away 
 Meaningful - Meaningful 
 Life holds new meaning 
 When God becomes the center of it all 
 I read about another man once 
 He came to save the earth 
 You know I got to meet Him, Jesus 
 He revolutionized my whole entire life

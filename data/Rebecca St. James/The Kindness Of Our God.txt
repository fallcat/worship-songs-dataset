He spoke a word and there was light 
 He split the sea and sky apart 
 And with a breath created life 
 This is the power of our God 
 The One who tells the sun to rise 
 And holds the keys of death and life 
 He sees our tears and dries our eyes 
 This is the kindness of our God 
 The angels sang a song of peace 
 For unto us a child was born 
 And with Him came the earth's release 
 This is the mercy of our God 
 We drove the nails into the cross 
 He took the weight of sin for us 
 Because of love He paid the cost 
 This is the kindness of our God 
 Now here before us lies today 
 With every breath we make a choice 
 To love as He first led the way 
 This is the calling of our God 
 And when the final race is won 
 And we are under Heaven's sun 
 We rejoice to hear Him say, "Well done" 
 This is the kindness of our God 
 The angels sing and we'll adore 
 The One who sits upon the throne 
 We will live with Him forevermore 
 This is the kindness of our God 
 This is the kindness of our God

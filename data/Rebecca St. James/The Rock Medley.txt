 God didn't give me a spirit of fear, 
 But He gave me a spirit of power.

 But He gave me a spirit of power. 
 To fight the enemy, 
 Set the captives free, 
 So I can live in victory. 
 I'll stand to fight, 
 With all God's might, 
 Now turning darkness into light.

 As the hour of the Lord draws near, 
 Get ready to meet the King, 
 He's coming in the clouds of heaven, 
 He's coming back again, 
 With a shout He will descend, 
 In power and glory, 
 As the coming of the Lord draws near, 
 Get ready to meet the King, 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 As they meet Him in the air, 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 Jesus Christ is coming back again. 
 As the hour of the Lord draws near, 
 Get ready to meet the King,

 In power and glory, 
 As the coming of the Lord draws near, 
 Get ready to meet the King, 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 As they meet Him in the air 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 Jesus Christ is coming back again. 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 As they meet Him in the air, 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 Jesus Christ is coming back again. 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 As they meet Him in the air, 
 And the saints shout, "Amen!" 
 Jesus Christ is coming back again. 
 Jesus Christ is coming back again. 
 Jesus Christ is coming back again.

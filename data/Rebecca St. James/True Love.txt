True love, talking 'bout true love 
 Gotta have real (God's) love 
 Whatcha gonna do? 
 True love 
 Love don't hate, love don't play those games with your mind 
 Love forgives and true love lives forever and all time 
 I'll never treat you like a stranger, turn my back in times of danger 
 Love don't act that way, I said love don't act that way 
 Love is patient, love is kind, love won't let you down 
 It won't deceive, love will never keep the past around 
 Never worries, never lies, no, it never leaves you, never dies 
 Love don't act that way, I said love don't act that way

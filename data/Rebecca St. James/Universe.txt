Universe 
 Like the river that runs to the sea 
 The sky it speaks of Your love for me 
 It's wider than I can imagine 
 And don't have to ever be afraid 
 Nothing in the universe could take this love away 
 If I were to fly on the wings of the sunrise 
 Settle on the farthest side of the sea 
 If I go up to the heavens 
 You are there 
 If I make my bed in the depths 
 You are there 
 If I were to count every thought that You think of me 
 They would be more than the sand on the shore 
 When I'm awake You see what I'm thinking 
 And when I'm asleep You're watching 
 Like the river that runs to the sea 
 The oceans speak of Your love for me 
 It's deeper than I can imagine 
 Higher than the sky is your love for me 
 Like the river that runs to the sea 
 The sky it speaks of Your love for me 
 It's wider than I can imagine 
 And I don't have to ever be afraid 
 Nothing in the universe could take this love away 
 If I were to walk through the deepest valley 
 If I were to hide my face in shame 
 Even there You see what I'm thinking 
 I can't get away from You 
 If I were to fly 
 If I were to go up 
 If I were to ride 
 On the wings of the dawn 
 If I were to run 
 If I were to hide 
 Even there You know my heart 
 Lord You know my mind 
 Could take this love away 3x 
 Like the river 
 Like the river that runs to the sea 
 Nothing in the universe could take this love away 2x

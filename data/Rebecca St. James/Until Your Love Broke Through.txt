Like a dreamer that was trying to build 
 A highway to the sky 
 All my hopes would come tumblin' down 
 And I never knew just why 
 Until today when You 
 Pulled away the clouds 
 That hung like curtains on my eyes. 
 I was blind all these wasted years when 
 I thought I was so wise. 
 But then You took me by surprise. 
 Like waking up from the longest dream 
 How real it seemed 
 Until Your love broke through 
 And I was lost in a fantasy 
 That blinded me 
 Until Your love broke through. 
 All my life I have been searching 
 For that carzy missing part 
 With one touch You just rolled away 
 The stone that held my heart, 
 Now I see that the answer was as simple 
 As my need to let love in 
 And I am so sure I could never doubt 
 Your gentle touch again 
 It's like the power of the wind.

I walked for you in the wind 
 I called for you when the earth is shaken 
 Speak to me in the whisper 
 You'll always see beyond my world 
 Open my eyes give me vision to see you 
 Lord become us and 
 Let me know you 
 For I long to see you as you are (Vision to see you) 
 Open my ears let me hear you 
 Open my heart - show me Father 
 For I long to see you as you are 
 Give me vision to see you 
 I walked for you in the fire 
 I looked to you and my will is broken 
 Speak to me in the silence 
 You'll always see the truth unveiled 
 Greet with mansions (dove noises) 
 Filled with all your glory (dove noises) 
 All night you show me when you be with Son of Man 
 So when I see the storm is falling I will stand, arise 
 Open my eyes give me vision to see you 
 Lord become and 
 Let me know you 
 For I long to see you as you are (Vision to see you) 
 Open my ears let me know you...

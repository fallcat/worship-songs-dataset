I walk along this winding road 
 Too many voices tell me which way to go 
 Sometimes this heart gets so confused 
 I need you Lord to show me 
 Which path to choose 
 I'm longing for that place way up high 
 Where God's air is sweet and I touch the Sky 
 Way up here I can see the far horizon 
 All the world before my eyes is clear to see 
 Way up here where my Father always meets me 
 On this mountain where He heals me 
 I can rest, way up here 
 Rising above the life we know 
 Leaving the streams of sorrow far down below 
 I feel the touch of God's loving hands 
 Restoring me in ways I can't understand 
 If I fall away, His love reaches me 
 And He brings me back to the edge of my dreams 
 No matter where we travel, no need to fear the shadows 
 My God is there 
 His light is there to follow, back to the quiet waters 
 I know He cares

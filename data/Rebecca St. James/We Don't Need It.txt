You can have the money, wheel it, deal it, win it all 
 You can have all of the fashoin, you can even own the mall 
 You can change your face into the person of your dreams 
 Trim your nose and dye your hair and change your eyes from blue to green 
 You can be a model, cover every magazine 
 You can walk on every stage or be the host of M.TV 
 You can win all the medals, run it, swim it perfectly 
 You could have a turn at Indy, you could even own the team 
 We're never gonna see God if we keep looking for vogue 
 We could gain the whole world but still be losin' our soul 
 We don't need it, cause God has given us our needs 
 We don't want it, shouldn't He be our priority 
 We don't need it, Jesus said to leave it all behind 
 Let's keep our eyes on things above cause 
 We don't need to want to need it 
 You can get a job on Wall Street, have more money than you've seen 
 You can buy administrations and you can even own the queen 
 You can own a castle, oily paintings on the wall 
 Build a suite for every pleasure, have a disco, host a ball 
 Drive a Lamburguini, fast as time and painted red 
 Leather phone and matching fax and color TVs overhead 
 Take your yacht to Rio, fly your jet up to Cancun 
 Screamin' down the highway like a rocket to the moon

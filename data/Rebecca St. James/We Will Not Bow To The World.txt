Words and Music by Geoff Bullock and Brian Houston 
 We will not bow to the world, 
 We will bow down to the Lord, 
 Take up the fight, take up the armor, 
 We'll take up the sword, 
 We'll stand with Him. 
 We'll fight on the beaches, 
 We'll fight on the streets, 
 Invincible. 
 Take up the challenge, 
 He is calling, 
 Stand up together, 
 He is calling, 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow to the world. 
 We will not bow to the world, 
 We will bow down to the Lord, 
 Take up the fight, take up the armor, 
 We'll take up the sword, 
 We'll stand with Him. 
 We'll fight on the beaches, 
 We'll fight on the streets, 
 Invincible. 
 Take up the challenge, 
 He is calling, 
 Stand up together, 
 He is calling 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow to the world. 
 Take up the challenge, 
 He is calling, 
 Stand up together, 
 He is calling 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow to the world. 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow down, no 
 We will not bow to the world. 
 We won't bow down.

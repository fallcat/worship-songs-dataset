When the stars burn down and the earth wears out 
 And we stand before the throne 
 With the witnesses who have gone before 
 We will rise and all applaud 
 Singing blessing and honor, glory and power 
 Forever to our god 
 Singing blessing and honor, glory and power 
 Forever to our god 
 When the hands of time wind fully down 
 And the earth is rolled up like a scroll 
 The trumpets will call and the world will fall 
 To its knees as we all go home 
 Star of the morning, light of salvation 
 Majesty 
 God of all mysteries, lord of the universe 
 Righteous king 
 There will come a day standing face to face 
 In a moment, we will be like him 
 He will wipe our eyes dry, take us up to his side 
 And forever we will be his

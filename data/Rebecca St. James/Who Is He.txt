Words and Music by Chris Pringle 
 Who is He, 
 Who rides like the sun, 
 There's nothing He cannot do. 
 Who is He, 
 That sits on the throne, 
 There's nothing He cannot do. 
 There is nothing, nothing, nothing, He cannot do, 
 There is nothing, nothing, nothing, He cannot do. 
 Who is He, 
 Who laughs in glory, 
 There's nothing He cannot do. 
 In days to come, 
 You'll hear my story, 
 There's nothing he cannot do, 
 And there is nothing, nothing, nothing He cannot do, 
 And there is nothing, nothing, nothing He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do. 
 Who is He, 
 Who rides like the sun, 
 There's nothing He cannot do. 
 Who is He, 
 That sits on the throne, 
 There's nothing He cannot do. 
 There is nothing, nothing, nothing, He cannot do, 
 There is nothing, nothing, nothing, He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do. 
 And there is nothing, nothing, nothing He cannot do, 
 There is nothing, nothing, nothing He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do. 
 Nothing, whoa, nothing, whoa, 
 Nothing, whoa, He cannot do.

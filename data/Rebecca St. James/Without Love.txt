T's crawling deep inside 
 Something's just is not right 
 I saw that in your eyes 
 The end of the beginning began 
 When the sky starts to flop 
 You'll find that we have nothing at all 
 I've got some things to tell you 
 'Cause I can't stay this ache 
 Without love, we've got nothing at all 
 Now it's time to change 
 Without love, we've got nothing at all 
 We're falling into a darker grey 
 We're poking through the rain 
 Don't act like everything is okay 
 Can't you see and feel the pain 
 When the future becomes the past 
 You will see that it is never gonna last 
 I've got some things to tell you 
 You cause love 
 What you don't know now 
 What you don't know 
 You don't will 
 And still I miss it 
 Do you want seal it 
 As you can't see 
 You're lost and I'm lost 
 With us 
 Take your best shot at me 
 Without love, we've got nothing at all

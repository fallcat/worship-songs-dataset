Yes, I believe in god 
 Whatever the cost 
 From this day on ' until forever 
 I will take the narrow road 
 For I am not alone 
 I do not walk this path alone 
 Yes, I believe in God 
 This I will say to you 
 Mean it death or mean it life 
 Oh, I believe in God 
 For I have found the way 
 And I am not ashamed 
 I have found the way 
 So through the fire 
 I'll be refined 
 And if that fire 
 Were to take this life 
 I'll be with Him forever 
 I will be with Him forever 
 And I am not ashamed 
 You said 
 "If any man comes after Me 
 He must deny himself, take up his cross 
 And follow after Me" 
 So here I come after You 
 Knowing when my life I lose 
 You give Yours in return 
 You give Your new life in return

We were younger then, you and me, full of dreams, weren't we? 
 I went my way, you went yours, where did you go, dear? 
 Someone said you had left the life we lived together then 
 This is my way of reaching out 'cause I remember... 
 This is what I want to say to you 
 If I had one chance to speak to your heart 
 You are loved 
 More than you could ever know 
 This is what I want to say to you 
 If I had one chance to tell you something 
 You are loved 
 More than you can imagine 
 Imagine 
 If I told you would you believe, the narrow road, I did not leave 
 If I told you would you understand that I've found truth 
 Are you jaded? Are you hurting now? How I wish that I could tell 
 Where your heart's at... can you see? Mine has found - home 
 Not sure if I've, made it clear enough 
 It's not my love I sing about 
 Everybody asks, "Is God good?" 
 I believe, He is 
 In fact I know, He is

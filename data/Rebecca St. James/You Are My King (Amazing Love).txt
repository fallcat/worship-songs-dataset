I'm forgiven because You were forsaken 
 I'm accepted; You were condemned 
 I'm alive and well, You Spirit is within me 
 Because You died and rose again 
 Amazing love! How can it be? 
 That You, my King, would die for me? 
 Amazing love! I know it's true 
 And it's my joy to honor You 
 In all I do, I honour You 
 You are my King. You are my King. 
 Jesus, You are my King. Jesus, You are my King.

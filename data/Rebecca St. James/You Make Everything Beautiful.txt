Grant me serenity to accept things 
 The things I cannot change 
 Grant me the courage, Lord, to change what I can 
 Wisdom to know the difference 
 In my weakness You can shine 
 In Your strength I can fly and 
 You make everything, everything beautiful 
 You make everything, everything new 
 You make everything, everything beautiful 
 In its time, in Your time 
 It's beautiful 
 Grant me serenity, Lord, and patience 
 For things will take time 
 Grant me freedom to walk a new path 
 And let me feel Your love 
 In my weakness You can shine 
 In Your strength I can fly and 
 Lifting open hands to You my Savior 
 Beautify my soul 
 Knowing You redeem my pain and failure 
 Purify my soul 
 Beautify my soul

Oh how beautiful the sound 
 That has saved a wretch like me 
 I was lost but I am found 
 I was captive till you made me free 
 It was grace that taught my heart 
 How to marvel at your name 
 Breaking all my fears apart 
 Taking all my doubt and shame 
 And it all comes down to this 
 Yeah it all comes down to 
 Your grace is amazing to me 
 Your love is still such a wonder 
 Your cross is still bringing me to my knees oh god 
 You still amaze me 
 When I stand before your throne 
 I will bring eternal praise 
 For my heart has found a home 
 And a reason still to say 
 That it all comes down to this 
 Yeah it all comes down to 
 Your grace is amazing to me 
 Your love is still such a wonder 
 Your cross is still bringing me to my knees oh god 
 And I am amazed 
 How you paid in death every sinner's wage 
 How you loved me first so you took my place 
 And redemption came through the work of grace 
 It's amazing so amazing 
 And it all comes down to this 
 Yeah it all comes down to

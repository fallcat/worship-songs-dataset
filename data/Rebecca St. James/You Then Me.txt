It's my turn, it's not your turn 
 It's my turn, get outta my way 
 It's my turn, go on complain 
 I'm comin' through anyway 
 Don't ask me why I'm like this 
 But lately I'm wonderin' if 
 It'll come to pass 
 That the last shall be first and the first shall be last 
 Then the voice says 
 Chrous: 
 Here's the way it oughtta be 
 You then me then you then me 
 Well. I pray one day we'll all agree 
 And take it you then me then you then me 
 Life could go you then me then you then me 
 It's easy, you wait then go 
 It's easy, so make your move 
 It's easy, don't clown around 
 Could've gane six times by now 
 But no sir, you gotta be a pain 
 Or is this your own way of sayin' 
 We should all cool down 
 And be more like the man who was born back in Bethlehem Town? 
 I betcha He'd say... 
 If we could only put you first 
 Maybe this ugly trend could one day be reversed 
 It's your turn, it's not my turn 
 It's you turn- well let's just say 
 We'll trade off- first you then me 
 Then after that, we might agree 
 Let's try it, it could be good 
 And what if one day it should 
 Really come to pass 
 That the last shall go first and the first shall go last 
 Betcha we'd say:

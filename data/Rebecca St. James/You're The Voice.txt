We have the chance to turn the pages over 
 We can write what we want to write 
 We gotta make ends meet before we get much older 
 We're all someone's daughter 
 We're all someone's son 
 How long can we look at each other 
 Down the barrel of a gun? 
 You're the voice, try and understand it 
 Make a noise and make it clear 
 We're not gonna sit in silence 
 We're not gonna live with fear 
 This time, you know we all can stand together 
 With the power to be powerful 
 Believing, we can make it better 
 We're all someone's daughter 
 We're all someone's son 
 How long can we look at each other 
 Down the barrel of a gun? 
 Repeat 
 We're all someone's daughter 
 We're all someone's son 
 How long can we look at each other 
 Down the barrel of a gun

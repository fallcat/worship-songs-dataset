To be like You 
 Is what I want, Lord 
 To be like You 
 Is what I ask for 
 To be like You 
 Is what I'm longing for 
 'Cause at the end of the day 
 This is what will remain 
 To love like You 
 Is what I want, Lord 
 To love like You 
 Is what I ask for 
 To love like You 
 Is what I'm longing for 
 'Cause at the end of the day 
 This is what will remain 
 You 
 Are what I want, Lord 
 You 
 Are what I ask for 
 You 
 Are what I'm longing for 
 'Cause at the end of the day 
 You alone will remain 
 You 
 Are what I want, Lord

 You alone will remain 
 I love You 
 'Cause at the end of the day, 
 You alone will remain.

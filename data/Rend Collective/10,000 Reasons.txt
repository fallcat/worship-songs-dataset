The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning 
 It's time to sing your song again 
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me 
 Let me be singing when the evening comes 
 Bless the Lord, oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Worship his holy name 
 Sing like never before 
 Oh, my soul 
 I'll worship your holy name 
 You're rich in love, and you're slow to anger 
 Your name is great, and your heart is kind 
 For all your goodness I will keep on singing 
 Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find 
 Bless the Lord, oh, my soul 
 Bless the Lord, oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Worship his holy name 
 Sing like never before 
 Oh, my soul 
 I'll worship your holy name 
 Sing my soul, oh, my soul 
 Bless the Lord, oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Worship his holy name 
 Sing like never before 
 Oh, my soul 
 I'll worship your holy name 
 And on that day when my strength is failing 
 The end draws near and my time has come 
 Still my soul will sing your praise unending 
 Ten thousand years and then forevermore 
 Bless the Lord 
 Bless the Lord, oh, my soul 
 Oh, my soul 
 Worship his holy name 
 Sing like never before 
 Oh, my soul 
 I'll worship your holy name 
 I'll worship your holy name 
 I'll worship your holy name

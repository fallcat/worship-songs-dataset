You rule over distant seas 
 And every part of me 
 You raise the day from 
 Night and the song inside 
 Of me, You watch the 
 Planets spin and my 
 Eyelids flickering 
 Beyond everything else 
 You are, you are, Above 
 Everything else you are 
 Greater than life itself 
 More precious than 
 Perfect health, Finer than 
 Friendship or romance 
 More needed than oxygen 
 More pleasing than thrill 
 Or fame, Stronger than 
 Death or gravity 
 You speak the waves 
 Obey, yet you whisper 
 Peace to me, You hold the 
 Skys in place and my past 
 And destiny, You reign 
 Over war torn lands, over 
 Famine, fear and kings 
 Beyond everything else 
 You are, you are, Above 
 Everything else you are 
 Greater than life itself 
 More precious than 
 Perfect health, Finer than 
 Friendship or romance 
 More needed than oxygen 
 More pleasing than thrill 
 Or fame, Stronger than 
 Death or gravity 
 King Jesus You are 
 Victorious, You are 
 King Jesus You are 
 Victorious 
 Greater than life itself 
 More precious than 
 Perfect health, Finer than 
 Friendship or romance 
 More needed than oxygen 
 More pleasing than thrill 
 Or fame, Stronger than 
 Death or gravity

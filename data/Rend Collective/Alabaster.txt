I am broken at Your feet 
 Like an alabaster jar 
 Every piece of who I am 
 Laid before Your majesty 
 I will bow my life 
 At Your feet 
 At Your feet 
 My lips 
 So lost for words 
 Will kiss Your feet 
 Kiss Your feet 
 Oh the gravity of You 
 Draws my soul unto its knees 
 I will never be the same 
 I am lost and found in You

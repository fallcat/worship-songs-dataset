Take every treasure, take this life 
 Everything's on the altar now 
 No holding back, no holding out 
 In view of Your matchless sacrifice 
 Take every treasure, take this life 
 All that I am for all that you are, my Lord 
 All that I have for all that you are 
 You're the pearl beyond price 
 Greater than life 
 All that I am for all that you are 
 Selfish ambition and my pride 
 I'm givin' up, I'm letting die 
 In these empty hands I have it all 
 The pure joy of knowing You my Lord 
 It's only in surrender that I'm free 
 It's only in surrender that I'm truly free 
 It's only in surrender that I'm free 
 It's only in surrender that I'm truly free 
 I am free, I am free indeed 
 I am free, I am free indeed

By grace alone somehow I stand 
 Where even angels fear to tread 
 Invited by redeeming love 
 Before the throne of God above 
 He pulls me close with nail-scarred hands 
 Into his everlasting arms 
 When condemnation grips my heart 
 And Satan tempts me to despair 
 I hear the voice that scatters fear 
 The great I am the lord is here 
 Oh, praise the one who fights for me 
 And shields my soul eternally 
 Boldly I approach your throne 
 Blameless now I'm running home 
 By your blood I come 
 Welcomed as your own 
 Into the arms of majesty 
 Behold the bright and risen son 
 More beauty than this world has known 
 I'm face to face with love himself 
 His perfect spotless righteousness 
 A thousand years, a thousand tongues 
 Are not enough to sing his praise 
 Boldly I approach your throne 
 Blameless now I'm running home 
 By your blood I come 
 Welcomed as your own 
 Into the arms of majesty 
 This is the art of celebration 
 Knowing were free from condemnation 
 Oh, praise the one, praise the one 
 Who made an end to all my sin 
 Boldly I approach your throne 
 Blameless now I'm running home 
 By your blood I come 
 Welcomed as your own 
 Into the arms of majesty

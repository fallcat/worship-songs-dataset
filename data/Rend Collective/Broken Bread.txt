May I be broken bread, may I be poured out wine 
 May I incarnate, Your kindness Lord 
 Spend my life Jesus, anyway You please 
 Whether on great things, or what seems small 
 Your will done your way 
 Your will done your way 
 Your will done your way 
 I will not fight You 
 Take me past the line that my heart draws 
 I will not fight You 
 Take me beyond the laziness of my thoughts 
 I will not fight 
 Lead me further than I've gone before 
 I will not fight You 
 I'm abandoned to Your call 
 Do not let there be, any part of me 
 That's untouchable, unreachable 
 Let my delight be, living out Your dreams 
 Washing dirty feet, and kissing yours 
 God let Your dreams come true, dream through us 
 God let Your dreams come true through us

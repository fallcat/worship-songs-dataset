Build your kingdom here 
 Let the darkness fear 
 Show your mighty hand 
 Heal our streets and land 
 Set your church on fire 
 Win this nation back 
 Change the atmosphere 
 Build your kingdom here 
 We pray 
 Come set your rule and reign 
 In our hearts again 
 Increase in us, we pray 
 Unveil why we're made 
 Come set our hearts ablaze with hope 
 Like wildfire in our very souls 
 Holy Spirit come invade us now 
 We are your church 
 And we need your power 
 In us 
 Let's go! 
 We seek your kingdom first 
 We hunger and we thirst 
 Refuse to waste our lives 
 For you're our joy and prize 
 To see the captive hearts released 
 The hurt, the sick, the poor, at peace 
 We lay down our lives for Heaven's cause 
 We are your church 
 And we pray revive 
 This earth 
 We're praying for revival 
 Build your kingdom here 
 Let the darkness fear 
 Show your mighty hand 
 Heal our streets and land 
 Set your church on fire 
 Win this nation back 
 Change the atmosphere 
 Build your kingdom here 
 We pray 
 Change the atmosphere 
 Unleash your kingdom's power 
 Reaching the near and far 
 No force of hell can stop 
 Your beauty changing hearts 
 'Cause you made us for much more than this 
 Awake the kingdom seed in us 
 Fill us with the strength and love 
 Of Christ 
 We are your church 
 We are the hope 
 On earth 
 Come on, church! 
 Build your kingdom here 
 Let the darkness fear 
 Show your mighty hand 
 Heal our streets and land 
 Set your church on fire 
 Win this nation back 
 Change the atmosphere 
 Build your kingdom here 
 We pray 
 Change the atmosphere 
 Build your kingdom here 
 Build your kingdom here 
 Let the darkness fear 
 Show your mighty hand 
 Heal our streets and land 
 Set your church on fire 
 Win this nation back 
 Change the atmosphere 
 Build your kingdom here 
 We pray 
 Let's win this nation back

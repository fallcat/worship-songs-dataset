We were born for greater things 
 We were born for chase Your dreams 
 Come my Lord, awaken holy fire 
 We are turning from our sin 
 We are praying once again 
 Come my Lord, awaken holy fire 
 We are aching for the real thing 
 Hearts are open wide 
 Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts 
 Send revival start in us 
 Set Your holy spark in us 
 Send us out in resurrection power 
 History's about to change 
 We are rising once again 
 Send us out in resurrection power 
 We are aching for the real thing 
 Hearts are open wide 
 Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts 
 Four Your glory 
 For Your fame 
 In this darkness 
 Light a flame in us 
 Burn like a star, light a fire in our hearts

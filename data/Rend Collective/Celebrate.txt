Praise Him in the morning, praise Him in the evening 
 Praise Him when you're smiling, praise Him when you're breaking 
 Praise Him in the sun and praise Him in the starlight 
 Praise Him every season, praise Him through the dark times 
 Celebrate, celebrate 
 Shout it from the mountaintops 
 Celebrate, celebrate 
 Even with a broken heart 
 Till dawn awakes, we'll sing Your praise, dancing in the dark 
 For all our days our song will say, "Lord how great You are!" 
 Praise Him with your hands and praise Him with your face down 
 Praise Him with the trumpet, praise Him with a loud sound 
 Heaven is a party, join the celebration 
 Come on everybody, time to start dancing! 
 Celebrate, celebrate 
 Shout it from the mountaintops 
 Celebrate, celebrate 
 Even with a broken heart 
 Till dawn awakes, we'll sing Your praise, dancing in the dark 
 For all our days our song will say, "Lord how great You are" 
 Sing it out loud, sing it out strong! 
 Celebrate, celebrate 
 Shout it from the mountaintops 
 Celebrate, celebrate 
 Even with a broken heart 
 Till dawn awakes, we'll sing Your praise, dancing in the dark 
 For all our days our song will say, "Lord how great You are"

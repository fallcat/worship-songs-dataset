You open horizons in my life 
 Of limitless 
 And cloudless hope 
 You defy the gravity in me 
 And give wings to 
 My flightiness 
 Christ has set me free 
 From negativity 
 From impossibility 
 Christ has set me free 
 All hope has been released 
 O Christ has set me free 
 You have taught my future how to shine 
 All the colors of 
 Eternity 
 You've given my soul the space to breathe 
 And discover what 
 It is to simply be

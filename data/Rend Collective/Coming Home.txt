True love is calling 
 I'm coming running home to You 
 Though I am broken 
 Grace is my welcome home to You 
 I'm coming home to You 
 I'm coming home to You 
 You are where I belong 
 And now I'm coming home to You 
 You are the guided 
 Soul that I'm chasing home to You 
 Like a wave to the shoreline 
 I'm coming crashing home to You 
 I'm coming home to You 
 I'm coming home to You 
 You are where I belong 
 And now I'm coming home to You 
 You are my first love to my last breath 
 You are my first love to my final breath 
 I'm coming home to You 
 I'm coming home to You 
 You are where I belong 
 And now I'm coming home to You

Create in me a clean, clean heart 
 Create in me a work of art 
 Create in me a miracle 
 Something real and something beautiful 
 Create a miracle in me 
 You're not finished with me yet 
 You're not finished with me yet 
 By your power I can change, I can change 
 'Cause you're not finished with me yet 
 Make all things new 
 You're not finished with me yet 
 You're not finished with me yet 
 By your power I can change, I can change 
 'Cause you're not finished with me yet 
 Create in me a clean, clean heart 
 Create in me a work of art 
 Create in me a miracle 
 Something real and something beautiful 
 Create a miracle in me 
 You're not finished with me yet 
 You're not finished with me yet 
 By your power I can change, I can change 
 'Cause you're not finished with me yet

I love You Lord 
 But I want to love You more 
 I need You God 
 But I want to need You more 
 I'm lost without 
 Your creative spark in me 
 I'm dead inside 
 Unless Your resurrection sings 
 I'm desperate for a desperate heart 
 I'm reaching out, I'm reaching 
 All that I am is dry bones 
 Without You Lord, a desert soul 
 I am broken but running 
 Towards You God, You make me whole 
 You are exactly what we need 
 Only You can satisfy

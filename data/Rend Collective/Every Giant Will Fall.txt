I can see the Promised Land 
 Though there's pain within the plan 
 There is victory in the end 
 Your love is my battle cry 
 When my fear's like Jericho 
 Build their walls around my soul 
 When my heart is overthrown 
 Your love is my battle cry 
 The anthem for all my life 
 Every giant will fall, the mountains will move 
 Every chain of the past, You've broken in two 
 Over fear, over lies, we're singing the truth 
 That nothing is impossible with You (woah) 
 With You (woah) 
 There is hope within the fight 
 In the wars that rage inside 
 Though the shadows steal the light 
 Your love is my battle cry 
 The anthem for all my life 
 Every giant will fall, the mountains will move 
 Every chain of the past, You've broken in two 
 Over fear, over lies, we're singing the truth 
 That nothing is impossible 
 Every giant will fall, the mountains will move 
 Every chain of the past, You've broken in two 
 Over fear, over lies, we're singing the truth 
 That nothing is impossible with You (woah) 
 With You (woah) 
 No greater name, no higher name 
 No stronger name than Jesus 
 You overcame, broke every chain 
 Forever reign, King Jesus 
 No greater name, no higher name 
 No stronger name than Jesus 
 You overcame, broke every chain 
 Forever reign, King Jesus 
 Every giant will fall, the mountains will move 
 Every chain of the past, You've broken in two 
 Over fear, over lies, we're singing the truth 
 That nothing is impossible 
 Every giant will fall, the mountains will move 
 Every chain of the past, You've broken in two 
 Over fear, over lies, we're singing the truth 
 That nothing is impossible with You (woah) 
 With You (woah) 
 Oh nothing is impossible

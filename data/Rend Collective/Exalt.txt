I'm bare before You, O risen Jesus 
 Can't hide from You, Your kindness is too strong 
 Today you kneel, you wash my feet 
 Where the dirt of sin has harmed me 
 Who has heard of such majesty 
 Glorious one I let down the walls again 
 There's nothing that's sweeter than Your friendship 
 There's nothing greater than Your Lordship 
 I exalt You, I exalt You, I exalt You and enjoy You 
 I exalt You, I exalt You, I exalt You 
 You're the colour of my world 
 You are my sight, my life's guide 
 Though I'm blind, You brighten the way 
 The troubles they are many 
 And I feel I'm losing 
 But You rescue me in Your time 
 Glorious One You redeem all my mistakes 
 There's nothing that's stronger than Your overwhelming grace 
 And Your truth is my wide open space 
 There's nothing that's sweeter than your friendship 
 There's nothing greater than your Lordship 
 There's nothing that's stronger than your overwhelming grace 
 And Your truth is my wide open space

There's no words that You've spoken 
 That haven't brought hope 
 No promise You've made 
 You haven't fulfilled 
 Faithful Jesus 
 An offering of praise I bring to You 
 Such grace that no man 
 Could ever repay 
 Patience that outlives 
 The doubts in my head 
 Faithful Jesus 
 An offering of praise I bring to You 
 Surrounded by gifts of love 
 You express in life the depth of Your love 
 Jesus, I will put my hope in You 
 No idols compare to who You are, all You've given 
 I live to honour and worship You 
 Be like a window to who You are, all You've given to me 
 You're faithful to the end

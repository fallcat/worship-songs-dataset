Your mercy rains from heaven 
 Like confetti at a wedding 
 And I am celebrating 
 In the down pour 
 Your heart is wild with colour 
 Like a never-ending summer 
 You burn away the winter 
 Of my cold and weary heart 
 My soul cries out holy holy 
 My heart is lost in your beauty 
 All hope is found in your mercy 
 You paid the price now I am 
 Finally free 
 Your grace, oh, God's the anchor 
 That's holding me forever 
 Come trouble or high water 
 I am steadfast 
 You lift me when I'm sinking 
 Like the swell of mighty oceans 
 The power of redemption 
 It gives me wings to soar 
 We'll cast our crowns before him 
 Like the rusting leaves of autumn 
 Now every chain lies broken

Little people slipping 
 Through the cracks 
 We've got a system but it 
 Won't bring them back 
 Disappearing down black 
 Holes of what we don't 
 Want to know 
 Civilization seems to rest 
 On all the people that we 
 Can forget 
 I don't want to live off the 
 Grid anymore 
 Find your kindness why 
 Can't we find our 
 Kindness find your 
 Kindness now 
 Find your kindness why 
 Can't we find our 
 Kindness find your 
 Kindness now 
 Twenty first century life 
 (We got) neon lights and 
 Satellites, How do we 
 Miss what's before our 
 Eyes, Media can freeze ya 
 Into collective amnesia 
 And I don't want to forget 
 Anymore 
 Find your kindness why 
 Can't we find our 
 Kindness find your 
 Kindness now 
 Find your kindness why 
 Can't we find our 
 Kindness find your 
 Kindness now 
 When did democracy 
 Become a paper chasing 
 Bureaucracy 
 All of our hands got tied 
 And we don't know how 
 To be kind 
 Put a face to a name a 
 Real person to the 
 Numbers game 
 I don't wanna hesitate 
 Anymore

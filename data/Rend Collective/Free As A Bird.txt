You break us out of our cages 
 Into the wide open spaces 
 We are free 
 Free as a bird on the wind 
 No prison wall can contain us 
 Your beating heart makes us fearless 
 We are free 
 Free as a bird on the wind 
 Love cannot be tamed 
 You shattered every chain 
 Let our praises run wild and free 
 The lionheart is alive in me 
 Let our freedom and joy begin 
 With you we're dancing upon our chains 
 With you we're soaring on eagle's wings 
 Take us beyond our horizons 
 Leading us into your wildness 
 We are free 
 Free as a bird on the wind 
 You are the greatest adventure 
 You are my uncharted waters 
 We are free 
 Free as a bird on the wind 
 Love cannot be tamed 
 You shattered every chain 
 Let our praises run wild and free 
 The lionheart is alive in me 
 Let our freedom and joy begin 
 With you we're dancing upon our chains 
 With you we're soaring on eagle's wings 
 You made us for so much more 
 You take us to greater shores 
 You raise us above the storm 
 We rise on eagle's wings, we rise on eagle's wings 
 Let our praises run wild and free 
 The lionheart is alive in me 
 Let our freedom and joy begin 
 With you we're dancing upon our chains 
 With you we're soaring on eagle's wings

No one really knows 
 What it is to be alone 
 Since you've never left 
 Our side 
 Omnipresence means 
 That your never far away 
 Your always within reach 
 Hallelujah God is near 
 Hallelujah, Christ is close 
 We've been oceans apart 
 But you part oceans to be 
 With me, nothing can 
 Keep you away 
 God is near 
 You're living in me now 
 Built your home inside my 
 Soul, and your never 
 Moving out 
 Hallelujah God is near 
 Hallelujah, Christ is close 
 Hallelujah God you're here 
 You're close than a whisper 
 Close enough to hear my 
 Heart beat, you're closer 
 Than a kiss, close enough 
 To raise my heart beat

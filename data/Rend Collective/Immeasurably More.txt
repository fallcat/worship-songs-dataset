More than all we ask 
 Than all we seek 
 All our hopes and dreams 
 You are immeasurably more 
 Than we can know 
 Than we can pray 
 All our words can say 
 You are immeasurably more 
 There's nothing greater than Your love 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 There's nothing sweeter on this earth 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 Our hearts respond to who You are 
 It's You oh Lord that we adore 
 You are more, You are more 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 You are more, You are more 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 More than all our sin 
 Than all our shame 
 Stronger than the grave 
 You are immeasurably more 
 I can't help but sing 
 Can't help but praise 
 My heart can not contain 
 You are immeasurably more 
 There's nothing greater than Your love 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 There's nothing sweeter on this earth 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 Our hearts respond to who You are 
 It's You oh Lord that we adore 
 You are more, You are more 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 You are more, You are more 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard 
 What is coming, what is coming 
 Never-ending joy, never-failing love 
 You are coming, You are coming 
 (x2) 
 You are coming, You are coming 
 There's nothing greater than Your love 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 There's nothing sweeter on this earth 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 Our hearts respond to who You are 
 It's You oh Lord that we adore 
 You are more, You are more 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 You are more, You are more 
 You're more than we can imagine 
 You are more, You are more 
 You're more than we can imagine>

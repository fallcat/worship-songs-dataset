Come the day and come the hour 
 Come the power and the glory 
 We have come to answer 
 Our Country's call 
 From the four proud provinces of Ireland 
 Ireland, Ireland 
 Together standing tall 
 Shoulder to shoulder 
 We'll answer Ireland's call 
 From the mighty Glens of Antrim 
 From the rugged hills of Galway 
 From the walls of Limerick 
 And Dublin Bay 
 From the four proud provinces of Ireland 
 Ireland, Ireland 
 Together standing tall 
 Shoulder to shoulder 
 We'll answer Ireland's call 
 Hearts of steel and heads unbowing 
 Vowing never to be broken 
 We will fight until we can fight no more 
 From the four proud provinces of Ireland 
 Ireland, Ireland 
 Together standing tall 
 Shoulder to shoulder 
 We'll answer Ireland's call

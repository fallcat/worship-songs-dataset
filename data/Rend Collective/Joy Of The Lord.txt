Though the tears may fall my song will rise 
 My song will rise to You 
 Though my heart may fail my song will rise 
 My song will rise to You 
 While there's breath in my lungs 
 I will praise you Lord 
 In the dead of night I'll lift my eyes 
 I'll lift my eyes to You 
 Though the waters rise I'll lift my eyes 
 I'll lift my eyes to You 
 While there's hope in this heart 
 I will praise You Lord 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 In the darkness I'll dance 
 In the shadows I'll sing 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 When I cannot see You with my eyes 
 Let faith arise to You 
 When I cannot feel Your hand in mine 
 Let faith arise to You 
 God of mercy and love 
 I will praise You Lord 
 How You shine with glory Lord of light 
 I feel alive with You 
 In Your presence now I come alive 
 I am alive with You 
 There is strength when I say 
 I will praise You Lord 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 In the darkness I'll dance 
 In the shadows I'll sing 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 When sorrow comes my way 
 You are the shield around me 
 Always You remain 
 My courage in the fight 
 I hear You call my name 
 Jesus I am coming 
 Walking on the waves 
 Reaching for Your light 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 In the darkness I'll dance 
 In the shadows I'll sing 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength

We're choosing celebration, breaking into freedom 
 You're the song, you're the song 
 Of our hearts 
 We cast aside our shadows, trust you with our sorrows 
 You're the song, you're the song 
 Of our hearts 
 We're dancing to the rhythm of your heart 
 We're rising from the ashes to the stars 
 You're the joy, joy, joy 
 Lighting my soul 
 The joy, joy, joy 
 Making me whole 
 Though I am broken, I am running 
 Into your arms of love 
 The pain will not define us, joy will reignite us 
 You're the song, you're the song 
 Of our hearts 
 The dark is just a canvas, for your grace and brightness 
 You're the song, you're the song 
 Of our hearts 
 You're the joy! 
 In the shadows, in the sorrows 
 In the desert, when the pain hits 
 You are constant, ever-present 
 You're the song of my heart 
 You're the joy, joy, joy 
 Lighting my soul 
 The joy, joy, joy 
 Making me whole 
 Though I am broken, I am running 
 Into your arms of love 
 Into your arms

Breath of God will You breathe on me like a hurricane? 
 Fill the sails of my heart once more like a rushing wind? 
 Flame of God will You spark something in my soul again? 
 If we are embers then surely You are the oxygen 
 You're my oxygen 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 Sets my soul on fire forever 
 Just a taste of You 
 And my world's alive with wonder 
 Just one touch from You 
 Fills my heart beyond all measure 
 Open my eyes, invade my life 
 My Lord 
 Light of God will You shine through me in my brokenness? 
 Raise a torch, burn a path for me through the wilderness? 
 Voice of God will You call me into Your radiance? 
 'Cause we are sinners but surely You are the saving grace 
 You're my saving grace 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 Sets my soul on fire forever 
 Just a taste of You 
 And my world's alive with wonder 
 Just one touch from You 
 Fills my heart beyond all measure 
 Open my eyes, invade my life 
 My Lord 
 I can't do this without You 
 You're my fire 
 You're my fire 
 I can't do this without You, Lord 
 I am reaching out for you 
 My desire 
 My desire 
 I am reaching out for You, Lord 
 Just a glimpse of You 
 Sets my soul on fire forever 
 Just a taste of You 
 And my world's alive with wonder 
 Just one touch from You 
 Fills my heart beyond all measure 
 Open my eyes, invade my life 
 My Lord

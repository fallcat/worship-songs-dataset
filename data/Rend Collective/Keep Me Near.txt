Jesus keep me near to Your heart 
 For outside of You I'm lost 
 Draw me in the tide of Your will 
 Lead me as I yield myself to You 
 Keep me near Your heart 
 Keep me near Your heart 
 Rescue me in weakness of mind 
 When distraction conquers me 
 Keep me in Your shadow oh Lord 
 Give me grace to follow where You lead 
 Keep me near Your heart 
 Keep me near Your heart 
 For You are everything that is beautiful 
 And You are all that I long to see in me 
 You are everything that is beautiful 
 Breathe Your desires in me 
 Keep me in the place where You are 
 For Your presence is my joy 
 Break my selfish nature and pride 
 Mould a life of loyalty to You 
 Keep me near Your heart 
 Keep me near Your heart 
 Form in us a heart of divine beauty

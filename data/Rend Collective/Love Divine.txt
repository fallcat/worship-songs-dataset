Love Divine, all love excelling 
 Joy of heaven, to earth come down 
 Fix in us Thy humble dwelling 
 All Thy faithful mercies crown 
 Jesus, Thou art all compassion 
 Pure, unbounded love Thou art 
 Visit us with Thy salvation 
 Enter every trembling heart 
 Breathe, oh, breathe Thy loving Spirit 
 Into every troubled breast 
 Let us all in Thee inherit 
 Let us find the promised rest 
 Take away the love of sinning 
 Alpha and Omega be 
 End of faith as its beginning 
 Set our hearts at liberty 
 Come, Almighty, to deliver 
 Let us all Thy life receive 
 Suddenly return and never 
 Nevermore, Thy temples leave 
 May we be a blessing to Thee 
 Serve Thee as Thy hosts above 
 Pray and praise Thee without ceasing 
 Glory in Thy perfect love 
 Finish, then, Thy new creation 
 Pure and spotless let us be 
 Let us see Thy great salvation 
 Perfectly restored in Thee 
 Changed from glory into glory 
 Till in heaven we take our place 
 Till we cast our crowns before Thee 
 Lost in wonder, love and praise

When my hope and strength is gone 
 You're the one who calls me on 
 You are the life, You are the fight that's in my soul 
 Oh, your resurrection power 
 Burns like fire in my heart 
 When waters rise 
 I lift my eyes up to your throne 
 We are more than conquerors through Christ 
 You have overcome this world, this life 
 We will not bow to sin or to shame 
 We are defiant in your name 
 You are the fire that cannot be tamed 
 You are the power in our veins 
 Our Lord, our God, our conqueror 
 I will sing into the night 
 Christ is risen and on high 
 Greater is he, living in me than in the world 
 No surrender, no retreat 
 We are free and we're redeemed 
 We will declare over despair 
 You are the hope 
 We are more than conquerors through Christ 
 You have overcome this world, this life 
 We will not bow to sin or to shame 
 We are defiant in your name 
 You are the fire that cannot be tamed 
 You are the power in our veins 
 Our Lord, our God, our conqueror 
 Nothing is impossible 
 Every chain is breakable 
 With you, we are victorious 
 You are stronger than our hearts 
 You are greater than the dark 
 With you, we are victorious 
 Nothing is impossible 
 Every chain is breakable 
 With you, we are victorious 
 Jesus, you are stronger than our hearts 
 You are greater than the dark 
 With you, we are victorious 
 Nothing is impossible 
 Every chain is breakable 
 With you, we are victorious 
 You are stronger than our hearts 
 You are greater than the dark 
 With you, we are victorious 
 We are more than conquerors through Christ 
 You have overcome this world, this life 
 We will not bow to sin or to shame 
 We are defiant in your name 
 You are the fire that cannot be tamed 
 You are the power in our veins 
 Our Lord, our God 
 We are more than conquerors through Christ 
 You have overcome this world, this life 
 We will not bow to sin or to shame 
 We are defiant in your name 
 You are the fire that cannot be tamed 
 You are the power in our veins 
 Our Lord, our God, our conqueror

I wanna soar with You 
 Upon wings like eagles 
 But I'll crawl with You too 
 When the dark and lonely questions come 
 I wanna stand true 
 No matter what's new or comes through 
 I can't stand still 
 Whatever hits I'll keep making movements to You 
 I'm running fast and free to You 
 'Cause You are the movement and fight in me 
 I'm running fast and free to You 
 'Cause You are my home where I wanna be 
 Come move in me 
 Where I wanna be, come move in me 
 I wanna float with you 
 The currents driving me 
 But I'll paddle hard too 
 When the waves and rapids overcome 
 I wanna stand firm 
 When my mind's weak and my emotions squirm 
 I must stand true 
 Whatever hits I'll keep making movements to You 
 I won't walk away, won't walk away

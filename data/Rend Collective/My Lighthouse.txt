In my wrestling and in my doubts 
 In my failures, you won't walk out 
 Your great love will lead me through 
 You are the peace in my troubled sea 
 You are the peace in my troubled sea 
 In the silence, you won't let go 
 In the questions, your truth will hold 
 Your great love will lead me through 
 You are the peace in my troubled sea 
 You are the peace in my troubled sea 
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse 
 Shining in the darkness, I will follow you 
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse 
 I will trust the promise 
 You will carry me safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
 Safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
 Safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
 Safe to shore 
 I won't fear what tomorrow brings 
 With each morning I'll rise and sing 
 My God's love will lead me through 
 You are the peace in my troubled sea 
 You are the peace in my troubled sea 
 Fire before us, you're the brightest 
 You will lead us through the storms 
 Fire before us, you're the brightest 
 You will lead us through the storms

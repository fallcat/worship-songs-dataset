You are my Shepherd 
 Faithful forever 
 Your hand is strong 
 When my faith is weak 
 Close as my heartbeat 
 You won't forsake me 
 You are the love 
 That will carry me 
 I won't be afraid 
 I will trust Your heart and say 
 I will never, ever, ever walk alone 
 You are with us, for us, always holding on 
 Though I wander your love goes further 
 You are my hope and future 
 I will never walk alone 
 Questions may haunt us 
 Casting their shadows 
 Still You're the hope 
 And the fire in me 
 I will not tremble 
 I will not stumble 
 You are my courage 
 My bravery 
 I won't be afraid 
 I will trust Your heart and say 
 I will never, ever, ever walk alone 
 You are with us, for us, always holding on 
 Though I wander your love goes further 
 You are my hope and future 
 I will never walk alone 
 Surely Your Goodness and Mercy 
 Will light up the way set before me 
 Surely Your grace will pursue me 
 All my days all my days 
 I will never, ever, ever walk alone 
 You are with us, for us, always holding on 
 Though I wander your love goes further 
 You are my hope and future 
 I will never walk alone

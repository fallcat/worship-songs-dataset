Jesus You are the anchor of my soul 
 But You never weigh me down 
 Solid as rock and heavy on my heart 
 But You never weigh me down 
 Faithful one 
 How I'm counting on Your loving kindness 
 Heaven's sun 
 How you shine and sweep away the shadows 
 You are a force, strong as gravity 
 But You never weigh me down 
 I've carried my cross 
 But You have carried me 
 And You never weighed me down 
 No, You never weighed me down 
 Shine on me 
 Shine on me 
 Shine on me 
 Shine on me 
 Heaven shine on me 
 Heaven shine on me 
 Won't You shine?

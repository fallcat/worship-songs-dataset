Who spoke and taught the sun to rise 
 Whose lips proclaimed the birth of light 
 Who sparked the kindling of stars 
 And set the fire in our hearts 
 Who sang as planets learned their dance 
 Who poured the oceans from his hands 
 Whose breath awakened life from dust 
 And leaves me breathless at His touch 
 Jesus, One and Only 
 Great and Holy 
 We are yours 
 How our hearts race 
 At your glory 
 Lord Almighty 
 We are yours 
 And yours alone 
 Who is this man upon a cross 
 Who left his throne to ransom us 
 Who died to save us at our worst 
 And rose to give us Heaven's best 
 You rose to give us Heaven's best 
 Jesus, One and Only 
 Great and Holy 
 We are yours 
 How our hearts race 
 At your glory 
 Lord Almighty 
 We are yours 
 And yours alone 
 We will watch the bridegroom come 
 And Heaven breaking like the dawn 
 All dressed in white our shame is gone 
 We're free to dance before your throne 
 Jesus, One and Only 
 Great and Holy 
 We are yours 
 How our hearts race 
 At your glory 
 Lord Almighty 
 We are yours 
 And yours alone

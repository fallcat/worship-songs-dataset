You've given us a heart, given us a home 
 You've given us a heart, given us a home 
 You've given us a heart, given us a home with you 
 I lift my voice to praise you 
 I lift my voice to praise you 
 My concrete heart won't stop me 
 My concrete heart won't stop me 
 I'll sing like it's the first time 
 I'll sing like it's the first time 
 And leave behind the cynic 
 I leave behind the cynic 
 In my soul 
 We're letting praise like fireworks 
 Loose from our thankful hearts 
 We're bringing you our praise, bringing you our lives 
 We're bringing you our praise, bringing you our lives 
 We're bringing you our praise, bringing all our lives to you 
 Through joy and pain we worship 
 Through joy and pain we worship 
 With heart and soul wide open 
 With heart and soul wide open 
 Your strength will never fail us 
 Your strength will never fail us 
 We're not lost in the darkness 
 We're not lost in the darkness 
 You are here

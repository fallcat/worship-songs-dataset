Oh, your cross, it changes everything 
 There my world begins again with you 
 Oh, your cross, it's where my hope restarts 
 A second chance is Heaven's heart 
 My future hangs on this 
 You make preciousness from dust 
 Please don't stop creating me 
 You blood offers the chance 
 To rewind to innocence 
 Reborn perfect as a child 
 Oh, your cross, it changes everything 
 There my world begins again with you 
 Oh, your cross, it's where my hope restarts 
 A second chance is Heaven's heart 
 When sin and ugliness 
 Collide with redemption's kiss 
 Beauty awakens my romance 
 Always inside this mess 
 I have found forgiveness 
 Mercy infinite as you 
 Oh, your cross, it changes everything 
 There my world begins again with you 
 Oh, your cross, it's where my hope restarts 
 A second chance is Heaven's heart 
 Countless! 
 Countless second chances we've been given at the cross 
 Countless second chances we've been given at the cross 
 Fragments of brokenness 
 Salvaged by the art of grace 
 You craft life from our mistakes 
 Like skies of my regrets 
 Outshined by his kindness 
 New life dawns over my soul 
 Oh, your cross, it changes everything 
 There my world begins again with you 
 Oh, your cross, it's where my hope restarts 
 A second chance is Heaven's heart 
 Countless second chances we've been given at the cross 
 Sing countless! 
 Countless second chances we've been given at the cross 
 Countless second chances we've been given at the cross

Shining Star, come and guide our hearts. 
 The angels watched in mystery 
 As You took off Your glory 
 Instead You put on human skin 
 To reconcile all things again 
 You stepped into the darkest night 
 To Blaze the skies with Heaven's sign 
 That we all matter, we are loved 
 That Your heart beat's strong for us 
 What a picture of love! 
 You are Magnificent 
 You are Magnificent 
 You are my Rescuer 
 You light the darkest night 
 You light the darkest night 
 You are the shining star 
 The Angels watched in mystery 
 As You bore all our misery 
 The hands that crafted worlds and stars 
 Chose the pain of human scars 
 You came to die the lowest death 
 To show the human soul its worth 
 And as You burst through the darkness 
 You raised the dead in all of us 
 What a portrait of grace! 
 Shining star come and guide our hearts

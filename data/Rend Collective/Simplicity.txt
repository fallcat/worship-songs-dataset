I come in simplicity 
 Longing for purity 
 To worship you 
 In spirit and truth 
 Only you 
 Lord strip it all away 
 'Til only you remain 
 I'm coming back 
 To my first love 
 Only you 
 You're the reason I sing 
 The reason I sing 
 Yes my heart will sing 
 How I love you 
 And forever I'll sing 
 Forever I'll sing 
 Yes my heart will sing 
 How I love you 
 I come with my broken song 
 To you the perfect one 
 To worship you 
 In spirit and truth 
 Only you 
 Give me a childlike heart 
 Lead me to where you are 
 I'm coming back 
 To my first love 
 Only you 
 How I love you 
 How I love you 
 How I love you

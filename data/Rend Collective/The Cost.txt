I'm saying yes to You 
 And no to my desires 
 I'll leave myself behind 
 And follow You 
 I'll walk the narrow road 
 'Cause it leads me to You 
 I'll fall but grace 
 Will pick me up again 
 I've counted up the cost 
 Oh I've counted up the cost 
 Yes I've counted up the cost 
 And You are worth it 
 I do not need safety 
 As much as I need You 
 You're dangerous 
 But Lord You're beautiful 
 I'll chase You through the pain 
 I'll carry my cross 
 'Cause real love 
 Is not afraid to bleed 
 Jesus 
 Take my all 
 Take my everything 
 I've counted up the cost 
 And You're worth everything

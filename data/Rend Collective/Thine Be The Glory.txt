Thine be the Glory 
 Risen and conquering son 
 Endless is the victory 
 Thou over death has won 
 Make us more than conquerors 
 Through thy deathless love 
 Lead us safe through Jordan 
 To Thy home above 
 Thine be the Glory 
 Risen and conquering son 
 Endless is the victory 
 Thou over death has won 
 You won 
 You won 
 You won 
 Let the church with gladness 
 Hymns of triumph sing 
 For our Lord now liveth 
 Death has lost its sting 
 Thine be the Glory 
 Risen and conquering son 
 Endless is the victory 
 Thou over death has won 
 Yours is the power 
 Yours is the glory 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Forever 
 Thine be the Glory 
 Risen and conquering son 
 Endless is the victory 
 Thou over death has won

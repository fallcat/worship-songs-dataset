The tempo of my heart 
 Beats, adjust to match the 
 Moment, Your presence 
 Wraps around a dust 
 Formed man, Your close 
 Enough to whisper, the 
 Infinite is immanent 
 The one who bought my 
 Heart with blood draws near 
 Immanuel, God is in 
 This place, Immanuel, 
 You are near 
 And I try to take it in, 
 The beauty of it all, 
 The beauty of you, But 
 I admit defeat, it's all 
 Too much for me, You are 
 Just too much for me 
 My heart waits still and 
 Quiet and contemplates 
 The mystery, Of glory 
 Juxtaposed with sin 
 Stained man, It's like two 
 Lovers meeting but 
 Instead of lips connecting 
 My soul is pressed 
 Against true love Himself 
 And I try to take it in, 
 The beauty of it all, 
 The beauty of you, But 
 I admit defeat, it's all 
 Too much for me, You are 
 Just too much for me 
 I'm breathing You in 
 And I'm breathing me out 
 I'm breathing You in 
 Who brings life to me

Whatever I have 
 Whatever I hold 
 There's nothing compares 
 To having You close 
 True intimacy 
 Is my desire 
 To catch Your whispers 
 To carry Your fire 
 You're my ambition 
 My destination 
 More than living 
 More than breathing 
 You're the reason 
 My heart's beating 
 There's nothing greater 
 Than knowing You 
 You unlock my joy 
 You waken my soul 
 Forever I'm Yours 
 Forever You're mine 
 A wonderful truth 
 That you are my life 
 You're my ambition 
 My soul's true mission 
 More than living 
 More than breathing 
 You're the reason 
 My heart's beating 
 So I'm giving 
 Freely yielding 
 You're the reason 
 My heart's beating 
 There's nothing greater than knowing You 
 Nothing greater than knowing You

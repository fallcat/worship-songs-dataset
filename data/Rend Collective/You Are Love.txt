A mind full of questions 
 And a heart full of pain 
 Can't understand why we 
 Are here again 
 But there's grace in this 
 Season, Not just to see us 
 Through, But renew us 
 You are love Lord 
 And Your ways testify 
 You are love Lord 
 Perfectly defined 
 Through the suffering or joy 
 We will confide in your 
 Perfect love 
 You are love 
 A mind full of questions 
 With a future unclear 
 But your perfect love 
 Scatters fear 
 'Cause your will is to build up 
 And not to harm 
 But to complete us 
 It's time to stretch these 
 Legs of faith, And run into 
 This unknown width, The 
 Truth of Your love for us

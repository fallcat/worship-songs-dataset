You are my vision, O king of my heart 
 Nothing else satisfies, only you Lord 
 You are my best thought by day or by night 
 Waking or sleeping, your presence my light 
 You are my wisdom; you are my true word 
 I ever with you, and you with me Lord 
 You're my great Father, and I'm your true son 
 You dwell inside me; together we're one 
 Come on church 
 You are my battle-shield, sword for the fight 
 You're my dignity, you're my delight 
 My shelter 
 You're my sole shelter, and you're my high tower 
 Come raise me heavenward, O Power of my power 
 I don't want riches 
 I don't want riches, or man's empty praise 
 You're my inheritance now and always 
 You and you only, the first in my heart 
 High king of heaven, my treasure you are. 
 High king 
 High king of Heaven, when victory's won 
 May I reach heaven's joy, O bright heaven's Son 
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall 
 Still be my vision, O ruler of all 
 Heart of my own 
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall 
 Still be my vision, O ruler of all 
 Let's worship him!

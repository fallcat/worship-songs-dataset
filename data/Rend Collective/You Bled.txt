You bled your heart out 
 Now I feel love beat in my chest 
 How wonderful 
 You gave your beauty 
 In exchange for my ugliness 
 How wonderful 
 You left your perfection 
 And embraced our rejection 
 How marvellous, how boundless 
 Is Your love, is Your love 
 How wonderful, sacrificial 
 Is Your love for me 
 You put on our chains 
 Sent us out through the open door 
 How wonderful 
 You took our sadness 
 Crowned us with joy and real peace 
 How wonderful 
 You left Your perfection 
 And fought for our redemption 
 Yes Jesus loves me 
 Yes Jesus loves me 
 How wonderful 
 Yes Jesus loves me 
 This is love 
 You gave Yourself

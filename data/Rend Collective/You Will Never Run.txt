You will never run away 
 You're forever mine 
 You will never run away 
 You're by my side 
 Love wide as galaxies 
 Love deeper than the sea 
 Countless as all infinity 
 Love like a shooting star 
 Tearing apart the dark 
 Shining for all eternity 
 Shining for all eternity 
 You will never run away 
 You're forever mine 
 You will never run away 
 You're by my side 
 You will never run away 
 You forever shine 
 You will never run away 
 You're by my side 
 Love stronger than the grave 
 Love rolled the stone away 
 Rising with endless majesty 
 Love takes us by the hand 
 Love is the wildest dance 
 You are the joy and fight in me 
 You are the joy and fight in me 
 You will never run away 
 You're forever mine 
 You will never run away 
 You're by my side 
 You will never run away 
 You forever shine 
 You will never run away 
 You're by my side 
 Hearts open wide 
 Hands lifted high 
 Over the clouds up into the blue sky 
 Hearts open wide 
 Hands lifted high 
 Over the clouds up into the blue sky 
 You will never run away 
 You're forever mine 
 You will never run away 
 You're by my side 
 You will never run away 
 You forever shine 
 You will never run away 
 You're by my side

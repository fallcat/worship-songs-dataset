What can wash away my sin? 
 What can make me whole again? 
 What can make me white as snow? 
 Nothing but Your royal blood 
 What can heal the heart of stone? 
 What can resurrect these bones? 
 There's no other fount I know 
 Nothing but Your royal blood 
 Nothing but Your royal blood 
 Your blood will never lose its power 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Your victory will stand forever 
 Your blood will never lose 
 This was won upon the cross 
 This was written on his scars 
 This has made us conquerors 
 Nothing but Your royal blood 
 Nothing but Your royal blood 
 Your blood will never lose its power 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Your victory will stand forever 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Your blood will never lose its power 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Your victory will stand forever 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Now by this we'll overcome 
 Now by this we'll reach our home 
 Now our sin and shame are gone 
 Only by Your royal blood 
 Now by this we'll overcome 
 Now by this we'll reach our home 
 Now our sin and shame are gone 
 Only by Your royal blood 
 Only by Your royal blood 
 Your blood will never lose its power 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Your victory will stand forever 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Your blood will never lose 
 Your blood will never lose

Here I am waiting, abide in me I pray. 
 Here I am longing for You. 
 Hide me in Your love, bring me to my knees. 
 May I know Jesus more and more. 
 Come live in me, all my life, take over. 
 Come breathe in me, and I will rise on eagle's wings. 
 Come live in me, all my life, take over. 
 Come breathe in me, and I will rise on eagle's wings. 
 Here I am waiting, abide in me I pray. 
 I pray, Lord.  Oh, I pray - spoken 
 Here I am longing for You. 
 Hide me in Your love, bring me to my knees. 
 Oh, we wanna know You, Jesus 
 May I know Jesus more and more. 
 Come live in me, all my life, take over. 
 Come breathe in me, and I will rise on eagle's wings. 
 Come live in me, all my life, take over. 
 Come breathe in me, and I will rise on eagle's wings. 
 I will rise on eagle's wings. 
 I will rise on eagle's wings.

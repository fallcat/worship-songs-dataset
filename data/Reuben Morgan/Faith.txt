 I'm reaching for the prize, I'm giving everything. 
 I give my life for this, it's what I live for. 
 Nothing will keep me from all that You have for me. 
 You hold my head up high, I live for You. 
 Greater is He that's living in me, than he that is in the world. 
 Faith, I can move the mountain, I can do all things through Christ, I know. 
 Faith, standing and believing, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. 
 Yeah

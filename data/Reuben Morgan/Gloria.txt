Bright is the sun that wakens my heart 
 To sing of all You've done 
 Beautiful song You've over me 
 That draws me in Your love 
 Gloria, Gloria in excelsius deo 
 Gloria, Gloria praise the King of heaven 
 Nothing so sweet as Your name on my lips 
 And I will sing forever 
 What could I bring unto Jesus my King? 
 If not my life my all 
 Gloria, Gloria in excelsius deo 
 Gloria, Gloria praise the King of heaven 
 Gloria, Gloria in excelsius deo 
 Gloria, Gloria praise the King of heaven 
 Gloria, Gloria in excelsius deo 
 Gloria, Gloria praise the King of heaven

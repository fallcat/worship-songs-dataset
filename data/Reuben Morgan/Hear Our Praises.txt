Come on - spoken 
 May our homes be filled with dancing. 
 May our streets be filled with joy. 
 May injustice bow to Jesus, as the people turn and pray. 
 From the mountain to the valley, hear our praises rise to You. 
 From the heavens 
 From the heavens to the nations, hear the singing fill the air. 
 Fill the air. 
 May our light shine in the darkness, (walk before the cross) as we walk before the cross. 
 May Your glory fill the whole earth, as the water over sea, yes. 
 From the mountain to the valley, hear our praises rise to You. 
 From the heavens 
 From the heavens to the nations, hear the singing fill the air. 
 From the mountain - spoken

 Oh, and we sing 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

 We sing, we sing 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah. 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah. 
 We sing 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah. 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah. 
 Hallelujah, (yes, we sing) Hallelujah. 
 Hear Your church

I need Your love like a desert needs the rain. 
 I need Your touch like the fire needs the flame. 
 One moment without You near, is heartache I cannot bear. 
 A lifetime with You, O Lord, is heaven I long to know. 
 Heaven, yeah 
 Come, cover me like the ocean meets the shore. 
 Shine on my life, like the morning steals the night. 
 One moment without You near, is heartache I cannot bear. 
 A lifetime with You, O Lord, is heaven I long to know. 
 One moment without You near, is heartache I cannot bear. 
 A lifetime with You, O Lord, is heaven I long to know. 
 Heaven

Let the earth rejoice. 
 See the risen King on the clouds of praise. 
 He's exalted forever. 
 We will rise to Him, Son of righteousness. 
 And the earth will shake with the glory of heaven. 
 See the heavens open wide and His glory, like a flood, fill the earth with salvation. 
 See the nations take His hand, and in righteousness they stand. 
 This is Jesus' generation, yeah. 
 We will rise to Him, Son of righteousness. 
 And the earth will shake with the glory of heaven. 
 See the heavens open wide and His glory, like a flood, fill the earth with salvation. 
 See the nations take His hand, and in righteousness they stand. 
 This is Jesus' generation.

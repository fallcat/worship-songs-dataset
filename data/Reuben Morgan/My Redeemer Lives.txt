I know He rescued my soul. 
 His blood covered my sin. 
 I believe, I believe. 
 My shame He's taken away. 
 My pain is healed in His name. 
 I believe, I believe. 
 I'll raise the banner, 
 'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave. 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives. 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives. 
 I know He rescued my soul. 
 He did - spoken 
 His blood covered my sin. 
 I believe, I believe. 
 My shame He's taken away. 
 My pain - spoken 
 My pain is healed in His name. 
 I believe, I believe. 
 I'll raise a banner - spoken 
 I'll raise the banner, 
 'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave. 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives 
 My redeemer lives, 
 Jesus - spoken 
 My redeemer lives. 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives. 
 You lift my burden. 
 I'll rise with You. 
 I'm dancing on this mountain top, 
 To see Your kingdom come. 
 My redeemer lives, 
 Come on - spoken 
 My redeemer lives. 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives. 
 That's it - spoken 
 My redeemer lives, Jesus, 
 My redeemer lives. 
 My redeemer lives, 
 He lives, He lives 
 My redeemer lives. 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives. 
 My redeemer lives, Jesus, 
 My redeemer lives, His name is Jesus. 
 My redeemer lives, Jesus, 
 My redeemer lives. 
 My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives. 
 Spoken: 
 Oh yes 
 He lives in you

Hide me now 
 Under your wings 
 Cover me 
 Within Your mighty hands 
 When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
 I will soar with You, above the storm 
 Father, You are king over the flood 
 I will be still and know You are God 
 Find rest my soul, in Christ alone 
 Know His power, in quietness and trust

Let the weak say I am strong, let the poor say I am rich. 
 Let the blind say I can see, it's what the Lord has done in me. 
 Let the weak say I am strong, let the poor say I am rich. 
 Let the blind say I can see, it's what the Lord has done in me. 
 Come on, just sing - spoken 
 Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain. 
 Hosanna, hosanna. 
 Jesus died and rose again. 
 Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain. 
 Hosanna, hosanna. 
 Jesus died and rose again. 
 Into the river - spoken 
 Into the river I will wade, there my sins are washed away. 
 From the heavens mercy streams, of the Saviour's love for me. 
 I will rise - spoken 
 I will rise from waters deep into the saving arms of God. 
 I will sing salvation songs. 
 Jesus Christ has set me free. 
 Come on, just sing - spoken 
 Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain. 
 Hosanna, hosanna. 
 Jesus died and rose again. 
 Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain. 
 Hosanna, hosanna. 
 Jesus died and rose again. 
 Hosanna, hosanna to the Lamb that was slain. 
 Hosanna, hosanna. 
 Jesus died and rose again. 
 Let the weak say I am strong, let the poor say I am rich. 
 Let the blind say I can see, it's what the Lord has done in me. 
 Hosanna 
 Let us sing hosanna to the Lord 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 To the Lamb, to the Lamb, to the Lamb

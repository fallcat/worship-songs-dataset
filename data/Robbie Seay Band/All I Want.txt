All I want is my frustation to be replaced with signs of spring 
 All I want is confirmation that you're gonna see me through this thing 
 All I want... all I want is you 
 All I want is just a window to let me know there's light outside 
 All I want is confirmation that what iim feeling isn't righrt 
 All I want is that you'd find me and I'd have nothing more to say 
 All I want is pure reflection of the one who's standing right in front of me

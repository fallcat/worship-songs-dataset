Oh, God 
 Your rescue follows close 
 I have run 
 As far has anyone could go 
 But Your love 
 Is calling me, love 
 Overwhelming, Your love 
 There's no stopping it now 
 Awaken my soul 
 Awaken my soul 
 All I've gained, I'm letting go 
 Letting go 
 Awaken my soul 
 Oh, God 
 When storms will follow close 
 And I run 
 From all I love the most 
 Then the dark 
 Is fading Your love 
 Overtaking Your love 
 It's shaken me from my sleep 
 Awaken my soul 
 Awaken my soul 
 All I've gained, I'm letting go 
 Letting go 
 Awaken my soul 
 Awaken my soul 
 All I've gained, I'm letting go 
 I'm letting go 
 Awaken me to Your love 
 There's no stopping it now, love 
 There's no stopping it now, love 
 There's no stopping it now 
 Awaken my soul 
 Every fear and every dream 
 Awaken me 
 In the season of my deepest need 
 Awaken my soul 
 Awaken my soul 
 All I've gained, I'm letting go 
 Letting go 
 Awaken my soul 
 I'm letting go 
 Awaken my soul 
 I'm 
 Awaken my soul

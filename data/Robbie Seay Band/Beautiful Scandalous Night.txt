Go on up to the mountain of mercy 
 To the crimson perpetual tide 
 Kneel down on the shore 
 Be thirsty no more 
 Go under and be purified 
 Follow Christ to the holy mountain 
 Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall 
 Cleanse your heart and your soul 
 In the fountain that flows 
 For you and for me and for all 
 At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree 
 On that beautiful, scandalous night you and me 
 Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white 
 On that beautiful, scandalous night 
 On the hillside, you will be delivered 
 At the foot of the cross justified 
 And your spirit restored 
 By the river that pours 
 From our blessed Savior's side

First of all thanks for listening to our song 
 We hope this finds you driving in your car 
 Or where ever you are breathe out and breath again 
 Know that life is hard, but its worth breathing 
 Listen to me now for love, oh love 
 It's waiting for you just to say 
 Here come better days 
 Here come better days 
 Better days, and a better place I know 
 Secondly I'm all messed up so royally 
 I stumbled my way here, but wait, oh wait 
 Grace has found me 
 Shaken up my soul 
 Grace will follow 
 Where ever you will go 
 Listen to me now grace, oh grace 
 Is calling for you just to say 
 Here come better days 
 Here come better days 
 Better days, and a better place I know 
 Green grass and I'm laying in the sunlight of you 
 The wind is moving through the trees blustering you 
 And the better days you bring, the better places found 
 Feasting at your table I'm overwhelmed 
 And I lift my glass drink to those who never gave up 
 Clouds pass fading into memories gone 
 And all I know for life is life and love and peace 
 What else could there be? 
 Here come better days, oh here come better days 
 Better days, and a better place I know

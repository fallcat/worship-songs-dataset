Take the time to start anew 
 Maybe it's in front of you 
 Take the time to walk down your street 
 And heaven knows who you might meet 
 Take the time to be okay 
 And laugh a bit along the way 
 You could take me for a ride 
 We could just drive all day 
 And we could breathe again 
 Step outside our front door 
 And gaze upon the stars 
 And know we're not alone 
 So run into the fields 
 Scream louder than you can 
 It's good to be alive 
 And breathing air again 
 Take the time to stop and stare 
 Heaven's beauty everywhere 
 Take the time to think about 
 Someone else besides yourself 
 Take the time to be okay 
 And laugh a bit along the way 
 You could take me for a ride 
 We could just drive all day

I've tasted love and I can't return 
 All my doubts and fears are burned 
 I've been set free, a rescued soul 
 I'm finally out of the cold 
 I've tasted love and I can't return 
 I'm growing old and I've been told that it won't last 
 But I've tasted love, now I can't go back 
 I have gained and I have lost 
 Joy accompanied the cost 
 I've been set free, a rescued life 
 I'm finally at home tonight 
 I've tasted love and I can't return 
 I'm growing old and I've been told that it won't last 
 I've tasted love, now I can't go back 
 I'm growing old and I've been told that it won't last 
 Oh, and let it be said, I've tasted love I will never go back 
 Love is here, calling me home 
 And now I can't return 
 Take me home 
 I will sing, I can't return 
 Love is here and it calls me home 
 I will sing, I can't return

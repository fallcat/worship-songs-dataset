I have been swept away 
 You have been pushed aside 
 I've been so consumed with me 
 You havent crossed my mind 
 But even if I ran away 
 And even if I cross the street 
 One thing will remain 
 You will always follow me 
 And I will... I will yeah, I will not be caught without you 
 Seasons will come and go 
 And life will not be the same 
 May that be true for me 
 That I will grow along the way 
 I need your presence now 
 I need your loving Grace 
 I need your comfort here 
 Leave your kiss upon my face

You are the wind rushing through the trees calling me 
 The tide that rises up, You are the sea 
 The wonder of the stars, You're heaven's spring 
 You are still, You are here close, calling us to love 
 To the ends of the earth, we sing 
 Heaven and earth will all come alive 
 To sing of Your glory that opens the skies 
 You are my day and You are my night 
 It's You that I love, You bring me to life 
 You bring me to life 
 You are the tree, spreading out your roots, digging deep 
 You've become the shade that covers me 
 Your whispering of hope is all I need 
 You are not still, You are here close, calling us to live 
 To the ends of the earth, we'll sing 
 You are the truth, everything I am is found in You 
 Everything that's old, becoming new 
 Everything old You're making new

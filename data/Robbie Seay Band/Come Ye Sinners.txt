Come ye sinners poor and needy 
 Weak and wounded sick and sore 
 Jesus ready stands to save you 
 Full of pity, love, and power 
 Come ye thirsty come and welcome 
 God's free bounty glorify 
 True belief and true repentance 
 And every grace that brings you nigh 
 I will arise and go to Jesus 
 He will embrace me in his arms 
 And in the arms of my dear saviour 
 There are ten thousand charms 
 Come ye weary heavy laden 
 Lost and ruined by the fall 
 If you tarry until you're better 
 You will never come at all 
 I will arise and go to Jesus...

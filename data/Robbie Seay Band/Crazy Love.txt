Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 Restart Your love 
 My heart, it's all been saved for You 
 Repair, not in part 
 In whole, through all that we've been through 
 And every dream that I'm feeling now 
 Every hope that remains somehow 
 If we part, I won't have the chance to say 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 You are my love 
 So far we've made it through the storm 
 They say our love 
 No way it survives the circumstance 
 But here we are and believing now 
 That our love will remain somehow 
 Crazy to even think I almost walked away 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 (Oh, it's never been easy, never safe) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 (It's enough, it's enough) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 Arms wide, You welcome me 
 Hands tied, You set them free 
 And, oh, can You hear the call to believe? 
 Is this how love goes? 
 I don't even know what this world may bring 
 Bur crazy love, everybody sing 
 Ooh, and it's all been saved for You 
 For You 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 (Crazy love) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 (Oh, it's never been easy, never safe) 
 (It's enough, it's enough) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love 
 Restart Your love 
 My heart, it's all been saved for You 
 All for You 
 Well, it's all been saved 
 Well, it's all been saved 
 Well, it's all been saved for You, for You 
 And, it's all been saved 
 Oh, it's all been saved 
 And it's all been saved for You, for You

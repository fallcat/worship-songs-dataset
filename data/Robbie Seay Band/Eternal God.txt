Forever, forever 
 You have been my home 
 Patience, patience 
 You've got all the time in the world 
 So we are more than blades of grass 
 Distant dreams fading fast 
 How long will You have us wait 
 We will wait on You 
 These days are fleeting 
 And life is hard 
 God eternal 
 Come back to us 
 And with the sun bring surprising love 
 To this day of eternal God

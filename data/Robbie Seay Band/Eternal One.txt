Praise the eternal One 
 Father, Spirit, Son 
 Our hands raised 
 We will praise 
 The eternal One 
 Praise to You our King 
 From our souls we sing 
 Our hands raised 
 We will praise 
 The eternal One 
 Let the whole world sing 
 Hallelujah 
 You have saved us 
 You have changed us 
 You have set us free 
 Liberating King 
 Praise the God of hope 
 Spirit draw us close 
 Our hands raised 
 Forever praise 
 The God of hope 
 Raise your voice now 
 Louder still 
 Let the people sing 
 Raise your voice 
 Louder still 
 Let the nations scream 
 Raise your voice louder still 
 Let it go, let it build 
 Sing, sing

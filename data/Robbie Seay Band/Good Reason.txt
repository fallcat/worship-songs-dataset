We have good reason to celebrate 
 Good reason to sing out loud 
 Good reason to dance for joy 
 Good reason 
 (Repeat) 
 Sing people sing 
 Dance people dance 
 He wants to hear from you 
 (2x) 
 Let the hands of his people 
 Be raised in joy 
 Let the feet of his people dance forever 
 Let their voice speak truth to all the world 
 Speak with your lives 
 He wants to hear from you

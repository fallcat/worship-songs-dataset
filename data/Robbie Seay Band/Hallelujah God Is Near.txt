God's resplendent glory full 
 On display for all to see 
 God creator, God of hope 
 Beautiful redeeming grace 
 Healer of the broken down 
 Of the orphans and oppressed 
 Find Him dining with the poor 
 Find Him here surrounding 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 From oceans depth to cedar trees 
 Fields of wheat along the plains 
 Praise to God from all the earth 
 Praise Him from the mountaintops 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 His radiance is greater than 
 Anything on earth and sky 
 Stars and moon will guard the night 
 Shining to the God on high 
 Let true love break out in praise 
 Let it dance and praise His name 
 All creation join to sing 
 Hallelujah to the king 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 Hallelujah, God is near 
 We love, oh, we love You 
 We sing, oh, we sing to You 
 We shout Hallelujah 
 We shout Hallelujah

My heart is beating faster in my chest 
 As I sing of where my loyalties will rest 
 To never wait on the governments to move 
 As the broken and the poor cry out for You 
 For the kingdom and the King 
 For His glory, we will sing 
 For the rescue of our souls 
 He has come 
 For the kingdom and the cross 
 Oh, the triumph and the loss 
 Love has broken through 
 And now redeemed 
 For the kingdom and the King 
 Oh, God, may we be focused on the least 
 A people balancing the fasting and the feast 
 A call to give and to serve and celebrate 
 For You are great, oh, my God, You are great 
 So I pledge to know 
 And love You above all 
 May we be the hands 
 To free them we are called 
 For the kingdom and the King 
 For His glory, we will sing 
 For the rescue of our souls 
 He has come 
 For the kingdom and the cross 
 Oh, the triumph and the loss 
 Love has broken through 
 And now redeemed 
 And our hope is not in this land 
 Oh, not in these laws 
 Not in these things 
 And we rest, oh, knowing Your love 
 Has called us to move 
 Called us to sing, sing, sing 
 And the people will sing 
 They will sing, sing 
 Oh, the people will sing 
 For the King, for the King 
 For the kingdom and the King 
 For His glory, we will sing 
 For the rescue of our souls 
 He has come 
 For the kingdom and the cross 
 Oh, the triumph and the loss 
 Your Love's broken through 
 And now redeemed 
 Oh, for the kingdom and the King 
 For His glory, we will sing 
 For the rescue of our souls 
 He has come 
 Oh, for the kingdom and the cross 
 Oh, the triumph and the loss 
 Your Love's broken through 
 And now redeemed 
 For the King and the King 
 The King, the King 
 The people will sing, sing, sing 
 For the kingdom and the King 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh

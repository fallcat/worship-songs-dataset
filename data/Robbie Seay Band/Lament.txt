We've seen mothers bury sons 
 And we're begging You to come 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 The broken fill our towns 
 And the hopeless shout aloud 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 We cannot wait 
 We cannot wait 
 Oh, we cannot wait 
 When the poor are thrown aside 
 The sick are left to die 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 We need Your grace, oh, God 
 Your grace, oh, God 
 We need Your grace 
 We cannot wait, oh, God 
 Your grace, oh, God 
 We need Your grace 
 Oh, la, la, la, oh, oh, oh 
 La, la, sing, oh, oh, oh 
 We've seen mothers bury sons 
 And we're begging You to come 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 The broken fill our towns 
 And the hopeless shout aloud 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 We cannot wait 
 We cannot wait 
 Oh, we cannot wait 
 While the poor are thrown aside 
 The sick are left to die 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 We need Your grace, oh, God 
 Your grace, oh, God 
 We need Your grace 
 We cannot wait, oh, God 
 On Your grace, oh, God 
 We need Your grace 
 Sing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Sing out, oh, oh, sing, oh, oh, oh 
 Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh

 We've seen mothers bury sons 
 And we are begging You to come 
 We are begging You to come

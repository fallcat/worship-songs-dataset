Oh God You are a mystery 
 We crowd the streets in hopes to see 
 The Son of Man before our eyes 
 His holiness uncompromised 
 Oh God we have a history 
 The saints who told of Calvary 
 And the martyrs who laid down their lives 
 For the cause of Christ were sacrificed 
 Let our faith be not alone 
 (Let our faith be not alone) 
 May our hearts be not of stone 
 (May our hearts be not of stone) 
 Give us souls that never close 
 (Give us souls that never close) 
 To the grace that You bestow 
 (To the grace that You bestow) 
 May our eyes be quick to see 
 (May our eyes be quick to see) 
 That You are here, You've come to rescue me 
 You are here, You've come to rescue me

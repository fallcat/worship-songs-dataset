Take my hand, love, take my soul as yours 
 We can clear the field that's grown between our love 
 If I take the fall, could we decide 
 To lay our fears aside? 
 It's a long way home but hope's around the bend 
 Long way home but love will sound again 
 Like winter's cold yields unto the spring 
 We'll find our way back home 
 I can see the valleys you have crossed 
 I wish I could rewind the love and time we lost 
 But it brings us here, can we decide 
 To leave our fears behind? 
 It's a long way home but hope's around the bend 
 Long way home but love will sound again 
 Like winter's cold yields unto the spring 
 We'll find our way back 
 Stars shine, would you climb the mountain? 
 Life is here before us 
 Even though the winds blow storms will not define us 
 Take my hand and soul 
 And we will find our way back home 
 It's a long way home but hope's around the bend 
 Long way home but love will sound again 
 Like winter's cold yields unto the spring 
 We'll find our way

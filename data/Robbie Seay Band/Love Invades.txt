Your love invades, I'm amazed 
 At all the ways You love me 
 Like the stars, too numerous to claim 
 You shine so very far 
 Oh, love invade, un-contained 
 Surround me in the morning 
 Like the dawn, too luminous to gaze 
 I yield to who You are 
 'Cause there is no denying You 
 Here we go, here we go, we believe it 
 Here we go, raise your voice now and sing it 
 For love, for love, we will praise 
 Your love invades, I can't escape 
 All the ways You love me 
 You remain, no matter what I've done 
 You always stay the same 
 'Cause there is no denying You 
 There is no denying You, oh, You, oh, oh 
 Here we go, here we go, we believe it 
 Here we go, raise your voice now and sing it 
 For love, for love, we will praise 
 Here we go for the hope, we believe it 
 Here we go, all we know is to sing it 
 For love, for love, we will praise 
 In the dark of night, You invite the moon to fly 
 And the stars they climb 
 In the break of day, night is slowly giving way 
 Tell the sun to rise 
 In the evening calm, You're painting with the setting sun 
 My heart stops, I am listening 
 In the stillness here, everything is coming clear 
 I hear You clear 
 We can hear You clear 
 Oh, here we go, here we go, we believe it 
 Here we go, raise your voice now and sing it 
 For love, for love, we will praise 
 Here we go for the hope, we believe it 
 Here we go, all we know is to sing it 
 For love, for love, we will praise 
 We will praise You 
 We will praise You

It's a big world, we are hoping 
 For a big change, we are broken 
 In the fading light of a dying sun 
 We cry for redemption 
 There is hope, there is hope, there is hope 
 But everyone who's lost will be coming home 
 And everything that hurts will be whole again 
 And love will be the last thing standing 
 Can't stop, you can't stop the seasons 
 Don't stop, don't stop believing 
 Keep on dreaming of the day when it all will change 
 Believe in the end, love wins 
 If you're waiting for the time when your sun will shine 
 Oh, look above cause love wins 
 If it hurts you, just breathe in 
 When it pains you, just believe in 
 The radiant light of the morning sun 
 We can find our redemption 
 Love is strong, love is strong, love is strong 
 It's been there holding you all along 
 Everything thrown away will be new again 
 And love will be the last thing standing 
 There is hope, there is hope for my lonely soul 
 There is hope, there is hope to be made whole 
 There is life, there is life to be set free 
 There is life there is life surrounding me 
 There is hope, there is hope for my broken heart 
 There is hope, there is hope for a brand new start 
 There is life, there is life give me eyes to see 
 There is life, there is life you have captured me

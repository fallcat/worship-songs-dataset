Our creator 
 Our redeemer 
 Our maker and merciful king 
 (2x) 
 Who is like you O God 
 Who is like you O God 
 Merciful king 
 You are enough 
 Merciful king 
 You are my love 
 Restore my soul 
 You are enough 
 Redeeming creator 
 Save us o maker 
 Merciful king 
 Where oceans are shores 
 You are my love 
 Where skies become ground 
 You are my love 
 Where souls are restored 
 And mercy is born 
 You are my love... you are my love

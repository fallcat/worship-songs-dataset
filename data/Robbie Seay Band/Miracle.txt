Have you ever had a dream 
 So big, no one else could see 
 But you believed it was possible to be 
 Anything you wanted to 
 Believe me when I say 
 You are not alone today 
 Oh, I have been there too 
 When the whole world seems 
 To turn its back on me 
 All alone out on the sea 
 I need a miracle, I need a miracle 
 When life don't seem 
 To make sense at all 
 I believe You hear me when I call 
 I need a miracle, I need a miracle 
 Have you ever stared death in the face 
 So close you could hardly breathe in 
 And you cry out to God 
 For mercy to prevent the fall 
 There are very few words to say 
 When you can't see another day 
 Oh, and my heart beats again 
 Oh, when the whole world seems 
 To turn its back on me 
 All alone out on the sea 
 I need a miracle, I need a miracle 
 When life don't seem 
 To make sense at all 
 I believe You hear me when I call 
 I need a miracle, I need a miracle 
 When the lights all seem 
 To come crashing down 
 All alone, no one around 
 I need a miracle, I need a miracle 
 When life don't seem 
 To make sense at all 
 I believe You hear me when I call 
 Oh, I believe, I believe 
 And I believe 
 Though I can't see, oh 
 Now I believe, I believe 
 And I believe 
 I still believe 
 And when the whole world seems 
 To turn its back on me 
 All alone out on the sea 
 A miracle, oh, God I need a miracle 
 When life don't seem 
 To make sense at all 
 You always hear me when I call 
 I need a miracle, oh, God I need a miracle 
 When the whole world seems 
 To turn its back on me 
 All alone out on the sea 
 I need a miracle, I need a miracle 
 When life don't seem 
 To make sense at all 
 I believe You hear me when I call 
 I need a miracle, oh, I need a miracle 
 Oh, and I have been there too 
 Believe, believe 
 Oh, oh, oh, and I have been there too 
 Believe

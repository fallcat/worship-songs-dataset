The air is cold 
 I'm aware of you more than yesterday 
 Autumn leaves on winter's ground 
 I'm aware of you more than yesterday 
 Stars of light upon the sky 
 I'm aware of you more than yesterday 
 Silence falls 
 I'm aware of you more than yesterday 
 You are more beautiful today 
 And your offering of grace 
 Is calling me away to you 
 I am not the same 
 You never change 
 I am drawn to you 
 I am drawn to you

I'm gonna sing this song 
 To let you know that you're not alone 
 And if you're like me 
 You need hope, coffee, and melody 
 So sit back down 
 Let the world keep spinning 'round 
 For yesterday's gone and today is waiting on you to show your face 
 It might not be 
 The prettiest thing that you'll ever see 
 But it's a new day, oh baby, it's a new day 
 And it might not look like 
 A beautiful sunrise 
 But it's a new day, oh baby, it's a new day 
 I'm a pilgrim soul 
 I've traveled far and come back home 
 This land is hard and cold 
 For those who long to love 
 And I know it might seem 
 That the world is crumbling 
 But it's me and you dancing in the kitchen at 2 am 
 And we're still alive 
 It's the calm of the storm that comes blowing in 
 It's the springtime saying I'm back again 
 The clouds that roll by 
 Crossing moonlight 
 Me and you love - everything's all right 
 Standing in the rain with nowhere to go 
 Laughing and we're spinning and I hope that you 
 Remember this day 
 For the rest of your life 
 Me and you love - everything's gonna be all right 
 And it just might be 
 The prettiest thing that you'll ever see 
 It's a new day 
 Oh baby, it's a new day 
 If you look outside 
 To see a beautiful sunrise 
 It's a new day

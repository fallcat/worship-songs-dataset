I cannot boast in anything 
 But Jesus Christ, my God and King 
 I cannot call this world my home 
 It's Heaven that I'm longing for 
 And in Your presence I am free 
 Oh, great love, My God and King 
 Singing, oh, great love, my God and King 
 We praise You as One, your kingdom come, oh great love 
 In the quiet Jesus speaks 
 I hear him calling out to me 
 Oh, all that you hold tightly now 
 Let it go, just lay it down 
 And in the stillness I am free 
 And in your presence I am free 
 Oh, great love, My God and King 
 Singing, oh, great love, my God and King 
 We praise You as One 
 Your kingdom come, oh great love 
 You are faithful, you are faithful 
 Oh God, faithful, you are faithful 
 You are faithful, oh God 
 You are faithful, oh God 
 And in the stillness I am free 
 And in your presence I am free 
 Oh, great love, My God and King 
 Singing, oh, great love, my God and King 
 We praise You as One, we praise you as One 
 Your kingdom come, oh great love

Oh, love that will not let me go 
 I rest my weary soul in Thee 
 I give You back this life I owe 
 And in Your ocean depths, its flow 
 May richer, fuller be 
 Oh, light that follows all my way 
 I yield my flickering torch to Thee 
 And my heart restores its borrowed ray 
 And in Your sunshine's blaze, its day 
 May brighter, fairer be 
 And rejoice, my heart 
 Rejoice, my soul 
 My Savior God has come to thee 
 Rejoice, my heart 
 You've been made whole 
 By a love that will not let me go 
 Oh, joy that seeks me through the pain 
 I cannot close my heart to Thee 
 I chase the rainbow through the rain 
 And feel the promise is not vain 
 That mourn shall tearless be 
 Saying rejoice, my heart 
 Rejoice, my soul 
 My Savior God has come to thee 
 And rejoice, my heart 
 You've been made whole 
 By a love that will not let me go 
 It's a love that will not let me go 
 Oh, cross that lifts and holds my head 
 I dare not ask to fly from thee 
 I lay in dust life's glory dead 
 And from the ground, their blossoms red 
 Life that shall endless be 
 Rejoice, my heart 
 Rejoice, my soul 
 My Savior God has come to thee 
 And rejoice, my heart 
 You've been made whole 
 By a love that will not let me go 
 (A love that will not let me go) 
 Oh, rejoice, my heart 
 (Rejoice, my heart) 
 Rejoice, my soul 
 (Rejoice, my soul) 
 My Savior God has come to thee 
 (My Savior God has come to thee) 
 And rejoice, my heart 
 You've been made whole 
 By a love that will not let me go 
 It's a love that will not let me go 
 Oh, a love that will not let me go

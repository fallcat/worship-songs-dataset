Pass me not o gently saviour 
 Hear my humble cry 
 While on others thou art calling 
 Do not pass me by 
 Trusting only in thy merit 
 Would I seek your face 
 Heal my wounded broken spirit 
 Save me by your grace 
 Thou the spring of all my comfort 
 You are more than life to me 
 Whom have I on earth besides thee 
 Whom in heaven but thee 
 Saviour sweet saviour 
 Jear my humble cry 
 While on others thou art calling 
 Do not pass me by 
 Do not pass me by

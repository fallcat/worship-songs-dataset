Calmer than the sky 
 Far away so blue 
 Land of living God 
 Grant your peace on earth 
 We can feel you move 
 And cannot stay the same 
 The winds are blowing strong 
 God of heaven come 
 Breathe peace 
 Breathe your peace on us 
 So we might breathe you deep 
 Breathe peace 
 Breathe your peace on us 
 Land of the living God 
 If we are in the way 
 Move us to the side 
 God forgive our wrongs 
 Rest your hands on us 
 All the world is yours 
 Let us not forget 
 It was you who bore the cross 
 God of comfort breathe

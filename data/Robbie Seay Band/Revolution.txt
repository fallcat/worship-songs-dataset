Spin me round in your storm 
 Knock me down 
 Blind my eyes so I can see 
 Your revolution in me 
 Drown the rhythm of my days 
 Be my constant 
 Clear my head so I can breathe 
 Your revolution in me 
 Let you change come from within 
 Plant your foolishness in me 
 Hit me at my knees with truth 
 So I might fall

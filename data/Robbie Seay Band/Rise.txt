Slow down, be still 
 Let go, we will 
 Be here, be now 
 Slow down, be still 
 Breathe in, refill 
 Be here, be now 
 If you choose to love 
 To know that the call 
 Is to give all you are 
 To give love away, away 
 Rise, rise, people of love rise 
 People of love rise, give yourself away 
 Rise, rise, people of love rise 
 People of love rise, give yourself away 
 Give yourself away, give yourself away 
 Slow down, just breathe 
 Be still, believe 
 Be here, be now 
 Slow down and see 
 It's all you need 
 Be loved and free 
 And to hear the call, is to give your love away 
 And to hear the call, is to give your love away 
 And to hear the call, is to give your life away 
 Is to give your life away 
 We're not safe, we're not safe 
 But we will rise

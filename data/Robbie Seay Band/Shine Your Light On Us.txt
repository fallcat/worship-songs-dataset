Oh, my God 
 Shine Your light on us 
 That we might live (repeat) 
 I've been holding on 
 I've been holding on 
 All that is inside me 
 Screams to come back home 
 If you feel lost 
 If you feel lost 
 Sing along 
 If you feel tired 
 If you feel tired 
 Sing along 
 If you feel lost and tired 
 This is your song (repeat second time) 
 I've been broken down 
 I've been broken down 
 I ain't giving up 
 Love will come back around 
 (Chorus 2x, repeat last 2 lines 2nd time) 
 Chorus 2x, Tag 
 Tag: 
 Shine Your light 
 Shine it down 
 Let Your rescue come for us, we long to love 
 And if you feel lost, sing along 
 And if you feel tired, sing along

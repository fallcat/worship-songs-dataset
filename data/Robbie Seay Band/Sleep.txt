Woke myself up from a dream to see you there 
 The most beautiful sight I'd seen 
 And if I could wake you now and tell you one thing 
 I'd say I'm sorry for the pain you felt 
 Sleep a peaceful sleep and we'll be okay 
 Watching you is sleep enough for me 
 And dream your dream and we'll be okay 
 Watching you is sleep enough for me 
 Sleep enough for me 
 Sleep enough for me 
 If I never loved you I'd have never lived 
 And if I never lived I'd never know your touch 
 Never known your scent and never known your smile 
 I'd never know you never know me 
 I wish I had the words that would charm the world 
 But I could speak for hours and never have loved 
 So don't let these words get in the way 
 I need you

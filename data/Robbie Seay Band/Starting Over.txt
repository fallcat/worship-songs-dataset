Clouds are gathering 
 Closing in it seems 
 Why can't I move? 
 You circle overhead 
 With Your love instead, beckoning 
 Now hope has found me 
 I am not alone 
 Now hope has found me 
 I am not disowned 
 And when I think it's over 
 I am not alone 
 When you think it's over 
 You can start it over 
 You, Your peace within my soul 
 Mercy You have shown 
 Though trials come 
 You, You're calling me to climb 
 Up this mountain side 
 Here I go, here I go 
 You calling me back home 
 It's Your voice I know, beckoning

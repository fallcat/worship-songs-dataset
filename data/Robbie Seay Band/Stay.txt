Don't leave this place 
 Don't leave this place 
 We are scared that we'll be left here all alone 
 So we fall down on our face 
 For you are the sunlight in our darkness 
 You are the truth among our lying 
 You are the life within our graves 
 Don't leave this place 
 Holy spirit stay 
 Holy spirit stay 
 Take our pride and exchange it for our grace 
 Take our pride - exchange it for your grace 
 Take our will - exchange it for your way 
 Don't leave this place

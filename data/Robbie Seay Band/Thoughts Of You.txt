Thoughts of you take over me 
 Like darkness takes the evening sky 
 And for a moment I am overcome with you 
 Make believe could never write a story so beautiful 
 Than you loving me in spite of me 
 Its more than make believe 
 Your love changes me... 
 (4x) 
 Black and white surround myworld 
 If you don't go on loving me 
 The colors of the rainbow will fade 
 Toblack and white 
 Letters that you wrote to me 
 I hide them deep within me 
 In hope that I will someday 
 Hold the hand that wrote letters to me 
 Your love changes me... 
 (4x)

You're the one who chased us 
 You're the one who started all of this 
 You're the one who dreams 
 You're the one who loves 
 So let us respond 
 Yours the voice that calls us 
 Yours the hands that hold us 
 When we have come undone 
 You're the one who loves 
 So let us respond 
 We are free... 
 We are free in You, God

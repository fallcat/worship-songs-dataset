Got brothers by my side 
 Sisters at my right 
 And hands that hold my own and won't let go 
 Got a love that won't subside 
 Leaving all my fears behind 
 And grace at every turn and so I know 
 Oh, I am not alone 
 I am not alone 
 I will ever find that You're my home 
 I am not alone 
 There's a narrow road to walk 
 That's wide enough for all 
 So lay aside the heavy doubts you bring 
 The strongest and the weak 
 Oldest and the meek 
 All meet at the cross and we will sing 
 Oh, we are not alone 
 We are not alone 
 We will ever find that You're our home 
 Oh, we are not alone 
 We are not alone 
 We will ever find that You're our home 
 We're not alone 
 'Cause You said You'd never leave us 
 And when You came and when You freed us 
 Oh, You never left us for a moment, God 
 And You never will disown us 
 When we know that You are for us 
 Well, You never leave us for a moment, God 
 The greatest and the least 
 Broken and redeemed 
 All meet at the cross and we will sing 
 We will sing, we will sing 
 We will sing, we will sing, oh 
 We are not alone 
 (We are not alone) 
 We are not alone 
 (We are not alone) 
 We will ever find that You're our home 
 (Ooh) 
 Oh, we are not alone 
 (We are not alone) 
 We are not alone 
 (We are not alone) 
 We will ever find that You're our home 
 (We're not alone) 
 We're not alone 
 Ooh, You came and You freed us 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 And You will never leave us 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 Now we are singing, oh, oh 
 And You came and You freed us 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 And You will never leave us 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 Now we are singing, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll praise my maker while I have breathe 
 And when voice is lost in death 
 Praise employs my nobler power 
 My days of praise will never be past 
 Happy those whose hopes rely 
 On Israel's God who made the sky 
 Earth and seas with all their train 
 And all the land that lies within 
 Our God pours eyesight on the blind 
 He supports the fainting mind 
 His truth forever stands secure 
 He saves oppressed and feeds the poor 
 I'll praise my God who lends me breath 
 And when my voice is lost in death 
 Praise employs my nobler powers 
 My days of praise will never be past 
 God helps the stranger in distress 
 The widowed and the fatherless 
 He grants the prisoner sweet release 
 And sends the laboring conscinece peace 
 I'll praise my God...

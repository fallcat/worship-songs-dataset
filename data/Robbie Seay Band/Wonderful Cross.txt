When I survey the wondrous cross 
 On which the Prince of Glory died 
 My richest gain I count but lost 
 And pour contempt on all my pride 
 See from His head His hands His feet 
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down 
 Did e'er such love and sorrow meet 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die and find 
 That I may truly live 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here 
 By grace draw near 
 And bless your name 
 Were the whole relem of nature mine 
 That were and off'ring far too small 
 Love so amazing so divine 
 Demands my soul my life my all 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Bids me come and die and find 
 That I may truly live 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 Oh the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here 
 By grace draw near 
 And bless your name

Heavenly Father 
 You always amaze me 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 In my world, in my life 
 You give me the food I need 
 To live through the day 
 And forgive me as I forgive 
 The people that wrong me 
 Lead me far from temptation 
 And deliver me 
 From the evil one 
 I look out the window 
 The birds are composing 
 Not a note is out of tune 
 Or out of place 
 I walk through the meadow 
 And stare at the flowers 
 Better dressed than any girl 
 On her wedding day 
 Oh, so why do I worry? 
 Why do I freak out? 
 God knows what I need 
 He know what I need 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love is strong 
 The kingdom of the heavens 
 Is now advancing 
 Invade my heart 
 Invade this broken town 
 And the kingdom of the heavens 
 Is buried treasure 
 Would you sell yourself 
 To buy the one you've found? 
 Oh, God 
 There are two things You told me 
 That You are strong 
 And You love me 
 Yes, You love me 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Strong, strong, strong 
 Our God in Heaven hallowed be 
 Thy name above all names 
 Your kingdom come, Your will be done 
 On earth as it is in Heaven 
 Give us today our daily bread 
 Forgive us weary sinners 
 Keep us far from our vices 
 And deliver us from these prisons 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love 
 Your love is strong 
 Your love is 
 Your love is 
 Your love is strong 
 Yeah, Your love is strong 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 (Your love is strong, Your love is strong) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

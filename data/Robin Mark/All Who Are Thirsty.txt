All who are thirsty 
 All who are weak 
 Come to the fountain 
 Dip your heart in the stream of life 
 Let the pain and the sorrow 
 Be washed away 
 In the waves of His mercy 
 As deep cries out to deep 
 (We sing) 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 All who are thirsty 
 All who are weak 
 Come to the fountain 
 Dip your heart in the stream of life 
 Let the pain and the sorrow 
 Be washed away 
 In the waves of His mercy 
 As deep cries out to deep 
 (We sing) 
 Come Lord Jesus come (won't You come my Lord) 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 Come Lord Jesus (Jesus) come 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 Holy Spirit come 
 Holy Spirit come 
 Come Lord 
 Holy Spirit come 
 Holy Spirit come 
 As deep cries out to deep 
 As deep cries out to deep 
 As deep cries out to deep, we sing... 
 Come Lord Jesus come (won't You come, won't You come, Lord) 
 Come Lord Jesus (Jesus) come 
 Oh, come Lord Jesus (the Spirit and the Bride say) come 
 (Come Lord, come Lord) 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 Come, Lord Jesus come 
 Oh, come Lord Jesus come

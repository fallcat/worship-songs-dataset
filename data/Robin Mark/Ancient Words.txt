Holy words long preserved 
 For our walk in this world 
 They resound with God's own heart 
 Let the ancient words impart 
 Words of life, words of hope 
 Give us strength help us cope 
 In this world wherever we roam 
 Ancient words will guide us home 
 Ancient words ever true 
 Changing me, changing you 
 We have come with open hearts 
 The faithful words of Christ 
 Holy words long preserved 
 For our walk in this world 
 They resound with God's own heart 
 Oh let the ancient words impart 
 We have come with open hearts 
 Oh let the ancient words impart 
 Oh let the ancient words impart

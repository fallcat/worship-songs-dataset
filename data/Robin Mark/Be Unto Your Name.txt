We are a moment You are forever 
 Lord of the ages God before time 
 We are a vapor You are eternal 
 Love everlasting reigning on high 
 Holy Holy Lord God Almighty 
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain 
 Highest praises Honor and Glory 
 Be unto Your name 
 Be unto Your name 
 We are the broken You are the healer 
 Jesus Redeemer Mighty to save 
 You are the love song we'll sing forever 
 Bowing before You blessing Your name

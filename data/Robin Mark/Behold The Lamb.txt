Oh behold the Lamb 
 Wounded and dying 
 For those who crucified Him 
 Oh behold the Lamb 
 Holy Lamb of God 
 Oh behold the Lamb 
 Slain for the nations 
 This fallen creation 
 Oh behold the Lamb 
 Holy Lamb of God 
 Oh behold the Lamb, empty the third day the grave where my Lord lay 
 Oh behold the Lamb, Risen Lamb of God 
 Proclaim release onto the captives, and to the blind that they shall see 
 For I will clothe in Zion all who seek my face with the garments of praise and the 
 Robe of righteousness 
 Risen King of Glory 
 I your servant am 
 Unto my Lord be the power and the glory, oh behold the Lamb 
 Oh behold the Lamb, Coming in glory the nations before You 
 Oh behold the Lamb, Conquering Lamb of God 
 Open the gates of the strongholds, the King of Glory enters in 
 Fallen fallen are you great Babylon, for the victory is won by the power of the Son 
 Satan, you are vanquished, by this Son of Man 
 All men and angels fall down on their faces, oh behold the Lamb

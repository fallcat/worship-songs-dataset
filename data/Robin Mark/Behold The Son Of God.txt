Behold the Son of God 
 Who dies upon the cross 
 Suffering my punishment 
 Sacrifice of grace 
 Though He dies 
 Yet shall He live forever 
 And here we stand oh God 
 As trophies of Your grace 
 Drawn from darkness into light 
 Of Your Spirit born 
 Though we die 
 Yet shall we live forever 
 There is no condemnation now for those 
 Who put their trust in You alone 
 We worship You oh Son of God 
 There is no separation from His love 
 No pow'r on earth or heights above 
 Can take us from You Son of God 
 Behold the Son of God 
 Who sits upon the throne 
 Over death victorious 
 Heaven's Prince of Peace 
 Though He died 
 Yet shall He live forever 
 And we shall stand O Lord 
 Before that throne of grace 
 Bought by Your redeeming love 
 Purchased by the blood 
 Though we die 
 Yet shall we live forever

Lead me Lord, once more to Calvary 
 To that hill of sacrifice that changed the world for me 
 Mercies flow from that abandoned place 
 Where the weak, the poor and broken find eternal grace 
 Who am I, that I this love receive? 
 Who is He, with mercies ever free? 
 No remains of robe or cruel crown 
 Even cross and nails have faded with the blood stained ground 
 Earth and clay, in death could not contain 
 Author of the life eternal, when You rose again 
 Elohim, Yeshua, Adonai 
 Jesus Christ the Lord and God of all 
 Lead me Lord, once more to Calvary 
 To that hill of sacrifice that changed the world for me

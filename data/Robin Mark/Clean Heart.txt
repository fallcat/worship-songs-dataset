Holy are you Lord, and holy are Your ways 
 Yet, in Love's regard, how easily I stray 
 Come renew my mind, make my heart more pure 
 May my life be wholly yours 
 Nothing is my own, so nothing can I bring 
 Simple words alone, the praises that I sing 
 Might this worship song, from a contrite heart 
 Now reveal your mercy Lord 
 Higher than the Heavens above 
 Deeper than the sea 
 Is all my Fathers love 
 Is all my Fathers love 
 To me 
 Soft the words I hear, now whispered from on high 
 Sweet Your mercies fall on every wandering child 
 O what love is this, oh what power of grace 
 Changing me to greater things

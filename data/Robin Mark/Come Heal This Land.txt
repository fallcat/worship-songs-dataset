Let the exile come, let the stranger come 
 Let the weary come find rest all you homeless sons 
 All you widowed ones, all you poor and dispossessed 
 For a table waits in Your Father's house 
 There the meek can come and eat 
 ThereÂ¹s a place of rest at Your Father's breast 
 Where His mercy is complete 
 Does a cry ring out from a broken nation 
 From a people who have been brought low 
 Was pride in our hearts, did we grieve Your Spirit 
 Have we blocked the ancient wells that flowed 
 Here is our covenant prayer 
 Who call upon Your name 
 We humble ourselves before You 
 We humble ourselves 
 Come heal this land, come heal this land 
 Come heal this land, come heal this land 
 Do the tears of One who gave all things for us 
 Do they fall from Heaven still because of us 
 For we have tasted grace and we have known Your mercy 
 But we have not shown this grace to men 
 Here is our covenant prayer 
 Who call upon Your name 
 We humble ourselves before You 
 We humble ourselves 
 May this land we love be a place of safety 
 Be a light for all the nations of this earth 
 May Your streams of love, may they flow here freely 
 Here where every stranger finds a home 
 Here is our covenant prayer 
 Who call upon Your name 
 We humble ourselves before You 
 We humble ourselves 
 Come heal this land

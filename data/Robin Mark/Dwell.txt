Jesus, You are fairest 
 Fairest of ten thousand 
 Beauty that's beyond compare 
 When the darkness falls, around me 
 And I need Your loveliness to shine 
 You're there 
 The King who laid aside His crown 
 The Savior of my life, come down 
 Oh, Dwell in us O Lord and dwell in me O Lord 
 And tune my heart to hear You 
 Let my soul draw near to hear the beating of Your heart 
 For raised from death to life 
 You are the King of Light 
 And every eye will see you 
 Every tongue confess You 
 When You come again to dwell in this place 
 And on that glorious day when clouds shall roll away and 
 The Son in all his glory 
 Oh, the wondrous story 
 Lifting us to newness of a life for evermore

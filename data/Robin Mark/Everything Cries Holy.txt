We see the Lord, and He is high upon the throne 
 And His glory fills the heavens and the earth. 
 One like a lamb who was slain is on the throne, 
 So I cast my crown before you and bow down to praise. 
 For everything cries holy, 
 O everything cries holy, 
 O everything cries holy to You Lord. 
 For everything cries holy, 
 O everything cries holy, 
 O everything cries holy to You Lord.

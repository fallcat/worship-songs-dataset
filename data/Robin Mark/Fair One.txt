Word of the Father 
 Son of the Living God 
 Ruler over Earth and Heaven 
 You are The Lover of my soul 
 Sacrificial Lamb 
 Savior of the world You made, and 
 Oh, all the work You've done 
 All because of love 
 For the world your hands have made 
 And I, I have heard your voice 
 Calling out my name 
 Calling me Beloved one, yeah 
 Such mystery is this 
 Undeserving souls 
 Turn their face away from you 
 And yet, cradle to the grave 
 You pursue their hearts 
 Never ever giving up on us, and 
 Oh, all the works You've done 
 All because of love 
 For the world your hands have made 
 And I, I have heard your voice 
 Calling out my name 
 Calling me Beloved one, yeah 
 Rise up, my fair, fair one, away with me to come 
 Forsake your former ways and find the Lover of your soul 
 Your tears shall be no more, upon that other shore 
 Your purpose with me, hope is in me, joy forevermore

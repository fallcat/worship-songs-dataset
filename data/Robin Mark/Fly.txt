If I were on eagles wings, to fly 
 Fly to the ends, of all the earth 
 I could never leave my Father's sight 
 Who knew me long before my birth 
 Author and Creator of my soul 
 You formed me in the secret place 
 Even if my heart is growing cold 
 You shower me with all Your faithfulness 
 If I were to sail the oceans wide 
 And hide myself in darkest depths 
 Even there Your love would be my light 
 Your mighty hands, my life protect 
 Surely You are good to Israel 
 To every heart, that on your mercy stands 
 As for me, my steps had almost failed 
 But none can take me from Your hands 
 Jesus You're the Lover of my soul 
 And I confess my wayward heart 
 Father You're the one who makes me whole 
 When all has broken me apart 
 Whom have I in heaven and earth but You 
 For there is nothing I desire 
 Spirit come and fill my life anew 
 And cleanse me with your holy fire 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Put on the garments of praise 
 For the spirit of heaviness 
 Let the oil of gladness flow down 
 From Your throne 
 Put on the garments of praise 
 For the spirit of heaviness 
 Your joy is my strength alone 
 My strength alone 
 Make these broken weary bones 
 Rise to dance again 
 Wet this dry and thirsty land 
 With a river 
 Lord our eyes are fixed on You 
 We are waiting 
 For Your garland of grace 
 As we praise Your name 
 Hallelujah 
 Sing hallelujah 
 To Your name 
 Hallelujah Sing hallelujah 
 We trade our sorrows 
 For garments of praise

Lift up your heads O ye gates 
 Let the King of Glory come in 
 Be lifted up oh ancient doors 
 Let the King of Glory come in 
 The altars we've built and the works we have done 
 Can never compare to the Savior's love 
 The hearts of the humble are temples of praise 
 As we worship the Ancient of Days 
 As we worship the Ancient of Days 
 Glory to the Lord our God 
 Glory to the Lamb on the throne 
 We open wide the gates of our hearts 
 With our lips we rise up and praise 
 As we worship the Ancient of Days 
 Who can ascend to the hill of the Lord 
 People of clean hearts and hands 
 You who are righteous and seeking His face 
 Come and worship the Ancient of Days 
 Come and worship the Ancient of Days

Oh the road is wide 
 And water runs on either side 
 And my shadow in the fading light 
 Is stretching out towards the night 
 Oh the sun is low 
 But I yet have still so far to go 
 And my lonely heart is beating so 
 Tired of the wandering 
 There's a sign ahead 
 Though I think it's the same one again 
 But I'm thinking about my only Friend 
 So I'll find my way home 
 When I need to get home 
 You're my Guiding Light 
 You're me Guiding Light 
 Oh the air is cold 
 And yonder lies my sleeping soul 
 By all the branches broke like bones 
 This weakened tree no longer holds 
 The night is still 
 And I have not yet lost my will 
 So I think I'll keep on moving still 
 Till I find my way home

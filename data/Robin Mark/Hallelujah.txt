You ride on a white horse scepter in hand 
 Jesus You're a warrior, holy Son of Man 
 Your eyes blaze like fire, crowns upon Your head 
 You are the Word of God, the beginning and the end 
 Hallelujah our Lord Almighty reigns 
 Jesus Christ our Savior reigns 
 Hallelujah our Lord Almighty reigns 
 Our Lord our King our God 
 Son of the highest, faithful and true 
 Lion of Judah, there is no other like You 
 King of the ages, bright and morning star 
 Wonderful counselor, all of life is in Your charge

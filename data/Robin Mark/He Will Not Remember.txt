I have searched the depths of Your great mercy 
 And there I learned the glory of Your love 
 Grace poured down right from the day You found me 
 Grace that flowed from Heaven's throne above 
 I was captive to my shame and weary 
 Lost and helpless, trapped and sinking fast 
 I cried out and, oh, You stooped to hear me 
 Opened up my future, closed my past 
 For He will not remember, and He shall not recall 
 For the former things are passed away, and He has done it all 
 Helpless in the face of Your great power 
 Speechless in the presence of Your Word 
 So amazed this broken empty vessel 
 You thought worthy of your wondrous Love 
 Who can save a wretch like me or change my fallen ways? 
 Jesus name above all names, the only One who saves

You exchanged the joy of heaven 
 For the suffering of the cross 
 And the presence of Your Father 
 For the friendship of the lost 
 Now we know there was no other way 
 To release this world from sin 
 You endured the cross, despised the shame 
 Opened heaven's gates 
 Opened heaven's gates 
 So that we might enter in 
 You took on the form of servant 
 All Your Godly glory veiled 
 For this broken world submitted 
 To the cross, the thorns, the nails 
 Now we know there was no other way 
 To release this world from sin 
 You endured the cross, despised the shame 
 Opened Heavens gates, opened Heavens gates 
 So that we might enter in 
 You opened the gates of heaven 
 You opened the gates of heaven 
 And now we're free to enter in

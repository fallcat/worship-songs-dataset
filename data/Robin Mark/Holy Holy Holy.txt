Holy, holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lord God Almighty 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy 
 Is the song around the throne 
 Where the angels and the elders gather 
 There in sweet assembly 
 Singing holy, singing holy 
 Is the Lord our God 
 Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy 
 Is the Lamb who was slain for me 
 Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy 
 Is the song within my heart 
 I could choose to spend eternity 
 With this my sole refrain 
 Singing worthy, singing worthy 
 Is the Lord our God 
 The Way, the Truth, the Life, the Light 
 The King, the great I Am 
 My life, my all, my every breath 
 The Rock on which I stand 
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus 
 How You suffered and died for us 
 Oh Jesus, oh Jesus 
 But that tomb is empty now 
 And I long to gaze upon Your throne 
 And all Your risen glory 
 Singing Jesus, singing Jesus 
 Is the Lord of all 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lord God Almighty 
 Singing holy, singing holy 
 Is the Lord our God

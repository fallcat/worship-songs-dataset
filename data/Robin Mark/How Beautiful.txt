How beautiful, how rich, how fair 
 The portals of Your temple are 
 To spend one day within your house 
 Surpasses even thousands 
 There sparrow and the swallow nest 
 Around Your altar, finding rest 
 And me in robes I do not own 
 Find grace and affirmation 
 For there a fountain flows. poured on my thirsty soul 
 Just like the Autumn rain, falls on a desert place 
 You traced Your finger in the clay 
 And my accusers melt away 
 The words You speak when we're alone 
 My heart and will compelling 
 These loaves and fishes that we bring 
 Our simple childlike offering 
 From which a banquet You prepare 
 Within your courts rejoicing

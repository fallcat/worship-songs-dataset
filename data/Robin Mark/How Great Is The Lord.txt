How great are You Lord 
 How great is Your mercy 
 How great are the things 
 That You have done for me 
 How great are You Lord 
 You loving kindness 
 Is filling my heart as I sing 
 How great are You Lord 
 How great is Your love 
 It reaches to the heavens 
 How great is the heart 
 That sought and rescued me

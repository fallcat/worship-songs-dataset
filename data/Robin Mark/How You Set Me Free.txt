When at my worst he still loves me 
 Willingly died, nailed to a tree 
 Whether I might turn, or not 
 To seek his face, He took on my sin 
 For this is how he set me free 
 My Jesus Christ, He died for me 
 He sees my weaknesses, my faults 
 He knows them all but they matter not 
 For every stain sin left on me is washed away 
 By One so clean 
 Well this is how he set me free 
 My Jesus Christ, He died for me 
 Such amazing grace 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 Such unending love, and I can't help but sing 
 Cry out for our sin has been paid for 
 Come sing of this love this great mercy 
 Sing out for our king has redeemed us 
 We share in his cross, his victory

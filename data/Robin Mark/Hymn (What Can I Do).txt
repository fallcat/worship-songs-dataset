How great a love that we have found 
 Where judgement rests and grace abounds 
 To fit us for eternal days 
 In earth and heaven sing Your praise 
 What mercy this that paid the price 
 One single work of sacrifice 
 A world in chains, Your love set free 
 And even such a one as me 
 What can I do but sing your praise 
 What can I give but thanks again 
 When all around shall fade and fall 
 Your love will triumph over all 
 What name shall hold my heart and voice 
 But One in whom all will rejoice 
 That name above all other names 
 The name of Jesus Christ who saves 
 What peace shall fill the days that pass 
 Untroubled by the battle noise 
 Though strife and toil are all around 
 To childlike rest within in Your arms 
 This is the Love that we have found 
 Your judgement rests, now grace abounds 
 You made us for eternal days 
 In earth and heaven sing Your praise

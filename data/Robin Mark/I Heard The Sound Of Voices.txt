I heard the sound of voices, from every tribe and nation 
 As they were walking, singing songs of deliverance 
 For going on before them, a little Lamb was leading 
 And I could hear Him singing songs of deliverance 
 For out of Egypt you have called Your sons, Your daughters 
 That they might be a witness to Your holy name 
 So Father I am walking, Lord can You see me walking 
 Oh my deliverer, I am following the Lamb 
 Where are the chains that bound me 
 The cords of my oppression 
 Jesus the Lamb has loosed them 
 He's my deliverance 
 My heart cries "Abba Father" 
 For He has led me to You 
 And I can hear You singing 
 Songs of deliverance 
 As for me and my house we will serve the Lord 
 As for me and my house we will serve the Lord 
 As for me and my house we will serve the Lord 
 Always

And I will walk with You 
 And I will find a way to show Your Word is truth 
 And none shall fear, but all will know 
 The measure of our Father's endless love 
 Consider all the works Your hands have made 
 The great and small, from sea to mountain range 
 The passion of our great Creator King 
 Whose glory shines in all created things 
 And on the Earth, for nation, tribe and tongue 
 Amazing grace, extends to every one 
 You love them all, it was for these you died 
 That all who call, will find eternal life 
 And I will walk with You, 
 And I will find the way to show Your Word is truth 
 And none shall fear, but all will know 
 The glory of the Father's endless love 
 Give me the faith that makes a mountain move 
 And to believe the gospel's power to save 
 To run this race, to run and not grow faint 
 And some to save, in Jesus' mighty name 
 And I will walk with You 
 And I will find the way to show your Word is truth 
 And none shall fear, but all will know 
 The glory of the Father's endless love

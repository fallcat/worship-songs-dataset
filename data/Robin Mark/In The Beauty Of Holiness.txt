In the beauty of holiness 
 We see You Son of righteousness 
 So we bring all that we possess 
 To lay at Your feet 
 In the place where Your glory shines 
 Jesus lover of all mankind 
 You have drawn us 
 With love sublime 
 To make us complete. 
 So I pause at Your gates once more 
 As my heart and spirit soar 
 And I wish I could love You more 
 My God and my King. 
 Is there tribute that I could bring 
 Was there ever a song to sing 
 That could ever express, my King 
 The work that You've done 
 Could I ever conceive of this 
 All the depths and the heights 
 And breadth of the riches 
 I now possess because of Your love.

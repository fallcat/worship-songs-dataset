All I am and have 
 And ever hope to be 
 Jesus, all for Jesus 
 All I am and have 
 And ever hope to be 
 All of my 
 Ambitions, hopes, and plans 
 I surrender these 
 Into your hands 
 All of my 
 Ambitions, hopes, and plans 
 I surrender these 
 Into your hands 
 For it's only in 
 Your will that I am free 
 For it's only in 
 Your will that I am free

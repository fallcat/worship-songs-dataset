I will see the King of Love on that glorious day 
 When this mortal body fails and my spirit sails away 
 No more fears or tears to cry, no darkness of the night 
 Ceaseless praise will lift Your name around the throne so bright 
 Heaven is my home, Hallelujah 
 I am but a stranger here on Earth 
 And I shall take my place 
 There at the Throne of Grace 
 And worship face to face 
 Heaven is my home 
 Peace at last as I behold my Savior face to face 
 Jesus Christ, the nail scarred King of Mercy Love and Grace

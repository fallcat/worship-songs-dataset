Lets go up to the place of praise 
 Where the Father pours out his grace 
 There is hope and peace and freedom from despair 
 There is grace and love in abundance there 
 Let's go up to His holy throne 
 To the one who is God alone 
 In the robes the Son of righteousness has given 
 We can join in the song at the throne of the God of Heaven 
 I was glad when they said to me 
 In the House of the Lord there is unity 
 And the sound of the Nations' song 
 Brothers in one accord, Sisters singing to the Lord 
 All the children dancing in the Kingly courts 
 Let's go up 
 Let's go up 
 Let's go up 
 Let's go up 
 Lets go up to the Temple Gates 
 Where the mercy of God awaits 
 For at God's right hand stands one who bore my shame 
 Yet he calls me friend and He knows my name

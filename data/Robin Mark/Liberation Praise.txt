All the chains that once had bound me 
 Fell away the day you found me 
 On my knees, before Your Throne 
 Prison walls around me broken 
 And the gates before me open 
 'Come away, my fairest one' 
 Singing Liberation Praise 
 Singing Liberation Praise 
 We are captives freed by grace 
 This is Liberation Praise 
 All the words of my oppressor 
 Have been silenced and shall never 
 Hold a sway upon my soul 
 On the wounds and scars that bruised me 
 You poured healing oil to soothe 
 And fade away, like memories old 
 This is Liberation Praise 
 Singing Liberation Praise 
 We are captives freed by grace 
 This is Liberation Praise 
 It was for freedom we have been set free and so we sing 
 A song of liberation to our Savior King 
 Who the Son sets free 
 Shall be free indeed 
 Singing Liberation Praise 
 All the chains that once had bound me 
 Fell away the day you found me 
 On my knees, before Your Throne

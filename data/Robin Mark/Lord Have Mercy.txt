Jesus, I've forgotten the words that You have spoken 
 Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim 
 With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom 
 Forgive me for my unbelief 
 Renew the fire again 
 Lord have mercy 
 Christ have mercy 
 Lord have mercy on me 
 I have built an altar where I worship things of men 
 I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from You 
 Now I am returning to Your mercies ever flowing 
 Pardon my transgressions 
 Help me love You again 
 I have longed to know You and Your tender mercies 
 Like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end 
 I bow my heart before You in the goodness of Your presence 
 Your grace forever shining 
 Like a beacon in the night

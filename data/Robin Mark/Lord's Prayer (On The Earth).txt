On the earth, O Lord, Your kingdom come 
 As it is in heaven, Your will be done 
 Feed and clothe us with our daily needs 
 And forgive our sins of word and deed 
 As we choose to show your love and grace 
 In forgiving wrongs against us made 
 Lead us not into temptations path 
 And deliver us from evil's grasp 
 For Thine is the Kingdom 
 The Power and the Glory 
 For ever and evermore 
 Hallowed be Thy name 
 Hallowed be Thy name 
 Hallowed be Thy name

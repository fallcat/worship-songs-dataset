My Heart will sing to you because of Your great love 
 A love so rich so pure a love beyond compare 
 The wilderness, the barren place 
 Become a blessing in the warmth of Your embrace 
 When earthly wisdom dims the light of knowing You 
 Or if my search for understanding clouds your way 
 To you I'll fly, my hiding place 
 Where revelation is beholding face to face 
 May my heart sing your praise for ever 
 May my voice lift Your name my God 
 May my soul know no other treasure, than Your love, than Your love 
 No not by might, nor even power, but by Your Spirit O Lord 
 Healer of hearts, binder of wounds, lives that are lost, restore 
 Flow through this land till every man praises Your name once more 
 You're everywhere in every place 
 In every time and every space 
 And every breath that I take You lend 
 You're the only one that satisfies 
 The only one that makes my life make sense

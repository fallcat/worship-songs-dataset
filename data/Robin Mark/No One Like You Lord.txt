You are the stone that the builders rejected 
 A rock of refuge where my pride is broken 
 A sure foundation when the sand is sinking 
 Where we are built upon like living stones. 
 There is no one else like You 
 There is no one like You Lord 
 There is no one else like You 
 Son of Man and Son of God 
 Son of Man and Son of God 
 When from the cross You to the depths descended 
 The hosts of hell conspired to make You captive 
 But every chain of sin and death You've broken 
 And triumphed over by Your mighty power. 
 I want to run the race You've set before me 
 Even to share in the suffering of the cross 
 That I might gain the prize for which You called me 
 To be with You, Son of Man and Son of God, 
 To be with You, Son of Man and Son of God. 
 Then from the earth You to the heights ascended 
 Where You are seated at Your Father's right hand 
 Forever pleading for the souls You've captured 
 Forever watching as You call us home.

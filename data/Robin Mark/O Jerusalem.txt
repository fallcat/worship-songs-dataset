O Jerusalem, how the enemy besets you 
 Your walls are broken down 
 And they lie in ruin about you 
 And the praises of our God and King no longer rise 
 And the heathen mock your holy name because of us 
 O Jerusalem, that I might rebuild your temple 
 And restore again in my Father's house His worship 
 Then the nations of the earth shall see and shall be glad 
 That the Lord our God the Mighty King Jehovah reigns 
 In my spirit Lord 
 You have placed a zeal for Zion 
 And to see restored on the earth Your holy kingdom 
 Let it come, and may Your love so burn within my heart 
 Till You come in glory to recieve Your bride and reign 
 Let it come, let it come 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Lord, let it come 
 Lord, let it come 
 Let it come, let it come 
 Let it come, and may Your love so burn within my heart 
 Till You come in glory to recieve Your bride and reign

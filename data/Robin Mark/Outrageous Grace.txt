There's a lot of pain but a lot more healing 
 There's a lot of trouble but a lot more peace 
 There's a lot of hate but a lot more loving 
 There's a lot of sin but a lot more grace 
 Oh outrageous grace, oh outrageous grace 
 Love unfurled by heaven's hand 
 Oh outrageous grace, oh outrageous grace 
 Through my Jesus I can stand 
 There's a lot of fear but a lot more freedom 
 There's a lot of darkness but a lot more light 
 There's a lot of cloud but a lot more vision 
 There's a lot of perishing but a lot more life 
 There's an enemy 
 That seeks to kill what it can't control 
 It twists and turns 
 Making mountains out of molehills 
 But I will call on my Lord 
 Who is worthy of praise 
 I run to Him and I am saved

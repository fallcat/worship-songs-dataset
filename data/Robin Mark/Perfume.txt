Touched by a wondrous love 
 Cradled in arms so strong 
 Before the world began 
 Before the stars were spun 
 Radiant beauty, how You have stolen me 
 My love is a perfume I pour at Your feet 
 What love is this, beckons me in 
 Drenches my heart in wine 
 I can but forsake all other loves 
 Now I am Yours and You are mine 
 Radiant beauty, how You have stolen me 
 My love is a perfume I pour at Your feet 
 My love is a perfume I pour at Your feet

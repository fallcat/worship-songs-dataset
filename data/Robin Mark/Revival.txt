I hear the voice of one crying, prepare ye the way of the Lord. 
 And make His paths straight in the wilderness 
 And let your light shine in the darkness 
 And let your rain fall in the desert. 
 As sure as gold is precious and the honey sweet, 
 So you love this city and you love these streets. 
 Every child out playing by their own front door 
 Every baby laying on the bedroom floor. 
 Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job 
 Every driver driving through the rush hour mob 
 I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones 
 You're going to send revival, bring them all back home 
 I can hear that thunder in the distance 
 Like a train on the edge of town 
 I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit 
 "Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down". 
 From the Preacher preaching when the well is dry 
 To the lost soul reaching for a higher high 
 From the young man working through his hopes and fears 
 To the widow walking through the veil of tears 
 Every man and woman, every old and young 
 Every father's daughter, every mother's son. 
 I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones 
 You're going to send revival, bring them all back home 
 I can hear that thunder in the distance 
 Like a train on the edge of town 
 I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit 
 "Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down". 
 Revive us, Revive us, 
 Revive us with your fire!

You are my soul's desire, I was wandering 
 I was wandering 
 Wandering all my days from my Father's house 
 From the heights to the depths Love was calling 
 Love was calling 
 Calling out to me, just to bring me home 
 Lord of the earth, the sea, the sky 
 In glory and power 
 How can it be that I'm Your child 
 And You are my Father 
 So I, oh I, I will exalt Your name again 
 Most High 
 Every way I can 
 You put songs in my mouth, I am praising 
 I am praising 
 Praising only You, for the things You've done 
 There's a flag in my hand and I am waving 
 I am waving 
 Waving it for You, just to make You smile 
 Many will see and hear and trust 
 In You our salvation 
 Many will turn and seek Your face 
 From out of all nations 
 So I, oh I, I will exalt Your name again 
 Most High 
 Every way I can

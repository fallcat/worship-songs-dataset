Take us to the river 
 Take us there in unity 
 To sing a song of Your salvation 
 To win this generation for our King 
 A song of Your forgiveness 
 For it is with grace 
 That river flows 
 Take us to the river 
 In the city of our God 
 Take us to the throne room 
 And give us ears 
 To hear the cry of Heaven 
 For that cry is mercy 
 Mercy to the fallen sons of men 
 Mercy it has triumphed 
 Triumphed over judgement 
 By Your blood 
 Take us to the throne room 
 In the city of our God 
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us 
 This is the year of the Lord 
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us 
 This is the year of the Lord 
 Take us to the mountain 
 Lift us in the shadow of Your hand 
 Is this Your mighty angel 
 Who stands astride the ocean and the land 
 In His hand Your mercy showers 
 O'er a dry and barren place 
 Take us to the mountain 
 In the city of our God 
 For the Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us 
 This is the year of the Lord 
 For the Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us 
 This is the year of the Lord 
 Take us to the river 
 In the city of our God

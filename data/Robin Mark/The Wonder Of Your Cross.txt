The wonder of your cross shall be our meditation 
 To gather in that shadow when the sun went down 
 To weep with those who thought that you were leaving, 
 You were leaving, Jesus 
 The humble King who never wore an earthly crown. 
 To steal away at night when they took down your body. 
 With love and tears to leave You in a borrowed grave 
 To go with Mary to the place they laid You, 
 Where they laid You, Jesus 
 And in the morning find the stone was rolled away 
 The cross, O the wonderful cross 
 What Glory, what victory, I've found 
 I'll come to the wonderful cross 
 And my whole life I lay down 
 Were heaven's praises silent in those hours of darkness? 
 Your Holy Spirit brooding round that empty throne? 
 Until the declaration "He is Risen", You are risen, Jesus, 
 "He is not dead, behold He lives for evermore

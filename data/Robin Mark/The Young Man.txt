On a Friday evening as the sun went down 
 The body of a man who wore a thorn made crown 
 Was carried to a graveyard in the fading light 
 And laid with deep affection in a garden 
 Up on the hill the shadow of his gallows fell 
 And faded as the sun descended lower still 
 The ground was worn and bare where many feet had trod 
 To watch the execution of the young man 
 And what of me, so distant from that far, gone, place 
 Still the wonder of that moment crosses time and space 
 With mystery and majesty none can explain 
 For it draws me to the story of the young man 
 The next day being Sabbath, was a day of rest 
 And one of some reflection for the young man's friends 
 No longer messianic zeal consumed their hearts 
 Just sorrow for the killing of the young man 
 Maybe some type of guitar sound added 
 And I suppose some tears were shed till sleep came last 
 Then rising early morning once the Sabbath passed 
 A woman made her way to find the garden tomb 
 To leave her oil and flowers for the young man 
 Now history tells of heavy stone to bar the way 
 Was fixed by many soldiers on the open grave 
 For when she found it rolled aside and emptied tomb 
 She grieved the stolen body of the young man 
 A gardener called her by her name as she kneeled down 
 And asked her why she searched about the burial ground 
 And wiping bitter tears away with the dawns first light 
 She saw the risen glory of the young man

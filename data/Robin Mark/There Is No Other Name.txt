There is no other name 
 By which man can be saved 
 There is no other name under Heaven 
 There is rest for my soul 
 And the wounded made whole 
 And the captives set free and forgiven 
 Such love as I've never known 
 I've found in the grace that flowed to me 
 In my unrighteousness 
 This is why my heart and soul 
 And tongue confess

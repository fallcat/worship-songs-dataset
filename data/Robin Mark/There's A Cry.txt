There's a cry that is rising from the depths of creation 
 There's a call on the lips of every people, every nation 
 It's the cry of the children for the Father's heart 
 It's the call of the lost sheep for the Shepherd's voice 
 Hear their cry from the depths O Lord 
 Hear their cry from the depths O Lord 
 Like a tree by a river, giving fruit in due season 
 And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations 
 You have planted a kingdom that shall never fall 
 To the ends of the earth is Your salvation call 
 Hear their cry from the depths O Lord 
 Hear their cry from the depths O Lord 
 Those who weep, return with songs of joy 
 You have turned their mourning into dancing 
 Those who seek, shall find the Lord of Lords 
 Jesus Christ, desire of all the nations 
 As a watchman is waiting, for the sun in it's dawning 
 As his heart is rejoicing at the light of the morning 
 So my soul waits for You and Your unfailing love 
 For the Lord our Redeemer has become their hope 
 Hear their cry from the depths O Lord 
 Hear their cry from the depths O Lord 
 Your Kingdom, Your Name, and 
 Your Throne will last forever

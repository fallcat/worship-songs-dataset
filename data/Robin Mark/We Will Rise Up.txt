I'll proclaim the glory of the works that You have done 
 Grace for every passing day and hope for days to come 
 Draw me from all selfish ways, my needs and my desires 
 Fix my eyes upon the cross and set my heart aside 
 Should I boast in anything, in wisdom or in gain? 
 I will boast in Jesus Christ, His glory and his name! 
 All the riches of this world mean nothing now to me 
 To the love of Him who died to set this captive free 
 We will rise up, we will rise up and exalt you, we exalt you 
 We will rise up, we will rise up and exalt you, we exalt you 
 Should I trade your sacrifice for silver or for gold? 
 When my heart is satisfied in knowing You alone 
 All that I will ever own I count it all as loss 
 For the knowledge of you name, the wonder of the cross

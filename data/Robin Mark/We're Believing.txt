There's a song of praise on our lips 
 There's a song of joy in our hearts 
 And we're believing, we're believing 
 Believing that the promise is true 
 Living out a life that is new 
 We're believing in You 
 Earth below and heavens above 
 Praise you for Your unfailing love 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Higher than the heavens and sky 
 Deeper than the great oceans wide 
 Hallelujah, Your Love 
 The Lamb of God once slain before the world was made 
 Has turned our mourning into dancing once again 
 Knowing that the Promise is true 
 Knowing that our hope is in You 
 We're believing, still believing 
 Telling of the love we have found 
 Living lives that You turned around 
 Still believing in You 
 The Alpha and Omega, God's anointed Son 
 This world will praise you for the works that you have done 
 We're believing in You 
 We're believing in You 
 We're believing in You

Let the weak say I am strong 
 Let the poor say I am rich 
 Let the blind say I can see 
 It's what the Lord has done in me 
 Let the weak say I am strong 
 Let the poor say I am rich 
 Let the blind say I can see 
 It's what the Lord has done in me 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 Jesus died and rose again 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 Jesus died and rose again 
 Into the river I will wade 
 There my sins are washed away 
 From the heavens mercy streams 
 Of the Savior's love for me 
 I will rise from waters deep 
 Into the saving arms of God 
 I will sing salvation songs 
 Jesus Christ has set me free 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 Jesus died and rose again 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 Jesus died and rose again 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 To the Lamb that was slain 
 Hosanna, hosanna 
 Jesus died and rose again 
 So let the weak say I am strong 
 Let the poor say I am rich 
 Let the blind say I can see 
 It's what the Lord has done in me

Press in to the heart of the Father 
 Hold fast to the grace received 
 Breathe in the life of the Spirit 
 And with all faith believe 
 And with all faith believe 
 Believe on this 
 The Word of Life 
 Our Lord the Christ 
 Has come to save us 
 Received by faith 
 His blood supplied 
 That the power of sin be cursed 
 And the Father be glorified

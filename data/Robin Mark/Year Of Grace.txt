Just as I am one only plea 
 In that the blood once shed was shed for me 
 And drew me to a covenant place 
 Where I found mercy in the year of grace 
 No condemnation now for me 
 Your Word has touched my heart and now I see 
 In Heaven stands to plead my case 
 The One who found me in the year of grace 
 O Son of God sweet Son of Man 
 The Author of redemption's plan 
 Eternal God in time and space 
 O keep me ever in the year of grace 
 I hear Your voice my soul awakes 
 Your whispered words have stirred my heart to praise 
 On love unbound I fix my gaze 
 Where I first saw You in the year of grace 
 In life in death whom shall I fear 
 Closer than breath I feel You near 
 Oh hold me in Your strong embrace 
 Where I find rest within the year of grace

This world is broken, a ship with no anchor 
 Sailing through space always uncharted waters 
 Yet we seem to know where we want to go 
 But we don't know why we're here 
 Millions get lost on their own little journey 
 Some only stay for a few passing moments 
 And the only thing that we know for sure 
 Is some day our journey ends 
 But You said You are 
 The resurrection and the life 
 And whoever believes in you shall never die 
 And you said, that by Your word and power 
 Even though we die, we'll live forevermore 
 And I believe, I believe, I believe in You 
 You are the way, You are the truth, You are the life everlasting 
 You are the light, You are the word, You are the Son of the Father

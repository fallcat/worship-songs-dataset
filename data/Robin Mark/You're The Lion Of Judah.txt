You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb that was slain, 
 You ascended to heaven and ever more will reign; 
 At the end of the age when the earth You reclaim, 
 You will gather the nations before You. 
 And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb 
 Who was crucified, 
 For with wisdom and mercy and justice You'll reign 
 At Your Father's side. 
 And the angels will cry: 'Hail the Lamb 
 Who was slain for the world, Rule in power.' 
 And the earth will reply: 'You shall reign 
 As the King of all kings 
 And the Lord of all lords.' 
 There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side, 
 There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied; 
 As the Father has told us for these You have died, 
 For the nations that gather before You. 
 And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb 
 Who was crucified, 
 Who descended to hell yet was raised up to reign 
 At the Father's side.

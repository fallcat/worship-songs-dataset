Your banner over me is Love 
 Your banner over me is Love 
 Love found me as a wandering child 
 Love saved me out of death to life 
 Your banner over me is Love 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Each day you're gonna find me there 
 I wouldn't spend it anywhere 
 Than in your presence in Your house 
 O Lord God Almighty 
 Minister of Grace 
 Blessed are those on Zion's hill 
 Singing out Your Praise 
 You're my beginning and my end 
 You're my beginning and my end 
 This journey may be short or long 
 These words will always be my song 
 You're my beginning and my end 
 You're my beginning and my end 
 You're my beginning and my end

As for me and my house 
 We will serve the Lord (oh yes) 
 As for me and my house 
 We will serve the Lord 
 We have counted the cost 
 We have made the choice 
 We will follow our God 
 And obey His voice 
 From this day 
 For the rest of our lives 
 We will serve the Lord 
 We will not bow to another God 
 We will have no other God's refuge 
 We will not serve two masters 
 We surrender our lives to You 
 We surrender our lives to You

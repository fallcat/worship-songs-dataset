Enter His gates with thanksgiving 
 Come into His courts with praise 
 Enter His presence rejoicing 
 Singing great and mighty is His name 
 Praise Him with 
 The sound of the trumpet 
 Praise Him with 
 The timbrel and harp 
 Let every creature 
 In Heaven and earth 
 Lift a sound of praise 
 Sing with all their heart 
 For the Lord is good 
 (For the Lord is good) 
 For the Lord is good 
 (For the Lord is good) 
 For the Lord is good 
 And His mercy 
 Endures forever 
 For the Lord is good 
 (For the Lord is good) 
 For the Lord is good 
 (For the Lord is good) 
 For the Lord is good 
 And His mercy 
 Endures forever 
 For the Lord is good 
 And His mercy 
 Endures forever 
 Jesus the Son is exalted 
 Maker of everything 
 Come now and bow down before Him 
 Lift your hands in praise 
 Raise your voice to sing 
 For the Lord is good 
 And His mercy endures forever

Grandma's hands clapped in church on Sunday morning 
 Grandma's hands played a tambourine so well 
 Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning 
 She'd say Ronny don't you run so fast 
 You might fall on a piece of glass 
 There might be snakes there in the grass 
 Grandma's hands 
 Grandma's hands soothed a local unwed mother 
 Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell 
 Grandma's hands used to lift a face and tell her 
 She'd say baby Grandma understands 
 That you really love that man 
 Put your faith in Jesus' hands 
 Grandma's hands 
 Grandma's hands used to hand me a piece of candy 
 Grandma's hands picked me each time I'd fall 
 Grandma's hands 
 Lord they really came in handy 
 She'd say Edith don't you whip that boy 
 What'cha wanna spank him for 
 He didn't steal that candy from no store 
 But I don't have Grandma anymore 
 When I get to heaven 
 I'm gonna look for Grandma's hands

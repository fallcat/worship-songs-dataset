I bow my knee before your throne 
 I know my life is not my own 
 I offer up this song of praise 
 To bring you pleasure Lord 
 I seek the giver not the gift 
 My heart's desire is to lift him/you high above on earthly kings 
 To bring you pleasure Lord 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Glory to the King 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Glory to the king

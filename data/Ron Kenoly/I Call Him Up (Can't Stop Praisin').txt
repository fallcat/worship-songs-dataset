If you confess the Lord, call Him up 
 If you confess the Lord, call Him up 
 If you confess the Lord, call Him up 
 If you confess the Lord, call Him up 
 If you believe in the Father 
 The Son and the Holy Ghost 
 Call Him up and tell Him what you want 
 Delight yourself in the Lord 
 And He will give you the desires of thine heart 
 Even though sometimes we stumble 
 Even though sometimes we fall 
 Call Him up and tell Him what you want 
 When trouble comes your way, call Him up 
 He'll brighten up your day, call Him up 
 When trouble comes your way, call Him up 
 He'll brighten up your day, call Him up 
 If you believe in the Father 
 The Son and the Holy Ghost 
 Call Him up and tell Him what you want 
 Can't stop praising His name 
 I just can't stop praising His name 
 I just can't stop praising His name, Jesus 
 Jesus, hallelujah 
 Jesus, praise His holy name

I see the lord, I see the lord 
 Exalted high upon the worship 
 Of the people of the earth 
 I see the lord, I see the lord 
 My eyes have seen the king 
 The lamb upon the throne 
 Who reigns forevermore 
 The train of his robe 
 Fills the temple 
 A cloud of heavenly worshipers 
 Surrounding his throne 
 We join with them now crying 
 "Holy, holy is the lamb 
 The lamb alone" 
 And ever 
 Forever and ever, forever and ever 
 Forever and ever, forever and ever 
 Forever and evermore 
 Forevermore 
 My eyes have seen the king 
 The lamb upon the throne 
 Who reigns forevermore 
 God is able

After all, after all 
 After everything I've seen 
 Thank God I still, still, still have joy 
 Through the storm 
 And the rain 
 Through heartaches and pain 
 Thank God I still, still, still have joy 
 It was down through the years 
 You know the Lord has come and dried my tears 
 Thank God I still, still, still have joy 
 Weeping may endure for a night 
 But early in the morning everything is gonna be alright 
 Thank God I still, still, still, have joy 
 I still have joy 
 I still have joy 
 I still have joy

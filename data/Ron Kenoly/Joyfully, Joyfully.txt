Joyfully, joyfully 
 We are going up 
 To dedicate our hearts 
 To the Lord 
 Joyfully, joyfully 
 We are going up 
 We come into His presence 
 With joy 
 God has said He'd dwell 
 In the praises of His people 
 He is seeking those who'll 
 Worship Him in spirit and in truth 
 With our hands lifted up 
 And our mouths filled with praise 
 With singing and dancing 
 And joy we celebrate 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 We enter His presence with 
 Joy, joy, joy 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 We dedicate our hearts 
 To the Lord

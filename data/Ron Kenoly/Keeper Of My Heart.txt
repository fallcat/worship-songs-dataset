I will come to you with praise in my mouth 
 I will worship at your throne with thanksgiving 
 Its to you that I sing 
 Proclaiming you as my king and give you glory 
 You are counseller and friend 
 The beginning and the end 
 You're the keeper of my heart 
 I will worship you in spirit and truth 
 I will lift up holy hands in your presence 
 I rejoice and I'll sing 
 And bless your wondrous name 
 And give you glory 
 You're my righteousness and joy 
 You're my savior and my Lord 
 You're the keeper of my heart 
 You are counsellor and friend 
 The beginning and the end 
 You're the keeper of my heart

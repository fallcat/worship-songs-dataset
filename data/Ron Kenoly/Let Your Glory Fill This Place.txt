The temple was finished 
 King Solomon prayed 
 The people came to see 
 Was God pleased with this place 
 Then fire fell from Heaven 
 The priest could not go in 
 God's glory was more 
 Than they could stand 
 God's glory was more 
 Than they could stand 
 Lord may Your glory 
 Fill this temple here 
 Today as You did then 
 May Your presence be 
 More than we can stand 
 Lord may Your glory fill 
 This temple as we 
 Gather in Your name 
 May Your glory 
 Fill this place 
 This place is more than 
 Brick and stone 
 This place will become a home 
 This place is for the 
 Brokenhearted everywhere 
 A place that they will find someone 
 Who cares 
 Lord in this place 
 Believers will agree 
 In this place 
 We'll stand in unity 
 In this place 
 As we gather around Your Throne 
 Lord come and make this place 
 Make it Your home 
 Lord let Your glory 
 Fill this place

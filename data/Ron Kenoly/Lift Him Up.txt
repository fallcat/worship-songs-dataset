I will come into Your presence Lord 
 With the sacrifice of praise 
 With a song I will exalt You Lord 
 Blessed be Your holy name 
 I will give You all the glory 
 You delivered me from shame 
 I'm created in Your righteousness 
 Blessed be Your holy name 
 Lift Him up 
 His name be lifted higher 
 Lift Him up 
 Exalt His holy name 
 Lift Him up 
 His name be lifted higher 
 Exalt His holy name

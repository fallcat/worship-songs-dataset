H the glory of Your presence 
 We Your temple 
 Give You reverence 
 Come and rise from Your rest 
 And be blessed by our praise 
 As we glory in Your embrace 
 As Your presence 
 Now fills this place 
 Come and rise from Your rest 
 And be blessed by our praise 
 As we glory in Your embrace 
 As Your presence 
 Now fills this place 
 Oh the glory

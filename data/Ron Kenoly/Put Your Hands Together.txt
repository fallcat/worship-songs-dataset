Everybody put your hands together and let's praise the Lord (3x) 
 The earth is His, the seas are His 
 The lands are His, our hands are His 
 Put your hands together and let's praise the Lord 
 Clap your hands all ye people 
 Sing praise to the Lord 
 Shout unto God with shouts of joy for He is Lord 
 Come on, let's put our hands together 
 And sing our praises unto our Lord (3x) 
 For God is King of heaven and earth 
 And He shall reign forevermore

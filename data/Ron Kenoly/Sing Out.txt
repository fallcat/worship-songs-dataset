Sing out 
 The Lord is near 
 Build him a temple here 
 A palace of praise 
 A throne of thanksgiving 
 Made for the King of kings 
 Sing out a joyful song 
 His love goes on and on 
 When praises abound 
 His glory surrounds us 
 Build him a temple here 
 Sing out 
 The Lord is near 
 The Lord inhabits the 
 Song of His saints 
 And lives in their paises 
 We come to worship 
 Together as one 
 With music and singing 
 Rejoice in all that the 
 Father has done 
 Let's lift up an offering

If You can use anything Lord 
 You can use me 
 If You can use anything Lord 
 You can use me 
 Take my hands, Lord 
 And my feet 
 Touch my heart, Lord 
 And speak through me 
 If You can use anything Lord 
 You can use me 
 (Repeat) 
 Lord, you called Moses 
 From the wilderness 
 And You put a rod in his hand 
 You used him to lead Your people 
 Over to the Promised Land 
 Lord, I'm willing to trust in You 
 So take my life Lord 
 And use it too 
 Yes, if You can use anything Lord 
 Come on and use me 
 When David fought Goliath 
 And that mighty giant fell 
 He proved to his people 
 That God was alive in Israel 
 Lord, I'm available to You 
 And I'm waiting to be used 
 Yes I am, Lord 
 If You can use anything Lord 
 Come on and use me 
 Take my hands and my feet 
 Touch my heart, speak through me 
 After the multitudes 
 Heard the words that Jesus said 
 He took two fish and five loaves 
 And the multitude was fed 
 Lord, what I have may not be much 
 But I know it can 
 Multiply by Your touch 
 So if You can use anything Lord 
 Come on and use me 
 (Repeat chorus two times)

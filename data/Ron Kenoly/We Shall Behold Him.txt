We shall behold him 
 The sky shall unfold preparing His entrance 
 The stars shall applaud Him 
 With thunders of praise 
 The sweet light in His eyes shall, 
 Shall enhance those awaiting 
 And we shall behold Him, then face to face 
 We shall behold Him (2x's) 
 Face to face 
 In all of His glory 
 We shall behold Him (2x's) 
 Face to face, our Savior and Lord 
 The angels will sound the shouts of His coming 
 The sleeping shall rise 
 From their slumbering place 
 And those who remain 
 Shall be changed in a moment 
 We shall behold Him, our Savior and Lord 
 We shall behold Him 
 Our Savior and Lord 
 Savior and Lord, Jesus our Lord

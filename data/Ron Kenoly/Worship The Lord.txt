I will worship the Lord, 
 For He is worthy; 
 I will lat down my sword, 
 The Prince Of Peace is His name. 
 King of the flood, 
 The Lord is mighty; 
 The Lord can quench the evil flame. 
 Peace when trouble blows, 
 Jehovah sees, Jehovah knows; 
 He is my peace, when sorrow nears, 
 Jehovah sees, Jehovah hears. 
 Feel the presence of God, 
 Upon the water, 
 Hear the voice of the Lord, 
 Within the thunder that rolls, 
 King of the flood, 
 The Lord is mighty, 
 The Lord can calm the troubled soul. 
 Peace when trouble blows, 
 Jehovah sees, Jehovah knows; 
 He is my peace, when sorrow nears, 
 Jehovah sees, Jehovah hears 
 Like the breath, 
 I need to live, 
 Jehovah takes, Jehovah gives; 
 Gives me peace, 
 When trouble blows, 
 Jehovah sees, Jehovah knows. 
 Judgement coming, He is my peace; 
 Men pursue me, He is my peace. 
 Judge! Judgement is coming, He is my peace; 
 Men pursue me, He is my peace

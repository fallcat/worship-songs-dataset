You are the love of my life 
 You are the hope that I cling to 
 You mean, more than this world to me 
 I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold 
 I wouldn't trade you for riches untold. 
 You are, you are my everything 
 I wouldn't take one step without you 
 I could never go on. 
 I couldn't breathe on breath without you. 
 I don't have the strength 
 To make it on my own 
 Until the world stops turning 
 Until the stars fade, from the sky 
 Until the sun stops striving 
 I need you in my life and here's the reason why!

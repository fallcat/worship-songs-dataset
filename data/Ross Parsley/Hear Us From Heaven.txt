Lord, hear our cry 
 Come heal our land 
 Breath life into these dry 
 And thirsty souls 
 Lord, hear our prayer 
 Forgive our sins 
 And as we call on Your name 
 Would make this a place for 
 Your glory to dwell 
 Open the blinds eyes 
 Unlock the deaf ears 
 Come to Your people 
 As we draw near 
 Hear us from heaven 
 And touch our generation 
 We are Your people 
 Crying out in desperation

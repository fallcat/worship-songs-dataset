I tried perfecting myself 
 Would You love me more without my mistakes? 
 I tried not to ask for Your help 
 'Cause I didn't want to scare You away 
 Yeah, I was always worried 
 I was gonna let You down 
 Oh, it felt like I was standing 
 In between the lost and found 
 Till I got to know You, You 
 I was out of place 
 When You found a way to break through 
 It's true 
 I was just a skeptic, 
 Till I got to know You, You 
 And it's hard accepting Your grace 
 In a world where nothing's free 
 For so long I was afraid 
 That You'd only see the worst in me 
 Yeah, I was always worried 
 You were gonna figure out 
 That I wasn't what You wanted 
 Wasn't worth being around 
 Till I got to know You, You 
 I was out of place 
 When You found a way to break through 
 It's true 
 I was just a skeptic, 
 Till I got to know You, You 
 And you have always been on my side 
 I finally see it 
 It took so long to believe in it 
 'Cause I was always worried 
 I was gonna let you down 
 Till I got to know You, You, ooh 
 Till I got to know You, You, You 
 Till I got to know You, You 
 I was out of place 
 When You found a way to break through 
 It's true 
 I was just a skeptic, 
 Till I got to know You

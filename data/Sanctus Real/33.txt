Oh, I was just a young one 
 When I heard my mother pray 
 I'd never fall away 
 And where we came from 
 We didn't have much 
 But she knew the secret to having everything 
 And she prayed, take this child of mine 
 Keep him in Your hands 
 And now I'm 33 
 Looking at this path behind me 
 And all You've brought me through 
 And I've made my mistakes 
 I've caused my share of heartache 
 But I have seen a mother's prayer come true 
 Oh, Lord my heart still belongs to You 
 Now I look on those young lives 
 Stare in those precious eyes 
 And I understand why my mother prayed for us 
 She never gave up 
 And I know her prayers for me 
 They taught me to believe 
 So I pray, take this child of mine 
 And let me live to hear them say 
 I'm 33 
 Looking at this path behind me 
 And all You've brought me through 
 And I've made my mistakes 
 I've caused my share of heartache 
 But I have seen a father's prayer come true 
 Oh, Lord my heart still belongs to You 
 Oh, I'm 33 and God I see how much I need you now 
 And there's a prayer that carries me through every day of doubt 
 Lord, I want to be the kind of man who passes down 
 A legacy of faith and love that's never burning out 
 Oh, I'm 33 and I still feel those prayers around me 
 And all they've brought me through

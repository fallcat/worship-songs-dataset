After today I'll get me out of this place 
 Into the world so I can set a new pace 
 Seems I'm on my own from here 
 Vision doesn't seem so clear 
 Won't You lay me in Your hands of grace 
 I've got a funny feeling that I'm gonna go away 
 Gonna face my future, gonna try to make the grade 
 I've got a ways to go from here and vision doesn't seem so clear 
 But praise God He's got a plan and understanding isn't my place 
 After today I'm gonna come face to face 
 With a new world who knows I'm feeling this way 
 I've got a ways to go from here 
 I'm gonna overcome these fears 
 Still I'm gonna need Your hands of grace 
 I'll be a bigger man... I'll pray a bigger prayer... I'll dream a bigger dream... for today.

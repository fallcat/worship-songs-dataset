So early morning when you come to me 
 Comfort me 
 Stop rewind and... 
 Play back that melody 
 No early warning when You come to me 
 Comfort me 
 I don't know 'cause I've been told 
 I just believe 
 You don't want to work 'cause it never works out 
 You don't want to talk 'cause words get out 
 (Words get out) 
 Word get around 
 All I want is to 
 Bring you back to love 
 I've got (you've got) we've gotta give it to 
 The one who made me 
 All I want is to 
 Bring you back to love 
 I've got (you've got) we've gotta give it to 
 The one who made me 
 So swiftly coming back to memory 
 Done for me 
 I've got something that you won't believe 
 But You don't want to come 
 'Cause You'll never come around 
 You don't want to love 
 'Cause You never learned (Never learned) how 
 All I want is to 
 Bring you back to love 
 I've got (you've got) we've gotta give it to 
 The one who made me 
 All I want is to 
 Bring you back to love 
 I've got (you've got) we've gotta give it to 
 The one who made me 
 All I have is all I need 
 All you need is what you see 
 All I want is to 
 Bring you back to love 
 I've got (you've got) we've gotta give it to 
 The one who made me 
 All I want is to 
 Bring you back to love 
 I've got (you've got) we've gotta give it to 
 The one who made me 
 All I want is to 
 Bring you back to love 
 To the one who made me... 
 All I want is to... 
 The one who made me...

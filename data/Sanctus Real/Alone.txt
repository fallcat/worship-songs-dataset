True love exists, yes, I know this 
 My heart was waiting for you 
 And when we met I felt my chest 
 Pound fast, racing for the chance 
 To know you, To hold you 
 To open up and show you 
 The way it feels when you know... 
 You are not alone 
 Know that I would fight the tides to 
 Be together 
 When you feel alone 
 Listen to this song to make your heart 
 Feel better 
 Two hearts entwined, yes, you are mine 
 And I'll be yours forever 
 I've done the math, I'm less than half 
 We're better off together 
 And I want you here by my side 
 As much as you are on my mind 
 When I'm gone you should know 
 Rainy Monday feel like Fridays 
 When you're smiling at me I can feel 
 The space 
 Between us collapsing 
 Our love is everlasting 
 Listen to this song 
 Let it make your heart feel better

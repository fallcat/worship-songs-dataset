Lord, You see every part of me 
 I'm tired of feeling underground 
 Time to take this inside 
 And all my insecurity 
 It always gets the best of me now 
 Time to turn this thing around 
 It's time to turn this thing around 
 You and I will be all right 
 If there's nothing more to come 
 'Cause Lord I know I sing tonight 
 For an audience of one 
 There's something new inside of me 
 I'm overwhelmed by what I found 
 Time to take this inside 
 And all my insecurity 
 I won't let it get the best of me now 
 Time to turn this thing around 
 It's time to turn this thing around 
 You and I will be all right 
 If there's nothing more to come 
 'Cause Lord I know I sing tonight 
 For an audience of one 
 Far from these ordinary ways 
 I'll stay 
 So far from these ordinary ways 
 I'll stay 
 Yesterday is gone 
 You and I will be all right 
 If there's nothing more to come 
 'Cause, Lord, I know I sing tonight 
 For an audience of one 
 You and I will be all right 
 Lord, I know I sing tonight 
 For an audience, an audience of one

Time will tell if we really have what it takes 
 This live can crush us underneath its weight 
 When the river rushes over your feet 
 When the bulls are running through your streets 
 You don't have to run from the fears behind you 
 Turn around and I'll stand beside you 
 Take my hand and remember 
 We may bend but will not break 
 Together we may bend 
 But will not break 
 Oh, on the front line you're gonna feel the bullets, gonna feel the heat 
 And when the battles that you fight call you to turn the other cheek 
 When the fire at your back burns bright 
 And when the mountains up ahead are so high 
 You don't have to run from the fears behind you 
 Turn around and I'll stand beside you 
 Take my hand and remember 
 We may bend but will not break 
 Steel your heart and lift your head 
 'Cause we have love and faithfulness 
 So take my hand and remember 
 We may bend but will not break 
 Together we may bend 
 But will not break 
 And if ever you should feel like giving up 
 Remember that God is with us 
 And if ever you should fear you may lose 
 Remember that you don't have to run

Rain falls outside 
 I think the sky must know what's happening tonight 
 Children born while fathers die 
 It's that circle of life that we all live in time 
 We've been friends for a long, long time 
 So if you can't talk, just cry 
 And know that we will talk on the other side 
 It's bitter cold outside 
 But the sun still shines, 'cause we can feel it 
 Benjamin, you mark the life that's been left behind 
 We see him in your eyes 
 And we will be friends for a long, long time 
 So until you can talk, just cry 
 And know that we will talk for the rest of our lives 
 And he gives, and he takes, and it makes us strong 
 And we will be friends for a long, long time 
 So until you can talk, just cry 
 And know that we will talk for the rest of our lives

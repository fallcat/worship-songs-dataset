It starts in your heart and it 
 Changes the rhythm of your life 
 It starts with a spark and it 
 Turns to a fire burning bright 
 Out of the darkness, you feel the joy inside 
 Hey, nothing feels better than this 
 When the sun comes shining in 
 It's a new day, you're wide awake 
 And you feel alive again 
 Hey yea, hey yea 
 It burns deep inside, 
 Changes your world one day at a time 
 It glows in your soul and it 
 Reaches the places you thought you could hide 
 Joy makes you shout into the silence, 
 Makes you wanna face in (?) the hardest times 
 Hey, nothing feels better than this 
 When the sun comes shining in 
 It's a new day, you're wide awake 
 And you feel alive again 
 Nothing feels better than this 
 The chance to start again 
 It's a new day and you just can't wait 
 'Cause nothing feels better 
 Nothing feels better than this 
 There's gonna be days when you wanna give in 
 But you can't give in, you can't give up 
 There's gonna be days when you just can't win 
 And you need something to get you up 
 It's more than enough, when you got love inside 
 Hey yea, hey yea, hey yea 
 Hey, nothing feels better than this 
 When the sun comes shining in 
 It's a new day, you're wide awake 
 And you feel alive again 
 Oh, nothing feels better than this 
 The chance to start again 
 It's a new day and you just can't wait 
 'Cause nothing feels better 
 Nothing feels better than this 
 Hey yea

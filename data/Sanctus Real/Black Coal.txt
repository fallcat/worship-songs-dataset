Do you believe in the restoration of a broken life 
 Hiding behind a face yeah you never know what you might find 
 There in the darkness beneath the surface of time and space 
 Could be a treasure that you'd only see through the eyes of grace 
 Looking for a diamond in the black coal 
 It feels good when you strike gold 
 Diamond in the black coal 
 If you never look then you're never gonna know 
 Well it's so sad when something so radiate is kept from the light 
 'Cause I've seen divine transformation that Jesus provides 
 And like a jeweler with a lifeless gemstone 
 He can make you shine 
 You could be a diamond in the black coal 
 It feels good when you strike gold 
 Diamond in the black coal 
 You gotta look or you're never gonna know 
 Precious diamonds 
 Brilliant shining 
 It's not always what you see 
 A good heart is just like a 
 Diamond in the black coal 
 It feels good when you strike gold 
 Diamond in the black coal 
 You gotta look or you're never gonna know

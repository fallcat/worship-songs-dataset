Where did you go? 
 How have you been? 
 We'll be right here. 
 Where did you go how have you been? 
 Are you still my best friend? 
 Where did you go? 
 How have you been? 
 We'll be right here. 
 Where did you go how have you been? 
 Are you still my best friend? 
 And we've seen best of times, 
 And we've heard worst of lies, 
 But here we stand... Still we stand 
 And we've heard worst of lies, 
 And we've seen best of times, 
 But here we stand... Still we stand 
 Where did you go? 
 How have you been? 
 We'll be right here. 
 Where did you go and have you been 
 I'm tired of remember whens 
 And we've seen best of times, 
 And we've heard worst of lies, 
 But here we stand... Still we stand 
 And we've heard worst of lies, 
 And we've seen best of times, 
 But here we stand... Still we stand 
 And you will take the driver's seat, and I will take the captain's chair, 
 And you will take the driver's seat, and I will take the captain's chair. 
 And you will take the driver's seat, and I will take the captain's chair, 
 And you will take the driver's seat, and I will take the captain's chair. 
 And we've seen best of times, 
 And we've heard worst of lies, 
 But here we stand... Still we stand 
 And we've heard worst of lies, 
 And we've seen best of times, 
 But here we stand... Still we stand

Did I change your mind with 
 What I said last night? 
 Did I break your heart by 
 Straying so far? 
 From what you have in mind 
 For my life? 
 Would you change me from 
 Who I've been lately? 
 'Cause I know I'm nothing 
 Without you 
 Did my words betray the 
 Patience I once claimed 
 Can't you see it in my face? 
 I need your grace 
 Would you change me from 
 Who I've been laterly? 
 'Cause I lnow I'm nothing 
 Without you 
 Would you save me from 
 The way I've been lately? 
 'Cause I can't see living 
 Without you 
 Would you change me from 
 Who I've been lately? 
 'Cause I lnow I'm nothing 
 Without you 
 Would you break me from 
 The way I've been lately? 
 'Cause I can't see living 
 Without you

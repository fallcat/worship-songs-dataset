I'm not satisfied in this lifetime 
 I'm following you to the other side 
 There's nothing that can change my mind 
 You're all I need 
 You're the only tie that binds my heart 
 Away from you I'm falling apart 
 We need to be closer than we are 
 You're all I need 
 So what can I do to get closer? 
 I know there is more my heart can bear 
 I give you control 'cause I need you 
 To take me there 
 Like a bird flying south I'm seeking you out 
 And there's no rope that can tie me down 
 I'm running home, I'm a slave set free 
 So what can I do to get closer? 
 I know there is more my heart can bear 
 I give you control 'cause I need you 
 To take me there 
 I am waiting 
 Draw me closer 
 I am waiting 
 Make me Stronger 
 I am waiting 
 Draw me closer 
 So what can I do to get closer? 
 I know there is more my heart can bear 
 I give you control 'cause I need you 
 To take me there 
 So what can I do to get closer? 
 I know there is more my heart can bear 
 I give you control 'cause I need you 
 To take me there 
 I am waiting 
 Draw me closer

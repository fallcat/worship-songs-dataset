It's no mystery what the difference is 
 Between love that lasts and one that's caving in 
 It takes more than a feeling if you wanna survive 
 In a world that blurs the lines between wrong right 
 Trades true love for a compromise 
 I wanna finish the life we started 
 I wanna be two old beautiful souls that stayed with it 
 And in those times our feelings fade I'm gonna give you the one thing 
 That makes all the difference 
 Commitment 
 Some people say, you shouldn't have to change 
 Somebody should love me exactly the way I am 
 Maybe it's true, but I'll do whatever it takes 
 To help you realize that I'm in for life 
 To lift you up and lay down my pride 
 Oh yeah 
 'Cause I wanna finish the life we started 
 I wanna be two old beautiful souls that stayed with it 
 And in those times our feelings fade I'm gonna give you the one thing 
 That makes all the difference 
 You have my commitment 
 I'm with you, through any kind of weather 
 I'm with you, sunny days or disaster 
 I still do, and it's never gonna matter 
 What we're going through, 'cause we're in this together 
 And I wanna finish the way we started 
 Just two broken souls clinging on to Jesus 
 We've seen His faithfulness and grace and I wanna love you that way 
 I wanna finish the life we started 
 I wanna be two old beautiful souls that stayed with it 
 And in those times our feelings fade I'm gonna give you the one thing 
 That makes all the difference 
 Commitment 
 You have my commitment

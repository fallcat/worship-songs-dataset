I'm craving 
 For the best of You 
 I want the best of You 
 I'm craving 
 To know the depths of You 
 I want to know Your truth 
 That all my thoughts may turn to You 
 May my kingdoms fall to You 
 Build my walls up with Your truth 
 No foundations made from sand 
 Only on Your rock I'll stand 
 With all my strength 
 With all I am 
 I'm craving 
 Wanting You to show 
 A You I've never known 
 I'm craving 
 Wanting You to be 
 The greatest part of me 
 That all my plans may turn to You 
 May my kingdoms fall to You 
 Build my walls up with Your truth 
 No foundations made from sand 
 Only on Your rock I'll stand 
 With all my strength 
 With all I am 
 All I'll be 
 All I am 
 It's in Your hands 
 It's in Your hands 
 All I pray 
 All I have 
 It's in Your hands 
 It's in Your hands 
 May my kingdoms fall to You 
 Build my walls up with Your truth 
 No foundations made from sand 
 Only on Your rock I'll stand 
 May my kingdoms fall to You 
 Build my walls up with Your truth 
 No foundations made from sand 
 Only on Your rock I'll stand 
 With all my strength 
 With all I am

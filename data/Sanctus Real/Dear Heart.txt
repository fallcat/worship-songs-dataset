Dear Heart, do you belong to me, or do I belong to you? 
 Just look at all the trouble you drag me into. 
 I've heard it said to follow your heart, 
 But I'm starting to wonder if it's gone too far. 
 Oh Heart, you've let me down, 
 Chasing love where it can't be found. 
 Heart, we've fallen out, 
 Cause all of your emotions 
 Have led me to doubt. Tell me who's gonna save us now? 
 Dear Heart, you're in the wrong place, 
 Looking out for yourself no matter what I say. 
 And I know that you're holding me back, 
 And it's time for a change, so I'm giving you away. 
 Heart, you've let me down, 
 Chasing love where it can't be found. 
 And Heart, we've fallen out, 
 Cause all of your emotions 
 Have led me to doubt. Tell me who's gonna save us now? 
 La la la la la la la la la, 
 La la la la la la la la la (2x) 
 Heart, you've let me down, 
 Chasing love where it can't be found. 
 And Heart, we've fallen out, 
 Cause all of your emotions 
 Have led me to doubt. Only Jesus can save us now

Yeah, mister deeds has got you wrapped around his finger 
 With what you think you need to do to be delivered 
 You look for accidents so you can be the hero 
 You wrote the charity check that ends in double zeros 
 You help old ladies cross the street 
 You welcome homeless where you sleep 
 You give to everyone in need, 
 You even hold a city key 
 Aren't you great? 
 But that's not good enough 
 If you don't have faith you have nothing at all 
 If you don't have deeds your faith will fall 
 They can't be true without each other 
 You can't have one without the other 
 You think your faith is where you sit on Sunday morning 
 You've got a front row seat where you can be seen snoring 
 Throughout the week you live your life inside a bubble 
 You find your happiness avoiding peoples' troubles 
 Your life revolves around yourself 
 You don't treat others very well 
 You say your faith will get you by 
 And that you won't be left behind 
 You might be right 
 But that's not good enough 
 If you don't have deeds you have nothing at all 
 If you don't have faith your faith will fall 
 They can't be true without each other 
 You can't have one without the other 
 If you don't have faith you have nothing at all 
 If you don't have deeds your faith will fall 
 They can't be true without each other 
 You can't have one without the other 
 You know I can't see thinking that I'd be 
 Better off living just for selfish ambition, no 
 I know that faith is more than just believing 
 We should do the right things for the right reasons 
 If you don't have faith you have nothing at all 
 If you don't have deeds your faith will fall 
 They can't be true without each other 
 You can't have one without the other 
 If you don't have deeds you have nothing at all 
 If you don't have faith your faith will fall 
 They can't be true without each other 
 You can't have one without the other

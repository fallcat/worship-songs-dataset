I heard you say you would love for a lifetime 
 Now you complain a lifetime just doesn't feel right for you 
 Another casualty of casual love 
 Another soul out of place, a heart that gave up 
 Why do we break the promises we make? 
 Are we living for ourselves? 
 Don't give up on love and throw it all away 
 Don't give up on love and let it fall away 
 When did it become so easy to run from your pain 
 Don't give up on love and throw it all away 
 I heard you say you can't change a stubborn heart 
 I can relate 'cause that's how I feel when I talk with you 
 Why should it take losing everything 
 To realize it might be time to change? 
 Your restless heart won't win 'cause you take but you don't give 
 And you'll keep moving on until you learn what love is 
 Don't give up on love and throw it all away 
 Don't give up on love and let it fall away 
 Don't give up on love

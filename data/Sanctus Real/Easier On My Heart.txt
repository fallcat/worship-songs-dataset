If I could run the distance 
 Between Your heart and mine 
 If I could climb my way up 
 To the highest point 
 I could see everything that You want me to see 
 I could breathe the air that You breathe 
 I want to breathe the air that You breathe 
 It would be a little easier on my heart 
 If I had a taste of Heaven 
 It would be a little easier to hang on 
 If it wasn't so hard to imagine 
 Take, take, take me in Your arms 
 Take, take, take me in Your arms 
 Take me in Your arms 
 Make it a little easier on my heart 
 I've wandered lonely spaces 
 In search of who You are 
 I hold the times I'm with You 
 So closely to my heart 
 How else could I know the power of love 
 If it never lifted me up 
 If it never lifted me up 
 C'mon take, take, take me in Your arms 
 Don't let me get away 
 Hold me close to Your heart 
 Take, take, take, me in Your arms 
 Don't let me fall away 
 When I'm falling apart

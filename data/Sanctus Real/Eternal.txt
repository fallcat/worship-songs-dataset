I know this life I lead will pass away 
 Along with every other earthly thing 
 So I will set my heart on a higher plain 
 Where my treasure lies with You 
 And in this marriage of our hearts 
 There is no death do us part 
 For You are eternal 
 And I am eternally Yours 
 And I could never lose Your love to sickness 
 Oh I could never lose You to divorce 
 And there's no concept of abandonment 
 For I am safe within Your arms 
 And in this marriage of our hearts 
 There is no death do us part 
 For You are eternal 
 And I am eternally Yours 
 Oh I am eternally Yours 
 I am eternally Yours 
 (No abandonment) 
 (Safe within Your arms) 
 I never had enough until I found You 
 I never knew love until I met You 
 I never had enough until I found You 
 And now I have everything 
 And in this marriage of our hearts 
 There is no death do us part 
 For You are eternal 
 And I am eternally Yours 
 And I am eternally Yours 
 Oh I am eternally Yours 
 I could never lose You 
 No I will never lose You 
 I could never lose You 
 And this life will pass away 
 But You will never change 
 Oh this life will pass away 
 Oh but You will never change

Be my light in this Darkend room 
 I'm on my face and I'm calling to you 
 I Can't fathom all you've done all you've done for me 
 Everytime it finds me on my knees 
 Like sun light in the winter cold 
 Everything about you it takes my breath 
 Away... Halleujah 
 I tride this once without you and it was 
 My great mistake... Halleujah 
 Questions fade when you invade 
 You chase all my fears away 
 With your love in my atmosphere 
 All confusion disappears 
 And nothing your truth remains 
 Questions fade, you remain 
 You are like color on a page of white, bright 
 Like eyes beneath black lights 
 Like a glowing city on the plains, you call 
 My name 
 Halleujah

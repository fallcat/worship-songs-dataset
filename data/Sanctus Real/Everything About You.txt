Be my light in this darkened room 
 I'm on my face and I'm calling you 
 I can't Fathom all you've done for me 
 Every time it finds me on my knees 
 Like sunlight in the winter cold 
 Everything about you, it takes my breath away... Hallelujah 
 I tried this once without you and it was my great mistake... Hallelujah 
 Questions fade when you invade 
 You chase all my fears away 
 With your love in my atmosphere 
 And all confusion disappears 
 And nothing but your truth remains 
 Everything about you, it takes my breath away... Hallelujah 
 I tried this once without you and it was my great mistake... Hallelujah 
 Questions Fade, you remain 
 You are color on a page of white, bright 
 Like eyes beneath black lights 
 Like a glowing city on the plains, you call my name 
 You call my name 
 Everything about you, it takes my breath away... Hallelujah 
 I tried this once without you and it was my great mistake... Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah

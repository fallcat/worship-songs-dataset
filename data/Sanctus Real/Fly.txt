When last place is where I've been 
 It's hard to find the strength to start again 
 Sometimes it seems like I can never win 
 I'm held back by the weight of the crowd 
 Can't move to find my way out 
 You give me faith to get my feet off the ground 
 'Cause it's not easy... 
 Trying to fly against the wind 
 When I keep on falling back to where I've been 
 Start over again 
 I'm overwhelmed when there's too much 
 Hiding the view to all that you've done 
 I step back to see how far we've come 
 And you're always with me, when I'm... 
 Trying to fly against the wind 
 But I keep on falling back to where I've been 
 Start over again 
 When last place is where I've been 
 You give me what I need to start again... again... again... 
 Trying to fly against the wind 
 But I keep on falling back to where I've been 
 Trying to fly against the wind 
 And you keep on coming back for me again 
 Over and over again

Well, the past is playing with my head 
 And failure knocks me down again 
 I'm reminded of the wrong that I have said and done 
 And that devil just won't let me forget 
 In this life, I know what I've been 
 But here in Your arms, I know what I am 
 I'm forgiven 
 I'm forgiven 
 And I don't have to carry the weight of who I've been 
 'Cause I'm forgiven 
 My mistakes are running through my mind 
 And I relive my days in the middle of the night 
 And I struggle with pain, wrestle with my pride 
 Sometimes I feel alone, and I cry 
 And in this life, I know what I've been 
 But here in Your arms, I know what I am 
 I'm forgiven 
 I'm forgiven 
 And I don't have to carry the weight of who I've been 
 'Cause I'm forgiven 
 When I don't fit in 
 And I don't feel like I belong anywhere 
 When I don't measure up to much in this life 
 Oh, I'm a treasure in the arms of Christ 
 'Cause I'm forgiven 
 I'm forgiven 
 And I don't have to carry the weight of who I've been 
 'Cause I'm forgiven

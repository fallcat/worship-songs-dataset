(Feat. Katie Herzig) 
 Oh I want every second of the minutes in the hours of these days 
 Cause there's too many trees to climb 
 And secret spots to find down by the lake 
 Oh the fireflies are out and momma's calling now 
 We can't go to sleep 'cause we'll wake up older 
 We can't let these nights steal away half our lives 
 And we will spend our days finding helpless competition to defeat 
 Yeah we'll chase away the girls and pretend 
 That we don't want 'em on our street 
 Yeah the sun is running too 
 Being chased off by the moon 
 And we should go to bed but we'll catch fireflies instead 
 We can't go to sleep 'cause we'll wake up older 
 We can't let these nights steal away 
 And I don't want these days to ever be over 
 We can't let these nights just steal away 
 Oh just stay awake with me 
 Won't you stay awake with me 
 Oh stay awake with me 
 We can't go to sleep 'cause we'll wake up older 
 We can't let these nights steal away 
 And I don't want these days to ever be over 
 We can't let these nights steal away half our lives

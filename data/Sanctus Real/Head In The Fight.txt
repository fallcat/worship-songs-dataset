I don't want to waste my life 
 I don't want to waste my time 
 You only have a little bit 
 And before you know it's gone in the blink of an eye 
 I don't want to break my stride 
 I don't want to fall behind 
 And I don't care who's doing what they do 
 I'm gonna do what's right 
 You gotta keep your head in the fight 
 You can't give up in the hardest times 
 Can't let your spirit die 
 If you're gonna survive 
 You've gotta keep love in your heart 
 A prayer on your tongue 
 And just when you think that you've fought enough 
 Keep your head in the fight 
 If you wanna come out alive 
 Fight for the Kingdom come 
 Fight for the ones you love 
 And when you feel weak 
 Fight on your knees 
 'Cause that's where your strength comes from 
 You gotta keep your head in the fight 
 You can't give up in the hardest times 
 Can't let your spirit die 
 If you're gonna survive 
 You've gotta keep love in your heart 
 A prayer on your tongue 
 And even if you think that you've already won 
 Keep your head in the fight 
 'Cause you're gonna come out alive 
 Tell me, who's gonna stay in the fight 
 Who's gonna stand for what's right 
 Who's gonna carry the light, carry the light 
 I'm gonna stay in the fight 
 I'm gonna stand for what's right 
 I'm gonna carry the light, carry the light 
 On the other side

You might think, you'll never be the one to save the day 
 Or do anything that matters in the world 
 But god can take your ordinary life and do great things 
 When you step out in faith 
 You don't need to be the biggest in life 
 Don't need to be the strongest to fight for what's right 
 Cause a hero's great for who they are inside 
 Don't need to be the tallest in line 
 You could be the smallest in size 
 And if your heart's right, you could be our hero tonight 
 So will you take, the little that you have, and make a change 
 For the weak and helpless in the world 
 If your embrace the journey that's before you, leadthe way 
 Your faith will guide you 
 And in your weakness, you will find your strength 
 Don't need to be the biggest in life 
 Don't need to be the strongest to fight for what's right 
 Cause a hero's great for who they are inside 
 Don't need to be the tallest in line 
 You could be the smallest in size 
 If your heart is right, you could be our hero 
 And if you feel afraid, when the road ahead looks hard 
 Follow your heart 
 You could be the flame, for a world that fears the dark 
 Brighter than the stars 
 Don't need to be the biggest 
 Don't need to be the strongest 
 To do what's right 
 Cause hero's are great for who they are inside 
 Don't need to be the tallest in line 
 You could be the smallest in size 
 And if your heart is right, you could be our hero.

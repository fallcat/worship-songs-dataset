So confined by the fear that you hold on to. 
 And time unwinds and nothing seems promised you. 
 So hey wait, I want to take you for a ride. 
 Hey wait, I want to catch you while there's time. 
 Who'll pick you u when there's no one around? 
 Who'll hold you up when your heart hits the ground? 
 So defined by a love that has fallen through, 
 But hope is kind when you hope in something you know is true. 
 So hey wait, I want to take you for a ride. 
 Hey wait, I want to catch you while there's time. 
 I'll pick you u when there's no one around 
 I'll hold you up when your heart hits the ground 
 You're tired and you can't take another time around. 
 You know it's hope I'm holding, so I hope I've found you in this. 
 I found you in this 
 I'll pick you u when there's no one around 
 I'll hold you up when your heart hits the ground 
 I'll pick you u when there's no one around 
 I'll hold you up when your heart hits the ground

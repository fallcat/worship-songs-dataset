Can I look past the cliche' in every moment? 
 Can I learn to be amazed by you? 
 Can I find a simple way to praise you 
 Even if it's already used? 
 Can I put my pride aside and learn to sing in 
 Time with someone elses praises? 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you nothin' new 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you nothin' new 
 Can I accept that in a world of 
 Changes you're not impressed with something new? 
 If I don't understand the language of a heart 
 That's after you can I put my pride aside and learn 
 To sing in time with someone elses phrases? 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you nothin' new 
 I love you 
 I love you 
 I love you nothin' new

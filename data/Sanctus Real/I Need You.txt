I believe and I'm willing to stand 
 Make a confession that I won't take back 
 Let me say it so that everyone hears 
 If they're against me I don't care 
 A hater's gonna hate their life away 
 A lover's gonna hear the truth and be changed 
 I don't wanna let my pride in the way 
 'Cause I'm just a sinner who needs to be saved 
 I need You 
 This is serious 
 I need You more than an experience 
 I need You 'cause You're the real thing 
 I need You I used to be so curious 
 What it would take to feel completed 
 Now I know You're all I needed 
 I need You 
 Break it down everybody's the same 
 Adam and Eve all over again 
 Looking for the reason that we were made 
 When all the signs are waving right in front of our face 
 I'm not gonna let the moment slip away 
 I'm not gonna leave it all to fate 
 I'm not gonna make the same mistakes 
 Over and over and over again 
 In a world with too many voices 
 Too many choices 
 You're what the point is

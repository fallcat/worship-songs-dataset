Well nobody wants to get lost in the crowd 
 Buried beneath the ambient sounds 
 Under the beat of a million hearts 
 Finding you can be the hardest part 
 Well I found my way to trouble 
 I found my way to pain 
 Well but I'm so tired of trying 
 To find my own way 
 So I wanna get lost 
 I wanna get lost in your arms 
 I wanna get lost 
 And lose my way into your heart 
 'Cause there's so many voices 
 Telling me how to get lost in this life 
 So right now I wanna get lost in you 
 Before I lose myself 
 I never imagined at the start 
 The thousand ways I could find my heart 
 Caught in a web of compromise 
 Stuck in the prison of my own lies 
 It was easy to find my way 
 Not as easy to get out 
 Oh the roads to my own ruin 
 Are too easily found 
 So I wanna get lost 
 I wanna get lost in your arms 
 I wanna get lost 
 And lose my way into your heart 
 'Cause there's so many voices 
 Telling me how to get lost in this life 
 But right now I wanna get lost in you 
 Before I lose myself 
 And I'm tired of trying to find my own way 
 And I'm tired of playing the mouse in the maze 
 Like I'm memorizing the same old phrase 
 Just repeating my steps to the same old place 
 Oh, I wanna get lost tonight 
 I wanna get lost 
 I wanna get lost in your arms 
 I wanna get lost 
 And lose my way into your heart 
 'Cause there's so many voices 
 Telling me how to get lost in this life 
 So right now I wanna get lost in you 
 Lost in you 
 Before I lose myself 
 Before I lose myself

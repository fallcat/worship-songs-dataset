I heard the sound of your first breath 
 A brand new life on your mother's chest 
 A beating heart, expectant eyes 
 On the first day of your life 
 I saw you take your first step 
 And I watched you run with no regret 
 To chase your dreams and find true love 
 And the best is yet to come 
 So come with Me 
 I'll show you life 
 Even better than this 
 Come with Me 
 I'll show you love 
 You didn't know could exist 
 Better than your first crush 
 Better than your first kiss 
 I'll show you how to live 
 Remember how you felt from across the room 
 When you realized someone had eyes for you 
 And the way your heart sang 'cause you believed 
 You were worth something 
 So come with me 
 I'll show you life 
 Even better than this 
 Come with me 
 I'll show you love 
 You didn't know could exist 
 Better than your first crush 
 Better than your first kiss 
 I'll show you how to live 
 Oh, I'll show you how to live 
 'Cause I created your heart 
 That makes you feel 
 I am the love that makes it real 
 Oh, I am the One, I'm the One, I'm the One 
 I am the One, I'm the One, I'm the One 
 So come with Me 
 I'll show you life 
 Even better than this 
 Come with Me 
 I'll show you love 
 You didn't know could exist 
 Better than your first crush 
 Better than your first kiss 
 I'll show you how to live 
 'Cause I am the One, I'm the One, I'm the One 
 I am the one, I'm the One, I'm the One

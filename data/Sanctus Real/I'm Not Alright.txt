If weakness is a wound 
 That no one wants to speak of 
 Then "cool" is just how far we have to fall 
 I am not immune 
 I only want to be loved 
 But I feel safe behind the firewall 
 Can I lose my need to impress? 
 If you want the truth, I need to confess 
 I'm not alright 
 I'm broken inside 
 Broken inside 
 And all I go through 
 It leads me to you 
 It leads me to you 
 Burn away the pride 
 Bring me to my weakness 
 Until everything I hide behind is gone 
 And when I'm open wide 
 With nothing left to cling to 
 Only you are there to lead me on 
 'Cause honestly, I'm not that strong 
 I'm not alright 
 I'm broken inside 
 Broken inside 
 And all I go through 
 It leads me to you 
 It leads me to you 
 And I move closer to you 
 I'm not alright 
 I'm broken inside 
 Broken inside 
 And all I go through 
 It leads me to you 
 It leads me to you 
 I'm not alright... that's why I need you

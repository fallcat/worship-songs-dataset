Lord, You see every part of me- I'm tired of feeling underground. time to take this inside out. and all my insecurity- it always gets the best of me. time to turn this thing around. 
 Lord, I fear I'm drowning here for an audience of one. and all I know is what I've been told- that there's something yet to come. 
 There's something new inside of me- I'm tired of feeling all worn out. time to take this inside out. and all my insecurity- I won't let it get the best of me now. time to turn this thing around. 
 Far from these ordinary ways, I'll stay... yesterday is gone.

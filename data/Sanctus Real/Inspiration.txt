Restless heart 
 Wait a little while longer 
 Heaven is holding out for you still 
 Lay your hand on somebody's shoulder 
 While you're here show someone you care... 
 Show them you're there 
 Inspiration is you and i 
 Changing nations 
 Changing lives 
 We all feel just a little bit older 
 As names and faces are passing us by 
 But there is a reason 
 Our hearts won't grow colder 
 There is one thing that won't ever change... 
 It's always the same 
 Seems we'll never do enough 
 To tell the world about God's love 
 But every soul is worth the fight 
 'Cause we can change the world 
 By changing just one life

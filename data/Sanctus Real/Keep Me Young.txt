Feels like I've seen everything out there 
 But next to You nothing compares 
 We're all looking for love, 
 To catch that breath of new life 
 And You're the fountain everyone's after 
 The promise of love and forever 
 Time slips away, but You're holding me 
 So it's alright 
 There's nothing more sure than this romance 
 Nothing better than my heart in Your hands 
 Who can keep me from a love that lasts? 
 No one can 
 You keep me young, You keep me young 
 You keep me young, under an old sun 
 Days go by fast as lightning 
 Life is short but I can't fight it 
 So I lean in to You, and Your hope burns through 
 This old life 
 There's nothing more sure than this romance 
 Nothing better than my heart in Your hands 
 Who can keep me from a love that lasts? 
 No one can 
 You keep me young, You keep me young 
 You keep me young, under an old sun 
 You keep me young, You keep me young 
 You keep me young, yeah You're the only one 
 When I'm with you 
 There's nothing better cause You're all that matters 
 When I'm with you 
 There's nothing better cause You're all that matters 
 There's nothing more sure than this romance 
 Nothing better than my heart in Your hands 
 Who can keep me from a love that lasts? 
 No one can 
 You keep me young, You keep me young 
 You keep me young, under an old sun 
 You keep me young, You keep me young 
 You keep me young, yeah You're the only one

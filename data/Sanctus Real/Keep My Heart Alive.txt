I'm so tired of politics and all this bad news 
 I'm so tired of chasing the moment instead of chasing You 
 I let the World wear me down, I'm desensitized 
 Jesus keep my heart alive, keep my heart alive 
 Only You can save me from a world that's breaking right before my eyes 
 Keep my heart alive 
 Take these empty "hallelujahs", and fill my lungs again 
 'Cause I want to sing, and I want to mean it 
 I want to feel again 
 And let the world hear the sound of something divine 
 Jesus keep my heart alive (Only You can save me), 
 Keep my heart alive (Only You can save me) 
 Only You can save me when my world is breaking right before my eyes 
 Jesus keep my heart alive (Only You can save me), 
 Keep my heart alive (Only You can save me) 
 Only You can save me when my hope is fading, and I'm losing the fight 
 And when the world wears me down, 
 You're my lifeline 
 You keep my heart alive (Only You can save me), 
 Jesus keep my heart alive (Only You can save me), 
 Keep my heart alive (Only You can save me) 
 Only You can save me when my world is breaking right before my eyes 
 Keep my heart alive (Only You can save me) 
 Oh, keep my heart alive (Only You can save me) 
 You're my only hope, when my world is fading before my eyes 
 Jesus keep my heart alive 
 Keep my heart alive

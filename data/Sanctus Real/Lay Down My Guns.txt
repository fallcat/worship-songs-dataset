Well I just need a place to lay my head 
 Forget the chain that hangs around my neck 
 These guns are not as heavy as the hearts they defend 
 I can't wait to get back home where I can find some rest 
 When I lay down my guns and lift my hands 
 Surrender to Love and live again 
 May this desert reach its end where my new life begins 
 When I lay down my guns and lift my hands 
 And I have seen the devil in this place 
 And I lost myself when my friends found the grave 
 When you're this far from Heaven 
 It's hard to keep the faith 
 I'm barely holding on 
 I can't wait to 
 Lay down my guns and lift my hands 
 Surrender to Love and live again 
 May this desert reach its end where my new life begins 
 When I lay down my guns and lift my hands 
 And I'm laying down these burdens 
 Taking off the weights 
 And I can't count the miles that I've walked to find my way 
 To lay down these guns 
 How I need to lay down these guns 
 Lay down my guns and lift my hands 
 Surrender to Love and live again 
 May this desert reach its end where my new life begins 
 And I'll abandon my defenses and live to love again 
 When I lay down my guns and lift my hands 
 Lay down 
 Lay down 
 Lay down my guns

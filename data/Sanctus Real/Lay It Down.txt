I know you have your problems 
 'Cause everybody's got 'em 
 If you get lost in your sorrows 
 Then you could hit rock bottom 
 But if you smile in face of trivial things 
 And you learn to pray when you wanna complain 
 Stand up straight when the Earth is shaking 
 And just breathing when you feel afraid 
 Oh, don't you know 
 Those problems you're worried about 
 They can't keep you from living now 
 When you shake 'em off and lay 'em down, down, down 
 At the cross where your freedom's found 
 Oh You can stand up no matter what 
 March on when times are tough 
 Be strong and don't give up 
 All you need now 
 Is to shake 'em off and lay 'em down 
 At the cross where your freedom's found 
 We all have our seasons 
 When we get caught up in our feelings 
 And I know there's a time for laughter and a time for pain 
 A time for doubt and a time for faith 
 But when you believe you can find the strength 
 So get back up on your feet 
 Lay it down, lay it down 
 Why you holding on so tight 
 Oh, the freedom you will find 
 When you let go God will take over the fight 
 Oh, just surrender 
 And feel what it's like to be free again

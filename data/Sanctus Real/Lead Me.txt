I look around and see my wonderful life 
 Almost perfect from the outside 
 In picture frames, I see my beautiful wife 
 Always smiling, but on the inside, oh, I can hear her saying 
 Lead me with strong hands 
 Stand up when I can't 
 Don't leave me hungry for love, chasing dreams 
 But what about us 
 Show me you're willing to fight 
 That I'm still the love of your life 
 I know we call this our home 
 But I still feel alone 
 I see their faces, look in their innocent eyes 
 They're just children from the outside 
 I'm working hard, I tell myself, "They'll be fine; they're independent" 
 But on the inside, oh, I can hear them saying... 
 Lead me with strong hands 
 Stand up when I can't 
 Don't leave me hungry for love, chasing dreams 
 But what about us 
 Show me you're willing to fight 
 That I'm still the love of your life 
 I know we call this our home 
 But I still feel alone 
 So Father, give me the strength to be everything I'm called to be 
 Oh, Father, show me the way to lead them 
 Won't You lead me? 
 To lead them with strong hands 
 To stand up when they can't 
 Don't want to leave them hungry for love 
 Chasing things that I could give up 
 I'll show them I'm willing to fight 
 And give them the best of my life 
 So we can call this a home 
 Lead me, 'cause I can't do this alone 
 Father, lead me, 'cause I can't do this alone

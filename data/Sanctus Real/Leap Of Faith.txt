This too shall pass oh but it always comes back 
 And it's knocking upon your door 
 You say how did you find me here 
 'Cause I've been running for years 
 Now you're back in the same place 
 You've been here before 
 Stuck in a maze trying to find an open door 
 Pray for the strength and take a leap of faith 
 You fail in your mind long before you ever try 
 Why do you believe those lies 
 You love to drown your fears 
 But you've been drowning for years in tears 
 Back in the same place 
 You've been here before 
 Stuck in a maze trying to find an open door 
 Pray for the strength and take a leap of faith 
 So what are you waiting for 
 Cause there is a Saviour waiting to save you 
 What are you drowning for 
 Back in the same place 
 You've been here before 
 Stuck in a maze trying to find an open door 
 Pray for the strength and take a leap of faith

What will they say when I'm gone, 
 In words that are written in stone? 
 Under my name, what will they claim about me? 
 Oh, I want to leave a legacy to be remembered. 
 More than just a memory that fades away 
 Because we only, we only get one life 
 Free me, my hands are tied 
 I'm so tired of wasting time 
 These endless inventions 
 Steal my attention from real life 
 And when its done, when it's over 
 Oh, I want to leave a legacy to be remembered 
 More than just a memory that fades away 
 Because we only, we only get one life 
 And will the world see Christ 
 When they look at my life? 
 Oh, will the world see? 
 Mmm, come on, give me, give me, give me real life 
 And no more, no more, no more wasting time 
 Because we only, we only get one life (Just one Life) 
 Oh, I want to leave a legacy to be remembered 
 More than just a memory that fades away 
 Because we only, (Get one shot, at this one life) We only (One moment in time) 
 Because we only, we only get one life

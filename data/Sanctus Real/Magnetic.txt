How do we explain the source of life 
 That runs within these veins and keeps my heart in time? 
 You are the music and I'm drawn in 
 Caught in the movement, I'm letting go, I can't resist 
 ('Cause) 
 You're magnetic 
 I can't help it I'm stuck on you 
 There's something magic in the way that you love me 
 I'm stuck on you 
 I know I have the freedom to decide 
 You don't make me love you 
 I just can't deny the force of gravity 
 And you are the ground that keeps me standing here with you 
 You're magnetic I can't help it 
 I'm letting go of all control 
 Can't deny it, I won't fight it 
 No matter what I do I'm drawn to you

So there's no room for God's own words on city walls 
 That's ten more reasons to be praying for us all 
 We'd better fight because it might not be too long 
 Before they say they've made our faith against the law 
 And I've got a message I'm taking to the masses 
 And I don't care if anyone tries standing in my way because... 
 You can't hold us down 
 We're running fast and we're not stopping now 
 Going for the gold, we're going home 
 Yeah, when we die we'll return the prize 
 To the one who kept us running 
 Was right there by our sides 
 What a way to go home! 
 To everyone who's stood alone for doing right 
 You are the heroes of these dark, and desperate times 
 We can't go solo if we're gonna win this fight 
 We're only stronger when we're standing side by side 
 So, we've got a message we're taking to the masses 
 We don't care if anyone tries standing in our way because...

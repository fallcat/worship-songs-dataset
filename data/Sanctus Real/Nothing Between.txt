I'm miles away from seeing the story You're writing 
 When You give and You take, it's hard to embrace (?) 
 When I'm watching the walls burn to the ground around me 
 Just wanna know what it is, You're trying to show me 
 I will walk through the fires of life 
 I will wait in the darkest of nights 
 I will follow You into the fight 
 If that's where You'll lead me 
 I don't know what You want me to see 
 But I know where You want me to be 
 Close to You, nothing between 
 I'm starting to see why this is called the narrow road 
 'Cause if I wanna walk this way, oh I've gotta stay close 
 I'll leave anything in the fire to bring us together 
 I want nothing between my soul and my Savior 
 I will walk through the fires of life 
 I will wait in the darkest of nights 
 I will follow You into the fight 
 If that's where You'll lead me 
 I don't know what You want me to see 
 But I know where You want me to be 
 Close to You, nothing between 
 If it comes (?) and You're around me 
 Let it burn cause You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 I will walk through the fires of life 
 I will wait in the darkest of nights 
 I will follow You into the fight 
 If that's where You'll lead me 
 I don't know what You want me to see 
 But I know where You want me to be 
 Close to You, nothing between 
 I want nothing between my soul and my Savior 
 Nothing between

Give love one to another 
 Give love one to each other 
 And we'll be fine 
 We'll be fine 
 I feel alone, I feel so cold, 
 When I'm far from you for just one night 
 You keep me alive 
 Feeling fine 
 When I've got something as good as you inside. 
 Got nothing to lose been breaking in twos 
 But I need something to get me through this 
 There's no better time 
 Than when I find, You in a feeling 
 And know I'm doing all right 
 Nothing to hide, just to confide 
 When I've got something as good as You inside 
 What the world needs now 
 Is a little know how 
 To turn itself upside down

Remember when you couldn't wait 
 To show up early and find your place. 
 'Cause you didn't want to miss a thing. 
 And your heart was open and ready for change. 
 Oh, those days. 
 You were never afraid to sing, 
 Never afraid to lift your hands. 
 Didn't care what people would think. 
 You were on fire, 
 And church was more than a place, 
 And people were more than faces, 
 And Jesus was more than a name. 
 Remember when you weren't ashamed. 
 To tell your friends about your faith. 
 A time when you felt the pain 
 Of just one lost soul that was slipping away. 
 Your heart was soft, you had radiant eyes, 
 But slowly the pressures and burdens of life 
 Pulled you into the dark of the night. 
 But when did you lose your sight? 
 'Cause you were on fire, 
 And church was more than a place, 
 And people were more than faces, 
 And Jesus was more than a name. 
 Oh you were on fire, 
 You let life put out the flame. 
 But he's still calling out for you 
 'Cause he wants to light your heart again. 
 And set it on fire 
 Set it on fire. 
 Turn your eyes, turn your eyes 
 And don't forget what it was like 
 Set me on fire, set me on fire 
 I wanna hold God's people close 
 Wanna feel the power of Jesus' name 
 Set me on fire 
 Set me on fire

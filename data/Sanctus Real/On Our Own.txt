Just to know who You are 
 To find a way into Your arms 
 From the wreckage, we are reaching 
 Out of silence, we are singing 
 We cannot make it on our own-oh-oh-oh 
 We need You everywhere we go-oh-oh-oh 
 To be seen through Your eyes 
 To have You here on our side 
 By Your presence, You have healed us 
 To Your promise, You will lead us 
 We cannot make it on our own-oh-oh-oh 
 We need You everywhere we go-oh-oh-oh 
 You are the hope of so much more 
 Jesus, without You we cannot make it on our own-oh-oh-oh 
 We gotta keep our eyes on true hope 
 Set our hearts on a heavenly home 
 We gotta keep our eyes on true hope 
 Set our hearts on a heavenly home 
 We gotta keep our eyes on true hope 
 Set our hearts on a heavenly home 
 We gotta keep our eyes on true hope, true hope, true hope 
 We cannot make it on our own-oh-oh-oh 
 We need You everywhere we go-oh-oh-oh 
 You are the hope of so much more 
 Jesus, without You we cannot make it on our own-oh-oh-oh 
 We gotta keep our eyes on true hope 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
 Set our hearts on a heavenly home 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
 We gotta keep our eyes on true hope 
 Set our hearts on a heavenly home 
 We gotta keep our eyes on true hope, true hope, true hope

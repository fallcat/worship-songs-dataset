I'm gonna tell you why we keep on coming back 
 To the same old set of tired and rusty tracks 
 Dreams fade and wither all the time 
 But you know when you're born for something in this life 
 And I'm gonna tell you why we keep on keeping on 
 'Cause a song was made for us and us for a song 
 It knocks on the door of your heart and you can't deny 
 But you open up, you let it inside 
 So I sing at the top of my lungs 
 Raise my hands and get caught up 
 It's just one of those things you can't run away from 
 (One of those things you can't run away from) 
 One of those things you can't run away from 
 (One of those things you can't run away from) 
 And I'm gonna tell you why we keep on singing about 
 Love and faith and the things that so many people doubt 
 Oh there's a fire in us, that burns from the inside out 
 We don't need to water it down 
 So I sing at the top of my lungs 
 Raise my hands and get caught up 
 It's just one of those things you can't run away from 
 (One of those things you can't run away from) 
 One of those things you can't run away from 
 So I sing at the top of my lungs 
 Raise my hands and get caught up 
 Well I sing at the top of my lungs 
 Raise my hands and get caught up 
 It's one of those things you can't run away from 
 (One of those things you can't run away from) 
 It's one of those things you can't run away from 
 (One of those things you can't run away from) 
 One of those things you can't run away from 
 (One of those things you can't run away from) 
 Yeah, one of those things you can't run away from 
 Can't run away from, can't get away from

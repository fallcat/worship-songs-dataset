You have so many big ideas 
 But you don't know what to do 
 To take something inside of you 
 From make believe to a dream come true 
 We all wanna be spiritual giants 
 We all wanna do greater things 
 It all starts with a grateful heart 
 And the will to live you what it says 
 One word, live it out 
 Show us what it's all about 
 Living one word 
 One word at a time 
 Living one word 
 Living one word 
 One word at a time 
 Living one word 
 Every morning is a new sunrise 
 A chance to change the world by living out your life 
 One word at a time 
 It's the way that we were created 
 God spoke and it came to be 
 And I don't doubt, but I believe 
 That He's alive in the words we read 
 One word 
 Live it out 
 C'mon and show the world what it's all about 
 Living one word 
 Can lead you to freedom 
 Can make you courageous 
 Living one word 
 Can help you discover 
 Your life direction

Feeling I've been robbed of something more than meets the eye. laughter fades and joy is faint when new songs have run dry. oh, but I have found a love that covers all things. 
 You are the song that I long to sing when all is said and done. You've inspired the kind of life that moves my soul. I want to sing something beautiful- the song You've placed in me. just one taste of You has caused this overflow. 
 Borrowed by some foreign savior, shadowing what's right. now she's back and her redemption seems so out of sight. oh, but I have found a grace that covers all things. 
 Will I ever find a melody that makes You sing? will I ever write a song as beautiful as Thee? will I ever reach a place where only You are seen in me?

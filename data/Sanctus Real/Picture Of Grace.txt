Took us thirty something years to see the light 
 It took a whole lot of tears and sleepless nights 
 It took the pain of wondering why, wondering why, 
 Oh why 
 But now I see every tear we've cried 
 Is a drop of purpose in the sea of life 
 And as the water washes over you and I 
 I can see something holy made of two broken lives 
 'Cause we believe in something bigger than our own lives 
 We'll keep reaching for someone who's stronger than you and I 
 And I look back and marvel at the day 
 When I thought our world would be a perfect place 
 But now we see through a shattered frame 
 There's nothing more perfect than the picture of Grace 
 We can finally see the picture of Grace 
 'Cause we believe in something bigger than our own lives 
 We'll keep reaching for someone who's stronger than you and I 
 We need a Savior, one who can heal what is broken tonight 
 Just one touch, just one word could set everything right 
 We need a miracle, we need a miracle 
 Take what is weak and fill it with life 
 We need a miracle, we need a miracle 
 Take this water and turn it to wine 
 (x2) 
 'Cause we believe in something bigger than our own lives 
 We'll keep reaching for someone who's stronger than you and I 
 We need a Savior, one who can heal what is broken tonight 
 Just one touch, just one word could set everything right

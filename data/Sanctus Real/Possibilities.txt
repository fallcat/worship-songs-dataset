Remember the day when we ran away 
 And we saw the world for the first time? 
 We drove through the night to those big city lights 
 And we knew that we could do anything 
 Anything at all 
 We don't have to live memories 
 Time can turn our dreams to reality 
 Oh, the possibilities 
 Now is the time to make up our minds 
 And live like this is the last day 
 That we have a chance to put it on the line 
 And run away to the best time of our lives 
 Because I still believe that we can we do anything 
 Walk through the doorway to the great unknown 
 This is the moment

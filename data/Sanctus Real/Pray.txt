I bow my head to pray, I don't know what to say 
 I'm not sure how to fix the things I'm dealing with 
 I'm in a desperate place, I need to share the weight 
 But I just don't know how, to let it all pour out 
 Though I'm silent, my heart is crying 
 'Cause I was made to come to You 
 So I pray 
 God I need You more than words can say 
 Right here in this moment 
 You know my heart, You know my need 
 You know every part of me 
 So even if it's just to speak Your name 
 I'm gonna pray 
 I failed to find the time, but You've been calling out 
 I let the days go by as if I could live without 
 But it's gotta be here now, I won't be pulled away 
 'Cause it's just You and I, so let the world around us fade 
 As I pray 
 God I need You more than words can say 
 Right here in this moment 
 You know my heart, You know my need 
 You know every part of me 
 So even if it's just to speak Your name 
 I'm gonna pray 
 I'm gonna pray 
 (Father) 
 Will You meet me here right now? 
 (Father) 
 I surrender, lay it down 
 (Father) 
 And every time I close my eyes 
 I know that I was made 
 To lift my hands and pray 
 I lift my hands and pray 
 You know my heart, You know my need 
 And every single part of me 
 So even if it's just to speak Your name 
 I'm gonna pray 
 I'm gonna pray 
 You know my heart, You know my need 
 You know every part of me 
 I bring willing words and one heart (?) 
 Take it as an offering

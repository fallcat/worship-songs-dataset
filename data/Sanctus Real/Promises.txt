Sometimes it's hard to keep believing 
 In what you can't see 
 That everything happens for a reason 
 Even the worst life brings 
 If you're reaching for an answer 
 And you don't know what to pray 
 Just open up the pages 
 Let His word be your strength 
 And hold on to the promises (Hold tight) 
 Hold on to the promises (Alright) 
 Jesus is alive so hold tight 
 Hold on to the promises 
 All things work for the good 
 Of those who love God 
 He holds back nothing that will heal you 
 Not even His own Son 
 His love is everlasting 
 His faithfulness unending 
 Oh, if God is for us who can be against us 
 So if you feel weak 
 Neither life, nor death 
 Could separate us 
 From the eternal love 
 Of our God who saves us

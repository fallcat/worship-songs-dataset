All here below 
 Waiting patiently 
 Surrounded by a symphony 
 Of lots of love 
 Understood 
 By all to be the one 
 When as, I fall 
 In your Arms 
 Deep Inside, 
 Purify 
 Breathe new life to me 
 Be my remedy 
 Wrap me tight, 
 In Your arms 
 Speak your peace to me 
 Be my remedy 
 2nd Verse 
 Life as we know 
 Not what memory 
 Looked down the page 
 Of this story 
 By all He's done 
 Understood by all to be the one 
 When as, I fall 
 Into Your arms 
 When as, I fall 
 Into Your arms 
 Forever 
 Forever 
 And ever 
 Ever

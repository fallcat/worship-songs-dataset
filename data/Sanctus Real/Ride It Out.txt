Sometimes you feel like you're losing yourself in this life 
 You're a ship with your sails set high and there's wind in the air tonight 
 You pray someone saves you 
 Before the storm takes you 
 When you feel afraid 
 Don't you turn around in the sea of doubt 
 You don't want to drown if the ship goes down 
 So clear your eyes 
 Keep your sails high 
 And ride it out 
 The waves they will shake you 
 They may strike fear in your heart 
 Oh, this trial will shape you 
 Help you find life in the dark 
 When you stand on the edge of an ocean 
 Don't let it swallow your faith 
 Don't you turn around in the sea of doubt 
 You don't want to drown if the ship goes down 
 So clear your eyes 
 Keep your sails high 
 And ride it out through the sea of doubt 
 Don't let your fear steal your finest hour 
 Embrace the ride 
 Keep your sails high 
 And ride it out 
 The wind will take you where you're meant to be 
 The waves will break when your Creator speaks 
 And when it's over you will clearly see 
 That the storm was only there to show you what it takes to believe

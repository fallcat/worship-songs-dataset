Wake up, oh my soul 
 You've been sleeping far too long 
 So wake up, oh my soul 
 Stand up and be known 
 You've been hiding far too long 
 Just stand up and be known 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms of love 
 There's only one way to find your help 
 One place to lose yourself 
 One way to find your help 
 So reach out for your hope 
 Let these arms hold you close 
 Reach out for your hope 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms of love 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms of love 
 Don't lose heart when you're feeling low 
 When the road looks long and you don't know 
 If you have the strength to make it home 
 You're not on your own 
 Don't lose heart when you're feeling low 
 When the road looks long and you don't know 
 If you have the strength to make it home 
 You're not on your own 
 You're not on your own 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms of love 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms 
 You gotta run, run, run into the arms of love

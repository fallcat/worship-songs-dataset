There's no other reason 
 No other rhyme 
 Nothing but this for which we fight 
 All for the One who gives us life 
 No other purpose 
 No other pledge 
 Nobody else has conquered death 
 Under this banner we are united by the same love 
 Same life, giving us a reason 
 Same love, giving us freedom 
 Same God, that we believe in 
 Same way, leading us to heaven 
 Same hope, holding us together 
 Same God, always forever 
 Every thread 
 Weaving through time 
 Slowly revealing the great design 
 Until we see the Kingdom forever united by the same love 
 They will know we are one 
 By our love 
 By our love

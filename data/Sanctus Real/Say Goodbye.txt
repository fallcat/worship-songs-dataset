So say goodbye 'cause you'll be leaving soon 
 I know it's hard, and I'll be missing you 
 I know its time to say goodbye 
 I know the road, has worn you down 
 You never broke, you always held your ground 
 But now its time to say goodbye 
 And I know we'll meet again, but I wish It'd never end 
 You don't mean to make me cry 
 But it's so hard to say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 And though you're gone I remember now 
 The time we shared, you're words still ring out 
 You're never far, you're in my heart 
 And I know we'll meet again, but I wish It'd never end 
 You don't mean to make me cry 
 But it's so hard to say goodbye 
 Oh, Oh 
 Say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 And I know we'll meet again, but I wish It'd never end 
 You don't mean to make me cry 
 But it's so hard to say goodbye 
 Someday we'll meet again 'cause that's how the story ends 
 It's so hard to say goodbye 
 Say goodbye

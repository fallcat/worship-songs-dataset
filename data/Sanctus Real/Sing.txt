Can we get back to where we started 
 When creation lived peacefully in Your hands 
 Before the wars began 
 And all these years we have been divided 
 Jesus' voice has been gently calling us home 
 And we can't wait anymore 
 Lord we feel You now 
 Wanting to come down and teach us how to 
 Sing oh sing 
 With one voice how sweet it will be 
 When we sing oh sing 
 One church under one King and we will sing 
 Pride has no purpose in God's kingdom 
 Now's the time for His church to join hands again 
 Oh together we must stand 
 Lord we need You now 
 Send Your Spirit down and free us as we 
 Sing oh sing 
 With one voice how sweet it will be 
 When we sing oh sing 
 One church under one King and we will sing 
 Hear the voices ringing out (You are King) 
 We will stand together now (You are Lord) 
 Hear the voices singing loud (You are King) 
 Live in peace 
 Live in peace and 
 Sing oh sing 
 With one voice how sweet it will be 
 And we will sing oh sing 
 One church under one King and we will sing 
 Hear the voices ringing out (You are King) 
 We will stand together now (You are Lord) 
 Hear the voices singing loud (You are King) 
 Live in peace 
 Let the church of God ring out (You are King) 
 We will stand together now (You are Lord) 
 Hear the voices singing loud (You are King) 
 There is only one King

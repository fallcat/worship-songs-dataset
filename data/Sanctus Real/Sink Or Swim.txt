It is not safe to assume that I am like me in any way. 
 I do not even like the taste of broken words or my broken promises 
 I will not even waste my time here. 
 I know what I've been called to be 
 I know it won't include me 
 You're trouble, You're wasted 
 You know I just won't take this 
 Sink or swim 
 There is no place for you in what I am called to do 
 Heart under grace, I do not understand the way 
 You curse, you bend my words, you just praise Jesus to be heard 
 When will we ever learn? 
 I know what I've been called to do 
 I know it won't include you 
 You're trouble, You're wasted 
 You know I just won't take this 
 Sink or swim

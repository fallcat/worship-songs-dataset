Must be tiring to meet my resistance 
 My stubborn will can be so twisted 
 Pride can steal the best from me 
 But it's not what I want 
 But You're what I need 
 So I surrender 
 I want You 
 To take over me 
 I want You 
 To take over me 
 I don't wanna be part of the resistance 
 I wanna be part of the release 
 So I want You to take over me 
 Oh, I can't survive a state of existence 
 Struggling to find what's missin' 
 I wanna win the war between these skin and bones 
 And what's underneath 
 So I surrender 
 Yeah, I surrender 
 I want You 
 To take over me 
 I want You 
 To take over me 
 I don't wanna be part of the resistance 
 I wanna be part of the release 
 So I want You to take over me, yeah 
 Never want to, never wanna be against You 
 Never meant to, never meant to resist You 
 I never want to, never want to be against You, against You 
 Oh, how could I resist You?! 
 So I want You 
 To take over me 
 I want You 
 To take over me 
 I don't wanna be part of the resistance 
 I wanna be part of the release 
 So I want You to take over me, yeah

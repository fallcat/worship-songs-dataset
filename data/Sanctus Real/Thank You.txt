There are new horizons with colors that I've never seen 
 The sky is filled with graces, since you have carried me 
 I felt so far beyond your reach, but you gave everything for me 
 I was lost but you rescued my life 
 Why in the world did you come after me? 
 Thank you 
 Words aren't enough, but for now I can say 
 Thank you 
 There is hope rising 'cause you have strength I've never seen 
 And your eyes are shining, 'cause you shed tears for me 
 I was miles from dry land, but you gave everything you had 
 I can't understand a love of this kind 
 I could find other lines that you haven't heard spoken over and over again 
 I've tried every way, but I keep landing on that simple phrase 
 So I'll keep singing, thank you

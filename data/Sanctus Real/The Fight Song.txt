I'm sorry for what I said about you 
 Will you accept my apology? 
 I am sorry 
 Hey, now what am I to do? 
 I'd better think twice before I make my move 
 'Cause last time I didn't think it through 
 Don't know where it's going to go 
 Don't know what we're going to do 
 And hey, now what am I to say? 
 My foolish words got in the way of us being friends 
 Wake up, make up, can we get along again? 
 I don't really want to fight over something that's really nothing 
 It doesn't matter 
 I don't really want to scar your heart with words that hurt you 
 I won't hurt you 
 Did you feel all right 
 When you hung me out to dry? 
 Everybody knew 
 When you put it on the six o'clock story on the nightly news 
 Now it's time to think 
 Through this mess of words we made 
 Tongues are hard to tame 
 Powerful as politics, sharper than a razor blade 
 Did you really want to fight over something that's really nothing? 
 It doesn't matter 
 Did you really want to scar my heart with words that hurt me? 
 Don't hurt me 
 I don't really want to cry over issues 
 Wet tissues stick to my shoes 
 We can't take back words we've spoken 
 But I'm hoping you'll forgive me 
 I don't care about what you said about me 
 Can we agree to disagree? 
 I am sorry 
 Did you really want to fight over something that's really nothing? 
 It doesn't matter 
 Did you really want to scar my heart with words that hurt me? 
 Don't hurt me 
 I don't really want to cry over issues 
 Wet tissues stick to my shoes 
 We can't take back words we've spoken 
 But I'm hoping you'll forgive me 
 I'm hoping you'll forgive me 
 I'm hoping you'll forgive me

Sometimes I just want to start over, 'cause everything looks like a wreck 
 And I need the courage to carry on, 'cause I can't see what's ahead 
 And there are places I've wished I could be, battles I've wanted to win 
 Dreams that have slipped through my hands 
 I may never get back again 
 But I'm still a dreamer, a believer 
 Oh, I've lost my faith in so many things, but I still believe in You 
 'Cause You can make anything new 
 Sometimes I just wish we could say all the things that are easy to hear 
 Ignore the injustice we see and explain every unanswered prayer 
 But I'd rather speak honestly and wear a tattered heart on my sleeve 
 'Cause in the middle of my broken dreams, redemption is here 
 And I'm still a dreamer, a believer 
 Oh, I've lost my faith in so many things, but I still believe in You 
 'Cause You are the answer, the redeemer 
 Oh, I've given up on too many things, but I'm not giving up on You 
 'Cause You can make anything new 
 I don't have every answer in life 
 But I'm trusting You one day at a time 
 'Cause You can make a weak heart stay alive forever 
 This is where Heaven and Earth collide 
 I lift my hands and give my life 
 This is how my weary heart stays alive 
 Oh, I'm still a dreamer (This is where heaven and earth collide) 
 (I lift my hands and give my life) 
 Still a believer (This is how my weary heart stays alive) 
 Oh, You are the answer (Oh, this is where Heaven and Earth collide) 
 (I lift my voice and give my life) 
 The redeemer (This is how my weary heart stays alive, oh) 
 'Cause You can make anything new 
 Yeah, You can make anything new

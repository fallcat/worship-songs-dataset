Oh, I'd do anything to feel the wind that day 
 There in the upper room, all in one place 
 And I'd give anything to hear the sound of the spirt coming down 
 And the Praises they sang 
 It's the way that your beauty takes the stage 
 Bigger than a star struck grand parade 
 Louder than the sound of rock 'n' roll 
 Lights down, take a bow, you know you stole the show 
 And though I've never seen those holy tongues of fire 
 I feel you in my heart, you inspire me 
 I see you moving in the simple things 
 In the way you give me life, It's the reason I sing 
 It's the way that your beauty takes the stage 
 Bigger than a star struck grand parade 
 Louder than the sound of rock 'n' roll 
 Lights down, take a bow, you know you stole the show 
 You stole the show 
 You stole the show 
 You stole the show 
 It's the way that your beauty takes the stage 
 Bigger than a star struck grand parade 
 Louder than the sound of rock 'n' roll 
 Lights down, take a bow, you know you stole the show 
 It's the way that your beauty takes the stage (You stole the show) 
 Bigger than a star struck grand parade (You stole the show) 
 Louder than the sound of rock 'n' roll 
 Lights down, take a bow, you know you stole the show 
 You stole the show 
 You stole the show 
 You stole the show 
 You stole the show 
 Lights down, take a bow, you know you stole the show

Get a hold of yourself 
 Try and figure it out... figure it out 
 There's a way to escape 
 But the choices you make 
 Stand in the way 
 So they say that it's the only way 
 But now you know how I feel about it 
 And I can't escape 
 The way you feel 
 'Cause it's the way I feel 
 And it's surreal 
 Take a look at yourself 
 Are you wondering how 
 It's gonna work out? 
 And there's a way to escape 
 What you think is your fate 
 But you say it's too late 
 And I can't escape the way you feel 
 'Cause it's the way I feel 
 And it's surreal 
 And I cannot change 
 The way it is 
 'Cause it's the life that you live 
 And it's so real 
 I'm missing you still 
 I have felt so far from home here 
 Don't want to stir the waters 
 Of a restless soul 
 I'll learn to let this go 
 There's a way to escape 
 What you think is your fate 
 It's never too late

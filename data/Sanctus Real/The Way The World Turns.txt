Empty moments when I feel hopeless 
 Have left me restless inside 
 Doubt and sadness have kept me in fragments 
 Longing for a better life 
 Oh, it's the way the world turns 
 The way, the way 
 And I feel the current pulling me down 
 Can't keep the world from turning around 
 So I keep turning to You 
 I keep turning 
 'Cause You're the hope of a new sunrise 
 Breaking over a desperate life 
 And I keep turning to You 
 I keep turning to You 
 I'm so distracted by senseless passions 
 Tempting my wandering eyes 
 But ever pursuit brings me closer to the truth 
 That only You can satisfy 
 When I feel the current pulling me down 
 Can't keep the world from turning around 
 So I keep turning to You 
 I keep turning 
 'Cause You're the hope of a new sunrise 
 Breaking over a desperate life 
 And I keep on turning to You 
 I keep turning 
 The way we're hurting keeps us turning to You 
 To You 
 Oh it's the way the world turns 
 The way the world turns 
 Oh, and I keep on turning to You 
 Oh it's the way the world turns 
 The way the world turns 
 Oh, and I keep on turning to You 
 'Cause You're the hope of a new sunrise 
 Breaking over a desperate life 
 And I keep on turning to You 
 Oh it's the way the world turns 
 The way the world turns 
 Oh, and I keep on turning to You 
 I keep turning to You 
 I keep turning to You

Maybe I've had too much on my plate, 'cause lately there's been too much in the way of living life the way that You intended it to be, and giving of myself as freely as I have received. but know that I want to be... 
 Living the way You wanted, giving the way I got it. 
 Maybe I have never felt the pain of living life that goes against the grain. yeah, living it the way that You created it to be and giving of myself as freely as You gave to me.

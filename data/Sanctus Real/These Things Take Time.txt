I want to know why pain makes me stronger 
 I want to know why good men die 
 Why am I so afraid of the dark, but I stray from the light? 
 I want to know why You gave me eyes when faith is how I see 
 And tell me, is it easier to doubt or harder to believe? 
 Oh, there's so many questions stirring in me 
 And I'm wondering why 
 Sometimes the truth ain't easy to find 
 I want to know all the answers 
 But I'm learning that these things take time 
 Yeah, these things take time 
 How can success make us feel like failures? 
 And the harder we fall, the harder we try 
 The more I have the more I need just to feel like I'm getting by 
 Oh, there's so many questions in one short life 
 And I'm wondering why 
 Sometimes the truth ain't easy to find 
 I want to know all the answers 
 But I'm learning that these things take time 
 Yeah, these things take time 
 And we spend so much time chasing our tails 
 Hoping to find every last answer to everything in life 
 So many questions, not enough time 
 But I'm still wondering why 
 Sometimes the truth ain't easy to find 
 I want to know all the answers 
 But I'm learning that these things take time 
 Yeah, these things take time 
 Hey, we all want to understand why evil lives, and good men die 
 On the way to Heaven, the truth unwinds 
 These things take time 
 These things take time 
 Yeah, these things take time

Loving things like you has wrecked my life 
 Made me cry 
 Loving things like you has made me lose my mind 
 And I can't figure out why I've been hanging on 
 To all these things I've tried to leave behind me for so long 
 And I think it's time to find 
 A better way to live my life 
 Than loving all those things that keep me wrapped so tight 
 'Cause everyone wants everyone else's everything 
 Sometimes the more we have, the less we really gain 
 And I'm tired of loving all that money has to buy 
 Get out of my heart, out of my mind, leaving you behind 
 Get out of my heart, out of my mind, leaving you behind 
 Loving things like you has left me bruised 
 Black and blue 
 Loving things like you has made me so confused 
 And I can't figure out what I've been waiting on 
 God, I can't be living life for things I know are wrong 
 Now I think it's time to write a better chapter in my life 
 Leaving all those things that keep me wrapped so tight 
 'Cause everyone wants everyone else's everything 
 Sometimes the more we have the less we really gain 
 And I'm tired of loving all that money has to buy 
 Get out my heart, out of my mind, leaving you behind 
 Why are we obsessed with possessions here on Earth? 
 Go and take a look at the flowers and the birds 
 God is always taking care of nature's every need 
 And how much more important in the Father's eyes are we 
 I said how much more important in the Father's eyes are we 
 He sees everything 
 Everyone wants everyone else's everything 
 Sometimes the more we have the less we really gain 
 And I'm tired of loving all that money has to buy 
 Get you out of my heart, out of my mind, leaving you behind 
 Get you out of my heart, out of my mind, leaving you behind 
 Out of my heart, out of my mind, leaving you behind

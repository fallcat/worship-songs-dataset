(Feat. Peter York) 
 We're sending out a message to the future 
 That words could not communicate 
 Don't think it's something that's electric 
 Just 'cause were using the radio waves 
 We're turning on the lights 
 Down through the halls of time 
 Flip on the switch, illuminate the future 
 Send a shock through the power lines 
 Turn it up so everyone hears it 
 Transmit the signal to the world 
 You've got to listen for what you're missing 
 'Cause it's going to change your life 
 I want to see the lights illuminate the night 
 Our endless hearts burning like the stars 
 Lights of the world arise!

I think I caught a glimpse of 
 Life without friends 
 Bitter, empty, hollow, dark and lonely 
 We never meant to hurt each other 
 So Can't we trust again 
 And take it as a chance 
 To keep on growing 
 I don't know why it doesn't come easy 
 But I know that we could be happy 
 If we'd only learn to love 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 So what's the fighting for 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 Please don't close the door 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 Through all the highs and lows 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 'Cause no one's meant to live alone 
 Life revolves around the need 
 Of having someone 
 Causing every complicated feeling 
 Oh and I don't want to lose you 
 And there is nothing wrong with 
 Telling me what you need 
 To keep our love strong 
 It's just a part of being a family 
 Taking the good with the bad and the ugly 
 If we could only learn to love 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 So what's the fighting for 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 Please don't close the door 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 Through all the highs and lows 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 'Cause I don't want to be alone 
 Oh Oh we need each other 
 Fathers and Mothers 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 All your sisters and brothers 
 Oh oh we need each other 
 We need friends and lovers 
 Oh Oh we need each other 
 Well I need you 
 You need me 
 'Cause that's the way 
 It's meant to be 
 I need you 
 We need each other 
 (I don't want to be alone)

We will not lose heart 
 We will not lose hope 
 When all we see is fading 
 We trust in what we know 
 We will never give up 
 Pressed on every side 
 Praying for escape 
 We can see the answer 
 That You're the only way 
 We will never give up 
 We will fix our eyes on the One who will last forever 
 We will hold on tight to the only real treasure 
 We will not lose heart 
 We will not lose hope 
 We will give our lives to the One who will last forever 
 We were born into weakness 
 Fragile by design 
 So we hold onto Jesus 
 With everything inside 
 We will never give up 
 We will fix our eyes on the One who will last forever 
 We will hold on tight to the only real treasure 
 We will not lose heart 
 We will not lose hope 
 We will give our lives to the One who will last forever 
 Greater is the One in us 
 We will never give up 
 Power of the Risen Son 
 We will never give up 
 We will never give up 
 We will fix our eyes on the One who will last forever 
 We will hold on tight to the only real treasure 
 We will not lose heart 
 We will not lose hope 
 We will give our lives to the One who will last forever 
 We will not lose heart 
 We will not lose hope 
 We will give our lives to the One who will last forever 
 Forever

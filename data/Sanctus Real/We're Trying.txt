There's a familiar progression to the similar lives that we all lead 
 We're trying hard to become someone we can't be 
 You won't find grace without honesty 
 Everyone wants reality, so here it is; I believe that nobody is good 
 We are liars and thieves, we're destroying the peace 
 But we're trying 
 It's the same regression to the lives that we all lead 
 Everyone makes mistakes, but we find grace 
 We believe that there's redemption 
 If you want reality, here it is; I believe that nobody is good 
 There is nothing in our blood that makes the heart beat strong enough 
 Apart from grace, apart from love 
 I believe in grace 
 I believe with love that we can do good

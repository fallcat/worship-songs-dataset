It's time for healing time to move on 
 It's time to fix what's been broken too long 
 Time make right what has been wrong 
 It's time to find my way to where I belong 
 There's a wave that's crashing over me 
 All I can do is surrender 
 Whatever you're doing inside of me 
 It feels like chaos somehow there's peace 
 It's hard to surrender to what I can't see 
 But I'm giving in to something heavenly 
 Time for a milestone 
 Time to begin again 
 Revaluate who I really am 
 Am I doing everything to follow your will 
 Or just climbing aimlessly over these hills 
 So show me what it is you want from me 
 I give everything I surrender... 
 To... 
 Time to face up 
 Clean this old house 
 Time to breathe in and let everything out 
 That I've wanted to say for so many years 
 Time to to release all my held back tears 
 Whatever you're doing inside of me 
 It feels like chaos but I believe 
 You're up to something bigger than me 
 Larger than life something heavenly 
 Whatever you're doing inside of me 
 It feels like chaos but now I can see 
 This something bigger than me 
 Larger than life something heavenly 
 Something heavenly 
 It's time to face up 
 Clean this old house 
 Time breathe in and let everything out

Are we afraid of what people say, what they think about us? 
 This is the way of cynical hearts learning to trust 
 Everyone is scared of feeling out of a place 
 Breakaway the walls 
 Carry us to where we belong 
 Make a way for us to follow grace so we can love everyone the same 
 Can I learn to drop my guard and show someone my heart? 
 Break the vice of stereotypes that keep us apart 
 I'm no stranger to the feelings of being insecure and out of place

How many times 
 Did I not stand 
 Up for you? 
 Face to face 
 With someone I 
 Hardly knew? 
 Where did they 
 Go from there? 
 Lost in the world 
 And we may 
 Never meet again 
 God, will you 
 Send another 
 Light to lead 
 Them in? 
 Where will they 
 Go from there? 
 Love, show me 
 The way 
 When I'm afraid 
 To say the 
 Right thing 
 I'm a stone, 
 Frozed in place 
 I need your 
 Grace to show 
 Me how to love 
 How many lives 
 Could be 
 Changed if 
 I'd convey 
 All of the words 
 That I was scared 
 To say 
 Show me the way 
 From here 
 Love, show me 
 The way 
 When I'm afraid 
 To say the 
 Right thing 
 I don't know 
 Where they 
 Will go 
 As long as I 
 Know I have 
 Shown Your love 
 I am lost without 
 Your love

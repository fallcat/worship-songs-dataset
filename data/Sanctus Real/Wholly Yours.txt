I think I caught a glimpse of a life without friends 
 Bitter, empty, hollow, dark and lonely 
 We never meant to hurt each other so can't we trust again 
 And take it as a chance to keep on growing 
 Well, I don't know why it doesn't come easy 
 But I know that we could be happy 
 If we'd only learn to love 
 Oh, oh, we need each other so what's the fighting for 
 Oh, oh, we need each other, please don't close the door 
 Oh, oh, we need each other through all the highs and lows 
 Oh, oh, we need each other 'cause no one's meant to be alone 
 Life revolves around the need of having someone 
 Causing every complicated feeling 
 Oh and I don't want to lose you so there is nothing wrong with 
 Telling me what you need to keep our love strong 
 Oh, it's just a part of being a family 
 Taking the good with the bad and the ugly 
 If we could only learn to love 
 Oh, oh, we need each other so what's the fighting for 
 Oh, oh, we need each other, please don't close the door 
 Oh, oh, we need each other through all the highs and lows 
 Oh, oh, we need each other and I don't wanna be alone 
 Oh, oh we need each other, fathers and mothers 
 Oh, oh we need each other, all your sisters and brothers 
 Oh, oh we need each other, we need friends and lovers 
 Oh, oh we need each other 
 I need you, you need me 
 'Cause that's the way it's meant to be 
 I need you, we need each other 
 I don't want to be alone 
 I need you, you need me 
 'Cause that's the way it's gotta be 
 I need you, we need each other 
 I don't want to be alone

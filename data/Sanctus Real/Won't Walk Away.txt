You never walked away 
 You never left or let me down 
 You always set me free 
 But though You love me I was found 
 So I won't walk away 
 And I will follow 
 You wherever You lead 
 I won't walk away 
 You always lead me on 
 To where You know I need to be 
 Forever I will trust in 
 Where Your wings will carry me

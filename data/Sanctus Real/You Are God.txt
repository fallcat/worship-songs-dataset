Your ways are higher than, anyone could understand 
 Your thoughts run deeper, You are God 
 You save but it's not because, of anything that we have done 
 But only by Your mercy and Your great love 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 Not mine but Your will be done 
 Not mine but Your kingdom come 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 Plans of the heart belong to men, 
 The outcome is in Your hands 
 Without You nothing stands, You are God 
 You hold the beginning and end, You know every where and when 
 Without You nothing would have ever been 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 Not mine but Your will be done 
 Not mine but Your kingdom come 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 (?) 
 When we felt dead in our sins, looking for love 
 We know that You made the way 
 Cause You are God, You are God, You are God 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 You are God, You are God, You are God 
 Not mine but Your will be done 
 Not mine but Your kingdom come 
 You are God, You are God, You are God

When you're feelin' all alone 
 And you've got no friends on the phone 
 When you've reached your all-time low, he'll be around 
 In your car, in the stars, He's everywhere you are 
 He's alive and He'll always find you 
 When your down He's around and He knows 
 Of all the places you can go, you will never be alone 
 Of all the places you could find, there is nowhere you can hide 
 When you think you've escaped he's right beside you 
 When you sleep, when you wake, in the midst of your heartbreaks 
 He is there, and he knows... 
 Of all the places you can go, you will never be alone 
 Of all the places you could find, there is nowhere you can hide 
 Make no mistake, He'll be around 
 Make no mistake, He's all around 
 Make no mistake, He's all around 
 Make no mistake, He's all around... 
 Of all the places you can go, you will never be alone 
 Of all the places you could find, there is nowhere you can hide 
 When you're feelin' all alone 
 And you've got no friends on the phone 
 When you've reached your all time low, he'll be around

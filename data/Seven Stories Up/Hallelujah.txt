God of Heaven- 
 Glorious You reign on high 
 Great redeemer- 
 Lord we come to glorify 
 Here to sing of- 
 All the wonders You have done 
 Lift your voice 
 Sing this louder 
 Hallelujah to the king 
 To the name above all names 
 He alone is the one who is worthy of all praise 
 Lift your voices, lift your hands 
 And in adoration sing 
 To the king returning

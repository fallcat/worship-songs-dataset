Striking the match that burns me 
 Pouring more gasoline onto the flame 
 I'm to blame 
 I'm all alone and bleeding 
 And every self-inflicted wound's in vain 
 Am I addicted to my pain? 
 And I can't look without You here 
 Will You wash away all my fear? 
 Addicted to my pain 
 'Cause I can't see and I can't feel 
 God, I'm praying none of this is real 
 Addicted to my pain 
 I am the judge and jury 
 I always sentence me to be condemned 
 There's no amends 
 I hate with no conditions 
 Will I ever be forgiven for my rage? 
 And break out of this cage 
 And I can't look without You here 
 Will You wash away all my fear? 
 Addicted to my pain 
 'Cause I can't see and I can't feel 
 God, I'm praying none of this is real 
 Addicted to my pain 
 Take this guilt, this bitter rage 
 Keeping me locked in chains 
 Can You heal my heart? 
 Can You take this pain? 
 Will You wash away all these things? 
 And I can't look without You here 
 Will You wash away all my fear? 
 Addicted to my pain 
 'Cause I can't see and I can't feel 
 God, I'm praying none of this is real 
 Addicted to my pain, my pain

She gives herself away again 
 Already knowing just how this will end 
 But she just wants to hear she's beautiful 
 Tears fade like falling stars 
 But the pain of a broken heart remains it won't fade away 
 (Won't fade away) 
 She's begging for mercy cause it hurts too much 
 She's losing her faith but she's not giving up 
 She's praying to Jesus "Would you save my soul?" 
 Begging for mercy 
 All she wants is love 
 All she wants is love 
 She's losing something deep inside 
 The bottle's always been her place to hide 
 She's never felt this lost before 
 1:20 crossing double lines 
 Trying to run from the demons in her mind she wants to feel alive 
 (To feel alive) 
 She's begging for mercy cause it hurts too much 
 She's losing her faith but she's not giving up 
 She's praying to Jesus "Would you save my soul?" 
 Begging for mercy 
 All she wants is love 
 All she wants is love 
 (She wants His love) 
 She's been lost for so long 
 All she wants is to find her way back home 
 She's coming undone 
 There's only one who can save her name 
 She's begging for mercy cause it hurts too much 
 She's losing her faith but she's not giving up 
 She's praying to Jesus "Would you save my soul?" 
 Begging for mercy 
 All she wants is love 
 All she wants is love 
 All she wants is love

I'll never find the words to say 
 How beautiful you are, my son 
 And everyday that this life brings 
 You have to know how much you're loved 
 Even when I'm far away 
 I will dream of you tonight 
 I will pray to God to bless your life 
 Always, always 
 As you grow and start to change 
 I will love you just the same 
 Always, always 
 And when you feel like giving up 
 I will walk you through the pain 
 And when you feel like life's too much 
 Remember Jesus is your strength 
 Always 
 There will come a day when I'll explain 
 All the mistakes your dad has made 
 I hope you see that it was Christ 
 And only Him that rescued me 
 Even when I fell away

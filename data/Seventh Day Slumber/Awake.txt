As time went on I opened up my eyes 
 You never really knew me 
 You don't know what's deep inside 
 Just so you know I'll never be like you 
 I'll take what God has made me 
 I'm not an empty shell 
 And I hope they see instead of following 
 I'm finally awake 
 I feel alive today 
 I feel everything 
 It's all so clear to me 
 How many times have I hated who I was 
 Lost sight of what defines me 
 'Cause of airbrushed magazines 
 But now I've come to cherish who I am 
 I'm sick and tired of faking a life that wasn't mine 
 I'm alive 
 It's all so clear to me 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 It's all so clear to me 
 And I hope they see

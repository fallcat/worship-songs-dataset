Carry me away. Back in time to when I met You 
 Take all this guilt and shame 
 That buried me, and bury me in You 
 I want to be dead but still alive 
 I want to breathe hope instead of choking 
 I want to feel the fire deep inside 
 Burn through me and carry me away 
 How fake could I be? You see through me 
 You see right through me 
 Would You sing to me? 
 And take me back to when I met you 
 I hear You calling me 
 I feel so far from home 
 You can see through my past 
 You've never let me go

Where do I go from here, It feels like I'm falling apart 
 God I know You're real, sometimes I just feel so all alone 
 And I fake just to hide a smile but I just want to cry 
 There's a fear inside of ending up right where I began 
 Don't let me end up where I began 
 I'm calling Your name, oh Lord 
 Tonight I'm desperate and I just wanna sit in Your arms 
 Even if You don't speak, it's cool with me 
 I just wanna be where You are, whoa, whoa 
 And sometimes I still can't see how You can love somebody like me 
 I fail and I fall so hard so far from where I wanna be 
 So I fake just to hide a smile but I just want to cry 
 There's a fear inside of ending up right where I began 
 Don't let me end up where I began 
 I'm calling Your name, oh Lord 
 Tonight I'm desperate, I just wanna sit in Your arms 
 Even if You don't speak, it's cool with me 
 I just wanna be where You are 
 And there's no place that I'd rather be 
 'Cause no other loves like You 
 Like the waves crashing into the sea 
 I just want to fall in Your arms 
 Fall in Your arms, I fall in Your arms 
 I'm calling Your name, oh Lord 
 Tonight I'm desperate, I just wanna sit in Your arms 
 Even if You don't speak, it's cool with me 
 I just wanna be where You are 
 I'm calling Your name, oh Lord 
 Tonight I'm desperate, I just wanna sit in Your arms 
 Even if You don't speak, it's cool with me 
 I just wanna be where You are, be where You are 
 I'm calling Your name, oh Lord 
 I just want to fall in Your arms

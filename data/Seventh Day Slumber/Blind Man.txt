I here the laughter of the blind man 
 Growing colder each and every day 
 I hear the silence of the blind man 
 Shake the walls inside his loney cage 
 I've seen the deception of the blind man 
 Steal his soul and leave his body torn 
 So much confusion in this blind man 
 His only hope is to be reborn 
 Why can't anyone hear me? 
 Have I been left for dead? 
 Is anybody out there? 
 Who can save me from my head? 
 The desperate howling of the blind man 
 Makes him bitter and leaves his mind deranged 
 The pain engreaved inside the blind man 
 Will brack his bones and leave him bound in chains 
 I pray for freedom for the lind man 
 So he won't die inside his solitude 
 Yeah there is freedom for the blind man 
 If he listens he'll be freed with truth

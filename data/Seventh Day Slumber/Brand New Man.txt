A morning rainbow fills the sky, I think I'm dead 
 But I know I'm not dead yet 
 I've been missing You, You've been here all along 
 I guess sometimes I just forget 
 There was comfort in Your breath 
 You made me believe that life was worth it 
 I'm a brand new man. I will never be the same 
 I'm a brand new man. I will never be the same 
 I remember the day that I met You. The emptiness I had 
 Could fill a mountain. And I believed it was true, 
 My pain would never go away 
 But there was comfort in Your breath, 
 You made me believe that life was worth it. 
 And I'm not looking back 
 My past is far behind me, yeah 
 I'm stronger every day 
 You've made me a brand new man

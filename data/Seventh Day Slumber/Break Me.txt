Broken pieces of the man I used to be are all that's left of who I am 
 A shattered mass of all my countless broken dreams. 
 I wonder where I go from here 
 But I'm on my way and I'm not falling. 
 You're all the same 
 You tried to break me 
 I'm on my way and I'm not falling 
 You're all the same 
 You tried to break me down 
 I found the one that I was always searching for 
 No more empty promises 
 I've come to realize what I'm worth is so much more 
 More than how you made me feel 
 First in line, I'm last in line, 
 First to eat, I'm last to eat 
 First in line, I'm last in line 
 First to eat, I'm last to eat 
 First in line, I'm last in line, 
 First to eat, I'm last to eat 
 It doesn't matter much to me 
 It doesn't matter much to me.

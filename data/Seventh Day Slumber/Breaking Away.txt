I've finally realized that all my dreams lost 
 Were lost because of me 
 But tonight, I am changing the way things used to be 
 And all these memories will be erased 
 Breaking away 
 From everything that's hopeless 
 The road ahead looks wonderful 
 Breaking away 
 From everything that's hopeless 
 The road ahead looks wonderful today 
 Another day of life 
 One more chance to live for more than me 
 I'm reaching out to take the hand of Someone I can't see 
 And all these memories will be erased 
 Tonight will be the night 
 No more waiting, I've spent life waiting 
 Take this heart of mine 
 No more waiting, I give myself to You

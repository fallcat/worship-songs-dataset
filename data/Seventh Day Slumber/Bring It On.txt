Never ran never hid from anyone 
 Standing tall when all is said and done 
 If you want it you can come and get it son 
 Right on time till the casket drops 
 I never start it, but I'll always finish it 
 I may be scarred but my spirit never quits 
 Nothing you can throw I haven't seen yet 
 Never back down; we can go twelve rounds 
 Bring it on if you want it all 
 Bring it on I can take you're best shot 
 Bring it on I'm a fighter 
 I can take anything that you've got 
 We can go till the knockouts thrown 
 I know that the battles already won 
 So bring it on 
 I ain't the one so don't try and test me 
 You're talking big, but your words are empty 
 I've been clean, but I still get messy 
 I never back down; we can go twelve rounds 
 Bring it on if you want it all 
 Bring it on I can take you're best shot 
 Bring it on I'm a fighter 
 I can take anything that you've got 
 We can go till the knockouts thrown 
 I know that the battles already won 
 So bring it on 
 Never back down 
 Never back down 
 We can go twelve rounds 
 Never back down 
 Never back down 
 Right on time till the casket drops 
 Bring it on if you want it all 
 Bring it on I can take you're best shot 
 Bring it on I'm a fighter 
 I can take anything that you've got 
 We can go till the knockouts thrown 
 I know that the battles already won 
 We can go till the knockouts thrown 
 I know that the battles already won

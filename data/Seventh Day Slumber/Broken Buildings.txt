Saturate my mind with memories 
 Of the Only One Who ever loved me 
 Everything in time will fade away 
 It's left me here in broken buildings 
 I'll never know what You see in me 
 What did You see in me, what do You see in me? 
 Is there beauty in these broken buildings? 
 What did You see in me, what do You see in me? 
 You found beauty in these broken buildings 
 Moments of regret used to be 
 The thoughts that often times consumed me 
 As shadows hid the eyes that said it all 
 It's left me here in broken buildings 
 And how could I repay the priceless gift You gave? 
 I'll never understand why You would take my place 
 You saw me at my worst, and still, You never left 
 Even when my world came crashing down

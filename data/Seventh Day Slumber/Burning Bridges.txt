Set this place on fire, burn it to the ground 
 'Cause I don't want to live here anymore 
 Take away these thoughts that empty me 
 Could You take them all away? 
 Am I too blind? I can't see, it's killing me 
 I feed off abuse, nothing's changed 
 It always bleeds like this 
 The holiest of liars, what have I become? 
 I'm holding on to nothing once again 
 Addiction holds the keys to my freedom 
 Could You take it all away? 
 Am I too blind? I can't see 
 It always bleeds like this

So many nights wasted, 
 Poisoning myself 
 Guess I just hated, 
 The emptiness I felt 
 To be excepted 
 You gotta look like they do 
 But you held your hand down 
 And took me just as I am 
 Your love's like candy 
 Oh like something 
 I've never tasted before 
 And you take me places 
 I never dreamed I could go 
 Oh I've been laughed at 
 And broken in two 
 And I've felt the wrath that 
 Words of hate can do 
 Oh I've been stranded 
 And left standing in the rain 
 But you picked my head up 
 And carried me 
 Away from this place 
 Your love's like candy 
 Like something 
 I've never tasted before 
 And you take me places 
 I never dreamed I could go 
 And where would I be 
 Without you 
 Where would I go 
 Without you

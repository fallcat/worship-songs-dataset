Caroline 
 Seventh Day Slumber 
 Where do I begin? 
 There's so much I want to say to make it easier 
 Tomorrow's on its way 
 Do you beileve I want to take your painful memories? 
 I know you want to run away 
 I know that you can't see tomorrow 
 Caroline 
 Let me wipe away your tears, and give you life 
 Make you feel beautiful again 
 Caroline 
 Don't throw it all away 
 I'm here tonight, to take away your pain 
 Yesterday is gone and 
 Everything that made you cry has fallen to the ground 
 I'm here to bring you home 
 I will always take you back 
 You haven't let me down 
 I know you want to run away 
 I know that you can't see tomorrow 
 Caroline 
 Let me wipe away your tears, and give you life 
 Make you feel beautiful again 
 Caroline 
 Don't throw it all away 
 I'm here tonight, to take away your pain 
 And when you're feeling all alone and you can't go on 
 Remember I am here 
 And when you think you've gone too far 
 I'll meet you where you are 
 My arms are open wide 
 Caroline 
 Let me wipe away your tears, and give you life 
 Make you feel beautiful again 
 Caroline 
 Don't throw it all away 
 I'm here tonight, to take away your pain 
 Caroline 
 Let me wipe away your tears, and give you life 
 Make you feel beautiful again 
 Caroline 
 Don't throw it all away 
 I'm here tonight, to take away your pain 
 Caroline

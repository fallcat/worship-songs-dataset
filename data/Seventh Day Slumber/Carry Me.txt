On my knees 
 Searching within 
 I've come to the end of me 
 And I'm ready to begin 
 To find my purpose 
 To find my way 
 I'm reaching for you 
 And I am desperate 
 And I can't do this on my own 
 Won't you carry me 
 My arms are wide open 
 I'm giving everything 
 Won't you carry me 
 Oh Lord I surrender 
 I'm letting go today 
 I'm forgiven 
 'Cause you paid the price 
 I still can't seem to leave it all behind 
 All my failures 
 All of my mistakes 
 Still I'm reaching for you 
 And I am desperate 
 And I can't do this on my own 
 Won't you carry me 
 My arms are wide open 
 I'm giving everything 
 Won't you carry me 
 Oh Lord I surrender 
 I'm letting go today 
 And all of these years 
 So lost and broken 
 And all of these tears 
 I've walked alone 
 Now reaching for you 
 Won't you carry me 
 My arms are wide open 
 I'm giving everything 
 Won't you carry me 
 Oh Lord I surrender 
 I'm letting go today 
 Won't you carry me 
 My arms are wide open 
 I'm giving everything 
 Won't you carry me 
 Oh Lord I surrender 
 I'm letting go today

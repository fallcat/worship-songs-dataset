I said that one day I'd be something 
 Everyone would soon be proud of me 
 I'd sit and watch the day go by 
 Think of all the things I'd like to be 
 So many of my dreams have gone 
 Now I'm left with only emptiness 
 There's nothing that can make me better 
 Nothing that can take away this pain 
 And I 
 Wonder what you'd say if I were gone 
 Would you cry? 
 Did you even notice something wrong? 
 I often wonder what's to live for 
 I just want this pain to go away 
 All I have are fading memories 
 Pieces of my broken yesterday 
 Every drop of blood meant something 
 Every ounce He shed was shed for me 
 Here I am, I'm waiting for You, crying out 
 I've fallen to my knees 
 And I 
 Wonder what you'd say if I were gone 
 Would you cry? 
 Did you even notice something wrong? 
 And I 
 Wonder what you'd say if I were gone 
 Would you cry? 
 Did you even notice something wrong? 
 And I 
 Wonder what you'd say if I were gone 
 Would you cry? 
 Did you even notice something wrong?

She said the world wouldn't even notice 
 If she wasn't here anymore 
 So hard to be faithful 
 To a God that she's never seen before 
 And everyone's preaching 
 But no one is reaching her way 
 Now is the time to open our eyes 
 There's so many people in pain 
 Arise and take your place 
 Wake up from your comatose state 
 He's lost inside addiction 
 And images flash through his head 
 In the dark of this affliction 
 There's times that he'd rather be dead 
 And everyone's preaching 
 But no one is reaching his way 
 Now is the time to open our eyes 
 There's so many people in pain 
 Arise and take your place 
 Wake up from your comatose state 
 Now is the time to open our eyes 
 There's so many people in pain 
 Arise and take your place 
 Wake up from your comatose state

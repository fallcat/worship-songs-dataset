You might escape from everything, there's comfort in Your arms 
 I'm out of place when we're apart like drowning slowly 
 And when the music starts to fade and everyone has gone 
 I know that You'll still be here with arms out open 
 And I will run to You and crash into Your arms 
 Giving all I am, I know I'll never be alone 
 And I fall to pieces without You in my life 
 I couldn't make it on my own, can't make it on my own 
 Sometimes life seems so hard and hope is far away 
 In the middle of my storm You better hold me 
 Just the thought of You alone brings healing to my soul 
 And when I reached You took my hand and never let go 
 That's why I run to You, crash into Your arms 
 Giving all I am, I know I'll never be alone 
 And I'd fall to pieces without You in my life 
 I couldn't make it on my own, can't make it on my own 
 Crash into Your arms 
 Giving all I am, I know I'll never be alone 
 And I fall to pieces without You in my life 
 I couldn't make it on my own, can't make it on my own 
 Crash into Your arms 
 (Couldn't make it on my own)

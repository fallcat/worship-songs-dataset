Oh, I took your love for granted 
 I didn't understand 
 Daddy I had to do it my way 
 I never thought you were half a man 
 Oh, I was so confused then 
 And I just couldn't see 
 Everything that you were doing 
 You were doing just for me 
 How do I say daddy please forgive me? 
 How do I prove my love to you? 
 How do I say daddy please forgive me, yeah yeah 
 Daddy I'm sorry I never knew 
 You gave me all I wanted 
 You even gave me life 
 When I didn't deserve it 
 You made that sacrifice 
 Oh, I was so confused then 
 And I just couldn't see 
 Everything that you were doing 
 You were doing just for me 
 How do I say daddy please forgive me? 
 How do I prove my love to you? 
 How do I say daddy please forgive me, yeah yeah 
 Daddy I'm sorry I never knew 
 x2 
 Daddy I'm sorry I never knew 
 Daddy I'm sorry I never knew, no no 
 Forgive me. I'm sorry I never knew 
 Daddy I'm sorry I never knew 
 I never knew

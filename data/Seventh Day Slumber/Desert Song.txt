This is my prayer in the desert 
 When all that's within me feels dry 
 This is my prayer in my hunger and need 
 My God is a God who provides 
 And this is my prayer in the fire 
 In weakness or trial or pain 
 There is a faith proved of more worth than gold 
 So refine me Lord through the flames 
 And I will bring praise, I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 And I will rejoice, I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 This is my prayer in the battle 
 When triumph is still on its way 
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ 
 So firm on His promise I'll stand 
 And I will bring praise, I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 And I will rejoice, I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 All of my life, 
 In every season 
 You are still God 
 I have a reason to sing 
 I have a reason to worship 
 (x2) 
 And I will bring praise, I will bring praise 
 No weapon formed against me shall remain 
 And I will rejoice, I will declare 
 God is my victory and He is here 
 (x2) 
 And I will declare 
 My God is here

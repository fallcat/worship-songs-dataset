Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord 
 We will wait upon the Lord 
 We will wait upon the Lord 
 Our God, You reign forever 
 Our hope, our Strong Deliverer 
 You are the everlasting God 
 The everlasting God 
 You do not faint 
 You won't grow weary 
 Our God, You reign forever 
 Our hope, our Strong Deliverer 
 You are the everlasting God 
 The everlasting God 
 You do not faint 
 You won't grow weary 
 You're the defender of the weak 
 You comfort those in need 
 You lift us up on wings like eagles

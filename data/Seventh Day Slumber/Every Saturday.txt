Saturdays have never been the same 
 And I still can't believe you're gone 
 So many things I wish that I could say 
 I guess the hardest part of moving on 
 Are these memories that have overtaken me 
 Once again I'm right here on my knees 
 I'm barely hanging on 
 With all these empty feelings 
 I'm hurting in so many ways 
 Though I can't begin 
 To understand the reason 
 I still believe that you're God 
 Saturdays have never been the same 
 That memory keeps repeating in my mind 
 The ringing phone, the call that changed my world 
 An emptiness that words cannot define 
 Are these memories that have overtaken me 
 Once again I'm right here on my knees 
 I'm barely hanging on 
 With all these empty feelings 
 I'm hurting in so many ways 
 Though I can't begin 
 To understand the reason 
 I still believe that you're God 
 And as you're crying I cry with you 
 I'll never leave, I'll carry you through 
 And can't you see that I was always there 
 These ashes of pain will fade 
 I'm barely hanging on 
 With all these empty feelings 
 I'm hurting in so many ways 
 And though I can't begin 
 To understand the reason 
 I still believe that you're God 
 I'm barely hanging on 
 With all these empty feelings 
 I'm hurting in so many ways 
 And though I can't begin 
 To understand the reason 
 I still believe that you're God

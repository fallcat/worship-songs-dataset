You are good 
 You are good 
 When there's nothing good in me 
 You are love 
 You are love 
 On display for all to see 
 You are light 
 You are light 
 When the darkness closes in 
 You are hope 
 You are hope 
 You have covered all my sin 
 You are peace 
 You are peace 
 When my fear is crippling 
 You are true 
 You are true 
 Ever in my wandering 
 You are joy 
 You are joy 
 You're the reason that I sing 
 You are life 
 You are life 
 In You death has lost its sting 
 Oh, I'm running to Your arms 
 I'm running to Your arms 
 The riches of Your love 
 Will always be enough 
 Nothing compares to Your embrace 
 Light of the world forever reign 
 You are more 
 You are more 
 Than my words will ever say 
 You are Lord 
 You are Lord 
 All creation will proclaim 
 You are here 
 You are here 
 In Your presence I'm made whole 
 You are God 
 You are God 
 Of all else I'm letting go 
 Oh, I'm running to Your arms 
 I'm running to Your arms 
 The riches of Your love 
 Will always be enough 
 Nothing compares to Your embrace 
 Light of the world forever reign 
 (x2) 
 My heart will sing 
 No other name 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 (x3) 
 Oh, I'm running to Your arms 
 I'm running to Your arms 
 The riches of Your love 
 Will always be enough 
 Nothing compares to Your embrace 
 Light of the world forever reign 
 My heart will sing 
 No other name 
 Jesus, Jesus 
 (x2)

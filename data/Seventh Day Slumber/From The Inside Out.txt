1,000 times I've failed 
 Still your mercy remains 
 Should I stumble again 
 I'm caught in your grace 
 Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades 
 Never-ending your glory goes beyond all fame 
 Your will above all else 
 My purpose remains 
 The art of losing myself 
 In bringing you praise 
 Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades 
 Never-ending your glory goes beyond all fame 
 My heart and my soul 
 I give you control 
 Consume me from the inside out 
 Let justice and praise become my embrace 
 To love you from the inside out 
 Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades 
 Never-ending your glory goes beyond all fame 
 And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise from the inside out 
 Oh My soul cries out 
 My heart and my soul 
 I give you control 
 Consume me from the inside out 
 Let justice and praise become my embrace 
 To love you from the inside out 
 Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades 
 Never-ending your glory goes beyond all fame 
 And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise from the inside out 
 My soul cries out 
 Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades 
 Never-ending your glory goes beyond all fame 
 And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise from the inside out 
 My soul cries out 
 Oh, My soul Cries Out

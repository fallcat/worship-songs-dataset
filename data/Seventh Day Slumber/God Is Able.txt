 Greater than all we ask

 Far above all we know 
 Far above all we hope 
 He has done great things 
 Lifted up

 In His name 
 We overcome 
 For the Lord 
 Our God is able

 He will go before 
 He will never leave us 
 He will never leave us 
 God is for us 
 He has open arms 
 He will never fail us 
 He will never fail us

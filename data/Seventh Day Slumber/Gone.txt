I'm tired of being who they say 
 So tired of always running away 
 Confused inside this maze 
 I never thought I'd make it out 
 Hiding secrets deep inside 
 I never thought they'd come to light 
 I'm opened up for all to see 
 And now there's nothing left for me to hide 
 We're so lost, we're so gone 
 We're so far from arms I never thought could reach 
 Your Blood Stain, Amazing Grace 
 You pulled me from the edge of an everlasting sleep 
 Wasted nights and wasted days 
 Wasted moments wasting away 
 Precious time you can't regain 
 You wonder where your life has gone 
 See it written on your face 
 Every worry and disdain 
 What's it gonna take for you to leave 
 The baggage you've been carrying so long 
 We're so lost, we're so gone 
 We're so far from arms I never thought could reach 
 Your Blood Stain, Amazing Grace 
 You pulled me from the edge of an everlasting sleep 
 I never realized I was always wanting more 
 Broke my fingers as I grabbed the slamming door 
 Insanity was making it so hard for me to see 
 Couldn't sleep couldn't eat I had no piece of mind 
 Nothing I could take would get me by; I'm rid of them 
 Thank you, God, for giving me new life 
 We're so lost, we're so gone 
 So far from arms I never thought could reach 
 Your Blood Stain, Amazing Grace 
 You pulled me from the edge of an everlasting sleep

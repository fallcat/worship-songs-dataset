Your makeup is running down your face again 
 Hollow 'cause you've let so many in 
 Wake up, wake you can't keep hiding the pain 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 Goodbye 
 Tears fall from your eyes 
 They wash away your disguise 
 Can't you see the battle's in your mind? 
 (In your mind) 
 You're holding onto the past 
 It's only holding you back 
 Now's the time to say goodbye 
 Falling for the lines again 
 You're falling for the lines that bring you pain 
 It's wasted time and leaves you dead inside 
 Don't want to feel, but these wounds are real 
 Do you believe me? 
 Do you believe me? 
 Goodbye 
 Tears fall from your eyes 
 They wash away your disguise 
 Can't you see the battle's in your mind? 
 (In your mind) 
 You're holding onto the past 
 It's only holding you back 
 Now's the time to say goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Goodbye 
 Tears fall from your eyes 
 They wash away your disguise 
 Can't you see the battle's in your mind? 
 (In your mind) 
 You're holding onto the past 
 It's only holding you back 
 Now's the time to say goodbye 
 Goodbye

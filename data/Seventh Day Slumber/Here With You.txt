Well I've been beat and I've been laughed at 
 And I've been drugged through strings of pain 
 And I've had people turn their back on me 
 I have been called every name 
 And I've felt lonliness and hunger 
 And I felt helpless and betrayed 
 And all the hurtful things you've done to me 
 You know my love has never changed 
 You drove the nails through my hand 
 I never gave up on you 
 You placed the thorns on my head 
 But I'm right here with you 
 I'm here with you 
 Well I took the sting of torture 
 So you wouldn't feel the pain 
 Well I was nailed upon a cross for you 
 And child I'd do it all again 
 You drove the nails through my hand 
 I never gave up on you 
 You placed the thorns on my head 
 But I'm right here with you 
 I'm here with you 
 You drove the nails through my hand 
 I never gave up on you 
 You placed the thorns on my head 
 But I'm right here with you 
 I'm here with you

I lie awake I can't escape the monster that I have become 
 Breaking down inside this cage 
 Tell me you're still holding on 
 Hold on for one more day 
 Can't leave me like this 
 Hiding from the truth that I know deep inside I can't ignore 
 (Hiding from the truth that I) 
 I'm about to break-down inside 
 I waste away but you keep holding on 
 The shadows of my past mistakes are mocking me I feel so broken 
 Wish that I could turn the page then my past would all be gone 
 I know that I'm to blame I can't erase it 
 Haunted by the pain that I have caused to those that I love the most 
 (Haunted by the pain I caused) 
 I'm about to break-down inside 
 I waste away but you keep holding on 
 No one knows me better you've seen my darkest side 
 So filthy, so shattered, dying to be alive 
 God please save me breathe your life in me 
 No one knows me better, no one knows, no one knows 
 I'm about to break-down inside 
 I waste away but you keep holding on

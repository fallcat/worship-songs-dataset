He is jealous for me 
 Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree 
 Bending beneath 
 The weight of His wind and mercy 
 When all of a sudden I am unaware 
 Of these afflictions eclipsed by glory 
 I realize just how beautiful You are 
 And how great Your affections are for me 
 Oh, how He loves us all 
 Oh, how He loves us, how He loves us all 
 He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 He is jealous for me 
 Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree 
 Bending beneath 
 The weight of his wind and mercy 
 When all of a sudden I am unaware 
 Of these afflictions eclipsed by glory 
 I realize just how beautiful You are 
 And how great Your affections are for me 
 He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 We are His portion and He is our prize 
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes 
 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking 
 Heaven meets earth like a very first kiss 
 My heart's beating wildly inside of my chest 
 I don't have time to maintain these regrets 
 When I think about the way 
 He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us all 
 Oh, how He loves us, how He loves us all

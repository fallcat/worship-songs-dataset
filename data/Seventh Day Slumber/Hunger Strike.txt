I don't mind stealing bread from the mouths of decadents 
 I can't feed on the powerless when my cups already overfilled 
 But it's on the table; the fire's cooking 
 And they're farming babies; while slaves are all working 
 Blood is on the table; their mouths are all choking 
 I'm going hungry 
 I don't mind stealing bread from the mouth of decadents 
 I can't feed on the powerless when my cups already overfilled 
 But it's on the table; the fire's cooking 
 And they're farming babies; the slaves are all working 
 Blood is on the table; their mouths are all choking 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry yeah... 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry yeah... 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry yeah... 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry yeah... 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry... 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry yeah 
 I don't mind stealing bread; oh I don't mind 
 Oh... I don't mind stealing bread; oh I don't mind 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry yeah... 
 I'm going hungry; I'm going hungry yeah...

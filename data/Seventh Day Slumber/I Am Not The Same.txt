You restore the wasted years 
 You build the broken walls 
 Your love replaces fear 
 Oh, Your mercy makes us whole 
 Adopted, healed and lifted 
 I am not the same 
 I'm a new creation 
 I am not the same anymore 
 I am not ashamed 
 I will not be shaken 
 I am not the same anymore 
 I bow before Your cross 
 This broken life made new 
 Amazed at all You are 
 And who I am in You 
 Adopted, healed and lifted 
 Forgiven, found and rescued 
 I am not the same 
 I'm a new creation 
 I am not the same anymore 
 I am not ashamed 
 I will not be shaken 
 I am not the same anymore 
 You have overcome 
 It is finished, it is done 
 Now my heart is finally free 
 Every chain undone 
 By the power of the Son 
 Risen Savior, reigning King 
 Forevermore, You reign 
 Forevermore, You reign 
 I am not the same 
 I'm a new creation 
 I am not the same anymore 
 I am not ashamed 
 I will not be shaken 
 I am not the same anymore 
 You have overcome 
 It is finished, it is done 
 Now my heart is finally free 
 Every chain undone 
 By the power of the Son 
 Risen Savior, reigning King 
 Reign in me

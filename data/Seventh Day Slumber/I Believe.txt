Well I'm living with a power and I have never felt this way before 
 Oh my mind is thinking clearly now 
 The chains are broken and I'm standing tall 
 Oh the Lord has never left me 
 He's always there to catch me when I fall 
 I believe in Jesus. Oh He's Lord of Lords 
 And King of Kings 
 I believe in Jesus. He rescued me 
 It really wasn't long ago that I was bound by chains and trampled on 
 I felt like all my days were numbered 
 I felt so all alone, but I was wrong 
 Oh the Lord has never left me. 
 He's always there to catch me when I fall 
 That's where I find my strength. Falling down like rain. 
 It washes over me. He's taken me so far. 
 From where I used to be. He's my everything. 
 That's why I believe...

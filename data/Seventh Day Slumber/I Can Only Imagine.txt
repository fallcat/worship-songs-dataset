I can only imagine 
 What it will be like 
 When I walk 
 By Your side 
 I can only imagine 
 What my eyes will see 
 When Your face 
 Is before me 
 I can only imagine 
 Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel 
 Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still 
 Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall 
 Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all 
 I can only imagine 
 I can only imagine 
 When that day comes 
 And I find myself 
 Standing in the Son 
 I can only imagine 
 When all I can do 
 Is forever 
 Forever worship You 
 I can only imagine

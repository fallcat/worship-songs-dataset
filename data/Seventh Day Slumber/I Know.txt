Wonder what can be so bad 
 That it makes you want to die 
 I wonder what could be so tragic 
 Makes you want to take your life 
 You have your Savior on the cross 
 While you sit on the throne 
 Put yourself up on that cross 
 Put your Savior on the throne 
 And I know it's hard to take what's happening 
 And I know life is tough sometimes 
 And I know it seems like there's no hope for you 
 And I know your life is worth more than you can see 
 It's hard to see beyond your pain 
 When you feel so dead inside 
 It's hard to see what you've been given 
 It's hard to find the hope in life 
 And I know it's hard to take what's happening 
 And I know life is tough sometimes 
 And I know it seems like there's no hope for you 
 And I know your life is worth more than you can see 
 And I say look at Jesus' hands 
 Those scars are there for you 
 You know He understands 
 What you're going through

Well I'm living with these old lies 
 And I'm stuck back here in yesterday 
 Keep your head up it'll get better 
 That's all I hear but I'm still drifting 
 I said myself for winds of fortune 
 Well I'm sorry but there's no end today 
 And body's getting tired 
 Guess I'll kill myself and ease the pain 
 I cannot take another moment 
 Do I just lay back be crucified 
 I want to believe in something 
 Man I feel like I've just wasted away 
 I gotta believe in something 
 Oh... before I'm dead 
 Man I've traveled every highway 
 Now just can't seem to find the one that's right 
 And I've burned that bridge behind 
 I want my sanity, I just want my piece of mind 
 I cannot take another moment 
 Do I just lay back be crucified 
 I want to believe in something 
 Man I feel like I've just wasted away 
 I gotta believe in something 
 Oh... before I'm dead

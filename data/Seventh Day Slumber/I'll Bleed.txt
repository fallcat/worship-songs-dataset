You think too much of yourself 
 But you're reality's fake 
 And there is no one who can tell you anything 
 If you could see how you look 
 The spineless person we see 
 I wonder if that's who you really want to be 
 And you'll never see the best in me 
 Your laughing while I'm bleeding 
 Oh I won't give up 
 I'm going so much higher than I've ever gone 
 I'm reaching so much higher 
 I'm feeling so alive 
 A burning fire deep inside 
 You rather choke on your words 
 Instead of saying your wrong 
 The things you say about me only make me strong 
 You'll never see the best in me 
 Your laughing while I'm bleeding 
 Oh I won't give up 
 I'm going so much higher than I've ever gone 
 I'm reaching so much higher 
 I'm feeling so alive 
 A burning fire deep inside 
 I watched you bleed... I watched you fade away 
 I watched you sink... down to the ocean floor 
 I hope one day you'll see the truth 
 Only God can save you; you're right where you belong 
 Oh I won't give up 
 I'm going so much higher than I've ever gone 
 I'm reaching so much higher 
 I'm feeling so alive 
 A burning fire deep inside 
 Oh I won't give up 
 I'm going so much higher than I've ever gone 
 I'm reaching so much higher 
 I'm feeling so alive 
 A burning fire deep inside

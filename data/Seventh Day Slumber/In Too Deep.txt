I guess the wounds run so deep 
 I can't see how they've infected me 
 Controlling me 
 I've wasted away recalling pain from yesterday 
 It's killing me 
 And I'm reaching out 
 Can't save myself 
 I'm in too deep 
 As waves crash down 
 It's getting harder to breathe 
 I'm reaching out 
 God save me now 
 I'm in too deep 
 Make these memories fade 
 'Cause I can't live like this for one more day 
 It's too much to take 
 My innocence lost 
 Ripped away no matter what the cost 
 You took it all 
 And I'm reaching out 
 Can't save myself 
 I'm in too deep 
 As waves crash down 
 It's getting harder to breathe 
 I'm reaching out 
 God save me now 
 I'm in too deep 
 I'm fading away 
 I'm in too deep 
 I can't see through the haze as darkness closes in 
 Somebody wake me up 
 Can't save myself 
 I'm in too deep 
 As waves crash down 
 It's getting harder to breathe 
 I'm reaching out 
 God save me now 
 I'm in too deep

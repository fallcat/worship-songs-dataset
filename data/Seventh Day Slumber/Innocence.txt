Something I'm not supposed to talk about 
 The way you violated me 
 Something that I could've lived without 
 The way you put your hands all over me 
 I wonder do you lie awake and think at night? 
 How you tore my innocence in two 
 I wonder do you cry yourself to sleep at night? 
 'Cause I can tell you it's what you made me do 
 And I can't get back my innocence 
 I can't get back my innocence 
 How could you steal my innocence? 
 How could you steal my innocence? 
 Sometimes I think about what I would do 
 If I ever saw your face again 
 So many untold stories only you can tell 
 Guess I'll just let God contend with you 
 And I can't get back my innocence 
 I can't get back my innocence 
 How could you steal my innocence? 
 How could you steal my innocence? 
 I can't get back my innocence 
 I can't get back my innocence 
 How could you steal my innocence? 
 How could you steal my innocence? 
 God gave me back my innocence 
 God gave me back my innocence 
 God gave my life back to me 
 God gave me back my innocence

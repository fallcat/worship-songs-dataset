Jada stands on the edge of a mountain 
 Jada see's freedom waiting in the wind 
 Jada stands on the edge of a mountain 
 Jada don't know that that's not a leap of faith 
 Jada thinks all the ones that jumped before her 
 Were freedom bound, but she don't know they lost it all 
 Jada thinks that her chains can't be broken 
 Jada don't know, someone died to set her free 
 Jada stands on the edge of a mountain 
 Jada see's freedom waiting in the wind 
 Jada stands on the edge of a mountain 
 Jada don't know that that's not a leap of faith

Knows my name 
 Another life all the that You restored 
 I felt like giving up, it was You who took me in 
 You heard the cries of my broken heart 
 You didn't turn away, I'm forever in Your debt 
 And the Maker of heaven and earth 
 Knows me by my name 
 The Giver of life, the One who makes nation's tremble 
 He's mighty in battle and I, I still can't believe 
 The One who made darkness and lights 
 Set the stars in the sky knows my name 
 I'm trying to see myself the way You do 
 Sometimes it just so hard, there are days I am so ashamed 
 And You are the place that I can run and hide 
 And listen to Your heartbeat, it's enough just to hear you breathe 
 And the Maker of heaven and earth 
 Knows me by my name 
 The Giver of life, the One who makes nation's tremble 
 He's mighty in battle and I, I still can't believe 
 The One who made darkness and lights 
 Set the stars in the sky knows my name 
 And I bow before Your Throne, oh, King of glory 
 I sing, holy is Your name, You alone are worthy 
 Giver of life, You make nation's tremble 
 You're mighty in battle and I, I still can't believe 
 You're One who made darkness and lights 
 Set the stars in the sky knows my name 
 The Giver of life 'cause You make nation's tremble 
 He's mighty in battle and I, I still can't believe 
 The One who made darkness and lights 
 Set the stars in the sky knows my name, my name 
 He knows my name

Lost in the game 
 Finally I can say I'm proud of me 
 No hope at all 
 A day I believed would never come 
 No one to blame 
 The shadows of my past have been erased 
 A life that only God himself could change 
 I never dreamed that I could feel this way 
 Don't wake me please 
 I've finally found the place where I belong 
 Only one regret 
 All those years I lost 
 For nothing at all 
 Laughing in pain 
 Searching for a reason to exist 
 World torn apart 
 Excuses left me breathless and ashamed 
 Slipping away 
 I found a purpose that's worth fighting for 
 The memories don't haunt me anymore

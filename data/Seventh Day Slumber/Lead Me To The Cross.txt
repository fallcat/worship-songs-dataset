Savior I come 
 Quiet my soul remember 
 Redemptions hill 
 Where Your blood was spilled 
 For my ransom 
 Everything I once held dear 
 I count it all as lost 
 Lead me to the cross 
 Where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees 
 Lord I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself 
 I belong to You 
 Lead me, lead me to the cross 
 You were as I 
 Tempted and trialed 
 You are 
 The word became flesh 
 Bore my sin and death 
 Now you're risen 
 To your heart 
 To your heart 
 Lead me to your heart 
 Lead me to your heart

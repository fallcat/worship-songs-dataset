Come see the city lights 
 High above a perfect sky 
 You know they're waiting here for you 
 Everybody's gotta have a dream 
 Some things aren't what they seem 
 The brightest lights often hide the bitter truth 
 You can't see the sun/Son anymore 
 Never finding what you're searching for 
 You're alive but still you feel so dead inside 
 Just like you're living a lie 
 Behind these lights 
 This music city is filled with stars 
 Not everyone is who they say they are 
 They live like puppets on a string 
 Empty promises and shattered lives 
 A fake smile for you're disguise 
 This life isn't how you thought it'd be 
 You can't see the sun/Son anymore 
 Never finding what you're searching for 
 You're alive but still you feel so dead inside 
 Just like you're living a lie 
 Behind these lights 
 You find the meaning at your door 
 With over half a million souls 
 And still you feel alone 
 And it only costs your soul 
 So many faces in the crowd 
 Screaming out your name so loud 
 If this is what it's all about 
 Then you won't see the sun/Son anymore 
 Never finding what you're searching for 
 You're alive but still you feel so dead inside 
 Just like you're living a lie 
 Behind these lights

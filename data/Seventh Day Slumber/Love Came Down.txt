If my heart is overwhelmed 
 And I cannot hear Your voice 
 I will run to what is true 
 Though I cannot see 
 If the storms have come my way 
 And the road ahead gets steep 
 I will lift these hands in faith 
 I will believe 
 I'll remind myself 
 Of all that You've done 
 And the life I have 
 Because of Your son 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 And I am Yours 
 I'm forever Yours 
 Mountains high or valley low 
 I sing out, remind my soul 
 That I am Yours 
 I'm forever Yours 
 When my heart is filled with hope 
 And every promise comes my way 
 When I feel Your hands of grace 
 Rest upon me 
 Staying desperate for You, God 
 Staying humble at Your feet 
 I will lift these hands in praise 
 I will believe 
 I'll remind myself 
 Of all that You've done 
 And the life I have 
 Because of Your son 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 And I am Yours 
 I'm forever Yours 
 Mountains high or valley low 
 I sing out, remind my soul 
 That I am Yours 
 I'm forever Yours 
 I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 All my days 
 Jesus, I am Yours 
 You rescued me 
 You set me free 
 And I am forever Yours 
 Love came down and rescued me 
 Love came down and set me free 
 And I am Yours 
 I'm forever Yours 
 Mountains high or valley low 
 I sing out, remind my soul 
 That I am Yours 
 I'm forever Yours 
 I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 All my days 
 Jesus, I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 I am Yours 
 All my days 
 I am forever Yours

How did I get so far from the promises I made? 
 Life it seems so dark compared to yesterday 
 Everything I had the gift that I received 
 Is slipping through my hands 
 Now it's only make believe 
 I'm fading away and I feel like I can't breathe 
 Tomorrow's gone. How long until I break? 
 I'm fading away and I'm trapped inside of me 
 Tomorrow's gone. How long until I break? 
 All the things I chose that slowly took Your place 
 Are laughing back at me and I can't make them go away 
 My life is crashing down, another tragedy 
 Another broken dream, now it's only make believe

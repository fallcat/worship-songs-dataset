Mama sits at her bed side with watery eyes 
 And her son ain't been home in a week 
 She tries to tell herself, that everythings all right 
 But I can see, the pain in mama's eyes 
 Mama grabs her bible and she read another verse 
 And prays to God her boy will be home soon 
 Mama wont give up (x2) 
 All the odds are stacked against her 
 But that's not a reason enough 
 Mama wont give up 
 There's a knock at the door, and the clock reads 4am 
 And her son is back but he's beaten black and blue 
 And he says Mama I can't take this life no more 
 I'm here to tell you bye for good, I'm through 
 Mama grabs her bible and she reads her son a verse 
 She says boy you can do all things to Christ who strengthens you 
 Mama wont give up (x2) 
 All the odds are stacked against her 
 But that's not a reason enough 
 Mama wont give up 
 Well I know this story about, mama and her son all too well 
 That long, ago that beaten boy was me 
 But through the Lords great love and mercies that never failed 
 I'm here today to tell you that Jesus saves 
 And He wont give up 
 Jesus won't give up 
 Though you turn your back against Him 
 That's not a reason enough 
 Jesus won't give up 
 He wont give up 
 He wont give up

I don't know what to think about me anymore, 
 'Cause I am still the same as always. 
 Here I am again, that same old broken man. 
 I can't make it on my own. I need You. 
 And I am not afraid of anything anymore. 
 And I am not ashamed, the masquerade has ended. 
 And I will stand for You even if I lose it all. 
 Cause nothing really matters, 
 You are all that matters, Lord. 
 As messed up as I am, still You bring me in. 
 You take me in Your arms and hold me. 
 The worthlessness I feel, You make it disappear. 
 You are always there, You're endless. 
 I don't know what to think about me anymore. 
 'Cause I am still the same as always.

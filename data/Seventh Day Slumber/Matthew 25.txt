I call myself a man of God 
 While laughing at my brother 
 I crossed the heart of a hungry man 
 Instead of giving him some bread 
 And what I say 
 And what I do 
 Are not the same anymore 
 And who I slay, who I betray 
 Lord have mercy on my soul 
 And you were hungry 
 And you were thirsty 
 You were lonely you were cold 
 And you were hurting, you were dying 
 I just left you all alone 
 I watched a mother who had her children 
 They all three crying out for help 
 But know one heard them 
 And I just passed them and 
 I screamed "Lady get a job!" 
 She took her own life 
 Under the bridge that day 
 While her children sat and cried 
 I could have told her about my loving father 
 Instead I spit in Jesus face, when I heard her voice 
 What you do unto the least of them 
 You do unto me 
 And when you see one of my hurting children 
 I want you to snee 
 'Cause I was hungry 
 And I was thirsty 
 I was lonely I was cold 
 And that was me hurting, that was me dying 
 And you just left me all alone 
 I call myself a man of God 
 While laughing at my brother

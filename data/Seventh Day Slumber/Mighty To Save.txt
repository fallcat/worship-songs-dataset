Everyone needs compassion 
 A love that's never failing 
 Let mercy fall on me 
 Everyone needs forgiveness 
 The kindness of a Savior 
 The hope of nations 
 Savior 
 He can move the mountains 
 My God is mighty to save 
 He is mighty to save 
 Forever

 He rose and conquered the grave 
 Jesus conquered the grave 
 So take me as You find me 
 All my fears and failures 
 Fill my life again 
 I give my life to follow 
 Everything I believe in 
 Now I surrender (I surrender) 
 Savior 
 He can move the mountains 
 My God is mighty to save 
 He is mighty to save 
 Forever

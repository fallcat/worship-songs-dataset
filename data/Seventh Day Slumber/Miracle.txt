Here it comes, I see the rain again 
 All around me, dark clouds are forming 
 Oh, my God I feel the pain again 
 This is a storm too strong to bear 
 A rail of white dust and a demon's lie 
 Load the shotgun as the tears fall from my eyes 
 My mind is racing as my dreams shoot through my veins 
 I need a savior who can help me through the pain 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 My heart starts pumping and my left are feels this pain 
 I hit my knees I know I've lost this losing game 
 I scream to Jesus can you make me whole again 
 My heart stops pumping, then the warm touch of a friend 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I was blind but now I see the light 
 The life I've lived oh, Lord I know it wasn't right 
 I feel my heart start slowly pumping up again 
 I'm a miracle 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh

On the outside all we see is clay that hides the perfect lie 
 But no one really knows the pain inside 
 I understand how much it hurts to be the only one who's never seen 
 Like missing pages in a magazine 
 No one knows you anymore 
 You're lost inside the walls you've built 
 No one knows you anymore 
 A prison deep within your soul 
 But there is one who sees it all 
 He'll give you life you never dreamed 
 He can see the pain underneath your skin 
 It's hard to see you fading nothing that I do can bring you back 
 I pray to God that you don't fade away 
 Your addiction is a symptom of a lost and dying soul 
 And without Jesus there's no hope at all 
 There's s much more 
 This is not the end 
 It's all in your hands 
 Don't throw it all away 
 A beautiful life with so much to give 
 The image of God 
 Underneath your skin 
 The beauty of God 
 Underneath your skin

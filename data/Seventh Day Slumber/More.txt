Do you really wanna know me, not just where I live? 
 Do you really want to know, not just by the color of my skin? 
 Do you really want to know me, not just by the things I did? 
 If you really got to know me, it might take a little time... 
 'Cause I am more than what I look like 
 I am more than where I've been 
 I am more than what they say about me 
 I'm more, I'm more than what you see... 
 Do you really want to know him, the man that lives under that bridge? 
 Do you really want to know him and hear about the life he's lived? 
 If you really got to know him, you might be just a bit surprised 
 How he lost his job in 1983 and how that cancer got his wife. 
 He is more than what he looks like, 
 He is more than where he's been, 
 He's more than where he's ended up to be. 
 He's more, he's more than what you see. 
 I am more than what I look like 
 I am more than what I look like 
 I am more than what I look like 
 I am more than where I've been 
 I am more than what they say about me 
 I'm more, I'm more...

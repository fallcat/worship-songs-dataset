Once again I find myself asking the same old question 
 Why in the world have I been so stupid 
 Only to be let down 
 Only to be let down again 
 I thought I could make it on my own 
 Forgetting that I am 
 Forgetting that I am just a man 
 I put my trust in my so called friends 
 Only to be let down 
 Only to be let down again 
 But 
 You were there all the time 
 Waiting for me to reach out and take your hand 
 You picked me off of the ground 
 You set me back on my feet 
 You are my bestfriend 
 You're always right here by myside 
 Ready to cheer me on 
 You are my bestfriend 
 I can't make it on my own 
 I relize I am just 
 I relize I am just a man 
 So I put my trust where I know it's secure 
 I'll never be let 
 I'll never be let again 
 (Chorus x2) Once again I find myself asking the same old question 
 Why in the world have I been so stupid 
 Only to be let down 
 Only to be let down again 
 I thought I could make it on my own 
 Forgetting that I am 
 Forgetting that I am just a man 
 I put my trust in my so called friends 
 Only to be let down 
 Only to be let down again 
 But 
 You were there all the time 
 Waiting for me to reach out and take your hand 
 You picked me off of the ground 
 You set me back on my feet 
 You are my bestfriend 
 You're always right here by myside 
 Ready to cheer me on 
 You are my bestfriend 
 I can't make it on my own 
 I relize I am just 
 I relize I am just a man 
 So I put my trust where I know it's secure 
 I'll never be let 
 I'll never be let again

A beautiful lie was killing me 
 I can't believe I'm sober, I can't believe I'm clean 
 It's been a while since I felt this close to home 
 I know the fight's not over but I don't have to fight alone 
 And I've got to let You know, I just have to let You know 
 You made me feel like I belong, You gave me the strength to carry on 
 And I feel so alive since that part of me died 
 I couldn't make it on my own but with You there's nothing I can't do 
 Until the day I die I thank You for my life 
 This feeling's so hard to explain 
 I know that I said thank You but there's more I want to say 
 Like I'm sorry for the time's I lied to You 
 And all those nights You worry, the pain I put You through 
 And I've got to let You know, I just have to let You know 
 You made me feel like I belong, You gave me the strength to carry on 
 And I feel so alive since that part of me died 
 I couldn't make it on my own but with You there's nothing I can't do 
 Until the day I die I thank You for my life 
 If I could change the mistakes I've made, turn back the hands of time 
 And erase all the nights I heard You, the tear I made You cry 
 You made me feel like I belong, You gave me the strength to carry on 
 And I feel so alive since that part of me died 
 I couldn't make it on my own but with You there's nothing I can't do 
 Until the day I die I thank You for my life

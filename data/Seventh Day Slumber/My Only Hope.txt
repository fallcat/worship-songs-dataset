The silence of what's left is waking me, I never sleep 
 And what was here before is fading fast 
 And now it's gone away, away 
 So I can pray this all will end 
 Take it a million miles away 
 I can't go through this again 
 You're my only hope 
 The deepest parts of me are crying out for something more 
 Blind reality has lead me here 
 Have I thrown it all away, away

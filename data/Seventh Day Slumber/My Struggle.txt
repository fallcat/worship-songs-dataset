Must be some mistake 
 'Cause I'm not worth the price you paid. 
 With every passing hour 
 I convince myself that you saw something in me. 
 But I can hear them still, 
 As the whispers laced with hatred fill the room. 
 Guess I'm wasting my time 
 How could you love a man like me? 
 Lord I need your strength 
 'Cause I am weak and falling to my knees. 
 Who is on my side? 
 'Cause I can't tell my friends from enemies. 
 Filling up with pain. 
 Bitterness controls the air I breathe. 
 What am I fighting for? 
 Do you have a plan for me? 
 Must be some mistake 
 'Cause I'm not worth the price you paid. 
 With every passing hour, 
 I convince myself that you saw something in me. 
 But I can hear them still, 
 As the whispers laced with hatred fill the room. 
 Guess I'm wasting my time 
 How could you love a man like me? 
 Must be some mistake. 
 'Cause I'm not worth the price you paid.

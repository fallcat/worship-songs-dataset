Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 Your perfect love is casting out fear 
 And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life 
 I won't turn back 
 I know You are near 
 I will fear no evil 
 For my God is with me 
 And if my God is with me 
 Whom then shall I fear? 
 Whom then shall I fear? 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Lord, You never let go of me 
 I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on 
 A glorious light beyond all compare 
 There will be an end to the struggles 
 But until that day comes 
 We'll live to know You here on the earth 
 I will fear no evil 
 For my God is with me 
 And if my God is with me 
 Whom then shall I fear? 
 Whom then shall I fear? 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Lord, You never let go of me 
 I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on 
 And there will be an end to the struggles 
 But until that day comes 
 Still I will praise You, still I will praise You 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Lord, You never let go 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Through the calm and through the storm 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 In every high and every low 
 Oh no, You never let go 
 Lord, You never let go of me 
 You never let go of me

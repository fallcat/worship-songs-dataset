Living life so fast you can't slow down 
 You feel like time is slipping away 
 So you're drowning out your tomorrows 
 And the melody of pain is on replay 
 I was lost in that place too long 
 Don't believe the lies that say you're too far gone 
 And I won't stand and watch you fall 
 Fade away and lose it all 
 It's time to let go of the things you've done 
 'Cause you're never too far gone 
 You're lost inside the memory of your past 
 It's like a knife-cut right to the soul 
 So focused on your imperfections 
 That you hide behind a mask so no one knows 
 I was lost in that place too long 
 You can't believe the lies that say you're too far gone 
 And I won't stand and watch you fall 
 Fade away and lose it all 
 It's time to let go of the things you've done 
 'Cause you're never too far gone 
 I know you feel ashamed, feel all alone 
 You see your life crashing and you're losing control 
 But it's not too late, you don't have to fall 
 Don't believe the lies that say you're too far gone 
 I was lost in that place too long 
 You can't believe the lies that say you're too far gone 
 And I won't stand and watch you fall 
 Fade away and lose it all 
 It's time to let go of the things you've done 
 'Cause you're never too far gone

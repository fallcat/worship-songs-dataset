Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims 
 I've heard upon this earth, speaks righteousness for me 
 And stands in my defense; Jesus it's Your blood 
 What can wash away our sins? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can wash us pure as snow 
 Welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Nothing but Your blood, nothing but Your blood 
 King Jesus 
 Your cross testifies in grace 
 Tells the father's heart to make a way for us 
 Now boldly we approach; not earthly confidence, Jesus it's Your blood 
 Your cross testifies in grace 
 Tells the father's heart to make a way for us 
 Now boldly we approach; not earthly confidence, it's only by Your blood 
 We thank you for your blood, Lord we thank you for your blood, King Jesus 
 Praise you for your blood, it's only by your blood 
 What can wash away our sins? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can wash us pure as snow 
 Welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Nothing but Your blood, nothing but Your blood 
 King Jesus 
 It's your blood, it's your blood, Jesus 
 It's your blood, it's your blood, Jesus 
 Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood 
 Of Jesus 
 What can wash away our sins? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus 
 What can wash us pure as snow 
 Welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Nothing but Your blood, nothing but Your blood 
 King Jesus 
 It's your blood, it's your blood, Jesus 
 It's your blood, it's your blood, Jesus 
 Nothing but your blood, nothing but your blood 
 King Jesus

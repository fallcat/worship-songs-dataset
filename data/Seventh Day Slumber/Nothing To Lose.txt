It's such a lie 
 But the words keep ringing in my ears tonight 
 Though all I want is to be someone else 
 Undone 
 Lost in these thoughts and feeling all alone 
 This has to be the last time I feel this way 
 So hollow 
 Unwanted 
 Please save me from the dark 
 I'll sever whatever 
 Separates me from your arms 
 Waiting one more day is one day too late 
 God I'm holding onto you 
 I've got nothing to lose 
 It's such a lie 
 But I've heard it so much it feels like I can't deny 
 I'm worthless, I'm sick, I'm never gonna be enough for you 
 I'm done 
 But I won't let it end like all of the times before 
 This has to be the last time I feel this way 
 So hollow 
 Unwanted 
 Please save me from the dark 
 I'll sever whatever 
 Separates me from your arms 
 Waiting one more day is one day too late 
 God I'm holding onto you 
 I've got nothing to lose 
 This time I'm drowning inside 
 The waves of your love heal me 
 You heal me 
 No, they can't break me 
 This pain won't end me 
 So hollow 
 Unwanted 
 Please save me from the dark 
 I'll sever whatever 
 Separates me from your arms 
 Waiting one more day is one day too late 
 God I'm holding onto you 
 I've got nothing to lose

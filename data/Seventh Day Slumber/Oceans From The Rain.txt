And I'm amazed by You. Cause You're never far away 
 And all that I've been through, Your love has never changed 
 You make oceans from the rain 
 Breathing life into this place 
 And I will drown inside your love 
 Until I see your perfect face 
 And nothing I've acquired means anything at all 
 'Cause you're everything I needed 
 You're so much more than I deserve 
 And I thank you Lord (repeat 4 times) 
 The blood of Jesus can wash your pain away

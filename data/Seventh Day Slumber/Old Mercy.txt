This is what you're preachin' 
 What you're teachin' them 
 I don't want any part of it 
 I see something wrong 
 With holding rocks in your hands 
 So many splinters in your eyes 
 You can't even see the man that 
 You blame your pain within 
 It's unbelievable to me how you 
 Can see all that's wrong with another 
 And still be blind 
 The sin you make excuses for 
 Do this and don't do that 'cause it's wrong 
 But you've been sittin' here gossiping all day long 
 And that's okay 
 Why? 
 Why's it gotta be this way? 
 Why? 
 Why must we play these games? 
 Let the freedom bell ring 
 Whatever happened to old mercy? 
 I heard it read from a book that's been around a few years 
 If you ain't got no sin, go ahead, start through stones 
 But I'm anxious to see how many people just like me 
 Would have to put your big rocks down 
 Put 'em down, down

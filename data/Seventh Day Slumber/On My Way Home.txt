Missing you like crazy 
 I feel a million miles away 
 A part of me is empty 
 That no one could replace 
 So I'll run to you 
 Despite the shame 
 I'll leave it all behind 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you 
 How could you ever love me 
 When I didn't love myself 
 When my broken (ness?) consumed me 
 Everyone just walked away 
 You took me by the hand 
 I'm nothing without you 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you 
 And all those years 
 Without you here 
 ?? With so much pain 
 And on my own 
 I tried to change 
 I'm simply lost without you 
 I'm tearing down the walls 
 The walls that kept me in for so long 
 I'm tearing down the walls 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you 
 On my way home 
 On my way home 
 I'm running back to you

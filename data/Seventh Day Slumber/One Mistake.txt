Can I hear Your voice? 'Cause I feel so far away 
 And You've always known exactly what to say 
 But tonight I've really crossed the line 
 I've let You down but You never said goodbye 
 I know You'll be here tomorrow 
 When everyone else has come and gone 
 I want to run, I want to hide, wish I could disappear tonight 
 'Cause I feel like I'm just one mistake away 
 And I know You'll never leave but it's so hard to believe 
 When I feel like I'm just one mistake away from You leaving me today 
 How I've tried to keep this fire alive 
 Holding onto You, the one that I desire 
 And I know that I'm the one to blame 
 Wish I was stronger but I'm growing every day 
 And I know You'll be here tomorrow 
 When everyone else has come and gone 
 And I want to run, I want to hide, wish I could disappear tonight 
 'Cause I feel like I'm just one mistake away 
 And I know You'll never leave but it's so hard to believe 
 When I feel like I'm just one mistake away from You leaving me today 
 When I fall You run to hold me You wrap Your arms around me 
 And You calm all my fears, You're not leaving me here 
 I'm not too far away, still covered by Your grace 
 And You came to take away my shame, I'm not one mistake away 
 But I run and I hide, I'm still fighting with this life 
 That tells me I'm just one mistake away 
 And Jesus, I know You'll never leave, sometimes I get so sick of me 
 That I feel like I'm just one mistake away from You leaving me today

Water You turned into wine 
 Opened the eyes of the blind 
 There's no one like You 
 There's none like You 
 Into the darkness, You shine 
 Out of the ashes, we rise 
 There's no one like You 
 There's none like You 
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
 God, You are higher than any other 
 Our God is healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, our God 
 Into the darkness, You shine 
 Out of the ashes, we rise 
 There's no one like You 
 There's none like You 
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
 God, You are higher than any other 
 Our God is healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, our God 
 And if our God is for us then who could ever stop us, 
 And if our God is with us then what could stand against? 
 And if our God is for us then who could ever stop us, 
 And if our God is with us then what could stand against? 
 What could stand against? 
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
 God, You are higher than any other 
 Our God is healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, our God 
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
 God, You are higher than any other 
 Our God is healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, our God 
 And if our God is for us then who could ever stop us, 
 And if our God is with us then what could stand against? 
 And if our God is for us then who could ever stop us, 
 And if our God is with us then what could stand against? 
 Then what could stand against?

I hear them chanting again 
 I hear them crying out loud 
 I see the masses fall away 
 This bitter war has begun 
 I hear the children cry for food 
 Their fathers have left them all for dead 
 And we're running out of time 
 We're running out of time 
 Getting closer to the edge 
 We're running out of time 
 There's a fountain filled with blood 
 Poured from the virus of unborn children 
 The masacre is endless 
 And we watch them fade away 
 I hear the screaming save the trees 
 But we'd kill a generation to suit our own needs 
 What are we ending up to be 
 A nation in bondage that thinks we are free

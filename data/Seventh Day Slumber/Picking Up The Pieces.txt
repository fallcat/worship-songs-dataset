Open my eyes, my life is scattered on the floor 
 I walked away from you so long that I could not hear your voice. 
 Oh my tears that I cried I left them laying on your heart 
 And now I'm here with you again, can we pick up from the start. 
 All I have and all I need is everything You gave to me 
 I bitter way so now I'm picking up the pieces once again. 
 I'm falling to my knees that is where I saw Your hand 
 I've been here way too many times, 
 I can't believe You'd take me back 
 And all the tears that I've cried, 
 Never touched the ground and 
 Now I'm here with what is left 
 Will You build me up again?

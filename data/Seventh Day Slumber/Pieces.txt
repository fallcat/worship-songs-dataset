Here I am in this place again 
 The same old broken record spinning 
 It's playing endlessly 
 There I go once again 
 Chasing after all the empty things 
 And shattered dreams that never comfort me 
 And it always leads me here 
 What more can I say 
 The Lord, I'm broken 
 I'm nothing more than broken 
 And I can't wait another night 
 Lord, I'm lying here in pieces 
 Would You put me back together 
 Make me whole? 
 And everybody thinks I'm fine 
 But You see me here in pieces 
 Would You put me back together? 
 I can't hold myself together anymore 
 I'm so weak I can hardly stand 
 Feels like I am barely breathing 
 Still I'm holding unto You 
 And how could I drift away again? 
 I can't believe how fast I've fallen 
 I say this every single time 
 And it always leads me here 
 What more can I say 
 The Lord I'm broken 
 I'm nothing more than broken 
 I can't wait another night 
 While I'm lying here in pieces 
 Would You put me back together? 
 Make me whole? 
 Everybody thinks I'm fine 
 But You see me here in pieces 
 Would You put me back together? 
 I can't hold myself together anymore 
 I feel like everything's falling apart, rescue me 
 I've drifted off so far, it's not where I want to be 
 And all these years You've never let me go 
 Gather up the pieces, make me whole 
 I can't wait another night 
 While I'm lying here in pieces 
 Would You put me back together? 
 Make me whole 
 Everybody thinks I'm fine 
 But You see me here in pieces 
 Would You put me back together? 
 I can't hold myself together anymore 
 Would you put me back together? 
 I can't hold myself together anymore

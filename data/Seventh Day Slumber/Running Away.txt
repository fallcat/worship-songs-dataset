Followed my feet nowhere again, 
 Wherever I go there I am 
 I'm stuck on this road, 
 Life just keeps passing me by 
 What can I do to get from beyond 
 These walls that are laughing at me? 
 Sentenced to life and the prison is in my mind. 
 Losing my mind and I'm close to the edge, 
 You can't stop me from running away. 
 Losing my mind and I'm close to the edge, 
 Someone stop me from running away. 
 Followed my feet nowhere again, 
 Think that I'm going insane. 
 Searching for peace 
 But the outcome is always the same. 
 I want to believe 
 That I'm here for something 
 More than just taking up space. 
 Running away 'cause I just can't deal with this pain... 
 Here I am... 
 Repeat chorus 2x's 
 (Losing my mind) Someone stop me from running away... 
 (Losing my mind) Someone stop me from running away...

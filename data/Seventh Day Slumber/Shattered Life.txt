This wanting more from me is tearing me, it's breaking me 
 But what you want's not mine to give 
 I'm your dollar sign, your brand new house, 
 Your product line 
 When you're done with me I'm spent. 
 When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become... 
 Will you rescue me? Could you get me out alive? 
 I'm trying to hold on but I've lost the will to fight 
 Will You rescue me? Take me far away from this shattered life. 
 How can I go on pretending that there's nothing wrong? 
 Life has brought me to my knees 
 This mask I hide behind is killing me, 
 There's nothing left 
 Is there anyone who feels like me? 
 When the smoke is gone I have to face what I've become...

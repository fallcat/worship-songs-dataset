Skies are crying, I am watching 
 Catching tear drops in my hands 
 Only silence as it's ending 
 Like we never had a chance 
 Do you have to make me feel like 
 There's nothing left of me? 
 You can take everything I have 
 You can break everything I am 
 Like I'm made of glass 
 Like I'm made of paper 
 Oh Oh 
 Go on and try to tear me down 
 I will be rising from the ground 
 Like a skyscraper 
 Like a skyscraper 
 As the smoke clears, I awaken 
 And untangle you from me 
 Would it make you feel better 
 To watch me while I bleed? 
 All my windows still are broken 
 But I'm standing on my feet 
 You can take everything I have 
 You can break everything I am 
 Like I'm made of glass 
 Like I'm made of paper 
 Oh Oh 
 Go on and try to tear me down 
 I will be rising from the ground 
 Like a skyscraper 
 Like a skyscraper 
 Go run and run 
 I'm gonna stay right here, 
 Watch you disappear 
 Oh 
 Go run and run 
 'Cause it's a long way down 
 I'm closer to the clouds up here 
 You can take everything I have 
 You can break everything I am 
 Like I'm made of glass 
 Like I'm made of paper 
 Oh Oh 
 Go on and try to tear me down 
 I will be rising from the ground 
 Like a skyscraper 
 Like a skyscraper 
 Like a skyscraper

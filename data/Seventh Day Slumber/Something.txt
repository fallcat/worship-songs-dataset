Well, I've seen the winds of change now 
 Why'd they have to change today? 
 My eyes are drowning in this sea of pain 
 The world is closing in on me 
 My soul is sinking in my insides 
 My soul is sinking inside me 
 My eyes are cold, black and empty 
 Can anybody set me free? 
 Oh, I need something 
 I need something more 
 Well, I need You 
 Oh I need something 
 I something Lord 
 Well, I need You 
 Deception is the only friend I have 
 His bitter lies are killing me 
 My eyes are blurring as I fight to stay alive 
 Bound and broken on my knees 
 When will it end? 
 Let the healing begin 
 When will it end? 
 Let the healing begin 
 When will it end? 
 I'm suffering (x2)

There's love that came for us 
 Humbled to a sinner's cross 
 You broke my shame and sinfulness 
 You rose again victorious 
 You are stronger, You are stronger 
 Sin is broken, You have saved us 
 It is written, Christ has risen 
 Jesus You are Lord of all 
 Faithfulness none can deny 
 Through the storm and through the fire 
 There's truth that sets me free 
 Jesus Christ who lives in me 
 You are stronger, You are stronger 
 Sin is broken, You have saved us 
 It is written, Christ has risen 
 Jesus You are Lord of all 
 So let Your name be lifted higher 
 Be lifted higher 
 Be lifted higher 
 (x4) 
 You are stronger, You are stronger 
 Sin is broken, You have saved us 
 It is written, Christ has risen 
 Jesus You are Lord of all 
 (x2)

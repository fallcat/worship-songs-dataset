Another melody 
 Another empty song 
 I tell myself that I have praised you 
 And try and make believe 
 This is all you want 
 But once again I know I've missed it 
 Praising you is not just the songs I sing 
 Jesus here I am 
 Take everything 
 Take the pain inside 
 Take the brokenness 
 Don't stop till there's nothing left 
 My arrogance, my pride 
 The loss of innocence 
 Jesus, take everything 
 Another melody

 I tell myself that I have praised you 
 And try and make believe 
 This is all you want 
 But once again I know I've missed it 
 Praising you is not just the songs I sing

 Take everything 
 Take the pain inside 
 Take the brokenness 
 Don't stop till there's nothing left 
 My arrogance, my pride 
 The loss of innocence 
 Jesus, take everything 
 There's nothing left I need 
 That's when I feel alive 
 Holy Spirit fall 
 Fresh upon me 
 You can have it all 
 Take the pain inside 
 Take the brokenness 
 Don't stop till there's nothing left 
 My arrogance, my pride 
 The loss of innocence 
 Jesus, take everything 
 Take the pain inside 
 Take the brokenness 
 Don't stop till there's nothing left 
 My arrogance, my pride 
 The loss of innocence 
 Jesus, take everything

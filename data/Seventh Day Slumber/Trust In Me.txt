You been waiting on the rain to clear so you can dance 
 Just a break from all the chaos so you can catch your breath 
 You don't need to see the ending of your storm to know it's there 
 Or see the footprints in the sand to know that I am here 
 There's freedom that you've never known 
 A peace that comes from letting go 
 Trust in me 
 Trust in me 
 A love so deep it knows no end 
 A refuge from the storm within 
 Trust in me 
 Trust in me 
 Don't always trust your eyes they can only see so far 
 Like poor reflections of the truth it's not really where you are 
 And you can walk on water if you keep your eyes on me 
 And the waves won't take you over if you would just beleve 
 There's freedom that you've never known 
 A peace that comes from letting go 
 Trust in me 
 Trust in me 
 A love so deep it knows no end 
 A refuge from the storm within 
 Trust in me 
 Trust in me 
 I remember every tear you've cried 
 You were never alone 
 I am by your side 
 All the pain and hurt that you've been through 
 In every moment I am here with you 
 With you 
 There's freedom that you've never known 
 A peace that comes from letting go 
 Trust in me 
 Trust in me 
 A love so deep it knows no end 
 A refuge from the storm within 
 Trust in me 
 Trust in me 
 Trust in me

I'm trying to remember 
 When Your presence fell like rain 
 These hollow things have replaced You 
 Lord, I need You back again 
 Take me to where I should be 
 'Cause I don't belong here, I know 
 Without You, there's no hope for me 
 I'm undone, make me whole 
 There are still burning embers 
 Of a life that You restored 
 Jesus, You embraced me 
 When the world had closed the door 
 I'm trying to remember 
 When Your presence fell like rain

Back in the saddle again, I feel alive 
 I was slowly fading 
 And all that I wanted to be but I never been 
 Was slowly dissipating 
 And I believe in miracles 
 You know I've seen them time and time again 
 Now this one's mine 
 A wasted life was the road that I was on 
 I was running blind into the unknown 
 Just in the nick of time You found me at my worst 
 And brought me home 
 The battle starts in your mind then straight to the soul 
 It can leave you breathless 
 If only you can leave it behind but it won't let you go 
 It seems the pages won't end 
 And I believe in miracles 
 You know I've seen them time and time again 
 Now this one's mine 
 A wasted life was the road that I was on 
 I was running blind into the unknown 
 Just in the nick of time You found me at my worst 
 And brought me home 
 When there was no way out 
 You found me in the darkest place 
 Just as I start to fade 
 I hear Your voice, it's calling me 
 Saying, "You are not alone 
 I'm here to break these chains and take you home" 
 A wasted life was the road that I was on 
 And I was running blind into the unknown 
 Just in the nick of time You found me at my worst 
 And brought me home 
 A wasted life was the road that I was on 
 And I was running blind into the unknown 
 Just in the nick of time You found me at my worst 
 And brought me home

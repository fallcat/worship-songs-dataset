They keep you hanging on 
 Always hiding the truth 
 Afraid of what you find 
 Inside you 
 All the pain they put you through 
 To deny the shame and wrong they do 
 There's a light inside the darkness can't defeat 
 Or destroy 
 It's time to find out who we are 
 We are the broken 
 All that remains of our past are the scars 
 Our eyes are open 
 We're not afraid to admit who we are 
 We are the broken 
 It's their 
 All the lies and abuse 
 The pain you try to hide 
 Is bleeding through 
 The perfect ways and your mistakes 
 Are the plastic smiles of a thousand fakes 
 You're more than what they said that you could be 
 So believe 
 We are the broken 
 All that remains of our past are the scars 
 Our eyes are open 
 We're not afraid to admit who we are 
 We are the broken 
 Oooohooo oh oh 
 Our eyes (our eyes) are open (open) 
 Our eyes (our eyes) are open (open) 
 Our eyes are open 
 Our eyes are open 
 It's time to find out who we are 
 We are the broken 
 All that remains of our past are the scars 
 Our eyes are open 
 We're not afraid to admit who we are 
 We are the broken 
 Now we can see we were loved from the start 
 We are the chosen 
 We are the beautiful light in the dark

Well I can ask the gene to pull me through 
 Well I can ask the mad man for his point of view 
 And I can call a psychic for a well rehersed guess 
 I can call on budah for a walk in the dark 
 I can call on bobby we got high from time to time 
 Call a politician to tell me wrong from right 
 I can ask my bestfriend to tuck me in my bed 
 Or I can call a suicide line with a gun to my head 
 What I need is some good advice 
 To help me win this losing games 
 I can see my life before my eyes 
 Oh and I can't stand the pain 
 The gene couldn't help me she was full of smoke 
 The mad man gave me a padded cell 
 The Psychic didn't know me it was just a joke 
 And Budah walked me to the gates of hell 
 Bobby died with a needle in his arm 
 The politician is doing time 
 My bestfriend he found the answer Jesus Christ 
 And I'm still hanging on the suicide line 
 What I need is some good advice 
 To help me win this losing games 
 I can see my life before my eyes 
 Oh and I can't stand the pain 
 What I need is some good advice 
 To help me win this losing games 
 I can see my life before my eyes 
 Oh and I can't stand the pain

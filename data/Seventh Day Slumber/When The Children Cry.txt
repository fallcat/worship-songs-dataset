Little child 
 Dry your crying eyes 
 How can I explain 
 The fear you feel inside 
 Cause you were born 
 Into this evil world 
 Where man is killing man 
 And no one knows just why 
 What have we become 
 Just look what we have done 
 All that we've destroyed 
 You must build again 
 When the children cry 
 Let 'em know we tried 
 'Cause when the children sing 
 Then the new world begins 
 Little child 
 You must show the way 
 To a better day 
 For all the young 
 Cause you were born 
 For the all the world to see 
 That we all can live 
 With love and peace 
 No more presidents 
 And all the wars will end 
 One united world under God 
 When the children cry 
 Let 'em know we tried 
 'Cause when the children sing 
 Then the new world begins 
 What have we become 
 Just look what we have done 
 All that we've destroyed 
 You must build again 
 No more presidents 
 And all the wars will end 
 One united world under God 
 When the children cry 
 Let 'em know we tried 
 And when the children fight 
 Let 'em know it ain't right 
 When the children pray 
 Let 'em know the way 
 'Cause when the children sing 
 The new world begins

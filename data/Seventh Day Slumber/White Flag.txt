The battle rages on 
 As storm and tempest roar 
 We cannot win this fight 
 Inside our rebel hearts 
 We're laying down our weapons now 
 We raise our white flag 
 We surrender 
 All to You 
 All for You 
 We raise our white flag 
 The war is over 
 Love has come 
 Love has won 
 Here on this holy ground 
 You made a way for peace 
 Laying Your body down 
 You took our rightful place 
 This freedom song is marching on 
 We raise our white flag 
 We surrender 
 All to You 
 All for You 
 We raise our white flag 
 The war is over 
 Love has come 
 Love has won 
 We lift the cross 
 Lift it high, lift it high 
 (x4) 
 We raise our white flag 
 We surrender 
 All to You 
 All for You 
 We raise our white flag 
 The war is over 
 Love has come 
 Love has won 
 We raise our white flag 
 We surrender 
 All to You 
 All for You 
 We raise our white flag 
 The war is over 
 Love has come 
 Love has won 
 We lift the cross 
 Lift it high, lift it high 
 (x4) 
 We raise our white flag 
 We surrender 
 All to You 
 All to You

Your innocence forsaken 
 Upon that cross 
 You gave Yourself for us 
 Carried into Your freedom 
 Our broken past replaced in 
 A second chance 
 The chains have come undone 
 Death defied in the Father's love 
 We are living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 Living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 You gave what the world couldn't offer us 
 Say what they want 
 Say what they want 
 We are free 
 Woah-oah-oah 
 The atmosphere is changing 
 Oh can You hear 
 The people rising up 
 In the hope of Your freedom 
 Our former ways are breaking 
 We seek Your face 
 God let Your kingdom come 
 In our praises be lifted up 
 We are living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 Living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 You gave what the world couldn't offer us 
 Say what they want 
 Say what they want 
 We are free 
 Woah-oah-oah 
 We are free 
 Woah-oah-oah 
 With eyes on high we praise You 
 And with one voice we come together 
 Our one desire to praise You 
 And lift You up in our surrender 
 With eyes on high we praise You 
 And with one voice we come together 
 Our one desire to praise You 
 And lift You up 
 We are living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 Living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 You gave what the world couldn't offer us 
 Say what they want 
 Say what they want 
 We are living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 Living to make Your Name high Jesus 
 You gave what the world couldn't offer us 
 Say what they want 
 Say what they want 
 We are free 
 Woah-oah-oah 
 We are free 
 Woah-oah-oah 
 Woah-oah-oah 
 Woah-oah-oah

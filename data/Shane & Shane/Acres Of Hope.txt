He will allure her 
 He will pursue her 
 Call her out 
 To wilderness with flowers in his hands 
 She is responding 
 Beat up and hurting 
 Deserving death 
 Offerings of life are found instead 
 She will sing, she will sing 
 Oh, to you 
 She will sing in the days of you 
 As you lead her away to valleys, Lord 
 Oh, Acres of hope 
 Acres of hope 
 Here in the valley 
 Walk close beside me 
 Don't look back 
 For love is growing 
 Vineyards up ahead 
 You have called me master 
 Though you are in the dark here 
 Call me friend 
 And call me lover, very near for good 
 She will sing, she will sing 
 Oh, to you 
 She will sing in the days of youth 
 As you lead her away to valleys, Lord 
 Acres of hope 
 Acres of hope 
 How the story ends is 
 Love and tenderness in him 
 Not safe, but worth it, so worth it 
 So valleys up ahead 
 With the ones we live 
 We will sing together 
 Oh, we'll sing 
 We'll sing together 
 Oh, Lord we'll sing 
 We'll sing together 
 Oh, Lord we'll sing 
 We'll sing together 
 Lord, we'll sing 
 We will sing, we will sing 
 Oh, to you 
 We will sing, we will sing 
 In the days to you 
 As you lead us away to valleys, Lord 
 To acres of hope 
 Acres of hope

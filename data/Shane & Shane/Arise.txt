Arise and awaken 
 He is King, He is King 
 Arise, my soul awaken 
 All flesh is grass, surely is fading 
 Oh, soon it's all gone and we'll fly away 
 Oh, soon it's gone, it's gone 
 Oh, You are the Maker, the life sustainer 
 Everything comes, everything goes 
 When You give the word have mercy, oh Lord 
 And satisfy, we will [Incomprehensible] 
 Arise, my soul awaken 
 That I might sing and be happy all my days 
 How long will there be mourning 
 Return to us, return to us 
 Oh, soon it's all gone, we'll fly away 
 Oh, soon it's gone, it's gone 
 Oh, You are the Maker, the life sustainer 
 Everything comes, everything goes 
 When You give the word have mercy, oh Lord 
 And satisfy, we will [Incomprehensible] 
 Teach me to number my days at the most 80 years 
 Who cares about meaningless things 
 I do, and I care about art too and I care about yahoo 
 Things that are fleeting, fading away 
 Awaken my soul 
 Awaken my soul 
 You are the Maker, the life sustainer 
 Everything comes, everything goes 
 When You give the word have mercy, oh Lord 
 You are the Maker, the life sustainer 
 And everything comes, everything goes 
 When You give the word have mercy, oh Lord 
 And satisfy, we will [Incomprehensible] arise

You have made my day 
 Even in stormy weather 
 I'm dancing in all the rain 
 Cause you make bad days 
 Great is the way 
 When you come to mind 
 I am smiling ear to ear 
 Sweet thoughts of you 
 I'm always in the mood 
 To twirl around with you 
 While it's raining 
 Even if it's a dream 
 Great is the way 
 That I am unafraid 
 When I see you 
 All my fear goes away 
 Bad days are coming 
 Rainy days are always around 
 But if I can see you 
 One glance upon you 
 The sun comes out 
 I'm dancing in all the rain 
 Cause you make bad days better

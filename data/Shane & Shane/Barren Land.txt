Barren land can overflow 
 With life and fruit and fields that grow 
 Even in the labor and toil 
 Planting seed and tilling soil 
 Will stay the same, stay the same 
 But if for the rain!  But if for rain! 
 But if for rain to fall irresistibly call 
 Rain to cover me 
 But if for rain to heal, uncontrollably fill 
 The soil of eternity 
 And barren land will overflow 
 With life and fruit and fields that grow 
 Holy Spirit spur me to till 
 A once barren land so thirsty still 
 For living water, O God, sustain 
 So life and fruit and fields remain 
 Lest they stay the same, stay the same 
 But if for the rain!  But if for rain! 
 But if for rain to fall irresistibly call 
 Rain to cover me 
 But if for rain to heal, uncontrollably fill 
 The soil of eternity 
 But if for the rain!  But if for rain! 
 But if for rain!

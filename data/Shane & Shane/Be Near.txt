You are all 
 Big and small 
 Beautiful 
 And wonderful 
 To trust in grace through faith 
 But I'm asking to taste... 
 For dark is light to You 
 Depths are height to You 
 Far is near 
 But, Lord, I need to hear from You 
 Be near, O God 
 Be near, O God, of us 
 Your nearness 
 Is to us our good 
 Be near, O God 
 Be near, O God, of us 
 Your nearness 
 Is to us our good, our good 
 Your fullness is mine 
 Revelation divine 
 But, o, to taste 
 To know much more than a page 
 To feel Your embrace... 
 For dark is light to You 
 The depths are height to You 
 Far is near 
 But, Lord, I need to hear from You 
 Be near, O God 
 Be near, O God, of us 
 Your nearness 
 Is to us our good 
 Be near, O God 
 Be near, O God, of us 
 Your nearness 
 Is to us our good, our good 
 Be near, O God 
 Be near, O God, of us 
 Your nearness 
 Is to us our good 
 Be near, O God 
 Be near, O God, of us 
 Your nearness 
 Is to us our good, our good 
 My God

Beauty for ashes 
 A garment of praise for my heaviness 
 Beauty for ashes 
 Take this heart of stone and make it Yours 
 I delight myself in the Riches of Fare 
 Trading all that I've had for all that is better 
 A garment of praise for my heaviness 
 You are the greatest taste, 
 You're the Richest of Fare 
 Beauty for ashes 
 A garment of praise for my heaviness 
 Beauty for ashes 
 Take this heart of stone and make it Yours 
 I delight myself in the Riches of Fare 
 Trading all that I've had for all that is better 
 A garment of praise for my heaviness 
 You are the greatest taste, 
 I delight myself in the Riches of Fare 
 Trading all that I've had for all that is better 
 A garment of praise for my heaviness 
 You are the greatest taste, 
 You're the Richest of Fare 
 You are better, so much better 
 Oh, Lord 
 You are better, You taste better 
 So much better 
 Beauty for ashes 
 A garment of praise for my heaviness 
 Beauty for ashes 
 Take this heart of stone and make it Yours

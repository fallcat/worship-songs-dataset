What if God came down to earth 
 Stepped out of heaven 
 Walked into your house 
 Said ask me anything 
 And you said I just had to know 
 How do ya get to heaven 
 And you were hanging on His every word 
 'Cause He is God, You believe because He's God 
 And He said 
 There's a way to go, an open door 
 For the human soul 
 You can come today 
 Jesus is the way 
 He's my only Son, He's the one I love 
 And I gave Him up for you to be saved 
 Jesus is the way 
 You know that God came down to earth 
 He stepped out of heaven 
 Walked into my world 
 And made my heart His home 
 And He said there is a better way 
 A life worth living 
 And I'm hanging on His every word 
 'Cause He is God, I believe because He's God 
 And He said 
 There's a way to go, an open door 
 For the human soul 
 You can come today 
 Jesus is the way 
 He's my only Son, He's the one I love 
 And I gave Him up for you to be saved 
 Jesus is the way 
 Oh 
 There's a fork in the road ahead 
 That you are walking 
 It is wide and it is easier 
 But it leads to destruction 
 The other way is a narrow gate 
 It's the path less taken 
 It is hard and it requires your life 
 It's the pathway to Zion 
 The pathway to Zion 
 There's a way to go, an open door 
 For the human soul 
 You can come today 
 Jesus is the way 
 There's a way to go, an open door 
 For the human soul 
 You can come today 
 Jesus is the way 
 He's my only son, He's the one I love 
 And I gave Him up for you to be saved 
 Jesus is the way 
 There's a way to go, an open door 
 For the human soul 
 You can come today 
 Jesus is the way 
 He's my only son, He's the one I love 
 And I gave Him up for you to be saved 
 Jesus is the way

Before the throne of God above 
 I have a strong, a perfect plea: 
 A great High Priest, whose name is Love, 
 Who ever lives and pleads for me. 
 My name is graven on his hands, 
 My name is written on his heart; 
 I know that while in heaven he stands 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart. 
 When Satan tempts me to despair, 
 And tells me of the guilt within, 
 Upward I look, and see him there 
 Who made an end of all my sin. 
 Because a sinless Savior died, 
 My sinful soul is counted free; 
 For God, the Just, is satisfied 
 To look on Him and pardon me 
 To look on Him and pardon me 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the One, 
 Risen Son of God! 
 Behold him there, the risen Lamb 
 My perfect, spotless righteousness, 
 The great unchangeable I am, 
 The King of glory and of grace! 
 One in himself, I cannot die 
 My soul is purchased by his blood 
 My life is hid with Christ on high, 
 With Christ, my Savior and my God 
 With Christ, my Savior and my God

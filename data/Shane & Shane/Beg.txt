Here I am 
 One more day of not 
 Loving Him the way He asks 
 In fact my heart is singing praises to the things 
 That make me feel alright 
 So I'm sinking fast like a stone heart should 
 And on the way down 
 I've done what I could 
 To try and try to turn this stone to flesh 
 I'm haunted by my God 
 Who has the right to ask me 
 What by the nature of my rebellion 
 I cannot give. 
 So I beg for you to move 
 I beg for you to move 
 I beg for you to break through 
 So here I am 
 Got my deeds for the day 
 All my cute little words about 
 How I am saved 
 Am I saved? 
 Could I love you with my mouth like a church kid should 
 At the end of the day 
 My words get burned as wood 
 Oh, but I was good. 
 I'm haunted by my God 
 Who has the right to ask me 
 What by the nature of my rebellion 
 I cannot give. 
 These songs are noise 
 In your ears 
 A clanging drum 
 You want my love

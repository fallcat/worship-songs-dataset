One, two, three 
 When the babe was born 
 In a manger on the hay 
 God saw a veil torn 
 He saw Good Friday 
 He was born to die 
 Gold laid before the Christ 
 Incense, His presence is sweet 
 Myrrh to signify 
 Victory over death's sting 
 He was born to die 
 It came in a dream 
 To Joseph late one night 
 That Herod sought the King 
 But could not take His life 
 He was born to die 
 He said, "You don't take my life 
 You won't take my life 
 You don't take my life 
 I lay it down" 
 We came here today 
 To celebrate His birth 
 But let us not forget 
 Why Jesus came to earth 
 He was born to die 
 He was born to die 
 He was born to 
 He was born to die

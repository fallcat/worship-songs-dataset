A life you cannot define 
 A purpose that's benign 
 They need to see and believe 
 Be led to the rugged tree 
 The one on which he cried not for his pain but for our debt 
 The very same tree that He conquered death 
 It was an unfair deal on the part of Christ 
 He got my sin, I got eternal life 
 Make me the breath of God 
 And I'll show them the One that means the most to me 
 They'll see the face of love 
 Be touched by the very one who died upon the tree 
 Small talk is a better choice 
 A way to avoid Your voice 
 I need to feel the dust on my knees 
 And lead them to the tree 
 Will you follow Me, lead them to the tree 
 Can't you just believe, will you take a knee for eternity

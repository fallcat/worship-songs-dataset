There were three 
 Before the king 
 There were three who wouldn't bow to him 
 For when you heard 
 The music play 
 And you were standing you would burn. 
 They looked at him and said 
 Burn us up! Burn us up! Burn us up! 
 Oh king won't you burn us in the furnace of 
 Your desire 
 We give up! We give up! We give up! 
 Oh king won't you burn us in the furnace of 
 Your desire! 
 Won't you throw us in the fire! 
 The king enraged 
 At what they said 
 Sent the three away to find their death 
 The palace stopped in unbelief 
 When the guilty raised their hands to sing 
 They looked at him and said 
 You are able to deliver from the fire of affliction 
 It's the declaration of my Lord 
 You're not an image of gold 
 You're the God of old 
 You have made us 
 Come and save us 
 We are Yours 
 But even if You don't, we will burn!

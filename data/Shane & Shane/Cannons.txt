You are holy great and mighty 
 The moon and the stars declare who You are 
 I'm so unworthy, but still You love me 
 Forever my heart will sing of how great You are 
 It's falling from the clouds 
 A strange and lovely sound 
 I hear it in the thunder and the rain 
 It's ringing in the skies 
 Like cannons in the night 
 The music of the universe plays 
 Singing You are holy great and mighty 
 The moon and the stars declare who You are 
 I'm so unworthy, but still You love me 
 Forever my heart will sing of how great You are 
 Beautiful and free 
 The song of galaxies 
 Reaching far beyond the milky way 
 Lets join in with the sound 
 C'mon let's sing it loud 
 As the music of the universe plays 
 Singing You are holy great and mighty 
 The moon and the stars declare who You are 
 I'm so unworthy, but still You love me 
 Forever my heart will sing of You 
 All glory, honor, power is Yours amen 
 All glory, honor, power is Yours amen 
 All glory, honor, power is Yours forever amen 
 You are holy great and mighty 
 The moon and the stars declare who You are 
 I'm so unworthy, but still You love me 
 Forever my heart will sing of how great You are 
 You are holy great and mighty 
 The moon and the stars declare who You are 
 I'm so unworthy, but still You love me 
 Forever my heart will sing of how great You are

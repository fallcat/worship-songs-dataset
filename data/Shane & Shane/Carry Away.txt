At what point did I, did I know that I would be around? 
 At what point did I, did I know that I would be found... 
 And dine with You? 
 Carry away my mind, carry me away 
 Carry away my mind 
 Carry away my time, sweep me away 
 Carry away my time 
 Who gave the right to interrupt my life with thoughts of You? 
 Needless to say, I bid my rights good day 
 I'm here to live and die with You, only You, Lord 
 Carry away my mind, carry me away 
 Carry away my mind 
 Carry away my time, sweep me away 
 Carry away my time 
 If You will lead on 
 Forsake not Your song in me 
 Jesus, song in in me 
 Carry away my mind, carry me away 
 Carry away my mind 
 Carry away my time, sweep me away 
 Carry away my time 
 Carry away my mind, carry me away 
 Carry away my mind 
 Carry away my time, sweep me away 
 Carry away my time 
 Carry away my mind, carry me away 
 Carry away my mind 
 Carry away my time, sweep me away 
 Carry away my time

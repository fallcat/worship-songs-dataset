John 1:18 
 Stir my affection 
 Stir my affection 
 Stir my affection for You 
 For You're my only hope 
 You Yeshua 
 Explained the way He moves 
 As just an ordinary man 
 Then again, You're the first, Jesus 
 And by Your hand we move 
 You're the image of the invisible God 
 You are God, You are God 
 Bring fascination 
 Bring fascination 
 Bring fascination of You 
 For You're my only hope

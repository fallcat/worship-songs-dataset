I love the Lord for He heard my voice 
 And answered my cry for mercy 
 Because He listened to me 
 I will call upon Him as long as I live 
 What shall I render to the Giver of life 
 And who all things are made 
 What shall I render to the one 
 Who paints the oceans blue, Jesus Christ 
 I will lift up the cup of salvation 
 Call on the name of the Lord 
 How do I repay the life that You gave 
 I call on the name of the Lord 
 Lift up the cup You have already poured 
 What kind of rendering is found in this taking 
 Found in this drinking of love? 
 Love so abundant, He leads me 
 And depravity one thing to give 
 What shall I render to the Giver of life 
 And who all things are made 
 What shall I render to the one 
 Who paints the oceans blue, Jesus Christ 
 I will lift up the cup of salvation 
 Call on the name of the Lord 
 How do I repay the life that You gave 
 I call on the name of the Lord 
 Lift up the cup You have already 
 You have delivered my soul from death 
 My eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling 
 And I will walk before the Lord 
 In the land of the living 
 I will lift up the cup of salvation 
 Call on the name of the Lord 
 How do I repay the life that You gave 
 I call on the name of the Lord 
 Lift up the cup You have poured 
 I will lift up the cup of salvation 
 Call on the name of the Lord 
 How do I repay the life that You gave 
 I call on the name of the Lord 
 And lift up the cup You have already poured 
 Already poured

The father of lies 
 Coming to steal 
 Kill and destroy 
 All my hopes of being good enough 
 I hear him saying cursed are the ones 
 Who can't abide 
 He's right 
 Alleluia he's right! 
 The devil is preaching 
 The song of the redeemed 
 That I am cursed and gone astray 
 I cannot gain salvation 
 Embracing accusation 
 Could the father of lies 
 Be telling the truth 
 Of God to me tonight? 
 If the penalty of sin is death 
 Then death is mine 
 I hear him saying cursed are the ones 
 Who can't abide 
 He's right 
 Alleluia he's right! 
 Oh the devil's singing over me 
 An age old song 
 That I am cursed and gone astray 
 Singing the first verse so conveniently 
 He's forgotten the refrain 
 Jesus saves!

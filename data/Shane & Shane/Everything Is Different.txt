Who am I to know Your glory? 
 Who am I to recognize your voice calling out? 
 How could I be in Your story? 
 God who was and is and is to come who is One? 
 I was dead in my sin 
 You came in 
 Yeah 
 You made a way when there was no way 
 You covered heaviness with garments of praise 
 You wrote a song and You're singing it over me 
 I feel a dead heart beating now 
 This revelation makes me wanta shout (HEY!) 
 That Jesus has been sent 
 And everything is different. 
 You turn ashes into beauty 
 You are for me, not against me now 
 You found me somehow 
 You turn mourning into dancing 
 You turn weeping into a joyful noise 
 Oh rejoice! 
 I was dead in my sin 
 You came in 
 Yeah 
 You made a way when there was no way 
 You covered heaviness with garments of praise 
 You wrote a song and You're singing it over me 
 I feel a dead heart beating now 
 This revelation makes me wanta shout (HEY!) 
 That Jesus has been sent 
 And everything is different. 
 What matter of love that You would call us sons and daughters? 
 We cry "Abba! Father!" 
 Alleluia Alleluia Alleluia 
 I will never be the same. 
 You made a way when there was no way 
 You covered heaviness with garments of praise 
 You wrote a song and You're singing it over me 
 I feel a dead heart beating now 
 This revelation makes me wanta shout (HEY!) 
 That Jesus has been sent 
 And everything is different. 
 You made a way when there was no way 
 You covered heaviness with garments of praise 
 You wrote a song and You're singing it over me 
 I feel a dead heart beating now 
 This revelation makes me wanta shout (HEY!) 
 That Jesus has been sent 
 And everything is different.

When darkness is surrounding me 
 By Your Spirit, Lord help me sing 
 That You are working all things out 
 Lord, I really need to hear you speak 
 Remind me in the waiting 
 That You are working all things out 
 For the good of those 
 Who are called by You 
 For the good of those 
 Who are in Love with You 
 That's why we sing 
 Holy God of light 
 I lay down my life 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Even in the storm be glorified 
 We like to take the blessing from You 
 Shall we not take the trouble too 
 You are working all things out 
 We like to take prosperity 
 Shall we not take the suffering 
 You are working all things out 
 Holy are you Lord 
 Even in the storm 
 Be glorified 
 Worthy of affection

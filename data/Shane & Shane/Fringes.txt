He stretches out the north over empty space 
 And hangs the earth on nothing 
 And how faint a word we even hear of Him 
 And yet - our eyes and ears and minds get all the candy 
 I sing for grace 
 For grace it lets me sing 
 And all I've ever seen or heard 
 Or haven't seen or heard 
 It's His 
 There is no other 
 All of this is but the fringes 
 And these are but the fringes 
 And all the world hinges 
 On His grace and on His word 
 It speaks things into being 
 And the spoken things revealing 
 The glory of our God and King 
 I'm stumbling upon things that aren't mine 
 Things he spoke to life before time 
 Name one thing that's not 
 One law or thought 
 He taught the clay 
 Molded it 
 Behold, He called the sheep 
 That's why they came 
 Sheep! Who by grace get a peep 
 And make it cheap by calling it mine 
 "Behold, these are the fringes of His ways; And how faint a word we hear of Him! But His mighty thunder, who can understand?" (Job 26:14)

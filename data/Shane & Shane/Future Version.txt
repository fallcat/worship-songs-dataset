Maybe a future version of me You'll love 
 I can't imagine being worthy of a love like this 
 I could be a better man, I swear to You 
 Come back and see me in a year or two 
 At the moment I'm trying to change into 
 A future version You can embrace 
 You I love 
 Regardless of the things you've said and done 
 No mistake can change my mind 
 Come, seek, and find 
 My love is yours right now 
 Right now I'm seeing You and I cannot deny 
 Amazing things but still I try and try and try 
 To gain a love like this 
 You know the things that I am seeing 
 They must be true 
 'Cause I have seen them in you too 
 And I can tell you now your sin remains 
 But I still love you with amazing grace 
 I am loved 
 Regardless of the things I've said and done 
 No mistake can change your mind 
 I'm your design 
 Your love is mine right now 
 Its less about the do's and don'ts 
 The won'ts us feel like My love is far away 
 Its more about the things I've done to overcome 
 My life, and death, and resurrection 
 My love is yours today 
 Nothing can separate my love anyway 
 I am loved 
 Regardless of the things I've said and done 
 No mistake can change your mind 
 I'm your design 
 Your love is mine 
 I am loved 
 Regardless of the things I've said and done 
 No mistake can change your mind 
 I'm your design, God 
 Your love is mine right now

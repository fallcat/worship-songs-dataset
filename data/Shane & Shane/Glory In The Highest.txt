Holy One 
 Light of the world, Jesus 
 The Holy One of Israel 
 The One foretold He came 
 Deliverer of Israel 
 The One foretold He came 
 Born of man 
 He became the lowest 
 To show us 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 The Chosen One of Israel 
 The One foretold He came 
 We all like sheep have gone astray 
 We turned to our own way 
 But still He came 
 Born of man 
 He became the lowest 
 To show us 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 Glory in the highest 
 (Holy One) 
 Glory in the highest 
 (Light of the world) 
 Glory in the highest 
 (Jesus)

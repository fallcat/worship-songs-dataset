Growin' up I overheard 
 All the grown ups sayin' 
 You better be prayin' 
 And sayin' 
 All the right little things 
 At the right little times 
 And I had it down 
 At least on the outside 
 I'd put my best side forward 
 I could smile with the best 
 And dress like the rest 
 Of the messed up church folk singin' a song 
 Are you sitting down 
 With all your sin and shame all stored up 
 Are you ready to live 
 For what the law could not do 
 God did 
 Could it be that morality 
 Got the best of you and me 
 Got us thinking 
 That we're on the brink 
 Of a drink of the cup that's all filled up 
 With the cross havin' even a little to do with us 
 It was His day 
 It was His way 
 To the glory of His grace 
 Took our disease 
 Enough to please 
 The Father of lights 
 To bruise Jesus 
 Maybe do's and don'ts 
 Were made to show 
 How much we do 
 And don't ever make it

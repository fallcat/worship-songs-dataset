What are you gonna do 
 When the doctor comes 
 Into the waiting room 
 Puts his hand on you 
 And says I'm sorry? 
 What are you gonna say to God 
 When all you do is pray to God 
 To take the thorn away? 
 And all you hear him say is 
 My grace is sufficient 
 What are you gonna do 
 When your neighbor walks 
 Into your living room 
 And you to tell him 
 Who could deliver them 
 Like He delivered you? 
 My grace is sufficient 
 What are you gonna say to God 
 When everything you prayed to God 
 Came your way but you forgot to thank Him? 
 And all you hear Him say is 
 My grace

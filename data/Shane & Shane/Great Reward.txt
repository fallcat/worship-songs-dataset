Jesus, You're my Great Reward 
 You are my portion, Lord 
 And while in heaven you plead for me 
 Draw my every thought to Thee 
 I love you, Lord 
 Jesus my King 
 I want to love You more 
 My Great Reward 
 I have this treasure in a jar of clay 
 All You glory on display 
 In a sinner who was saved by grace 
 You have made me a dwelling place 
 You are all I'm living for 
 I'm moving toward the place 
 One thing I ask 
 And this I seek 
 To gaze into Your eyes

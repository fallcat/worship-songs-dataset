When I think about the Lord 
 How He saved me, how he raised me 
 How He filled me with the Holy Ghost 
 How He healed me to the uttermost 
 When I think about the Lord 
 How He picked me up and turned me around 
 How He set my feet, on solid ground 
 It makes me wanna shout; 
 "Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, 
 Lord you're worthy of all the glory 
 And all the honor, and all the praise!"

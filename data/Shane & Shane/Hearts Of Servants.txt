 Jesus, You were 
 Jesus, You will always be 
 A perfect servant to us 
 A perfect servant to death 
 Even death on a cross 
 Give us a picture of Your face 
 Show us the measure of Your grace 
 Reveal the love of the Father 
 Put within us tenderness 
 Release from us all selfishness 
 We'll consider them better 
 We are Yours 
 Give us hearts of servants

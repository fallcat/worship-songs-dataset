You are my holiday 
 You are right in the middle of me 
 You are my hideaway 
 You, You are home 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 Oh, my holiday 
 You make my heart new 
 And I love You 
 What it is I'm trying to say 
 You are my favorite part of me 
 You are my holiday 
 You are right in the middle of me 
 You are my hideaway 
 You, You are home 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 Oh, my holiday 
 You make my heart new 
 And I love You 
 What it is I'm trying to say 
 You are my favorite part of me 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 Oh, my holiday 
 You make my heart new 
 And I love You 
 What it is I'm trying to say 
 You are my favorite part, oh 
 What it is I'm trying to say 
 You are my favorite part of me

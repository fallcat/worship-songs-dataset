Come let us return 
 He has torn us into pieces 
 He has injured us 
 Come let us return to the Lord 
 He will heal us 
 He will bandage our wounds 
 In just a short time He'll restore us 
 In just a short time He'll restore His church 
 So we might live 
 We might live in His presence 
 In His presence 
 Oh that we might know the Lord 
 Oh that we might know the Lord 
 Oh that we might know the Lord 
 Let us press on to know Him 
 Let us press hard into Him 
 Then as surely as the coming of the dawn 
 He will respond

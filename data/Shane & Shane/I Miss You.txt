Put down Your paper plate 
 Come to the table made 
 Deep blue China 
 Found on the table by the wine 
 So fine 
 Well it brings out flavor 
 Like You bring out color in life 
 Oh, I miss You so 
 The feel of forever 
 Oh, that taste I know 
 It hurts to remember 
 Unfortunately high 
 Ironically dissatisfied 
 I miss You 
 I miss You 
 I miss You 
 Oh, I miss You so 
 The feel of forever 
 Oh, that taste I know 
 It hurts to remember 
 I had a fleeting thought this morning 
 And I mentioned You today 
 It breaks my heart just to know You in part 
 And not to be with You where You are 
 Oh, I miss You so 
 The feel of forever 
 Oh, that taste I know 
 It hurts to remember 
 Oh, I miss You so 
 The feel of forever 
 Oh, that taste I know

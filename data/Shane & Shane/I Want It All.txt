Use me, break me, waste me on You, Lord 
 Ruin me, take me, waste me on You 
 For to die is to live... 
 To starve is to feast 
 And less of me is more of Jesus 
 Lord, I want it all 
 Lord, I want it all 
 If I lose my life 
 I gain everything 
 And at the cross 
 Away with all death's sting 
 Lord, I want it all 
 Lord, I want it all 
 Use me, break me, waste me on You, Lord, oh 
 Ruin me, take me, waste me on You 
 To starve is to feast 
 And less of me is more of Jesus 
 Lord, I want it all 
 Lord, I want it all 
 If I lose my life 
 I gain everything 
 And at the cross 
 Away with all death's sting 
 Lord, I want it all 
 Lord, I want it all 
 There is power in the blood 
 There is victory in Jesus 
 Come in power, wash me clean 
 Overwhelm me with Your presence 
 There is power in the blood 
 There is victory in Jesus 
 Help me glory in the cross 
 Help me find my gain in loss

You are changing me from the inside out 
 Something deep within is welling up in praise 
 You're compelling me with unfailing love 
 Oh to lose my life in You that I might live 
 Oh You loved me and love me 
 And You gave Yourself for me 
 You have resurrected my heart from the grave 
 Hey hey hey 
 You have resurrected my heart from the grave 
 Hey hey hey 
 I'm alive 
 You are telling me who I really am 
 I've been crucified with Christ and I no longer live 
 But He lives in me and the life I live 
 In the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God. 
 Oh Who loved me and loves me 
 And Who gave Himself for me 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost but now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see

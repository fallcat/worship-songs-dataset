I sing for joy 
 In my remorse 
 A well within prosperity's curse 
 That drowns the mighty oak of pride 
 But feeds the root of God inside. 
 In You 
 I find my rest 
 In You 
 I find my death 
 In You 
 I find my all and my emptiness 
 Somehow it all makes sense 
 In You I'm rich 
 When I've been made poor 
 Comfort found when I mourn 
 The prideful one You see from afar 
 Drawing near to low, broken hearts. 
 In You 
 I find my rest 
 In You 
 I find my death 
 In You 
 I find my all and my emptiness 
 But it all makes sense

May my life be written down 
 Written on a scroll 
 Written on a stone 
 May my words be written down 
 With an iron pen 
 With a rock on lead 
 For I know... 
 That my Redeemer lives 
 That my Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer, He shall stand 
 Stand on the earth 
 And when my skin is gone 
 In my flesh I shall see God 
 And my eyes behold 
 How my heart it yearns 
 My heart it yearns... 
 That my Redeemer lives 
 That my Redeemer lives 
 Yes my Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 Not by power or might or strength 
 Or riches, wealth or fame 
 May my life be written down because 
 I know, I know... 
 That my Redeemer lives 
 My Redeemer lives 
 Yes my Redeemer lives 
 He lives, He lives 
 He lives, He lives

The Lord is the Spirit 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is, now 
 There is liberty 
 And the Spirit lives inside of me 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is, now 
 There is liberty, there is liberty, 
 There is liberty 
 For freedom You set me free 
 And yes, I am free indeed 
 You rewrote my name 
 And shackled my shame 
 You opened my eyes to see 
 I am free 
 When the spirit of the world 
 Comes to kill me and enslave me I will say 
 There is liberty 
 For the chains of sin that once entangled me 
 Have been broken, now I'm singing 'cause I'm free 
 There is liberty, there is liberty, 
 There is liberty 
 For freedom You set me free 
 And yes, I am free indeed 
 You rewrote my name 
 And shackled my shame 
 You opened my eyes to see 
 I am free 
 The storm rolled in 
 It was dark in the land 
 As the Son of Man 
 Was crucified 
 You don't take his life 
 He laid it down 
 He paid the price 
 And shed His blood 
 It is done! 
 The veil is torn 
 He has won 
 And I am free 
 And I am free 
 And I am free 
 I am free 
 For freedom You set me free 
 And yes, I am free indeed 
 You rewrote my name 
 And shackled my shame 
 You opened my eyes to see 
 For freedom You set me free 
 And yes, I am free indeed 
 You rewrote my name 
 And shackled my shame 
 You opened my eyes to see 
 I am free

Lift up the light of Your countenance (2X) 
 Upon us, upon us oh Lord 
 Lift up the light of Your countenance (2X) 
 Upon us, upon us oh Lord 
 For when the Son is lifted up we'll see 
 You are the light of the world 
 Light up our darkness 
 When the night is upon us 
 You are the light of the world 
 Nations will walk by the light 
 Of the glory of a holy God 
 Oh Holy One, brighter than the sun 
 We lift our hands and sing 
 You are glorious, shine Your light on us 
 Till Your light in us is seen

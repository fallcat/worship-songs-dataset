Emmanuel God with US?? 
 Come Lord Jesus 
 Make believe 
 Believe 
 With all Your beauty 
 Mountains groan 
 And seas roar 
 Because all they know 
 Is You for who You are 
 Bright, Morning Star 
 Jesus, make ?? believe 
 Like they believe 
 I sing 'cause of You 
 Maker of faith and love 
 Make believe 
 Believe 
 With all Your beauty 
 I know you don't need me 
 Or anybody else 
 You speak for yourself 
 Our words they sing your praise 
 Still, hearts are far away 
 Jesus, make ?? believe 
 Like they believe 
 "Have you ever in your life commanded the morning, 
 And caused the dawn to know it's place..." (Job 38:12)

May the words of my mouth 
 And the meditations of my heart 
 Be pleasing to You 
 Pleasing to You 
 May the words of my mouth 
 And the meditations of my heart 
 Be pleasing to You my God 
 You're my rock and my redeemer 
 You're the reason that I sing 
 I desire to be a blessing in Your eyes 
 Every hour and every moment 
 Lord I want to be Your servant 
 I desire to be a blessing in Your eyes

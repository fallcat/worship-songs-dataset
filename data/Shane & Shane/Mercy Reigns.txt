She hides her face, it seems too good 
 For Your embrace to find her 
 And say my dove, "your voice is sweet, 
 Show me your form...your form is lovely." 
 You mercy reigns, Your mercy comes 
 Your mercy falls, it rises with the sun 
 You mercy reigns, Your mercy comes 
 Your mercy falls, it rises with the sun 
 It's new every morning... 
 It's new every morning... 
 It's good enough for me 
 No ear has heard a melody 
 As sweet as Yours for her 
 It seems too good, so undeserved 
 My heart faints now, for we are her... 
 You mercy reigns, Your mercy comes 
 Your mercy falls, it rises with the sun 
 You mercy reigns, Your mercy comes 
 Your mercy falls, it rises with the sun 
 I will abide in Your love, Your love, yeah 
 You mercy reigns, Your mercy comes 
 Your mercy falls, it rises with the sun 
 You mercy reigns, Your mercy comes 
 Your mercy falls, it rises with the sun 
 It's new every morning... 
 It's new every morningâ€¦, yeah 
 Oh, yeah 
 It's new every morning... 
 It's new every morning... 
 It's good enough for me

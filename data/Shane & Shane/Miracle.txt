Every week I hear a story of a miracle 
 And if I'm honest I'm tired of seeing none at all 
 I don't need to see a dead man come alive 
 All I want is you to fill me up inside 
 I need You Lord 
 Even more than the air I breathe 
 I need You Lord 
 Right away 
 I need You Lord 
 Every minute of every day 
 I need You Lord 
 Right away 
 Today I'm asking for a miracle 
 Anything you got God big or small 
 I don't need to see the cancer go away 
 All that I want is to know that it will be ok 
 I need you I need you

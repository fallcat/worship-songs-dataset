My hope is built on nothing less 
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness 
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame 
 But wholly lean in Jesus' Name 
 When darkness seems 
 To hide His face 
 I rest on His unchanging grace 
 In every high and stormy gale 
 My anchor holds within the veil 
 On Christ the solid Rock I stand 
 All other ground is sinking sand 
 His oath, His covenant, His blood 
 Support me in the whelming flood 
 When all around my soul gives way 
 He then is all my Hope and Stay 
 When He shall come 
 With trumpet sound 
 Oh may I then in Him be found 
 Dressed in His righteousness alone 
 Faultless to stand before the throne 
 I stand on the Rock Of Ages

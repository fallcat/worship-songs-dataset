Whom have I in heaven but You 
 I desire none but You 
 My heart and flesh may fail but 
 You are the strength of my heart 
 You are my portion forever 
 Whatever things were gain 
 I've counted loss 
 For the sake of my Reward 
 More than that I'm counting 
 Everything a loss compared to this 
 To knowing Christ my Lord

I come to seek Your face 
 Holy Spirit wont You fall on us 
 Speak wisdom to Your people Your saints 
 Fill us with the knowledge of you 
 Fill us with the knowledge of you 
 Overwhelm my heart 
 Overwhelm this place with a passion for Your name 
 I need Your tender mercies 
 Holy Spirit wont you make a change

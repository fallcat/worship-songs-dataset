Oh come, oh come, Emmanuel 
 And ransom captive Israel 
 That mourns in lonely exile here 
 Until the Son of God appear 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, oh Israel 
 Oh come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer 
 Our spirits by Thine advent here 
 Disperse the gloomy clouds of night 
 And death's dark shadows put to flight 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, oh Israel 
 Oh come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free 
 Thine own from Satan's tyranny 
 From depths of hell Thy people save 
 And give them victory over the grave 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, oh Israel 
 Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel 
 Shall come to thee, oh Israel

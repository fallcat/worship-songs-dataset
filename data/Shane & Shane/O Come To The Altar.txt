Are you hurting and broken within 
 Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin 
 Jesus is calling 
 Have you come to the end of yourself 
 Do you thirst for a drink from the well 
 Jesus is calling 
 O come to the altar 
 The Father's arms are open wide 
 Forgiveness was bought with 
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ 
 Leave behind your regrets and mistakes 
 Come today there's no reason to wait 
 Jesus is calling 
 Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy 
 From the ashes a new life is born 
 Jesus is calling, oh 
 O come to the altar 
 The Father's arms are open wide 
 Forgiveness was bought with 
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ 
 O come to the altar 
 The Father's arms are open wide 
 Forgiveness was bought with 
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ 
 Savior, what a Savior 
 Oh what a Savior 
 Isn't He wonderful 
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen 
 Bow down before Him 
 For He is Lord of all 
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen 
 Oh what a Savior 
 Isn't He wonderful 
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen 
 Bow down before Him 
 For He is Lord of all 
 Sing hallelujah, Christ is risen 
 O come to the altar 
 The Father's arms are open wide 
 Forgiveness was bought with, oh 
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ 
 O come to the altar 
 The Father's arms are open wide 
 Forgiveness was bought with 
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ, oh 
 Thank You, Lord 
 Bear your cross as you wait for the crown 
 Tell the world of the treasure you've found

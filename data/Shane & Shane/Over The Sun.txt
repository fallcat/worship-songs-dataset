Sitting around the fireplace 
 With a friend who's been through it all 
 Solomon, wisest one 
 Tell me what you have found 
 Under the sun, under the sun 
 He answered 
 Get over, 
 Get over, 
 Get over the sun 
 Where life is hidden 
 Then he put on 
 A sombre face 
 Talked about how 
 The rich man will waste 
 Away in the ground 
 Where the poor man is found 
 Painted up, like a clown 
 Under the sun, under the sun 
 He answers 
 Son you'll soon be done 
 A life spent on some shiny god 
 Who leaves you empty 
 Get over, 
 Get over, 
 Get over the sun 
 Where life is hidden

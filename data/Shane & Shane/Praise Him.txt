Everything that has a breath 
 Everything that takes a step 
 Everything from up above 
 Here on earth sing of His love 
 Everyone who's on a mountain 
 Everyone in the driest place Praise Him 
 Praise Him 
 Praise Him in the morning 
 When the feeling's gone 
 Praise Him in the evening 
 When you're all alone 
 Praise Him in the noonday 
 When you're moving along 
 Praise Him while you have another moment To sing this song 
 Praise You in the morning 
 When the feeling's gone 
 Praise You in the evening 
 When I'm all alone 
 Praise You in the noonday 
 When I'm moving along 
 Praise You while I have another moment To sing this song

Give thanks to the Lord for He is good 
 His love endures forever 
 He is my strength and He's my song 
 His love endures forever 
 I will proclaim what He has done 
 His love endures forever 
 I will enter and give thanks to Him 
 This holy gate the righteous may enter 
 I will give You thanks 
 You answered me, You are my salvation 
 This is the day the Lord has made 
 I will rejoice and be glad in it 
 This is the day the Lord has made

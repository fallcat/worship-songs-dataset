How long, oh Lord will You forget me? 
 How long, oh Lord, will You hide, hide Your face from me? 
 How long must I wrestle with me 
 And everyday have sorrow in my heart, sorrow in my heart? 
 I will wait on You, I will wait on You, I will wait on You 
 Look on me Lord and answer me 
 Give my eyes light or I will sleep in death, I will sleep in death 
 My enemies say, "I will overcome Him" 
 And my foes rejoice even when I fall, I don't want to fall 
 For I will trust in Your unfailing love 
 My heart rejoices in Your salvation, I will sing to the Lord

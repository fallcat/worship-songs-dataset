You wrote the story of my life 
 You go before you fall behind, yeah 
 Before a breath beyond my death 
 You are with me all the way 
 To everlasting 
 Oh I can't run, I can't hide 
 Even darkness is a light 
 From the lowest place to the highest praise 
 You are worthy 
 Amazing love how can it be 
 Far too wonderful for me 
 There's only one thing left to say 
 You are worthy, oh 
 Search me God and know my heart 
 Try me, know my anxious thoughts, yeah 
 Find the weakness in me and lead me in the way 
 Everlasting 
 Oh I can't run, I can't hide 
 Even darkness is a light 
 From the lowest place to the highest praise 
 You are worthy 
 Amazing love how can it be 
 Far too wonderful for me 
 There's only one thing left to say 
 You are worthy, oh 
 You formed me in my mothers womb 
 You know my frame, my flesh, and bone 
 Oh, how wonderfully made 
 Oh I can't describe it's way too hard 
 You see me through and through 
 And call me loved 
 What a wonderful grace, oh 
 Oh I can't run, I can't hide 
 Even darkness is a light 
 From the lowest place to the highest praise 
 You are worthy 
 Amazing love how can it be 
 Far too wonderful for me 
 There's only one thing left to say 
 You are worthy, oh

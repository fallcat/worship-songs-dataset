Hear my prayer, give Your ear 
 In Your faithfulness answer me 
 In Your righteousness do not judge 
 For no one is righteous 
 Teach me to do Your will Lord 
 For you are my God 
 Your Spirit is good good good 
 Lead me on level ground Lord 
 For You are my God 
 Your Spirit is good 
 It is good 
 Revive me, revive me 
 Not for me but for Your name 
 In Your mercy deliver me from my enemies 
 Revive me 
 I rememebr days of old 
 Your works I meditate oh Lord 
 I consider all the works of Your hands 
 I lift up my hands to you 
 My soul longs

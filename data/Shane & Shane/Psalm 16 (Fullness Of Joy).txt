Preserve me, O God 
 For I find rest in You alone 
 I say to the Lord 
 "You are my Lord, I have no good 
 Apart from You" 
 All sons and daughters 
 Brothers, sisters my delight 
 Let's sing together 
 "No other gods shall satisfy" 
 God You satisfy 
 In Your presence 
 There is fullness 
 Of joy 
 Of joy 
 You give me counsel 
 My heart instructs me in the night 
 You are before me 
 Because You're for me 
 I'm alright, it'll be alright 
 It'll be alright 
 In Your presence 
 There is fullness 
 Of joy 
 Of joy 
 At Your right hand 
 There are pleasures 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 My heart is glad and my soul rejoice 
 My flesh it dwells secure 
 Because You put on flesh 
 Lived a blameless life 
 My curse on the cross You bore 
 Then You ripped the doors off the City of Death 
 And the chains fell to the floor 
 Now the serpent's crushed 
 It has been finished 
 And You reign forever more 
 You are my portion 
 My cup and you make my lot secure 
 The lines have fallen 
 For me in pleasant places 
 A beautiful inheritance 
 In Your presence 
 There is fullness 
 Of joy 
 Of joy 
 At Your right hand 
 There are pleasures 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore 
 In Your presence 
 There is fullness 
 Of joy 
 Of joy 
 At Your right hand 
 There are pleasures 
 Forevermore 
 Forevermore

The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want 
 In green pastures He makes me lie down 
 He restores my soul and leads me on for His name 
 For His great name 
 Surely goodness, surely mercy 
 Right beside me all my days 
 And I will dwell in Your house forever 
 And bless Your holy name 
 You prepare a table right before me 
 In the presence of my enemies 
 Though the arrow flies and the terror of night 
 Is at my door, I'll trust you Lord 
 Surely goodness, surely mercy 
 Right beside me all my days 
 And I will dwell in Your house forever 
 And bless Your holy name 
 Even though I walk through the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil 
 Even though I walk through the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 You are on my side 
 Even though I walk through the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil 
 Even though I walk through the valley 
 Of the shadow of death 
 You are on my side 
 Surely goodness, surely mercy 
 Right beside me all my days 
 And I will dwell in Your house forever 
 And bless Your holy name

The Lord is my light 
 And my salvation 
 And whom shall I fear 
 Whom shall I fear 
 The Lord is my strength 
 The stronghold of my life 
 And whom shall I fear 
 Whom shall I fear 
 And you said, "Seek my face" 
 Your face oh God I seek 
 One thing I ask and I will seek 
 To dwell in the house of the Lord all my days 
 To gaze upon your beauty, worship at your feet 
 Oh, one thing I seek 
 The Lord is my light 
 And my salvation 
 And whom shall I fear 
 Whom shall I fear 
 The Lord is my strength 
 The stronghold of my life 
 And whom shall I fear 
 Whom shall I fear 
 And you said, "Seek my face" 
 Your face oh God I seek 
 One thing I ask and I will seek 
 To dwell in the house of the Lord all my days 
 To gaze upon your beauty, worship at your feet 
 Oh, one thing I seek 
 Holy fire 
 Abba Father 
 My redeemer 
 My delight 
 Holy, holy 
 God almighty 
 You're the one thing 
 That I desire 
 One thing I ask and I will seek 
 To dwell in the house of the Lord all my days 
 To gaze upon your beauty, worship at your feet 
 Oh, one thing I seek 
 Only one thing

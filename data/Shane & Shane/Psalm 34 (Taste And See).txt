I sought the Lord 
 And He answered me 
 And delivered me 
 From every fear 
 Those who look on Him 
 Are radiant 
 They'll never be ashamed 
 They'll never be ashamed 
 This poor man cried 
 And the Lord heard me 
 And saved me from 
 My enemies 
 The Son of God 
 Surrounds His saints 
 He will deliver them 
 He will deliver them 
 Like a fire, the Lord in me 
 Come exalt His name together 
 Glorify the Lord with me 
 Come exalt His name forever 
 Taste and see 
 That the Lord is good 
 Oh bless us here 
 Who hides in Him 
 Oh fear the Lord 
 Oh all you saints 
 He'll give you everything 
 He'll give you everything 
 Like a fire, the Lord with me 
 Come exalt His name together 
 Glorify the Lord with me 
 Come exalt His name forever 
 Let us bless the Lord 
 Every day and night 
 Never ending praise 
 May our incense rise 
 Like a fire, the Lord in me 
 Come exalt His name together 
 Glorify the Lord with me 
 Come exalt His name forever

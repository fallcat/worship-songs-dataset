My heart burst at its banks 
 Spilling with beauty and goodness 
 I pour it out as a song to my King 
 Shaping the rivers into words 
 What grace pours from your lips 
 The sound calls the midnight to morning 
 The melody turns my winter into spring 
 I echo it now in my worship 
 Ten thousand strong 
 You're the fairest of all 
 Fairest in heaven and earth 
 Of the children of men 
 You're the fairest of them 
 Fairest in heaven and earth 
 Your heart burst at the seams 
 Flowing with blood and with water 
 A song of love pouring out from the tree singing 
 For the joy set before me 
 You ransomed Your bride 
 On the day that You died 
 Ascended to heaven in glory 
 She stands clothed in white 
 With her head lifted high singing 
 "Come and return in Your glory" 
 You ransomed Your bride 
 On the day that You died 
 Ascended to heaven in glory 
 We stand clothed in white 
 With our voice lifted high singing 
 "Come and return in Your glory"

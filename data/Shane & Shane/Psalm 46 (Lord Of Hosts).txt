O come behold the works of God 
 The nations at His feet 
 He breaks the bow and bends the spear 
 And tells the wars to cease 
 O Mighty One of Israel 
 You are on our side 
 We walk by faith in God 
 Who burns the chariots with fire 
 Lord of Hosts, You're with us 
 With us in the fire 
 With us as a shelter 
 With us in the storm 
 You will lead us 
 Through the fiercest battle 
 Oh where else would we go 
 But with the Lord of Hosts 
 O God of Jacob, fierce and great 
 You lift Your voice to speak 
 The earth it bows and all 
 The mountains move into the sea 
 O Lord You know the hearts of men 
 And still you let them live 
 O God who makes the mountains melt 
 Come wrestle us and win 
 O God who makes the mountains melt 
 Come wrestle us and win 
 Lord of Hosts, You're with us 
 With us in the fire 
 With us as a shelter 
 With us in the storm 
 You will lead us 
 Through the fiercest battle 
 Oh where else would we go 
 But with the Lord of Hosts 
 Though oceans roar, You are the Lord of all 
 The one who calms the wind and waves and makes my heart be still 
 Though the earth gives way, the mountains move into the sea 
 The nations rage, I know my God is in control 
 Though oceans roar, You are the Lord of all 
 The one who calms the wind and waves and makes my heart be still 
 Though the earth gives way, the mountains move into the sea 
 The nations rage, I know my God is in control 
 Lord of Hosts, You're with us 
 With us in the fire 
 With us as a shelter 
 With us in the storm 
 You will lead us 
 Through the fiercest battle 
 Oh where else could we go 
 But with the Lord of Hosts 
 You are with us 
 With us in the fire 
 With us as a shelter 
 With us in the storm 
 You will lead us 
 Through the fiercest battle 
 Oh where else could we go 
 But with the Lord of Hosts

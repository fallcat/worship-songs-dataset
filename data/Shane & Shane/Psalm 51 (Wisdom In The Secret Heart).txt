Behold I was brought forth in iniquity 
 And in sin and my mother conceived me 
 Behold you delight in the truth and the inward me 
 And you teach me, wisdom in the secret heart 
 Our sins not far but right in front of me 
 Against you and you alone God I am guilty 
 Wash me thoroughly cleanse me from iniquity 
 And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart 
 Create in me a clean heart, oh God 
 Renew a right spirit within me, oh God 
 Cast me not away from Your presence 
 Take not Your Holy Spirit 
 Restore in me the joy of Your salvation 
 And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart 
 Send me the chief of sinners to proclaim 
 Come be forgiven the sin of the lamb of God was slain 
 Open my lips and my mouth will declare your endless praise 
 And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart 
 Create in me a clean heart, oh God 
 Renew a right spirit within me, oh God 
 Cast me not away from Your presence 
 Take not Your Holy Spirit 
 Restore in me the joy of Your salvation 
 And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart 
 Wisdom in the secret heart 
 The Lord is gracious 
 And slow to anger 
 Rich in love, He is good to all 
 Good to all 
 Create in me a clean heart, oh God 
 Renew a right spirit within me, oh God 
 Cast me not away from Your presence 
 Take not Your Holy Spirit 
 Restore in me the joy of Your salvation 
 And teach me, wisdom in the secret heart 
 Wisdom in the secret heart

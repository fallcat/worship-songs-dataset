He's the only one strong enough to lean 
 My heaviness against the weight of all my sin 
 Falling on a rock, leaning on a fortress 
 Oh the wall of God, Jesus, He won't move 
 On God I rest my salvation 
 My fortress shall not be shaken 
 My mighty rock and my glorious 
 I lay my head upon His chest, on God I rest 
 Oh, I am calling out 
 Oh my soul, oh my stubborn soul 
 Won't you wait on Him? 
 Wait in the quiet even in your fear 
 Oh your God is here to lean on, He won't move 
 On God I rest my salvation 
 My fortress shall not be shaken 
 My mighty rock and my glorious 
 I lay my head upon His chest 
 He has spoken, hear His voice 
 Oh, I have come for the broken 
 So all you, all you weary come and rest 
 On God I rest my salvation 
 My fortress shall not be shaken 
 My mighty rock and my glorious 
 I lay my head 
 On God I rest my salvation 
 My fortress shall not be shaken 
 My mighty rock and my glorious 
 I lay my head upon His chest 
 On God I rest, on God I rest 
 Oh, on God I rest, oh, on God I rest 
 Today, today, today, on God I rest

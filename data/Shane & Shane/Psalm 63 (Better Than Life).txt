O God You're my God, I seek You 
 Oh my soul it longs for You 
 My flesh faints for You in this land 
 This dry land where there is no drink 
 I've looked upon You in this place 
 Be holding your power and glory, Lord 
 Because Your love is better than life is 
 I will praise You as long as I'm alive 
 And in the face of precious Jesus 
 Oh my soul will be satisfied 
 O God You're my God, I seek You 
 Oh my soul it longs for You 
 My flesh faints for You in this land 
 This dry land where there is no drink 
 I've looked upon You in this place 
 Be holding your power and glory, Lord 
 You have been my help 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 I'll sing for joy 
 You have been my help 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 I'll sing 
 I'll sing 
 Because Your love is better than life is 
 I will praise You as long as I'm alive 
 And in the face of precious Jesus 
 Oh my soul will be satisfied

You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord 
 Who abide in his shadow for life 
 Say to the Lord, "My Refuge, my Rock in whom I trust" 
 And He will raise you up on eagles' wings 
 Bare you on the breath of dawn 
 Make you to shine like the sun 
 And hold you in the palm 
 Of His hand 
 The snare of the fowler will never capture you 
 And famine will bring you no fear 
 Under His wings your refuge 
 His faithfulness your shield 
 And He will raise you up on eagles' wings 
 Bare you on the breath of dawn 
 Make you to shine like the sun 
 And hold you in the palm 
 Of His hand 
 You need not fear the terror of the night 
 Nor the arrow that flies by day 
 Though thousands fall about you 
 Near you it shall not come 
 And He will raise you up on eagles' wings 
 Bare you on the breath of dawn 
 Make you to shine like the sun 
 And hold you in the palm 
 Of His hand

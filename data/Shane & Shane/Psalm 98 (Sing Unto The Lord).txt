Let the seas roar and all that fills it 
 Let the world rejoice and all who are in it 
 Let the rivers clap their hands 
 And the mountains sing 
 Strike up the band 
 Come usher in Jesus the King 
 Sing unto the Lord 
 A new song for what He's done 
 He's made known to us 
 His salvation 
 Make a joyful noise 
 Oh all the earth 
 Break forth in joyous song 
 Sing praise 
 Moses and Aaron were before Him 
 Samuel called upon His name 
 And He answered them 
 Through a cloud by day 
 What they knew by faith 
 We know by name 
 Jesus the King 
 Sing unto the Lord 
 A new song for what He's done 
 He's made known to us 
 His salvation 
 Make a joyful noise 
 Oh all the earth 
 Break forth in joyous song 
 Sing praise, sing praise 
 Sing praise, sing hallelujah 
 Sing praise, sing praise 
 Sing praise, sing hallelujah 
 Sing praise, sing praise 
 Sing praise, sing hallelujah 
 Sing unto the Lord 
 A new song for what He's done 
 He's made known to us 
 His salvation 
 Make a joyful noise 
 Oh all the earth 
 Break forth in joyous song 
 Sing praise 
 Sing praise

In the light of the King's face 
 There is life 
 Giving favor to His children 
 Like a cloud of rain 
 Rain is falling in His presence 
 On our thirsty hearts 
 As we seek the knowledge 
 Of your will 
 Oh God impart 
 Oh never, ever ending river 
 Fill us up 
 Rain down upon us 
 Rain down upon us 
 We need You 
 We need You 
 Rain down 
 One thing we ask 
 And Lord we humbly seek 
 That in Your shelter we can hide 
 And gaze upon the King 
 In His presence we find fullness 
 We are satisfied 
 Come, Lord Jesus, let us look 
 Upon You with enlightened eyes 
 You are raining down and 
 We are filling up 
 You keep raining down and 
 We keep filling up

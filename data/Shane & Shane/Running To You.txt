It's a cold night in December 
 I can barely stand 
 Lord help me to remember 
 Who I am, oh, who I am 
 To You 
 I'm a dead man raised 
 A liberated slave 
 I'm runnin' to You 
 My hands are raised 
 I'm giving everything 
 And I'm running 
 My heart just started beating 
 Your breath filled up my lungs 
 My eyes are finally seeing 
 What You've done 
 And who I am 
 To You 
 I'm running 
 I'm running 
 I'm running 
 Running to You

Just a singin' a gospel song today 
 Get ready to send the years 
 Of guilt and shame away 
 The years of failing 
 The years of nailing up yourself 
 To a cross you can't bear 
 That's why He's there 
 What a beautiful day 
 When He washed all our sins away 
 What a beautiful day 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace through faith 
 Through faith 
 And in the faith I have to sing 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah to my King 
 It's freely given 
 That I might not boast in myself but in Him 
 What a beautiful day 
 When He washed all our sins away 
 What a beautiful day 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace through faith 
 Through faith, yeah 
 Can't sing it enough 
 Say it enough 
 Play it enough 
 When will I get it 
 I can't earn it 
 And no I don't deserve 
 Can't say it enough 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace you have been saved 
 By grace through faith 
 Through faith

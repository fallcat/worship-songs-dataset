There is a wicked man in me 
 Wanting the wicked man's disease 
 Fleeting pleasures, but pleasures indeed 
 O Lord, take my envy of these things 
 And the prideful war within 
 Take me to the place of sweet surrender 
 For You are, You were, You will always be better... 
 This is a song of surrender 
 For whom have I but You 
 You are! You are better! 
 Forever so much better than the world 
 You are my portion, You are my portion, 
 You are my portion 
 My never ending, overflowing Lord 
 My reward 
 My reward 
 My portion, Lord 
 You are Lord... 
 Creator of created things 
 Greatest personality 
 No ear has heard 
 Nor mind conceived 
 And though Your Spirit groans in me 
 And all creation sings of Your return 
 My feet are slipping, be my help 
 For You are, You were, You will always be better... 
 This is a song of surrender 
 For whom have I but You 
 You are! You are better! 
 Forever so much better than the world 
 You are my portion, You are my portion, 
 You are my portion 
 My never ending, overflowing Lord 
 My reward 
 My reward 
 You are my portion, Lord 
 This is a song of surrender 
 For whom have I but You 
 You are! You are better! 
 Forever so much better than the world 
 You are my portion, You are my portion, 
 You are my portion 
 My never ending, overflowing Lord 
 My reward 
 You're my reward 
 My portion, Lord

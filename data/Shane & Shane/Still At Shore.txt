When pain turns to years and goes away 
 A memory far gone, so bitter sweet 
 Sweet it is, it is, to taste recovery 
 The loss of my friend 
 And why haunts this hunger to love her 
 My ship set its sail a long time ago 
 And my mind has said its farewell 
 And my lips have declared it's time 
 But my heart cannot say it's goodbye 
 Now it's only in my dreams, have I been there 
 Her eyes so in love, her kiss so real 
 Now if only I could stay and dream a while 
 If a dream lasts a lifetime 
 But why haunts this hunger to love her 
 My ship set its sail a long time ago 
 And my mind has said it's farewell 
 And my lips have declared it's time 
 But my heart cannot say it's goodbye 
 Say it's goodbye 
 My ship set sail but still at shore 
 My heart cannot say it's goodbye

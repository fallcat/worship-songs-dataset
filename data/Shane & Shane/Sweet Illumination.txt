One thing, one thing 
 This is what I desire, this is what I desire 
 Sweet illumination, sweet illumination 
 That i may gaze upon His face 
 O, to know this man 
 Sweet illumination, sweet illumination 
 To glory in the presence of the King 
 Behold the sweet essence of this one thing 
 That I may know the Spring within me 
 The Spring, so sweet 
 That i may gaze upon His face 
 O, to know this man 
 Sweet illumination, sweet illumination 
 To glory in the presence of the King 
 Behold the sweet essence of this one thing 
 That I may know the Spring within me 
 As it rises the Spring, so sweet

Thirsty, I'm thirsty for you 
 In a dry land with no drink, I need you 
 I know you made a home, inside this heart of stone 
 So turn it into flesh, Spirit, soften it 
 I give you all I have, I'm holding nothing back 
 Jesus, I am yours 
 Jesus, I am yours 
 Take over, Lover of my Soul 
 Take control 
 I surrender, there's nothing I want more 
 Than to know you, Lord 
 To know you

 Than to know you, Lord 
 What am I supposed to do with all my kingdoms next to you 
 You're the Lord, You're the Lord 
 I could gain the world and more 
 It's all nothing next to you 
 My reward, my reward

I've tried more of me 
 And I've come up dry 
 Trading You for things 
 Things that go away 
 My happiness is found in less 
 Of me and more of You 
 My happiness is found in less 
 Of me and more of You 
 I have found the answer is 
 To love You and be loved by You alone 
 All right! all right! all right! 
 You crucify me and the world to me 
 And I will only boast in You 
 All right! all right! all right! 
 I'm so satisfied 
 At the thought of You 
 Growing up in me 
 Covering everything 
 My happiness is found in less 
 Of me and more of You 
 My happiness is found in less 
 Of me and more of You 
 You are, You are (loved by me) 
 You are, You are (You're loved by me) 
 You are, You are (You're loved by me) 
 You are, You are, You are

Our Father who art in heaven 
 Hallowed by Thy Name 
 Thy kingdom come 
 Thy will be done 
 On earth as it is in heaven 
 Give us this day our daily bread 
 And forgive our debts 
 As we have forgiven them 
 And lead us not into temptation 
 Deliver us from the evil one 
 All Yours is the kingdom the 
 Power the glory forever

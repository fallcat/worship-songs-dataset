Hey, Hey, sweet daughter 
 I'm so proud to be your father 
 Each day is like a gift from God 
 Hey, Hey, sweet daughter 
 There's no music like your laughter 
 And your smile is like the rising sun 
 You know I've loved you from the start 
 So come in close, take my hand 
 While daddy shares his heart 
 I wish that I could be your everything 
 Be the one to give you all the things you need 
 Sometimes I'm gonna let you down 
 There's someone if you just believe 
 He'll be your hero like He's always been for me 
 Darling, Jesus is the One you need 
 No matter what you walk through 
 He will always love you 
 Just the way you are 
 For there's nothing in this world 
 That I want for my baby girl 
 Than to be happy ever after 
 The story of your life is still untold 
 I pray the king of all the universe 
 Would make your heart His home 
 I wish that I could be your everything 
 Be the one to give you all the things you need 
 Sometimes I'm gonna let you down 
 There's someone if you just believe 
 He'll be your hero like he's always been for me 
 Darling, Jesus is the One 
 Who will never leave, he's been there all along 
 Oh when you're ready, you can find True Love 
 I wish that I could be your everything 
 Be the one to give you all the things you need 
 Sometimes I'm gonna let you down 
 There's someone if you just believe 
 He'll be your hero like He's always been for me 
 Darling, Jesus is the One you need

There is none like you 
 No one else can touch my heart like you do 
 And I can search for all eternity long 
 And find there is none like you 
 None like you 
 None like you 
 Not one like you 
 No, not one 
 Not one like you 
 Your mercy flows like a river wide 
 And healing comes in your name 
 And help bless children are safe in your arms 
 There is none like you 
 There is none like you 
 No one else can touch my heart like you do 
 And I can search for all eternity long 
 And find there is none like you 
 There is none like you 
 No one else can touch my heart like you do 
 And I can search for all eternity long 
 And find there is none like you

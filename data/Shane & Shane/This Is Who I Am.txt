I am a new creation 
 The old is passed away 
 And I'm made new 
 I'm made new 
 And I have been adopted 
 A door has opened up 
 For me to know You 
 Be like You 
 This Is Who I Am 
 I've been born again 
 The cross is my defense, 
 My hope secure 
 Now my life is in Your hand 
 On Your every word I stand 
 Lord, I'm finding who I am 
 In all You are 
 When my heart condemns me 
 Tells me I am guilty 
 You're greater 
 You're greater 
 Jesus You have searched me 
 And even then I find (or) And deep within I find 
 You have loved me 
 And You love me 
 This Is Who I Am 
 I've been born again 
 The cross is my defense, 
 My hope secure 
 Now my life is in Your hand 
 On Your every word I stand 
 Lord, I'm finding who I am 
 In all You are 
 For He made Him Who knew no sin 
 To be sin 
 On our behalf was crucified 
 That we could be the righteousness of our Creator 
 I am a new creation 
 The old is passed away 
 And I'm made new 
 I'm made new 
 This Is Who I Am? 2 xs

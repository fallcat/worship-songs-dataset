If You were hungry 
 Would we give You food? 
 If You were thirsty 
 Would we give You drink? 
 If You were a stranger 
 Would we let You in? 
 What would be the song we'd sing to You 
 When they're in need? 
 Would it be an empty hallelujah 
 To the King? 
 Turn down the music 
 Turn down the noise 
 Turn up Your voice, oh God 
 And let us hear the sound 
 Of people broken 
 Willing to love 
 Give us Your heart, oh God 
 A new song rising up 
 And if You were naked 
 Would we give You clothes? 
 If You were an orphan 
 Would we give our home? 
 And if You were in prison 
 Would we visit You? 
 What would be the song we'd sing to You 
 When they're in need? 
 Would it be an empty hallelujah 
 To the King? 
 Turn down the music 
 Turn down the noise 
 Turn up Your voice, oh God 
 Let us hear the sound 
 Of people broken 
 Willing to love 
 Give us Your heart, oh God 
 A new song rising up 
 Let it be our worship 
 Let it be our true religion 
 In this world but not of it 
 Holding on to our confession 
 Let it be our worship 
 Let it be our true religion 
 In this world but not of it 
 Holding on to our confession 
 Turn down the music 
 Turn down the noise 
 Turn up Your voice, oh God 
 Let us hear the sound 
 Of people broken 
 Willing to love 
 Give us Your heart, oh God 
 A new song rising 
 A new song rising 
 New song rising up

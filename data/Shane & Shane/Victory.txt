Would I give you all I have? 
 What do I have to give that you don't already own? 
 I'm yours, You've made me great 
 Oh what could be great about my life, 
 None other than the one and only God living inside? 
 I'm yours, You've made me great 
 Your steadfast love gives 
 The victory, the victory, the victory 
 Oh Your love has made me great 
 Great (you have made me great) 
 You made me great (you have made me great) 
 You made me great (you have made me great) 
 Your steadfast love gives 
 The victory, the victory, the victory 
 Your steadfast love gives 
 The victory, the victory, the victory 
 Oh your love has made me 
 Your love has made me 
 Your love has made me great

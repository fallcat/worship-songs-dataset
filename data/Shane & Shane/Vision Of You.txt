Come meet us, King Jesus. 
 Oh wind of change blow through this temple. 
 Sweet spirit of God, come and mend our hearts. 
 For all we have are songs. Unless you come. 
 Awaken what's inside of me. 
 Tune my heart to all You are in me. 
 Even though you're here, God come. 
 May the vision of You be the death of me. 
 And even though You've given everything. 
 Jesus come! 
 Come free us, King Jesus. 
 It's the only way that freedom is given. 
 From you and you alone in the work You've already done. 
 All we have are songs, unless You come. 
 Awaken what's inside of me. 
 Tune my heart to all You are in me. 
 Even though you're here, God come. 
 May the vision of You be the death of me. 
 And even though You've given everything. 
 Jesus come! 
 Here we are, Lord, in this place. 
 Crying out for Your embrace. 
 To hear Your voice more than songs. 
 Awaken what's inside of me. 
 Tune my heart to all You are in me. 
 Even though you're here, God come. 
 May the vision of You be the death of me. 
 And even though You've given everything. 
 Jesus come!

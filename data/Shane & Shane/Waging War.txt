It haunts me so 
 This gloomy wait 
 That comes and goes without a trace 
 A thousand times I flesh embrace 
 A thousand more, but here for grace 
 To see the Lord, The Promise Land 
 Where in those sins, pearly gates look bland 
 What once was a pearl, now sand 
 That blows away, that blows away in light of him 
 When battle lines become unclear 
 And the waging war is all I hear 
 Lord, sustain me with your voice 
 And the choice to walk in truth 
 To see the Lord, The Promise Land 
 Where in those sins, pearly gates look bland 
 And what was once a pearl, now sand 
 That blows away, that blows away in light of him 
 That I might see this day 
 This waging war 
 Might go away and be no more 
 That I may see his face, and hear him say 
 Son welcome home, the war is over 
 To see the Lord, The Promise Land 
 Where in all sins, pearly gates look bland 
 And what was once a pearl, now sand that blows away 
 That blows away, that blows away in light of him 
 Go away, Oh go away, go away in light of him 
 Oh, blow away a waging war of sin

I will run when I cannot walk 
 I will sing when there is no song 
 I will pray when there is no prayer 
 I will listen when I cannot hear 
 Sitting in the waiting room of silence 
 Waiting for that still soft voice I know 
 Offering my words up to the rooftop to Your heart 
 Trusting that this closet's where You are 
 Lord I know if I change my mind 
 You will change my heart in time 
 Sovereign Lord this time's from You 
 So I sit in the waiting room of silence 
 'Cause it's all about You 
 I will fight when I cannot feel 
 I will trust when You don't seem real 
 I will tell when I cannot speak 
 I will step when I cannot see

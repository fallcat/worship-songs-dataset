Opening the door to dine with Him 
 Traveling to earth to let us in 
 Laying down His glory crown of old 
 Setting up the wedding feast foretold 
 Oh 
 We can't contain our love 
 We turn it up loud 
 We love you, Jesus 
 For so many reasons 
 For death and life and freedom 
 Even now we love You 
 We love you Jesus 
 In and out of seasons 
 In valleys and on top of mountains 
 Even now can we sing 
 What manner of love is this that you would say 
 Your sin is mine - I'll take it to the grave (then rising) 
 Death oh death, where is your sting today? 
 Death is swallowed up in victory 
 We love You, Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! 
 We love You, Jesus! 
 We love you

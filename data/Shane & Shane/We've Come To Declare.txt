Your heart was torn, forgiveness was born 
 Yet through Your pain, You call us by name 
 So that we would be free, yes free indeed 
 Free to run with You to be all that You created us to be 
 In You it is true that we are free (oh Lord we are free) 
 Oh we've come to declare the beauty of the Lord 
 Declare the beauty of the Lord 
 Oh we've come to declare the beauty of the Lord 
 Declare the beauty of the Lord 
 Alleluia we sing 
 Alleluia we sing, yes we praise You O Lord

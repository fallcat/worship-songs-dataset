When I think about the Lord 
 How He saved me, how He raised me 
 How He filled me with the Holy Ghost 
 How He healed me to the uttermost 
 When I think about the Lord 
 How he picked me up 
 Turned me around 
 How He set my feet 
 On solid ground 
 It makes me want to shout...

 Of all the glory, and all the honor 
 And all the praise

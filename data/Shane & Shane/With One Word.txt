With one word the storm will be gone 
 With one word the war will be won 
 With one word I know I can overcome 
 With one word the blind man can see 
 With one word the captive is free 
 With one word: the name of Jesus 
 Your name is sweeter than honey on my lips 
 Your name is power in every circumstance 
 Jesus, in Your name we'll make mountains disappear 
 One word conquers all fear, one word: 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 With one word my soul is relieved 
 With one word the devil will flee 
 With one word my hurricane winds will cease 
 Through one word the world came to be 
 Through one word the world is redeemed 
 Through one word: the name of Jesus 
 Your name is sweeter than honey on my lips 
 Your name is power in every circumstance 
 Jesus, in Your name we'll make mountains disappear 
 One word conquers all fear, one word: 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

I can walk through the storm 
 I can walk by faith when my sight is gone 
 Just as long as you are here with me 
 And I can gain everything 
 But what do I have if I don't have the key 
 Oh I need to know you're here with me 
 Here I am calling out Father 
 Can you hear me, can you hear me 
 I don't want to go without you 
 Here I am can You talk a little louder 
 So I can hear You, I want to hear You 
 I don't want to move without You 
 Even though I believe 
 You've taken up a home inside me 
 And you'll never leave 
 I still need to know You'll never leave 
 Here I am calling out Father 
 Can you hear me, can you hear me 
 I don't want to go without you 
 Here I am can You talk a little louder 
 So I can hear You, I want to hear You 
 I don't want to move without You 
 If Your presence goes I don't want to stay 
 If Your presence stays I don't want to go 
 If Your presence goes I don't want to stay 
 If Your presence stays I don't want to go 
 I need You 
 Here I am calling out Father 
 Can you hear me, can you hear me 
 I don't want to go without you 
 Here I am can You talk a little louder 
 So I can hear You, I want to hear You 
 I don't want to move without You 
 Here I am I'm calling out Father 
 Can you hear me, can you hear me 
 I don't want to go without you 
 Here I am can You talk a little louder 
 So I can hear You, I want to hear You 
 I don't want to move without You

Deliverer you brought us out of the miry clay 
 You set our feet upon a rock and you made us say 
 Holy is the Lord 
 We would declare your thoughts about us one by one 
 It'd be too many to count so we simply come 
 And sing of your great love 
 So we sing... We lift our hands and sing! 
 You are worthy of affection 
 Your the radiance of all of His glory 
 Let adoration fill this place 
 You hold everything together 
 By the word of your immovable power 
 We sing a song of praise! 
 We are the broken down and we are the beaten up 
 But what could stop us from a song of unending love? 
 Holy is the lord 
 You are a treasure, the hope, the bright and morning star 
 You are the lover of our soul and you've won our hearts 
 We sing of your great love 
 So we sing 
 We lift our hands and sing! 
 Worthy are you Lord 
 Worthy are you Lord 
 O worthy are you Lord 
 Of all Praise 
 All Glory to you Lord 
 All Glory to you Lord 
 All Glory to you Lord 
 Forever More 
 Forever More 
 Holy are you Lord 
 Holy are you Lord 
 Holy are you Lord

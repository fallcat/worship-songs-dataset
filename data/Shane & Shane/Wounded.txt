Why since you've wounded my heart 
 Don't You heal it? 
 Why don't You heal? 
 And why since you've stolen my heart, 
 Do you leave it so? 
 Oh this heart of stone. 
 Why don't you carry away my heart 
 You have stolen and left here broken 
 Why don't you carry away my heart 
 Already taken 
 Awaken the dawning of a new heart 
 Where stone begins to bleed 
 For the arrow of God that runs through me 
 Leaves me in need 
 Here in need 
 Awaken 
 How long? How long? How long?

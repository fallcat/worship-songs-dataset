Clean I call you, clean I came to clean you, ------ 
 Here is the call -------- to qualify to run 
 Pleasures flowing here and there 
 From my right hand 
 What's mine is yours 
 Come and hold on to who I am 
 You and I will run 
 You and I will run, forever 
 Lord is good 
 You and I will run 
 Come with what you do not have 
 And buy what's on this earth 
 Feast and drink the bounty's great 
 I know you hear the town, you heard 
 Have you heard 
 You and I will run 
 You and I will run, forever 
 Lord is good 
 You and I will run 
 You are clean 
 I call you clean 
 You are clean 
 You are clean 
 You are clean 
 You are clean 
 Clean, clean 
 That's what I'm wanting 
 You and I will run 
 You and I will run, forever 
 Lord is good 
 You and I will run

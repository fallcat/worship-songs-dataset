You say "I'm rich and I'm well off" 
 You say "I'm wealthy and I'm doing okay" 
 But don't you realize that you are wretched 
 You are blind, you are poor and you are naked 
 I have white garments to clothe your shame 
 Clothe your shame 
 He who hears let him be found 
 With his face into the ground 
 Where repentance is found 
 Where Jesus is found 
 I stand and knock 
 Do you hear my voice 
 Sung by gold from me refined by the fire 
 I'll come in and we will dine 
 And you'll be rich, and you'll be fine, 
 And you'll be mine 
 I have white garments to clothe your shame 
 Clothe your shame 
 He who hears let him be found 
 With his face into the ground 
 Where repentance is found 
 Where Jesus is found 
 Where Jesus is found 
 Where Jesus is found 
 Where Jesus is found 
 Yeah 
 He who hears let him be found 
 With his face into the ground 
 Where repentance is found 
 He who hears let him be found 
 With his face into the ground 
 Where repentance is found 
 Where Jesus is found

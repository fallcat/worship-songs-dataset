Your grace is sufficient for me 
 Your strength is made perfect 
 When I am weak 
 All that I cling to, I lay at your feet 
 Your grace is sufficient for me 
 Your grace is sufficient for me 
 Your strength is made perfect 
 When I am weak 
 All that I cling to, I lay at your feet 
 Your grace is sufficient for me 
 Your grace is sufficient for me 
 Your strength is made perfect 
 When I am weak 
 All that I cling to, I lay at your feet 
 Your grace is sufficient, your grace is sufficient, your grace is sufficient for me 
 To see the Lord, the promise land 
 Where in all scent, pearly gate look bland 
 And what was once a pearl must send 
 That blows away, that blows away in light of him

I'm overcoming fear 
 With Your perfect love, Your perfect love 
 You're opening my ears to hear 
 The sound of a lover's voice 
 You're calling out, You're calling out 
 Let me see Your face, Your loving face 
 Your love tears me up 
 And when its done 
 Puts me together 
 I'm overcoming fear 
 With Your perfect love, Your perfect love 
 You're opening my ears to hear 
 The sound of a lover's voice 
 You're calling out, You're calling out 
 Let me see Your face, Your loving face 
 Your love tears me up 
 And when its done 
 Puts me together 
 Your love calls me out 
 Of my death and my failure 
 Love, Your love 
 Your love tears me up 
 And when its done 
 Puts me together 
 Your love calls me out 
 Of my death and my failure 
 Your love tears me up 
 And when its done 
 Puts me together 
 Your love calls me out 
 Of my death and my failure 
 Love, Your love, Your love

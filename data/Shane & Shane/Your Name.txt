As morning dawns and evening fades 
 You inspire songs of praise 
 That rise from earth to touch Your heart 
 And glorify Your Name 
 Your Name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your Name is a shelter like no other 
 Your Name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save 
 But Your Name 
 Jesus, in Your Name we pray 
 Come and fill our hearts today 
 Lord, give us strength to live for You 
 And glorify Your Name 
 Your Name is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your Name is a shelter like no other 
 Your Name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save but Your Name 
 Your Name 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 It's the name above all name 
 It's the name above... 
 Your Name, is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your Name, is a shelter like no other 
 Your Name, let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save but Your Name 
 That your Name (Your Name) is a strong and mighty tower 
 Your Name (Your Name) is a shelter like no other 
 Your Name (Your Name), let the nations sing it louder 
 'Cause nothing has the power to save but Your Name 
 Ooh. yeah 
 It's the name above all name 
 It's the name above all name...

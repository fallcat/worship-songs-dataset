Fall on me 
 Fall on me 
 Let your manifested glory fall on me 
 As we enter Lord, to worship 
 And we get on one accord 
 Your presence fills the temple 
 Everything we need and more 
 Your manifested glory 
 It is wonderful to see 
 I seek your face 
 Here in this place 
 Oh come let, it, fall on me 
 Fall on me 
 Fall on me 
 Let your manifested glory, fall on me 
 Fall on me 
 Fall on me 
 Let your manifested glory fall on me 
 Let your manifested glory fall on me 
 Beginning at the 5th manifested glory? 
 Lord, Lord, Lord, come on 
 Lord, come on 
 Some soul, is depending on you Lord 
 Oh yes it is 
 Someone is looking, to mend, a broken heart 
 Yes they are 
 Someone's lonely and they need you, to comfort them 
 To comfort them 
 Someone's lost and they need your guidance 
 Oh Lord, come on down 
 Let your Holy Ghost, let your anointing 
 Let your Shekinah Glory, let it fall down 
 On me, On me, On me, On me 
 Let it fall down 
 Lord let it fall down 
 I need you Lord to let your 
 Spirit fall down 
 On me

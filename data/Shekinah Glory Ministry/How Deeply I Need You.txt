Here is my heart, I give it lord to you 
 Here is my life, I lay it before you 
 Where else would I go? 
 What else would I do? 
 If I did not know you? 
 How deeply I need you 
 How deeply I need you, my lord 
 How deeply I need you, my lord 
 Like the desert needs the rain, I need you 
 Like the ocean needs the streams, I need you 
 Like the morning needs the sun, I need you 
 Lord you are my only one 
 In every way, and every day 
 I need you

What kind of love would bear my sins 
 Redeem my soul from all of them 
 To call an enemy a friend 
 This love I cannot comprehend 
 Jesus did it all for me 
 Yes, He's the one of whom I speak 
 His sacrifice was oh, so great 
 His mission was to save 
 He died on Calvary 
 (Just for me) 
 Yes, He took my penalty 
 (He did it all for me, me) 
 He rose again with power 
 He's alive this very hour 
 He's coming back to reign upon His throne 
 Listen to the Master's call 
 Come to Him and give your all 
 No matter what you may have done 
 Forgiveness is for everyone 
 In Jesus Christ you can be free 
 And live with Him eternally 
 Your Lord and Savior He will be 
 If you will just believe

 (Lead ad-lib) 
 Just for me 
 Just for me 
 Just for me 
 He did it all for me, me 
 Just for me 
 Just for me 
 Just for me 
 He did it all for me, me 
 Just for me 
 Just for me 
 He rose again with power 
 He's alive this very hour 
 He's coming back to reign upon His throne 
 (Choir over and over, with Lead ad-lib)

Praise is what I do 
 When I want to be close to you 
 I lift my hands in praise 
 Praise is who I am 
 I will praise him while I can 
 I'll bless, him at, all times 
 And I vow to praise you 
 Through the good and the bad 
 I'll praise you 
 Whether happy or sad 
 I'll praise you 
 In all that I go through 
 Because praise is what I do 
 'Cause I owe it all to you 
 Praise is what I do 
 Even when I'm going through 
 I've learned to worship you 
 Know my circumstance 
 Doesn't even stand a chance 
 My praise outweighs the bad 
 And I vow to praise you 
 Through the good and the bad 
 I'll praise you 
 Rather happy or sad 
 I'll praise you 
 In all that I go through 
 Because praise is what I do 
 'Cause I owe it all to you 
 Praise is what I do 
 Is what I do

Will your heart and soul say yes 
 Will your Spirit still say yes 
 There is more that I require of thee 
 Will your heart and soul say yes 
 Now will your heart and soul say yes 
 Will your Spirit still say yes 
 If I told you what I really need 
 Will your heart and soul say yes 
 Open up your heart and tell the Lord Yes 
 Say yes, yeah yeah 
 Say I'll obey Jesus, I won't stray Jesus 
 But this time I've made up in my mind, I've made up in my mind 
 I'll say, say say yes 
 My soul says yes, my mind says, my heart says yes, yes, yes I will Jesus 
 Yes, Yes 
 I'll do what you want me to do 
 I'll say what you want me to say 
 I'll go, if you lead me, if you lead me 
 If you lead me, if you lead me, if you lead me I'll go yes 
 Lift your hands and tell the Lord 
 Come on open up your heart and say yes, yes, yes 
 ALL God wants is yes, all God wants, all God wants, all God wants is yes 
 I won't be afraid 
 I'll step out on your word 
 I'll declare your glory 
 Yes I will, Yes I will 
 I wanna do your will Jesus 
 I wanna do your will, I wanna do your will 
 My soul says yes, yes, yes, yes 
 (Background the whole song) 
 Yes (repeat) 
 There is more that I require of thee (repeat) 
 My soul says Yes

Come over me O Lord 
 Set me free 
 By Your grace I am renewed 
 Come over me 
 Through a burning bush and dreams 
 You've worked miracles it seems 
 Just so Your people could speak to You and 
 You split that temple sheet that separated You and me 
 Just so I could speak to You 
 So I raise my head and hands up high 
 And cry out to the sky 
 Come over me O Lord 
 Set me free 
 By Your grace I am renewed 
 Come over me 
 You calmed the lions in the den 
 And with Your voice You ceased the winds 
 Let Peter walk the sea to get to You and 
 Raised Lazarus from the dead and hung Yourself instead 
 On a wooden cross so I could get to You 
 So I raise my head and hands up high 
 And cry out to the sky 
 Come over me O Lord 
 Set me free 
 By Your grace I am renewed 
 Come over me 
 Come over me O Lord 
 Set me free 
 By Your grace I am renewed 
 Come over me

I call to You 
 Come quickly to me 
 Hear my voice when I cry 
 May my prayer rise to You 
 May my prayer rise to You 
 I call to You 
 Come quickly to me 
 Hear my voice when I cry 
 May my prayer rise to You 
 May my prayer rise to You 
 I cry aloud to the Lord, oh 
 I lift my voice 
 For the Lord has mercy 
 When my spirit grows faint in me 
 Let a righteous man strike me 
 It is a kindness, oh 
 Let a righteous man rebuke me 
 It's oil on my head 
 May my prayer rise to You 
 May my prayer rise to You 
 I cry aloud to the Lord, oh 
 I lift my voice 
 For the Lord has mercy 
 When my spirit grows faint in me 
 I cry aloud to the Lord, oh 
 I lift my voice 
 For the Lord has mercy 
 When my spirit grows faint, oh 
 For the Lord has mercy 
 When my spirit grows faint in me 
 For the Lord has mercy, yeah 
 Have mercy on me

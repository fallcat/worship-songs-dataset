Slippin my feet in the shallow end of this pool 
 I don't wanna go much deeper for this fear that I may drown 
 But I've heard that You can walk on water 
 And if You hold my hand maybe I can walk with You 
 Maybe I can walk with You 
 Cloud my vision with this confidence You've given me 
 Cause I don't want to depend on these hazel eyes 
 Lord, I know You can see much farther 
 And if You hold my hand maybe I can walk with You 
 Maybe I can walk with You 
 I've been wishing in this dried up, empty well 
 Cause this town has already had it's fill 
 And as I wonder if there's any left for me 
 Your living water is already covering 
 Already covering me 
 Let my hand keep this pen from writing 
 The words I know You have given me to share 
 But I fear that I won't say it clearly enough 
 But don't You let me lay this pen down 
 Or shut my mouth, don't let me shut my mouth 
 I've been wishing in this dried up, empty well 
 Cause this town has already had it's fill 
 And as I wonder if there's any left for me 
 Your living water is already covering 
 Already covering me 
 I've been wishing in this dried up, empty well 
 Cause this town has already had it's fill 
 As I wonder if there's any left for me 
 Your living water is already covering 
 Already covering me 
 I've been wishing in this dried up, empty well 
 Cause this town has already had it's fill 
 And as I wonder if there's any left for me 
 Your living water is already covering 
 Already covering me

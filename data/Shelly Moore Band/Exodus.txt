Breathing in this desert air 
 Grumbling voices fill my ears 
 A month of freedom in my head 
 I thought it would be different here 
 Though in bondage I was full, I wanted to be free 
 Yet here I am in need of You 
 Lord come provide for me 
 I am here 
 Wipe away your tears 
 I am here 
 I will provide, I will provide 
 With My bread of life 
 I will provide, I will provide 
 I am here 
 This evening I think of the land 
 That I was freed from once again 
 But this time I know 
 I will see Your glory in the morning 
 I am here 
 Wipe away your tears 
 I am here 
 I will provide, I will provide 
 With My bread of life 
 I will provide, I will provide 
 As the dew is lifted from the ground 
 Revealing bread of heaven for Your child 
 Oh, I find that there's enough to meet my needs 
 But to gather it up isn't easy 
 I am here 
 Wipe away your tears 
 I am here 
 I will provide, I will provide 
 I am Your bread of life 
 I will provide, I will provide 
 I am here

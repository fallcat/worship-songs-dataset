Lord teach me, teach me what it means to be free 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means 
 Fill me like Steven, so I'm ready to go 
 And follow Your lead even unto the stones 
 Change me like Paul - remove the stones from my hand 
 Blind me with Your glory so I can see Your plan 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means to be free 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means 
 To feel the chains around my feet all released 
 Call me like Peter - take this stone in Your hand 
 Shape me into holiness 'til I'm all that I am 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means to be free, yeah 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means 
 To feel the chains around my feet 
 Oh and I may not know true freedom 
 'Til I'm safe in heaven's gates 
 And I may not feel the peace that I long for in this place 
 But I have a hope that Your plan will interlace 
 My sin and shame - Your cross and fame 
 All for Your name's sake 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means to be free 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means, yeah 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means to be free, yeah 
 Lord teach me, teach me what it means 
 To feel the chains around my feet all released

In this moment I feel 
 Lord You want to reveal 
 More of You and more of Your perfect plan 
 But Lord You are so big 
 And my mind is so small 
 Thank You for Your patience as I try to understand 
 All of Your ways and all of Your grace 
 You offer me more joy and hope 
 Than I can comprehend 
 I'm down on my face 
 You've put me in my place 
 Don't let this moment fade 
 Lord You are holy, Lord You are holy 
 I can hear Your voice 
 Calling out louder as I hush my own 
 Be still my child and know that I am God 
 I'm down on my face 
 You've put me in my place 
 Keep me here I pray 
 Lord You are holy, Lord You are holy 
 Lord make me holy 
 I'm down on my face 
 You've put me in my place 
 Don't let this moment fade 
 Lord You are holy, Lord You are holy 
 Lord make me holy 
 Lord You are holy, Lord You are holy 
 Lord make me holy 
 Lord You are holy, Lord You are holy 
 Lord make me holy

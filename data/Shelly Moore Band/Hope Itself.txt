Hope itself will never stay if not laid somewhere to rest 
 And faith will tear your heart away if it's set within your chest 
 And love will never lead you home if you think it's already gone 
 Already gone and left you here crying all your tears 
 Embracing all your fears 
 There aren't enough days to waste not even one 
 For all that should be done 
 There aren't enough people in the world to explain this universe 
 In words I can understand 
 But there's not much I can do but share these thoughts with you 
 And I guess we'll wait and see where things go from there. 
 But in the meantime I'm still here to wipe away your tears 
 And to help you face your fears 
 Hope itself will never stay if not laid somewhere to rest 
 And faith will tear your heart away if it's set within your chest 
 And love will never lead you home if you think it's already gone

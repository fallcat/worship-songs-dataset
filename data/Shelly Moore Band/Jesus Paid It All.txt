I hear the Savior say, 
 "Thy strength indeed is small, 
 Child of weakness, watch and pray, 
 Find in me thine all in all" 
 Lord, now indeed I find 
 Thy power and Thine alone, 
 Can change the leper's spots 
 And melt the heart of stone. 
 Jesus paid it all 
 All to Him I owe 
 Sin had left a crimson stain 
 But He washed it white as snow 
 He washed it white as snow 
 For nothing good have I 
 Whereby Thy grace to claim; 
 I'll wash my garments white 
 In the blood of Calvary's Lamb 
 Jesus paid it all 
 All to Him I owe 
 Sin had left a crimson stain 
 But He washed it white as snow 
 He washed it white as snow 
 And when, before the throne, 
 I stand in Him complete, 
 "Jesus died to save my soul," 
 My lips shall still repeat. 
 Jesus paid it all 
 All to Him I owe 
 Sin had left a crimson stain 
 But He washed it white as snow 
 Jesus paid it all 
 All to Him I owe 
 Sin had left a crimson stain 
 But He washed it white as snow 
 He washed it white as snow

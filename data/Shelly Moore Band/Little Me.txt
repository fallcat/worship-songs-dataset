So low to this earth, I'm just 5'4" above the ground 
 Do You surround me here 
 I bow my head to pray, and look to the sky to seek Your face 
 Do You surround me here 
 Come down from Your holy place 
 Past heaven's gates 
 Be near this little me 
 Come down from Your holy place 
 Past heaven's gates 
 Be near this little me 
 Surround me here 
 Surround me here 
 I have turned my eyes blind to You and cried 
 Do You surround me here 
 Do You still sympathize while I wail and whine 
 Do You surround me here 
 Come down from Your holy place 
 Past heaven's gates 
 Be near this little me, oh, oh 
 Come down from Your holy place 
 Past heaven's gates 
 Be near this little me 
 Blood fell from Your head, and wrists and feet and side 
 All pierced for me 
 When I cry not remembering Your great sacrifice 
 Do I pull a tear from Your eye? 
 You came down from Your holy place 
 Past heaven's gates 
 To be near this little me, yeah 
 You came down from Your holy place 
 Past heaven's gates 
 To be near this little me, oh, oh 
 Come down from Your holy place 
 Past heaven's gates 
 Be near this little me

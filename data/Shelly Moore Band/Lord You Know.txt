Lord, You are my Father 
 And You are my King 
 Lord, You are my Holy Savior 
 You're perfect in all Your ways 
 When I stand 
 I will stand for You 
 When I fall to my knees 
 I will worship and praise You 
 I want nothing more than to be 
 Like You 
 Lord, You know I falter 
 But You lift me up 
 I could shout for joy until 
 My lungs cave in 
 But still I can't shout loud enough 
 When I stand 
 I will stand for You 
 When I fall to my knees 
 I will worship and praise You 
 I want nothing more than to be 
 Like You are 
 So help me stand when I stand for You 
 And let me fall to my knees when I worship and praise You 
 I want nothing more than to be 
 Lord, I want nothing more than to be 
 I want more than to be like You

Sadly I serenade my room's barren walls 
 Knowing no one will hear 
 My desperate, desperate call 
 All the listeners have 
 Moved on along 
 But my sonnet is heard 
 My sonnet is heard 
 Gently now 
 He speaks my name 
 So soft and subtle 
 And it will not change 
 It's up to me to heed His call 
 So He can carry me 
 Quietly He listens to me 
 Allowing me to be 
 The creature He has made 
 And steadily He guides my path 
 Holding no love back 
 So I sing to Him my praise 
 Gently now 
 He speaks my name 
 So soft and subtle 
 And it will not change 
 It's up to me to heed His call 
 So He can carry me 
 Memories of my indwelling heart 
 Pull my focus from Your throne 
 Speak to me clearly above the fray 
 So I can hear Your precious tone 
 Gently now 
 You speak my name 
 So soft and subtle 
 It's up to me to heed Your call 
 So You can carry me, carry me 
 Gently now 
 You speak my name 
 So soft and subtle 
 And You will not change 
 It's up to me to heed Your call 
 So You can carry me, carry me 
 Carry me 
 Carry me 
 Carry me 
 Carry me

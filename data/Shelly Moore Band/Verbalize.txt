I lay awake at night 
 And I dream of what I hope someday to be 
 Don't want to leave Your will to follow my own fantasies 
 I know I've given You my life 
 And Lord I know that You are wise 
 So I trust beyond this trial 
 I will be all right 
 And I can't describe Your love 
 I can't verbalize Your grace 
 So all that I can say 
 Is that I love You Jesus 
 I can't describe Your love 
 I can't verbalize Your grace 
 So all that I can say is that I love You, You 
 You lift the sun up high and set the dew upon the ground 
 What more could I ask of You 
 Oh, I know You're all around 
 For one You parted a sea and even now 
 Lord I know You'd do the same for me 
 I can't describe Your love 
 I can't verbalize Your grace 
 So all that I can say 
 Is that I love You Jesus 
 I can't describe Your love 
 I can't verbalize Your grace 
 So all that I can say is that I love You 
 Why do You do the things You do 
 I could never suffer through without You 
 There's never any doubt that You are near 
 I'm so glad You would not leave me here alone 
 I can't describe Your love 
 I can't verbalize Your grace 
 So all that I can say 
 Is that I love You Jesus 
 I can't describe Your love 
 I can't verbalize Your grace 
 So all that I can say is that I love You, You

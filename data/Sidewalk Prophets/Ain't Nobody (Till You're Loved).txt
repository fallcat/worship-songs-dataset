"I was just a young boy" my Father said to me, 
 "There are three things in this life that you should be: 
 Be respectful, be grateful, and above all else 
 Be the love, just be the love" 
 'Cause you ain't nobody 
 Till you love somebody 
 So go on, go out 
 And give your heart away 
 'Cause you ain't nobody 
 Until you're love 
 Just remember 
 You're always, always love 
 Walkin' down a sidewalk, I heard a prophet say 
 That money is the opposite of love 
 The more love that you give away 
 The richer you become 
 So gather up your love 
 And spend it all 
 'Cause you ain't nobody 
 Till you love somebody 
 So go on, go out 
 And give your heart away 
 'Cause you ain't nobody 
 Until you're love 
 Just remember 
 You're always, always love 
 Yes, you are 
 Ha 
 Du-du-du-du-du-du-du 
 Whoo-ooh-ooh 
 You're always, always, always love 
 Oh, yeah 
 Du-du-du-du-du-du-du 
 Whoo-hoo-hoo 
 You're always, always, always love 
 I've climbed up on a mountaintop 
 Sat beside the sea 
 No matter where I climb I set my sails 
 I realize under starry skies 
 From my head down to my toes 
 I'm covered by Your love that never fails 
 'Cause you ain't nobody 
 Till you love somebody 
 So go on, go out 
 Give your heart away 
 'Cause you ain't nobody 
 Until you're love 
 Just remember 
 You're always, always love 
 Love is patient, love is kind 
 It is always by your side 
 Just remember 
 You're always, always love 
 One, two, three

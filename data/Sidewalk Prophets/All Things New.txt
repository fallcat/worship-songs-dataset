There's a place deep inside of me 
 No one else has ever seen 
 And I fight to keep the light 
 From reaching the darkness within me 
 I've been holding onto secrets 
 That I can never tell 
 'Cause if I did, then you'd know 
 That I was really someone else 
 Can you forgive, will you forget 
 All these wrongs and make me whole again 
 You restore the broken, You heal the sinner's heart 
 You make all things new, all things new 
 On the cross Your love was spoken, You even wore the scars 
 To make all things new, all things new 
 You have carried all the pain 
 So heavy on my soul 
 Lift me up, and hold me close 
 You will never let me go 
 I should have know the walls I built 
 Were never strong enough 
 To keep You, from reaching me 
 Nothing's greater than Your love 
 Can you forgive, will You forget 
 All these wrongs and make me whole again 
 You restore the broken, You heal the sinner's heart 
 You make all things new, all things new 
 On the cross Your love was spoken, You even wore the scars 
 To make all things new, all things new 
 You release the chains 
 Of all my yesterdays 
 And I am not the same, Lord 
 I am not the same 
 You restore the broken, You heal the sinner's heart 
 You make all things new, all things new 
 On the cross Your love was spoken, You even wore the scars 
 To make all things new, all things new 
 From the beginning till the end of time 
 You love will never change 
 You make all things new, all things new 
 From the sand upon the shoreline 
 To the stars up in the sky 
 You make all things new, all things new 
 Behind the Song: 
 "All Things New is a love song to God proclaiming his beauty and the amazing way he takes the darkest, ugliest parts of our hearts and washes them clean once again. His beauty is overwhelming, so much so that darkness stands no chance. Even the scars that Christ suffered on the cross became a radiant, gorgeous testament to His love for all of us sinners. When a man can overcome the destruction of crucifixion and His scars can become a beautiful reminder of our sins erased, He truly is the Savior of the world. "From beginning to the end of time... from the sand upon the shoreline to the stars up in the sky," our God is a beautiful God, constantly renewing and loving the hearts and lives of His people." - Sidewalk Prophets

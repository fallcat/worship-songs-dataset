The snow is falling again 
 It looks a wonderland 
 But I'm stuck in traffic behind all these red lights 
 So I call you up and sigh 
 'Cause I forgot the pumpkin pie 
 You say "it's all right; 
 We'll still have a wonderful night 
 Just take your time and slow it down 
 And let your heart hear the joyful sounds" 
 Because it's Christmas 
 Love is filling the air 
 Because it's Christmas 
 The thrill of hope is everywhere 
 So let the music play 
 And let your worry melt away 
 Because it's Christmas 
 Back home the fire's bright 
 And the tree is full of lights 
 But the family's coming and there's so much work to be done 
 So you call me up and say 
 Could you hurry on your way 
 I say "hold on, tonight will be so much fun 
 Just take a breath, and say a prayer 
 And before you know it I'll be there" 
 Because it's Christmas 
 Love is filling the air 
 Because it's Christmas 
 The thrill of hope is everywhere 
 So let the music play 
 And let your worry melt away 
 Because it's Christmas 
 And in this world so loud and busy 
 Sometimes we forget just why 
 We celebrate this time each year 
 But if you listen close the angels cry 
 The whole world sings the reason why 
 Because it's Christmas 
 Our savior's born tonight 
 Because it's Christmas... 
 Because it's Christmas 
 Love is filling the air 
 Because it's Christmas 
 The thrill of hope is everywhere 
 So let the music play 
 And let your worry melt away 
 Because it's Christmas

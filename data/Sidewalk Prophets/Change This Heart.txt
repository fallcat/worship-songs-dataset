I've been trying to run away from this false reality 
 No matter where I turn my back your always right in front of me 
 And so I push you away but I don't know that I'm wrong 
 And I don't know the words to say to make my faith that strong 
 So I will pray to you right now 
 To take away my sin 
 And heal away my brokenness 
 And change this heart again 
 Without you I am nothing 
 But a weak and dying man 
 And so I will pray to you right now 
 Change this heart again 
 What is going through the motions 
 If my life is still the same 
 And everyday's the same ole puzzle 
 With all the pieces re-arranged 
 But I refuse your help 
 Out of my own selfish pride 
 Lord I have so many misses 
 To cover up and hide 
 Now I will pray to you right now 
 To take away my sin 
 Heal away my brokenness 
 And change this heart again 
 Without you I am nothing 
 But a weak and dying man 
 So I will pray to you right now 
 Change this heart again 
 So I will pray to you right now 
 To take away my sin 
 Come and heal away my brokenness 
 Change this heart again 
 Because without you I am nothing 
 But a weak and dying man 
 So I will pray to you right now 
 Change this heart again 
 So I will pray to you right now 
 To change this heart again, again 
 So I will pray to you sweet lord 
 And change this heart again

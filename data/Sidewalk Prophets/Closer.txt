I've been tired and weary 
 Heading back home 
 Never thought it'd be so hard 
 Walking the narrow road 
 Through all the toils and trials 
 Lord You never left me 
 So I'm finally closer, closer 
 To where I wanna be 
 A man's got a worth 
 But the problem has been 
 I spent my whole life working 
 Instead of taking Your hand 
 Lord won't You burn away 
 All that keeps You from me 
 I want You here closer, closer than anything 
 So take me to the center of the fire 
 Take me to the middle of the sea 
 Take me through the darkest of nights 
 You can be the lamp to my feet 
 Walk me over mountains and valleys 
 Till I'm only hanging by Your prayer 
 If it brings me closer, closer 
 You can take me anywhere 
 What I know about fire 
 You use it to refine my heart 
 What I know about the ocean 
 When You tell it to part it parts 
 Even though the darkest of nights 
 It draws me to my knees 
 And it brings me closer, closer 
 When I hear You speak 
 So take me to the center of the fire 
 Take me to the middle of the sea 
 Take me through the darkest of nights 
 You can be the lamp to my feet 
 Walk me over mountains and valleys 
 Till I'm only hanging by Your prayer 
 If it brings me closer, closer 
 You can take me anywhere 
 There once lived a man 
 Who loved his enemies 
 The whole world mocked and laughed 
 'Cause of what they couldn't see 
 He was ... 
 On the truth that sets us free 
 He said the poor shall be blessed 
 And that's what I wanna be 
 Take me to the center of the fire 
 Take me to the middle of the sea 
 Take me through the darkest of nights 
 You can be the lamp to my feet 
 Walk me over mountains and valleys 
 Till I'm only hanging by Your prayer 
 If it brings me closer, closer 
 You can take me anywhere 
 Blessed are the broken 
 Blessed are the weak 
 Blessed are the hungry and thirsty 
 Blessed are those that seek 
 Blessed are the lonely 
 For they will have a love to spare 
 Blessed are the poor in spirit 
 Lord Your kingdom is there 
 If it brings me closer, closer 
 Take me anywhere 
 Wanna be closer 
 Gotta be closer 
 We want You closer Lord 
 We need You closer, closer Lord 
 We want You closer Lord 
 How we need You closer, closer Lord 
 We want You closer 
 We need You closer 
 Bring us closer, closer Lord 
 We want you closer 
 We need You closer 
 Lord bring us closer, closer Lord 
 Bring us closer 
 Bring us closer 
 Bring us closer, closer than we'll ever be 
 Bring us here closer, closer, closer 
 We need You, Lord we need You 
 Yeah we need You hear closer, closer 
 We want You hear closer, closer 
 Bring us closer, closer 
 Bring us closer, Lord 
 Bring us closer 
 Bring us closer 
 Closer, closer, closer, closer 
 Beyond the fear that follows near 
 Till thorn through darkness that appears 
 Like sun and moon and sands of time 
 Something different starts to shine 
 A flash of faith within the soul 
 Like little hands it digs a hole 
 Not to bury but to bring new life, new breath, new song to sing 
 Fast to find it forever know 
 To glimpse to grasp to change and grow 
 This moment does not linger long 
 Before tomorrow breaks the dawn 
 The gold will fade and embers die 
 Something different will arise

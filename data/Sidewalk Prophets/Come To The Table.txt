We all start on the outside 
 The outside looking in 
 This is where grace begins 
 We were hungry, we were thirsty 
 With nothing left to give 
 Oh the shape that we were in 
 Just when all hope seemed lost 
 Love opened the door for us 
 He said come to the table 
 Come join the sinners who have been redeemed 
 Take your place beside the Savior 
 Sit down and be set free 
 Come to the table 
 Come meet this mightly crew of misfits 
 These liars and these thieves 
 There's no one unwelcome here 
 So that sin and shame that you brought with you 
 You can leave it at the door 
 Let mercy draw you near 
 Come to the table 
 Come join the sinners who have been redeemed 
 Take your place beside the Savior 
 Sit down and be set free 
 Come to the table 
 Come to the table 
 To the thief and to the doubter 
 To the hero and the coward 
 To the prisoner and the soldier 
 To the young and to the older 
 All who hunger, all who thirst 
 All the last and all the first 
 All the poppers and the princess 
 All who fail you've been forgiven 
 All who dream and all who suffer 
 All who loved and lost another 
 All the chained and all the free 
 All who follow, all who lead 
 Anyone who's been let down 
 All the lost you have been found 
 All who have been labeled right or wrong 
 To everyone who hears this song 
 Ooh 
 Come to the table 
 Come join the sinners you have been redeemed 
 Take your place beside the Savior 
 Sit down and be set free 
 Ooh 
 Sit down and be set free 
 Come to the table 
 Come to the table 
 Just sit down and rest a while 
 Just sit down and rest a while 
 Come to the table

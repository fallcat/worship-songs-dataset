Stars exploding in the wake of your love 
 Galaxies all turn their heads 
 The skies are gazing on their one creator 
 Universe in awe 
 You sit in throne above the earth's great circle 
 Mountains reach for you 
 The ocean waves hum a lullaby 
 Whole wide world in awe 
 Can't help but be still 
 In know you are God 
 I marvel at you 
 My eyes catch a glimpse of every sunset 
 You trace dreams upon my mind 
 My skin and bones can feel your touch 
 I shiver 
 Heart and soul in awe 
 Can't help but be still 
 In know you are God 
 I marvel at you 
 Frozen in my steps 
 Like a child in wonder 
 When I see you move 
 Everything in awe 
 Everything in awe 
 Everything in awe 
 Everything in awe 
 Stars exploding in the wake of your love 
 Galaxies all turn their heads 
 The skies are gazing on their one creator 
 Universe in awe 
 Whole wide world in awe 
 Heart and soul in awe 
 Everything in awe 
 Everything in awe 
 Everything in awe 
 Everything in awe

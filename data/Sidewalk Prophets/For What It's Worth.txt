For what it's worth 
 I'll give all that I have 
 Without ever looking back I'll follow you 
 For what it's worth 
 I will offer up my life 
 As living proof of what Your love can do 
 I will run and not grow weary, I will walk and not be faint 
 I can't sing loud enough 
 I could never earn Your love 
 I'm just a glimpse of the hope You see in me 
 Hold my heart in Your hands 
 Jesus, help me understand 
 I can only give my life, for what it's worth 
 For what it's worth 
 I am standing here amazed 
 By the wonders that Your mighty hands have made 
 I don't deserve 
 To be covered by Your grace 
 So with every breath the least that I can say 
 I will run and not grow weary, I will walk and not be faint 
 I can't sing loud enough 
 I could never earn Your love 
 I'm just a glimpse of the hope You see in me 
 Hold my heart in Your hands 
 Jesus, help me understand 
 I can only give my life, for what it's worth 
 I will give my all to You my king 
 There is nothing more that you ask of me 
 I will lift will lift my voice, and I will sing 
 There is nothing more that I can give a king 
 I will lift my voice, I will lift my voice 
 I can't sing loud enough 
 I could never earn Your love 
 I'm just a glimpse of the hope You see in me 
 Hold my heart in Your hands 
 Jesus, help me understand 
 I can only give my life, for what it's worth 
 I can only give my life, for what it's worth 
 Behind the Song: 
 "For What It's Worth is a phrase that has always meant a small amount. When we hear piece of advice prefaced by the phrase "for what it's worth," our minds are usually preparing for a throw-away suggestion. This song tries to reverse this logic. In the verses, we are giving God our all but don't necessarily believe that our lives are worthy. We can never measure up to the grace, beauty, joy, etc. of our amazing God. All we can do is give our life in dedication to our King. The beauty is that our lives are precious and priceless to Christ. Though we "can't sing loud enough", and we are just a "glimpse of the hope" He sees in us, we can give Him the perfect gift, our lives, for what it's worth." - Sidewalk Prophets

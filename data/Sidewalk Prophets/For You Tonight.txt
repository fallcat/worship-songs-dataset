You think you're alone 
 But you're not alone 
 You carry the blame 
 Like it's your own 
 Time to say goodbye to all the fear 
 Don't you know that I am right here 
 My heart beats 
 For You tonight 
 We all need 
 Someone on our side 
 There is a hope 
 With arms open wide 
 For you tonight 
 You can't separate 
 The You from me 
 This is the way 
 It was made to be 
 I'll be reaching out forever, so 
 Take my hand, just let the rest go 
 My heart beats 
 For You tonight 
 We all need 
 Someone on our side 
 There is a hope 
 With arms open wide 
 For you tonight 
 Whatever you go through 
 Know I'll never leave you 
 'Cause we're held together 
 By love that this world can't divide

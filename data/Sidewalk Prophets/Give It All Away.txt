I've held on for all this time 
 To something that was never mine 
 I've kept Your love like there was none to spare 
 I've heard the call and seen the need 
 But I've been lost in apathy 
 When did I get to comfortable to care? 
 The world is crying out 
 So hungry for a change 
 Lord, let us be the ones to say 
 Take my heart 
 Lord I pray 
 That I can give it all away 
 Let me give it all away 
 'Cause I long to feel compassion 
 For a world that needs Your grace 
 Take my heart 
 I want to give it all away 
 You have filled this empty soul 
 With mercy that has overflowed 
 The way You give to me seems so unfair 
 So here is my life it's all for the one 
 Who gave it all in the name of love 
 Now this hope You give to me 
 I've got to share 
 The world is crying out 
 So hungry for a change 
 Lord, let us be the ones to say 
 Take my heart 
 Lord, I pray 
 That I can give it all away 
 Let me give it all away 
 'Cause I long to feel compassion 
 For a world that needs Your grace 
 Take my heart 
 I want to give it all away 
 Let us be the change 
 Let us be Your light 
 Let us be Your hope 
 And let us give it all away 
 Let us be the change 
 Let us be Your light 
 Let us be Your hope 
 I want to give it all... 
 So, take my heart 
 Lord, I pray 
 That I can give it all away 
 Let me give it all away 
 'Cause I long to feel compassion 
 For a world that needs Your grace 
 Take my heart 
 I want to give it all away 
 Take my heart 
 I want to give it all away 
 Take my heart 
 I want to give... 
 I've held on for all this time 
 To something that was never mine 
 Behind the Song: 
 "Give It All Away calls for us to share everything in the name of Christ. The song begins and ends with the line, "I've held on for all this time, to something that was never mine." We often feel that we have to desperately keep all that God has provided, whether it is money or even love. We long to help and do what is right, but fear often blinds us to the struggles of those that surround us. I have long believed that the opposite of love was not hate but, rather, fear. We are so scared by the unknown, and hate is just a version of that fear. "Give It All Away" is our prayer for the strength to overcome the fear and simply give what Christ has called us to give, everything. "Take my heart. I want to give it all away!"" - Sidewalk Prophets

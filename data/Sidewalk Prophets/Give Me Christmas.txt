Get out of bed 
 Outside the window there's nothing but snow 
 Run down the stairs 
 The smile in my heart has spread down to my toes 
 Heaven knows 
 Ribbons of red 
 Presents as far as the eye can see 
 In this wonderland 
 The tree is a tower of gold and green 
 What a wonderful scene 
 All the lights and the toys 
 Bring us joy 
 In the end, it's just not enough 
 'Cause what we really need 
 And what Christmas really means is love 
 Give me Christmas, give me Christmas 
 The table is set 
 A house full of friends and family 
 The fire is warm 
 We'll be singing those songs and laughing all night long 
 Cause there's one thing we all can agree 
 All the lights and the toys 
 Bring us joy 
 In the end, it's just not enough 
 'Cause what we really need 
 And what Christmas really means is love 
 Give me Christmas, give me Christmas 
 Gather round the tree 
 And remember what Christmas really means 
 All the cookies and candy 
 The carols and candles 
 The stockings and the snow 
 All the tinsel and trimmings 
 And the lights are all twinkling 
 The world is all aglow 
 All of these things are so wonderful beautiful 
 But what we really need is love 
 Give me Christmas 
 Give me Christmas

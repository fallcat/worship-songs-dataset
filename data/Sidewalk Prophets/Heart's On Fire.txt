I want to see Your face 
 As clear as the midnight stars 
 I want to feel Your love 
 Like a train running through my heart 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 Louder than a cannon blast 
 I want to chase after You 
 Never, ever looking back 
 Maker of All 
 I want to know You 
 You are the flame 
 My heart's on fire 
 Just like the sun 
 Tears through the darkness 
 I'm burning for You 
 My heart's on fire 
 I want to write to You 
 My story for a King 
 I want to play for You 
 My greatest symphony 
 I want to sing to You 
 The song of souls set free 
 I want to live for You 
 Just like You died for me 
 Maker of All 
 I want to know You 
 You are the flame 
 My heart's on fire 
 Just like the sun 
 Tears through the darkness 
 I'm burning for You 
 My heart's on fire 
 Yes, it is 
 Into Your ocean 
 Into the flood 
 I want to fall so deep in Your love 
 Into Your ocean 
 Into the flood 
 I want to fall so deep in Your love 
 I want to know You 
 You are the flame 
 My heart's on fire 
 Just like the sun 
 Tears through the darkness 
 I'm burning for You 
 My heart's on fire 
 I'm burning for you 
 My heart's on fire

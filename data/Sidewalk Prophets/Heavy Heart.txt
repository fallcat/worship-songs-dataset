It never really was your intention 
 To let the chains of anger grow so strong 
 Now all you can feel is the tension 
 Between the struggle to be right and the emptiness of wrong 
 There's no need to fight 
 I pray the truth will set you free tonight 
 Don't let the sun set on your heavy heart 
 Forgiveness can find you wherever you are 
 Let go of your pride and step out from the dark 
 Don't let the sun set on your heavy heart 
 It wasn't just a single decision 
 One lie lead to another one 
 Life is feeling like a collision 
 Between the wall of lies and a bullet train of love 
 Just let it fall 
 I promise you that love will come and heal it all 
 Don't let the sun set on your heavy heart 
 Forgiveness can find you wherever you are 
 Let go of your pride and step out from the dark 
 Don't let the sun set on your heavy heart 
 This is the day that you've been given 
 This is about a new beginning 
 Look up and see the sunrise 
 Look up and watch the day light come 
 Don't let the sun set on your heavy heart 
 Let go of your pride and step out from the dark 
 Don't let the sun set on your heavy heart 
 Don't let the sun set on your heavy heart

I don't know where to go from here 
 It all used to seem so clear 
 I'm finding I can't do this on my own 
 I don't know where to go from here 
 As long as I know that You are near 
 I'm done fighting 
 I'm finally letting go 
 I will trust in You 
 You've never failed before 
 I will trust in You 
 If there's a road I should walk 
 Help me find it 
 If I need to be still 
 Give me peace for the moment 
 Whatever Your will 
 Whatever Your will 
 Can you help me find it 
 Can you help me find it 
 I'm giving You fear and You give faith 
 I giving you doubt 
 You give me grace 
 For every step I've never been alone 
 Even when it hurts, You'll have Your way 
 Even in the valley I will say 
 With every breath 
 You've never let me go 
 I will wait for You 
 You've never failed before 
 I will wait for You 
 If there's a road I should walk 
 Help me find it 
 If I need to be still 
 Give me peace for the moment 
 Whatever Your will 
 Whatever Your will 
 Can you help me find it 
 Can you help me find it 
 I lift my empty hands (come fill me up again) 
 Have Your way my King (I give my all to You) 
 I lift my eyes again (Was blind but now I see) 
 'Cause You are all I need 
 If there's a road I should walk 
 Help me find it 
 If I need to be still 
 Give me peace for the moment 
 Whatever Your will 
 Whatever Your will 
 Can you help me find it 
 Can you help me find it

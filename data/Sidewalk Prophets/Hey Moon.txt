Hey, hey moon 
 It's funny how time just flies 
 Yesterday we were just kids 
 Hanging in the sky 
 Staying up all night 
 Hey, hey moon 
 Do you ever get tear in your eye? 
 When you think about the time that God came down 
 I couldn't help myself 
 I had to shine so bright 
 I remember that newborn baby? 
 And the wise men that traveled so far 
 That's when I knew I was made for a reason 
 I feel like the luckiest star 
 Hey moon 
 Hey, hey moon 
 It's funny how things have changed 
 I wish they could see the things we've seen 
 Before the colored lights 
 And Christmas trees 
 Hey, hey moon 
 So many people are searching for signs 
 God is stirring in their hearts 
 They will lift their wandering eyes 
 And see us shine 
 Then they'll remember that newborn baby? 
 And the wise men that traveled so far 
 Then they'll that they were made for a reason 
 I feel like the luckiest star 
 Hey moon... 
 Silent night, 
 Holy night 
 All is calm 
 All is bright

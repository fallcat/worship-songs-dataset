Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 It's the best time of the year 
 I don't know if there'll be snow 
 But have a cup of cheer 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And when you walk down the street 
 Say hello to friends you know 
 And everyone you meet 
 Oh oh the mistletoe 
 Hung where you can see 
 Somebody waits for you 
 Kiss him once for me 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And in case you didn't hear 
 Uh by golly have a holly jolly 
 Christmas this year 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 It's the best time of the year 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And when you walk down the street 
 Say hello to friends you know 
 And everyone you meet 
 Oh oh the mistletoe 
 Hung where you can see 
 Somebody waits for you 
 Kiss him once for me 
 Have a holly jolly Christmas 
 And in case you didn't hear 
 Uh by golly have a holly jolly 
 Christmas this year

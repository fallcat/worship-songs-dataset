All the leaves on these autumn trees 
 They set the grey sky on fire 
 Naked branches are left behind 
 And the whispering winds leave me tired 
 They blow colder than bones upon my feet 
 As I slowly shuffle home 
 I shuffle on 
 This path is so narrow 
 Shadows on every side 
 Feels like loneliness roams 
 With me down the road 
 He's become a friend of mine 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find a way back to you 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find a way 
 A way back 
 This window wasn't made quite right 
 The light has to fight to come through 
 When it does, it's all faded and worn 
 But it carries me closer to you 
 I'm broken again, brought down to my knees 
 By a grace that covers me 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find a way back to you 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find a way 
 A way back 
 And I'm deeply aware that I'm deeply loved 
 By a love I could never deserve 
 And until the day comes when I'm finally home 
 I will ramble and wonder and search 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find my way back to you 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find a way 
 Trying to find a way 
 Way, way, way back 
 Trying to find a way back 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find a way back to you 
 I'm a homeless heart 
 Trying to find a way 
 A way back to you

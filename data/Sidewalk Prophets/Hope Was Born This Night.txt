Tonight I can see a star shine 
 And its splendor fills up the sky 
 It's the same that appeared and the wise men revered 
 When hope was born this night 
 Out upon the snowy fields 
 There's a silent peace that heals 
 And it echoes the grace of our Savior's embrace 
 Because hope was born this night 
 Glory to God in the highest 
 Peace on Earth, goodwill toward men 
 Let all of the world sing the chorus of joy 
 Because hope was born this night 
 I can hear the Christmas bells ring 
 As softly a church choir sings 
 It's the song used to praise the Ancient of Days 
 When hope was born this night 
 There are angels in this place 
 And my heart resounded the praise 
 Like a shepherd so scared, I'll rejoice and declare 
 That hope was born this night 
 Glory to God in the highest 
 Peace on Earth, goodwill toward men 
 Let all of the world sing the chorus of joy 
 Because hope was born this night 
 Gloria, Gloria 
 Gloria, Gloria 
 Gloria 
 Oh Gloria, Gloria 
 Oh Gloria 
 Gloria, Gloria 
 Glory to the God in the highest 
 Peace on Earth, goodwill toward men 
 Let all of the world sing the chorus of joy 
 Because hope was born this night 
 Glory to God in the highest 
 Peace on Earth, goodwill toward men 
 Let all of the world sing the chorus of joy 
 Because hope was born this night 
 I know hope was born this night 
 Because Christ was born this night

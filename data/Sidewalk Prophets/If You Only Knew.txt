If you only knew 
 But I've got secrets that I hide 
 If you only knew 
 But I've got so much fear inside 
 If you only knew 
 But I can't find out were to go 
 If you only knew 
 But God I just don't know 
 I'm not sure that I can handle all this on my own 
 I'm not sure that I can just give in and let it go 
 If you only knew that I am with you every moment 
 If you only knew that you are never alone 
 If you only knew that plans that I have for you 
 And the way that I have told you 
 Don't you know that you're my own if you only knew 
 But I already know 
 What about my doubt 
 All you need's a little faith 
 What about what I deserve 
 Well that's the beauty of my grace 
 What about my debt 
 I've already paid the cost 
 What about my sin 
 It's up there nailed to the cross 
 You were never meant to handle this on your own 
 Just give me everything you have inside 
 And let it go 
 If you only knew that I am with you every moment 
 If you only knew that you are never alone 
 If you only knew that plans that I have for you 
 And the way that I have told you 
 Don't you know that you're my own if you only knew 
 If you only knew 
 But I already know 
 Oh, my God I long to know you more and more each day 
 Oh, my child pray and speak I am never far away 
 Oh, my God please take my life 
 And make it look more like you 
 Oh, my child you are my joy I'm so in love with you 
 If you only knew 
 If you only knew 
 If you only knew 
 If you only knew that I am with you every moment 
 If you only knew that you are never alone 
 If you only knew that plans that I have for you 
 And the way that I have told you 
 Don't you know that you're my own if you only knew 
 If you only knew 
 How much I love you 
 How much I love you 
 If you only knew

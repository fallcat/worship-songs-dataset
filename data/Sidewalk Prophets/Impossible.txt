They tell me that I can't 
 Tell me that I won't 
 Tell me that I'm washed up 
 Tell me that I'm broke 
 They tell me that I don't 
 Don't have what it takes 
 Tell me that I'm crazy 
 Hanging on by faith 
 Tell me I'm a lost cause 
 I'm a hopeless soul 
 Just stand back watch my God do 
 The impossible, the impossible 
 Everything is possible 
 With him everything is possible, is possible 
 Everything is possible 
 Everything is possible 
 Precious God you bring life from death 
 With your word all of time began 
 Is possible, the impossible 
 Everything is possible 
 Watch our God do the impossible 
 Some would say it's foolish 
 Stepping on the ways 
 Some would say it's over 
 When you're buried in the grave 
 We're calling all the dreamers 
 With passion in their eyes 
 Calling all believers out into the light 
 Even when it's hopeless 
 Out of our control 
 Just let go, watch our God do 
 The impossible, the impossible 
 Everything is possible 
 With him everything is possible, is possible 
 Everything is possible 
 Everything is possible 
 Precious God you bring life from death 
 With your word all of time began 
 Is possible, the impossible 
 Everything is possible 
 Watch our God do the impossible 
 When our God speaks 
 The mountains roar 
 The whole earth trembles with the throne 
 Though this life can be 
 His glorious break enlights the sun 
 When our hope is lost 
 When our strength is gone 
 He is rising up 
 We will overcome 
 The impossible, the impossible 
 Everything is possible 
 With him everything is possible, is possible 
 Everything is possible 
 Everything is possible 
 Precious God you bring life from death 
 With your word all of time began 
 Is possible, the impossible 
 Everything is possible 
 Watch our God do the impossible 
 When our hope is lost 
 When our strength is gone 
 He is rising up 
 We will overcome

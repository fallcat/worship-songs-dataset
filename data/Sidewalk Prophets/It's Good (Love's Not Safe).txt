Dark clouds gather 'round 
 There's every reason to back down 
 Your excuses are running out 
 But now's no time to leave 
 Just tryin' to walk the line 
 It's not enough to get by 
 All it does is keep you blind 
 But if you truly want to see 
 Turn and face the wind 
 Let the storm begin 
 Love's not safe at all 
 Love might let you fall 
 Love's not easy 
 But it's good, it's good, it's good 
 Love will take your time 
 Love might feel unkind 
 Love will break you 
 But it's good, it's good, it's good 
 Oh it's good 
 It's ok to start again 
 You've got to lose to win 
 And right where the end begins 
 That's where you find yourself 
 Losing all control 
 Finally letting go 
 Love's not safe at all 
 Love might let you fall 
 Love's not easy 
 But it's good, it's good, it's good 
 Love will take your time 
 Love might feel unkind 
 Love will break you 
 But it's good, it's good, it's good 
 I know it's good 
 Anything good in life's 
 Gonna take a sacrifice 
 Don't let up when it's tough 
 Don't ever give up the fight [x3] 
 Everything you need in life 
 Was given by his sacrifice 
 I will give it all to you 
 I will give it all to Christ 
 He's not safe at all 
 He might let you fall 
 He's not easy 
 But He's good 
 I know He's good 
 He will take your time 
 He might feel unkind 
 He will break you 
 But He's good, He's good, He's good 
 I know He's good 
 He's good, He's good, He's good 
 He's good, He's good, He's good 
 I know He's good 
 He's good, He's good, He's good 
 I know He's good 
 He's good, He's good, He's good 
 He's good

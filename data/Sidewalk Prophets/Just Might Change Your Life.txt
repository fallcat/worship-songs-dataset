You've got your reasons 
 Reasons just to walk away 
 No one would blame you if you didn't want to face the pain 
 You find yourself 
 Up against the wall 
 You're scared to push cause it might fall 
 And it... 
 Just might change your life 
 You're on the edge now take one step 
 And you just might find you'll fly 
 You never know what will happen next 
 Don't be afraid to let go this time 
 It just might change your life 
 You keep on reaching 
 Reaching for a hand to hold 
 You're scared you'll wake up on the edge of the unknown You find your heart in fragile place 
 Afraid to move cause it might break 
 And it... 
 Just might change your life 
 You're on the edge now take one step 
 And you just might find you'll fly 
 You never know what will happen next 
 Don't be afraid to let go this time 
 It just might change your life 
 Don't be afraid to let go 
 Just let go, just let go, just let go, just let go! 
 And it... 
 Just might change your life 
 You're on the edge now take one step 
 And you just might find you'll fly 
 You never know what will happen next 
 And it just might change your life 
 You're on the edge now take one step 
 And you just might find you'll fly 
 You never know what will happen next 
 Don't be afraid to let go this time 
 Don't be afraid to let go this time 
 It just might change your life 
 Behind the Song: 
 "Just Might Change Your Life is a song about not being comfortable. It was inspired by watching students on a camping trip cliff-diving. What a scary place to be, on the edge of the world, but the leap of faith, overcoming the fear, and the journey that follows is such a beautiful reward. I believe that God never called us to feel contented in our Christianity. We are supposed to live on the edge and take His message to all corners of the world. So often, we get so comfortable within our own skin that we forget that we were made to share God's love. Though it is scary to live a life of relentless faith, the journey is amazing. "Just let go and it just might change your life." If you give God the chance to use you, you just might be amazed where He takes you and the way He uses you to change the lives of others." - Sidewalk Prophets

Make me broken - so I can be healed 
 'Cause I'm so calloused and now I can't feel 
 I want to run to You 
 With heart wide open 
 Make me broken 
 Make me empty - so I can be filled 
 'Cause I'm still holding onto my will 
 And I'm completed 
 When You are with me 
 Make me empty 
 Till You are my one desire 
 Till You are my one true love 
 Till You are my breath, my everything 
 Lord, please keep making me 
 Make me lonely - so I can be whole 
 Till I want no one more than You, Lord 
 'Cause in the darkness, I know you will hold me 
 Make me lonely 
 Till You are my one desire 
 Till You are my one true love 
 Till You are my breath, my everything 
 Lord, please keep making me 
 Till You are my one desire 
 Till You are my one true love 
 Till You are my breath, my everything 
 Lord, please keep making - 
 I know you'll keep making - 
 Lord, please keep making me.

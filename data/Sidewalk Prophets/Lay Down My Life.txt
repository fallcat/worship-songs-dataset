All your pain 
 Will be made mine 
 All your troubles 
 The tears you cry 
 Give it up 
 All that binds 
 I will place it on my shoulders 
 And up this hill I'll climb 
 Father, give me strength 
 I know there is no other way 
 I lay down my life for you 
 This is the moment when all will be made new 
 I know that you don't understand 
 But this is part of a greater plan 
 So I lay down my life for you 
 This is love 
 That had to bleed 
 To bring you mercy 
 To set you free 
 You are mine 
 I am yours 
 And I will wear your burdens 
 Just like this crown of thorns 
 I will take your place 
 I know there is no other way 
 I lay down my life for you 
 This is the moment when all will be made new 
 I know that you don't understand 
 But this is part of a greater plan 
 And I lay down my life for you 
 Give me all your pride 
 Give me all your fears 
 Give me all your secrets 
 Give me all your tears 
 Give me all you doubt 
 Give me all your shame 
 Watch them wash away 
 Watch them wash away 
 Give me all your pride 
 Give me all your fears 
 Give me all your secrets 
 Give me all your tears 
 Give me all you doubt 
 Give me all your shame 
 Watch them wash away 
 In Jesus' name 
 I lay down my life for you 
 This is the moment when all will be made new 
 I know that you don't understand 
 But this is part of a greater plan 
 And I lay down my life for you 
 Though I know that you don't understand 
 These scars are part of a greater plan 
 And I lay down my life for you 
 Arms stretched out 
 Upon this tree 
 To show true love 
 To set you free 
 Behind the Song: 
 "Lay Down My Life is written from the perspective of Christ, and set in the time period right before He carries the cross up the hill of Calvary to be crucified. Christ knew there was no other way, but suffered immeasurable pain, all for us. "You are mine, I am yours, and I will wear your burdens just like this crown of thorns." I have always thought of the cross as the most beautiful tragedy in the history of time. That a perfect innocent man would be so savagely destroyed for us, and yet He loved us enough to set us free from the burden of sin." - Sidewalk Prophets

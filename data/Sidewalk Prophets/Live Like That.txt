Sometimes I think: 
 What will people say of me, 
 When I'm only just a memory? 
 When I'm home where my soul belongs? 
 Was I love when no one else would show up? 
 Was I Jesus to the least of us? 
 Was my worship more than just a song? 
 I want to live like that 
 And give it all I have 
 So that everything I say and do points to You 
 If love is who I am, then this is where I'll stand 
 Recklessly abandoned, never to hold it back 
 I want to live like that 
 I want to live like that 
 Am I proof that You are who You say You are? 
 That grace can really change a heart? 
 Do I live like Your love is true? 
 People pass, and even if they don't know my name 
 Is there evidence that I've been changed? 
 When they see me do they see You? 
 I want to show the world the love You gave for me 
 I'm longing for the world to know the glory of the King

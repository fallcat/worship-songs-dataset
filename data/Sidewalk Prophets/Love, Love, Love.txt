It goes deeper than just religion 
 Realer that reality television 
 Truer than the pages of a fairytale 
 It'll happily ever never fail 
 It's better than your good intentions 
 A lot more honest than a politician 
 It's worth more than the money in your pocket 
 It won't back down, no one can stop it 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 Goes that far 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 So love love love 
 With all your heart 
 You can find it where the children play 
 It's in the coffee shops and the alley ways 
 You can see it in the stars above 
 And when you think you can't, you can with love 
 So take it out to the weak and lonely 
 Take it out to the outcasts too 
 Give it away to the tired weary 
 When you give it away, it comes back to you 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 Goes that far 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 So love love love 
 With all your heart 
 Read about a man who came in to this world 
 Loving every man, woman, boy and girl 
 Hung out with some folks that would make you stare 
 Saying come as you are, you're welcome here 
 Spent His life with the least of these 
 Died on a cross between two thieves 
 And on the third day the stone rolled away 
 He beat back death so we could say 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 Goes that far 
 Love love love 
 Love love love 
 So love love love 
 With all your heart 
 It's a great big hug for all those haters 
 Even broke through the dark side of Darth Vader 
 It's like the air we breathe, we all need it 
 Oh, yeah 
 Even Chuck Norris can't defeat it

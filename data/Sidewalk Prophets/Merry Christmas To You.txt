Snowballs flying through the air 
 Crashed my sled but I don't care 
 Nothing in this world could make me blue 
 Snowmen out on the front lawn 
 Lift their hands and sing along 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 Grandpa snores loud as choir 
 Stockings hung above the fire 
 You got socks and I got a kazoo 
 Cookies baking in the stove 
 Let's go hang out by the mistletoe 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 Christmas only comes but once a year 
 The happiest of days is finally here 
 So come on sing it out 
 Let's give love that's true 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 I hear a noise up the roof 
 Might be the sound of reindeer hoofs 
 The kids all know, I know it's you know who 
 Above it all the angels sing 
 Glory, glory to the King 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 Christmas only comes but once a year 
 The happiest of days is finally here 
 So come on sing it out 
 Let's give love that's true 
 Merry Christmas to you 
 Christmas only comes but once a year 
 The happiest of days is finally here 
 Jesus, you were born 
 And gave us love that's true 
 Merry Christmas to you

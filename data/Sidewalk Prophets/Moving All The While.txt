In the morning as I wake 
 I pray my eyes do see 
 On this narrow road I walk 
 You have made a path for me 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 You were moving all the while 
 In sickness and in doubt 
 Or questions that may raise 
 You claimed victory on the cross 
 And You filled my lungs with praise 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 You were moving all the while 
 On a dark and silent night 
 Above Your beauty shines 
 And Your peace shall fill the earth 
 By Your love we are refined 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 You were moving all the while 
 Through all the bitter storms 
 Whatever comes our way 
 You will guide this vessel home 
 To live for all my days 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 You were moving all the while 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 You were moving all the while 
 You were moving all the while 
 Behind the Song: 
 "Moving All the While is a modern hymn and praise song. Each verse is a different season, a different time in life and yet God is ever-present and always moving. The chorus is overly simple for a reason, there is no other word like "hallelujah." Wherever I am in life, from the lowest of lows to the edge of pure joy, the word "hallelujah" is my declaration. The word hallelujah is used throughout the Psalms and it translates as "praise God". From our first words to the end of time, hallelujah will be our cry. "Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a large crowd, like the sound of raging waters, and like the sound of powerful thunderclaps, saying, "Hallelujah! The Lord our God, the Almighty, is reigning" (Revelation 19:6)." - Sidewalk Prophets

Every journey needs a first step to start 
 Every fire grows from a single spark 
 A great symphony begins with just one note 
 One voice can give the whole world hope 
 There's no impossible, nothing we can't face 
 The tallest mountains are moved by a seed of faith 
 Come together, don't you know that you're not alone 
 We will rise up 
 For the kingdom come 
 Lay down our lives 
 For the sake of love 
 If God's with us 
 We know that 
 Nothing's gonna stop us 
 Nothing's gonna stop us 
 He has called you, to all the places you'll go 
 He's the author of every dream that you hold 
 Come together, don't you know that the time is now 
 The time is now 
 We will, rise up 
 For the kingdom come 
 Lay down, our lives 
 For the sake of love 
 If God's with us 
 We know that 
 Nothing's gonna stop us 
 No height, no depth 
 Could ever keep us from the love of God, I know, I know 
 No life, no death 
 Could ever separate us from the love of God, I'm sure

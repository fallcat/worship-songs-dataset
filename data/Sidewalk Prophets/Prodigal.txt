It's been a long time since you felt peace 
 In the valley you made where you're not meant to be 
 Where the shame throws shadows on you 
 But don't you forget 
 That you're headed to more 
 But you've settled for less 
 Don't buy the lie it's as good as it gets 
 The same feet that left you lost and alone 
 Are the very same feet that can bring you back home 
 Wherever you are, whatever you did 
 It's a page in your book, but it isn't the end 
 Your Father will meet you with arms open wide 
 This is where your heart belongs 
 Come running like a prodigal 
 There will be nights, when you hear whispers 
 Of the life you once knew, don't let it linger 
 Cause there's a grace that falls upon you 
 Don't you forget 
 In the places your weak 
 He is very strong 
 Don't ever believe you don't deserve love 
 The same God that protects you when you're lost and alone 
 Is the very same God that is calling you home 
 Wherever you are, whatever you did 
 It's a page in your book, but it isn't the end 
 Your Father will meet you with arms open wide 
 This is where your heart belongs 
 Come running like a prodigal 
 Oh... 
 Let your life be made new 
 Oh... 
 As you come into view 
 Your Father's not waiting, no he's running too 
 He's running straight to you 
 Wherever you are, whatever you did 
 It's a page in your book, but it isn't the end 
 Your Father will meet you with arms open wide 
 This is where your heart belongs 
 Come running like a prodigal

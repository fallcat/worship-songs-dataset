We met half a dozen times 
 I know your name; I know you don't know mine 
 But I won't hold that against you 
 You come here every Friday night 
 I take your order; I try to be polite 
 And hide what I've been going through 
 If you looked me right in the eye 
 Would you see the pain deep inside? 
 Would you take the time? 
 Tell me what I need to hear 
 Tell me that I'm not forgotten 
 Show me there's a God who can be 
 More than all I've ever wanted 
 'Cause right now, I need a little hope 
 I need to know that I'm not alone 
 Maybe God is calling you tonight 
 To tell me something that might save my life 
 I'm the pastor at your church 
 For all these years you've listened to my words 
 You think I know all the answers 
 But I've got doubts and questions too 
 Behind this smile, I'm really just like you 
 Afraid and tired and insecure 
 If you looked me right in the eye 
 Would you see the real me inside? 
 Would you take the time to... 
 Tell me what I need to hear 
 Tell me that I'm not forgotten 
 Show me there's a God who can be 
 More than all I've ever wanted 
 'Cause right now, I need a little hope 
 I need to know that I'm not alone 
 Maybe God is calling you tonight 
 To tell me something that might save my life 
 I am just like everyone 
 Jesus, I need You; I need Your love 
 To save my life 
 Tell me what I need to hear 
 Tell me that I'm not forgotten 
 Show me You're the God who can be 
 More than all I've ever wanted 
 'Cause right now, I need a little hope 
 I need to know that I'm not alone 
 I can hear You calling me tonight 
 Oh, I know that You are calling me tonight 
 Jesus, only You can save my life 
 Save my life

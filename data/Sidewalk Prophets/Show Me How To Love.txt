Passed by you today 
 Why is there a war between us? 
 Are you not my brother? 
 Are you not my sister? 
 Something's got to change 
 Stood by you today 
 Why is there a wall between us? 
 Are you not my sister? 
 Are you not my brother? 
 Well something's got to change 
 I confess that I've been blind 
 Open up this heart of mine 
 Show me how to love 
 Farther than this world I know 
 Take me where You want me to go 
 Show me how to love 
 I know the times are always changing 
 But our hearts still beat the same 
 We have a Father 
 We have a Savior 
 And that will never change 
 I confess that I've been blind 
 Open up this heart of mine 
 Show me how to love 
 Farther than this world I know 
 Take me where You want me to go 
 Show me how to love 
 We are one heart beating 
 We are one body breathing 
 We are broken and needing 
 The same love of the Father 
 I confess that I've been blind 
 I confess, start with me, Lord 
 Behind the Song: 
 "So often we walk through life unaware of the lives and stories of those that surround us. "Show Me How to Love" takes an honest approach declaring that "something has to change," that something is our portrayal of God's love. Simple and to the point, we are all brothers and sisters in Christ, and we sometimes lose sight and need God to show us once again how to truly love." - Sidewalk Prophets

Silent night, Holy night 
 All is calm, all is bright 
 Round young virgin, mother and child 
 Holy infant so, tender and mild 
 Sleep in heavenly peace, 
 Sleep in heavenly peace! 
 Silent night, Holy night 
 Shepherds quake, at the sight 
 Glories streams from heaven above 
 Heavenly hosts sings Hallelujah 
 Christ the savior is born, 
 Christ the savior is born! 
 Silent night, Holy night 
 Son of God, love's pure light 
 Radiant beams from thy holy face 
 With the dawn of redeeming grace, 
 Jesus, Lord at thy birth, 
 Jesus, Lord at thy birth!

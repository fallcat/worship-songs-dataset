Sun up, gonna work like a little tin soldier 
 Marchin' to your own beat, the world on your shoulders 
 We all struggle and we're not alone 
 You try and you try, but you never have to do it on your own, no 
 And I believe, yes I believe 
 We're all a part of a family 
 And nothing in this world could come between 
 'Cause we are, we are, we are 
 We are, we are, we are 
 Sisters and brothers 
 Needin' each other 
 Father, help us see 
 That we are, we are, we are 
 Together with one heart 
 Sisters and brothers 
 Needin' each other 
 We are 
 So what, who cares? 
 We're all a bit different 
 Shout it out, celebrate 
 What we've been given 
 The world can tell us that we don't belong, but 
 Sing together, it's a beautiful, beautiful song 
 And I believe, yes I believe 
 We're all a part of a family 
 And nothing in this world could come between 
 'Cause we are, we are, we are 
 We are, we are, we are 
 Sisters and brothers 
 Needin' each other 
 Father, help us see 
 That we are, we are, we are 
 Together with one heart 
 Sisters and brothers 
 Needin' each other 
 We are 
 Because of His love, we'll never live alone 
 Because of His love, our lives will overflow 
 Beautifully broken, we are the redeemed 
 Made to share the love of the coming King 
 We are, we are, we are 
 We are, we are, we are 
 Sisters and brothers 
 Needin' each other 
 We are, we are, we are 
 (We are, we are, we are) 
 Together with one heart 
 (Together with one heart) 
 Sisters and brothers 
 Needin' each other 
 We are 
 We are

Oh, our soles 
 They travel all these miles 
 Over mountains they go 
 Through the valleys below 
 Just trying to get back home 
 And oh, our souls 
 Are fighting everyday 
 There is no safe place 
 But unmerited grace 
 And a Savior that calls us His own 
 When the night pours in 
 And the stars grow dark 
 We will not give up 
 We will find the spark 
 Through the wounded hearts 
 Through our eyes are blind 
 We fight to make it home 
 And lift this battle cry 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We will soar on wings like eagles 
 And rise in the name of love 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We gotta carry on 
 Though the journey's long 
 Still our faith is strong 
 Let it rise in the name of love 
 Soldier on 
 Oh, our hearts 
 Can tear our fear with peace 
 When we want to turn back 
 In the heat of attack 
 There's a courage that will not cease 
 Oh, our strength 
 It grows from the spirit within 
 And our enemy shakes 
 'Cause we've won the day 
 Before it even begins 
 So we raise our flag 
 And we charge that hill 
 As the bullets fly 
 As time stands still 
 No, we cannot lose 
 'Cause our death is gain 
 We fight to stand beside 
 The King of Kings 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We will soar on wings like eagles 
 And rise in the name of love 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We gotta carry on 
 Though the journey's long 
 Still our faith is strong 
 Let it rise in the name of love 
 I can do all things through Him 
 Through Him who strengthens me 
 Through Him I can do all things 
 Through Him I can do all things 
 I can do all things through Him 
 Through Him who strengthens me 
 Through Him I can do all things 
 Through Him I can do all things 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We gotta soldier on 
 We will soar on wings like eagles 
 And rise in the name of love 
 Soldier on 
 We gotta carry on 
 Though the journey's long 
 Still our faith is strong 
 Let it rise in the name of love 
 Soldier on 
 Yeah

When we walk down the street 
 It'd be to a whole 'nother beat 
 And you would see 
 A Light in you and me 
 Maybe a remedy 
 Some kinda relief 
 And they'd be like 
 Ooh ah, look at 'em go 
 Whata they know that I don't know 
 Ooh ah every move we make 
 Don't ya know that we can 
 Help see 'em saved 
 There's something different 
 Something different 
 And I gotta have it 
 I can't describe it 
 Can't describe it 
 But I know that I need it 
 I don't know what it is 
 But I need a dose of it 
 C'mon c'mon c'mon 
 Can ya feel it 
 There's something different 
 Yeah we got that spark 
 It's a break from the dark 
 So real so right 
 And they be like 
 I think I need it in my life 
 Ooh ah 
 Stop them guys! 
 Whata you have that I don't have 
 Ooh I would do it differently 
 But ya know that we can help 
 See 'em saved 
 There's something different 
 Something different 
 And I gotta have it 
 I can't describe it 
 Can't describe it 
 But I know that I need it 
 I don't know what it is 
 But I need a dose of it 
 C'mon c'mon c'mon 
 Can ya feel it 
 There's something different 
 I'ma tell you what it is 
 I'm about to tell you what it is 
 I'm about to tell you what it is 
 It's a love like you've never known 
 It's a feeling like being home 
 It's always knowing that you're never alone 
 It's a shock to your sleeping soul 
 It's a love like you've never known 
 It's a feeling like being home 
 It's always knowing that you're never alone 
 It's Jesus Christ and He's in my soul 
 There's something different 
 Something different 
 Yeah 
 There's something different 
 Something different 
 And you gotta have it 
 You can't describe it 
 Can't describe it 
 But I know that you need it 
 I know just what it is 
 And you need a dose of it 
 C'mon c'mon c'mon 
 You can feel it 
 You need that something different 
 I'ma tell you what it is 
 I'ma tell you what it is 
 Jesus Christ is something different

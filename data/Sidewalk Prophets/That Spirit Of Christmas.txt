Christmas is the time of year 
 For being with the one's we love 
 Sharing so much joy and cheer 
 What a wonderful feelin' 
 Watching the one's we love 
 Having so much fun 
 I was sittin' by the fire side 
 Taking a walk through the snow 
 Listening to a children's choir 
 Singing songs about Jesus 
 The blessed way that he came to us 
 Why can't it remain 
 All through the year 
 Each day the same 
 Hey yeah, that's what I wanna hear 
 Heh heh 
 It's truly amazin' 
 That spirit of Christmas 
 All the kin folk gather round 
 The lovely Christmas tree 
 Hearts are glowing full of joy 
 Sense the gifts that we're giving 
 And the love that we're living 
 Why can't it remain 
 Oh all through the year 
 Each day the same 
 Hey yeah, that's what I wanna hear 
 I'll tell ya 
 It's truly amazin' 
 That spirit of Christmas 
 Let me hear ya 
 Why can't it remain 
 All through the year 
 Each day the same 
 That's what I wanna hear 
 Listen to me 
 It's truly amazin' 
 That spirit of Christmas 
 Oh It's truly amazin' 
 That spirit of Christmas 
 Ain't it so 
 It's truly amazin' 
 Yeah, that spirit of Christmas 
 Oh Christmas 
 Oh Christmas

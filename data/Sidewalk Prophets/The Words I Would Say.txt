Three in the morning, 
 And I'm still awake, 
 So I picked up a pen and a page, 
 And I started writing, 
 Just what I'd say, 
 If we were face to face, 
 I'd tell you just what you mean to me, 
 I'd tell you these simple truths, 
 Be strong in the Lord and, 
 Never give up hope, 
 You're going to do great things, 
 I already know, 
 God's got His hand on you so, 
 Don't live life in fear, 
 Forgive and forget, 
 But don't forget why you're here, 
 Take your time and pray, 
 These are the words I would say, 
 Last time we spoke, 
 You said you were hurting, 
 And I felt your pain in my heart, 
 I want to tell you, 
 That I keep on praying, 
 Love will find you where you are, 
 I know 'cause I've already been there, 
 So please hear these simple truths, 
 Be strong in the Lord and, 
 Never give up hope, 
 You're going to do great things, 
 I already know, 
 God's got His hand on you so, 
 Don't live life in fear, 
 Forgive and forget, 
 But don't forget why you're here, 
 Take your time and pray, 
 These are the words I would say, 
 From one simple life to another, 
 I will say, 
 Come find peace in the Father, 
 Be strong in the Lord and, 
 Never give up hope, 
 You're going to do great things, 
 I already know, 
 God's got His hand on you so, 
 Don't live life in fear, 
 Forgive and forget, 
 But don't forget why you're here, 
 Take your time and pray, 
 Thank God for each day, 
 His love will find a way, 
 These are the words I would say

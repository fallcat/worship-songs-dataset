I can see it in your eyes that you are restless 
 The time has come for you to leave 
 It's so hard to let you go but in this life I know 
 You have to be who you were made to be 
 As you step out on the road I'll say a prayer 
 So that in my heart you always will be there 
 This is not goodbye 
 I know we'll meet again 
 So let your life begin 
 'Cause this is not goodbye 
 It's just "I love you" to take with you 
 Until you're home again 
 The stirring in your soul has left you wondering 
 Should you stay or turn around 
 Well, just remember that your dreams they are a promise 
 That you were made to change the world 
 So don't let fear stop you now 'cause 
 This is not goodbye 
 I know we'll meet again 
 So let your life begin 
 'Cause this is not goodbye 
 It's just "I love you" to take with you 
 Until you're home again 
 I know the brightest star above 
 Was created by the One who loved 
 More than we'll ever know 
 To guide you when you're lost 
 What started as a still, small voice 
 Is raging now and your only choice 
 Is to follow who you are 
 So follow who you are 'cause 
 This is not goodbye 
 I know we'll meet again 
 Oh 
 This is not goodbye 
 I know we'll meet again 
 So let your life begin 
 'Cause this is not goodbye 
 It's just "I love you" to take with you 
 Until you're home again

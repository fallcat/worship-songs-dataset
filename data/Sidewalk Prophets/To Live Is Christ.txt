If I rise, let me rise on you 
 Not on all of my successes, my sting or my pursuits 
 If I lose, let me lose my life 
 'Cause if I belong to Jesus, the flesh is crucified 
 For me to live is Christ 
 For me to live is Christ 
 For me to live is Christ, to die is gain 
 If I grow, let me grow in You 
 Wilt the seeds of wanting more 
 Ripped and pried out by the roots 
 And if I'm still, let me hear You speak 
 Not the tone of my transgressions 
 But the song of the Redeemed 
 For me to live is Christ 
 For me to live is Christ 
 For me to live is Christ, to die is gain 
 For me to live is Christ 
 For me to live is Christ 
 For me to live is Christ, to die is gain 
 My great desire is to be with You 
 But this is the place you chose for me 
 This is the place you chose for me 
 To lift my cross and give everything 
 This is the time you gave to me 
 This is the time you gave to me 
 For me to live is Christ, For me to live is Christ 
 For me to live is Christ, to die is gain 
 I'll never be the same, I'll never be the same 
 For me to live is Christ, to die is gain

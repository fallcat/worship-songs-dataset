The shepherds came to 
 See the baby 
 Stood by his mother's side 
 Here laid the Savior 
 Inside a manger 
 Oh what a glorious night 
 Oh what a glorious night 
 I hear the angels singing halleluiah 
 Let the earth receive her king 
 I know that love has come 
 Singing it out 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 Yeah 
 The shepherds wondered 
 They couldn't hide it 
 Told everyone in sight 
 All were amazed 
 When they heard how 
 God came down on the glorious night 
 God came down on this glorious night 
 I hear the angels singing halleluiah 
 Let the earth receive her king 
 I know that love has come 
 Singing it out 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 Yeah 
 Glorious 
 Glorious 
 What a Glorious night 
 Glorious 
 Glorious 
 What a Glorious night 
 I hear the angels singing halleluiah 
 Let the earth receive her king 
 I know that love has come 
 Singing it out 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 I hear the angels singing halleluiah 
 Let the earth receive her king 
 I know that love has come 
 Singing it out 
 Jesus Christ is born 
 I heard that Jesus Christ is born 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 All is calm now 
 All is quiet 
 A Star shining in the sky 
 Below in Bethlehem 
 The king is sleeping 
 Oh What a Glorious Night 
 Oh What a Glorious Night

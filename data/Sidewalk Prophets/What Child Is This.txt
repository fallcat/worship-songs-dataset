What child is this 
 Who lay to rest 
 On Mary's lap is sleeping 
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet 
 While shepherds watch are keeping 
 So bring him incense, gold and myrrh 
 Come peasant king to own him 
 The King of Kings salvation brings 
 Let loving hearts enthrone him 
 This, this is Christ the King 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
 Haste, haste to bring him laud 
 The Babe, the Son of Mary 
 What child is this 
 Who lay to rest 
 On Mary's lap is sleeping 
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet 
 While shepherds watch are keeping 
 This, this is Christ the King 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing 
 Haste, haste to bring him laud 
 The Babe, the Son of Mary 
 Raise, raise a song on high 
 The virgin sings her lullaby 
 Joy, joy for Christ is born 
 The Babe, the son of Mary

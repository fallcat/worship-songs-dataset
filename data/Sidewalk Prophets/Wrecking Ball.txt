Father, Father 
 I need to rip out this old tree 
 Father, Father 
 The roots of lust and greed 
 Have grown so deep into this ground 
 I've tried so hard to pull them out 
 On my own, they take the best of me 
 I need a wrecking ball 
 Slamming inside my heart 
 Breaking me all apart 
 Tearing the old away 
 Killing the fear in me 
 Until I can finally breathe 
 Even if it hurts so bad that I can't even stand 
 Take it all, let me fall into Your hands 
 Father, Father 
 You have brought me to my knees 
 Father, Father 
 You long for me to see 
 When I get lost along the path 
 You will fight to bring me back 
 Only You, can make the best of me 
 Hands where mercy lives where grace begins 
 With Your hands knock down all these walls I'm praying 
 I need a wrecking ball 
 Slamming inside my heart 
 Breaking me all apart 
 Tearing the old away 
 Killing the fear in me 
 Until I can finally breathe 
 Even if it hurts so bad that I can't even stand 
 Take it all, break it all, Take my all 
 Let me fall into Your hands 
 Father, Father 
 I need to rip out this old tree

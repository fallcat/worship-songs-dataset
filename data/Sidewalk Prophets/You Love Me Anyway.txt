The question was raised 
 As my conscience fell 
 A silly, little lie 
 It didn't mean much 
 But it lingers still 
 In the corners of my mind 
 Still you call me to walk 
 On the edge of this world 
 To spread my dreams and fly 
 But the future's so far 
 My heart is so frail 
 I think I'd rather stay inside 
 But You love me anyway 
 It's like nothing in life that I've ever known 
 You love me anyway 
 Oh Lord, how You love me 
 How You love me 
 It took more than my strength 
 To simply be still 
 To seek but never find 
 All the reasons we change 
 The reasons I doubt 
 And why do loved ones have to die? 
 But You love me anyway 
 It's like nothing in life that I've ever known 
 You love me anyway 
 Oh Lord, how You love me 
 I am the thorn in Your crown 
 But You love me anyway 
 I am the sweat from Your brow 
 But You love me anyway 
 I am the nail in Your wrist 
 But You love me anyway 
 I am Judas' kiss 
 But You love me anyway 
 See now, I am the man that called out from the crowd 
 For Your blood to be spilled on this earth shaking ground 
 Yes then, I turned away with this smile on my face 
 With this sin in my heart tried to bury Your grace 
 And then alone in the night, I still called out for You 
 So ashamed of my life, my life, my life 
 But You love me anyway 
 Oh, God... how you love me 
 You love me anyway 
 It's like nothing in life that I've ever known 
 You love me anyway 
 Oh Lord, how You love me 
 You love me, You love me 
 You love me, You love me 
 How You love me 
 How You love me 
 How You love me 
 Behind the Song: 
 "You Love Me Anyway is a song that embodies what the band is all about, loving God despite our fears and questions, and loving him because He first loved us. We wrote this song in the basement of Ben's house in the middle of a thunderstorm, I remember thinking how incredibly safe I felt. The storm raged all around and shook the walls, but safe inside we sat. That's just like our God, a shelter in the storm. I then started to remember all the things I had done not to deserve such a shelter, such a loving God. I remembered being a child and telling my very first lie. It was about the death of a goldfish. 
 When I was 4, I just thought that a goldfish needed a chance to breathe the air, to get out a little, and that he must be tired of swimming all the time. So, I reached my little hand in the tank and set him free. He wiggled and flailed for a while but then finally stopped and slept. I felt that I had really helped that fish out, and that knowledge felt great, until... 
 My babysitter had a radar for tragic things, things like pushing another child or falling and scraping your hand on the pavement. When that fish stopped moving, her radar kicked into overdrive. She flew out of the kitchen, looked me directly in the eyes, and asked, "who killed Morty?" My mind was distraught. I had never meant to kill anything, ever, not even a roly-poly worm. In such distress, I did the only thing that came natural. See I was a good boy, and I knew my bible verses. So, I puffed out my chest, looked my babysitter directly in the eye, mustered up all my courage, and then quickly pointed at my friend Joel and yelled, "He did it!" And for some reason, a reason that to this day I can't explain, Joel admitted that he did the deed. He took the bullet. Then, he stood in the corner for a mind numbing 30 minutes. As I watched cartoons that afternoon, I couldn't concentrate. I remember glancing back at Joel and every second that I glanced was guiltier than the last. 
 The following Sunday, I sat in a pew up in the balcony at church with my Mom. I cried and desperately tried to hide the tears, but Moms can always tell when something is amiss. They have a knack for understanding puffy eyes and tear soaked sleeves. "What is wrong?" was all she needed to say to open up my heart. "I hurt you. I hurt Jesus," I cried. Then I told her the whole dramatic story, and that I really wasn't trying to kill anything at all, and that I was so, so sorry. I will never forget the lesson I learned that day. It was on this occasion that my mother explained to me the power of Jesus' death on the cross and the amazing grace that covered the world's sins. It was because of His blood I could experience true unconditional love and forgiveness for the first time. 
 It was there in that "silly, little lie" that I began to realize the power of grace. All the faults and downfalls will occur, and the true measure of a man or a boy is what we do after those moments. Some tragedies occur and the reason is never known, but in the midst of all storms there is a place where we are safe, a place where we are truly loved, in the arms of Jesus Christ." - Sidewalk Prophets

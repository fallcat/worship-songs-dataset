You may find me in the midnight 
 Fallen down upon my knees 
 Or riding out another storm 
 Praying for some peace 
 Even when I feel alone 
 Jesus, this I know 
 You will never leave me 
 You will always be the one 
 Who calms the raging sea 
 You will never leave me 
 You will always be the one 
 Who's holding onto me 
 You may lead me to the desert 
 Where I'm empty and afraid 
 Wandering this nothingness 
 Thirsting for the rain 
 I will not give into fear 
 Cause Lord, I know You're here 
 You will never leave me 
 You will always be the one 
 Who calms the raging sea 
 You will never leave me 
 You will always be the one 
 Who's holding onto me 
 Tough my heart is breaking 
 And my faith is shaking 
 Standing strong 'cause I believe 
 You have promised me, You'll never leave 
 You will never leave me 
 You will always be the one 
 Who calms the raging sea 
 You will never leave me 
 You will always be the one 
 Who's holding onto me

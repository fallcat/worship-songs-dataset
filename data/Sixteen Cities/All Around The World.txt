Someday everyone will see what I have seen in You 
 This beauty beyond words 
 And I'm amazed with every breath I take 
 Yeah, I will sing of You as Your glory fills the earth 
 All around the world, from the oceans to the sky 
 Love is raining down, love is raining down 
 From the heavens to the earth like a flood that covers us 
 Love is raining down, love is raining down on us 
 Somewhere far beyond my reach are people in the dark 
 They're lost without Your light 
 But Your arms are pulling at their hearts 
 You're never letting go, You're never letting go 
 All around the world, from the oceans to the sky 
 Love is raining down, love is raining down 
 From the heavens to the earth like a flood that covers us 
 Love is raining down, love is raining down 
 Can you feel it? Can you feel it now? 
 Mercy's reaching out, we're surrounded 
 Alleluia, alleluia 
 You have saved us, You have saved us 
 All around the world, from the oceans to the sky 
 Love is raining down, love is raining down 
 From the heavens to the earth like a flood that covers us 
 Love is raining down, love is raining down on us, raining down on us

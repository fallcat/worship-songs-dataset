Pull me under now 
 Lord, I want to drown in Your river 
 Take me over now 
 Lost, in You I'm found now, I surrender 
 Consume me, Lord, every single thought 
 Consume me, Lord 'cause You are all I've got 
 There's nothing here that I want more 
 Than to be consumed by You 
 I am reaching out 
 And I'm learning how to come closer 
 I can hear the sound 
 You're calling out to me to just surrender 
 Consume me, Lord, every single thought 
 Consume me, Lord 'cause You are all I've got 
 There's nothing here that I want more 
 Than to be consumed by You 
 You're calling me deeper with Your every whisper 
 You're drawing me into You 
 Flood every part of my longing heart 
 'Til I'm consumed by You 
 Consume me, Lord, every single thought 
 Consume me, Lord 'cause You are all I've got 
 There's nothing here that I want more 
 Than to be consumed by You 
 Than to be consumed by You

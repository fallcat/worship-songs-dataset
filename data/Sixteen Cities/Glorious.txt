I remember when the light came rushing in 
 And my life with you began, it was all so different 
 I remember how you opened up my eyes 
 And I felt just like a child 
 Seein' stars for the first time 
 I can feel it in the sunlight 
 I can feel it in the dead of night 
 Your love has come for us 
 And it's glorious, You are holy, You alone are glorious 
 You're the only one who's worthy 
 From age to age You're still the same 
 You are glorious 
 I believe that You are here with us 
 And I will put my trust in You and that's enough 
 Oh, You are there when I'm breaking 
 You are there when my hands are raising 
 Jesus, for everything You've done 
 Singin' glorious, You are holy, You alone are glorious 
 You're the only one who's worthy 
 From age to age You're still the same 
 You are glorious 
 The author of the stars, You're jealous for my heart 
 Your hands are holding me and now I finally see 
 We live and breathe to worship you 
 Glorious, You are holy, You alone are glorious 
 You're the only one who's worthy 
 From age to age You're still the same 
 You are glorious, glorious, glorious

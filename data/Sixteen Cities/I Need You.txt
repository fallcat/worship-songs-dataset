Sometimes I only focus on the places that I go 
 And I forget why I get in such a hurry 
 That it all gets kinda blurry as it goes by, I try to keep my head above 
 The noise that's drowning out Your voice 
 I need You to bring Your peace I need, You to quiet me 
 Remind this heart that You are enough, I need You to bring new life 
 And break through the walls inside 
 Remind this heart that You are enough 
 This life can be distracting and I end up just reacting 'til I break down 
 I lose sight of what I'm after when I'm looking for an answer 
 So I reach out 'cause I can't do this on my own 
 So I rely on you alone on you alone 
 I need You to bring Your peace, I need you to quiet me 
 Remind this heart that You are enough, I need You to bring new life 
 And break through, the walls inside 
 Remind this heart that You are enough, Lord, You're enough 
 You're the air I need, without You I can't breathe 
 So give me eyes to see, Your hand is holding me 
 (Yes, I can hear You calling out to me) 
 I need You to bring Your peace and I need You to quiet me 
 Remind this heart that you are enough, I need You to bring new life 
 And break through the walls inside 
 Remind this heart that You are enough, I need You 
 (In the chaos, in the storm) 
 I need You 
 (In the battle, in the war) 
 I need You 
 (In the chaos, in the storm) 
 I need You

The sun is rising, a new light's shining 
 The darkness is fading away 
 Now my heart's believing 
 My eyes are seeing that everything has changed 
 Love is making a way, breaking my chains 
 Healing what was broken 
 Hope is coming alive in this heart of mine 
 This heart that You have stolen 
 Like a thief in the night You come by surprise 
 Your mercy captures me 
 And what I've done and who I was is not who I will be 
 All because 
 Love is making a way, breaking my chains 
 Healing what was broken 
 Hope is coming alive in this heart of mine 
 This heart that You have stolen 
 Lord, You have it all 
 Straight into Your arms I am falling 
 And all I've got is Yours 
 'Cause You are everything I'm living for 
 'Cause love is making a way 
 Breaking my chains, healing what was broken 
 Yeah, Your love is making a way 
 It's breaking my chains, healing what was broken 
 Hope is coming alive in this heart of mine 
 This heart that You have stolen

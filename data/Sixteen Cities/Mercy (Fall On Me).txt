Fall, fall 
 A new day is dawning, I hear You calling 
 My eyes are open and my heart's rejoicing 
 The night is over, by grace I'm covered 
 I see the signs of Your love and they're surrounding me 
 Like the air I breathe, the beauty of a symphony 
 It's everything I'll ever need, Your mercy 
 Fall, fall on me, brand new mercies, mercies fallin' 
 Fallin' down over me like healing water 
 Mercies fall, fall on me, fall, fall, fall on me, fall 
 Lord, I'm so grateful, You're willing 
 And able to open the heavens 
 Let Your glory shine down on me 
 Just like a river You're forever flowing 
 You're giving life and I will never ever thirst again 
 And I'll still believe, even when it's hard to see 
 I'll lift my hands and I will sing Your mercies 
 Fall, fall on me, brand new mercies, mercies fallin' 
 Fallin' down over me like healing water 
 Mercies fall, fall on me 
 Your love surrounds me and washes me clean 
 It reaches farther than the ocean deep as strong as a flood 
 Fall, fall on me Brand new mercies fall 
 Fall, fall on me, brand new mercies, mercies fallin' 
 Fallin' down over me like healing water 
 Mercies fallin', fall on me 
 Fall, fall on me, fall, fall on me 
 Fall like healing water fall on me

The walls are closing in 
 You feel alone, you feel afraid 
 Your heart begins to bend 
 You take a breath and then it starts to break 
 I'm all out of words 
 There's nothing I could say to you 
 To take away the hurt 
 So let me pray you through 
 Let me pray you through 
 So lift your shaking hands, don't say a word 
 I'll stay with you 
 The tears will heal the pain, you shouldn't be ashamed 
 To come undone 
 I'm all out of words 
 There's nothing I could say to you 
 To take away the hurt 
 So let me pray you through 
 Let me pray you through 
 Fall down and let me carry you 
 I'll carry you 
 I'm all out of words 
 There's nothing I could say to you 
 To take away the hurt 
 So let me pray you through 
 I'm all out of words 
 There's nothing I could say to you 
 To take away the hurt 
 So let me pray you through 
 Let me pray you through 
 Let me pray you through

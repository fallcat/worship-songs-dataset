Lost, my heart is hard as stone 
 On my own, alone, I carry it home 
 Gone, I used to waste the days 
 So distraught 
 I thought I'm changing my ways 
 And now You're changing my ways 
 You save me, save me from myself 
 'Cause there is no one else I'd lean on 
 You save me, You save me from myself 
 'Cause there is no one else to set me free 
 Start, the start of something new 
 Is what I find when I'm just looking at You 
 A lift, you lift me off the ground 
 Keep holding my hand, I won't land 
 I won't even look down 
 I won't even look down 
 You save me, save me from myself 
 'Cause there is no one else I'd lean on 
 You save me, You save me from myself 
 'Cause there is no one else to set me free 
 Your love is 
 You love is saving me 
 You save me, save me from myself 
 'Cause there is no one else I'd lean on 
 You save me, You save me from myself 
 'Cause there is no one else to set me free 
 'Cause there is no one else to set me free 
 You set me free

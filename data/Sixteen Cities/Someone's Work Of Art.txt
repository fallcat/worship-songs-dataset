Please don't change don't be afraid 
 That you're not wanted here 'cause you're wanted here 
 Don't fade away and don't hide your face 
 And all the lonely tears will disappear 
 Maybe you can't see it but I can 
 You are someone's work of art, just the way you are 
 And you're shining like the stars tonight 
 All the pieces of your heart and all the lovely scars 
 Are someone's work of art, are someone's work of art 
 When the lights go down and no one's around 
 You're still standing there wishing someone cared 
 Can you hear me now? I am screaming out 
 You're the one I choose, there's no one like you 
 Maybe you can't see it but I can 
 You are someone's work of art, just the way you are 
 And you're shining like the stars tonight 
 All the pieces of your heart and all the lovely scars 
 Are someone's work of art, are someone's work of art 
 What I see in you is beautiful, so beautiful 
 What I see in you is beautiful 
 You are someone's work of art 
 And you're shining like the stars tonight 
 You are someone's work of art, just the way you are 
 And you're shining like the stars tonight 
 All the pieces of your heart and all the lovely scars 
 Are someone's work of art, are someone's work of art

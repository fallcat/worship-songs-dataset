Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 It's all around us, moving through the streets 
 It's falling down to all of us beneath 
 We're lost in the glory of this beautiful refrain 
 There's a song that's rising up inside 
 We can't escape, we cannot deny 
 That it's in our hearts and it can never be contained 
 Tell me, tell me, can you hear the sound of love? 
 Something glorious singing over us 
 Can you feel the wonder of the song He's singing us? 
 That's the sound of love, that's the sound of love 
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Like the breath my lungs are breathing in 
 Like the hands that pick you up again 
 It gives you hope and it will never ever change 
 It's like a fire that we cannot confine 
 It's in the beat that keeps your heart alive 
 And when you hear it you will never be the same 
 Tell me, tell me, can you hear the sound of love? 
 Something glorious singing over us 
 Can you feel the wonder of the song He's singing us? 
 That's the sound of love, that's the sound of love 
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 His love is singing to ya, His love is reaching down 
 His love is callin' out, can you hear the sound of love? 
 Can you hear the sound of love? 
 Something glorious singing over us 
 Can you feel the wonder of the song He's singing us? 
 Can you hear the sound of love? 
 Something glorious singing over us 
 Can you feel the wonder of the song He's singing us? 
 That's the sound of love, that's the sound of love 
 That's the sound of love, that's the sound of love 
 That's the sound of love

Give me the wind, give me the rain 
 It's okay, it's okay 
 Let the crowd shake, let my heart break 
 It's okay, it's okay 
 You're the earth beneath my feet 
 You're the shelter I need 
 I'm sure that I'm not alone, not alone 
 Though the world tries to tell me so, tell me so 
 In this valley I'm goin' through 
 Even when it's hard to see You're still here with me 
 You're still here with me, You're still here 
 You're still here with me, yeah, You're still here 
 Here's my heart, let it go 
 Hold me close, hold me close 
 And I've got to learn to trust you 
 'Cause I know, yeah, I know 
 You're the earth beneath my feet 
 You're the shelter I need 
 I'm sure that I'm not alone, not alone 
 Though the world tries to tell me so, tell me so 
 In this valley I'm goin' through 
 Even when it's hard to see You're still here with me 
 You're still here with me, You're still here, yeah 
 You're still here with me, yeah, You're still here with me 
 You're still here with me, yeah, You're still here 
 You're still here with me, You're still here with me 
 I'm sure that I'm not alone, not alone 
 Though the world tries to tell me so, tell me so 
 In this valley I'm goin' through 
 Even when it's hard to see You're right here with me 
 I'm sure that I'm not alone, not alone 
 Though the world tries to tell me so 
 'Cause I know in this valley I'm goin' through 
 Even when it's hard to see You're still here with me 
 You're still here with me, yeah, You're still here 
 You're still here with me, You're still here with me 
 You're still here with me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You're still here with me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You're still here with me, yeah, You're still here 
 You're still here with me, yeah, You're still here

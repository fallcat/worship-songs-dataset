Standing here, staring at the sky 
 Sometimes I wonder why You chose to do this all for me, for me 
 I'm in awe that the very Son of God would step into the void inside 
 This lost and lonely soul, oh, just one word, and there was light 
 What it must be like to see the world through Your eyes? 
 And to hear the prayers of the broken heart and be the breath of life 
 Oh, what it must be like to hold the stars in place? 
 And Your glory shines over all the earth, forever You will reign 
 What it must be like 
 Everyday, I see the ending's grace 
 Every breath You've given me is just another chance 
 To realize Your majesty reaches far and wide 
 What it must be like to see the world through Your eyes? 
 And to hear the prayers of the broken heart and be the breath of life 
 What it must be like to hold the stars in place? 
 And Your glory shines over all the earth, forever You will reign 
 Your love for me, yeah, Your love for me 
 It is wide, it is deep and it's everything I need 
 Your love for me, yeah, Your love for me 
 It is wide, it is deep and it's everything I need 
 What it must be like to see the world through Your eyes? 
 And to hear the prayers of the broken heart and be the breath of life 
 What it must be like to hold the stars in place? 
 And Your glory shines over all the earth, forever You will reign 
 What it must be like? What it must be like?

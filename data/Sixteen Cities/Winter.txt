How did I ever get this broken? 
 I never meant to fall this far 
 I feel like I'm completely frozen 
 Can I find a way back to where You are? 
 'Cause I've been searching for the sun 
 But I don't know if anyone 
 Could tell me how to find my way home 
 All the things that I've become 
 Are all the things I'm running from 
 I don't want my heart to turn to stone 
 This cold has been so bitter 
 Can you save me from this winter? 
 It came creeping in so slowly 
 And now it's covered up the truth 
 In the name of being holy 
 We got so far away from You 
 'Cause I've been searching for the sun 
 But I don't know if anyone 
 Could tell me how to find my way home 
 All the things that I've become 
 Are all the things I'm running from 
 I don't want my heart to turn to stone 
 This cold has been bitter 
 Can you save me from this winter? 
 Can you save me from this winter? 
 Can you save me from this winter? 
 Can you save me from this winter? 
 Can you save me from this winter? 
 'Cause I've been searching for the sun 
 But I don't know if anyone 
 Could tell me how to find my way home 
 All the things that I've become 
 Are all the things I'm running from 
 I don't want my heart to turn to stone 
 'Cause I've been searching for the sun 
 But I don't know if anyone 
 Could tell me how to find my way home 
 All the things that I've become 
 Are all the things I'm running from 
 I don't want my heart to turn to stone 
 This cold has been so bitter 
 Can you save me from this winter? 
 This cold has been so bitter 
 Can you save me from this winter?

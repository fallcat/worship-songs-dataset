Love is all around you now so take a hold 
 Hidden in our words it sometimes ain't enough 
 Don't suffocate day after day, it's building up 
 'Cause when you're feeling weak you know I'm strong enough 
 Just one more day 
 One more day 
 Oh, let the world crash love can take it 
 Oh, let the world come crashing down 
 Oh, let the world crash love can take it 
 Love can take a little, love can give a little more 
 Love is indestructible so take a hold 
 Sometimes hard to find a reason good enough 
 I'll stand beside you never leave, through it all 
 And faith will bring a way to the impossible 
 Just one more day 
 One more day 
 Oh, let the world crash love can take it 
 Oh, let the world come crashing down 
 Oh, let the world crash love can take it 
 Love can take a little, love can give a little more 
 You can find me 
 You can find me 
 You can find me anywhere 
 Take a look over you shoulder 
 I'll be standing there 
 Standing there 
 Love is all around you now so take a hold 
 And faith will bring a way to the impossible 
 Just one more day (You can find me) 
 One more day (You can find me) 
 One more day (You can find me anywhere) 
 One more day (You can find me) 
 One more day (You can find me) 
 One more day (You can find me anywhere) 
 Oh, let the world crash love can take it 
 Oh, let the world come crashing down 
 Oh, let the world crash love can take it 
 Love can take a little 
 Love can take a little 
 Love can take a little, love can give... a little more 
 A little more 
 Take a little more 
 Take a little more 
 Whoa, take it 
 A little more

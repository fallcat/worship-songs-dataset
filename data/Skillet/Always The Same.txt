You never change 
 Always the same 
 Always the same 
 Always the same 
 You never change 
 Always the same 
 Always the same 
 Always the same 
 Strange how everything 
 Seems to rearrange 
 Apart from who You are 
 Nations rise and fall 
 Build, rebuild the walls 
 They all fall down 
 But nothing shakes You 
 Nothing shakes You 
 Nothing shakes You down 
 Seasons come and go 
 But You're immutable 
 I hide myself in You 
 The shaking of our lives 
 Strength to strength we rise 
 Anchored in You 
 Nothing shakes You 
 Nothing shakes You 
 Nothing shakes You down 
 Spinning, spinning, the whole world just spins around 
 People to people all trying just to figure out 
 Moving, moving, where's the power to slow it down 
 Staying, standing, standing on the strength I've found

Angry words and honking cars 
 Satellites and fallen stars 
 Distant dark blue radios 
 That whisper down my boulevards 
 Ghosts in chains rattle in the attic 
 Broken headphones filled with static 
 Lonely room, you've got nowhere to run 
 Three... Two... One for all and all for one 
 Times will be bad, times will be good 
 Things I wish I hadn't done and 
 Some I wish I would 
 Cutting through the American noise 
 You've got a voice 
 And a song to sing (and a song to sing) 
 Drink deep in the morning 
 Drink deep in the morning 
 See what the day will bring 
 La da da da, lift up your voice 
 Let love cut through the American noise 
 La da da da, lift up your voice 
 Let love cut through the American noise 
 Slamming doors and cell phone rings 
 Hurricane force of silent screams 
 Don't know what to believe 
 Bend the rule just to break it 
 You're so tired 'cause to got to fake it 
 But you just wanna be someone 
 Three... Two... One for all and all for one 
 Times will be bad, times will be good 
 Things I wish I hadn't done and 
 Some I wish I would 
 Cutting through the American noise 
 You've got a voice 
 And a song to sing (and a song to sing) 
 Drink deep in the morning 
 Drink deep in the morning 
 See what the day will bring 
 La da da da, lift up your voice 
 Let love cut through the American noise 
 La da da da, lift up your voice 
 Let love cut through the American noise 
 No matter who you are, you've got a voice 
 Why don't you use it? 
 Sing your own song, take all the noise 
 And make it into music! 
 La da da da La da da da 
 La da da daaaa 
 La da da da La da da da 
 La da da daaaaaaa 
 La da da da lift up your voice 
 Let love cut through the American noise 
 La da da da you have a choice 
 Let love cut through the American noise 
 You've got a voice! 
 Let love cut through the American noise!

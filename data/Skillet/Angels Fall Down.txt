I saw angels fall down 
 At the glory of the Lord 
 And as I raise my hands I sing 
 I saw angels fall down 
 At the glory of the Lord 
 And as I hit the ground I sing 
 And I fall down 
 Afraid and shaking here 
 And I fall down 
 I'm perfectly safe right here 
 I saw angels fall down 
 At the glory of the Lord 
 The hurt and the broken find rest here 
 I saw angels fall down 
 At the beauty of the Lord 
 And as I kneeled I cried to know Him 
 And I fall down 
 Afraid and shaking here 
 And I fall down 
 I'm perfectly safe in here 
 I'm perfectly safe in here 
 I'm perfectly safe in here 
 Yeah...

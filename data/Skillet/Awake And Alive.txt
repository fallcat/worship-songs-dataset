I'm at war with the world and they 
 Try to pull me into the dark 
 I struggle to find my faith 
 As I'm slippin' from your arms 
 It's getting harder to stay awake 
 And my strength is fading fast 
 You breathe into me at last 
 I'm awake I'm alive 
 Now I know what I believe inside 
 Now it's my time 
 I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life 
 Here, right here 
 Right now, right now 
 Stand my ground and never back down 
 I know what I believe inside 
 I'm awake and I'm alive 
 I'm at war with the world 'cause I 
 Ain't never gonna sell my soul 
 I've already made up my mind 
 No matter what I can't be bought or sold 
 When my faith is getting weak 
 And I feel like giving in 
 You breathe into me again 
 I'm awake I'm alive 
 Now I know what I believe inside 
 Now it's my time 
 I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life 
 Here, right here 
 Right now, right now 
 Stand my ground and never back down 
 I know what I believe inside 
 I'm awake and I'm alive 
 Waking up waking up 
 Waking up waking up 
 Waking up waking up 
 Waking up waking up 
 In the dark 
 I can feel you in my sleep 
 In your arms I feel you breathe into me 
 Forever hold this heart that I will give to you 
 Forever I will live for you 
 I'm awake I'm alive 
 Now I know what I believe inside 
 Now it's my time 
 I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life 
 Here, right here 
 Right now, right now 
 Stand my ground and never back down 
 I know what I believe inside 
 I'm awake and I'm alive 
 Waking up waking up 
 Waking up waking up 
 Waking up waking up 
 Waking up waking up

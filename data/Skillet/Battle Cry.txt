You're on the edge, I've given up 
 You know I feel it too 
 It won't be long because 
 I'm with you 
 Bring the fire, bring the smoke, 
 Bring the rain 
 We will bend, but we will never break 
 If we believe we can't lose 
 Even mountains will move 
 It's my faith, it's my life, 
 This is our battle cry! 
 They can't take us down, 
 If we stand our ground 
 If we live, if we die, 
 We will shout out, our battle cry 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you hear it? 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you feel it? 
 It seems like no one knows, 
 How you've been feeling 
 You're hiding all your hopes, 
 You've stopped believing 
 It's not over, we're one step away 
 We will bend, but we will never break 
 If we believe we can't lose 
 Even mountains will move 
 It's my faith, it's my life, 
 This is our battle cry! 
 They can't take us down, 
 If we stand our ground 
 If we live, if we die, 
 We will shout out, our battle cry 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you hear it? 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you feel it? 
 Let it rise like a prayer in the night 
 Shout for love, shout for hope 
 Let 'em hear us! 
 Ohoooh 
 Ohoooh 
 I believe we can't lose 
 Even mountains will move 
 It's our faith, it's our life, 
 This is our battle cry! 
 They can't take us down, 
 If we stand our ground 
 If we live, if we die, 
 We will shout out, our battle cry 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you hear it? 
 (Can you hear it?) 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you feel it? 
 (Can you feel it?) 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you hear it? 
 (I can feel it) 
 Ohoooh 
 Can you feel it? 
 Ohoooh 
 (Can you feel it?) 
 Ohoooh 
 (Can you feel it?) 
 Ohoooh 
 (I can feel it) 
 Ohoooh 
 (I can feel it) 
 Ohoooh 
 (I can feel it) 
 Ohoooh 
 (I can feel it)

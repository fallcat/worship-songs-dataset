I'm still trying to figure out how to tell you I was wrong; 
 I can't fill the emptiness inside since you've been gone; 
 So is it you, or is it me? 
 I know I said things that I didn't mean; 
 But you should have known me by now, 
 You should've known me... 
 If you believed, 
 When I said, 
 "I'd be better off without you," 
 Then you never really knew me at all! 
 If you believed, 
 When I said, 
 That I wouldn't be thinking about you, 
 You thought you knew the truth but you're wrong! 
 You're all that I need! 
 Just tell me that you still believe! 
 I can't undo the things that led us to this place, 
 But I know there's something more to us than our mistakes; 
 So is it you, or is it me? 
 I know I'm so blind when we don't agree; 
 But you should've known me by now, 
 You should've known me... 
 If you believed, 
 When I said, 
 "I'd be better off without you," 
 Then you never really knew me at all! 
 If you believed, 
 When I said, 
 That I wouldn't be thinking about you, 
 You thought you knew the truth but you're wrong! 
 You're all that I need! 
 Just tell me that you still believe! 
 Is it you, or is it me? 
 I know I said things that I didn't mean; 
 But you should have known me by now, 
 You should've known me... 
 If you believed, 
 When I said, 
 "I'd be better off without you," 
 Then you never really knew me at all! 
 If you believed, 
 When I said, 
 That I wouldn't be thinking about you, 
 You thought you knew the truth but you're wrong! 
 'Cause you're all that I want; 
 Don't you even know me at all!? 
 You're all that I need! 
 Just tell me that you still believe!

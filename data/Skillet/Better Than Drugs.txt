Feel your every heartbeat 
 Feel you on these empty nights 
 Calm the ache, stop the shakes 
 You clear my mind 
 You're my escape 
 From this messed up place 
 'Cause you let me forget 
 You numb my pain 
 How can I tell you just all that you are 
 What you do to me 
 You're better than drugs 
 Your love is like wine 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' to get me high 
 You're better than drugs 
 Addicted for life 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' on to get me high 
 Feel you when I'm restless 
 Feel you when I cannot cope 
 You're my addiction, my prescription, my antidote 
 You kill the poison 
 Ease the suffering 
 Calm the rage when I'm afraid 
 To feel again 
 How can I tell you just all that you are 
 What you do to me 
 You're better than drugs 
 Your love is like wine 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' to get me high 
 You're better than drugs 
 Addicted for life 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' on to get me high 
 How can I tell you just all that you are 
 What you do to me 
 Feel your every heartbeat 
 Feel you on these empty nights 
 You're the strength of my life 
 You're better than drugs 
 Your love is like wine 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' to get me high 
 You're better than drugs 
 Addicted for life 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' on to get me high 
 Feel your every heartbeat 
 Feel you on these empty nights 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' to get me high 
 Feel your every heartbeat 
 Feel you come to get me high 
 Feel you comin' on so fast 
 Feel you comin' on to get me high 
 To get me high

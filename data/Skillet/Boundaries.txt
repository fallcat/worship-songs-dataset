I stand here closed and open 
 Praying for the summer rains 
 Reaching in to pull back the curtains 
 Ruling in this desolate land 
 I will let me go 
 My walls melt away 
 You have no boundaries 
 You cross my borders 
 You have no boundaries 
 You crash my borders 
 I lie here clothed and naked 
 Dam bursts to cool ocean waves 
 Black water cleans the highway 
 Resting in the washing away 
 I will let me go 
 My walls melt away 
 You have no boundaries 
 You cross my borders 
 You have no boundaries 
 You crash my borders 
 You are more than all that is outside of me 
 You are more than that which is inside of me 
 You have no boundaries 
 I have no borders from you 
 You have no boundaries 
 I have no borders

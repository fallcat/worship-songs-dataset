Do you ever wish that you weren't a prisoner? 
 Do you feel like you're done? 
 All the dreams you had are hard to remember 
 Well, you're not the only one 
 Well it's over, it's over, it's over 
 I won't be pushed around 
 Move over, move over, move over 
 Get back or just get out 
 Set this plane up in flames 
 It's over, it's over, it's over 
 It's time to burn it down 
 This one goes to the castaways 
 Who break their backs slaving every day 
 All these things I can do without 
 Gotta burn it down, burn it down 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 Do you ever feel your colors are fading 
 Like your world might combust 
 Do the voices in your head make you crazy 
 When they're the only ones you trust 
 Well it's over, it's over, it's over 
 I won't be pushed around 
 Move over, move over, move over 
 Get back or just get out 
 Set this plane up in flames 
 It's over, it's over, it's over 
 It's time to burn it down 
 This one goes to the castaways 
 Who break their backs slaving every day 
 All these things I can do without 
 Gotta burn it down, burn it down 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 It's over, it's over, it's over 
 Move over, move over, move over 
 It's over, it's over, it's over 
 I won't be pushed around 
 Move over, move over, move over 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 This one goes to the castaways 
 Who break their backs slaving every day 
 All these things I can do without 
 Gotta burn it down, burn it down 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 (I won't be pushed around) 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 (Get back or just get out) 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 (I won't be pushed around) 
 Burn it down, burn it down 
 (Get back or just get out) 
 Burn it down, burn it down

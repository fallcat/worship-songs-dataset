(Psycho, go, go, go!) 
 (A psycho, here we go!) 
 You push me till I break 
 And the anger turns to rage 
 Why can't you just leave me alone? 
 Got your finger on the trigger, 
 You think that you're the winner 
 But you're gonna get kicked 
 Off of your throne 
 No! 
 No! 
 You think you're gonna hurt me, 
 Get ready to get dirty 
 You created this beast inside! 
 (This beast inside!) 
 Pull the noose tighter and lift a little higher 
 'Cause you're killing me slow, I ain't ready to die 
 (You're killing me slow but I ain't ready to die) 
 Tonight, get ready for a fight! 
 So now you know its time to ride, 
 My circus for a psycho! 
 Round and round we go, look out below 
 'Cause I want off this, I want off this! 
 Circus for a psycho! (Psycho, go, go, go!) 
 Circus for a psycho! (Psycho, here we go!) 
 (Psycho, here we go!) 
 Everybody down, gonna burn it to the ground 
 Can't keep this beast inside! 
 Never again! Never again! 
 You're killing me slow but I ain't ready to die! 
 (You're killing me slow but I ain't ready to die) 
 Tonight, get ready for a fight! 
 So now you know its time to ride, 
 My circus for a psycho! 
 Round and round we go, look out below 
 'Cause I want off this, I want off this! 
 Circus for a psycho! (Psycho, go, go, go!) 
 Circus for a psycho! (Psycho, here we go!) 
 = Guitar Solo = 
 You think you're gonna hurt me, 
 Get ready to get dirty 
 Gonna burn this place to the ground! 
 Tonight, get ready for a fight! 
 So now you know its time to ride, 
 My circus for a psycho! 
 Round and round we go, look out below 
 Its time to ride my circus for a psycho! 
 Never again! Never again! 
 You're killing me slow, but I ain't ready to die! 
 Round and round we go, look out below 
 'Cause I want off this, I want off this! 
 Circus for a psycho! (Psycho, go, go, go!) 
 Circus for a psycho! (Psycho, here we go!)

We have fallen 
 We have fallen again tonight 
 Where do we go from here 
 When they're tearing down our lives 
 When all they want is 
 When all they want is 
 For us to live in fear 
 How long can we hold on 
 Can we hold on 
 Hold on 
 There's something deep inside 
 That keeps my faith alive 
 When all you can do 
 Is hide from the fear 
 That's deep inside of you 
 Summon, summon something 
 Summon, summon something 
 To hold me close when I don't know 
 There's something deep inside 
 That keeps my faith alive 
 We are healing 
 But it's killing us inside 
 Can we take a chance 
 When faith and fear collide 
 We can make it 
 Step out and take it 
 We can't live feeling so numb 
 How long can we hold on 
 Can we hold on 
 Hold on 
 There's something deep inside 
 That keeps my faith alive 
 When all you can do 
 Is hide from the fear 
 That's deep inside of you 
 Summon, summon something 
 Summon, summon something 
 To hold me close when I don't know 
 There's something deep inside 
 That keeps my faith alive 
 There's something deep inside 
 That keeps my faith alive 
 When all you can do 
 Is hide from the fear 
 That's deep inside of you 
 Summon, summon something 
 Summon, summon something 
 To hold me close when I don't know 
 There's something deep inside 
 That keeps my faith alive

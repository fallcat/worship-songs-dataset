I hate feeling like this 
 I'm so tired of trying to fight this 
 I'm asleep and all I dream of 
 Is waking to you 
 Tell me that you will listen 
 Your touch is what I'm missing 
 And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losing you 
 Comatose 
 I'll never wake up without an overdose of you 
 I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe 
 'Less I feel you next to me 
 You take the pain I feel 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 I don't wanna sleep, I don't wanna dream 
 'Cause my dreams don't comfort me 
 The way you make me feel 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 I hate living without you 
 Dead wrong to ever doubt you 
 But my demons lay in waiting 
 Tempting me away 
 Oh how I adore you 
 Oh how I thirst for you 
 Oh how I need you 
 Comatose 
 I'll never wake up without an overdose of you 
 I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe 
 'Less I feel you next to me 
 You take the pain I feel 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 I don't wanna sleep, I don't wanna dream 
 'Cause my dreams don't comfort me 
 The way you make me feel 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 Breathing life 
 Waking up 
 My eyes open up 
 Comatose 
 I'll never wake up without an overdose of you 
 I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe 
 'Less I feel you next to me 
 You take the pain I feel 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 I don't wanna sleep, I don't wanna dream 
 'Cause my dreams don't comfort me 
 The way you make me feel 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 Oh how I adore you 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 Oh how I thirst for you 
 Waking up to you never felt so real 
 Oh how I adore you 
 Oh 
 The way you make me feel 
 Waking up to you never felt so real

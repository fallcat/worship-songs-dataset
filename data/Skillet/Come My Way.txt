Hundreds come, 
 From everywhere. 
 Just to see your face, 
 Touch the healer's hand. 
 Desperate, 
 I push through the crowd. 
 If I could touch your clothes, 
 I could feel your power. 
 Come my way, come my way. 
 Come my way, come my way. 
 Please no-notice me. 
 Just to release my pain, 
 Just to know your name. 
 Come my way, come my way. 
 Come my way, (won't you) come my way. 
 I'm outta touch, I'm outta reach 
 I've got the faith to believe. 
 Oh, am I out of touch, or out of reach? 
 What would it take for you to walk towards me? 
 I'm out of touch, outta reach, 
 But I'm running towards you, 
 And it's all I believe. 
 Come my way, come my way, yeah 
 Come my way, (won't you) come my way 
 Yeah, come my way, come my way 
 Come my way, (won't you) come my way 
 Just a touch.

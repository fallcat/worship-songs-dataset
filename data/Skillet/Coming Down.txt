Things are coming down 
 Things are coming down I can tell you 
 Beautiful the sound 
 Of things coming down 'cause I heard Him say 
 Divisions coming down 
 I saw peace on a white horse riding 
 Love is spreading around 
 The most contagious disease we've ever known 
 I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life 
 I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice 
 I will breathe of the breath of the body of God 
 I will dive to the depths 
 And I will raise a new man 
 Racism's coming down 
 Not from a law, but a change in perception 
 Revival's spreading around 
 I hear the sound of reapers already say 
 I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life 
 I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice 
 I will breathe of the breath of the body of God 
 I will dive to the depths 
 And I will raise a new man 
 Our knees are going down 
 To the One who brings fear to my every bone 
 His kindom's raining down 
 Who can stop the plans of the Lord? 
 I say 
 I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life 
 I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice 
 I will breathe of the breath of the body of God 
 I will dive to the depths 
 And I will raise a new man 
 I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life 
 I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice 
 I will breathe of the breath of the body of God 
 I will dive to the depths 
 And I will raise a new man

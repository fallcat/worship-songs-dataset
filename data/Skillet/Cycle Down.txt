Crashing 
 Covered with debris 
 Dwelling in my own pity 
 Cry like I have not 
 Dig like I had not 
 I start to claw 
 Gotta get outta here 
 I've got to, gotta get out 
 I am, I am, I am on a higher ground 
 You are, You are my cure from the cycle down 
 Sinking 
 In a sea of self 
 Deception 
 Never sold so well 
 Regret like I have not 
 Pain like I don't want 
 I start to claw 
 Gotta get outta here 
 I've got to, gotta get out 
 I'm so cold and I wonder 
 How'd I make it this long without You 
 Pull me out, out from under 
 On the cycle back to You

To find this love of mine, 
 I'd walk through wind and fire, 
 Forever, and always; 
 These hollow hands reach out, 
 For You to touch me now, 
 Forever, and always; 
 Dead inside! 
 My heart and soul flatline; 
 Put your mouth on mine, 
 And bring me back to life; 
 Dead inside! 
 No other satisfies; 
 My blood runs dry, 
 Take my life, 
 Save me from this death inside! 
 I can't escape this love, 
 I want it the way it was; 
 Forever, and always; 
 Don't you leave me here, 
 Alone in all this fear, 
 Forever, and always... 
 Dead inside! 
 My heart and soul flatline; 
 Put your mouth on mine, 
 And bring me back to life; 
 Dead inside! 
 No other satisfies; 
 My blood runs dry, 
 Take my life, 
 Save me from this death inside! 
 I can't escape this love, 
 I want it the way it was; 
 You remind me of a time, 
 When I felt alive... 
 Dead inside! 
 My heart and soul flatline; 
 Put your mouth on mine, 
 And bring me back to life; 
 Dead inside! 
 No other satisfies; 
 My blood runs dry, 
 Take my life, 
 Save me from this death inside! 
 My blood runs dry, 
 Take my life, 
 Save me from this death inside!

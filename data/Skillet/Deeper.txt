Jesus pure truth 
 Recollect my mind (ya-di-da-da-da) 
 Hurt that I push down 
 Shows my anger why 
 I can't go underground 
 Everything I bury gets exhumed 
 I gotta dig deeper 
 And all the things I bury gets exhumed 
 I gotta dig deeper 
 I must get used 
 To strength out of weakl (ya-di-da-da-da) 
 Becoming by what I give 
 Not by what I can keep 
 Exposed before you 
 Everything I bury get exhumed 
 I gotta dig deeper 
 And all the things I bury get exhumed 
 I gotta dig deeper 
 How can I hide deeper 
 How do I fly deeper 
 And everything I bury gets exhumed 
 And all the things I bury gets exhumed

I thought distinctly 
 Different from now 
 Wonder dramatically 
 All about everything always 
 All my pushing 
 Becomes nothing... 
 I shake the fear 
 I used to compensate 
 For what I couldn't achieve 
 I conquered dreams 
 Forgetting what they were 
 All my pushing 
 Become nothing 
 All my falling 
 Is into You 
 (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 Jump over on (Everybody now) 
 Dive over in (C'mon yeah-yeah) 
 'Cause it's just not enough 
 To stand at the edge (You gotta dive over in) 
 Now I am voiceless 
 Senseless at Your mercy 
 You draw me wildly 
 All my remainder 
 All my pushing 
 Become nothing 
 All my falling 
 Is into You 
 (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 Jump over on (Everybody now) 
 Dive over in (C'mon yeah-yeah) 
 'Cause it's just not enough 
 To stand at the edge (You gotta dive over in) 
 All my pushing 
 Become nothing 
 All my falling 
 Is into You 
 (Yeah yeah yeah) 
 Jump over on (Everybody now) 
 Dive over in (C'mon yeah-yeah) 
 'Cause it's just not enough 
 To stand at the edge (You gotta dive over in) 
 (Repeat)

I went to bed, I was thinking about you 
 It ain’t the same since I'm living without you 
 All the memories are getting colder 
 All the things that I wanna do over 
 I went to bed, I was thinking about you 
 I wanna talk and laugh like we used to 
 When I see you in my dreams at night 
 It's so real but it’s in my mind 
 And now, I guess, 
 This is as good as it gets 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause I don't wanna leave this dream 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough 
 When it's you I'm dreaming of 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 I went to bed, I was thinking about you 
 And how it felt when I finally found you 
 It's like a movie playing over in my head 
 Don't wanna look, ’cause i know how it ends 
 All the words that I said that I wouldn't say 
 All the promises I made that I wouldn't break 
 It’s last call, last song, last dance 
 ’Cause I can't get you back, can't get a second chance 
 And now, I guess 
 This is as good as it gets 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause I don't wanna leave this dream 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough 
 When it's you I'm dreaming of 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 Don't wake me 
 We're together just you and me 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause we're happy like we used to be 
 I know, I've gotta let you go 
 But I don't want to be alone 
 These dreams of you keep on growing stronger 
 It ain’t a lot but it’s all I have 
 Nothing to do but keep sleeping longer 
 Don't wanna stop, cause I want you back 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause I don't wanna leave this dream 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough 
 When it's you I'm dreaming of 
 I don't wanna wake up 
 Don't wake me 
 We're together just you and me 
 Don't wake me 
 ’Cause we're happy like we used to be 
 I know, I've gotta let you go 
 But I don't want to be alone 
 I went to bed, I was thinking about you 
 ’Cause I don't wanna leave this dream 
 Ain’t the same since I'm living without you 
 'Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough 
 I know, I've gotta let you go 
 But I don't want to wake up

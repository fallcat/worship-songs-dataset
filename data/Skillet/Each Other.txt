I am yours; you are mine 
 Believe in you, friend of mine 
 You're not fading in my eyes 
 Could you stay? Could you stay? 
 We must hold on to our faith in each other 
 We must let go of our pain, yeah I said 
 We must hold on to our faith in each other 
 Gotta still believe in each other 
 Time is short to live the life 
 Don't give up, friend of mine 
 Strength to rise on more time 
 Could you stand? Could you stand? 
 We must hold on to our faith in each other 
 We must let go of our pain, yeah I said 
 We must hold on to our faith in each other 
 Gotta still believe in each other 
 It's ok to feel weak 
 It's ok to fall down 
 It's ok to lose sight 
 But we've gotta believe and stand together 
 We must hold on to our faith in each other 
 We must let go of our pain, yeah I said 
 We must hold on to our faith in each other 
 Gotta still believe in each other

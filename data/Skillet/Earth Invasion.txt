One man 
 One mission 
 One more plot to save the world 
 Reclaim all races 
 And embrace our destiny 
 Changing history 
 When the colliding comes 
 Where will you run? 
 Come with us if you want to live 
 Join us in the army that's arising 
 The truth invades your mind 
 Everyday the kingdom is advancing 
 The Earth invasion has just begun 
 Without sound 
 Without fear 
 It attacks the heart and soul 
 To rule all life 
 And display His government 
 Changing history 
 When the colliding comes 
 Where will you run? 
 Come with us if you want to live 
 Join us in the army that's arising 
 The truth invades your mind 
 Everyday the kingdom is advancing 
 The Earth invasion has just begun 
 Join us in the army that's arising 
 Let the truth invade your mind 
 Everyday the kingdom is advancing 
 The Earth invasion has just begun 
 The Earth's frustration 
 To be whole again 
 We'll see a nation 
 Living without sin 
 The Earth invasion 
 One man 
 One mission 
 One plot to save the world 
 Join us in the army that's arising 
 The truth invades your mind 
 Everyday the kingdom is advancing 
 The Earth invasion has just begun 
 Join us in the army that's arising 
 Let the truth invade your mind 
 Everyday the kingdom is advancing 
 The Earth invasion has just begun

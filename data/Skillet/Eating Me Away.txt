It's eating me away 
 I said to God 
 It's rotting in my mind 
 It's like a cancer 
 Is there anything, anything at all to numb the nothingness 
 I need a reason to breathe 
 It's eating me away 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 It's eating me away 
 It nibbles at my brain 
 The question of my existence 
 And the matter of pain 
 I shake my fist, I shake my fist 
 At the cosmos and my insignificance 
 I need a reason to breathe 
 It's eating me away 
 Save me from my rage 
 And my humanity 
 I'm more nothing than being 
 Is this my legacy 
 Feel it eating me away 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack 
 Come on and save me 
 All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack 
 Come on and save me 
 Save me from my rage 
 And my humanity 
 I'm more nothing than being 
 Is this my legacy 
 Feel it eating me away 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack 
 Come on and save me 
 All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack 
 Come on and save me 
 It's eating me away 
 Save me from my rage 
 And my humanity 
 I'm more nothing than being 
 Is this my legacy 
 Feel it eating me away 
 Yeah, yeah...

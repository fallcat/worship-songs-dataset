Power is another word that I use to describe You 
 Your mighty winds come in and blow me away 
 Frightening, coming at me like lightning 
 It's You that I fear, yeah yeah 
 I shake whenever You speak my name 
 And I'm surrounded 
 You overpower me 
 You're a silent rage 
 You're a hurricane 
 You are everything I can not see and can't explain 
 You're an enigma wrapped in a mystery 
 Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy 
 Divine is a reality that You define 
 You defy time 
 I see You in everything in fire and wind and rain 
 Captured is just the word to capture how I feel when I'm still 
 You are what I crave 
 You set me free I want to be Your slave 
 And I'm surrounded 
 You overpower me 
 You're a silent rage 
 You're a hurricane 
 You are everything I can not see and can't explain 
 You're an enigma wrapped in a mystery 
 Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy 
 (I can't escape Your energy) 
 (I can't escape Your energy) 
 (I can't escape Your energy) 
 (I can't escape Your energy) 
 I can't escape Your energy 
 I can't escape Your energy 
 I can't escape Your energy 
 I can't escape Your energy

Chasing these shadows 
 Around this darkened room 
 I've laid here so long 
 I don't even want to move 
 I need a minute now to heal 
 I need a minute now 
 To remember how to feel 
 Whenever you're gone away, 
 The darkness hides the day 
 Whenever you're gone, 
 The bleeding won't stop 
 It hurts till you come back 
 Everything goes black 
 Everything goes black 
 I reached out for you when 
 I needed you to be there 
 (All alone, chasing these shadows) 
 I don't want the pain, but, 
 I'd rather hurt then not care 
 (It's so long, You've been away from here) 
 I need a reason now to heal 
 (I need something to believe in) 
 I need a reason now 
 To remember how to feel 
 Whenever you're gone away, 
 The darkness hides the day 
 Whenever you're gone, 
 The bleeding won't stop 
 It hurts till you come back 
 Everything goes black 
 Everything goes black 
 Give me something to believe in, 
 I still believe in you 
 (But if you're never here, and I'm left all alone, 
 Tell me what I am supposed to do?) 
 Whenever you're gone away, 
 The darkness hides the day 
 Whenever you're gone, 
 The bleeding won't stop 
 It hurts till you come back 
 Everything goes black 
 Everything goes black 
 Everything goes black 
 (Whenever you're gone) 
 Everything goes black

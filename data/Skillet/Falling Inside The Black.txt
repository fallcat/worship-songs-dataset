Tonight I'm so alone, this sorrow takes ahold 
 Don't leave me here so cold 
 (Never want to be so cold) 
 Your touch used to be so kind, your touch used to give me life 
 I've waited all this time, I've wasted so much time 
 Don't leave me alone, 'cause I barely see at all 
 Don't leave me alone, I'm 
 Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks 
 Falling to the depths, can I ever go back? 
 Dreaming of the way it used to be 
 (Can you hear me?) 
 Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks 
 Falling to the depths, can I ever go back? 
 Falling inside the black 
 Falling inside, falling inside the black 
 You were my source of strength, I've traded everything 
 That I love for this one thing 
 (Stranded in the offering) 
 Don't leave me here like this, can't hear me scream from the abyss 
 And now I wish for you, my desire 
 Don't leave me alone, 'cause I barely see at all 
 Don't leave me alone, I'm 
 Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks 
 Falling to the depths, can I ever go back? 
 Dreaming of the way it used to be 
 (Can you hear me?) 
 Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks 
 Falling to the depths, can I ever go back? 
 Falling inside the black 
 Falling inside, falling inside the black 
 Black, black, black 
 (Falling in the black, black, black) 
 (Slipping through the cracks, cracks, cracks) 
 Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks 
 Falling to the depths, can I ever go back? 
 Dreaming of the way it used to be 
 (Can you hear me?) 
 Falling in the black, slipping through the cracks 
 Falling to the depths, can I ever go back? 
 Falling inside the black 
 (Can you hear me?) 
 Falling inside the black 
 (Can you hear me?) 
 Falling inside the black 
 (Can you hear me?) 
 Falling inside 
 Falling inside, falling inside the black

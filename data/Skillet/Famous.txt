I testify, this is not a secret meant to keep 
 Your love, like fire, spreading from my heart straight to my feet 
 And when I was dead, you gave me new life 
 I'm lifting you up with all of my might 
 I don't care who's to the left, to the right 
 You're all that's on my mind 
 Don't really care what they say, what they think 
 I feel so alive 
 I'm unashamed, I'm wide awake 
 Not gonna hide, can't deny you're my everything 
 Here's to the free who still believe 
 You're the star of the show that we came to see 
 With all my heart, all my life, gonna live it loud 
 I wanna make, make you famous 
 Light up the night, let it shine, never burning out 
 I wanna make, make you famous 
 Fame, fame, fame fame, f-famous 
 Fame, fame, fame fame, f-famous 
 Neon lights, my eyes are blinded by your glow 
 Yeah, you are mine, I know who I am 'cause of who I know 
 I'm no longer dead, you gave me new life 
 I'm lifting you up with all of my might 
 I don't care who's to the left, to the right 
 You're all that's on my mind 
 Don't really care what they say, what they think 
 I feel so alive 
 I'm unashamed, I'm wide awake 
 Not gonna hide, can't deny you're my everything

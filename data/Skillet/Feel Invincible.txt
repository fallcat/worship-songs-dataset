Target on my back, lone survivor lasts 
 They got me in their sights 
 No surrender, no trigger, fingers go 
 Livin' the dangerous life 
 Hey hey hey, everyday when I wake 
 I'm tryin' to get up, they're knocking me down 
 Chewing me up, spitting me out 
 Hey hey hey, when I need to be saved 
 You're making me strong, you're making me stand 
 Never will fall, never will end 
 Shot like a rocket up into the sky 
 Nothing could stop me tonight 
 You make me feel invincible, earthquake, powerful 
 Just like a tidal wave, you make me brave 
 You're my titanium, fight song, raising up 
 Like a roar of victory in a stadium 
 Who can touch me 'cause I'm, I'm made of fire 
 Who can stop me tonight, I'm hardwired 
 You make me feel invincible 
 I feel, I feel it, invincible 
 I feel, I feel it, invincible 
 Here we go again, I will not give in 
 I've got a reason to fight 
 Every day we choose, we might win or lose 
 This is the dangerous life 
 Hey hey hey, everyday when I wake 
 They say that I'm gone, they say that they've won 
 The bell has been rung, it's over and done 
 Hey hey hey, when I need to be saved 
 They're counting me out but this is my round 
 You in my corner, look at me now 
 Shot like a rocket up into the sky 
 Nothing could stop me tonight 
 You make me feel invincible, earthquake, powerful 
 Just like a tidal wave, you make me brave 
 You're my titanium, fight song, raising up 
 Like a roar of victory in a stadium 
 Who can touch me 'cause I'm, I'm made of fire 
 Who can stop me tonight, I'm hardwired 
 You make me feel invincible 
 I feel, I feel it, invincible 
 I feel, I feel it, invincible 
 You make me feel invincible 
 You make me feel invincible 
 Shot like a rocket up into the sky 
 Not gonna stop, invincible 
 Feel invincible, earthquake, powerful 
 Just like a tidal wave, you make me brave 
 You're my titanium, fight song, raising up 
 Like a roar of victory in a stadium (Invincible) 
 You make me feel invincible, earthquake, powerful 
 Just like a tidal wave, you make me brave (Invincible) 
 You're my titanium, fight song, raising up 
 Like a roar of victory in a stadium 
 Who can touch me 'cause I'm, I'm made of fire 
 Who can stop me tonight, I'm hardwired 
 You make me feel invincible 
 I feel, I feel it, invincible 
 I feel, I feel it, invincible

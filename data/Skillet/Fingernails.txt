Never reaching what I want to reach 
 Never being who I want to be 
 Blaming me when I fall and fail 
 All my dreams splintering, under my fingernails 
 Under my fingernails 
 I'm empty, lonely and accused 
 Accused without a word 
 My fingernails, are chipping down, from clawing in the dirt 
 I'm so lost, lost and confused 
 I threw it all away 
 How can I, be beautiful, when I am so afraid! 
 Never reaching what I want to reach 
 Never being who I want to be 
 Blaming me when I fall and fail 
 All my dreams splintering, under my fingernails 
 All my dreams out of reach, under my fingernails 
 I watch it all slip through my hands 
 My brokenness revealed 
 I'm so proud, I'm so proud, I'm crying to be filled 
 I'm killing, distroying the pain, that's killing me away 
 I've got to live, I've got to love, like I am unafraid 
 Never reaching what I want to reach 
 Never being who I want to be 
 Blaming me when I fall and fail 
 All my dreams splintering, under my fingernails 
 Never reaching what I want to reach 
 Never being who I want to be 
 Blaming me when I fall and fail 
 All my dreams splintering, under my fingernails 
 All my dreams out of reach, under my fingernails 
 I'm wasting, wasting every moment 
 I want to be tasting, tasting every moment with you 
 I'm suffering, I'm bleeding, on my knees 
 Who's gonna save me 
 Suffering, bleeding 
 Save me from this pit of frailty 
 Never reaching what I want to reach! 
 Never being who I want to be 
 Blaming me when I fall and fail 
 All my dreams splintering, under my fingernails 
 Never reaching what I want to reach 
 Never being who I want to be 
 Blaming me when I fall and fail 
 All my dreams splintering, under my fingernails 
 All my dreams out of reach, under my fingernails 
 Never reaching me!

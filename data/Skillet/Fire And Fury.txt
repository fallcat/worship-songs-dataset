Every brick and every stone 
 Of the world we made 
 Will come undone if I... 
 If I can feel you here with me, wo-ooah 
 In my sleep, I call your name 
 But when I wake 
 Need to touch your face, 'cause I... 
 I need to feel you here with me, wo-ooah 
 You can stop the aching 
 'Cause you're the one I need 
 I will burn, I will burn for you 
 With fire and fury, fire and fury 
 My heart hurts, my heart hurts for you 
 Your love burns within me 
 With fire and fury 
 Whoa 
 If I freeze, you are the flame 
 You melt my heart 
 I'm washed in your rain, I know 
 You always have the best of me, wo-ooah 
 Destiny's got a hold me 
 Guess I never knew love like 
 Love knows me, 'cause I 
 I need to feel you here with me 
 I will burn, I will burn for you 
 With fire and fury, fire and fury 
 My heart hurts, my heart hurts for you 
 Your love burns within me 
 With fire and fury 
 Whoa 
 Let it all fall down to dust 
 Can't break the two of us 
 We are safe in the strength of love! 
 You can stop the aching 
 'Cause you're the one I need! 
 I will burn, I will burn for you 
 With fire and fury, fire and fury 
 My heart hurts, my heart hurts for you 
 Your love burns within me 
 It burns, it burns, it burns, it burns! 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 Your love burns within me 
 With fire and fury 
 Whoa

Forgive me now, 'cause I, 
 Have been unfaithful; 
 Don't ask me why, 'cause I don't know; 
 So many times I've tried, 
 But was unable; 
 This heart belongs to You alone... 
 Now I'm in our secret place, 
 Alone in Your embrace, 
 Where all my wrongs have been erased; 
 You have forgiven, 
 All the promises and lies, 
 All the times I compromised, 
 All the times You were denied, 
 You have forgiven... 
 Forgive me, I'm ashamed, 
 I've loved another; 
 I can't explain, 'cause I don't know; 
 No one can take Your place, 
 And there is no other, 
 Forever Yours and Yours alone... 
 Now I'm in our secret place, 
 Alone in Your embrace, 
 Where all my wrongs have been erased; 
 You have forgiven, 
 All the promises and lies, 
 All the times I compromised, 
 All the times You were denied, 
 You have forgiven... 
 I get down on my knees, 
 Feel Your love wash over me, 
 There will never be another; 
 You're the only One forever, 
 And You know I'm Yours alone... 
 I'm in our secret place, 
 Alone in Your embrace, 
 Where all my wrongs have been erased; 
 You have forgiven, 
 All the promises and lies, 
 All the times I compromised, 
 All the times You were denied, 
 You have forgiven... 
 You have forgiven... 
 Forgiven... 
 (Forgiven)

I recall going madly in love with You 
 And I remember this, how could I forget 
 Regret is a needle in my neck 
 It's slowly filling me with poison 
 Spreading to my chest 
 Take my pain and numb me from this 
 Why do I have to beg 
 When all that's left is a memory 
 Forsaken 
 Why do I have to beg 
 When all that's left is a memory 
 Forsaken 
 I recall pledging my sole devotion to You 
 It reminds me how now I'm on my knees 
 My guilt consumes, lost the will in me 
 Wasting away before You 
 Hold me closer please 
 Take my pain and numb me from this 
 Why do I have to beg 
 When all that's left is a memory 
 Forsaken 
 Why do I have to beg 
 When all that's left is a memory 
 Forsaken 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Look at me 
 Forsake 
 You break me 
 Forsake 
 You break me 
 Your breaking me! 
 I recall going madly in love with You 
 And I remember this 
 Tell me 
 Why do I have to beg 
 When all that's left is a memory 
 Forsaken 
 Why do I have to beg 
 When all that's left is a memory 
 Forsaken 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Forsaken 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Tell me why 
 Why 
 Why 
 Why

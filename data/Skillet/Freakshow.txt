Circus barker: 
 Step right up! Ladies and gentlemen! 
 Come and see 
 Things your eyes won't believe! 
 Some say they are aliens, 
 Some say they are stranger! 
 Some say they are not of this world! 
 We will not conform to the masses 
 Whether they scorn, 
 Or whether they attack us 
 Come one, come all! 
 Welcome! To the freak show! 
 Welcome to the freak show, 
 Step up, status quo 
 Hope you enjoy the ride! 
 Welcome to the freak show, 
 We got horns and halos 
 We ain't afraid, 
 And we ain't buying the lie 
 Eat it, drink it, think it, be it, breathe it 
 Guess you don't even know who I am 
 I don't believe it, need it, 
 See it, feed it, breed it 
 Time to make my final stand! 
 Welcome to the freakshow! 
 This is where the freaks go! 
 This is the the place that they 
 Can never take away! 
 Welcome to the freakshow! 
 We don't ever need, no! 
 One to tell us who to be, how to think 
 I don't care what they believe 
 Oh, oh, oh, welcome to the freakshow! 
 Welcome to the outcast, 
 Take a step across the tracks 
 We ain't got nothing to prove 
 Don't need your smiley face, 
 Don't need your hand to shake 
 'Cause it's my life to live 
 And I ain't living for you 
 Eat it, drink it, think it, be it, breathe it 
 Guess you don't even know who I am 
 I don't believe it, need it, 
 See it, feed it, breed it 
 Time to make my final stand! 
 Welcome to the freakshow! 
 This is where the freaks go! 
 This is the the place that they 
 Can never take away! 
 Welcome to the freakshow! 
 We don't ever need, no! 
 One to tell us who to be, how to think 
 I don't care what they believe 
 Oh, oh, oh, welcome to the freakshow! 
 I'm a freak, naturally, 
 Just how I want to be 
 You're a freak, just like me 
 I'm a freak, naturally, 
 Just how I want to be 
 You're a freak, just like me! 
 Welcome to the freakshow! 
 This is where the freaks go! 
 This is the the place, that they 
 Can never take away! 
 Welcome to the freakshow! 
 We don't ever need, no! 
 One to tell us who to be, how to think 
 I don't care what they believe 
 Freakshow! 
 Freakshow! 
 The place that they can never take away! 
 Freakshow! 
 Freakshow! 
 The place that they can never take away! 
 Oh, oh, oh, welcome to the freakshow! 
 Oh, oh, oh, welcome to the freakshow!

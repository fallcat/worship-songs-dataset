I'm sitting with my heart out on the table 
 I'm doing a face to face with God 
 He picked up my heart and said, 
 What you want me to do with this? 
 I just blinked my eyes no smile, no laugh, no tears 
 No shrugging my shoulders 
 It crossed my mind, Yeah I got an idea 
 You could take my heart and put it in a padlocked box 
 What if they grab too hard or smash it, or throw it down 
 I'm scared of being hurt, I just want to live, live a happy life! 
 You want to, you want to 
 Soak my heart in gasoline 
 Light a match and consume me 
 Soak my pride in gasoline 
 All of you and none of me 
 I was reminded my heart reeks of gasoline 
 It bears the mark of a slave committed to life 
 Anyone who wants it 
 Will have to grab it from a real big God 
 Try to touch me, 
 You'll be consumed, you'll be consumed 
 I want to, I want to 
 I'm sitting here with my heart out on the table 
 Next to a bloody mess that was once a man's heart 
 I looked at God and said, What do you want me to do with this? 
 He said, Already done, already done, that heart was Jesus

When all you got are broken dreams 
 Just need a second chance 
 And everything you wanna be 
 Gets taken from your hands 
 We hold on to each other 
 All we have is all we need 
 'Cause one way or another 
 We always make it, you and me 
 This life could almost kill ya 
 When you're trying to survive 
 It's good to be here with ya 
 And it's good to be alive 
 It's good to be alive 
 I was lost and I was gone 
 I was almost dead inside 
 You and me against the world 
 It's a beautiful night 
 It's good to be alive 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 It's good to be alive 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 Driving down this highway 
 Soaking up the sun 
 Got miles to go before we get home 
 And the journey's just begun 
 We hold on to each other 
 You are everything I need 
 (We hold on to each other) 
 You feel like forever 
 You're the second chance for me 
 This life could almost kill ya 
 When you're trying to survive 
 It's good to be here with ya 
 And it's good to be alive 
 It's good to be alive 
 I was lost and I was gone 
 I was almost dead inside 
 You and me against the world 
 It's a beautiful night 
 It's good to be alive 
 It's a beautiful night, yes alright 
 It's good to be alive 
 This life could almost kill ya 
 When you're trying to survive 
 It's good to be alive 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 It's good to be alive 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 (It's good to be alive) 
 And its good to be alive 
 It's good to be alive 
 I was lost and I was gone 
 I was almost dead inside 
 You and me against the world 
 It's a beautiful night 
 It's good to be alive 
 It's a beautiful night, yes alright 
 It's good to be alive 
 Despair, you come to me 
 With your poison and your misery 
 Oh, oh, death, you come to sting 
 With your poison and your misery 
 (Death, death, death, death) 
 Death surrounds me, sing it to me softly 
 (Death) Death the shadow spreads its wings around me 
 (Death, death, calling, calling me to come and) 
 In the night, close your eyes, calling me to come and 
 This is how it feels when you're bent and broken 
 This is how it feels when your dignity's stolen 
 (Death surrounds me, sing it to me softly) 
 (Death, death, calling, calling me to come and) 
 In the night, close your eyes, calling me to come and 
 I can feel the shadow creeping in my mind! 
 (Death, death!) 
 Don't close your eyes!

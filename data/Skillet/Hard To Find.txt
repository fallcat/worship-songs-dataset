Turned on the TV yesterday 
 So much pain bleeding through, 
 I had to look away 
 But inside me the picture's just the same 
 And every time I open up my eyes, 
 Nothing seems to change 
 It never seems to change 
 You give me faith 
 To believe there's a way 
 To put the past finally 
 Behind me 
 And hope to make it through another night 
 You give me strength, 
 During these dark times, 
 When I'm blind, 
 You are my light 
 When faith is hard to find 
 (And when I fall) 
 When faith is hard to find 
 (Will you still hold on?) 
 Something woke me in the night 
 In the midst of the darkness 
 I recognized the light 
 Now inside me the picture seems so clear 
 All the dying in my broken dreams 
 Is starting to appear 
 Starting to appear 
 You give me faith 
 To believe there's a way 
 To put the past finally 
 Behind me 
 And hope to make it through another night 
 You give me strength, 
 During these dark times, 
 When I'm blind, 
 You are my light 
 When faith is hard to find 
 (Find) 
 When faith is hard to find 
 (Find) 
 If I fall, will You hold on to me? 
 Through it all, promise You won't lose me? 
 These days, hope is hard to come by 
 And tonight I don't know how I can survive 
 You give me faith 
 To believe there's a way 
 To put the past finally 
 Behind me 
 And hope to make it through another night 
 You give me strength, 
 During these dark times, 
 When I'm blind, 
 You are my light 
 When faith is hard to find 
 (And when I fall) 
 When faith is hard to find 
 (Will you still hold on?) 
 You give me faith 
 To believe there's a way 
 To put the past finally 
 Behind me 
 And hope to make it through another night 
 You give me strength, 
 During these dark times, 
 When I'm blind, 
 You are my light 
 When faith is hard to find...

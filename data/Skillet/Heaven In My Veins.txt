I can't escape it 
 Help but celebrate it 
 Brace before I get the shakes 
 You're like a drug and 
 All I'm thinking of is 
 How to get another taste 
 And I was born for this 
 And I was born for this 
 Yeah I need it, yeah I need it, yeah I need it in my veins 
 Yeah I need it, yeah I need it, Heaven in my veins 
 Divinity appeals to my need 
 To feed my veins with life 
 I cry to God to feel that every nature 
 Sink into this piece of life 
 And I was born for this 
 And I was born for this 
 And I was born for this 
 And I was born for this 
 Yeah I need it, yeah I need it, yeah I need it in my veins 
 Yeah I need it, yeah I need it, Heaven in my veins 
 Now let me go 
 Fly higher and higher 
 I lose control 
 All of me into you 
 Less of me, all of you

Am I a man who knows how to love 
 When you hate what you fear the most 
 I'll wash your feet as you spit in my face 
 Hey you, I love your soul 
 I"m gonna love when you hate 
 You can't outrun or escape this liquid 
 My life poured out like water 
 I'm gonna drown you with maddening forgiveness 
 Hey you, I love your soul 
 Chorus: I can't depend on your hate to define my love 
 Am I strong enough to love your soul 
 Love doesn't care to receive what it gives 
 Bleeding compassion to extreme 
 Love stretches out to die for its enemies 
 Hey you, I love your soul 
 2nd Chorus: I can't depend on your hate to define my love 
 Am I strong enough to love your soul 
 No bounds on the deep, no bounds on the wide 
 Am I deep enough to love your soul 
 God I want to swim in the deep of you 
 God in you I'm strong enough, strong enough, strong enough, strong enough 
 (Repeat 2nd chorus)

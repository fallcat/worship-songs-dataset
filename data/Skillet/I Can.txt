Looking on the sad times, the guilt and all the shame 
 I have learned to submit my existing hurts and pains 
 All of the grief I have learned to set aside 
 'Cause I am, I am, I am, I am 
 Feeling under rooted, feeling undermined 
 Can this grace of God cover me this time? 
 And when I feel the pain I know why I feel strange 
 And when I hear the rooster crow I am ashamed 
 Jesus on the cross and this cross upon my back 
 I have learned to submit then I whine about my lack 
 Sometimes I drop my cross deserve a little rest 
 That's when I run to You and I nail Your feet and Your wrist 
 I'm feeling under rooted, feeling undermined 
 Can this grace of God cover me this time? 
 And when I feel the pain I know why I feel strange 
 And when I hear the rooster crow I am ashamed 
 And when I feel the pain I know why I feel strange 
 And when I hear the rooster crow I am ashamed 
 And do You really know my soul, even after I hated You? 
 And do you really know my name, can I really come to You? 
 Are You really more faithful than 
 The changing of the seasons and the morning sun? 
 And do You really know my name, can I really come to You 
 I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can 
 I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I don't care 
 If the rooster crows, if the rooster crows 
 If the rooster crows, if the rooster crows 
 (I can)

Learning again that I am not my own 
 Crawling back to where I belong 
 Caught in between knowing You and trusting me 
 Come on take a ride out of in betweens 
 Now I know, I need You 
 When I can't see, I'll trust You 
 And when I get weak, I trust You 
 And when that I just can't let it go 
 I trust that You are in control 
 Shelter me, so I can find some peace 
 Grabbing hold of You is letting go of me 
 It's easy when I remember 
 I possess all that lays beyond my grasp 
 Your power commands the weight off my back 
 Now I know, I need You 
 When I can't see, I'll trust You 
 And when I get weak, I trust You 
 And when that I just can't let it go 
 I trust that You are in control 
 I trust You, I trust You 
 When I can't see, I'll trust You 
 And when I get weak, I trust You 
 And when that I just can't let it go 
 I trust that You are in control 
 I trust You, I trust You, I trust You 
 I trust that You are in control 
 Now I know I trust You

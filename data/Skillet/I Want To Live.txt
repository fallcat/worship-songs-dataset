In a grave of roses, while the night is closing in 
 My soul is so cold, but I want to live again 
 I know you'll come to me, I wait in misery 
 I want to fight for this, save me from this darkness 
 I reach for the light 
 I want to live my life 
 The choice is mine, I've made up my mind 
 Now, I'm free to start again 
 The way I want to live (to live) and breathe (and breathe) 
 The way I want that's right for me 
 I may not know nothing else 
 But I know this, I want to live 
 All I ever needed was a reason to believe 
 You help me hold on, you ignite the fire in me 
 You always come for me, you know just what I need 
 Don't make me wait for this, save me from this darkness 
 I reach for the light 
 I want to live my life 
 The choice is mine, I've made up my mind 
 Now, I'm free to start again 
 The way I want to live (to live) and breathe (and breathe) 
 The way I want that's right for me 
 I may not know nothing else 
 But I know this, I want to live 
 I'm breathing, still breathing 
 But I can't fight this fear alone 
 This feeling is killing slow 
 But now I know 
 I want to live my life 
 The choice is mine, I've made up my mind 
 Now, I'm free to start again 
 The way I want to live (to live) and breathe (and breathe) 
 The way I want that's right for me 
 I may not know nothing else 
 But I know this, I want to live 
 I want to live 
 I know this, I want to live

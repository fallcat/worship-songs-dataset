You're worth so much 
 It'll never be enough 
 To see what you have to give 
 How beautiful you are 
 Yet seem so far 
 From everything you're wanting to be 
 You're wanting to be 
 Tears falling down again 
 Tears falling down 
 You fall on your knees 
 You beg, you plead 
 Can I be someone else 
 For all the times I hate myself? 
 Your failures devour 
 Your heart in every hour. 
 You're drowning in your imperfection 
 You mean so much 
 That heaven would touch 
 The face of humankind for you 
 How special you are 
 Revel in your day 
 You're fearfully and wonderfully made 
 You're wonderfully made 
 Tears falling down again 
 Come let the healing begin 
 You fall on your knees 
 You beg, you plead 
 Can I be someone else 
 For all the times I hate myself? 
 Your failures devour 
 Your heart in every hour. 
 You're drowning in your imperfection 
 You're worth so much 
 So easily crushed 
 Wanna be like everyone else 
 No one escapes 
 Every breath we take 
 Dealing with our own skeletons, skeletons 
 You fall on your knees 
 You beg, you plead 
 Can I be somebody else 
 For all the times I hate myself? 
 Your failures devour 
 Your heart in every hour. 
 You're drowning in your imperfection 
 Won't you believe, yeah 
 Won't you believe, yeah 
 All the things I see in you 
 You're not the only one 
 You're not the only one 
 Drowning in imperfection

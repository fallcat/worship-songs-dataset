I, I'm invincible 
 I'm indestructible 
 It's my destiny 
 I, I'm invincible 
 I'm unshakable 
 Through the truth in my soul 
 You know you just can't 
 Kill a man when he's dead 
 You know the spirit survives 
 You can't stop the advance 
 Of the kingdom to come 
 You know the truth is alive 
 To be invincible 
 Is unattainable 
 Without sacrifice 
 Feel, feel the birth inside 
 The life that cannot die 
 Are you invincible 
 You know you just can't 
 Kill a man when he's dead 
 You know the spirit survives 
 You can't stop the advance 
 Of the kingdom to come 
 You know the truth is alive 
 Invincible, invincible 
 You know you can't 
 Kill a man when he's dead 
 You know you can't 
 You know you can't 
 You know you can't 
 You know you can't 
 You know you can't 
 You know you just can't 
 Kill a man when he's dead 
 You know the spirit survives 
 You can't stop the advance 
 Of the kingdom to come 
 You know the truth is alive 
 You know you just can't 
 Kill a man when he's dead 
 You know the spirit survives 
 You can't stop the advance 
 Of the kingdom to come 
 You know the truth is alive 
 You know you can't 
 Kill a man when he's dead

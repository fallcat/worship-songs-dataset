Let's get the story straight, 
 You were a poison; 
 You flooded through my veins, 
 You left me broken; 
 You tried to make me think, 
 That the blame was all on me; 
 With the pain you put me through, 
 And now I know that it's not me it's you! 
 It's not me, it's you! 
 Always has been you! 
 All the lies and stupid things you say and do! 
 It's you! 
 It's not me, it's you! 
 All the lies and pain you put me through, 
 I know that it's not me, it's you! 
 You! 
 You! 
 It's not me, it's you! 
 You! 
 So here we go again, 
 The same fight we're always in; 
 I don't care, so why pretend? 
 Wake me when your lecture ends! 
 You tried to make me small, 
 Make me fall, and it's all your fault; 
 With the pain you put me through, 
 And now I know that it's not me, it's you! 
 It's not me, it's you! 
 Always has been you! 
 All the lies and stupid things you say and do! 
 It's you! 
 It's not me, it's you! 
 All the lies and pain you put me through, 
 I know that it's not me, it's you! 
 (Guitar Solo) 
 Let's get the story straight, 
 You were a poison; 
 Flooding through my veins, 
 You're driving me insane; 
 And now you're gone away, 
 I'm no longer choking; 
 From the pain you put me through, 
 And now I know that it's not me it's you! 
 (You!) 
 It's not me, it's you! 
 Always has been you! 
 All the lies and stupid things you say and do! 
 It's you! 
 It's not me, it's you! 
 All the lies and pain you put me through, 
 I know that it's not me, it's you! 
 You! 
 (It's not me, it's you!) 
 You! 
 It's not me, it's... you! 
 (It's not me, it's you!) 
 You! 
 It's not me, it's... you! 
 (It's not me, it's you!) 
 You! 
 It's not me, it's... you! 
 (It's not me, it's you!) 
 You! 
 It's not me, it's you!

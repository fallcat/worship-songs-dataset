Today we live, today we breathe 
 Today we know that we are strong when we are weak 
 Today we trust, we overcome 
 Take every chain that kept us slaves and throw em' off 
 We're not waiting for permission 
 We defy our inhibition 
 Like our middle name is "fearless" 
 Unafraid 
 If we're gonna fly, we fly like eagles 
 Arms out wide 
 If we're gonna fear, we fear no evil 
 We will rise 
 By your power, we will go 
 By your spirit, we are bold 
 If we're gonna stand, we stand as giants 
 If we're gonna walk, we walk as lions 
 We walk as lions 
 Today is ours, it's always been 
 Before we face the fight 
 We know who's gonna win 
 We live by faith and not by sight 
 We don't want safe and quiet 
 We don't wanna run and hide 
 This is not an intermission 
 It's our time, not gonna miss it 
 You've already called us fearless 
 Unafraid 
 If we're gonna fly, we fly like eagles 
 Arms out wide 
 If we're gonna fear, we fear no evil 
 We will rise 
 By your power, we will go 
 By your spirit, we are bold 
 If we're gonna stand, we stand as giants 
 If we're gonna walk, we walk as lions 
 We walk as lions 
 Oh, everywhere we go 
 The battle has been won 
 We know you've gone before us 
 So, we take it hard in faith 
 With every step we take 
 We know we'll rise victorious 
 If we're gonna fly, we fly like eagles 
 Arms out wide 
 If we're gonna fear, we fear no evil 
 We will rise 
 By your power, we will go 
 By your spirit, we are bold 
 If we're gonna stand, we stand as giants 
 If we're gonna walk, we walk as lions 
 We walk as lions

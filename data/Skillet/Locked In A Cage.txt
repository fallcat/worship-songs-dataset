I wanna be locked in a cage 
 I wanna be strapped in a chair 
 I wanna be where you are 
 If my insanity comes 
 Wrapped up inside your... 
 I wanna break my legs 
 In case a thought to escape 
 Keep the hammer out of my reach0 
 If my pounding impulse comes 
 Wrapped up inside your arms 
 Locked up inside you 
 Hold me down 'cause I want to know you 
 You bring calm to my rage 
 You are life and I'm thirsting for you 
 Hold me, hold me locked in a cage 
 I love to be caught by you 
 I wanna be trapped in your arms 
 Your cage is rest to my bones 
 Your cage is peace to my soul 
 Wrapped up inside your arms 
 Locked up inside you 
 Hold me down 'cause I want to know you 
 You bring calm to my rage 
 You are life and I'm thirsting for you 
 Hold me, hold me locked in a cage 
 Wrapped up inside your arms 
 Wrapped up inside your arms 
 I'm inside your arms 
 I'm inside your arms 
 Hold me down 'cause I want to know you 
 You bring calm to my rage 
 You are life and I'm thirsting for you 
 Hold me, hold me locked in a cage 
 Hold me down 'cause I want to know you 
 You bring calm to my rage 
 You are life and I'm thirsting for you 
 Hold me, hold me locked in a cage

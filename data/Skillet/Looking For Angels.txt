Going through this life looking for angels 
 People passing by looking for angels 
 Walk this world alone try to stay on my feet 
 Sometimes crawl, fall 
 But I stand up 'cause I'm afraid to sleep 
 Open my eyes to a new day 
 With all new problems and all new pain 
 All the faces are filled with so much anger 
 Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger 
 After all the wars, after settling the scores 
 At the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers 
 There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear 
 With eyes squinted and fists clenched 
 We reach out for what is dear 
 We want it, we want... We want a reason to live 
 We're on a pilgrimage, a crusade for hope 
 'Cause in our hearts and minds and souls we know 
 We need it, we need... We need more than this 
 Going through this life looking for angels 
 People passing by looking for angels 
 Walking down the streets looking for angels 
 Everyone I meet looking for angels 
 So many nations with so many hungry people 
 So many homeless scrounging around for dirty needles 
 On the rise, teen suicide 
 When will we realize 
 We've been desensitized by the lies of the world 
 We're oppressed and impressed by the greedy 
 Whose hands squeeze the life out of the needy 
 When will we learn that wars, threats, and regrets 
 Are the cause and effect of living in fear 
 Who can help protect the innocence of our children 
 Stolen on the internet with images they can't forget 
 We want it, we want... We want a reason to live 
 We represent a generation 
 That wants to turn back the nation 
 To let love be our light and salvation 
 We need it, we need... We need more than this 
 Going through this life looking for angels 
 People passing by looking for angels 
 Walking down the streets looking for angels 
 Everyone I meet looking for angels 
 I became a savior to some kids I'll never meet 
 Sent a check in the mail to buy them something to eat 
 What will you do to make a difference to make a change 
 What will you do to help someone along the way 
 Just a touch, a smile as you turn the other cheek 
 Pray for your enemies, humble yourself 
 Love's staring back at me 
 In the midst of the most painful faces 
 Angels show up in stranger's places 
 Going through this life looking for angels 
 People passing by looking for angels

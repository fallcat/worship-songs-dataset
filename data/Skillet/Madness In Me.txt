(The madness in me) 
 (The madness in me) 
 (The madness in me) 
 (The madness in me) 
 (The madness in me) 
 Just one spark, is all it takes 
 I tried so hard, but it all goes up in flames 
 This is not the way that I thought 
 I would turn out to be 
 Try to get but all that it got 
 Was more insanity 
 Broken everything that it does, 
 Just going against me 
 I can't get away 
 From the fire that burns inside, consuming 
 I fight to stand up but I can't breathe 
 The voices scream, the enemy 
 Takes over everything 
 This is the madness in me 
 The madness in me! 
 Just one chance, is all it takes 
 Can't change the past, 
 But I can fight to change today 
 This is not the way that I thought 
 I would turn out to be 
 Try to get but all that it got 
 Was more insanity 
 Broken everything that it does, 
 Just going against me 
 Got to get away 
 From the fire that burns inside, consuming 
 I fight to stand up but I can't breathe 
 The voices scream, the enemy 
 Takes over everything 
 This is the madness in me 
 The madness in me! 
 Just one spark, is all it takes... 
 For the fire that burns inside, consuming 
 I fight to stand up but I can't breathe 
 The voices scream, the enemy 
 Takes over everything 
 This is the madness in me! 
 Fire that burns inside, consuming 
 I fight to stand up but I can't breathe 
 The voices scream, the enemy 
 Takes over everything 
 This is the madness in me! 
 The madness in me! 
 This is the madness in ME! 
 The madness in me! 
 Are you far? Am I left to die? 
 Will you come to my rescue? 
 (He was pierced for our rebellion, 
 Crushed for our sins) 
 My heart will burn for you! 
 (He was beaten, so we could be whole) 
 You're keeping me alive... 
 !My heart will burn for you! 
 (He was whipped, so we could be healed) 
 You're keeping me alive... 
 My heart will burn for you! 
 (All of us, like sheep, have strayed away, 
 We have left God's paths to follow our own) 
 It's all I can do... 
 (Yet the Lord laid on Him, the sins of us all...) 
 (The sins of us all...)

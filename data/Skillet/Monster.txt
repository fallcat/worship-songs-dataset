The secret side of me I never let you see 
 I keep it caged but I can't control it 
 So stay away from me; the beast is ugly 
 I feel the rage and I just can't hold it 
 It's scratchin' on the walls 
 (In the closet, in the halls) 
 It comes awake and I can't control it 
 Hidin' under the bed 
 (In my body, in my head) 
 Why won't somebody come and save me from this? 
 Make it end 
 I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster 
 My secret side I keep hid under lock and key 
 I keep it caged but I can't control it 
 'Cause if I let him out 
 (He'll tear me up, break me down) 
 Why won't somebody come and save me from this 
 Make it end 
 I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster 
 It's hidin' in the dark, its teeth are razor sharp 
 There's no escape for me; it wants my soul, it wants my heart 
 No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream 
 Maybe it's inside of me 
 (Stop this monster) 
 I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I'm gonna lose control, it's something radical 
 I must confess that I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster 
 I, I feel like a monster

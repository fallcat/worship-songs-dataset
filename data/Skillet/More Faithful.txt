All the things my feet thought to be firm 
 Are falling with urgency 
 Tearing back my false sense of security 
 Some say things change, nothing stays the same 
 But the sweetness in my ears 
 Safe in your arms speak the words I love to hear 
 You have been more faithful than the morning sun 
 You have been more faithful knowing night will come 
 You have been more faithful than the changing of seasons 
 All the things I thought that I used to know 
 Are falling down again 
 Our disillusionment is how we grow 
 Some say things change, nothing stays the same 
 In a world of inconsistency 
 When everything's a lie, what can cause m heart to believe 
 You have been more faithful than the morning sun 
 You have been more faithful knowing night will come 
 You have been more faithful than the changing of seasons

Your touch, your ways 
 Leave me dumb without reason 
 Your love, my cage 
 My prison so pleasing 
 I spend my days 
 Tangled in thoughts of you 
 Stuck in this place 
 Resigned to be your fool 
 I thirst no longer 
 Drenching my soul 
 Pour out like water 
 You're my only infatuation 
 Don't leave me stranded 
 In my obsession 
 My purpose, my possession 
 Live and die in my obsession 
 My obsession 
 Oh 
 Come down to me 
 Don't ever say that it's over 
 I kiss your feet 
 Worship the air you breathe 
 Your love, my gift 
 You go and I will follow 
 My dream, my wish 
 Don't leave me here so helpless 
 I thirst no longer 
 Drenching my soul 
 Pour out like water 
 You're my only infatuation 
 Don't leave me stranded 
 In my obsession 
 My purpose, my possession 
 Live and die in my obsession 
 My obsession 
 Am I a lunatic? 
 I'm going crazy 
 For just a word from 
 For just a touch from you 
 And I'm exploding like chemicals 
 I'm going crazy, can't get enough [2x] 
 I thirst no longer 
 I thirst, yeah 
 Drenching my soul 
 Drenching, oh 
 I thirst no longer 
 Drenching my soul 
 Pour out like water 
 You're my only infatuation 
 Don't leave me stranded 
 In my obsession 
 My purpose, my possession 
 Live and die in my obsession 
 Oh, oh, oh, my obsession 
 Oh, oh, oh, my obsession 
 My obsession

Who's gonna save my soul? 
 Nothing and nobody but You 
 Who's gonna make me whole? 
 Nothing and nobody but You 
 Can't change me, sway me 
 Don't know what to make of me 
 You've got my devotion, 
 Fanatical though it may be 
 I love Your mind, heart, body and soul 
 You're the only sanctuary that I know 
 I don't need to stare at 
 Stained glass and a steeple 
 I don't need to dress 
 To impress all of the people 
 Don't need no priest, don't need no pew 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 I don't need no other purpose 
 You give me a reason 
 Ain't their business what I wanna believe in 
 You are my priest, You are my truth 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 Who's gonna heal my pain? 
 Nothing makes me feel like You do 
 Who can drive my demons away? 
 Nothing makes me heal like You do 
 I love Your mind, heart, body and soul, 
 You're the only sanctuary that I know 
 I don't need to stare at 
 Stained glass and a steeple 
 I don't need to dress 
 To impress all of the people 
 Don't need no priest, don't need no pew 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 I don't need no other purpose 
 You give me a reason 
 Ain't their business what I wanna believe in 
 You are my priest, You are my truth 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound, 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 Oh oh oh 
 Mind, heart, soul and strength, 
 Belong to You, belong to me 
 Got my devotion 
 I will follow where You lead 
 I won't be told what to feel 
 And how to show 
 My love can't be stopped 
 Love You any way I want 
 I don't need to stare at 
 Stained glass and a steeple 
 I don't need to dress 
 To impress all of the people 
 Don't need no priest, don't need no pew 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 I don't need no other purpose 
 You give me a reason 
 Ain't their business what I wanna believe in 
 You are my priest, You are my truth 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 You are my religion, my religion is You 
 You are my religion, my religion is You

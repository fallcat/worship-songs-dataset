Do you know what it's like when, 
 You're scared to see yourself? 
 Do you know what it's like when, 
 You wish you were someone else? 
 Who didn't need your help to get by; 
 Do you know what it's like, 
 To wanna surrender? 
 I don't wanna feel like this tomorrow, 
 I don't wanna live like this today! 
 Make me feel better! 
 I wanna feel better! 
 Stay with me here now, 
 And never surrender! 
 Do you know what it's like when, 
 You're not who you wanna be? 
 Do you know what it's like to, 
 Be your own worst enemy? 
 Who sees the things in me I can't hide; 
 Do you know what it's like, 
 To wanna surrender? 
 I don't wanna feel like this tomorrow, 
 I don't wanna live like this today! 
 Make me feel better! 
 I wanna feel better! 
 Stay with me here now, 
 And never surrender! 
 Make me feel better, 
 You make me feel better; 
 You make me feel better... 
 Put me back together! 
 I don't wanna feel like this tomorrow, 
 I don't wanna live like this today! 
 Make me feel better! 
 I need to feel better! 
 Stay with me here now, 
 And never surrender! 
 Put me back together! 
 Never surrender! 
 Make me feel better! 
 You make me feel better! 
 Stay with me here now, 
 And never surrender...

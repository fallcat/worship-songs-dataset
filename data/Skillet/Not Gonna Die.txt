Death surrounds 
 My heartbeat's slowing down 
 I won't take this world's abuse 
 I won't give up, I refuse! 
 This is how it feels 
 When you're bent and broken 
 This is how it feels 
 When your dignity's stolen 
 When everything you love is needing 
 You hold on to what you believe in 
 The last thing I heard 
 Is that you'll whisper me goodbye 
 And then I heard you flatline 
 No! We're not gonna die tonight 
 We're gonna stand and fight forever 
 (Don't close your eyes!) 
 No! We're not gonna die tonight 
 We've gotta fight for us together 
 No, we're not gonna die tonight! 
 Break their hold 
 'Cause I won't be controlled 
 They can't keep their chains on me 
 When the truth has set me free 
 This is how it feels 
 When you take your life back 
 This is how it feels 
 When you finally fight back 
 When life pushes me, I push harder 
 What doesn't kill me makes me stronger 
 The last thing I heard 
 Is you whispering goodbye 
 And then I heard you flatline 
 No! We're not gonna die tonight 
 We're gonna stand and fight forever 
 (Don't close your eyes!) 
 No! We're not gonna die tonight 
 We've gotta fight for us together 
 No, we're not gonna die tonight! 
 Don't you give up on me 
 You're everything I need 
 This is how it feels 
 When you take your life back 
 This is how it feels 
 When you fight back! 
 No! We're not gonna die tonight 
 We're gonna stand and fight forever 
 (Don't close your eyes!) 
 No! We're not gonna die tonight 
 We've gotta fight for us together 
 No, we're not gonna die tonight! 
 No, we're not gonna die tonight! 
 Not gonna die! 
 (Not gonna die) 
 Not gonna die! 
 (Not gonna die!) 
 Not gonna die tonight!

In the dark with the music on 
 Wishing I was somewhere else 
 Taking all your anger out on me, somebody help 
 I would rather rot alone 
 Then spend a minute with you 
 I'm gone, I'm gone 
 And you can't stop me from falling apart 
 'Cause my self-destruction is all your fault 
 How could you, how could you, how could you hate me 
 When all I ever wanted to be was you? 
 How could you, how could you, how could you love me 
 When all you ever gave me were open wounds? 
 Downstairs the enemy sleeps 
 Leaving the TV on 
 Watching all the dreams we had turn into static 
 Doesn't matter what I do 
 Nothing's gonna change 
 I'm never good enough 
 And you can't stop me from falling apart 
 'Cause my self-destruction is all your fault 
 How could you, how could you, how could you hate me? 
 When all I ever wanted to be was you? 
 How could you, how could you, how could you love me? 
 When all you ever gave me were open wounds? 
 Tell me why you broke me down and betrayed my trust in you 
 I'm not giving up, giving in when will this war end? 
 When will it end? 
 You can't stop me from falling apart... 
 You can't stop me from falling apart... 
 You can't stop me from falling apart... 
 'Cause my self-destruction is all your fault. 
 How could you, how could you, how could you hate me? 
 When all I ever wanted to be was you? 
 How could you, how could you, how could you love me? 
 When all you ever gave me were open wounds? 
 How could you, how could you, 
 How could you, how could you! 
 All I ever wanted to be was you, 
 All you ever gave me were open wounds!

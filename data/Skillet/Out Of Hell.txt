Oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 I've been down in the dirt, lost for so long 
 And pushed around, beaten down 
 Got nothing left to lose, all hope is gone 
 Got buried deep underground 
 Oh, can you see me? 
 Oh, can you hear me? 
 Can you hear me screaming for you? 
 I'm afraid I'm gonna die down here 
 I can't save, I can't save myself 
 Get me out, get me out of Hell 
 I'm suffocating waiting for you 
 'Cause the angels don't fly down here 
 I need you because no one else 
 Can get me out, get me out of Hell? 
 I can't trust anyone, all that I got 
 Is another scarred, broken heart 
 I've been stabbed in the back, the bleeding won't stop 
 Just another cut in the dark 
 Oh, can you see me? 
 Oh, can you hear me? 
 Can you hear me screaming for you? 
 I'm afraid I'm gonna die down here 
 I can't save, I can't save myself 
 Get me out, get me out of Hell 
 I'm suffocating waiting for you 
 'Cause the angels don't fly down here 
 I need you because no one else 
 Can get me out, get me out of Hell? 
 Can you hear me screaming for you? 
 I'm afraid I'm gonna die down here 
 I can't save, I can't save myself 
 Get me out, get me out 
 Get me out of Hell 
 I'm suffocating waiting for you 
 'Cause the angels don't fly down here 
 I need you because no one else 
 Can get me out, get me out of Hell? 
 Can you hear me? 
 Can you see me? 
 I can feel you now 
 Get me out, get me out of Hell 
 Can you hear me screaming for you? 
 I'm afraid I'm gonna die down here 
 I need you because no one else 
 Can get me out, get me out of Hell?

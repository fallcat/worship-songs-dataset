We take a walk in the garden 
 We share the fruits of life 
 We live beneath this canopy 
 Why did we take that bite? 
 We cover up our shame 
 We walk in black and white 
 We turn this ground for hunger 
 Why did we take that bite? 
 Paint me with an endless sunrise, Paint me 
 Paint me open eyes, Paint me with the color of love 
 You took a walk on the planet 
 You gave us shad and light 
 You create mood and substance 
 How can I can take a bite? 
 Paint me with an endless sunrise, Paint me 
 Paint me open eyes, Paint me with the color of love 
 Paint me, mark me up, 
 In these frail, dot-to-dot lines 
 Color me from one red stream 
 From which all others flow 
 Take my black and white and yellow 
 Brown and pink and pain and sorrow 
 Take my black and white and yellow 
 Brown and pink and hate and sorrow 
 Paint me with an endless sunrise, Paint me 
 Paint me open eyes, Paint me with the color of love

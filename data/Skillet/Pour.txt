Everything I am is resting in my jar 
 Holding nothing back from entering my jar 
 My hopes and dreams I put in my jar 
 You find my jar as beautiful 
 Deep the sorrow and pain I put in my jar 
 Times seem so hard I put them in my jar 
 My violence burns You've consumed my heart 
 Desperation ends with desertion in You 
 A moment of intimacy 
 My life explained and unpronounced 
 Falling at Your feet 
 I kneel perpetually 
 Staring at my jar 
 I proceed to pour it out 
 The loss and gain goes on and on and on... 
 You're in my blood and You're all around 
 Beauty speaks without a sound 
 Raging flood, You're the peace I need 
 Down, pour down (repeat) 
 All my fears and needs I put in my jar 
 I'd give everything to know who You are 
 The open space around Your feet 
 Becomes my resting place, my destiny 
 Staring at my jar, 
 I proceed to pour it out 
 The loss and gain goes on and on and on ... 
 You're in my blood and You're all around 
 Beauty speaks without a sound 
 Raging flood, You're the peace I need 
 Down, pour down (repeat) 
 And all You are, 
 Is all I need 
 You're all I need 
 A moment of intimacy 
 My life explained and unpronounced 
 Falling at Your feet 
 I kneel perpetually 
 Staring at my jar, 
 I proceed to pour it out 
 The loss and gain goes on and on and on... 
 You're in my blood and You're all around 
 Beauty speaks without a sound 
 Raging flood, peace I need 
 Down, pour down (repeat) 
 You're in my blood, in my blood... (keep goin') 
 All you are, is all I need, Yeah it's all I need... Yeah it's all I need

When I was a young boy 
 Saw a vision of your face 
 I made my first promise to you 
 Yeah ya know it took some time 
 But I love you now I realize 
 I am the promise maker 
 I am the promise breaker 
 On the road to faithfulness 
 I sometimes forget your name 
 But I can still see your face 
 And time after time 
 I hear you calling my name 
 I gotta name for me 
 I gotta name for me 
 I gotta name for me 
 I gotta name 
 I am the promise maker 
 I am the promise breaker 
 On my knees for the last time 
 I could rip my heart out everyday 
 I made my last promise to you 
 Yeah I could cry I could cry 
 A million tears a day 
 And all I would hear you 
 All I would hear you say 
 Is you are the promise taker 
 You are the promise taker 
 You are the promise taker 
 Put them in your promise blender 
 You took me 
 And you own me 
 And you bought me 
 And you love me 
 Promise keeper, keeper, keeper

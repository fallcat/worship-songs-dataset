I lie here paralytic inside this soul 
 Screaming for you 'til my throat is numb 
 I wanna break out 
 I need a way out 
 I don't believe that it's gotta be this way 
 The worst is the waiting 
 In this womb I'm suffocating 
 Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen 
 I take you in 
 I've died 
 Rebirthing now 
 I wanna live for love wanna live for you and me 
 Breathe for the first time now 
 I've come alive somehow 
 Rebirthing now 
 I wanna live my life wanna give you everything 
 Breathe for the first time now 
 I've come alive somehow 
 Right now 
 Right now 
 I lie here lifeless in this cocoon 
 Shedding my skin 'cause I'm ready to 
 I wanna break out 
 I found a way out 
 I don't believe that it's gotta be this way 
 The worst is the waiting 
 In this womb I'm suffocating 
 Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen 
 I take you in 
 I've died 
 Rebirthing now 
 I wanna live for love wanna live for you and me 
 Breathe for the first time now 
 I've come alive somehow 
 Rebirthing now 
 I wanna live my life wanna give you everything 
 Breathe for the first time now 
 I've come alive somehow 
 (I came alive somehow) 
 Tell me when I'm gonna live again 
 Tell me when I'm gonna breath you in 
 Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside 
 Tell me when I'm gonna feel alive 
 Tell me when I'm gonna live again 
 Tell me when this fear will end 
 Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside 
 Tell me when I'll feel alive 
 Rebirthing now 
 I wanna live for love wanna live for you and me 
 Breathe for the first time now 
 I've come alive somehow 
 Rebirthing now 
 I wanna live my life wanna give you everything 
 Breathe for the first time now 
 I've come alive somehow 
 (I've come alive somehow) 
 Right now 
 I've come alive somehow 
 Right now 
 I've come alive somehow

Still, soft, quietly spoken voice 
 That persistently calls my name 
 And quickens my heart to come 
 And I come 
 And I rest in the shelter of Your love 
 And I rest in the wonder of Your Grace 
 And I rest in the shelter of Your love 
 And I rest in the wonder of You 
 Embraced in the promise of You 
 Is rest for the weary soul 
 Releasing all that is mine 
 I reach for your 
 And I rest in the shelter of Your love 
 And I rest in the wonder of Your Grace 
 And I rest in the shelter of Your love 
 And I rest in the wonder of You 
 Take all the old and You make it new 
 Everything I give to you 
 You're the hope that can pull me through 
 Hallelujah 
 And I rest in the shelter of Your love 
 And I rest in the wonder of Your Grace 
 And I rest in the shelter of Your love 
 And I rest in the wonder of You

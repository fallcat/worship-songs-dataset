Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 They say Jesus is doing nothing 
 They say evolution took His place 
 There's no God that created the world 
 And no Savior for the human race 
 They say God is powerless 
 He laughs aloud as we cry in pain 
 It's just a part of His sick, sick humor 
 Forcing us to appreciate 
 You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
 You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
 You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
 You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 They say God doesn't even exist 
 We made Him up just to numb our pain 
 They can't believe in a loving God 
 Who doesn't believe in atheists 
 You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
 You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
 You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
 You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 Go, go, go 
 We take too much 
 We take too much 
 We take too much 
 We take too much 
 You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
 You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
 You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
 You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
 You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off 
 You can't infect my mind with your vanity 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off 
 You're rippin' me off

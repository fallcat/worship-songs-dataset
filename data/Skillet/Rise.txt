All I see is shattered pieces 
 I can't keep it hidden like a secret 
 (I can't look away) 
 From all this pain in the world we made 
 Every day you need a bulletproof vest 
 To save yourself from what you could never guess! 
 (Am I safe today?) 
 When I step outside in the wars we wage! 
 Our future's here and now, 
 Here comes the countdown! 
 Sound it off, this is the call! 
 Rise in revolution! 
 It's our time to change it all! 
 Rise in revolution! 
 Unite and fight, to make a better life! 
 Everybody one for all, 
 Sound off, this is the call! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 Rise! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 Rise! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 Like a hand grenade thrown in a hurricane 
 Spinning in chaos trying to escape the flame 
 (Yesterday is gone!) 
 Faster than the blast of a car bomb! 
 And when the scars heal, the pain passes, 
 As hope burns, we rise from the ashes 
 (Darkness fades away!) 
 And the light shines on a brave new day! 
 Our future's here and now, 
 Here comes the countdown! 
 Sound it off, this is the call! 
 Rise in revolution! 
 It's our time to change it all! 
 Rise in revolution! 
 Unite and fight, to make a better life! 
 Everybody one for all, 
 Sound off, this is the call! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 Rise! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 Rise! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 In a world gone mad, 
 (In a place so sad!) 
 Sometime it's crazy (Crazy!) 
 To fight for what you believe! 
 But you can't give up, (No!) 
 If you wanna keep what you love! 
 (Keep what you love...) 
 Keep what you love... 
 (Keep what you love...) 
 Keep what you love... 
 Never give up, No! 
 Rise... 
 (Rise in revolution...) 
 Rise... 
 (Rise in revolution...) 
 Everybody one for all, 
 Sound off, this is the call! 
 Rise! 
 Like we're alive! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 Rise! 
 Make a better life! 
 Tonight, we rise! 
 Rise! 
 (Rise, rise in revolution) 
 (Rise, rise, rise in revolution) 
 (Rise...)

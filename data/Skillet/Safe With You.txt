Learning inside 
 I will be safe with you tonight 
 You cause the smile 
 And the teardrops in my eyes 
 Locked inside your every movement 
 Will I stand or will I fall? 
 Trapped inside of your walls of glory 
 I am just as dead leaves fall 
 Safe with you 
 Safe with you 
 Chaos in my head 
 The whole universe is at rest 
 When I'm in your arms 
 Is when I feel the best 
 Locked inside your creative being 
 Whirling about your unfailing truth 
 Attacked with power by ferocious love 
 Salvation alone belongs to you 
 Safe with you 
 Safe with you 
 Lifting up my voice 
 To the God who really sees 
 The God who is consumed 
 With loving thoughts of me 
 The screaming winds 
 And the crashing of the oceans 
 Shifting sands and the changing of the seasons 
 As I stand in awe and wonder 
 Nothing in the world has prepared me for you! 
 Jesus, Jesus, I'm safe with you

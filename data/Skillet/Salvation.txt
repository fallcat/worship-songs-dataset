All alone, lost in this abyss 
 Crawling in the dark 
 Nothing to wet my longing lips 
 And I wonder where You are 
 (Where you are) 
 Are you far? Will You come to my rescue? 
 Am I left to die? 
 But I can't give up on You! 
 I feel You keeping me alive, 
 You are my salvation! 
 Touch You, taste You, feel You here 
 Oh, oh, yeah! 
 I feel You keeping me alive, 
 You are my salvation! 
 Hold me, heal me, keep me near 
 Oh, oh, yeah! 
 My heart will burn for You, 
 It's all I can do! 
 Salvation! 
 Salvation! 
 You're keeping me alive 
 Salvation! 
 You're keeping me... 
 Salvation! 
 You're keeping me alive 
 Been out from under who I am 
 And who I wanna be 
 Held You tightly in my hand 
 Why are we unraveling? 
 Was it me? Will You come to my rescue? 
 Or did I push too far, 
 When I turned my back on You? 
 I feel You keeping me alive, 
 You are my salvation! 
 Touch You, taste You, feel You here 
 Oh, oh, yeah! 
 I feel You keeping me alive, 
 You are my salvation! 
 Hold me, heal me, keep me near 
 Oh, oh, yeah! 
 My heart will burn for You, 
 It's all I can do! 
 Salvation! 
 Salvation! 
 You're keeping me alive 
 Salvation! 
 Touch You, taste You, feel You, need You 
 Give it all, just to find You 
 Hold me, heal me, I will find You! 
 = Guitar Solo = 
 I feel You keeping me alive, 
 You are my salvation! 
 Touch You, taste You, feel You here 
 Oh, oh, yeah! 
 Our love will never die, 
 You are my salvation! 
 Hold me, heal me, keep me near 
 Oh, oh, yeah! 
 My heart will burn for You, 
 It's all I can do! 
 Salvation! 
 Salvation! 
 Touch You, taste You, feel You, need You 
 Salvation! 
 Salvation!

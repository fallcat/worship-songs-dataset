I ask Him 
 When will I 
 Be free, He 
 Said I am 
 Asking Him 
 When will I 
 Change, He said 
 No matter now 
 No matter now 
 Saturn has a ring around it 
 You can never see it with your eyes 
 Saturn has a ring around it 
 Many moons know this to be true 
 You ask Him 
 How can You 
 Be real, He 
 Said you'll be 
 Knowing Him 
 How you do 
 Now He says 
 Rest in this 
 Rest in this 
 Saturn has a ring around it 
 You can never see it with your eyes 
 Saturn has a ring around it 
 Many moons know this to be true

 Saturn has a ring around it 
 But you can never see it with your eyes 
 Saturn has a ring around it 
 Many moons know this to be 
 Saturn has a ring around it 
 But you can never see it with your eyes 
 Saturn has a ring around it 
 Many moons know this to be 
 Heaven has a ring around it 
 The angels sing a song over you 
 Heaven has a ring around you 
 If you don't see it, know that it's true 
 Heaven has a ring around it 
 The angels sing a song over you 
 Heaven has a ring around you 
 If you don't see it, know that it's true 
 If you don't see it, know that it's true (6 times)

Streets filled with blood, black and red 
 Dreams and hearts that once knew love are cold and dead 
 Breathing rust, it's come to this 
 We burnt to dust, an apocalypse 
 But we could live again if we can find ourselves 
 We are the saviors of the world 
 And I will not be ruled 
 We are kings and conquerors 
 And I won't bow to you 
 They will not control us anymore 
 We will not conform, no, anymore 
 We are the saviors, the saviors 
 The saviors of the world 
 Cities will burn, the end is come 
 Paradise is lost, we wonder what we've done 
 Riches rust 
 The iron fist crashes down on the powerless 
 But hope could live again if we can find ourselves 
 We are the saviors of the world 
 And I will not be ruled 
 We are kings and conquerors 
 And I won't bow to you 
 They will not control us anymore 
 We will not conform, no, anymore 
 We are the saviors, the saviors 
 The saviors of the world 
 We are the saviors of the world 
 And I will not be ruled 
 We are kings and conquerors 
 And I won't bow to you 
 They will not control us anymore 
 We will not conform, no, anymore 
 We are the saviors, the saviors 
 The saviors of the world

Things are changing 
 It seems strange and I need to figure this out 
 You've got your life, I've got mine 
 But you're all I cared about 
 Yesterday we were laughing 
 Today I'm left here asking 
 Where has all the time gone now 
 I'm left alone somehow 
 Growing up and getting older 
 I don't wanna believe it's over 
 Don't say goodbye 
 'Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight 
 'Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I 
 And although we knew 
 This time would come for me and you 
 Don't say anything tonight 
 If you're gonna say goodbye 
 Do you remember, in December 
 How we swore we'd never change 
 Even though you're leaving 
 Our feelings would always stay the same 
 I wish we could be laughing 
 Instead, I'm standing here asking 
 Do we have to end this now? 
 Can we make it last somehow? 
 We both know what we've gotta say, not today 
 'Cause I don't wanna leave this way 
 Don't say goodbye 
 'Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight 
 'Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I 
 And although we knew 
 This time would come for me and you 
 Don't say anything tonight 
 If you're gonna say goodbye 
 And if it's over, it hurts but I'm giving you my word 
 I hope that you're always 
 Happy like we were, happy like we were 
 Don't say goodbye 
 'Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight 
 'Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I 
 And although we knew 
 This time would come for me and you 
 Don't say anything tonight 
 If you're gonna say goodbye 
 Yesterday we were laughing 
 (If you're gonna say goodbye) 
 Today I am left here asking 
 (If you're gonna say goodbye) 
 And although we knew 
 This time would come for me and you 
 Don't say anything tonight 
 If you're gonna say goodbye

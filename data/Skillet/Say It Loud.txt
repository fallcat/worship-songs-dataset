Can't help but speak of what I've seen and heard 
 I understand just what the purpose is 
 Uncover peace, uncover hope for all to see 
 And I can't keep quiet, gotta shout it out to you 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Say it loud, say it loud 
 Say it loud, say it loud 
 Come right away to find the joy I've found 
 Don't hesitate to give up everything 
 Discover peace, discover hope, meaning of life 
 I've got to say it, gotta shout it out to you 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Can't keep it, keep it all to myself 
 Can't hold it, can't hold it down 
 Can't shut it, can't shut it out 
 Can't keep me silent, yeah 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta say it loud 
 Gotta say it loud, gotta shout it out 
 Say it loud, say it loud, shout it out 
 Say it loud, say it loud, shout it out 
 Say it loud, say it loud, shout it out 
 Say it loud, say it loud, shout it out

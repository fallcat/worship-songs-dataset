Hanging on a post 
 In my dirty clothes 
 Try to concentrate on you but 
 I keep forgetting 
 Safe enough to not let go 
 Scared enough to not release 
 Open up to drink the wind 
 You tear me up when You come in yeah 
 Take me down 
 Shake me out 
 Give me a brain 
 That I might know You better 
 2x 
 Hanging in the sun 
 Waiting for the rain 
 Saw a field catche on fire 
 I found myself just watching 
 Safe enough to not let go 
 Scared enough to not release 
 Open up to drink the wind 
 You tear me up when 
 You come in 
 Take me down 
 Shake me out 
 Give me a heart 
 That I might love You better 
 2x 
 Hanging on a post 
 Just next to yours 
 I want to curse and spit 
 I weep out loud at Your mercy 
 Take me down 
 Shake me out 
 Give me a life 
 That I might serve You better 
 3x

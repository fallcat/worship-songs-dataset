I'm done wondering where you've been, all 
 Night long when you're out with your friends, all 
 You say, that the matter's over, 
 But now that chapter's over; 
 I'm done trusting you, it's ended; 
 Even after I catch you red handed; 
 You could've been my only one, 
 But now your chance is gone! 
 You should've! When you could've! 
 You're gonna miss my love, girl; 
 You should, it would have been so good, 
 You should've! When I would've! 
 Now I know I've had enough, 
 Better luck next time, girl, 
 You should, it would have been so good... 
 I'm done chasing you all over, 
 May as well be chasing after thunder; 
 Play hard to get if it makes you happy, 
 For a change now, you can start chasing me; 
 Don't cry, 'cause I ain't your sure thing; 
 It ain't my fault you don't know a good thing, 
 You could've been my only one, 
 But now your chance is gone... 
 You should've! When you could've! 
 You're gonna miss my love, girl; 
 You should, it would have been so good, 
 You should've! When I would've! 
 Now I know I've had enough, 
 Better luck next time, girl, 
 You should, it would have been so good... 
 Don't you understand? 
 Don't wanna be your backup plan; 
 Now I won't be here to clean up when it hits the fan... 
 You tried to keep me on your leash, 
 It's time you started chasing me! 
 I'm done acting like I won't be, 
 Sitting here still wishing you wanted me; 
 Don't say that I never told you, 
 Take some advice from somebody who knows... 
 You should've! When you could've! 
 You're gonna miss my love, girl; 
 You should, it would have been so good, 
 You should've! When I would've! 
 Now I know I've had enough, 
 Better luck next time, girl, 
 You should, it would have been so good! 
 You should've! When you could've! 
 You're gonna miss my love, girl; 
 You should, it would have been... so... good...

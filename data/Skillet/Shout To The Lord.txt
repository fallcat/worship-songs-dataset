My Jesus, my Savior 
 Lord there is none like You 
 All of my days I want to praise 
 The wonders of Your mighty love 
 My comfort, my shelter 
 Tower of refuge and strength 
 So let every breath and all that I am 
 Never cease to worship You 
 Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing 
 Power and majesty praise to the King 
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar 
 At the sound of Your name 
 I sing for joy at the works of Your hands 
 Forever I'll love You; forever I'll stand 
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You 
 My Jesus, my Savior 
 Lord there is none like You 
 All of my days I want to praise 
 The wonders of Your mighty love 
 My comfort, my shelter 
 Tower of refuge and strength 
 So let every breath and all that I am 
 Never cease to worship You

If you're sick 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick of it 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick of it! 
 When everything you do, 
 Don't seem to matter 
 You try but it's no use, 
 Your world is getting blacker 
 When every time you fail has no answer 
 Every empty promise made, 
 Is a reminder 
 No one can make this better, 
 Take control, it's now or never! 
 Are you sick of it? 
 Raise your hands - get rid of it! 
 While there's a fighting chance... 
 Are you over it? 
 Bored to death? 
 Have you had enough regret? 
 Take a stand, raise your hands... 
 If you're sick of it! 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick of it! 
 If you're sick of it! 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick of it! 
 Every single day, I chase my own tail 
 Like a rat inside a maze 
 Gotta get, gotta get, get away 
 I'm running out of time for me to break this 
 I'm tired of feeling 
 Like I'm never gonna make it 
 No one can make this better, 
 Take control, it's now or never! 
 Are you sick of it? 
 Raise your hands - get rid of it! 
 While there's a fighting chance... 
 Are you over it? 
 Bored to death? 
 Have you had enough regret? 
 Take a stand, raise your hands... 
 If you're sick of it! 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick of it! 
 If you're sick of it! 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick 
 If you're sick of it! 
 I'm tired of it 
 I'm over it 
 I'm bored of it 
 Gonna fix this 
 I'm sick of it!

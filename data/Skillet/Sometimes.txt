Sometimes, when I lie, 
 I know you're on to me; 
 Sometimes, I don't mind, 
 How hateful that I can be; 
 Sometimes, I don't try, 
 To make you happy; 
 I don't know why I do, 
 The things I do to you, but... 
 Sometimes, I don't wanna be better; 
 Sometimes, I can't be put back together; 
 Sometimes, I find it hard to believe; 
 There's someone else who could be, 
 Just as messed up as me! 
 Sometimes, don't deny, 
 That everything is wrong; 
 Sometimes, rather die, 
 Than to admit it's my fault; 
 Sometimes, when you cry, 
 I just don't care at all; 
 I don't know why I do, 
 The things I do to you, but... 
 Sometimes, I don't wanna be better; 
 Sometimes, I can't be put back together; 
 Sometimes, I find it hard to believe; 
 There's someone else who could be, 
 Just as messed up as me! 
 I want someone to hurt, 
 Like the way I hurt; 
 It's sick, but it makes me feel better... 
 Sometimes, I can't hide, 
 The demons that I face; 
 Sometimes, don't deny, 
 I'm sometimes sinner, sometimes saint; 
 Sometimes, I don't wanna be better; 
 (Everything is wrong forever!) 
 Sometimes, I can't be put back together; 
 (Sometimes, it's gone forever!) 
 Sometimes, I find it hard to believe; 
 There's someone else who could be, 
 Just as messed up as me! 
 Just as messed up as me!

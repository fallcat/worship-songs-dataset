Here I lie again inside this broken body 
 Wrestle against the tree, my muscles aching 
 To get up now is death, to die is to really live 
 Flesh is restless, twisting, spasms in my back increasing 
 Splinter me, splinter me 
 My heart, my head 
 Splinter me 
 Here I think again to try to solve this puzzle 
 What is not yours I don¹t want, my mind aching 
 To reconstruct my thoughts or let it blow away 
 You are all-knowing, changing, yeah you¹re killing me 
 Splinter me, splinter me 
 My heart, my head 
 Splinter me 
 Jesus whispered softly, Jesus shouted it out 
 His kingdom body coming 
 But we nail him up and hate each other 
 Splinter me, splinter me 
 My broken body 
 Splinter me 
 Splinter me, splinter me 
 My broken body 
 Splinter me

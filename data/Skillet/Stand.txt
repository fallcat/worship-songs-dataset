 My mom has always told me to do what's right 
 To wash behind my ears and try to be polite 
 Because she loves me so 
 Tells me what I need to know 
 Sometimes when I'm playing with a friend or two 
 They're doing things I'm not supposed to do 
 I don't go along 
 Because what they do is wrong 
 Stand (Stand up, stand up) 
 For what you believe in 
 God... (He'll be the One to back you up) 
 He'll stand with you

 Everybody tells you that you gotta be cool 
 Remember what you learned in Sunday school 
 Just check it out... 
 The Bible tells you what it's all about 
 If you have a question, go ask your Dad 
 And he can tell you if the thing is good or bad 
 You'll make his day 
 If you remember what your dad would say 
 Stand (Stand up, stand up) 
 For what you believe in 
 God... (He'll be the One to back you up) 
 He'll stand with you

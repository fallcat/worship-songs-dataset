You spoke a word and life began 
 Told oceans where to start and where to end 
 You set in motion time and space 
 But still You come and You call to me by name 
 But still You come and You call to me by name 
 If You can hold the stars in place 
 You can hold my heart the same 
 Whenever I fall away 
 Whenever I start to break 
 So here I am lifting up my heart 
 To the One who holds the stars 
 The deepest depths to darkest nights 
 Can't separate, can't keep me from Your sight 
 I get so lost, forget my way 
 Still You love and You don't forget my name 
 If You can hold the stars in place 
 You can hold my heart the same 
 Whenever I fall away 
 Whenever I start to break 
 So here I am lifting up my heart 
 If You can calm the raging sea 
 You can calm the storm in me 
 You're never too far away 
 You never show up too late 
 So here I am lifting up my heart 
 To the One who holds the stars 
 Your love has called my name 
 What do I have to fear? 
 What do I have to fear? 
 Your love has called my name 
 What do I have to fear? 
 What do I have to fear? 
 If You can hold the stars in place 
 You can hold my heart the same 
 Whenever I fall away 
 Whenever I start to break 
 So here I am lifting up my heart 
 (Lifting up my heart) 
 If You can calm the raging sea 
 You can calm the storm in me 
 You're never too far away 
 You never show up too late 
 So here I am lifting up my heart 
 To the One who holds the stars 
 You're the One who holds the stars

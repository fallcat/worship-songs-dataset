My skin is my disguise 
 I'm more than a man 
 I smile at my demise 
 Ask who I am 
 More than a man 
 More than a man 
 More than a man 
 More than a man 
 My skin is my disguise 
 I'm more than a man 
 I was sent to rule on Earth 
 Ask who I am 
 I wreck, I wreck, I wreck 
 I wreck with every prayer 
 Ask who I am 
 'Cause I'm stronger, yeah 
 Than the Devil, yeah, yeah 
 'Cause I'm stronger, yeah 
 Than the Devil, yeah, yeah 
 Stronger 
 Stronger 
 The fear tries to take me 
 The flesh tries to pull 
 Blackness all around me 
 But I'm undefeatable 
 My God is strong 
 My God is strong 
 My God is strong 
 My God is strong 
 All creation watches 
 For Him to arrive 
 'Cause I'm stronger, yeah 
 Than the Devil, yeah, yeah 
 'Cause I'm stronger, yeah 
 Than the Devil, yeah 
 'Cause I'm stronger, yeah 
 Than the Devil, yeah, yeah 
 'Cause I'm stronger, yeah

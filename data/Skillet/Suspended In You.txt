Thought You'd put me in a box 
 Thought You'd push me into a clump 
 Make me smaller then I was before 
 Thought you would press me and hold me in 
 Took a step and felt the pressure end 
 Exploding me into open space 
 Now You pull me apart 
 I'm suspended in You 
 Stretch me bigger 
 Reveal Yourself to be 
 The frame that holds me tightly 
 In center pulled 
 Into suspension in the middle of You 
 Let what was hidden be revealed 
 Walls of fear broken wide 
 Infinite Jesus spread all in You 
 Towering over the mountains 
 And stretching to the horizons 
 Gushing with surrender in Your hands 
 Now You pull me apart 
 I'm suspended in You 
 Stretch me bigger 
 Reveal Yourself to be 
 The frame that holds me tightly 
 In center pulled 
 Into suspension in the middle of You 
 (Repeat chorus 4 times) 
 Now you pull me apart 
 Stretch me bigger 
 The frame that holds me tightly 
 In center pulled 
 Into suspension in the middle of you

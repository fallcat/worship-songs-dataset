Take my strength, take my pride, 
 Take my selfishness away 
 Take my rights, take ambition, 
 Capture me, make me a slave 
 Break my walls, break my bones, 
 Break my hardened heart 
 Rip my rule, rip my will, 
 Rip independency apart 
 Breathe Your life, breathe your love, 
 Breathe Your breath and I'm sustained 
 Take my hate, take my hurt, 
 Express healing to my pain 
 Take my flesh in all its arrogance, my stability away 
 Take my life, bring fire, 'til only You remain 
 Laid out on my face (yea) 
 My tongue hanging out to taste (yea) 
 Of You and Your death (yea) 
 And to know Your name (yea) 
 Accept my gifts, take my crowns, 
 I spread them at Your feet 
 When I bleed, I bleed with joy as I taste Your suffering 
 Flood life, flood peace, 
 Speak acceptance to my shame 
 Allow to kneel, allow to praise, 
 Give the right to speak Your name 
 Laid out on my face (yea) 
 My tongue hanging out to taste (yea) 
 Of Your and Your death (yea) 
 And to know Your name (yea) (repeat) 
 Laid out on my face 
 Want to know Your name (repeat)

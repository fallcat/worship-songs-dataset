The fire breathes, the fire breathes 
 It grows and grows and seems to have no end 
 The fire breathes, the fire feeds 
 Search and search, consuming everything it sees 
 It lives inside of me 
 Burning, burning, burning, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It lives inside of me 
 The fire breathes 
 The fire breathes, the fire breathes 
 The beauty in its violence brings me peace 
 The fire breathes, the fire breeds 
 It lives in hearts, causing strength to believe 
 It lives inside of me 
 Burning, burning, burning, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It lives inside of me 
 The fire breathes 
 The fire breathes and I need 
 Life in this dead man to make me free 
 It lives inside of me 
 Burning, burning, burning, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It lives inside of me 
 The fire breathes 
 It lives inside of me 
 Burning, burning, burning, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It lives inside of me 
 The fire breathes 
 The fire breathes 
 The fire breathes 
 The fire breathes 
 The fire breathes

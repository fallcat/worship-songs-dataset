The walls between you and I 
 Always pushing us apart 
 Nothing left but scars fight after fight 
 The space between our calm and rage 
 Started growing shorter 
 Disappearing slowly day after day 
 I was sitting there waiting in my room for you 
 You were waiting for me too 
 And it makes me wonder 
 The older I get 
 Will I get over it? 
 It's been way too long for the times we missed 
 I didn't know then it would hurt like this but I think 
 The older I get 
 Maybe I'll get over it 
 It's been way too long for the times we missed 
 I can't believe it still hurts like this 
 The time between those cutting words 
 Built up our defenses 
 Never made no sense it just made me hurt 
 Do you believe that time heals all wounds? 
 It started getting better 
 But it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you 
 I was sitting there waiting in my room for you 
 You were waiting for me too 
 And it makes me wonder 
 The older I get 
 Will I get over it? 
 It's been way too long for the times we missed 
 I didn't know then it would hurt like this but I think 
 The older I get 
 Maybe I'll get over it 
 It's been way too long for the times we missed 
 I can't believe it still hurts like this 
 What was I waiting for 
 I should've taken less and given you more 
 I should've weathered the storm 
 I need to say so bad 
 What were you waiting for? 
 This could have been the best we ever had 
 The older I get 
 Will I get over it? 
 It's been way too long for the times we missed 
 I didn't know then it would hurt like this but I think 
 The older I get 
 Maybe I'll get over it 
 It's been way too long for the times we missed 
 I can't believe it still hurts like this 
 Hurts like this 
 I'm just getting older 
 I'm not getting over you I'm trying to 
 I wish it didn't hurt like this 
 It's been way too long for the times we missed 
 I can't believe it still hurts like this

 The One who never gives up 
 And You're the One that I need 
 You're the One, You're the One 
 Love me like no other 
 You make it easy for my heart to believe 
 And when I'm drowning 
 You're on the way to rescue me 
 And You're the One that I need 
 The One who makes me complete 
 And You're the One who is strong 
 When I am crying and weak 
 And You're the One that I love 
 The One who never gives up 
 And You're the One that I need 
 You're the One, You're the One 
 Hey, yeah, hey, You're the One 
 Hey, yeah, hey, You're the One

 I've never needed how I'm needing now 
 Hey, yeah, hey, You're the One

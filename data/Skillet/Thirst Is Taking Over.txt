You alone are what my soul needs 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 The thirst is taking over 
 Hold me down, hold me down 
 Drip it on my tongue 
 And my convultions stop 
 Thirst for love, thirst for your love 
 I could swallow, your beauty whole 
 You alone are what my soul needs 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 Running out, time's running out 
 Searching for the one, who can conquer me 
 I'm gonna scream aloud, throw it down 
 Crash in the sweet obsession of You 
 I'm gonna swim and drown in the wake of You 
 You alone are what my soul needs 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 The thirst is taking over 
 I wanna taste it 
 I need to taste it 
 Deep in the Savior's arms 
 You alone are what my soul needs 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 I wanna drink You in 
 I am drinking You in 
 I wanna drink You in 
 Hardly breathe I'm in urgent need 
 You know the thirst is taking over 
 The thirst is taking over 
 I wanna taste it 
 I need to taste it 
 Deep in my Savior's arms

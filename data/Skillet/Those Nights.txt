I remember when we used to laugh about nothing at all 
 It was better than going mad 
 From trying to solve all the problems we're going through 
 Forget 'em all 
 'Cause on those nights we would stand and never fall 
 Together we faced it all 
 Remember when we'd 
 Stay up late and we'd talk all night 
 In a dark room lit by the TV light 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 We'd listen to the radio play all night 
 Didn't want to go home to another fight 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 I remember when we used to drive anywhere but here 
 As long as we'd forget our lives 
 We were so young and confused 
 That we didn't know to laugh or cry 
 Those nights were ours 
 They will live and never die 
 Together we'd stand forever 
 Remember when we'd 
 Stay up late and we'd talk all night 
 In a dark room lit by the TV light 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 We'd listen to the radio play all night 
 Didn't want to go home to another fight 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 Those nights belong to us 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 There's nothing wrong with us 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 Those nights belong to us 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 I remember when we used to laugh 
 And now I wish those nights would last 
 Stay up late and we'd talk all night 
 In a dark room lit by the TV light 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 We'd listen to the radio play all night 
 Didn't want to go home to another fight 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 Stay up late and we'd talk all night 
 In a dark room lit by the TV light 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 We'd listen to the radio play all night 
 Didn't want to go home to another fight 
 Through all the hard times in my life 
 Those nights kept me alive 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 Those nights belong to us 
 O-oh, o-oh 
 There's nothing wrong

I'm undefeated 
 Hands on my neck, foot on my back 
 Closing in from every side 
 Bleeding me dry, I'm fading fast 
 Left for dead but I will rise up on my own 
 I could make it alone, I got all that I need to survive 
 (All that I need to survive) 
 Through the sweat and the blood, I know what I'm made of 
 It's the hunger that keeps me alive 
 This time, I'm coming like a hurricane, this time 
 I came to fight for the love of the game, unstoppable 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 I, I, I know I can beat it 
 Won't give up 'cause I believe it 
 Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 Here at the edge losing my ground 
 Stare into the great divide 
 Pushing me over, pulling me down 
 Almost dead, but I will rise up on my own 
 No, I'm never alone and it's all that I need to survive 
 (All that I need to survive) 
 Through the sweat and the blood, if I fall, I'll get up 
 It's the hunger that keeps me alive 
 This time, I'm coming like a hurricane, this time 
 I came to fight for the love of the game, unstoppable 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 I, I, I know I can beat it 
 Won't give up 'cause I believe it 
 Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 All the strength that I have, all the life that's left in me 
 I will give every breath to be everything I can be 
 I, I, I'm undefeated 
 I, I, I'm undefeated 
 I came to fight for the love of the game, unstoppable 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 I, I, I know I can beat it 
 Won't give up 'cause I believe it 
 Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated 
 That's why I, I'm undefeated

You burn so bright, I see stars 
 The way that you laugh, it's like a heavenly choir 
 You made me feel invincible 
 When you're with me, I can take on the world 
 You were a comet and I lost it 
 Watching for comets, will I see you again? 
 You burn so bright, you burn me up tonight 
 Say my name, I'll be there 
 I didn't know, you should've said that you cared 
 It's not too late for broken hearts 
 Take my hand, make a wish on a star 
 You were a comet and I lost it 
 Watching for comets, will I see you again? 
 Everybody needs someone but they can't feel like this 
 How can I breathe with this burning in my chest? 
 You were gone so fast, I want you back 
 You were a comet and I lost it 
 (Time to spread my wings and fly) 
 Watching for comets, will I see you again? 
 (Time to fly away so high) 
 Now I see you, I'm frozen in time 
 All your colors burst into life 
 I don't dare close my eyes 
 'Cause a love like this happens once in a lifetime 
 You were a comet and I lost it 
 Watching for comets, will I see you again? 
 Everybody needs someone but they can't feel like this 
 How can I breathe with this burning in my chest? 
 You were gone so fast, I want you back 
 You were a comet and I lost it 
 (Time to spread my wings and fly) 
 Watching for comets, will I see you again? 
 (Time to fly away so high) 
 You burn so bright, you burn me up tonight

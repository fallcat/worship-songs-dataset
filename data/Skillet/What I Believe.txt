The world around me is lost in misery 
 The only good I've got in my life is You 
 No meaning, no other reason 
 When everything feels wrong 
 I feel right with You 
 So madly 
 Desperate deeply 
 Obsessed, Your love 
 Is better than life to me 
 Can I have this moment forever? 
 Take me to the beginning... 
 You are what I believe! 
 I'll live and die for You 
 This is all that I need! 
 When nothing is real You are my truth 
 In the darkness, You shine! 
 Can You keep me safe tonight? 
 When I'm down on my knees, 
 You are what I believe! 
 When we started, wholehearted 
 I never needed anything or anyone else 
 I was broken, You made me whole again 
 The only one I trusted more than myself 
 So madly 
 Desperate deeply 
 I will live for You completely 
 Can I have this moment forever? 
 Take me to the beginning... 
 You are what I believe! 
 I'll live and die for You 
 This is all that I need! 
 When nothing is real You are my truth 
 In the darkness, You shine! 
 Can You keep me safe tonight? 
 When I'm down on my knees, 
 You are what I believe! 
 Believe in Your love, 
 Believe in Your life 
 Believe that You can put me back 
 Together on the inside 
 Chase all the fear away, 
 Everytime I speak Your name 
 Take me, You are what I believe 
 = Violin Solo = 
 You are what I believe! 
 I'll live and die for You 
 This is all that I need! 
 When nothing is real You are my truth 
 In the darkness, You shine! 
 Can You keep me safe tonight? 
 When I'm down on my knees, 
 You are what I believe!

Talking to God 
 Hearing what He wants 
 He moves in violence 
 I stand in silence 
 Who can question You - who can fathom You? 
 In Your presence, who can stand? 
 Worlds spin around and kings crumble down 
 There's no escaping what You've planned 
 Wind approaching - clouds are forming 
 God in His power 
 Is swirling around me 
 Calling me - and You know my name 
 So jump in or be taken - yea I can't 
 Run long enough, or go far enough 
 To escape the screaming rain 
 It's alright 
 It's alright 
 Jump in the whirlwind 
 I'm letting go 
 My world's at stake 
 I want to break 
 Stop the striving 
 Start the dying 
 I'm thrown into it 
 It's so imminent 
 There's no arguing what You say 
 I gotta keep fanning it - I keep fanning it 
 I keep fanning the fire to flame 
 It's alright 
 It's alright 
 Jump in the whirlwind 
 I'm letting go 
 Master and Saviour, Sustainer and Creator 
 You move in power 
 And winds and thunder 
 It's alright 
 It's alright 
 Jump in the whirlwind 
 Letting go 
 Letting go - I'm lettting go

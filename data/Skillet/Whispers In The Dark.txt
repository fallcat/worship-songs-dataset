Despite the lies that you're making 
 Your love is mine for the taking 
 My love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses 
 Despite the lies that you're making 
 Your love is mine for the taking 
 My love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses 
 I will be the one that's gonna hold you 
 I will be the one that you run to 
 My love is a burning, consuming fire 
 No, you'll never be alone 
 When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars 
 Hear the whispers in the dark 
 No, you'll never be alone 
 When darkness comes, you'll know I'm never far 
 Hear the whispers in the dark 
 Whispers in the dark 
 You feel so lonely and ragged 
 You lay here broken and naked 
 My love is just waiting to clothe you in crimson roses 
 I will be the one that's gonna find you 
 I will be the one that's gonna guide you 
 My love is a burning, consuming fire 
 No, you'll never be alone 
 When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars 
 Hear the whispers in the dark 
 No, you'll never be alone 
 When darkness comes, you'll know I'm never far 
 Hear the whispers in the dark 
 No, you'll never be alone 
 When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars 
 Hear the whispers in the dark 
 No, you'll never be alone 
 When darkness comes, you'll know I'm never far 
 Hear the whispers in the dark 
 Whispers in the dark 
 Whispers in the dark 
 Whispers in the dark

As I fall to sleep 
 Will You comfort me? 
 When my heart is weak 
 Will You rescue me? 
 Will You be there 
 As I grow cold? 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 Will You be there? 
 When I'm in retreat, 
 Can I run to You? 
 Will my pain release 
 At Your mercy seat? 
 Will You be there 
 As I grow cold? 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 Will You be there? 
 My heart grows cold. 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 Are You saying so? 
 Oh, I gotta believe it. 
 Are You saying yeah? 
 When Your love comes down, 
 I can rest my eyes. 
 Feel Your grace and power 
 Flood into my life. 
 As my brokenness 
 And Your strength collide, 
 When Your love comes down, 
 Falling down. 
 As I fall to sleep 
 As I fall to sleep 
 Will you be there 
 As I grow cold? 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 Will you be there? 
 My heart grows cold. 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 Will You be there 
 As I grow cold? 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 Will You be there? 
 My heart grows cold. 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 As I grow cold 
 Will You be there? 
 My heart grows cold. 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down? 
 When I'm falling down? 
 Will You be there? 
 My heart grows cold. 
 Will You be there 
 When I'm falling down?

If I wasn't here tomorrow, 
 Would anybody care? 
 If my time was up, I'd wanna know, 
 You were happy I was there; 
 If I wasn't here tomorrow, 
 Would anyone lose sleep? 
 If I wasn't hard and hollow, 
 Then maybe you would miss me... 
 I know I'm a mess and I wanna be someone, 
 Someone that I'd like better; 
 I can never forget, 
 So don't remind me of it forever... 
 What if I just pulled myself together? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 What if I just tried not to remember? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 All the chances that have passed me by, 
 Would it matter if I gave it one more try? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 If I wasn't here tomorrow, 
 Would anybody care? 
 Still stuck inside this sorrow, 
 I got nothin' and going nowhere; 
 I know I'm a mess and I wanna be someone, 
 Someone that I'd like better; 
 I can never forget, 
 So don't remind me of it forever... 
 What if I just pulled myself together? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 What if I just tried not to remember? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 All the chances that have passed me by, 
 Would it matter if I gave it one more try? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 I know I'm a mess and I wanna be someone, 
 Someone that I'd like better; 
 Can you help me forget? 
 Don't wanna feel like this forever... 
 Forever! 
 What if I just pulled myself together? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 What if I just tried not to remember? 
 Would it matter at all? 
 All the chances that have passed me by, 
 Would it matter if I gave it one more try? 
 If I left tomorrow, 
 Would anybody care? 
 Stuck in this sorrow, 
 Going nowhere; 
 All the chances that have passed me by, 
 Would it matter if I gave it one more try? 
 Would it matter at all?

Times are hard, times have changed, don'tcha say? 
 But I keep holding onto you 
 It's hard to keep the faith alive day to day 
 Leanin' on the strength I've found in you 
 You're the hope of all the earth 
 You are my hope 
 You are my strength 
 You're everything, everything I need 
 You are my hope 
 You are my life 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 Far beyond what I can see or comprehend 
 Etching your eternity in me 
 Nations dream and angels sing 'Jesus reigns' 
 And every knee bows down 
 You're the hope of all the earth 
 You are my hope 
 You are my strength 
 You're everything, everything I need 
 You are my hope 
 You are my life 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 Carry on and I sing of how 
 You love and I love you now 
 All the times that I start to sink 
 You come and you rescue me 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 You are my strength 
 You're everything, everything I need 
 You are my hope 
 You are my life 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope 
 You are my strength 
 You're everything, everything I need 
 You are my hope 
 You are my life 
 You are my hope 
 You are my hope

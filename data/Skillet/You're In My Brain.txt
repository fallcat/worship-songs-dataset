It's so urgent; it's so desperate 
 I can feel it in my bones (yeah) 
 To find a shovel and start digging 
 Under the water, bury myself 
 You're in my brain 
 In my brain 
 The life inside is breaking out 
 You're in my brain 
 In my brain 
 The life inside is breaking out 
 It's getting stronger; I can't contain it 
 It's like a fire in my bones (yeah) 
 It's taking over, recreating 
 Transforming my mind (yeah) 
 You're in my brain 
 In my brain 
 The life inside is breaking out 
 You're in my brain 
 In my brain 
 The life inside is breaking out 
 You're in my mind, in my mind 
 Breaking out 
 You're in my brain 
 In my brain 
 The life inside is breaking out 
 You're in my brain 
 In my brain 
 The life inside is breaking out

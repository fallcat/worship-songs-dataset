You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 You wreck me 
 You rule me 
 You turn me upside down (ya know) 
 Your glory 
 Pervades me 
 You conquer without a sound 
 You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 You shake me 
 You break me 
 You make me whole again (ya know) 
 Your nature 
 Unchanging 
 All fails, but You remain 
 You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 And when the ground begins to shake 
 And when my courage starts to fade 
 I let my fears go 
 When You 
 Breathe 
 The lifeless rise up 
 Invade me 
 With violence 
 And heal me 
 You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 You're powerful 
 You're unshakeable 
 You're mighty 
 You're the ultimate powerful

I walk through the desert, hide from the sun 
 All that I desire is You 
 Occasional water, cools my thirst 
 All I that I desire is You 
 I don't want to live dying on the inside 
 I breathe so softly, don't feel too content 
 Apathy whispers and makes me think 
 Am I just another man whose time went fast 
 What does it take to be called great 
 I don't want to live dying on the inside 
 Because Your love is better than life 
 Because Your voice heals me inside 
 Because my soul is satisfied 
 Because Your love keeps me alive 
 I cannot be silent, I'm crying out 
 My soul is cold, my heart is numb 
 I break from my old self and step into You 
 You complete what was never enough 
 I don't want to live dying on the inside 
 Because Your love is better than life 
 Because Your voice heals me inside 
 Because my soul is satisfied 
 Because Your love keeps me alive 
 Keeps me alive with the strength to speak 
 This generation is dying to see 
 Who You are and how You free 
 Come Lord Jesus come 
 I've seen lots of dead men walking around 
 Make my heart, Make my heart alive 
 Because Your love is better than life 
 Because Your voice heals me inside 
 Because my soul is satisfied 
 Because Your love keeps me alive 
 Keeps me alive...

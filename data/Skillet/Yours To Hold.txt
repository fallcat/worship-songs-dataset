I see you standing here 
 But you're so far away 
 Starving for your attention 
 You don't even know my name 
 You're going through so much 
 But I know that I could be the one to hold you 
 Every single day I find it hard to say 
 I could be yours alone 
 You will see someday 
 That all along the way 
 I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold 
 I see you walking by 
 Your hair always hiding your face 
 I wonder why you've been hurting 
 I wish I had some way to say 
 You're going through so much 
 Don't you know that I could be the one to hold you 
 Every single day I find it hard to say 
 I could be yours alone 
 You will see someday 
 That all along the way 
 I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold 
 I'm stretching, but you're just out of reach 
 You should know 
 I'm ready when you're ready for me 
 And I'm waiting for the right time 
 For the day I catch your eye 
 To let you know 
 That I'm yours to hold 
 Every single day I find it hard to say 
 I could be yours alone 
 You will see someday 
 That all along the way 
 I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold 
 Every single day I find it hard to say 
 I could be yours alone 
 You will see someday 
 That all along the way 
 I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold 
 I'm stretching, but you're just out of reach 
 I'm ready when you're ready for me

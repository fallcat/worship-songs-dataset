Celebrate, for the day of the Lord 
 Give thanks, for all that he has done 
 Your struggle, is now finished 
 The battle is fought and the victory is won 
 I'm a winner I'm no longer in the dark 
 No more will I walk around in defeat 
 I will rejoice at all times 
 For I know that my God is with me 
 I win 'cause I'm on the Lord's side 
 And I shout for the victory he provides 
 There's nothing that can turn me back now 
 For I know that my God is with me 
 Special 
 For I wrestle not with weapons of this world 
 But against, principalities 
 For God has overcome and delivered me 
 Victory

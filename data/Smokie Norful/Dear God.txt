It feels so good to make it this far 
 And I didn't think I could take it so long 
 There were days I wanted to quit 
 I said surely this is it but I held on 
 And I watched as so called friends turn and walk away 
 It hurt so much I didn't have words to say 
 But even when my day turns to night and nothin' seems just right 
 Lord, I thank You for, for my life 
 For my life, Lord, I thank You 
 For every victory in You I've seen 
 And all the moments I know it was You who kept me 
 So I thank You for, for my life 
 And I watched you take my family from there to here 
 And when times where a lil' rough, God, I know You were near 
 And the moments I thought I'd fail, I was reminded of your nails 
 So I held on 
 And if I never live to see another day 
 There is nothin' I would change or take away 
 I've had so many ups that they far outweigh my downs 
 Lord, I thank You for my life 
 For my life, Lord, I thank You 
 For every victory in You I've seen 
 And all the moments I know it was You who kept me 
 So I thank You for, for my life 
 I realized some didn't make it 
 I could've been one of the ones who lost my way 
 And there was times, Lord, I knew I almost went crazy 
 But I'm still here with my life 
 For my life, Lord, I thank You 
 For every victory in You I've seen 
 And all the moments I know it was You who kept me 
 So I thank You for, for my life 
 It may not be all that I hope for 
 And every dream has not yet been realized 
 And to see Your face one day, God 
 I know it's all gonna be worth it 
 Yeah, yeah 
 So I thank You, thank You for every mountain, every valley 
 God, everythin' You brought me through, thank You 
 I know, I know it was You 
 Just wanna take the time to say thank You Jesus, for my life

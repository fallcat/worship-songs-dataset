Hey Listen 
 The economy's down 
 Prices seem so high 
 Seems like all I ever do is 
 Try and try (try and try) 
 Tryin' to make ends meet 
 Tryin' to pull my self above 
 So I can see 
 But every now and then it seem so helpeless hopeless 
 But I'm a livin' breathin testimony of what God can do 
 If you hold on long enough 
 He will see you through 
 Even when the enemy says this is it 
 I want to encourage you whatever you do (Whatever you do) 
 Just don't (just don't quit) 
 I've got my own set of challenges yeah yeah yeah 
 And my friendships sometimes they wear a little thin 
 I even began to wonder if my own family is (out on me) 
 I'm tryin' to make sense of my life 
 I'm tryin' to over come all that's not right yeah 
 But sometime you know it seem so helpless hopeless (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh) 
 Even when things don't go your way 
 You gotta hold on to your faith (Oh

 Don't give in ('Cause it's already written yeah) 
 We win in the end (we win in the end) 
 So hold on (even when the devil says to give up and just through in the towel I came to encourage you) 
 Whatever you do (jus don?t)

Um, you been good 
 If I never own a mansion 
 Way out on the hills, I'll never see riches, Lord, I'll serve you still 
 If I lose all my possessions 
 And my health begins to fail 
 I can still say you've been good 
 If I wake up on tomorrow 
 Found that all of my loved ones are gone 
 Look around and see that my friends are few 
 I still keep holding on 
 If I call and there's no answer 
 In the midst of my despair 
 I can still say, Lord, you been good 
 You been good, oh, yeah 
 (Good, um, good) 
 So as long as I live I'll tell the world: God is good, yeah, oh 
 (Good, um, good) 
 I'm so glad to say right now 
 God is good (choir) 
 If I never visit Paris and enjoy that midday sun 
 If I never sail the seven seas 
 Before my work out where is done, oh 
 If I never see the ruins 
 Of that city that they call ancient Rome 
 I'm not worried because I can still say, God, I know that you, you been good 
 Lord, you been good 
 (Good, um, good) 
 As long, as long, as long as I live, I'm going to tell the world that God is good 
 (Lord, you been good) 
 (Good, um, good) 
 God is good 
 Good, um, good 
 Lord, you been good 
 Good, um, good 
 So glad to say God is 
 So glad to say God is 
 So glad to say God is good 
 I'm glad to say you been good 
 Thank you

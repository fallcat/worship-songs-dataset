Jesus cried for my pain 
 Removed agony and strain 
 Lent His ear to my fear 
 There's healing in His tears 
 There's healing in His tears 
 Being both God and man 
 Who better would understand 
 Than the One who comforts me 
 And who died to set me free 
 Jesus cried for my pain 
 Removed agony and strain 
 Lent His ear to my fear 
 There's healing in His tears 
 There's healing in His tears 
 Just like He cried for Lazarus 
 Still today He cares for us 
 And when Jesus feels your pain 
 Nothing in your life remains the same 
 Jesus cried for my pain 
 Removed agony and strain 
 Lent His ear to my fear 
 There's healing in His tears 
 There's healing in His tears 
 Healing, healing 
 Healing, healing, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, healing 
 Oh, oh, healing

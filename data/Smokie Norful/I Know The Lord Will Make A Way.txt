I know the Lord will make a way 
 Yes He will 
 I know the Lord will make a way 
 Yes He will 
 He'll make a way for you 
 He will lead you safely through 
 I know the Lord will make a way 
 Yes, He will 
 I have a Savior who I can tell all my troubles to 
 When I'm burdened and don't know what to do 
 I can go to Him in secret prayer 
 And I can leave all my burdens there 
 I know the Lord will make a way 
 Yes He will, yes, He will, yes He will 
 Yes, He will, yes He will, yes, He will 
 Yes He will, yes, He will, yes He will 
 When I was sick and couldn't get well 
 He healed my body now I can tell 
 I know the Lord will make a way 
 Yes, He will, oh yes, He will 
 When through the storm you're tossed about 
 I know the Lord, He'll bring you out 
 I know the Lord will make a way 
 Oh yes, He will

You can't tell me that the stars won't come out at night 
 No, you can't tell me that the sun will refuse to shine 
 There's nothing you can say or do that will destroy my peace of mind 
 I've tried God for myself and He's with me every time 
 You can't tell me that, that the doctors have a final say 
 No, you can't tell me that the Lord won't make a way 
 There's nothing you can say or do that will take away my faith 
 Ever since I tried the Lord, nothing that can take His place 
 I know too much about Him 
 And there's nothing to make me doubt Him 
 Just as sure as I have life, oh, you can't change my mind 
 Oh, you can't tell me nothing 'cause I know God for myself 
 You can't tell me that, that a baby doesn't cry 
 You can't tell me that June isn't before July 
 There's nothing you can say or do that will change my reality 
 You see, ever since I tried the Lord, I know He's always with me, oh 
 You can't tell me that He won't step in and rescue me 
 You can't tell me that He didn't die just to set me free 
 Don't try convincing me that God isn't everything I need 
 Oh, you see, He's faithful when others are not 
 He's a surest friend I've got 
 I know too much about Him, yeah 
 And there's nothing to make me doubt Him, oh 
 Just as sure as I have life, oh no, you can't change my mind 
 He's come through every time 
 I know too much about Him, oh 
 Oh, and there's nothing that will make me doubt Him 
 You see, I tried him for myself, don't have to ask anybody else 
 Oh, you can't tell me nothing, I know God for myself, yeah 
 Oh, He's proven Himself to be faithful unto me 
 If I'd never had any trials, who knows where I would be 
 I know too much about Him, oh 
 There's nothing that will make me doubt him 
 Just as sure as I have life, oh, nothing will ever change my mind 
 Oh, He's come through every time, every time, every time 
 I know too much about Him, oh 
 There's nothing that will ever make me doubt Him 
 Oh no, God, you've been so good to me, yeah 
 Oh, I tried God for myself and I don't have to ask anybody else 
 Oh, you can't, you can't tell me nothing 
 'Cause I know God, I know God for myself, yeah 
 He's been with me, yeah, oh 
 When I didn't know how I would make it, God 
 You were there, Lord 
 I didn't think I could take it 
 You were there, you were there, you were there 
 Oh, for myself

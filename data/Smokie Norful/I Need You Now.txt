Not a second 
 Or another minute 
 Not an hour 
 Or another day 
 But at this moment with my arms outstretched 
 I need you to make a way 
 As you've done so many times before 
 Through a window or an open door 
 I stretch my hands to you 
 Come rescue me 
 I need you... 
 Right away 
 I need you now 
 I need you now 
 I need you now 
 I need you now 
 Not another second 
 Or another minute 
 Not aother hour of another day 
 But Lord I need you right away 
 If I never needed you before 
 To show up and restore 
 All of the faith that I let slip 
 While I was yet searching the world for more 
 The true best friend I have indeed 
 You're my best friend I know indeed 
 I stretch my hands to thee 
 Come rescue me 
 I need you right away 
 The agony of being alone 
 The fear of doing things on my own 
 The test and trials that come to make me strong 
 The feelings of guilt, hurt, shame, and defeat 
 The way the trials that beat upon me 
 But to know Lord that in you I've got victory 
 I need you now, Lord, I need you now (Oh, wo, wo) 
 I need you right now, right now, right now 
 I need you now 
 Oh not another second 
 Not another minute, Lord 
 Can't wait another day (oh...) 
 Oh Lord, please make a way 
 Oh Lord, Oh Lord, Mmmmm, Yeah

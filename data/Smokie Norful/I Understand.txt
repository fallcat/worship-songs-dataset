Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 It seems like my best just ain't good enough 
 Lord if you hear me, I'm calling you 
 Do you see, do you care all about what I'm going through 
 And then he says, one more day, one more step 
 See I'm preparing you for myself 
 And when you can't hear my voice, please trust my plan 
 I'm the Lord, I see and yes I understand 
 But sometimes I feel like I'm all alone 
 I'm just like a stranger so far from home 
 I feel like I've done all that I can do 
 Please Lord give me strength, I'm just trying to make it through 
 That's when he told me one more day, one more step 
 See I'm preparing you for myself 
 And if you can't hear my voice, please trust my plan 
 I'm the Lord I see you and yes I understand 
 He knows how much we can bear 
 And in the time of trouble he promised he would always be there 
 I understand 
 The Lord is telling you yes I understand 
 I am the Lord I see you and yes I understand 
 I am the Lord I changeth not 
 I won't forget nor have I forgot 
 You see every thing works according to my plan 
 I am God, trust me, I got the whole world in my hand 
 One more day, one more step 
 I'm preparing you all for myself 
 And you can't hear me speaking, just trust my plan 
 I'm the Lord I see you and yes I understand 
 I'm the Lord I see and yes I understand 
 I am the Lord I see what you're going through 
 Every problem, every trial, every burden, every situation 
 I understand, I won't leave you 
 I understand, understand, understand

 Title: 
 I Will Bless The Lord 
 I will bless the Lord, At all times. And his praises shall, remain in my mouth forever. Magnify the Lord, lets exalt his name. And his praises shall, remain in my mouth forever. Echo "And Ever" 
 Though the enemy comes in against me, I know his hands and his shield protects me. Though it get's hard some times I've made up my mind. I will Bless The Lord. Evil is present on every hand, but God is, A present help so I can stand. Strong tower, refuge, my God, I will Bless the Lord. 
 No demon in hell shall prevail against me, promises of God said that he'll deliver me Yes it gets hard sometimes but I maid up my mind, I will Bless the Lord. Evil is present on every hand, but God is, He's a present help so I can stand. Strong tower, refuge, my God, I will. 
 Though I my be cast aside, never will I turn my face from you Lord. You are my refuge and strength. I will bless your Name.

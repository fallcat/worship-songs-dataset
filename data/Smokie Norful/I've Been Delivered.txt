Here we go, it's old school now, get ready! 
 Put your hands together and get ready to give God praise and glory in this place 
 Frustration mounting up on every side 
 Temptation trying to be my guide 
 Heartache has started speaking to me 
 But I declare right now in Jesus' name I'm free 
 Every place that Satan had me bound 
 God has stepped in and turned it all around 
 This one thing I know I'm sure of 
 I know I've been delivered 
 I've been delivered, I've been set free 
 Every chain that the Devil had on me 
 I've been released to walk in full potential 
 Can't hold me down, I'm going to the next level 
 This one thing I know I'm sure of 
 I know I've been delivered 
 Evil mounting up around my life 
 Tried to make me believe that day is now night 
 Trying to make me think that I've run out of time 
 The Devil tried to make me lose my mind 
 But 
 Now clap your hands like you know 
 Is there anybody that can declare that you know that you're delivered tonight 
 I am delivered (7x) 
 Delivered 
 Yes I am

When you cried, when you were sad 
 When you were alone 
 I'm in the middle 
 When you were in need 
 When you couldn't see 
 I'm right there in the middle, in the middle of 
 I was there in the middle of your pain 
 I was there when you didn't know your right from wrong 
 I was there when your friends walked out on you 
 When you searched and found all of your family was gone 
 I was there, I heard every plea 
 I'll come running every time 
 Be strong, I'm right there in the middle, in the middle of

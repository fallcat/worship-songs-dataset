Ooh 
 (This is my testimony) 
 There is nothing, 
 I desire, 
 More than to be, 
 Where you are, 
 'Cause when I'm with you 
 My broken heart 
 Is mended 
 I, Am, Totally, 
 Set Free 
 In the presence of the King 
 There is I desire 
 More than to be just where you are 
 When I'm with you 
 Chains are broken 
 I am totally set free 
 (In the presence of the king) 
 There is nothing more than I desire 
 More than to be just where you are 
 When I'm with you 
 My enemies have to flee 
 I am totally, I'm totally set free 
 When I'm in the presence of the King 
 There is nothing I desire 
 More than to be just where you are 
 When I'm with you 
 Chains are broken 
 I am totally set free (2x) 
 Draw me nearer, 
 (Draw me nearer Jesus, I just wanna be close to you God), 
 I Pray 
 (Let me feel your presence, Let me feel your presence, so that I...) 
 So that I won't go astray 
 When I'm with you 
 Everything is put together 
 I am totally, totally set free 
 In the presence, 
 In the presence of the King 
 I am totally set free 
 In the presence of the King (4x) 
 In the presence of the King!

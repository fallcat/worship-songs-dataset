Spoken: 
 Here we go 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 Oh yeah 
 It's all about You, yeah 
 So many days, in so many ways 
 I took for granted, all You had planted in my life 
 To enjoy, since I was a little bitty boy 
 Now my eyes are open so I can see 
 All You've done for me 
 You've made my life completed 
 Oh what joy to me You bring 
 So forever I lift my voice and sing 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad that I have found 
 The One who turned my life around 
 Made my world a better place to live 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad You came this way 
 Made my darkness turn to day 
 Now it's for You, I will live 
 Whenever I think how good You've been 
 In spite of the sins or all the wrong I've done 
 I can't help but cry and ask Lord why 
 You show me love unconditionally in spite of 
 Now I'm taking this stand 
 Holding up my right hand 
 And for all my days 
 I'll give Your name the praise 
 Oh, what joy to me You bring 
 And forever I lift my voice and sing 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad that I have found 
 The One who turned my life around 
 Made my world a better place to live 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad You came this way 
 Made my darkness turn to day 
 Now it's for You, I will live 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad that I have found 
 The One who turned my life around 
 Made my world a better place to live 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad You came this way 
 Made my darkness turn to day 
 Now it's for You, I will live 
 I live (for You). I breathe (for You) 
 Have my being (for You), all I do is for You 
 I sing (for You), clap my hands (for You) 
 Do my dance (for You), all I do is for You 
 In my home (for You), on my job (for You) 
 In the mall (for You), all I do is for You 
 I sing (for You), do my dance (for You) 
 Lift my hands (for You), all I do is for You 
 Even in my darkest hour 
 You are there to give me power 
 I'm so glad I found me some You 
 I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad 
 Even in my darkest hour 
 You are there to give me power 
 I'm so glad I found me some You 
 Even in my darkest hour 
 You are there to give me power 
 I'm so glad I found me some You 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad that I have found 
 The One who turned my life around 
 Made my world a better place to live 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad You came this way 
 Made my darkness turn to day 
 Now it's for You, I will live 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad that I have found 
 The One who turned my life around 
 Made my world a better place to live 
 It's all about You 
 I'm so glad You came this way 
 Made my darkness turn to day 
 Now it's for You, I will live 
 It's all about You - oh

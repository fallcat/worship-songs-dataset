I was preaching a sermon one Sunday and uh 
 It was about, it was a parable 
 And it was talking about the uh, the disciples and Jesus 
 When they were going through a corn field 
 And they began to pick the corn 
 And the Pharisees, the legalistics of the day, they came 
 And they were chastising them that 
 'Why are you doing this on the Sabbath?' 
 They had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them 
 Jesus was saying, 'Listen, do you, do you not remember that you 
 You, yourself aren't even worthy 
 You guys break unleavened bread on, on the Sabbath 
 And you kill the sacrifice, you clean the sacrifice' 
 They have a need and it's my job and my responsibility 
 To meet their need and I'm at their need 
 I trump the synagogue, I trump the Sabbath 
 I'm lowered of your life, I'm lowered of everything that is you 
 I'm lowered of this, this day, recognize who you're talking to 
 But in the course of the whole thing what I realize is that 
 The dialog was between the Pharisees or the religious leaders of the day 
 Was between the dignitaries, the officials of the Church and Jesus 
 The disciples never uttered a word 
 He literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives 
 Because he stepped in between the law and the people 
 He says, 'No, I'm Grace and because of Me 
 They don't have to defend themselves to you' 
 'I'll do all the talking, My blood will speak through all of eternity 
 I have justified them, even in their wrong, I know that they are wrong 
 I know that they make mistakes, I know that they are not perfect 
 I know that they do things that are not pleasing' 
 'But even in their wrong, My blood will speak on their behalf 
 And I will just', somebody should have shouted right there 
 Because He didn't kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed 
 But he justified you 
 God bless me with this song, it simply speaks the life of that message 
 And I'm just excited to be able to share it with you 
 Hey, justified me, glorified me 
 Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood 
 Go to Calvary, I've been made free 
 Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified 
 Paid a price for my life 
 And all that was wrong, His love made it right 
 Now what greater sign can any man show? 
 That know with his own blood He made me whole 
 He justified me, glorified me 
 Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood 
 Go to calvary, I've been made free 
 Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified 
 If my sins had their way I never would have made it 
 With a debt I just couldn't afford to pay, He came and saved me 
 When the enemy said that I couldn't, God said go ahead 
 Because you're covered by me awesome, awesome powerful blood 
 Though I, I should've been dead and never kept alive 
 God's grace and his mercy were on every side 
 When it looks like I can't, God says I can 
 And he won't let me fall in the enemy's hand 
 Oh, I'm just glad to know that God saved me 
 His grace and his mercy 
 They watched over me all night long 
 If it had not been, if it had not been 
 If it had not been, if it had not been 
 If it had not been for the lord that was on my side 
 Hey, listen I got some testimonies listen 
 Just like Nineveh that was headed for destruction 
 God stepped in and he said 
 (Not guilt) 
 You gonna live and you won't see the day of destruction 
 (Oh oh oh) 
 Just like Daniel who was condemned to the lion's den, God said 
 (Not guilt) 
 You're gonna live 
 (You're gonna live, yeah) 
 Just like David who was dearly beloved inspite of God said 
 (Not guilt) 
 Yeah 
 Hey

 If you be honest with yourself tonight 
 If it hadn't been for the grace of God 
 You would've been, you could've been 
 Yeah, listen, hey

 (God did it) 
 I thought we'd never see the White House but I'm claiming it 
 (God did it)

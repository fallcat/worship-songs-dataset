Spoken: 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 There's something I want to say 
 I'd like to ask you some things 
 About what life has offered you 
 The ice, the cars, those things 
 They really don't mean one thing 
 What does it mean to gain the world 
 And in the end lose your soul 
 I think I ought to let you know 
 That these things don't last for long 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 Show me something greater than love 
 And I'll show you the greatest mistake 
 'Cause love can't be explained 
 You gotta give it everyday 
 Family is all we had 
 And the Lord is truly all we need 
 If it had not been for Him 
 Tell me where would we be 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 You must believe 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 There's just something about the love of Christ 
 'Cause I know He'll give eternal life 
 You will never, never, never, never  know a love like Jesus 
 So I'm crying out, life is not promised 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Your life is not promised 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 You gotta make room for your miracle 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Life is not promised 
 You gotta live today in love 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Love someone, love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 Life's not promised to anyone 
 Live today and love someone 
 Don't live life so critical 
 Make room for your miracle 
 Life's not promised 
 Diamonds and fancy cars 
 They don't compare to the love Christ brings 
 No, no

Your words are more powerful than nature 
 You are stronger than the sea 
 And Your voice resounds like thunder 
 Yet Your Spirit nurtures me 
 You are wise enough to direct me, God 
 And You are holy enough to keep me 
 You are mighty enough to protect me, yeah 
 You are the light that I might see 
 What a mighty God we serve 
 Awesome ruler, God our protector 
 A mighty God we serve 
 Gentle redeemer, mighty is He 
 Your hand is full of mercy 
 And Your strength lifts every weight 
 Your words sip all throughout eternity 
 And Your loves cancels every hate, yeah 
 You are wise enough to direct me, oh God 
 You are holy enough to keep me 
 You are mighty enough to protect me, yes 
 You are the light that I might see 
 What a mighty God we serve 
 Awesome ruler, God our protector 
 A mighty God we serve 
 Gentle redeemer, mighty is He 
 What a mighty God we serve 
 Awesome ruler, God our protector

 Gentle redeemer, mighty is He 
 No weapon formed against me shall prosper 
 As long as God is with me 
 I know that I'm already victorious 
 His power has set me free

I have no sun, no moon, no stars, no clouds 
 No day or night, nothing is right 
 If I don't have you 
 I have no hills, no mountains, no valleys, no plains 
 No plateaus, nothing goes 
 If I don't have you 
 There is no reason any season of the year 
 To live without the one I love 
 And cherish so dear 
 And no amount of anything 
 Can replace the joy you bring 
 I have nothing, if I don't have you 
 There is no joy, no peace, no love for me 
 No one to care unconditionally 
 If I don't have you 
 There's no west, no east 
 No understanding, no peace 
 No one that makes my very heartbeat 
 If I don't have you 
 I have no life, no death, no air to breathe 
 Not even a single thing to be 
 If I don't have you 
 You gave me everything I'd ever need 
 You are the true definement of my destiny 
 Every since you've been a part of my life 
 My whole world has changed 
 You see, there's nothing undone 
 There are no battles unwon 
 No burdens that we cannot overcome 
 You are the beginning, you will surely be the last 
 My whole world starts and ends with you 
 You are the Alpha, you are the Omega 
 There is nothing that can take your place 
 When I think about all you've done for me 
 How you came and made my life complete 
 If it had not been for the Lord on my side 
 Without you Lord I surely would have died 
 I have nothing 
 Absolutely positively nothing 
 I have nothing if I don't have You

As a little boy I used to dream of the big stage 
 Couldn't wait to see my name in lights 
 I had a dream so big, it made a mountain look small 
 Couldn't wait till I had it all 
 The closer I'd get, the more distant I'd feel 
 The more I thought I had, the less it all seemed real 
 Suddenly I found, the only thing for me that counts 
 And I can't imagine my life without you 
 Once in a lifetime you find a love you know is real 
 Once in a lifetime you find something that makes your song live 
 Once in a lifetime you find a friendship that's worth the wait 
 Once in a lifetime you find joy you can't replace 
 I used to think that it was the trophies on my wall 
 Thought if I won then I'd have it all 
 And I couldn't wait till everybody knew my name 
 I had my own idea of fame 
 The closer I'd get, the more distant I'd feel 
 The more I thought I had, the less it all seemed real 
 Suddenly I found, the only thing for me that counts 
 I can't imagine my life without you 
 Once in a lifetime you find a love you can't let go 
 Once in a lifetime you find the purpose to live on 
 Once in a lifetime you find the meaning of your dreams 
 And once in a lifetime you find the one who gives life meaning 
 Once in a lifetime you find a love you know is real 
 Once in a lifetime you find something that makes your song live 
 Once in a lifetime you find a friendship that's worth the wait 
 Once in a lifetime you find joy you can't replace 
 Once in a lifetime I've found the best thing I know 
 Once in lifetime there's no sign of letting go 
 Once in a lifetime I wouldn't change a single thing 
 Once in a lifetime you made my whole world sing 
 I'll never look beyond your love again 
 Because I know what I've found is truth

Come on, everybody 
 It feels like Sunday morning in here 
 Whenever I think of all that He's done for me 
 How He came from heaven and He gave me the victory 
 He's been so good to me, I just can't thank Him enough 
 When I think of His goodness, I just wanna to praise Him 
 If I had ten thousand tongues, I still couldn't tell it all 
 Everytime I stumble, He's there to break my fall 
 He's made a way for me, opened doors I couldn't see 
 When I think of His goodness, I just wanna praise Him 
 (He's been a constant help) 
 He's been a constant help 
 (That's been a constant friend) 
 A constant friend, is He 
 (He's got my every step) 
 He got every one of my footsteps 
 (And yes He'll step right in) 
 If you don't believe all that He's done for me 
 Just look at my praise and you'll be able to see 
 Don't know how you can sit there, I gotta express myself 
 When I think of His goodness, I gotta praise Him 
 Now, this is your final chance to give my God some glory 
 You better stand on your feet and tell the world your story 
 Clap your hands, do your dance and chime, Hallelujah 
 When you think of His goodness, then you'll praise Him 
 (He's been a constant help) 
 He's been a constant help 
 (That's been a constant friend) 
 Took every breath in Him in a time of need 
 (He's got my every step) 
 He's got every one of my footsteps 
 (And yes, He steps right in) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I wonder, I wonder, is there anybody here 
 Who'll help me give God praise 
 I will bless the Lord, at all times 
 His praises shall continually be in my mouth 
 Ah, come on and praise Him 
 (Praise Him)

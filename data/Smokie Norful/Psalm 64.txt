Hear my voice, oh God, in my prayer 
 Preserve my life from fear of the enemy 
 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked 
 From the insurrection of the workers of iniquity 
 Hear my voice, oh God, in my prayer 
 Preserve my life from fear of the enemy 
 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked 
 From the workers of iniquity 
 Hear my voice, oh God, in my prayer 
 Preserve my life from fear of the enemy 
 Oh, hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked 
 From the workers of iniquity, oh 
 Hear my cry, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God 
 And please attend, attend unto my prayers 
 Hear our prayers oh Lord 
 We can't make it without you 
 We need you now 
 Hear my voice, oh God, in my prayer 
 Preserve my life from fear of the enemy, oh 
 Now unto Him who is able 
 To keep me from falling 
 Amen

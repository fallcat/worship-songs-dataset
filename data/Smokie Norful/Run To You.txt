Ooh ooh oh yeah mmmm 
 I know, that when you look at me, there's so much that only you can see 
 But when, you pause and take the time, I know in my heart, you'll find, 
 A little boy who's scared sometimes, who isn't always strong; 
 Know you see the hurt in me, I feel so all alone, 
 I wanna run to you, 
 I wanna run to you 
 Won't you hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm 
 I wanna run to you 
 I wanna run to you 
 Lord please stay, and don't ever take your love away 
 Oh each day, each day I play the role 
 Of someone who's always in control 
 But at night, I come home and turn the key 
 No one's there, seems only you care for me 
 So what's the sense of trying hard to find my dreams? 
 Without you Lord to share it with, 
 Tell me what does it mean? 
 I wanna run to you, 
 Oh, I wanna run to you 
 Oh, hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm 
 I wanna run to you, oh 
 Lord if I come to you, oh 
 Lord please stay, and don't ever take your love away, away 
 Oh, I need you near, I need you near to wipe away my tears 
 To kiss away my fears oh please Lord 
 Know how much, I wanna run to you 
 I wanna run to you 
 Lord, hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm 
 I wanna run to you 
 But if I come to you 
 Lord please stay, don't ever take your love away, please

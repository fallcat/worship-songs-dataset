You know, I was looking at the condition of the world the other day 
 Seems there's too much killing, too much dying, too much pain 
 I don't know about you, but I'm tired 
 Tired of the same old sad song 
 Sittin' at the window of life 
 Watching the world go by 
 Seeing little brothers and sisters 
 With pain and fear in their eyes 
 Wishing I could take them 
 And make them all my own 
 Giving them hope and peace 
 Instead of that same old sad song 
 I will sing unto you a new song, song about love and peace and joy 
 For every man, girl, and boy, and I'm tired about the perils of this life 
 Seems the world is only moaning and groaning, with misery and strife 
 It's the same old sad song, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Saw an old man on the street 
 Hurting and so in need 
 Wish I could take the whole world 
 And place it at his feet 
 I wish I could change his world 
 And give him a brand new talk 
 Giving him health and joy 
 Instead of that same old sad song 
 I will sing unto you a new song, song about love and peace and joy 
 For every man, girl, and boy, and I'm tired about the perils of this life 
 Seems the world is only moaning and groaning, with misery and strife 
 It's the same old sad song, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I will sing a new song, yeah 
 A song for the whole world to see 
 I will lift my voice and cry out 
 Telling them that you're all they need, yeah 
 You give them love, joy, peace 
 A little understanding 
 That will never, ever fade 
 I will sing a new song, a song for the whole world to see hey, yeah 
 Just give Him your burdens, then you can sing a new song 
 Give God your problems, yeah, and you will sing a new song 
 Give Him your heartaches, you will sing a new song 
 Give God your trials, it's the same old sad song, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've had sins 
 And I've had pain 
 My heart has been broken 
 And my life has been strained 
 But in spite of everything I've been through 
 I still gotta say thank you 
 I've been up 
 And I've been down 
 Had my life turn, turn, turn 
 Completely around 
 But in spite of everything I've been through 
 I still I gotta say thank you 
 Thank you Thank you

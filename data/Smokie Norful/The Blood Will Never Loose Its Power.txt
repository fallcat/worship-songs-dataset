In corridors of air the clouds were waiting there 
 They knew that never again the skies would be so blue 
 They took away the sun and with it took the fun 
 It's true, and now there is really nothing I can do 
 So I look outside my window at the sheets of pouring rain 
 And I wonder if the sun will come again 
 But the sun will never shine the way it used to do 
 The clouds won't let it through 
 Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you 
 The clouds won't let it through 
 It wasn't long ago the people that I knew were glad 
 And nothing they ever thought about was sad 
 But since the sun has gone their laughing times are none 
 That's bad, to make them forget the happy times they've had 
 So they look outside their window at the sheets of pouring rain 
 And they wonder if the sun will come again 
 But the sun will never shine the way it used to do 
 The clouds won't let it through 
 Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you 
 The clouds won't let it through

Lord, I lift my hands 
 I extend myself to You 
 With Your arms stretched out wide 
 You pay the price, You bled and died 
 Lord, I lift my hands 
 I extend myself to You, thank you Jesus 
 With Your arms stretched out wide 
 You paid the price, You bled and died 
 Lord, I lift my voice 
 And I praise Your holy name 
 With Your life You saved my soul 
 And with Your power You made me whole 
 Hey now, Lord, here I stand 
 I give my life back to You 
 You've been so good 
 That it's the least that I could do 
 Now everybody that loves God 
 Give Him thanks, give Him glory, give Him praise 
 He deserves it, He's worthy that's the least we can do 
 For all of the wonderful things that He's done for us 
 Come on and help us praise Him 
 Lord, here I stand 
 I give my life back to You 
 You've been so good 
 That it's the least that I could do 
 Here I am, Jesus, take my hands 
 My mind, my body and soul 
 I give You my hands, Lord 
 Hey, use them in Your vinyard, yeah 
 I give You my feet Lord 
 Help me to walk in Your holy ways 
 Please take all of me, Lord 
 Take all of me, all of me Jesus 
 Not just a part, but all of me 
 Please take all of me, Lord 
 Thank You Jesus, take control 
 I give You my heart, Lord 
 Help me to love like You love 
 I give You my soul, Lord 
 You know it all belongs to You, yeah 
 Please take control, Lord 
 Take control of my walk 
 Control of my thoughts 
 Please take control, Lord 
 It's not because of anything that I have 
 Not for fortune or fame, Lord 
 But I praise You because of who You are 
 Your grace and Your mercy, yeah 
 Because of Your love, Jesus 
 You've been so good 
 You've been so good 
 You've been better to me 
 Than I could have been to myself 
 You've been so good 
 You've made a way out of no way 
 You've been so good that it's the least 
 That I could do

God above, I'm in awe 
 Of Your perfect love 
 Humbly I come to Your throne 
 Of grace 
 For a taste of You 
 Jesus Christ, I'm in awe 
 Of Your sacrifice 
 Holy I stand in Your presence here 
 I am near to You 
 I'm praying Lord break me 
 I'm praying Lord take me 
 I'm praying Lord make me 
 All I've failed to be 
 God above, I'm in awe 
 Of Your perfect love 
 Humbly I come to Your throne 
 Of grace 
 For a taste of You 
 Jesus Christ, I'm in awe 
 Of Your sacrifice 
 Holy I stand in Your presence here 
 I am near to You 
 When all around is falling out 
 When I forget what I'm about 
 Sometimes the best that I can do 
 Is to desire to desire You 
 Break my heart, take me Lord 
 Make me whole 
 I need You 
 God above

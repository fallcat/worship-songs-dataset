How lovely is 
 Your dwelling place 
 Oh Lord Almighty, 
 For my soul longs 
 And even faints 
 For You 
 Oh, here my heart 
 Is satisfied (is satisfied) 
 Within Your presence 
 I sing beneath 
 The shadow of 
 Your wings 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 (Than thousands elsewhere) 
 One thing I ask, 
 And I would seek, 
 To see Your beauty 
 To find You in 
 The place Your glory dwells 
 (One thing I ask) 
 One thing I ask 
 And I would seek, 
 To see Your beauty 
 To find You in 
 The place Your glory dwells 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 (Better is one day) 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 (My heart and flesh cry out) 
 My heart and flesh cry out 
 For You, the Living God 
 Your Spirit's water to my soul 
 I've tasted, and I've seen 
 Come once again to me 
 I will draw near to You 
 I will draw near to You 
 To You 
 Better is one day 
 Better is one day 
 Better is one day 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Better is one day in Your house 
 Better is one day in Your courts 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Than thousands elsewhere 
 Yeah, than thousands elsewhere (Yeah) 
 Oh, than thousands elsewhere 
 Oh, than thousands elsewhere

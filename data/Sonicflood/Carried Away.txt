You are the open door to freedom 
 You are the only hope I have 
 The reason in my reason 
 The only thing that lasts 
 How could I begin to settle 
 When all within me longs 
 To step into the shelter 
 Of your everlasting arms 
 I wanna get carried away 
 I wanna get tossed by your waves 
 I don't care where or how deep 
 I'm gonna jump in with both feet 
 I wanna get carried away 
 I wanna get lost in your ways 
 I wanna be held by your truth 
 I wanna behold all of you 
 I'm gonna be all yours today 
 I wanna get carried away 
 You are the wisdom of the ages 
 You are the one who stays the same 
 The power in the wind 
 The scent left by the rain 
 How could I begin to make it 
 If all I had was me 
 Just take me as I am Lord 
 And sweep me out to sea. 
 Some say You're far away 
 But I know You're here with me 
 I could go anywhere 
 And still you'd be there with me 
 I know You're here with me.

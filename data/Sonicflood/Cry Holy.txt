Every sun and moon and star 
 All declaring who you are 
 We fall silent in amazement 
 Every word and deed of man 
 Every sea and grain of sand 
 All creation speaks 
 And now we sing to proclaim your majesty 
 Let the earth rejoice 
 Singing with one voice 
 Let the people cry 
 Holy holy lord 
 Every creature sing 
 Praises to the King 
 All creation cry 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Every song sung on the earth 
 Will never capture all your worth 
 We fall silent in amazement 
 Let every humble heart now see 
 The beauty of your majesty 
 All creation speaks 
 And now we sing to the king above all kings 
 Let the earth rejoice 
 Singing with one voice 
 Let the people cry 
 Holy holy Lord 
 Every creature sing 
 Praises to the King 
 All creation cry 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 All creation proclaims your Majesty 
 Holy is Your name in all the earth 
 All creation proclaims your Majesty 
 And now we sing 
 Let the earth rejoice 
 Singing with one voice 
 Let the people cry 
 Holy holy Lord 
 Every creature sing 
 Praises to the King 
 All creation cry 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord 
 Holy is the Lord

Dear Lord, this pain inside me 
 Tears me apart 
 And Lord the more it hurts 
 The harder my heart 
 Oh, in my darkest hour 
 Your love comes shining through 
 Your word is true and You make all things new 
 And I know You're all I need 
 You say You're here and You calm my fears 
 And I know You'll never leave 
 Dear Lord, my heart is breaking 
 Breaking in two 
 And Lord my spirit's torn and 
 Crushed without You 
 Higher than the stars that shine 
 And deeper than the sea 
 Is my Savior's precious love 
 Your love has set me free 
 Set me free

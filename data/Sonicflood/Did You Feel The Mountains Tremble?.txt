Did you feel the mountains tremble? 
 Did you hear the oceans roar? 
 When the people rose to sing of Jesus Christ the risen one. 
 (Jesus) 
 Did you feel the people tremble? 
 Did you hear the singers roar? 
 When the lost began to sing of Jesus Christ the saving one. 
 And we can see that God you're moving 
 A mighty river through the nations. 
 When young and old return to Jesus. 
 Fling wide you heavenly gates! 
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord! 
 (Prepare the way) 
 Open up the doors 
 Let the music play 
 Let the streets resound with singing 
 Songs that bring Your hope 
 And the songs that bring Your joy 
 Dancers who dance upon injustice 
 Do you feel the darkness tremble? 
 When all the saints join in one song. 
 And all the streams flow in one river 
 To wash away our brokenness 
 And we see that God you're moving 
 A time of jubilee is coming 
 When young and old return to Jesus 
 Fling wide you heavenly gates! 
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord! 
 (Prepare the way) 
 Open up the doors 
 Let the music play 
 Let the streets resound with singing 
 Songs that bring Your hope 
 And the songs that bring Your joy 
 Dancers who dance upon injustice 
 Land of the free 
 Could this be the land of the free? 
 And here we see that God you're moving 
 A time of jubilee is coming 
 When young and old return to Jesus 
 Fling wide you heavenly gates! 
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord! 
 (Prepare the way) 
 Open up the doors 
 Let the music play 
 Let the streets resound with singing 
 Songs that bring Your hope 
 And the songs that bring Your joy 
 Dancers who dance upon injustice

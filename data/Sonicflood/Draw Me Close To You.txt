Draw me close to you. 
 Never let me go. 
 I lay it all down again. 
 To hear you say that I'm your friend. 
 You are my desire. 
 No one else will do. 
 Cause no one else can take the place. 
 To fill the warmth of your embrace. 
 Help me find a way. 
 To bring me back to you. 
 You're all I want. 
 You're all I've ever needed 
 You're all I want. 
 Help me know you are near. 
 Draw me close to you. 
 Never let me go. 
 I lay it all down again. 
 To hear you say that I'm your friend. 
 You are my desire. 
 No one else will do. 
 Cause no one can take the place. 
 To fill the warmth of your embrace. 
 Help me find a way. 
 To bring me back to you. 
 You're all I want. 
 You're all I've ever needed 
 You're all I want. 
 Help me know you are near.

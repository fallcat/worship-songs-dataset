Draw me close to you 
 Never let me go 
 I lay it all down again 
 To hear you say that I'm your friend 
 You are my desire, no one else will do 
 'Cause no one else can take the place 
 To fill the warmth of your embrace 
 Help me find a way to bring me back to you 
 You're all I want 
 You're all I've ever needed 
 You're all I want 
 Help me know you are near 
 Draw me close to you 
 Never let me go 
 I lay it all down again 
 To hear you say that I'm your friend 
 You are my desire, no one else will do 
 'Cause no one else can take the place 
 To fill the warmth of your embrace 
 Help me find a way to bring me back to you 
 You're all I want 
 You're all I've ever needed 
 You're all I want 
 Help me know you are near

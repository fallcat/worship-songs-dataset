The sky will fall 
 The ground will give 
 Through it all You will 
 Be faithful 
 Friends may leave 
 They come and go 
 This I know 
 You will be faithful 
 You will be faithful 
 You will always be the same 
 Your love will never change 
 You are the everlasting 
 I will put my trust in You 
 Forever to be true 
 You are the everlasting 
 You are the everlasting 
 When beauty fades 
 And slips away 
 For all my days You will 
 Be faithful 
 When I breathe 
 My final breath 
 I find my rest in Your 
 Faithfulness 
 When all around us 
 Is falling into waste 
 When the earth is dying 
 You cannot be erased 
 And I don't have to be afraid 
 You're the Alpha and Omega 
 You're forever, everlasting

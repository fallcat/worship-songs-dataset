What to say Lord... it's 
 You who gave me life, and 
 I can't explain just how 
 Much You mean to me now. 
 That You would save me, Lord 
 Give all that I am to you 
 Every day I could be a light 
 That shines Your name 
 Every day Lord 
 I learn to stand upon your word 
 And I pray that I, 
 I might come to know you more 
 And You would guide me in 
 Every single step I take 
 That everyday I could 
 Be a light unto the world 
 Every day, it's You I live for 
 Every day, I'll follow after You 
 Every day, I'll walk with You, my Lord 
 Every day Lord 
 I learn to stand upon your word 
 And I pray that I 
 I might come to know you more 
 And you would guide me in 
 Every single step I take 
 That everyday I could 
 Be a light unto the world 
 Every day, it's You I live for 
 Every day, I'll follow after You 
 Every day, I'll walk with You, my Lord 
 My Lord... my Lord... my Lord 
 It's You I live for every day... 
 It's You I live for every day... 
 It's You I live for every day... my Lord 
 Every day, it's You I live for 
 Every day, I'll follow after You 
 Every day, I'll walk with You, my Lord 
 Every day, it's You I live for 
 Every day, I'll follow after You 
 Every day, I'll walk with You, my Lord 
 My Lord... my Lord... my Lord 
 My Lord... my Lord... my Lord 
 My Lord

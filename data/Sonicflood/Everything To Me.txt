Do I honor You with words 
 Or do I walk a thousand miles 
 To show You what Your worth 
 In all I say in all I do 
 I'm ever short of You 
 With empty hands I come 
 A beggars song I sing to You 
 You are my cup 
 You are my bread 
 You're the spotless lamb 
 The great I am 
 You are my King 
 You are my peace 
 You're the air I breathe 
 You're everything 
 You're everything to me 
 Am I standing only ankle deep 
 Or do I fear the crashing waves 
 Afraid that I may sink 
 Draw me to the deepest place 
 That I might worship You 
 With empty hands I come 
 A beggars song I sing to You 
 You are my cup 
 You are my bread 
 You're the spotless lamb 
 The great I am 
 You are my King 
 You are my peace 
 You're the air I breathe 
 You're everything 
 You are my cup 
 You are my bread 
 You're the spotless lamb 
 The great I am 
 You are my King 
 You are my peace 
 You're the air I breathe 
 You're everything 
 You're everything to me 
 You're everything to me

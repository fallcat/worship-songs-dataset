What if I could be the one 
 Be everything under the sun 
 Someone of great renown 
 A king with the coolest crown 
 Stronger than a superman 
 Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound 
 And you know that I, would really love to 
 Try and be everything to everyone, but I 
 Know better 
 'Cause you're the only one I need to please 
 That really matters 
 There are days I feel the need 
 For something more to feel complete 
 Like a 90 yard field goal 
 To win every superbowl 
 Another feather in my hat 
 But these are the things you said 
 That would never last 
 And you know that I, would really love to 
 Try and 
 Be everything to everyone, but I know better 
 'Cause you're the only one I need to please 
 That really matters

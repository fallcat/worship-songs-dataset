In Your presence there is fullness of life 
 Healing flowing for body soul and mind 
 God of the impossible, God of miracles is here 
 God is here let the broken-hearted rejoice 
 God is here let the sick say I am well 
 God is here let the weak say I am strong 
 God is here 
 In Your presence there is perfect peace 
 And in stillness I behold Your deity 
 God of wonders, God of power is here 
 His wonders to perform 
 Oh His wonders yes His wonders 
 His wonders to perform 
 Oh His wonders yes His wonders 
 His wonders to perform

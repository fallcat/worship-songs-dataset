Wash-n-wear, simplest of things 
 What can make your heart want to sing 
 Like the day - dc came to town 
 You were standing there - didn't care 
 That the rain was pouring down 
 Things are better than they seem 
 There's no ending to the dream 
 We all know that god is good 
 Everything will turn out right 
 As we walk into the light 
 We all know that god is good 
 Nevermind - if it seems surreal 
 Don't get hung up on what you feel 
 In my head - I can hear a tune 
 So much sweeter than a lullaby 
 Sleep tight kids 'cause god is good 
 And 
 Things are better than they seem 
 There's no ending to the dream 
 We all know that god is good 
 Everything will turn out right 
 As we walk into the light 
 We all know that god is good 
 I should choose the words I say 
 And the message I convey 
 I'll make it clear - so don't get me wrong 
 Things are better than they seem 
 There's no ending to the dream 
 We all know that god is good 
 Everything will turn out right 
 As we walk into the light 
 We all know that god is good

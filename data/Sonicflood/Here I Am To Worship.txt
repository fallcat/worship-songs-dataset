Light of the world, 
 You stepped down into darkness. 
 Opened my eyes, 
 Let me see. 
 Beauty that made this heart adore you 
 Hope of a life spent with you 
 And here I am to worship, 
 Here I am to bow down, 
 Here I am to say that you're my God 
 You're altogether lovely, 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 King of all days, 
 Oh, so highly exalted. 
 Glorious in heaven above. 
 Humbly you came 
 To the earth you created 
 All for love's sake became poor. 
 And here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that you're my God 
 You're altogether lovely. 
 Altogether worthy, 
 Altogether wonderful to me. 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 And I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 No, I'll never know how much it cost 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that you're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 And here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that you're my god 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful 
 Wonderful wonderful 
 Yes you are God 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross

I left my house today 
 Thinking about the words we throw 
 Away 
 Things that we shouldn't have said 
 Friends can be hard to find 
 Why do we leave the grace so far 
 Behind 
 Dragging us down instead 
 Here we go again when 
 Break before we bend 
 Thinking it all will mend in time 
 Here we go again 
 Here as we draw up sides 
 Both of us too assured to be 
 Denied 
 Someone will fall behind 
 Do we see 
 When can we cross this line 
 Here we go again we 
 Break before we bend 
 Thinking it all will mend in time 
 Here we go again

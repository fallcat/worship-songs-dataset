My Hero, Zero 
 You're such a funny little Hero 
 But until you came along, we counted on our fingers and toes! 
 Now you're here to stay, but nobody really knows 
 How wonderful you are, 
 Why, you could never reach a star 
 Without you, Zero, my Hero, how wonderful you are 
 How wonderful you are 
 Ya place a Zero after one, and ya got yourself a ten 
 (See how important that is!) 
 When ya run out of digits, you can start all over again 
 (See how convenient that is!) 
 That's why with only ten digits, including Zero 
 You can count as high as you could ever go 
 Forever, to what's infinity 
 No one ever gets there, but you could try! 
 With ten billion Zero's 
 From the Cavemen to the Heroes 
 Who invented you, 
 They counted on their fingers and toes 
 (And maybe some sticks and stones, rocks and bones, and neighbor's toes!) 
 But nobody really knows 
 How wonderful you are, 
 Why you could never reach a star 
 Without you, Zero, my Hero, how wonderful you are 
 How wonderful you are 
 If ya place a Zero after any number, that number goes by ten 
 (See how easy that is!) 
 If ya place two Zero's after any number, and that number goes by a hundred 
 (See how simple that is!) 
 With church, maybe you place six Zero's after a number, 
 And I guess you're goin' flat on the floor! 
 Etcetera, etcetera, add infinitum, 
 Add astra, forever, 
 And ever, with Zero, My Hero, 
 How wonderful you are!

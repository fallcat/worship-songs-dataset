Lord I stand in awe of You 
 'Cause everything I know 
 Fails to compare to 
 You and You alone 
 Taken by Your majesty 
 I am overcome 
 By the power of 
 What Your hand has done (Yeah) 
 I could never quite express 
 The beauty of your holiness 
 You're the Holy One 
 I could never quite define 
 The way You've changed this heart of mine 
 You're the Holy One 
 You're the Holy One 
 You're the Holy One 
 There's no counting all the ways 
 That You have been so true 
 You're faithful to the end 
 You're faithful through and through 
 You are more than wonderful 
 You are everything 
 You mean more than love 
 More than life to me (Yeah) 
 Holy, You are Lord over all the earth 
 Let us see your glory 
 I will lift You up for You loved me first 
 For You are the holy, Holy One, Holy One, Holy One...

Many mighty rivers I have crossed 
 Many barren deserts have I seen 
 And still my heart beats strong 
 For You, Oh Lord 
 For You have been my shelter 
 I all of my need 
 I have come to worship you 
 Oh, and I have come to worship you 
 A willing soul and a thankful heart 
 To find a holy passion just for You 
 And turn away from the things 
 That break your heart 
 And live a life of sacrifice 
 Just for You 
 For only You are worthy 
 Only You are worthy 
 Only You are worthy 
 Of the praise this heart brings

You know who I am inside 
 You know when I lie 
 You can tell when I'm amazed 
 You can see my faith 
 You know when I don't believe 
 You know when I'm free 
 You can tell when I need love 
 You know I'm in need 
 Love, I need love 
 You are love 
 I need You 
 Love, You are love 
 I need love 
 I need You 
 You know of my deepest fear 
 You know when I'm scared 
 You can read my empty page 
 You can feel my rage 
 You're aware of when I dream 
 You see when I bleed 
 You can tell when I need love 
 You know I'm in need 
 I know we need You, Father 
 Much more than any other 
 Your love brings us together 
 We need You, we need You 
 Love, we need love 
 You are love 
 We need You 
 Love, You are love 
 We need love 
 We need You I need You. 
 You know who I am inside...

Sonicflood album version: 
 Bop bop bop do do do 
 Bop bop bop 
 Bop bop bop 
 Bop bop bop 
 Bop bop bop…. 
 In the secret in the quiet place 
 In the stillness, You are there 
 In the secret in the quiet hour 
 I wait only for You 
 'Cause I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 I am reaching for the highest goal 
 That I might receive the prize 
 Pressing onward pushing every 
 Hindrance aside 
 Out of my way 
 Because I want to know You more 
 More and more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more (more and more) 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more (more and more) 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more (more, more) 
 I want to know You (I want to know You) 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more (more and more) 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 Another version: 
 Bop bop bop... 
 Do do do…. 
 Yeah 
 In the secret, in the quiet place 
 In the stillness, You are there 
 In the secret, in the quiet hour 
 I wait only for You 
 Cause I want to know You more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more 
 I'm reaching for the highest goal 
 That I might receive the prize 
 Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside, out of my way 
 Cause I want to know You more 
 More and more 
 I want to know You 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I want to know You more 
 More and more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more

 I want to know You more 
 I want to touch You 
 I want to see Your face 
 I want to know You more

 I want to know You more 
 More and more 
 I want to touch You

 Spoken until the end: 
 Foundations can't be moved without destroying the building.  If the foundation of this building we're in right now were moved, what would happen to the building?  It would collapse.  Now, you can move the building and put it on another foundation, but that foundation, it's there.  Because foundations are secure. 
 Because this nation, we know what the foundation is.  It's all over the Constitution, it's all over the walls of the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial.   It's written throughout history.  Regardless of what the politicians believe, regardless of what you and I attest to, truth is truth.  The Founding Fathers built it on the truth of the Word of God.  Everything about the laws of this land were taken from the Scripture from Old Testament, they were right from, uh, the Old Testament books of Law.  And so you can't move away from that foundation without destroying the nation.  And so this whole debate and argument over what's truth and what's not truth.  The only truth that founded this nation -- we left a country of tyranny for religious freedom to worship. 
 And God's not afraid of who or how you worship, because He knows sooner or later, if you're truly seeking, you'll see Him.  God's not insecure; He's confident.  And so we need to come to Him, see Him as He is, and that's true worship.  Because in the midst of that all securities are made clear, and all fears are relieved.

What can I say 
 What can I do 
 What can I bring to offer You 
 There is no gold 
 No precious pearl 
 Nothing on earth 
 That compares to You 
 Lord here I stand 
 With empty hands 
 I will exalt the one who lifted me 
 Out of the miry clay to heights of eagle's wings 
 Words cannot express 
 All I know is this 
 You've changed me 
 You've changed me 
 I can remember how I used to be 
 I was so bound but now I'm free 
 I will exalt the one who lifted me 
 What can I say 
 A father like You 
 A love that is strong 
 Gentle and true 
 You draw me close 
 Just like a child 
 Safe in Your arms 
 There is no doubt 
 This is my place 
 This is my way 
 I will exalt the one who lifted me 
 Out of the miry clay to heights of eagle's wings 
 Words cannot express 
 All I know is this 
 You've changed me 
 You've changed me 
 I can remember how I used to be 
 I was so bound but now I'm free 
 I will exalt the one who lifted me 
 I will exalt the one who lifted me 
 Out of the miry clay to heights of eagle's wings 
 Words cannot express 
 All I know is this 
 You've changed me 
 You've changed me 
 I can remember how I used to be 
 I was so bound but now I'm free 
 I will exalt the one 
 I will exalt the one 
 I will exalt the one who lifted me

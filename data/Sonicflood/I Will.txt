My Saviour, Redeemer 
 My love and my Lord 
 I'll give You all of my heart 
 My will and my soul 
 You take me as I am 
 A scarred and broken man 
 Lord, I surrender all I have to You 
 To You 
 I will give you everything 
 I will, I will 
 Make my life an offering 
 I will, I will 
 My Saviour, I'll never 
 Forget what You've done 
 You carried the weight of my sin 
 To the cross, the victory's won! 
 You make my heart brand new 
 Now there's nothing I won't do 
 Lord, I surrender all I am to You, to You 
 So when I lose my life, 
 I save it, I save it 
 And by Your Grace I'm saved 
 I know, I know it 
 And when You were on the cross 
 You gave it, You gave it all 
 Oh, yes You did 
 You gave it all 
 I will give you everything 
 I will, I will 
 Make my life an offering 
 I will, I will 
 I will give my heart to You 
 I will, I will 
 Broken and poured out for You 
 I will, I will 
 No price I pay 
 Will ever be too great for me 
 To rest alone in the love You've shown 
 I'm free, I'm free 
 You took the stripes 
 You took the pain for me 
 So now I sing a song of hope 
 I'm free, I'm free 
 So now I sing Hallelujah 
 I'm free, I'm free

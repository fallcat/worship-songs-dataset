I've thought about it for a while 
 The many questions for the asking 
 She asked if God was just a slob (like us) 
 Maybe something there is lacking 
 My God's not in the sky 
 He's here with you and I 
 Just ask me if I die 
 My God's not in the sky 
 Let me tell you all my thoughts (on God) 
 'Cause I just met with Him this 
 Morning 
 He gives me peace so I can wear (a smile) 
 While others drown in melancholy bitter 
 Sadness all this madness 
 My God's not in the sky 
 He's here with you and I 
 Just ask me if I die 
 My God's not in the sky 
 I know you see the need to know (for sure) 
 You want to find Him - He will find you 
 My God's not in the sky 
 He's here with you and I 
 Just ask me if I die 
 My God's not in the sky

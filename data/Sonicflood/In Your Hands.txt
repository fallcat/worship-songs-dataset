Sometimes my prayers seem so empty 
 Your voice seems so far away 
 But in my pain I see You molding me 
 You are the potter, I'm the clay 
 In Your hands, for every storm there is a reason 
 In Your hands, there is a time for every season 
 Though my tears may fall, You hold me close 
 And love me through it all 
 In Your hands... 
 When the clouds form all around me 
 I know the rain will bring new life 
 With every trial just keep molding me 
 As your plan unfolds before my very eyes 
 In Your hands, for every storm there is a reason 
 In Your hands, there is a time for every season 
 Though my tears may fall, You hold me close 
 And love me through it all 
 In Your hands... 
 You turn my weeping into dancing 
 You give my feet a place to stand 
 You will not turn away the asking 
 Even when Your ways are hard to understand 
 In Your hands, for every storm there is a reason 
 In Your hands, there is a time for every season 
 Though my tears may fall, You hold me close 
 And love me through it all 
 In Your hands...

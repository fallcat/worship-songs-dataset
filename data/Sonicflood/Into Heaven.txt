Okay, now I'm on my way 
 Give up everything I have 
 To be with you someday 
 Oh yeah, everything's alright 
 Always looking upward as I got you in my 
 Sight 
 Hey mother look at me 
 I've made my connection 
 As I'm steppin' into heaven 
 Hey don't you pity me 
 I'll put on perfection 
 As I'm steppin' into heaven 
 Hey you, dig the way I feel 
 Is there any room to doubt that all of this is 
 Real 
 I know truth is on my side 
 There's no second guessing as I switch to 
 Power glide 
 Hey mother look at me 
 I've made my connection 
 As I'm steppin' into heaven 
 Hey don't you pity me 
 I'll put on perfection 
 As I'm steppin' into heaven 
 Would you like to trade, all your rags for 
 Gold, leave behind the pain 
 All the days you've spent left out in the 
 Cold will not be in vain 
 Hey mother look at me 
 I've made my connection 
 As I'm steppin' into heaven 
 Hey don't you pity me 
 I'll put on perfection 
 As I'm steppin' into heaven

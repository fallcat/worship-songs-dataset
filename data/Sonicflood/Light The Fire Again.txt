Don't let my love grow cold 
 I'm calling out, light the fire again 
 Don't let my vision die 
 I'm calling out, light the fire again 
 You know my heart my deeds 
 I'm calling out, light the fire again 
 I need your discipline 
 I'm calling out, light the fire again 
 I am here to buy gold refined in the fire 
 Naked and poor, wretched and blind I come 
 Clothe me in white, so I won't be ashamed 
 Lord, light the fire again

I stand to praise You 
 But I fall on my knees 
 My spirit is willing 
 But my flesh is so weak 
 Light the fire 
 (Light the fire) 
 In my soul 
 (In my weary soul) 
 Fan the flame 
 (Fan the flame) 
 Make me whole 
 (Make my spirit whole) 
 Lord, You know 
 (Lord, You know) 
 Just where I've been 
 (Where I've been) 
 So light the fire 
 In my heart again 
 I feel Your arms around me 
 As the power of 
 Your healing begins 
 Your spirit moves through me 
 Like a mighty rushing wind 
 Light the fire 
 (Light the fire) 
 In my soul 
 (In my weary soul) 
 Fan the flame 
 (Fan the flame) 
 Make me whole 
 (Make my spirit whole) 
 Lord, You know 
 (Lord, You know) 
 Just where I've been 
 (Where I've been) 
 So light the fire 
 In my heart again 
 Light the fire 
 (Light the fire) 
 In my soul 
 (In my weary soul) 
 Fan the flame 
 (Fan the flame) 
 Make me whole 
 (Make my spirit whole) 
 Lord, You know 
 (Lord, You know) 
 Just where I've been 
 (Where I've been) 
 So light the fire 
 In my heart again 
 Light the fire in my heart again 
 Light the fire in my heart again

You're the Lord of the dance 
 You're the dancing Lord 
 Everybody dance now 
 In the Holy Spirit 
 Everybody love the One, love the One 
 Love the One, the One you love the most now 
 Can't nobody stop me now 
 Gonna give it all I got 
 Gonna run to You, run to You 
 Run to You, just like a child 
 It's just this love I have inside 
 (Yeah, I want it) 
 I need Your presence in my heart 
 (Yeah, I need it) 
 I want You love more each day 
 (More and more, Lord) 
 And when I dance before You, Lord 
 I'm gonna dance with all my might

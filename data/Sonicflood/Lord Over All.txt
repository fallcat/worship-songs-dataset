Be the reason I live 
 Be my quest, my constant vision 
 Be the water I drink 
 The treasure I seek more than gold 
 Be the fire in my heart 
 My consuming love and passion 
 Be the air that I breathe 
 The song that I sing from my heart and soul 
 Jesus, Lord over all 
 Be the Lord over me 
 Jesus, drawn to this alter I come 
 Here is my heart 
 May Your will be done in me

You know me very well 
 More than I know myself 
 You know the frailness of my frame 
 And still You show Your love 
 In measures deep and wide 
 The kindness of a king who saves 
 Lead me onward towards the cross 
 I give myself to You 
 You're the love of my life 
 You're the arms open wide 
 I know Your presence is here in this place 
 Lord I surrender all that I am 
 To the love of my life 
 Knowing my heart would fail 
 You made a way for me 
 You died to set this captive free 
 In this You've shown Your love 
 Within my darkest hour 
 That's why my prayer will always be 
 Lead me onward towards the cross 
 I give myself to You 
 That I may know You more 
 You're the love of my life 
 You're the arms open wide 
 I know Your presence is here in this place 
 Lord I surrender all that I am 
 To the love of my life 
 You're the love of my life 
 You're the arms open wide 
 I know Your presence is here in this place 
 Lord I surrender all that I am 
 To the love of my life 
 To the love of my life 
 Love of my life 
 Love of my life 
 Love of my life

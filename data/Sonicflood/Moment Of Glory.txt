Woke up this morning to a holy invitation 
 My eyes were opened to a world of inspiration 
 I felt the wind blow on my face 
 I felt the sunlight of Your grace 
 Woke up this morning witha child-like fascination 
 Just like the stars shining at night 
 You are the sun that gives me light 
 Raising my hands up to the sky 
 I'm breathing in the breathe of life 
 In this moment of glory 
 There's something radical about this revelation 
 There's something magical about the cloud formations 
 I see Your glory in this place 
 I feel the mystery of Your grace 
 There's something wonderful about this transformation 
 Just like the stars shining at night 
 You are the sun that gives me light 
 Raising my hands up to the sky 
 I'm breathing in the breathe of life 
 In this moment of glory 
 I can see Your glory 
 I can see Your glory 
 In this moment of glory 
 Woke up this morning to a holy invitation 
 In this moment

Lord, I want to see You 
 Whisper in the stillness of the night 
 Lord I want to hear You 
 Morningstar, glorious light 
 Gentle spirit in the night 
 More than anything in my life 
 More than anything my soul desires 
 Holy fire in the dark 
 Of my heart of hearts 
 How I need You 
 How I love You 
 More than anything 
 How sweet, the rain that falls on barren land 
 So much more I need You 
 Divine the grace that heals a broken man 
 Precious Lord, I love You 
 Precious Lord 
 How I need You 
 Let me hear You 
 Let me know You more

Oh my soul 
 All my inmost being 
 Praise You Lord 
 Oh my soul 
 Praise Your holy name 
 I'll never forget that You 
 Forgive my sin 
 Redeem my life 
 From the pit 
 Forevermore 
 I'll never forget You Lord 
 Praise You Lord 
 With all my heart 
 I know You satisfy 
 Praise You Lord 
 Lord most high 
 For how You've changed my life 
 Your love surrounds me 
 I'll never forget that You 
 Forgive my sin 
 Redeemed my life 
 I will never forget that You 
 Made me whole 
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul 
 Forevermore 
 I'll never forget You Lord

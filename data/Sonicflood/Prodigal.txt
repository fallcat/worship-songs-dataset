Lord you see into my heart 
 There is no place I can hide 
 When I feel I've been apart 
 From You, from You 
 Broken I bow at your feet 
 Surrendering all that I am 
 Lord I know that I am complete 
 In You, only You 
 So here is my life 
 I give it all 
 I'm placing it in Your hands 
 Mold me and make me 
 Let me fall into Your arms of love again 
 Where I should have always been 
 My sin You remember no more 
 Your mercy has covered my scars 
 Your healing has welcomed me home 
 I am new in You

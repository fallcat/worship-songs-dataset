I feel like I've gone astray 
 Just like a runaway 
 From the grip of your love 
 It's not that I wanted to 
 It's not like I tried to do it that way 
 I've found there's no distance too far 
 That could change who You are 
 That could turn You away 
 Your love comes rushing in 
 Pouring over me 
 I know when I come running 
 You're there for me 
 There's no way that I 
 Could ever lose my way 
 I know I'm captive in Your arms 
 In the grip of Your grace 
 When doubts and fear are starting to move in 
 That's when your love 
 Your love comes rushing in 
 Every day Your mercy's new 
 And there's nothing I can do 
 To earn Your love 
 I believe in what You say 
 Trust in You and know Your grace 
 Is more than enough 
 There's no mountain so high 
 No river so wide 
 That could keep me from You 
 Your love comes rushing in 
 Pouring over me 
 I know when I come running 
 You're there for me 
 There's no way that I 
 Could ever lose my way 
 I know I'm captive in Your arms 
 In the grip of Your grace 
 When doubts and fears are starting to move in 
 That's when Your love 
 Your love comes rushing in 
 Your love comes rushing in 
 Pouring over me 
 I know when I come running 
 You're there for me 
 There's no way that I 
 Could ever lose my way 
 I know I'm captive in Your arms 
 In the grip of Your grace 
 When doubts and fears are starting to move in 
 That's when Your love 
 Your love comes rushing in 
 Your love comes rushing in

Wa ooh wa ooh 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 Wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh 
 You will never change 
 You stay the same 
 You are my hope of glory 
 I will never have to be afraid 
 Through the course of time 
 And all my life 
 You've been my place of shelter 
 Here beneath your love I will remain 
 I will sing that, 
 You are my refuge 
 In you alone I place my trust 
 Here in the shadow of your wings 
 You are my refuge 
 The maker of the stars above 
 Still you make your home inside of me 
 You shelter me 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 You shelter me 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 Wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh 
 You are lord of all 
 My mind recalls 
 The times that you've been faithful 
 Now I know your love is here to stay 
 Through the course of time 
 And all my life 
 You've been my place of shelter 
 Here beneath your love I will remain 
 I will sing that, 
 You are my refuge 
 In you alone I place my trust 
 Here in the shadow of your wings 
 You are my refuge 
 The maker of the stars above 
 Still you make your home inside of me 
 You shelter me 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 Wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh 
 I will sing that, 
 You are my refuge 
 In you alone I place my trust 
 Here in the shadow of your wings 
 You are my refuge 
 The maker of the stars above 
 Still you make your home inside of me 
 You are my refuge 
 In you alone I place my trust 
 Here in the shadow of your wings 
 You shelter me 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 You shelter me 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 You shelter me 
 Wa ooh wa ooh 
 You shelter me

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 There's just something about that name 
 Master, Savior, Jesus 
 Like the fragrance after the rain 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 There's just something about that name 
 Master, Savior, Jesus 
 Like the fragrance after the rain 
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus 
 Let all heaven and earth proclaim 
 Kings and kingdoms will all pass away 
 But there's just something about that name

Stir in me, a fire that the world can not explain 
 I come to worship you. 
 Stir in me, a passion that my heart can not contain 
 I come to worship you. 
 Hold me, break me, mold me and make me more and more like you, 
 I come to worship you. 
 To love you, fear you draw ever near you as I worship you, 
 I come to worship you, oh Lord

I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 I'm laying them down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 I'm trading my sickness 
 I'm trading my pain 
 I'm laying them down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 We say, yes Lord, yes Lord 
 Yes, yes, Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord 
 Yes, yes, Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord 
 Yes, yes, Lord Amen 
 I am pressed but not crushed 
 Persecuted not abandoned 
 Struck down but not destroyed 
 I am blessed beyond the curse 
 For his promise will endure 
 That his joy's gonna be my strength 
 Though the sorrow may last for the night 
 His joy comes with the morning 
 I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 I'm laying them down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 I'm trading my sickness 
 I'm trading my pain 
 I'm laying them down 
 For the joy of the Lord 
 We say, yes Lord, yes Lord 
 Yes, yes, Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord 
 Yes, yes, Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord 
 Yes, yes, Lord Amen 
 I am pressed but not crushed 
 Persecuted not abandoned 
 Struck down but not destroyed 
 I am blessed beyond the curse 
 For his promise will endure 
 That his joy's gonna be my strength 
 Though the sorrow may last for the night 
 His joy comes with the morning

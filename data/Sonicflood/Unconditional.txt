Lord you found me 
 Lost in a desolate place 
 Now I feel your love around me 
 I'll follow you all of my days 
 I surrender 
 My spirit and mind Lord, to you 
 My heart is sold to your kingdom 
 Forever I want to be true, Lord to you 
 Your peace, it floods my soul. 
 It's supernatural! 
 And your amazing love is unconditional 
 Your joy, it overflows 
 It's supernatural! 
 And your love for me is unconditional 
 Sweet assurance 
 Your grace will always endure 
 Whatever becomes of this vessel 
 Your will, will be done on earth 
 Lord I trust you 
 To move in miraculous ways! 
 Now I feel your arms around me 
 And I'll worship you all of my days 
 And give you praise 
 Your peace, it floods my soul. 
 It's supernatural! 
 Your amazing love is unconditional 
 Your joy, it overflows 
 It's supernatural! 
 And your love for me is unconditional 
 I feel your arms around me 
 I feel your peace inside me 
 Amazing love 
 I surrender 
 Peace it floods my soul 
 It's supernatural! 
 Your amazing love is unconditional 
 Your joy, it overflows 
 It's supernatural! 
 And your love for me is unconditional 
 Unconditional

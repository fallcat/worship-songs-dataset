I will dance, I will sing 
 To be mad for my king 
 Nothing Lord is hindering 
 This passion in my soul 
 I will dance, I will sing 
 To be mad for my king 
 Nothing Lord is hindering 
 This passion in my soul 
 And I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 And I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 And I'll become even more undignified than this 
 Some may say it's foolishness 
 La La La, Hey 
 La La La, Hey 
 La La La, Hey

Find it hard to keep it in today 
 Though some might say that I'm crazy 
 Lunatic, look out he's coming our way 
 All around people stare but I don't care, no I 
 Don't care 
 If you knew just what I've got you'd like it 
 A lot 
 See what I got 
 Compromise seems like the newest craze 
 When apathy leads to condoning 
 Maybe we're just going through a phase 
 All around the issues change so am I deranged 
 To feel the need to pray

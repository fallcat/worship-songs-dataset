When the music fades 
 And all is stripped away 
 And I simply come 
 Longing just to bring 
 Something that's of worth 
 That will bless Your heart 
 I'll bring you more than a song For a song in itself 
 Is not what you have required 
 You search much deeper within 
 Through the ways things appear 
 You're looking into my heart 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You 
 All about You, Jesus 
 I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it 
 When it's all about You 
 It's all about You King of endless worth 
 No one could express 
 How much You deserve 
 Though I'm weak and poor 
 All I have is Yours 
 Every single breath 
 I'll bring you more than a song 
 For a song in itself 
 Is not what you have required 
 You search much deeper within 
 Through the ways things appear 
 You're looking into my heart 
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
 And it's all about You

God above 
 In You I live and breathe 
 And You will always be 
 Son of God 
 I owe my life to You 
 Your promises are true 
 Your love goes on and on forever 
 So write Your name upon my heart 
 Burn Your word into my mind 
 Make a temple of this body 
 Let Your Spirit move inside 
 I have wandered through the valley 
 And I have wondered who I am 
 So live in me, make Your mark 
 And write Your name upon my heart 
 God above 
 The first, the last, the same 
 All glory to Your name 
 My Jesus 
 It's You who I adore 
 Lamb of God and Savior 
 Your love goes on and on forever 
 Imprint on every part of me 
 The image of the Son 
 And complete in me the work 
 You have begun

I will live to declare Your glory 
 And my heart is filled with praise 
 I will shout and I will sing 
 For all of my days 
 Wanna walk in Your holiness 
 Wanna stand for all Your ways 
 When You call I will say yes 
 For all of my days 
 Wanna die so You can live 
 Resurrect my heart again 
 I will tell the world 
 That You are the Holy One 
 You are the Holy One 
 And I worship Your name 
 You are the Holy One 
 And I stand amazed 
 You are the Holy One

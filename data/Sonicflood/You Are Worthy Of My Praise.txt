I will give you all my worship 
 I will give you all my praise 
 You alone I long to worship 
 You alone are worthy of my praise 
 I will worship (echo) 
 With all of my heart (echo) 
 I will praise you (echo) 
 With all of my strength (all my strength) 
 I will bow down (echo) 
 And hail You as king (echo) 
 I will love You (echo) 
 Give You everything (everything) 
 Repeat with trust instead of love 
 Sing to You a new song from our hearts 
 Straight to You 
 From our Hearts to Yours 
 We worship Jesus 
 We love You Father 
 We worship Jesus 
 We love You Father 
 Repeat 
 I wanna give I wanna give You all the praise 
 I wanna give I wanna give You all the praise 
 I wanna give I wanna give You all the praise 
 I wanna give I wanna give You all the praise 
 I wanna give I wanna give You all the praise

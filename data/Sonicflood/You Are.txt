Broken I run to You 
 You are my healer 
 Humbly I bow to You 
 You are my Lord 
 And I will give You glory 
 For everything You are 
 You are the great I Am 
 You are the Prince of Life 
 You are the Spotless Lamb 
 My Risen King 
 The reason why I sing 
 I want to live for You 
 You are worthy 
 Boldly I'll speak Your truth 
 And lay down my life 
 And I will give You glory 
 For everything You are 
 You are the Righteousness 
 You are the Living Word 
 You are so Glorious 
 My Lord and King 
 The reason why I sing 
 You are the Light, the Hope of Glory 
 You are the Way, the Truth and Life 
 You are the Never Ending Story 
 The Gift of God, you are the Christ 
 You are my God my Lord 
 And Saviour 
 You are the First you are the Last 
 I want to be with You forever 
 I want to be with You my Lord 
 You are the Light, the Hope of Glory 
 You are the Way, the Truth and Life 
 You are the Never Ending Story 
 The Gift of God, you are the Christ

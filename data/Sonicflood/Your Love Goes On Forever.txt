Praise Him all you shining stars 
 Praise the Lord in all the earth 
 Every creature near and far 
 Praise the Lord 
 Stormy winds and clouds 
 Of white 
 Valleys clothed in splendor 
 Burning sun and moonlit night 
 Praise the Lord 
 Heaven and all the universe 
 Proclaim Your power and 
 Your worth 
 Hallelujah 
 Your love goes on forever 
 God of life and Lord of love 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 Hallelujah 
 Your love goes on forever 
 All you creatures of the sea 
 And children of the Savior 
 Yearning hearts and oceans deep 
 Praise the Lord 
 For the mercy in His hands 
 For the healing in His scars 
 For the grace in His commands 
 Praise the Lord 
 Heaven and all the universe 
 Proclaim Your power and 
 Your worth 
 Hallelujah 
 Your love goes on forever 
 God of life and Lord of love 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 Hallelujah 
 Your love goes on forever 
 For all You've done 
 And Your infinite love 
 We lift our hearts to worship 
 For Your sweet grace 
 We lift Your Name 
 Let Your praise go on and 
 On forever more 
 For the mercy in His hands 
 For the healing in His scars 
 For the grace in His commands 
 Praise the Lord 
 Heaven and all the universe 
 Proclaim Your power and 
 Your worth 
 Hallelujah 
 Your love goes on forever 
 God of life and Lord of love 
 Who was and is and is to come 
 Hallelujah 
 Your love goes on forever

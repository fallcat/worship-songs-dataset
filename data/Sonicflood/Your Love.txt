Your love, give me Your love 
 To fill up my heart 
 Your peace, give me Your peace 
 To comfort my soul 
 Your joy, give me Your joy 
 To shine through the dark 
 Change me, oh Lord 
 For my life is Yours 
 When I think of all You've done 
 Kept every promise 
 And kept me alive in Your Son 
 In the light of all this 
 I'll give my life I'll take up my cross 
 Cause everything else I count but loss 
 There's nothing apart from You 
 That fills my longings 
 You satisfy me with truth 
 And I'm never wanting 
 I'll give my life I'll take up my cross 
 Cause everything else I count but loss

Lover of my soul 
 I want to tell You 
 Only You have all of me 
 I cannot contain 
 My adoration 
 I'm in love so desperately 
 No one is as lovely as You are 
 And there is no one else 
 Who has my heart 
 Jesus, You have me completely 
 Every breath that I breathe 
 I am absolutely in love 
 Jesus, I am Yours forever 
 All of me surrenders 
 I am absolutely in love with You 
 Down upon my knees 
 I'm lost in worship 
 Humbled by Your majesty 
 What is there to say 
 But how I love You 
 Thank You for forgiving me 
 No one is as lovely as You are 
 And there is no one else 
 Who has my heart 
 Jesus, You have me completely 
 Every breath that I breathe 
 I am absolutely in love 
 Jesus, I am Yours forever 
 All of me surrenders 
 I am absolutely in love with You 
 All I am is Yours 
 Only Yours 
 Jesus, You have me completely 
 Every breath that I breathe 
 I am absolutely in love 
 Jesus, You have me completely 
 Every breath that I breathe 
 I am absolutely in love 
 Jesus, I am Yours forever 
 All of me surrenders 
 I am absolutely in love with You 
 In love with You

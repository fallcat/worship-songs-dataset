Alive in this Moment 
 It's been so long since I have met You here 
 Since I have said these words and cried these tears 
 And like a child would come I run into our secret place 
 And as the music fades the tears are rolling down my face 
 I am alive in this moment 
 In this moment I am found 
 I am alive in this moment 
 In this moment I belong 
 It's been so long since I have met You here 
 Since I have heard You speak and let You near 
 And like a wayward son I've come with nothing left to hide 
 Here in this moment I have come to offer up my life 
 Here only one fire burns 
 Here only one melody is heard 
 Once again for the very first time 
 My eyes are opening

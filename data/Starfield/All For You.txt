Nothing compares to, life I have in You. 
 Nothing of this world satisfies, 
 So, I want to let go, I want to let You know 
 All that I have to give is Yours 
 Here I am, as gold to the fire 
 I will surrender to Your hand 
 To this place, 
 Lord, I have come ready for Your touch 
 It's all for You, 
 It's all for You, 
 I'm letting go, 
 I'm letting go. 
 What is it in me, that hangs on for so long? 
 Why do I fight the tears that come? 
 I work so hard to, keep in control when, 
 Al that I want is to let go 
 I'll take this life, 
 And lay it down, 
 I'm letting go, 
 My hopes and dreams, 
 Here at Your feet, 
 I'm letting go, 
 I'm letting go. 
 And I am ready for Your life, 
 And I'm ready for You now.

I don't want fake, I'm tired of counterfeit 
 All this plastic love, man I want none of it 
 I don't want fake, I just can't take it anymore 
 I won't be satisfied, until you are by my side 
 All I want is you, all I want is you 
 I just can't live for another 
 All I want is you 
 I won't be romanced, by any other love 
 'Cause what I've got will always be enough 
 I won't be romanced, I won't take the chance on any other love 
 I won't be satisfied, until you are by my side

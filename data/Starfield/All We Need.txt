Come sing, sing your heart 
 Come sing before the One who's worthy 
 The One who is worthy 
 Lift your hands, lift your hands up high 
 Let the love of Jesus come and heal you 
 Let Jesus heal you 
 For we were made for more 
 Yeah, we were made for more 
 We are made for more 
 We are Yours, we are Yours 
 You are all our hears are beating for 
 And You will always be 
 We don't want what the world gives anymore 
 You are all we need 
 Come, let your soul be free 
 Come lay your burdens down before Him 
 Come love and adore Him 
 Breathe deep the breath of God 
 Fill your mouth with His praises now and worship 
 Everyone worship 
 You are all our hears are beating for 
 And You will always be 
 There's nothing of Earth we treasure more 
 For You are all we need

 Come on sing your song, come on and sing it out 
 Come on sing your song, come on and sing it out 
 Come on sing your song, come on and sing it out 
 Come on sing your song, you've got to sing it out

Beyond this Door 
 Don't you see 
 That more than you could know or hope for 
 Lies beyond this door 
 Like a treasure buried deep it waits 
 To be discovered, waits to be released 
 Open up your heart 
 For just a moment let true freedom take its hold 
 And I promise you that what you'll find 
 Is more than what you've ever preconceived 
 This life's not long 
 Like a breath it comes and goes 
 So un-guard your heart 
 Let these walls around you fall 
 If you could see beyond the here and now 
 I know that everything would change 
 But you're hard and scarred by what the past 
 Has made you into 
 Shaped what you believe 
 I know you've been failed 
 And I know that you've tried 
 It's always the same 
 Time and time again 
 But you have to know 
 That nobody else 
 Can stand in your place 
 And face the crowds

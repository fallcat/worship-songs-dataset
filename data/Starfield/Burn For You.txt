Can my prayers be heard over all the noise? 
 Can my life still count, can I have a voice? 
 Could you use this faith in your master plan 
 Use these simple words, use these willing hands? 
 If you can, then here I am 
 I'll burn, burn like a fire 
 I'll burn, with love and desire 
 I'll burn, I'll burn for you 
 I'll burn for you 
 Can you lead me, Lord, in the every day 
 Teach me discipline, teach me to obey? 
 Can you show me where I can be your light 
 As I walk with you, through the trials of life? 
 If you can, then here I am 
 I'll burn, burn like a fire 
 I'll burn, with love and desire 
 I'll burn, I'll burn for you 
 I'll burn, burn like a fire 
 I'll burn, to life you higher 
 I'll burn, burn for you 
 I wanna feel the fire 
 I wanna feel the flames 
 I wanna burn forever 
 I wanna burn for your name

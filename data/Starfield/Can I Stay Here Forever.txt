Through forgotten convictions 
 Misplaced affections 
 I'm losing the sound of Your voice 
 I've been chasing after emptiness 
 Trying to tidy up this mess 
 And I swear I've been down this road before 
 I wanna get back to where it all began 
 When I would long for only You 
 Like a child I'll take You at Your word 
 As these mountains of doubt, they fade away 
 I'm longing to trust and love You more 
 So for me this is beautiful 
 Brand new thought and a brand new world 
 Can I stay here forever, here with You? 
 I've lost sight of what first drew me 
 To the love that pursued me 
 The joy that inspired my song 
 The friendship that was all I knew 
 The arms that I would fall into 
 Seem miles and years from where I am today 
 I've got to get back to where it all began 
 When I would long for only you 
 Like a child I'll take You at Your word 
 As these mountains of doubt, they fade away 
 I'm longing to trust and love You more 
 So for me this is beautiful 
 Brand new thought and a brand new world 
 Can I stay here forever, here with You? 
 Can I stay here forever, here with you? 
 Surrounded by your mercy, clothed in your truth 
 Always I'll stay, always here with You 
 Can I be here forever, here with you 
 Can I know what it's like to deeply love You 
 Always, Lord, let me stay 
 Always here with You 
 Like a child I'll take You at Your word 
 As these mountains of doubt, they fade away 
 I'm longing to trust and love You more 
 So for me this is beautiful 
 Brand new thought and a brand new world 
 Can I stay here forever, here with You?

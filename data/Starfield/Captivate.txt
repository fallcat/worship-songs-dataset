You say, strength is found in weakness 
 Peace in incompleteness 
 So why do I hold on? 
 You look, For a heart that's open 
 For beauty in the broken 
 So why am I withdrawn? 
 My soul's screaming out 
 To be found in You 
 Spirit draw me to my knees 
 Captivate all of me, all of me 
 Here before You honestly 
 Captivate all of me, all of me 
 I'm so messy and distracted 
 Undisciplined and tactless 
 Here on the inside 
 I thought age would tell the secrets 
 But the secrets are still secret 
 And the years are passing by 
 ... 
 Teach me to wait in the moments of my need 
 Teach me to hear the melodies of peace

Could I talk to You? Are You listening? 
 Would You let me ask the questions 
 That burn inside of me? 
 I am reaching out, I am holding on 
 Feel like one of Your affections 
 But not quite like I belong 
 Like I belong 
 I am numb today, everything's a blur 
 I've seen too much to deny 
 Too little to be sure 
 Like a prodigal, like a distant son 
 I can see You from a distance 
 But I'm too ashamed to come 
 Will You see me through this valley? 
 Will You hold my outstretched hands? 
 As the world caves in around me 
 Will You help me understand? 
 Help me understand, help me understand 
 I am scared to fall, scared to carry on 
 Am I losing to the cynic after running for so long? 
 There's a child in me, lost in mystery 
 But it's buried underneath the earth longing to be free 
 Will You see me through this valley? 
 Will You hold my outstretched hands? 
 As the world caves in around me 
 Will You help me understand? 
 Will You see me through this valley? 
 Will You hold my outstretched hands? 
 As the world caves in around me 
 Will You help me understand? 
 Will You see me through this valley? 
 Will You hold my outstretched hands? 
 As the world caves in around me 
 Will You help me understand? 
 Help me understand, help me understand 
 Help me understand, let me hold you [Incomprehensible] 
 Help me understand, yeah 
 Help me understand, yeah yeah 
 Help me understand, yeah

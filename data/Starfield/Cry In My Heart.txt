Cry in my Heart 
 There's a cry in my heart 
 For Your glory to fall 
 For Your presence to fill up my senses 
 There's a yearning again 
 A thirst for discipline 
 A hunger for things that are deeper 
 Could You take me beyond? 
 Could You carry me through? 
 If I open my heart? 
 Could I go there with You? 
 (For I've been here before) 
 (Yet I know there's still more) 
 (Oh Lord I need to know You) 
 For what do I have 
 If I don't have you Jesus? 
 What in this life 
 Could mean anymore? 
 You are my rock 
 You are my glory 
 You are the lifter 
 Of my head

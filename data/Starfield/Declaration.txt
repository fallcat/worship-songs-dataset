This is my heart's condition 
 This world has ammunition 
 To tear me down 
 And steal my life away 
 I know there's more than this 
 More than temptation's kiss 
 So lift me up 
 And give me strength to say 
 I will live 
 I will live for You 
 I will live 
 I will live for You 
 I've had the revelation 
 This is my declaration 
 More of You 
 Oh God, and less of me 
 'Cause You are my new existence 
 I offer no resistance 
 I'm running to 
 The One I know I need 
 I will live 
 I will live for You 
 I will live 
 I will live for You 
 How could I walk away? 
 How could I walk away? 
 How could I walk away? 
 I will live 
 I will live for You 
 I will live 
 I will live for You 
 (I'll never walk away from You) 
 I will live for You 
 (I'll never walk away from You) 
 (I'll never walk away from You) 
 (I'll never walk away from You) 
 I will live for You 
 (I'll never walk away from You) 
 (I'll never walk away from You) 
 (I'll never walk away from You) 
 I will live for You 
 (I'll never walk away from You)

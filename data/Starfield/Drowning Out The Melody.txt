Drowning out the melody 
 Tim Neufeld, Dave Miller, Jon Neufeld 
 This world's so captivating 
 There's so much more to put faith in 
 Everybody's offering me my 15 minutes of fame 
 It wraps it's arms around me 
 It's whispering songs of freedom in my ear 
 It's tellin' me that I can be a superstar 
 It's telling me exactly what I want to hear 
 But Your harmony is drowning out the melody 
 It's raging inside my head 
 I tried to hide 
 But it was spinning round me pulling me inside 
 I opened my eyes 
 Just in time to see my worlds collide 
 Your love is changing my mind 
 The world around me starts to fade away 
 And I'm being refined 
 You're bringing dawn to a brand new day 
 This world's so captivating 
 So much to put my faith in 
 So many melodies 
 Competing for the right to be my song 
 It's an unrelenting ambush 
 Gunna find true love with just one more push 
 Gunna find my solace just over this next hill 
 Gunna reach Nirvana, gunna get my fill 
 You're making black and white the gray 
 You've replaced tears with Joy, and Night for day

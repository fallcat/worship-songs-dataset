Worn out, wasted 
 Like a bird with broken wings 
 Sometimes grace reminds me 
 I don't get to be the king 
 But love, it washes over 
 Love, it pulls me closer 
 Love, it changes everything 
 So everything is beautiful 
 Even when the tears are falling 
 I don't need a miracle to believe 
 Even in the crashing down 
 I can hear redemption calling 
 And everything is beautiful to me 
 Sweetly, You release me 
 From the weight of what I've done 
 The trigger trips the hammer 
 But the bullets never come 
 And love, it washes over 
 Love is flowing closer 
 Love, it changes everything 
 So everything is beautiful 
 Even when the tears are falling 
 I don't need a miracle to believe 
 Even in the crashing down 
 I can hear redemption calling 
 And everything is beautiful to me 
 Love, like a landslide, like the wind 
 Spins around and me pulls me in 
 At it's unveiling I begin 
 Everything is beautiful 
 Even when the tears are falling 
 I don't need a miracle to believe 
 Even in the crashing down 
 I can hear redemption calling 
 And everything is beautiful 
 Even when the tears are falling 
 I don't need a miracle to believe 
 Even in the crashing down 
 I can hear redemption calling 
 And everything is beautiful to me

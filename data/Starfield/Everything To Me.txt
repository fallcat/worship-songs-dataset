More than feelings and emotions 
 More than just a passing flame 
 I am tired of pretending 
 So tired of the games 
 More than going through the motions 
 More than all this compromise 
 More than proof of Your existence 
 More than trusting what I see 
 All I need to know for this life 
 Is that You're alive in me 
 More than answers to my questions 
 More than doubting needs resolve 
 I want You to be 
 Everything to me 
 Inside my thoughts 
 And through my life 
 I want to know Your peace 
 I want You to be 
 Everything to me 
 No rival throne 
 No equal love 
 No other to compete 
 More than living life in comfort 
 More than what You do for me 
 Would You teach me Lord to listen? 
 Would You draw me to my knees? 
 More than anything I lived for 
 More than all my hopes and dreams 
 Be all my hope 
 Be all my desire 
 May I be refined 
 Refined in Your fire 
 Lord all I want 
 And all that I need 
 Is for You to be everything to me

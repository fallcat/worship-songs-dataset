Falling to My Knees 
 Through the fire and through the fight 
 Through the peril of the night 
 I will trust You for the promise 
 Spoken over me 
 There is nothing left to hide 
 This is my surrendered life 
 I left behind all else 
 To follow only You 
 I'm falling to my knees 
 I'm falling to my knees 
 My faith's becoming sight 
 For Your mercies are made new 
 Here Your joy is shimmering through 
 And I'm living for the promise 
 That my hope is found in You 
 You're my strength my only prayer 
 And all the world could not compare 
 With the wonders of Your great and mighty love 
 I am here to find Your peace 
 I've been looking for relief 
 I have come because 
 There's nothing left to satisfies 
 I'm so taken by Your touch 
 I could never have to much 
 And I won't stop till You 
 Take me there to where you are

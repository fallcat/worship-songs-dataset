Filled With Your Glory 
 In my heart, in my heart, there's a fire burning 
 A passion deep within my soul 
 Not slowing down, not growing cold 
 An unquenchable flame 
 That keeps burning brighter 
 A love that's blazing like the sun 
 For who You are and what You've done 
 And as the fire is raging on 
 So your praise becomes my song 
 The whole earth 
 Is filled with Your glory Lord 
 Angels and men adore 
 Creation longs for what's in store 
 May You be honoured and glorified 
 Exalted and lifted high 
 Here at Your feet I lay my life 
 From the ends of the earth 
 To the heights of Heaven 
 Your glory Lord is far and wide 
 Through history You reign on high 
 From the depths of the sea 
 To the mountain's summit 
 Your power Lord it knows no bounds 
 A higher love cannot be found 
 So let the universe proclaim 
 Your great power and Your great name 
 The whole earth is filled with Your glory Lord 
 Angels and men adore 
 Creation longs for what's in store 
 May You be honoured and glorified 
 Exalted and lifted high 
 Here at Your feet I lay my life 
 The whole earth is filled with Your glory Lord 
 Mountains bow and oceans roar 
 Creation longs for what's in store 
 May You be honoured and glorified 
 Exalted and lifted high 
 Here at Your feet I lay my life

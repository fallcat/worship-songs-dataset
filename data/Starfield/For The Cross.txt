For the Cross 
 (Matt and Beth Redman) 
 I will love You for the Cross 
 And I will love You for the cost 
 Man of sufferings, Bringer of my peace. 
 You came into a world of shame 
 And paid a price we could not pay 
 Death that brought me life, 
 Blood that brought me home. 
 Death that brought me life, 
 Blood that brought me home. 
 And I love You for the cross, 
 I'm overwhelmed by the mystery, 
 I love You for the cross, 
 That Jesus you would do this for me. 
 When You were broken, You were beaten, 
 You were punished, I go free, 
 When You were wounded and rejected, 
 In Your mercy, I am healed. 
 Jesus Christ the sinner's friend 
 Does this kindness know no bounds? 
 With Your precious blood You have purchased me 
 O, the mystery of the cross 
 You were punished, You were crushed 
 But that punishment has become my peace 
 Yes, that punishment has become my peace.

From now on 
 From now on everything has changed 
 And we will never be the same 
 The shame of our youth has been 
 Swallowed up in waves of grace 
 From now on everything has changed 
 From now on our whole 
 World has been re-arranged 
 As God reached down 
 To become man and clean the slate 
 Though we have come undone 
 Been blinded by the light of the sun 
 We are running into the arms of grace 
 We are finally seeing You face to face 
 And were singing songs of deliverance 
 For the return of our innocence 
 No longer are we walking the fence 
 Because the plot is finally making sense 
 The story has been told 
 For the world of deliverance 
 Under the law we lived by 
 Was the dream we kept 
 And looked so long for 
 A promise that You would 
 Do away with what for so long 
 Had come between us, 
 It will never be that way again

From every nation 
 God is calling out His own 
 A saved generation 
 That will not be overthrown 
 And we're not backing down, no way 
 We're finally seeing it clearly 
 One body, one church, one savior, 
 One call to praise 
 Hey! From the corners of the earth 
 We will sing of your great worth 
 And around the world proclaim 
 Our God Reigns! 
 We sing for freedom 
 For the reign of God to come 
 For His power through us 
 As the wars we wage are won 
 And we're not backing down, no way 
 We're finally seeing it clearly 
 One body, one church one savior, 
 One call to praise 
 (Repeat Chorus twice) 
 From the north to the south to the east to the west, we sing 
 To the one, to the one, to the one who is our King 
 (Repeat 2x) 
 (Repeat chorus twice) 
 From the corners of the Earth (corners of the Earth) 
 We sing (we sing) 
 From the corners of the Earth (corners of the Earth)

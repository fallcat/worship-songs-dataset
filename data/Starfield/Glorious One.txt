You are beauty 
 Oh, how beautiful You are 
 Shining like a treasure 
 You are brilliant 
 And You overwhelm the stars 
 Glory without mesure 
 Glorious One, Glorious One 
 Merciful Father 
 Beautiful Son 
 Glorious One, Glorious One 
 You are my pleasure, You are my song 
 Oh Glorious One 
 You are mercy, and Your mercy is Your crown 
 Infinite and ageless 
 You are forever, and forever You will be 
 Worthy of all praises 
 God Your fame is great 
 It cannot be contained 
 Your name is praised 
 Above all other names

You're the wonder and the mystery 
 You're the melody that must be sung 
 We rejoice with all those who believe 
 You're the song that was and is to come 
 Glory is rising 
 Yeah, glory is rising 
 Beautiful 
 Beautiful, the sound 
 Of redemption's song 
 Moving through the crowd 
 Singing, great is our God 
 Your children crying out 
 Beautiful 
 Beautiful, the sound 
 From the Earth, our voices will ascend 
 As an offering to You alone 
 May our praises echo without end 
 Join the angel choir around the throne 
 Glory is rising 
 Yeah, glory is rising 
 Beautiful 
 Beautiful, the sound 
 Of redemption's song 
 Moving through the crowd 
 Singing, great is our God 
 Your children crying out 
 Beautiful 
 Beautiful, the sound 
 Beautiful 
 Beautiful, the sound 
 Of redemption's song 
 Moving through the crowd 
 Singing, great is our God 
 Your children crying out 
 Beautiful 
 Beautiful, the sound 
 Beautiful, the sound

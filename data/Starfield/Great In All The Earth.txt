The world is Yours, and everything in it 
 It's all in Your command 
 There is no end, to Your domain 
 The planets shake, the galaxies tremble 
 They turn within Your hands 
 There is no end, to Your domain 
 No height or depth, You don't sustain 
 Great in all the Earth is Your glory oh God 
 The universe declares how amazing You are 
 Over history, and eternity, You alone are Lord and King 
 The world is Yours, and everything in it 
 It's all in Your command 
 There is no end, to Your domain 
 No height or depth, You don't sustain 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 There is none like You 
 Jesus there is none like You 
 You alone (You alone) 
 You alone (You alone) 
 You alone (You alone)

If all I've done 
 At last should come to nothing 
 And all I love, like sand be washed away 
 Still I will sing 
 Of Your unfailing glory 
 On bended knee 
 I'll lift my voice and say 
 Great is the Lord 
 Great is Your name 
 Till my last breath 
 I will proclaim 
 Great is the Lord 
 Great is Your name 
 I give my life 
 To sing Your praise 
 If You should speak 
 Or should remain in silence 
 Should give me light, or lead me through the dark 
 Whatever the cost 
 Whatever joy or sorrow 
 I'll worship still 
 Because of who You are 
 When death becomes 
 The end of all my labors 
 And Christ alone my rest and reward 
 May all I've done 
 Be one enduring echo 
 Resounding on to shout 
 Great is the Lord

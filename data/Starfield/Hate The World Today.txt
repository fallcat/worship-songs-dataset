Hate the World Today 
 As much as it thrills me 
 I wanna get off this ride 
 For gravity holds me 
 Yet grace calls me to Your side 
 As much as I trust You 
 Though I know that hope will come with time 
 Injustice prevails 
 And truth lags behind 
 Looking for beauty 
 Searching for sense in all the pain 
 A note of redemption 
 A break in the clouds to stop the rain 
 Can You hear me calling? 
 Have You been listening to my cry? 
 'Cause I can't carry on 
 If I don't find out why 
 I hate the world today 
 But I love this life you have given 
 I hate the world today 
 But I love you and I need you here 
 Though stuck in this moment 
 Everything good still comes from you 
 As much as I don't know 
 I'm trusting that you will carry me through 
 Though thousands are falling 
 Though comfort and peace are beyond reach 
 I'll offer my heart 
 I'll try to believe 
 It's pulling me to pieces 
 In a fight for my soul 
 These two worlds are waging war 
 The falling of humanity 
 And the truth that although 
 I can't see with my eyes 
 I'm still trying to believe

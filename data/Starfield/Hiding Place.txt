In the shadows, I can hear Your voice, 
 Singing to me 
 In the valley, I can hear Your heart, 
 Reaching for me now 
 And I wait flooded with your strength of Your peace 
 You're my defender, the shield of my heart 
 You are my hiding place 
 When terror surrounds me, You keep me from harm 
 You are my hiding place 
 In the darkness, I can feel Your light, 
 Wrap around me 
 In my suffering, I can feel Your joy, 
 Rising in me now 
 And I wait, flooded with the strength of Your peace 
 Here before You, Jesus 
 In this place, 
 Here before You now, 
 Face to face, 
 Under the shelter of the Most High 
 Will I be saved, and will I abide

Lift your hands, oh saints of God, lift up your hands 
 Sing for joy unto the risen Son of man 
 Celebrate the life that's been reborn in you 
 Celebrate the One who's making all things new 
 Hallelujah Christ is King 
 Hallelujah, rise and sing 
 Holy is our God 
 Wonderful is He 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Fall before your maker, every creature fall 
 Let your heart be still and know that He is God 
 Tremble at the feet of him upon the throne 
 Tremble men and angels before Him alone 
 Hallelujah, Christ is King 
 Hallelujah, rise and sing 
 Holy is our God 
 Wonderful is He 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Holy is our God 
 The prince of perfect peace 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 To the One who reigns forever 
 To the ancient of all days 
 Be the glory, power, majesty, and praise [3x] 
 Holy is our God 
 Wonderful is He 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 Holy is our God 
 The prince of perfect peace 
 Holy is the Lord Almighty 
 And the mountains bow and the rivers cry 
 Holy is our God 
 Over all the earth you reign

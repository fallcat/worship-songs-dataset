I see the king of glory 
 Coming on the clouds with fire 
 The whole earth shakes 
 The whole earth shakes 
 Yeah 
 I see his love and mercy 
 Washing over all our sin 
 The people sing 
 The people sing 
 Hosanna 
 Hosanna 
 Hosanna in the highest x2 
 I see a generation 
 Rising up to take their place 
 With selfless faith 
 With selfless faith 
 I see a near revival 
 Stirring as we pray and seek 
 We're on our knees 
 We're on our knees 
 Heal my heart and make it clean 
 Open up my eyes to the things unseen 
 Show me how to love like you have loved me 
 Break my heart from what breaks yours 
 Everything I am for your kingdoms cause 
 As I go from nothing to 
 Eternity 
 Hosanna in the highest

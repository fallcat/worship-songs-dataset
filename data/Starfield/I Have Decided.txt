I have decided to follow Jesus 
 No turning back, no turning back 
 I will follow you, I will follow you, I will follow you, my God 
 I will follow you, I will follow you, I will follow you, my God 
 Though none go with me, still I will follow 
 No turning back, no turning back 
 The world behind me, the cross before me 
 No turning back, no turning back

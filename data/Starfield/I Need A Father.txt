Hold me, somebody 
 Don't let me be alone 
 Love me, stay with me 
 I am dying to be known 
 My heart cries out 
 I need a Father 
 Whose love will never fail me 
 A friend like no other 
 Whose trusted arms will hold me 
 I need a Father 
 I am wounded 
 But I tuck the pain away 
 Free me, heal me 
 I don't want to be afraid 
 My heart cries out 
 I need a Father 
 Whose love will never fail me 
 A friend like no other 
 Whose trusted arms will hold me 
 Here's my heart, be tender, please 
 Let me know Your love for me 
 Here's my heart, I'm on my knees 
 I will trust 'cause I believe 
 You are my Father 
 Your love will never fail me 
 A friend like no other 
 Your trusted arms will hold me 
 You are my Father

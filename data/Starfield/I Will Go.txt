To the desperate eyes and reaching hands 
 To the suffering and the lean 
 To the ones the world has cast aside 
 Where you want me I will be 
 I will go, I will go 
 I will go, Lord send me 
 To the world, To the lost 
 To the poor and hungry 
 Take everything I am 
 I'm clay within your hands 
 I will go, I will go, send me 
 Let me not be blind with privilege 
 Give me eyes to see the pain 
 Let the blessing You've poured out on me 
 Not be spent on me in vain 
 Let this life be used for change 
 I wanna live for you 
 Go where you lead me 
 I wanna follow you 
 (Repeat 3x) 
 Send me! [4x]

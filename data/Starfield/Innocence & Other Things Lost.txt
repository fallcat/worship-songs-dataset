Things once certain, I no longer trust 
 My sure foundations have crumbled to dust 
 I would scale the highest height or search the depths 
 To find the path to innocence and wonder 
 I don't wanna lose my way 
 I don't wanna lose my faith 
 Revelation, great is Your cost 
 Truth has been gained but innocence lost 
 I would scale the highest height or search the depths 
 To find the path to innocence and wonder 
 I don't wanna lose my way 
 (It's a bitter fate, it's a heavy load) 
 (It's a mighty weight, it's a narrow road) 
 I don't wanna lose my faith 
 (It's a bitter fate, it's a heavy load) 
 (It's a mighty weight, it's a narrow road) 
 Narrow the road, small is the gate 
 It's getting harder to find, harder to find 
 Mighty the load, heavy the weight 
 Still I'm walking the line, holding the line 
 Gone is the sun into the night 
 It's getting harder to see, harder to see 
 Many the rules wrong from the right 
 They're getting harder to keep, harder to keep 
 Oh, how I've realized 
 All that I've compromised 
 I'm living in disguise

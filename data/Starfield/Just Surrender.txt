Life is hard and I know you're trying 
 You wear a smile but inside you're crying 
 When will you admit you'll never make it on your own? 
 You build the walls up all around you 
 To protect you from the hurt you've been through 
 I'm the only one who can bring the walls to the ground 
 Lay down your defenses, put your trust in me 
 I can heal your hurt 
 I can comfort you 
 Don't resist my love 
 Just surrender 
 I see your scars 
 And I feel your fear 
 Let me rescue you 
 Just surrender, just surrender 
 You keep denying my advances 
 But you'll never be out of chances 
 My love will follow you, no matter how far you run 
 Let me show you what you can be 
 What it's like to life this life free 
 Will you take my hand and let me lead you, my child? 
 Lay down your defenses, put your trust in me 
 Open up your heart and let me in 
 There's nothing left to fear

I know that there will come a day 
 We're all together in that place 
 But until then we gotta get along 
 Divided we're weak, as one we're strong 
 So everybody grab a hand 
 A house divided cannot stand 
 We can't show his love until 
 We're a shining city on a hill 
 If we all just come together, let our hearts collide 
 Then maybe we'll find, that the Light of the World will shine 
 To the depths of the darkest night 
 That the Light of the World will shine through us 
 And maybe we'll see, by our love, that the world believes 
 And the captives will be set free 
 That the Light of the World will shine through us 
 We're the salt and we're the light 
 A blazing fire in the night 
 Burning for the world to see 
 Burning that they might believe 
 So let this fire in you burn bright 
 Wave the flag and join the fight 
 A revolution is at hand, let's learn to love our fellow man 
 If we all just come together, let our hearts collide 
 If, as brothers and sisters, we would unify 
 Let it shine to the nations, let it cover the Earth 
 Through our lips as we worship, and our hands as we serve 
 The Light of the World will shine 
 The Light of the World will shine 
 The Light of the World will shine 
 The Light of the World will shine

Mark me with Your grace 
 Shape me in Your wisdom 
 Place in me a heart 
 Of mercy 
 Open up my eyes 
 Let me see Your glory 
 Lead me to the place 
 You want me 
 Love, break me now 
 Strip me down 
 May Your beauty 
 Deep inside of me resound 
 Through me be found 
 Come break me now, yeah 
 Guide me in Your truth 
 Mold me in Your nature 
 Birth in me a hope 
 To hold on 
 Show me how to wait 
 Teach me how to listen 
 Be in me the strength 
 To let go 
 Love, break me now 
 Strip me down 
 May Your beauty 
 Deep inside of me resound 
 Through me be found 
 Come break me now 
 Break me now... 
 Break me now... 
 Break me nowâ€¦ 
 Break me now... 
 Love, hear my plea 
 Rescue me, bring Your peace 
 I have come to You on bended knee 
 I'm desperate for Your breath in me 
 Your ears to hear, Your eyes to see 
 Set me free, come set me free 
 Like rain flowing over me... 
 Like rain flowing over me... 
 Like rain flowing over me... 
 Like rain flowing over me... 
 Like rain flowing over me... 
 Love, break me now 
 Strip me down 
 May Your beauty 
 Deep inside of me resound 
 Through me be found 
 Come break me now 
 Flowing over 
 Flowing over 
 Flowing over me 
 Flowing over 
 Flowing over 
 Flowing over me

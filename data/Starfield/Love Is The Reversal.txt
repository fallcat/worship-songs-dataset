Verse 1 Welcome to the worldwide train wreck 
 Welcome to the come undone 
 Welcome to the big rejection 
 Welcome to the hit and run 
 Where mercy cries for everyone 
 Yeah, nothing is as good as it should be 
 'Cause this is the rehearsal 
 Yeah, in between the was and the could be 
 Love is the reversal 
 I believe we're underwater 
 I believe the engine's blown 
 Yeah I believe our secret longings 
 Tell us that we're not at home 
 But grace reclaims what the world disowns 
 The reversal, the reversal, the reversal 
 Let love be the great reversal 
 You are the great reversal 
 Nothing is here, nothing is here for me 
 The redepmtion singing song of love over me 
 Nothing is here, nothing is here for me for me 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ahhhah

Love of another kind (b-side) 
 Starfield 
 I am purity 
 I am a king now 
 Receiving grace where once stood 
 Penalty and shame 
 I am survival 
 A constant battle 
 Between what I am 
 And what I long to be 
 Freedom has found me 
 Your love surrounds me 
 Your voice is the wind 
 Blowing through the trees 
 Your kiss is the rain 
 And it brings me to my knees 
 Into the courts of praise 
 I have come to find 
 Love of another kind 
 I am conviction 
 I am in process 
 I breathe the breath of God 
 The air of providence 
 I am a paradox 
 Liver of two lives 
 One for heaven 
 One the road along the way 
 Freedom has found me 
 Your love surrounds me 
 Your voice is the wind 
 Blowing through the trees 
 Your kiss is the rain 
 And it brings me to my knees 
 Into the courts of praise 
 I have come to find 
 Love of another kind 
 (Love of another kind) 
 To love the Lord your God with all 
 Your heart and soul and all your mind 
 (Repeat) 
 Your voice is the wind 
 Blowing through the trees 
 Your kiss is the rain 
 And it brings me to my knees 
 Into the fields of praise 
 I will run to find 
 Love of another kind

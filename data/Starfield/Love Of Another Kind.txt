Love of Another Kind 
 I am purity 
 Because of what You've done for me 
 Receiving grace where once stood 
 Penalty and shame 
 I am survival 
 A constant battle 
 Between what I am 
 And what I long to be 
 Freedom has found me 
 And Your love surrounds me 
 Your voice is the wind 
 Blowing through the trees 
 Your kiss is the rain 
 And it brings me to my knees 
 Into the courts of praise 
 I have come to find 
 The love of another kind 
 I am conviction 
 I am in process 
 I breathe the breath of God 
 The air of providence 
 I am a paradox 
 Liver of two lives 
 One for heaven, one the road 
 Along the way 
 To love the Lord your God 
 With all your heart and soul 
 And all your mind 
 (Is the love of another kind)

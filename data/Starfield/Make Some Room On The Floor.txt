Make some room on the floor 
 Start snappin' your fingers 
 Start moving your feet 
 Cause everybody's buggin' to this old school beat 
 Put your hands in the air 
 Make some room on the floor 
 We're gonna break it down 
 Like we've never ever done before 
 (Na na na na...) 
 The whole world's in on the action 
 So turn that frown around 
 It's the rhythm of the ages 
 Everybody's gettin' down 
 God put the boogie in ya 
 Gave you what you got to move it 
 So quit yakkin' 'bout your groove 
 I want to see you prove it 
 (Na na na na...) 
 Start snappin' your fingers 
 Start moving your feet 
 Cause everybody's boogyin' to this old school beat

There is something more 
 Hello, we're going down the hallway to the door 
 We know there's something more 
 Our soul has a got a hole 
 We know but what's it waiting for 
 Scattered in the street 
 Like dreams and destiny 
 The things we wanna be 
 Are scattered in the streets 
 If we're coming clean 
 We've seen to know we're incomplete 
 How do we feel, how do we feel 
 My generation is aching for real 
 Dyin' for love cryin for truth 
 My generation is aching for you 
 Country of our own 
 Is all we're asking for 
 A place to call our home 
 A country of our own 
 We know it must be close 
 Our souls are searching through the cold 
 The cold, the cold 
 How do we feel, how do we feel 
 My generation is aching for real 
 Dyin' for love, cryin for truth 
 My generation is aching for you

I cannot be broken 
 I cannot be tamed 
 My tongue is a fire and my words are a flame 
 I will burn and wither 
 I will stop for none 
 My will is a drought and my ego the sun 
 I'm the raging sea 
 I'm the bending trees 
 An unstoppable force with a wake of debris 
 I'm the wind and rain 
 I'm the loss and the pain 
 Without you, I'm a natural disaster 
 I will drown the city 
 I am out for blood 
 The levee's my conscience, and my pride is a flood 
 I'm a vicious cycle, always the same 
 When the storm has passed 
 Just emptiness and sorrow remain 
 I'm a natural disaster 
 I'm a natural disaster, I'm coming on faster 
 I'm a natural disaster, I'm coming on faster 
 There's nowhere to to turn nowhere to hide 
 Nowhere to run, run, run, run

Lord of every age 
 Author of our faith 
 The first, the last, the same 
 The name above all names 
 Crowning Majesty 
 Glorious Prince of Peace 
 Throned at God's right hand 
 The world at His command 
 The world at His command 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 How great You are 
 There is no other Savior 
 Every knee bows down 
 At Your renown 
 There is no other Savior 
 Merciful High Priest 
 Lover of the least 
 Generous and meek 
 Protector of the weak 
 Sacrificed to death 
 For us, Your final breath 
 You died, the world to save 
 To overcome the grave 
 To overcome the grave 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 How great You are 
 There is no other Savior 
 Every knee bows down 
 At Your renown 
 There is no other Savior 
 You will reign forever 
 You reign forever 
 You will reign forever 
 You reign forever 
 You will reign forever 
 You reign forever 
 You will reign forever 
 You reign forever 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 How great You are 
 There is no other Savior 
 Every knee bows down 
 At Your renown 
 There is no other Savior 
 Jesus, Lamb of God 
 How great You are 
 There is no other Savior 
 Every knee bows down 
 At Your renown 
 There is no other Savior

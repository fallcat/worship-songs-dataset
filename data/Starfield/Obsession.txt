I am fixed on You 
 As the world flies by 
 I have lost myself 
 In Your blinding light 
 This obsession is my call 
 Owning body mind and soul 
 All I live for is to know You and be known 
 This obsession makes me whole 
 I give in to its control 
 It consumes me like a fire within my bones 
 I am not my own 
 I have been erased 
 Like a canvas washed by the stokes of grace 
 You're my obsession 
 You're all I ever need 
 I'm Your possession

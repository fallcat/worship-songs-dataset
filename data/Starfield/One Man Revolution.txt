If I'm here all alone 
 If I'm left behind 
 If they spit in my face 
 If they hate my kind 
 I will rise above 
 I will live for love 
 I will answer to the call 
 For the bond between 
 For the depth unseen 
 For my God forsake it all 
 'Cause I'm a fire 
 I'm a flood 
 I'm a revolution 
 I am a war 
 Already won 
 I'm a revolution 
 When the world is at war 
 When the grace is gone 
 When the hungry lay dead 
 While the rich live on 
 I will rise above 
 I will live for love 
 I will answer to the call 
 For the bond between 
 For a depth unseen 
 For my God forsake it all 
 (Here I stand) 
 Open hands 
 Waiting for You 
 I won't back down 
 I'll live to speak Your truth

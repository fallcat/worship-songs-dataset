Take me an invade me, make me someone new. 
 Wake me from the dead and break me with the truth. 
 Move me and disturb me, interrupt my peace, tear open my heart, 
 And pul me to my knees. 
 There's a world outside, that is burning, while I'm turning blinded eyes, 
 While I stand by. 
 I won't survive, to live this ordinary life, 
 I'm not alive, to live this ordinary life. 
 And I will try, to see this world I live in. 
 With Your eyes, to love the world You've given, 
 With my life, to see this world I live in, 
 With Your eyes, to love the world You've given, 
 With my life...

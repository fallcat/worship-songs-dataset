After the words have all been said 
 After the songs are sung 
 I realize I've only but just begun 
 Trying to wrap my mind around 
 Extravagant love come down 
 Leaves me undone 
 Finds me with nothing to say 
 The reach of Your fame 
 The power in Your name 
 Your glory surrounds me 
 It's over my head 
 It's over my head 
 The shame of the cross 
 For all that it cost 
 This friendship astounds me 
 It's over my head 
 It's over my head 
 Unquenchable songs and endless praise 
 A million tongues poised to sing 
 Could still not convey 
 The worth that Your name deserves 
 Beauty for ashes 
 Joy for pain 
 Mercy instead of my blame 
 Ruins me for more 
 I'm lost in Your presence, Lord 
 Hallelujah... 
 Lost for the words to say 
 I'm left here in disarray 
 Waiting for You, waiting on truth 
 I've thrown reason overboard 
 Knowing that there's still more 
 I don't yet believe, I can't even perceive 
 I can't seem to understand 
 Can't seem to find my way 
 It's over my head, it's over my head 
 Learning this mystery 
 Trust what I cannot see 
 It's over my head, it's over my head 
 The wonder of all You've made 
 Foundations Your hands have laid 
 Bringing me back to my knees, to my knees 
 I'm lost for the words to say 
 Lost for another way 
 Bringing me back to my knees, to my knees 
 I'm lost for the words to say 
 Lost for another way 
 Ruined for anything other than Your love 
 I'm desperate to know You, Lord 
 Desperate for what's in store 
 Finding my hope in only You, in only You 
 Take me beyond this door 
 Lead me to something more 
 Open my heart up for more of You, more of You

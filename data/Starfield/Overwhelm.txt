This is an invitation 
 To overwhelm my heart 
 I'm asking You to meet me 
 I'm waiting here to start 
 My soul is like a desert 
 Thirsty for Your rain 
 So open up the Heavens 
 And fill me up again 
 I am ready for my life 
 To be consumed 
 Father, here I am 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Only Your love can 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Let Your spirit fall 
 Overtake it all 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm me 
 Desperate for Your presence 
 I long for You alone 
 So dwell within me, Jesus 
 This temple is Your home 
 I am ready for this life 
 To be consumed 
 Father, here I am 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Only Your love can 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Let Your spirit fall 
 Overtake it all 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm me 
 Father, here I am 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Only Your love can 
 Overwhelm 
 Father, here I am 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Only Your love can 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Let Your spirit fall 
 Overtake it all 
 Let Your spirit fall 
 Overtake it all 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm me 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm me 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, take me, heal me 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm 
 Overwhelm, overwhelm me

Quiet Waters 
 Tim Neufeld, Dave Miller 
 You have led me to the 
 Banks of quiet waters 
 I can still remember how 
 We'd walk and talk for hours 
 You would lead me 
 Past the outer courts 
 Into your secret place 
 Through the valley of the shadow 
 Along the straight and narrow road 
 But along the way somewhere 
 I lost sight of the promise 
 What used to be a childlike faith 
 Became a white-washed tomb 
 As I let my gaze fall on this 
 Fallen world around me 
 The injustice of it all 
 Won't let me let it go 
 And I don't know why 
 But still my hope is in you 
 All this may never make sense 
 But my eyes, my eyes are on you 
 And laying down my crown 
 And falling to my knees 
 I'm giving up the facade 
 That is becoming me 
 I've offered empty praise 
 And overused cliche's 
 For too long I've grown so tired of this game 
 I am so thirsty for more 
 I can't be satisfied 
 To sit along the rivers banks and wait 
 Somewhere inside of me 
 There's a hunger for what lies beneath the surface 
 I've spent so long just getting by 
 On borrowed faith and dead religion 
 I've come this far to only realize 
 I've not come far at all

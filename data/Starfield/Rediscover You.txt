I need to just admit my faith is paper thin 
 I'm feeling so burned out on religion 
 I say an empty prayer, I sing a tired song 
 I need to just admit that the passion's gone 
 And I wanna get it back 
 You told me, look for You and I will find 
 So I'm here like I'm searching for the first time 
 Revive me, Jesus, make this cold heart start to move 
 Help me rediscover 
 I wanna learn to pray the way that David prayed 
 I want my soul to burn when I hear Your name 
 I wanna feel like new, I wanna hunger for You 
 Bring me back to life like only You can do 
 'Cause I don't wanna stay the same 
 You told me, look for You and I will find 
 So I'm here like I'm searching for the first time 
 Revive me, Jesus, make this cold heart start to move 
 Help me rediscover You 
 Lord, I wanna be Yours today 
 I wanna know the passion of the saints 
 And how they were changed 
 You told me, look for You and I will find 
 So I'm here like I'm searching for the first time 
 Revive me, Jesus, make this cold heart start to move 
 I wanna burn for You, bring me back to life 
 Jesus, help me rediscover You

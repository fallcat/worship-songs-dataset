You thought of us before the world began to breathe 
 And you knew our names before we came to be 
 You saw the very day we'd fall away from you 
 And how desperately we need to be redeemed 
 Lord Jesus come lead us 
 We're desperate for your touch 
 Oh Great and Mighty One, with one desire we come 
 That you would reign, that you would reign in us 
 We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice 
 That you would reign, that you would reign in us 
 Spirit of the Living God fall fresh again 
 Come search our hearts and purify our lives 
 We need your perfect love 
 We need your discipline 
 We're lost unless you guide us with your light 
 Lord Jesus come lead us 
 We're desperate for your touch 
 We cry out 
 For your love to refine us cry out 
 For your love to define us cry out 
 For your mercy to keep us blameless until you return 
 You would reign in us 
 So reign, please reign in us 
 Come purify our hearts we need your touch 
 Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out 
 So the world may know you reign, you reign in us

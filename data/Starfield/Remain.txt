Defender of this heart 
 You loved me from the start 
 You never change 
 Through the highs and lows 
 As seasons come and go 
 You never fail 
 Day after day 
 Your love will remain 
 Faithful and true 
 You are good 
 You are God with us 
 You're victorious 
 You are strong and mighty to save 
 For Your word stands true 
 There is none like You 
 And when all else fades 
 You remain 
 When troubles come my way 
 You guide and You sustain 
 Lead me, I pray 
 Forever You will be 
 The great eternal King 
 Now and always 
 Day after day 
 Your love will remain 
 Faithful and true 
 You are good, you are good 
 When all else fades 
 You remain 
 You remain 
 Cause' day after day 
 You never change 
 Day after day 
 You are the same 
 Day after day 
 You remain

Returning 
 God it seems that You are drawn to our weakness 
 That You are motivated by our tears 
 And it seems ou're moved to mercy 
 Through repentance 
 With no hesitation loocking past the wasted years 
 At the prodical's sheepish returning 
 Expecting rejection and rehearsing his lines 
 He is met with the cross 
 Met only by the mercy of God 
 As it's poured out before him 
 I love the way the Father waits 
 Though met by arrogance and hate 
 How fire does fall and quench their yearning 
 I love to watch the lost returning 
 Though we seem to always choose the hard way 
 And just keep wandering in the wilderness 
 Outside the Promised Land 
 No amount of running from You 
 No height nor depth nor any power 
 Can ever separate us 
 Among all of Your creation 
 Of all the beauty to behold 
 There is nothing more beautiful 
 Nothing more sacred 
 Then a broken man 
 That's poured out before You 
 I love the way the Father waits 
 Though met by arrogance and hate 
 How fire does fall and quench their yearning 
 I love to watch the lost returning 
 I love to see the broken weeping 
 To see the dead awake from sleeping 
 How fire does fall and quench their yearning 
 I love to watch the lost returning 
 Where can we go from here? 
 Through so many miles and so many years 
 To the feet of Jesus 
 Where the wounded heart is found 
 There the grace of God abounds

If I'm here all alone, if I'm left behind. 
 If they spit in my face, if they hate my kind. 
 I will rise above, I will live for love, I will answer to the call. 
 For the bond between, for the depth unseen, 
 For my God forsake it all. 
 'Cause I'm a fire, I'm a flood, I'm a revolution (revolution) 
 I am a war, 
 Already won 
 I'm a revolution (revolution) yeah... 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 When, the world is at war, when the grace is gone, 
 When the hungry lay dead, while the rich live on, 
 I will rise above, I will live for love, I will answer to the call. 
 For the bond between, for a depth unseen, for my God forsake it all, 
 'Cause I'm a fire, I'm a flood, I'm a revolution (revolution) 
 I am a war, 
 Already won 
 I'm a revolution (revolution) 
 'Cause I'm a fire, I'm a flood, I'm a revolution (revolution) 
 I am a war, already won, I'm a revolution (revolution).

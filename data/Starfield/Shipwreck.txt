I built a fortress 
 With a hundred thousand faces 
 I'll keep it safe 
 With a hundred thousand more 
 But these masks are wearing thin 
 As You draw me in 
 I spent my time 
 On the empty and the fleeting 
 I spent my life 
 On much less than I'd dreamed 
 But I'm reaching out to you 
 To make me new 
 'Cause I am just a beggar here at Your door 
 I am just a shipwreck here on Your shore 
 I come empty handed 
 Ready to see 
 Your life in me changing who I've been 
 To who I need to be 
 You tell me my story 
 As You sift between the pages 
 I feel redemption 
 In the space between each turn 
 Could You take me in Your arms 
 And tell it just once more 
 Could You take me in Your arms 
 And tell it just once more

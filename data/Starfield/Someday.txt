Someday 
 Just like children we wait 
 With our hands outstretched 
 We live to decipher the good from the best 
 And though we are wretched, naked, and poor 
 We join with creation in groaning for more 
 Are we orphans? 
 Have you deserted your bride? 
 Have you forgotten, forgotten Your promises? 
 Hey, everythings gunna be okay 
 All of this is gunna make sense someday 
 We can't see the bigger picture anymore 
 Feels like we're all permanent residents on this floor 
 It's a mirage on the horizon 
 We can taste and touch and feel 
 We spend our whole lives turning to 
 Because it seems so real 
 Are we forgotten? 
 Has something better come along? 
 Will You remember, remember Your promises?

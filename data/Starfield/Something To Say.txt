I've got something to say 
 It's been one of those days 
 When I'm finding it hard to believe in You 
 I've got something to say 
 I've forgotten how to pray 
 And I'm finding it hard to believe the truth 
 I've got something to say 
 Right now it feels like You are slipping away 
 Like I am drowning in a crisis of faith 
 Like I'm alone 
 I've got something to say 
 What was black and white is gray 
 And I'm finding it hard to believe in You 
 I've got something to say 
 Right now it feels like You are slipping away 
 Like I am drowning in a crisis of faith 
 Like I'm alone 
 And faith might mean there won't be answers 
 And hope might mean enduring through the night 
 But help me not forget in darkness 
 The things that I believed in light 
 I've got something to say 
 Right now it feels like You are slipping away 
 Like I am drowning in a crisis of faith 
 Like I was found but now I'm lost in the fray 
 I've got something to say 
 It's been one of those days 
 When I'm finding it hard to believe in You

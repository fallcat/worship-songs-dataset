Son of God 
 Shaper of the stars 
 You alone 
 The dweller of my heart 
 Mighty King 
 How beautiful You are, how beautiful 
 Son of God 
 The Father's gift to us 
 You alone 
 Were broken on the alter of love 
 Precious Lamb 
 Our freedom's in Your blood, It's in your blood 
 Jesus, Oh Holy One 
 I sing to You 
 Forgiven 
 Savior, I'm overcome 
 With Your great love for me 
 Son of God 
 Strenght beyond compare 
 You alone 
 The darkness cannot bear 
 Lord of love 
 Your kindness draws me near, it draws me 
 Son of God 
 Prophecy of old 
 You alone 
 Redeemer of my soul 
 Come again 
 And lead your people home, come lead us home 
 You are worthy 
 You are worthy 
 You are worthy of all my praise 
 You are beautiful 
 You are beautiful 
 I will lift up my hands and sing

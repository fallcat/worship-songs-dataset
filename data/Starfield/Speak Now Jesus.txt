Say the words and I will listen 
 Show your way, impart your wisdom 
 Open up my ears to hear, open up my ears to hear 
 Speak now, Jesus, speak into my heart 
 I am desperate to hear your still small voice 
 I need to hear your voice 
 The noise of life is overwhelming 
 Drowning out the truth that I need 
 Open up my ears to hear, open up my ears to hear 
 Speak now, Jesus, speak into my heart 
 I am desperate to hear your still small voice 
 I need to hear your voice 
 Lead me, Jesus, I need direction 
 I am so lost, without you guiding me 
 I need to know your peace 
 When you speak, I'll listen 
 Where you lead, I'll go

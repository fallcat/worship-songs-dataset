No greater joy 
 Is there than this 
 To know for what 
 We're meant to live 
 To hold Your hand 
 To touch Your face 
 To find ourselves 
 In loves embrace 
 I want to stand before the King 
 Join in the song that heaven sings 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 I want to know the mystery 
 Reach out and touch the majesty 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 (I want to hold the hand that holds the world) 
 No greater love 
 Could be bestowed 
 That You would name us as your own 
 Your daughters sing 
 Your sons rejoice 
 They gather here before Your throne 
 I want to stand before the King 
 Join in the song that heaven sings 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 I want to know the mystery 
 Reach out and touch the majesty 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 (I want to hold the hand that holds the world) 
 You are, You are 
 The author of creation 
 We are, the chrildren of your heart 
 You are, You are, 
 The light of all the heaven 
 We rise, to worship all You are 
 I want to stand before the King 
 Join in the song that heaven sings 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 I want to know the mystery 
 Reach out and touch the majesty 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 (I want to hold the hand that holds the world) 
 I want to stand before the King 
 Join in the song that heaven sings 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 I want to know the mystery 
 Reach out and touch the majesty 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 (I want to hold the hand that holds the world) 
 I want to hold the hand 
 Reach out and hold the hand 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world 
 I want to hold the hand 
 I want to hold the hand 
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world

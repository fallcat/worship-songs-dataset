Oh Oh Oh 
 We have come to testify 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Our God is surely great 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 His love is like a river wide 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 So let everyone beneath his skies 
 Lift their voice and sing 
 For the kingdom of our God 
 Carries on 
 Carries on 
 Carries on 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 His kingdom is inside of you 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 It's everywhere you are 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Celebrate your life made new 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Come on let his freedom bloom 
 Lift your voice and sing 
 For the kingdom of our God 
 Carries on 
 Carries on 
 Carries on 
 Everybody sing, "Hallelujah"

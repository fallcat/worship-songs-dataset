What could we bring that You'd ever need? (that You'd ever need) 
 What could we do that's worthy of You? (that's worthy of You) 
 What could we say that You have never heard? 
 Sung by angels in heaven and earth 
 The loveliest song is the song on the lips of the broken and this is 
 The loveliest sound when Your children cry out we were lost now we're found 
 The loveliest sound to You is the sound we're making now 
 Merciful one there's nothing we've done (nothing we've done) 
 To ever deserve to be heard (to be heard) 
 But You bend Your ear to the sound of our voice 
 So let it rise up above every noise 
 Now let it rise up above every noise 
 Who are we that You look on us? 
 Our offering is a song of love 
 How can it be You delight in us? 
 In what we bring 'cause it's not enough 
 (Who are we that You look on us with love?) 
 (Repeat x2) 
 No it's not enough 
 The loveliest sound (crying out, we're crying out, the children cry for you) 
 The loveliest sound (the loveliest, the loveliest, the loveliest sound) 
 The loveliest song is the song on the lips of the broken and this is 
 The loveliest sound when Your children cry out we were lost now we're found 
 The loveliest song is the song on the lips of the broken and this is 
 The loveliest sound when Your children cry out we were lost now we're found 
 The loveliest sound to You is the sound we're making 
 It's the sound You're longing for

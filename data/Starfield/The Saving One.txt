What mercy was revealed 
 What selflessness and peace 
 My fate was surely sealed 
 Until He rescued me 
 His pardon for my sin 
 His bounty for my need 
 From slavery and shame 
 I am redeemed 
 And Heaven can't contain 
 The glory of the Son 
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One 
 His love has made a way 
 The grave is overcome 
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One 
 No fear can hold me down 
 Nor darkness steal my joy 
 For blood has been poured out 
 The enemy destroyed 
 Death could not hold Him down 
 The cross was not enough 
 To steal away His throne 
 For He is God 
 And Heaven can't contain 
 The glory of the Son 
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One 
 His love has made a way 
 The grave is overcome 
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One 
 Anyone who calls upon His name 
 They will be saved 
 They will be saved 
 Anyone who calls upon His name 
 They will be saved 
 They will be saved 
 And Heaven can't contain 
 The glory of the Son 
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One 
 His love has made a way 
 The grave is overcome 
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One 
 Anyone who calls upon His name 
 They will be saved 
 They will be saved 
 Anyone who calls upon His name 
 They will be saved 
 They will be saved

Don't let your mind deny 
 What your heart believes 
 Leave your inhibitions 
 Let your soul be free 
 This is why you were created 
 It's your destiny 
 It's alright 
 It's alright 
 It's alright 
 Who the Son sets free 
 Yeah, they are free indeed 
 So let go with me 
 Come on and sing what you believe 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs 
 We're gonna dance for the glory 
 Of the risen Son 
 We're not ashamed, not ashamed 
 Of the One we love 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs 
 This is the praise of a people 
 That have been redeemed 
 This is the joy of the Lord 
 And the sound of the free 
 This is why we were created 
 It's our destiny 
 It's alright 
 It's alright 
 It's alright 
 Who the Son sets free 
 Yeah, they are free indeed 
 So let go with me 
 Come on and sing what you believe 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs 
 We're gonna dance for the glory 
 Of the risen Son 
 We're not ashamed, not ashamed 
 Of the One we love 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs 
 We're gonna dance for the glory 
 Of the risen Son 
 We're not ashamed, not ashamed 
 Of the One we love 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs 
 We're gonna dance for the glory 
 Of the risen Son 
 We're not ashamed, not ashamed 
 Of the One we love 
 We're gonna shout His praise 
 At the top of our lungs

Tumbling After 
 The other day when I was driving home 
 My world was shaken 
 It occurred to me that I had left 
 Too many risks untaken 
 I'm always sitting here just waiting for the revelation 
 Is it ever gonna come? 
 All this searching yet my destiny is still unfound 
 Makes me realize if this world will always let me down 
 So it seems the only hope I ever had 
 Was everything that You are 
 I'm falling down 
 Tumbling after You 
 I'm overwhelmed 
 Tripping over simple truth 
 In all I've found 
 There's nothing that's more beautiful 
 Then what I've found in You 
 You could always see right through 
 The front I'd offer You 
 Not believing my excuses waiting for the truth 
 When You could have turned Your back 
 And walked away from me 
 You picked me up instead 
 So I'll turn another page, 
 And change the way I look at You 
 And maybe I'll begin to understand 
 What You went through 
 Not content to leave me wandering and unaware 
 You took my hand instead 
 Ya You lead me to the edge 
 You're everything that I ever needed 
 And I wanna believe this time 
 That You would love me 
 That You would say I'm Yours

I have not much 
 To offer You 
 Not near what You deserve 
 But still I come 
 Because Your cross 
 Has placed in me my worth 
 Oh, Christ my King 
 Of sympathy 
 Whose wounds secure my peace 
 Your grace extends 
 To call me friend 
 Your mercy sets me free 
 And I know I'm weak 
 I know I'm unworthy 
 To call upon Your name 
 But because of grace 
 Because of Your mercy 
 I stand here unashamed 
 I can't explain 
 This kind of love 
 I'm humbled and amazed 
 That You'd come down 
 From heavens heights 
 And greet me face to face 
 Here I am at Your feet 
 In my brokeness complete

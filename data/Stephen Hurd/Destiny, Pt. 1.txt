What's the plan that You have for me? 
 The place You've called me to be 
 Some people call it destiny 
 Will You let me know 
 What's the plight that You've called me to 
 The thing I'm set aside to do 
 I trust You, Lord, to see me through 
 Will You let me look in Your heart 
 Lord, hear my plea 
 Reveal to me the mysteries 
 And the plan You have for me 
 This prayer is from me 
 Make known to me the mysteries 
 And the plan You have for me 
 Destiny 
 Thank You 
 (Thank You) 
 For showing me 
 (For showing me) 
 And directing me 
 (Directing me) 
 To my destiny 
 (To my destiny) 
 Tell the Lord thank You 
 (Thank You) 
 For showing me 
 (For showing me) 
 And directing me 
 (Directing me) 
 To my destiny 
 (To my destiny) 
 I know what I'm here for 
 Thank You for showing me 
 Directing me to my destiny 
 I know what I'm here for 
 Thank You for showing me 
 Directing me to my destiny 
 I know what I'm here for 
 Thank You for showing me 
 Directing me to my destiny 
 I know what I'm here for 
 Thank You for showing me 
 Directing me to my destiny 
 I know what I'm here for 
 I know what I'm here for 
 I know what I'm here for

All my days I will sing this song of gladness 
 Give my praise to the Fountain of delights 
 For in my helplessness You heard my cry 
 And waves of mercy poured down on my life 
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer 
 I will sing of the blood that never fails 
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed 
 Of death defeated and life without end 
 Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counsellor 
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history 
 You're the Way, the Truth, the Life 
 Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness 
 You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion 
 And You reign, You reign over all 
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer 
 I will sing of the blood that never fails 
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed 
 Of death defeated and life without end 
 Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counsellor 
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history 
 You're the Way, the Truth, the Life 
 Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness 
 You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion 
 And You reign, You reign over all 
 I long to be where the praise is never-ending 
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades 
 Where countless worshippers will share one song 
 And cries of 'worthy' will honour the Lamb! 
 Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counsellor 
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history 
 You're the Way, the Truth, the Life 
 Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness 
 You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion 
 And You reign, You reign over all

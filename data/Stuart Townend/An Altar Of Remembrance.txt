An altar of remembrance 
 Is what I bring to you 
 An overflow of thankfulness 
 For all you've brought me through 
 The power of Your love for me 
 In famine and in feast 
 Unnumbered blessings poured on me 
 The greatest to the least 
 An altar of remembrance 
 I'm building every day 
 Each act of Your unfailing grace 
 Each answer to my when I pray 
 So faithful to this faithless one 
 So patient with my pride 
 Complete in me what You've begun 
 A portrait of the Christ 
 Take my life and let it be 
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee 
 My ev'ry thought, my ev'ry deed 
 An offering to you 
 An altar of remembrance 
 That stands for years to come 
 When I am called to heaven's rest 
 My story lingers on 
 Let those who follow on the way 
 Take courage in the race 
 You fashioned from this jar of clay 
 A trophy of Your grace

Bless√®d Spirit of the King 
 Of grace and love the Author 
 Work repentance deep within 
 And bend me at Your altar 
 Melt my heart with majesty 
 Then show my ruined self to me 
 Teach me to more clearly see 
 Your might and will to save me 
 Here I place without reserve 
 My soul in faith and meekness 
 Trusting in Christ's power and love 
 To flourish in my weakness 
 Cause my days on earth to be 
 Through time and through eternity 
 A trophy of His victory 
 A monument to mercy 
 Teach me to behold my God 
 And trust His power to save me 
 Arms outstretched in constant love 
 Whose strength will never fail me 
 Help me to commune with Him 
 Depend and follow after Him 
 That through my life His peace will reign 
 And joy be my companion

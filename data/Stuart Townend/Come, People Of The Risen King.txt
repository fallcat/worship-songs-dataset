Come, people of the Risen King, 
 Who delight to bring Him praise; 
 Come all and tune your hearts to sing 
 To the Morning Star of grace. 
 From the shifting shadows of the earth 
 We will lift our eyes to Him, 
 Where steady arms of mercy reach 
 To gather children in. 
 Rejoice, Rejoice! Let every tongue rejoice! 
 One heart, one voice; O Church of Christ, rejoice! 
 Come, those whose joy is morning sun, 
 And those weeping through the night; 
 Come, those who tell of battles won, 
 And those struggling in the fight. 
 For His perfect love will never change, 
 And His mercies never cease, 
 But follow us through all our days 
 With the certain hope of peace. 
 Come, young and old from every land - 
 Men and women of the faith; 
 Come, those with full or empty hands - 
 Find the riches of His grace. 
 Over all the world, His people sing - 
 Shore to shore we hear them call 
 The Truth that cries through every age: 
 "Our God is all in all"!

For every child who lies 
 Still beneath his mother's eyes 
 She's asking why a God of love 
 Would give then take away 
 For every self-made man 
 Doing everything he can 
 To fill the void that's deep within 
 Eating at his soul 
 Oh, have mercy... 
 Oh, have mercy on us all 
 For every wife who cries 
 When her husband's lying eyes 
 Give the sordid game away 
 And something dies within 
 For those who walk the streets 
 Destitute and desperate 
 We shake our heads and wash our hands 
 And hurry on our way 
 Oh, have mercy 
 Have mercy on us all 
 Lord, have mercy 
 Lord, have mercy 
 Lord, have mercy 
 Have mercy on us all 
 Lord, have mercy 
 Christ have mercy 
 Lord, have mercy 
 Have mercy on us all 
 O God, forgive us for the wrong that we have done 
 Night is filled with weeping and we're aching for the dawn 
 O God of love this world has suffered for so long 
 Have mercy on us all 
 Forgive our driven need 
 To make a virtue out of greed 
 We've set our hearts on worldly things 
 That cannot satisfy 
 We've used tomorrow's gold today 
 While nature chokes along the way 
 How many years before we pay? 
 Perhaps we're paying now?

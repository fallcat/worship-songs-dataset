From the squalor of a borrowed stable 
 By the Spirit and a virgin's faith 
 To the anguish and the shame of scandal 
 Came the Saviour of the human race 
 But the skies were filled with the praise of heaven 
 Shepherds listen as the angels tell 
 Of the Gift of God come down to man 
 At the dawning of Immanuel 
 King of heaven now the Friend of sinners 
 Humble servant in the Father's hands 
 Filled with power and the Holy Spirit 
 Filled with mercy for the broken man 
 Yes, He walked my road and He felt my pain 
 Joys and sorrows that I know so well 
 Yet His righteous steps give me hope again 
 I will follow my Immanuel 
 Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal 
 He was lifted on a cruel cross 
 He was punished for a world's transgressions 
 He was suffering to save the lost 
 He fights for breath, He fights for me 
 Loosing sinners from the claims of hell 
 And with a shout our souls are free 
 Death defeated by Immanuel 
 Now He's standing in the place of honour 
 Crowned with glory on the highest throne 
 Interceding for His own beloved 
 Till His Father calls to bring them home 
 Then the skies will part as the trumpet sounds 
 Hope of heaven or the fear of hell 
 But the Bride will run to her Lover's arms 
 Giving glory to Immanuel

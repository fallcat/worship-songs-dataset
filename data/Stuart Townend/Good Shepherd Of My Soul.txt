Good Shepherd of my soul 
 Come dwell within me 
 Take all I am and mould 
 Your likeness in me 
 Before the cross of Christ 
 This is my sacrifice 
 A life laid down and ready to follow 
 The troubled find their peace 
 In true surrender 
 The prisoners their release 
 From chains of anger 
 In springs of living grace 
 I find a resting place 
 To rise refreshed and ready to follow 
 I’ll walk this narrow road 
 With Christ before me 
 Where thorns and thistles grow 
 And cords ensnare me 
 Though doubted and denied 
 He never leaves my side 
 But lifts my head and calls me to follow 
 And when my days are gone 
 My strength is failing 
 He’ll carry me along 
 Through death’s unveiling 
 Earth’s struggles overcome 
 Heaven’s journey just begun 
 To search Christ’s depths and ever to follow

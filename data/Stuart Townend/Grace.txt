Lord, I'm grateful 
 Amazed at what You've done 
 My finest efforts are filthy rags 
 But I'm made righteous 
 By trusting in the Son 
 I have God's riches at Christ's expense! 
 'Cause it's grace! 
 There's nothing I can do 
 To make You love me more, 
 To make You love me less than You do 
 And by faith 
 I'm standing on this Stone 
 Of Christ and Christ alone 
 Your righteousness is all that I need 
 'Cause it's grace! 
 Called and chosen 
 When I was far away 
 You brought me into Your family 
 Free, forgiven 
 My guilt is washed away 
 Your loving kindness is life to me 
 Freely given 
 But bought with priceless blood 
 My life was ransomed at Calvary 
 There my Jesus 
 Gave everything He could 
 That I might live for eternity 
 Grace loves the sinner 
 Loves all I am and all I'll ever be 
 Makes me a winner 
 Whatever lies the devil throws at me

I have heard that you are swift to bless the seeker 
 And I believe that You will hear the constant cry 
 So I will call until I know I've had an answer 
 I need Your power Lord 
 As Jacob wrestled so I'll wrestle with Your angel 
 And though I'm weary, I will not be overcome 
 For You have given me a passion for Your kingdom 
 O let Your glory fall 
 I won't let go 
 I won't let go until You bless me 
 I won't take no for an answer 
 Jesus, I won't let go 
 I have heard that You show mercy to a nation 
 And I believe that You give power to Your church 
 So now I'm asking You to open up the heavens 
 Pour out Your mercy, Lord 
 For Your gospel to be lived among Your people 
 For Your miracle of healing on the streets 
 For the government to fear the Lord Almighty 
 We need Your power, Lord 
 I'm not ungrateful for the blessings You have given 
 But I can see the need around me 
 I'm not ashamed to say I need all that You have 
 So Father, hear me knocking 
 See me holding out my hands to You 
 For a hunger that will overcome my weakness 
 For a love that will not seek it's own reward 
 For my life to make a difference in this nation 
 I need Your power, Lord

I will sing of the lamb 
 Of the price that was paid for me 
 Purchased by God 
 Giving all He could give 
 Here now I stand 
 In the garments of righteousness 
 Death has no hold, for in Jesus I live 
 I will sing of His blood 
 That flows for my wretchedness 
 Wounds that are bared 
 That I may be healed 
 Power and compassion 
 The marks of His ministry 
 May they be mine as I harvest His field 
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb 
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb 
 My heart fills with wonder 
 My mouth fills with praise 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Once I was blind 
 Yet believed I saw everything 
 Proud in my ways 
 Yet a fool in my part 
 Lost and alone 
 In the company of multitudes 
 Life in my body, yet death in my heart 
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb 
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb 
 Oh, why should the King 
 Save a sinner like me? 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 What shall I give 
 To the Man who gave everything 
 Humbling Himself 
 Before all He had made? 
 Dare I withhold 
 My own life from His sovereignty? 
 I shall give all for the sake of His name 
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb 
 Oh, I will sing of the Lamb 
 I'll sing of His love 
 For the rest of my days 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah

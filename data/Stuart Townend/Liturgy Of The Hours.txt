With ev'ry morning I will kneel to pray 
 To be a blessing in this coming day 
 In ev'rything I say and ev'rything I do 
 To wholly honour you 
 At noon remind me through this day to give 
 My full attention to the ones I'm with 
 Be mindful of those things around and those within 
 And fully enter in 
 Teach me the wisdom of remembering 
 And give me the wisdom to forget 
 Lead me 
 Oh, teach me 
 To live each day for you 
 And in the evening as my thoughts retell 
 This passing day let me remember well 
 So that no bitterness takes root within my soul 
 Help me to let them go 
 And in the night-time may my mind be free 
 To truly rest and be refreshed in sleep 
 And by releasing every worry, every strain 
 Be free to start again 
 Christ be with me, Christ within me 
 Christ behind me and before 
 Christ beside me, Christ to win me 
 Christ to comfort and restore 
 Christ beneath me, Christ above me 
 Christ in peace and Christ in storm 
 Christ in hearts of all who know me 
 Christ in friend and stranger all

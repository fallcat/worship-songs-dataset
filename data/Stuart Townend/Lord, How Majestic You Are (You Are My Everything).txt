Lord, how majestic you are 
 My eyes meet Your gaze 
 And my burden is lifted. 
 Your word is a l to my feet 
 Your hand swift to bless 
 And Your banner a shield 
 You are my everything 
 You who made earth and sky and sea 
 All that You've placed inside of me 
 Calls out Your name 
 To You, I bow 
 The King who commands my every breath 
 The Man who has conquered sin and death 
 My Lord and my King 
 My everything 
 Lord, how resplendent You are 
 When I think of Your heavens 
 The work of Your fingers 
 What is man, that You are mindful of him? 
 Yet You've crowned him with glory 
 And caused him to reign?

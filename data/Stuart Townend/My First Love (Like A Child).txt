My first love is a blazing fire 
 I feel His powerful love in me 
 For He has kindled a flame of passion 
 And I will let it grow in me 
 And in the night I will sing Your praise, my love 
 And in the morning I'll seek Your face, my love 
 Like a child I will dance in Your presence 
 Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me 
 Still remember the first day I met You 
 And I don't ever want to lose that fire 
 My first love 
 My first love is a rushing river 
 A waterfall that will never cease 
 And in the torrent of tears and laughter 
 I feel a healing power released 
 And I will draw from Your well of life, my love 
 And in Your grace I'll be satisfied, my love 
 Like a child I will dance in Your presence 
 Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me 
 I still remember the first day I met You 
 I don't ever want to lose that fire 
 Like a child I will dance in Your presence 
 Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me 
 I still remember the first day I met You 
 And I don't ever want to lose that fire: 
 My first love; my first love; my first love 
 Restore the years of the church's slumber 
 Revive the fire that has grown so dim 
 Renew the love of those first encounters 
 That we may come alive again 
 (That we may come alive again.) 
 We will rise like the dawn throughout the earth 
 'Til the trumpet announces Your return 
 Like a child I will dance in Your presence 
 Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me 
 I still remember the first day I met You 
 I don't ever want to lose that fire 
 Like a child I will dance in Your presence 
 Oh, let the joy of heaven pour down on me 
 I still remember the first day I met You 
 And I don't ever want to lose that fire: 
 My first love; my first love; my first love 
 my first love; my first love; my first love 
 my first love; my first love

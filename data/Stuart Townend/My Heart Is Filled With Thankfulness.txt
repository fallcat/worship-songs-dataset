My heart is filled with thankfulness 
 To Him who bore my pain; 
 Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace 
 And gave me life again; 
 Who crushed my curse of sinfulness 
 And clothed me in His light 
 And wrote His law of righteousness 
 With pow'r upon my heart. 
 My heart is filled with thankfulness 
 To Him who walks beside; 
 Who floods my weaknesses with strength 
 And causes fears to fly; 
 Whose ev'ry promise is enough 
 For ev'ry step I take, 
 Sustaining me with arms of love 
 And crowning me with grace. 
 My heart is filled with thankfulness 
 To him who reigns above, 
 Whose wisdom is my perfect peace, 
 Whose ev'ry thought is love. 
 For ev'ry day I have on earth 
 Is given by the King; 
 So I will give my life, my all, 
 To love and follow him.

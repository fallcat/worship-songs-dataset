O Church of Christ, invincible 
 The people of the Lord 
 Empowered by the Spirit’s breath 
 And nourished by his word 
 His covenant of grace will be 
 Our portion evermore 
 For He who called us will not change 
 Our help and our reward 
 O chosen people called by grace 
 The sons of Abraham 
 Who walk by faith and things unseen 
 And on His promise stand 
 That every nation of the earth 
 Will hear about this love 
 That causes broken hearts to heal 
 And pays our debts with blood 
 O Church of Christ in sorrow now 
 Where evil lies in wait 
 When trials and persecutions come 
 This light will never fade 
 For though the hordes of hell may rage 
 Their power will not endure 
 Our times are in the Father’s hand 
 Our anchor is secure 
 O Church of Christ, upon that day 
 When all are gathered in 
 When every tear is wiped away 
 With every trace of sin 
 Where justice, truth and beauty shine 
 And death is passed away 
 Where God and man will dwell as one 
 For all eternity

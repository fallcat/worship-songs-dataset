O Church Arise and put your armour on 
 Hear the call of Christ our Captain 
 For now the weak can say that they are strong 
 In the strength that God has given 
 With shield of faith and belt of truth 
 We'll stand against the devil's lies 
 An army bold whose battle-cry is Love 
 Reaching out to those in darkness 
 Our call to war to love the captive soul 
 But to rage against the captor 
 And with the sword that makes the wounded whole 
 We will fight with faith and valour 
 When faced with trials on every side 
 We know the outcome is secure 
 And Christ will have the prize for which He died 
 An inheritance of nations 
 Come see the cross where love and mercy meet 
 As the Son of God is stricken 
 Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet 
 For the Conqueror has risen 
 And as the stone is rolled away 
 And Christ emerges from the grave 
 This victory march continues till the day 
 Every eye and heart shall see Him 
 So Spirit come put strength in every stride 
 Give grace for every hurdle 
 That we may run with faith to win the prize 
 Of a servant good and faithful 
 As saints of old still line the way 
 Retelling triumphs of His grace 
 We hear their calls and hunger for the day 
 When with Christ we stand in glory

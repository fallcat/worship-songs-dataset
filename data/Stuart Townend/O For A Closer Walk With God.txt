O for a closer walk with God, 
 A calm and heavenly frame, 
 A light to shine upon the road 
 Leading to the Lamb. 
 Where is that bless√®dness I knew 
 When I first saw the Lord? 
 Where is that soul-refreshing view 
 Of Jesus and His word? 
 O Fire of God, come burn in me 
 Renew a holy passion 
 Till Christ my deepest longing be 
 My never-failing fountain 
 My never-failing fountain 
 What peaceful hours I once enjoyed, 
 How sweet the memory still! 
 But they have left an aching void 
 The world can never fill! 
 O Fire of God, come burn in me 
 Renew a holy passion 
 Till Christ my deepest longing be 
 My never-failing fountain 
 My never-failing fountain 
 The dearest idol I have known, 
 Whate'er that idol be, 
 Help me tear if from Thy throne, 
 And worship only Thee. 
 So shall my walk be close with God, 
 Calm and serene my frame; 
 So purer light shall mark the road 
 That leads me to the Lamb. 
 O Fire of God, come burn in me 
 Renew a holy passion 
 Till Christ my deepest longing be 
 My never-failing fountain 
 My never-failing fountain

O My Soul, arise and bless your Maker, 
 For He is your Master and your Friend. 
 Slow to wrath but rich in tender mercy; 
 Worship the Saviour, Jesus. 
 King of grace, His love is overwhelming; 
 Bread of Life, He's all I'll ever need, 
 For His blood has purchased me forever: 
 Bought at the cross of Jesus. 
 And I will sing for all my days 
 Of heaven's love come down. 
 Each breath I take will speak His praise 
 Until He calls me home. 
 When I wake, I know that He is with me; 
 When I'm weak, I know that He is strong. 
 Though I fall, His arm is there to lean on: 
 Safe on the Rock of Jesus. 
 Stir in me the songs that You are singing; 
 Fill my gaze with things as yet unseen. 
 Give me faith to move in works of power, 
 Making me more like Jesus. 
 Then one day I'll see Him as He sees me, 
 Face to face, the Lover and the loved; 
 No more words, the longing will be over: 
 There with my precious Jesus.

Oh how good it is when the family of God 
 Dwell together in spirit, in love and unity 
 Where the bonds of peace, of acceptance and love 
 Are the fruits of his presence here among us 
 So with one voice we'll sing to the Lord 
 And with one heart we'll live out his word 
 Til the whole world sees the Redeemer has come 
 For he dwells in the presence of his people 
 Oh how good it is on this journey we share 
 To rejoice with the happy and weep with those who mourn 
 For the weak find strength, the afflicted find grace 
 When we offer the blessing of belonging 
 Oh how good it is to embrace his command 
 To prefer one another, forgive as he forgives 
 When we live as one we all share in the love 
 Of the Son with the Father and the Spirit

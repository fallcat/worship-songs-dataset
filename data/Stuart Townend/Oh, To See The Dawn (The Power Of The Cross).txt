Oh, to see the dawn 
 Of the darkest day 
 Christ on the road to Calvary 
 Tried by sinful men 
 Torn and beaten, then 
 Nailed to a cross of wood 
 This, the power of the cross 
 Christ became sin for us 
 Took the blame, bore the wrath 
 We stand forgiven at the cross 
 Oh, to see the pain 
 Written on Your face 
 Bearing the awesome weight of sin 
 Every bitter thought 
 Every evil deed 
 Crowning Your bloodstained brow 
 Now the daylight flees 
 Now the ground beneath 
 Quakes as its Maker bows His head 
 Curtain torn in two 
 Dead are raised to life 
 'Finished!' the victory cry 
 Oh, to see my name 
 Written in the wounds 
 For through Your suffering I am free 
 Death is crushed to death 
 Life is mine to live 
 Won through Your selfless love 
 This, the power of the cross 
 Son of God, slain for us 
 What a love! What a cost 
 We stand forgiven at the cross

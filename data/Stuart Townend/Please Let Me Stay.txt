Please let me stay, 
 Let me rest in Your arms of love. 
 Please be my King, 
 Be my love, be my everything. 
 For this is love and this is grace; 
 Not that I loved Him but He loved me. 
 It's undeserved: this priceless love 
 Streaming all over me. 
 For this is love and this is grace; 
 Not that I loved You but You loved me. 
 It's undeserved: this priceless love 
 Streaming all over me.

God's saints of old 
 Through history told 
 Of the One who was to come 
 A son, a king 
 A Lamb to be slain 
 For the sins of all the world 
 He's the Promise of the Ages 
 Lifted up to save us 
 Jesus Christ, our sacrifice 
 He's the Fount of living water 
 King and Friend forever 
 Bow before 
 The Promise of the Ages 
 In flesh he came 
 Yet chose to remain 
 With the outcast and the poor 
 He bled, he died 
 Was raised, glorified 
 Now he lives forever more 
 Lift your hands and sing 'hallelujah 
 To the King of all the earth 
 Raise your voice and sing â€˜hallelujah 
 To the King of all the earth 
 How long until 
 The earth will be filled 
 With the knowledge of the Lord 
 When he shall come 
 When nations and tongues 
 Will be joined in glorious song

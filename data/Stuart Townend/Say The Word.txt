Say the word, I will be healed 
 You are the great Physician 
 You meet every need 
 Say the word, I will be free 
 Where chains have held me captive 
 Come sing Your songs to me 
 Say the word 
 Say the word, I will be filled 
 My hands reach out to heaven 
 Where striving is stilled 
 Say the word, I will be changed 
 Where I am dry and thirsty 
 Send cool, refreshing rain 
 Say the word 
 His tears have fallen like rain on my life 
 Each drop a fresh revelation 
 I will return to the place of the cross 
 Where grace and mercy 
 Pour from heavenâ€™s throne 
 Say the word, I will be poor 
 That I might know the riches 
 That You have in store 
 Say the word, I will be weak 
 Your strength will be the power 
 That satisfies the meek 
 Say the word 
 The Lord will see the travail of His soul 
 And He and I will be satisfied 
 Complete the work You have started in me 
 O, come Lord Jesus, shake my life again

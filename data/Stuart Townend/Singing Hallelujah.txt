Join the song 
 Of the angels round the throne 
 Giving worship to the One 
 Who lived and died 
 And lives forever more 
 All unite 
 With the saints who fought the fight 
 Resting now in heavenâ€™s light 
 Where beauty dwells 
 And suffering is no more 
 Now their suffering is no more 
 Singing hallelujah 
 Glory to the Saviour 
 Singing hallelujah to the Lamb 
 How I long 
 For the day when flesh is done 
 Fear and hate are overcome 
 And all the earth 
 Is freed from grief and pain 
 On that day 
 Every eye will meet his gaze 
 Sin and death will flee away 
 As we behold the glory of the Lord 
 We will bow before our God 
 Worthy, worthy, worthy 
 All the saints adore Thee 
 Singing hallelujah to the Lamb

Lord, we stand in the shallows of all you have given, 
 Grateful for mercy yet hungry for more, 
 For the power of grace to go out from this place 
 To the ends of the earth. 
 We have praised you with passion and worshipped in wonder, 
 Thrilled by your Spirit and fed by your word. 
 Now to fully delight in the riches of Christ 
 We must go to the world. 
 For you live in the streets of the city, 
 You stand with the weak and the needy, 
 You walk with homeless and hungry and poor. 
 And your hands are the hands I am lifting, 
 Your voice is the life I am living; 
 Your love longs to meet them, but how will they know, 
 Unless I am willing to go? 
 Lord, where are you hungry and where are you thirsty, 
 Naked, imprisoned, with no one to care? 
 To give of our best to the poor and oppressed 
 Is to give back to You. 
 So cause us to see with the eyes of the Saviour, 
 Give us a heart that will love as you love; 
 Courageous compassion in words and in action 
 Brings hope to the world. 
 For you live in the streets of the city, 
 You stand with the weak and the needy, 
 You walk with homeless and hungry and poor. 
 And your hands are the hands I am lifting, 
 Your voice is the life I am living; 
 Your love longs to meet them, but how will they know, 
 Unless I am willing to go? 
 That you live in the streets of the city, 
 You stand with the weak and the needy 
 You walk with homeless and hungry and poor. 
 And your hands are the hands I am lifting, 
 Your voice is the life I am living, 
 Without us there’s no other way they will know, 
 So send me, I’m ready to go.

The King of Love is my delight 
 His eyes are fire, His face is light 
 The First and Last, the Living One 
 His name is Jesus 
 And from His mouth there comes a sound 
 That shakes the earth and splits the ground 
 And yet this voice is life to me 
 The voice of Jesus 
 And I will sing my songs of love 
 Calling out across the earth 
 The King has come 
 The King of love has come 
 And troubled minds can know His peace 
 Captive hearts can be released 
 The King has come 
 The King of love has come 
 My Lover's breath is sweetest wine 
 I am His prize, and He is mine 
 How can a sinner know such joy? 
 Because of Jesus 
 The wounds of love are in His hands 
 The price is paid for sinful man 
 Accepted child, forgiven son 
 Because of Jesus? 
 And my desire is to have You near 
 Lord, You know that You are welcome here 
 Before such love, before such grace 
 I will let the walls come down

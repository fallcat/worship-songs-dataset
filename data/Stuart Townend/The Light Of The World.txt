The Light of the World 
 Made history begin, 
 Spoke time into being, 
 Caused planets to spin; 
 Flung galaxies wide 
 Through infinite space 
 To sing of His splendour 
 And fathomless grace. 
 Come, come, 
 Daughters and sons, 
 Look to the Light of the World. 
 Sing, sing 
 Praises to Him. 
 Simply believe, 
 You will receive 
 Mercy and love without measure. 
 The Light of the World 
 Now shone as a man, 
 And walked through the valleys 
 He'd carved with His hands. 
 A servant to those 
 He'd breathed into life, 
 He felt our injustice 
 And shared in our strife. 
 The Light of the World 
 Preached justice for all, 
 Defying the proud 
 And defending the poor; 
 Then humbled Himself 
 To death on a cross, 
 To crush the oppressor 
 And rescue the lost. 
 The Light of the World 
 Still shines on the earth, 
 With gifts of forgiveness, 
 The hope of new birth. 
 So open your heart, 
 Don't hide in the night; 
 Step out of the darkness 
 And into His light.

Our Father God in heaven above 
 Your holy name be honoured 
 Your kingdom come, your will be done 
 On earth as in heaven 
 Give us this day our daily bread 
 Forgive us our transgressions 
 As freely we forgive the debts 
 Of those who sin against us 
 Yours is the kingdom 
 Forever more, amen 
 The power and the glory 
 Forever more, amen 
 Forever more, amen 
 And keep us from temptation’s hour 
 Deliver us from evil 
 The strength to stand when Satan’s power 
 Would rise against your people 
 And Jesus, teach us how to pray 
 To plead the cause of heaven 
 With humble hearts that learn to stay 
 Forgiving and forgiven

See the stricken boat 
 As it is tossed upon the sea 
 Hear the fearful cries 
 That wake the man from Galilee 
 He stands before the raging 
 Speaks peace and harmony 
 Winds and waves obey 
 He is the man who calmed the sea 
 Hear among the crowds 
 A desperate father's anguished plea: 
 "Heal my dying child" 
 He begs the man from Galilee 
 With words that banish sorrow 
 "Don't fear, but just believe 
 Daughter, live again!" 
 Commands the man who calmed the sea 
 And as she stands before them 
 What joy from agony! 
 He's the Master and the Maker 
 He's the man who calmed the sea 
 Feel the bitter pall 
 That shrouds the hill of Calvary 
 High upon the cross 
 There hangs the man from Galilee 
 The earth it quakes with sorrow 
 The sky grows dark with grief 
 All creation mourns 
 To lose the man who calmed the sea 
 But, no, death could not hold Him 
 The stone is rolled away 
 For He's the Master and the Maker 
 He's the man who calmed the sea 
 Now I hear the call 
 That echoes down through history 
 "Come, deny yourself 
 Take up your cross and follow Me. 
 Through every joy and sorrow 
 My grace is all you'll need. 
 Trust me in the storm 
 For I'm the man who calms the sea" 
 No fear shall overwhelm me 
 For Lord, I do believe 
 You're the Master and the Maker 
 You're the man who calms the sea 
 I'll trust You for tomorrow 
 And seek You for today 
 For You're the Master and the Maker 
 You're the man who calms the sea

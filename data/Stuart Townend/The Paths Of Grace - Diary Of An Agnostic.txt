Well, I can't understand 
 How a rational man 
 Could admit to this 
 But somewhere inside 
 There's a visceral cry 
 For something more than this 
 So is it a stone or a beating heart? 
 Is it oil on canvas or work of art? 
 A hunger for meaning that's more 
 Than a trick of the mind? 
 Or am I a note in a beautiful song 
 With a great Orchestrator who says 
 I belong? 
 At the side of the road 
 Where the lavender grows 
 There's a hint of you 
 In the smile of surprise 
 In the look of the eyes 
 Just a glimpse of you 
 A mystery pulses beneath the skin 
 With places and times where the layers are thin 
 Oh, give me the courage to dig through 
 The mud and the mire 
 To find what's been calling me all along 
 A Love that embraces and says 
 I belong 
 So I called to the sky 
 And the whispered reply 
 Sounded next to me 
 He was here all along 
 Through the rain and the sun 
 Watching over me 
 And I’m learning to walk in the paths of grace 
 It’s not where you are, it’s the way you face 
 The past is behind, and the future 
 Is safe in His hands 
 There’s joy in this knowing and being known 
 And I may be a pilgrim who’s far from home 
 But I know where I’m going and where 
 I belong

There is a home that wanderers seek 
 There is a strength that lifts the weak 
 There is hope for those that know despair 
 There is a cup that satisfies 
 There is a Friend who dries my eyes 
 There is peace for those with heavy hearts 
 Tender mercy 
 The tender mercy of our God 
 From lips of sinners 
 He has heard the faintest cry 
 Tender mercy 
 The tender mercy of our God 
 He has relented and His grace is my delight 
 I have resolved to know Him more 
 He whom the hosts of heaven adore 
 Mighty King, whose reign will never end 
 Yet as I gaze at the Holy One 
 He beckons me to closer come 
 Bares the scars that show to me my worth

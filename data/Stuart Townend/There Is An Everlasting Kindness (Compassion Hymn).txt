There is an everlasting kindness 
 You lavished on us 
 When the Radiance of heaven 
 Came to rescue the lost 
 You called the sheep without a shepherd 
 To leave their distress 
 For your streams of forgiveness 
 And the shade of Your rest 
 And with compassion for the hurting 
 You reached out Your hand 
 As the lame ran to meet You 
 And the dead breathed again 
 You saw behind the eyes of sorrow 
 And shared in our tears 
 Heard the sigh of the weary 
 Let the children draw near 
 What boundless love 
 What fathomless grace 
 You have shown us 
 O God of compassion 
 Each day we live 
 An offering of praise 
 As we show to the world Your compassion 
 We stood beneath the cross of Calvary 
 And gazed on Your face 
 At the thorns of oppression 
 And the wounds of disgrace 
 For surely You have borne our suffering 
 And carried our grief 
 As You pardoned the scoffer 
 And showed grace to the thief 
 How beautiful the feet that carry 
 This gospel of peace 
 To the fields of injustice 
 And the valleys of need 
 To be a voice of hope and healing 
 To answer the cries 
 Of the hungry and helpless 
 With the mercy of Christ

When darkness surrounds me 
 When every hope and dream 
 Lies broken in my hands 
 Your kindness reminds me 
 That there is one who understands 
 One who walked this lonely road before 
 One who gives me strength to say 
 Every hour in my deepest need 
 There is grace for me, there is grace for me 
 By Your power whenever I am weak 
 There is grace for me, there is grace enough for me 
 Stand by me, revive me 
 When I am weary with the sorrow and the loss 
 Release me, and teach me 
 To bring my burdens to the cross 
 Blood that cleanses every trace of sin 
 Love that mends the broken heart 
 Grace when the battle is long 
 Grace when temptation is strong 
 Grace when my courage is gone 
 And doubts confound me 
 Grace for the faith to believe 
 Grace for the heart to receive 
 Grace for the power to leave 
 The past behind me 
 Christ before me 
 All my hope in You

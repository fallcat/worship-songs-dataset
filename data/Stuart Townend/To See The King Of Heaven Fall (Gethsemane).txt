To see the King of heaven fall 
 In anguish to His knees, 
 The Light and Hope of all the world 
 Now overwhelmed with grief. 
 What nameless horrors must He see, 
 To cry out in the garden: 
 "Oh, take this cup away from me - 
 Yet not my will but Yours, 
 Yet not my will but Yours." 
 To know each friend will fall away, 
 And heaven's voice be still, 
 For hell to have its vengeful day 
 Upon Golgotha's hill. 
 No words describe the Savior's plight - 
 To be by God forsaken 
 Till wrath and love are satisfied 
 And every sin is paid 
 And every sin is paid 
 What took Him to this wretched place, 
 What kept Him on this road? 
 His love for Adam's curs√©d race, 
 For every broken soul. 
 No sin too slight to overlook, 
 No crime too great to carry, 
 All mingled in this poisoned cup - 
 And yet He drank it all, 
 The Savior drank it all, 
 The Savior drank it all.

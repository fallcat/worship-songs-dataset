Come, all you vagabonds 
 Come all you 'don't belongs' 
 Winners and losers 
 Come, people like me 
 Come all you travellers 
 Tired from the journey 
 Come wait a while, stay a while 
 Welcomed you'll be 
 Come all you questioners 
 Looking for answers 
 And searching for reasons 
 And sense in it all 
 Come all you fallen 
 And come all you broken 
 Find strength for your body 
 And food for your soul 
 Come to the feast 
 There is room at the table 
 Come let us meet in this place 
 With the King of all kindness 
 Who welcomes us in 
 With the wonder of love 
 And the power of grace 
 The wonder of the love 
 And the power of grace 
 Come those who worry 
 'Bout houses and money 
 And all those who don't have 
 A care in the world 
 From every station 
 And orientation 
 The helpless, the hopeless 
 The young and the old 
 Come all believers 
 And dreamers and schemers 
 And come all you restless 
 Just searching for home 
 Movers and shakers 
 And givers and takers 
 The happy, the sad 
 And the lost and alone 
 Come self-sufficient 
 With wearied ambition 
 And come those who feel 
 At the end of the road 
 Fiery debaters 
 And religion haters 
 Accusers, abusers 
 The hurt and ignored

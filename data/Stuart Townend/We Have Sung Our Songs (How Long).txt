We have sung our songs of victory 
 We have prayed to You for rain 
 We have cried for Your compassion 
 To renew the land again 
 Now we're standing in Your presence 
 More hungry than before 
 Now we're on Your steps of mercy 
 And we're knocking at Your door 
 How long before You drench the barren land 
 How long before we see Your righteous hand 
 How long before Your name is lifted high 
 How long before the weeping turns to songs of joy 
 Lord, we know Your heart is broken 
 By the evil that You see 
 And You've stayed Your hand of judgement 
 For You plan to set men free 
 But the land is still in darkness 
 And we've fled from what is right 
 We have failed the silent children 
 Who will never see the light 
 How long before You drench the barren land 
 How long before we see Your righteous hand 
 How long before Your name is lifted high 
 How long before the weeping turns to songs of joy 
 But I know a day is coming 
 When the deaf will hear His voice 
 When the blind will see their Saviour 
 And the lame will leap for joy 
 When the widow finds a Husband 
 Who will always love His bride 
 And the orphan finds a Father 
 Who will never leave her side 
 How long before Your glory lights the skies 
 How long before Your radiance lifts our eyes 
 How long before Your fragrance fills the air 
 How long before the earth resounds with songs of joy

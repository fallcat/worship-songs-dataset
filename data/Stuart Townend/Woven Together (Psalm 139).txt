Woven together within the womb 
 Fearfully, wonderfully made 
 You know me better than I know myself 
 And still You look on with pleasure 
 Where can I go from Your Spirit, Lord 
 Where can I hide from Your gaze 
 Ocean to ocean and shore to shore 
 Your hand reaches out to guide me 
 It's all too wonderful 
 For me to know 
 It's all too marvellous 
 For me to attain 
 The care You show to those 
 Who love Your name 
 It's all too wonderful 
 It's all too wonderful for me 
 Lord, You have searched me, You know me well 
 For nothing is hidden from You 
 And even before there's a word on my tongue 
 You know it completely, Lord 
 How precious to me are Your thoughts, O God 
 How great is the depth of Your love 
 I know that You've numbered the sum of my days 
 I'll rest in Your perfect wisdom

You are my anchor, 
 My light and my salvation. 
 You are my refuge, 
 My heart will not fear. 
 Though my foes surround me on every hand, 
 They will stumble and fall 
 While in grace I stand. 
 In my day of trouble 
 You hide me and set me above 
 To sing this song of love. 
 One thing I will ask of You, this will I pray: 
 To dwell in Your house, O Lord, every day, 
 To gaze upon Your lovely face, 
 And rest in the Father's embrace. 
 Teach me Your way, Lord, 
 Make straight the path before me. 
 Do not forsake me, my hope is in You. 
 As I walk through life, I am confident 
 I will see Your goodness with every step, 
 And my heart directs me to seek You 
 In all that I do, 
 So I will wait for You.

You’ve placed a hunger in my heart to see your glory, 
 You’ve caused a thirst that I cannot ignore; 
 You’ve stirred a passion that will drive me to Your presence, 
 And I won’t rest until You’ve heard me cry for more. 
 Come as a might torrent, come as a raging fire, 
 Come as a hurricane that drives the heat of my desire. 
 Come in the smallest whisper, come as the quiet dew, 
 We don’t care how You come, 
 As long as You come to us. 
 Though people mock the church and curse 
 The One who made them, 
 Your kingdom is advancing every day; 
 Like living stones we’re being built into a temple, 
 We’ve seen the glory and we cannot turn away. 
 Is this the summer that will see a mighty harvest? 
 A sense of expectation fills the air; 
 Though sin abounds, Your love is streaming to the nations, 
 Let mercy triumph over judgement everywhere. 
 Come to the politician, come to the refugee, 
 Come to the victim of respectable society; 
 Come to the mighty fallen, come to the poor oppressed; 
 We don’t care how You come, 
 As long as You come to them.

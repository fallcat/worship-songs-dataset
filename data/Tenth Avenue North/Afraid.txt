I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna to be afraid anymore 
 When the world shakes 
 Feel my heart race 
 When the voices start again 
 Oh, the panics creeping in 
 Who will I listen to 
 Fear never told the truth 
 So I'll wait on You tonight 
 Worries only wasted time 
 I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 Not like before, oh 
 I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 I'm safe in Your love, oh, Lord 
 In the future 
 You will return 
 We'll watch the darkness break 
 And finally see Your face soon 
 Forever be alive 
 With Your Kingdom, death will die 
 So I'll wait on You tonight 
 Worries only wasted time 
 I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 Not like before, oh 
 I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 I'm safe in Your love, oh, Lord 
 This world cannot take my treasure 
 This world doesn't own my tears 
 My hope is alive in heaven 
 I will not give into despair 
 I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 I don't have to be afraid 
 I don't have to be afraid anymore 
 Oh, Lord 
 I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 Not like before, oh 
 I don't wanna be afraid 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 I'm safe in Your love, oh, Lord 
 Don't wanna be afraid 
 (Don't want, don't want) 
 Don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 (Don't want, don't want) 
 (Don't want, don't want) 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 Don't wanna be afraid 
 (Don't want, don't want) 
 I don't wanna be afraid anymore 
 (Don't want, don't want) 
 (Don't want, don't want) 
 I don't have to be afraid anymore

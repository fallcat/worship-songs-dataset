Find myself on this rock place again 
 Trying to climb hoping to find you there 
 At the end of my fate and my fear 
 Fears of falling away 
 As I'm calling your name into the air 
 As I climb higher my body's on fire 
 And weak I need escape from the tourturous heat 
 I feel my hand slipping 
 The loose stones come slipping away 
 Telling me that I can't stay 
 It all falls empty 
 Everything I do 
 Yes it all falls empty 
 I'm reaching out to you 
 I'm reaching out to you 
 I find my self on my face again 
 Trying to climb hoping to find you there 
 At the end of my fate and my fear 
 Fears of falling away 
 As I'm calling your name into the air 
 This time I'm trying to find hoping to find you there 
 Well I'm desperate and tired 
 Of walking this wire so weak 
 Its one thing from him that's out to break 
 Well it does and I fee fall 
 Can't stop this at all 
 I tumble and fall into your hands 
 It all falls empty 
 Everything I do 
 Yes it all falls empty 
 I'm reaching out to you 
 I'm reaching out to you 
 ... To you 
 Cause its easier said then done 
 To completly loose control 
 And its easier said then done 
 To let you pry my fingers from these arms 
 It all falls empty 
 Everything I do 
 Yes it all falls empty 
 I'm reaching out for you 
 I'm reaching out for you 
 I'm reaching out crying out for you 
 I'm reaching out for you

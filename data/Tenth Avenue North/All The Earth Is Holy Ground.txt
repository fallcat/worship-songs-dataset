All the earth is holy ground 
 All the earth is holy ground 
 Every single breath 
 Every single sound 
 I can feel you with me now 
 Ooh, ooh 
 All the earth is holy ground 
 All the earth is holy ground 
 I don't believe in secular things 
 Just a world waiting to be redeemed 
 I was lost but I was found 
 And all the earth is holy ground 
 Ooh, ooh 
 All the earth is holy ground 
 Wherever I go, I see light 
 I see your light 
 Wherever I go, the sacred's inside 
 Of the sacred inside 
 Oh what a mystery 
 Your life and breath alive inside of me 
 Unworthy to be your son 
 But somehow you reached down and made me your own 
 Your mercy has remade 
 This house I burned down to the grave 
 Your spirit filled my lungs 
 Now wherever I go, I bring the kingdom come 
 Let my song resound 
 All the earth is holy ground 
 All the earth is holy ground 
 Ooh, ooh 
 All the earth is holy ground 
 Wherever I go, I see light 
 I see your light 
 Wherever I go, there's sacred inside

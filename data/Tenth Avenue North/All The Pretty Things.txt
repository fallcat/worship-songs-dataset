We are, we are, we're caught in the in-between 
 Of who we already are and who we're yet to be 
 We're looking for love but finding we're still in need 
 It's only what we have lost will we be allowed to keep 
 And we're waiting but our eyes are wandering 
 To all this earth holds dear 
 Look at all the pretty things 
 That steal my heart away 
 I can feel I'm fading 
 ‘Cause Lord I love so many things 
 That keep me from Your face 
 Come and save me 
 We run, we run to finally be set free 
 But we're fighting for what we already have received 
 So we're waiting but our eyes are wandering 
 To all this earth holds dear 
 Look at all the pretty things 
 That steal my heart away 
 I can feel I'm fading 
 ‘Cause Lord I love so many things 
 That keep me from Your face 
 Come and save me 
 We are, we are, we're caught in the in-between 
 But we're fighting for what we already have received 
 We are, we are, we're caught in the in-between 
 But we're fighting for what we already have received 
 Look at all the pretty things 
 That steal my heart away 
 I can feel I'm fading 
 ‘Cause Lord I love so many things 
 That keep me from Your face 
 Come and save me

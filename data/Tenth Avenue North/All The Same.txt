A thousand voices 
 A thousand lives 
 A thousand prayers rise in the night 
 What is it we seek? 
 So many stories 
 Lord, I hear 
 And all these questions in my ear 
 Can we come out clean? 
 Different faces 
 Different fears 
 Different failures lead us here 
 Show us how 
 We're all the same 
 Desperate for a change 
 We're all the same 
 We need your love 
 We need your love 
 We take our secrets 
 To the grave 
 Spend our lives out in the shame 
 Afraid to show our needs 
 But as we run our hands 
 Along these scars 
 May they tell us who we are 
 We are the redeemed 
 Different faces 
 Different fears 
 Different failures lead us here 
 Show us how 
 We're all the same 
 All desperate for a change 
 We're all the same 
 We need your love 
 We're all the same 
 With hands held out for grace 
 We're all the same 
 We need your love 
 We need your love 
 We need your love 
 So if we're casting stones 
 If we've forgotten what we know 
 That we don't walk alone in this life 
 Let your love 
 Get inside our bones 
 Lay it deep within us, grow 
 May we bring in the ones left outside 
 'Cause we're all the same 
 All desperate for a change 
 We're all the same 
 We need your love 
 We're all the same 
 With hands held out for grace 
 We're all the same 
 We need your love 
 We need your love 
 I need your love

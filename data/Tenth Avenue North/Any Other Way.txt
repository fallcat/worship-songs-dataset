Don't say goodbye, don't say hello 
 We're just standing on the surface 
 Don't say alright, don't say I know 
 I promise it's not worth it 
 I want to know who you are 
 Even if you're falling apart 
 Reach in and touch your scars 
 And all the shame you've kept in your heart 
 ‘Cause it's not enough 
 It's not enough just to say that we're ok 
 I need your hurt, I need your pain 
 It's not love any other way 
 So let's not pretend, stop your parade 
 Trying to convince me 
 That you're alright and everything's ok 
 Do you even know me? 
 ‘Cause I already know who you are 
 And all the things that kept us apart 
 So reach in and touch my scars 
 And know the price I paid for your heart 
 That it's not enough 
 It's not enough just to say that we're ok 
 I need your hurt, I need your pain 
 It's not love any other way 
 A broken and contrite heart I will not despise 
 Come as you are and I won't close my eyes 
 I won't close my eyes 
 I won't close my eyes 
 I won't close my eyes 
 ‘Cause it's not enough 
 It's not enough just to say that we're ok 
 I need your hurt, I need your pain 
 It's not love any other way 
 'Cause it's not enough 
 It's not enough just to say that you're ok 
 Well, you needed my hurt 
 You needed my pain 
 It's not love any other way 
 It's not love any other way

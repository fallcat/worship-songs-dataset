9 in the morning Saturday came. 
 Mom's in the kitchen fixing the *same,* and dad got up early to work hard outside. 
 Today was the day he would teach me to ride 
 I rush to the kitchen to eat up the meal. 
 Dad waltzes in with a smile that was real. 
 He knew I was watching, he knew I was there, 
 Ready to chase all the birds in the air 
 Traveling faster and racing the wind, 
 All is alive and the sky has a grin 
 While it welcomes me right here. 
 I have no limits and no need to cry. 
 I'm free like an eagle high in the sky. 
 What could stop these wings when they fly? 
 Dad takes my hand we walk out the door. 
 He's ready to show me just how to soar. 
 He took off the trainers and placed me ontop. 
 Held on the back as he gave me the talk. 
 I kept on moving and once he let go 
 I did as he told me, which is all I know. 
 I went through the tunnel straight to the beach 
 Peddling down the sandy concrete. 
 Traveling faster and racing the wind, 
 All is alive and the sky has a grin 
 While it welcomes me right here. 
 I have no limits and no need to cry. 
 I'm free like an eagle high in the sky. 
 What could stop these wings when they fly? 
 I pay no attention to the road all around. 
 A rock stops the wheel as I plunge to the ground. 
 I can't move a muscle and the ride is deformed. 
 I'm more then just helpless in these clothes that are torn. 
 But off in the distance a man starts to run 
 It was my daddy saving his son 
 And the more that I cried 
 The more he embraced 
 So I rode onto his shoulders and flying back home 
 We raced... 
 Traveling faster and racing the wind, 
 All is alive and the sky has a grin 
 While it welcomes me right here. 
 I have no limits and no need to cry. 
 I'm free like an eagle high in the sky. 
 When they fly 
 When they fly

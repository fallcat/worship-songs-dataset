Well, you know how much I hate this conversation 
 Why can't you put it on the shelf? 
 Gathering words the way I'm gathering all of your excuses 
 Throw 'em all away 
 Well, I can see the direction this is going to 
 So, I can say I've been here before 
 And it's no fun because I know the only resolution 
 Is not in your favor 
 Please, just don't let me go 
 I've tried to say what I know 
 Give me all the answers you've heard 
 They must have sounded so absurd 
 Frustrated with the attitude you're putting out 
 Please stop sounding thirteen again 
 Pull the handle for your nights', I might, big bright lights that 
 Hang around your neck and say, 
 "Here are my questions, so, where are the answers?" 
 Then you say what I have to say and then I'll let you go 
 I didn't mean to waste all your time 
 Just remember that I'm trying hard to give you some light 
 Well, I hope you can take it 
 You just don't understand 
 It's hard to know who I am 
 Thanks for your time, and anyway 
 Let's try again some other day 
 Frustrated with the attitude you're putting out 
 Please stop sounding thirteen again 
 Pull the handle for your nights', I might, big bright lights that 
 Hang around your neck and say, 
 "Here are my questions, so, where are the answers?" 
 I've done my best to inform 
 But now your hard head is worn 
 You never listened from the start 
 While I was pouring out my heart 
 Frustrated with the attitude you're putting out 
 Please stop sounding thirteen again 
 You remind me of myself when I was in seventh grade 
 I wore a sign around my neck that said, 
 "Here are my questions, so, where are the answers?" 
 "Here are my questions, so, where are the answers?" 
 "Here are my questions, so, where are the answers?"

Love of my life 
 Look deep in my eyes 
 There you will find what you need 
 And give me your life 
 The lust and the lies 
 And the past you're afraid I might see 
 You've been running away from me, yeah 
 You're my beloved lover 
 I'm yours 
 And Death shall not part us 
 It's you I died for 
 For better or worse 
 Forever we'll be 
 My love it unites us and it binds you to me 
 It's a mystery 
 Love of my life 
 Look deep in my eyes 
 There you will find what you need 
 I'm the giver of life 
 I'll clothe you in white 
 My immaculate bride you will be 
 Oh, come running home to me, yeah 
 You're my beloved lover 
 I'm yours 
 And Death shall not part us 
 It's you I died for 
 For better or worse 
 Forever we'll be 
 My love it unites us and it binds you to me, yeah 
 You've been a mistress, my wife 
 Chasing lovers that won't satisfy 
 Won't you let me make you my bride 
 You will drink of my lips and you'll taste new life 
 You're my beloved lover 
 I'm yours 
 And Death shall not part us 
 It's you I died for 
 For better or worse 
 Forever we'll be 
 My love it unites us and it binds you to me 
 It's a mystery

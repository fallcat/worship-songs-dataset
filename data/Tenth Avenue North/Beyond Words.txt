Well if you only knew the pain that I've been threw 
 Since when did it become all about you 
 As you can see from the start I've said the truth 
 And if the truth means nothing to you 
 Then what am I supposed to do? 
 And ill still love you 
 Beyond what words can say 
 Ill take your every suffering moment 
 And bring a better day 
 Ill still love you 
 More then what I hope to be 
 Let me wrap my arms around you 
 Let me take your breath away 
 And every time I ask 
 You assure your doing fine 
 But your heart looks good by smiling 
 You couldn't fool mine 
 And by the end of the night your pilliow sits to dry 
 In a crowded room your singing 
 But on the inside you sigh 
 And ill still love you 
 Beyond what words can say 
 Ill take your every suffering moment 
 And bring a better day 
 Ill still love you 
 More then what I hope to be 
 Let me wrap my arms around you 
 Let me take your breath away 
 In a ball room there is dancing 
 In a forest there are trees 
 In a child there's a hope 
 That keeps him in belief 
 With any star there is a sky 
 With any beach there's a sea 
 With any love song there's a lover 
 And in your heart I hope its... 
 And ill still love you 
 Beyond what words can say 
 Ill take your every suffering moment 
 And bring a better day 
 And ill still love you 
 More then what I hope to be 
 Let me wrap my arms around you 
 Let me wrap my arms around you 
 Let me wrap my arms around you 
 Let me take your breath away

Yeah I feel You falling 
 Like the rain against my skin 
 And I hear You calling 
 Your voice like thunder in my head 
 But now I am stalling 
 'Cause I'm afraid to let You in 
 Come break me down with Your mercy 
 Come break me down again 
 I'm Yours tonight 
 I'm Yours if You can break me down 
 Break through these walls I hide behind 
 I'm Yours tonight 
 Come and break me down 
 Won't You break me 
 Won't You break me down 
 I feel it inside me 
 I feel You underneath my skin 
 These walls could not hide me 
 They could not keep you from coming in 
 So now here You find me 
 Right back to where I began 
 Come break me down with Your mercy 
 Come break me down again 
 I'm Yours tonight 
 I'm Yours if You can break me down 
 Break through these walls I hide behind 
 I'm Yours tonight 
 Come and break me down 
 Won't You break me down 
 Break me down, oh 
 Come and break me down 
 'Cause I need Your strength to feel this weak 
 I need Your touch to feel my need 
 I need Your strong hands to carry me 
 Take me break me set me free 
 'Cause I need Your strength to feel this weak 
 I need Your touch to feel my need 
 And I need Your strong hands to carry me 
 Take me bring me to my knees 
 I'm Yours tonight 
 I'm Yours if you can break me down 
 Break through these walls I hide behind 
 I'm Yours tonight 
 Come and break me down 
 Come and break me down 
 Come and break me down, yeah 
 Won't You break me down

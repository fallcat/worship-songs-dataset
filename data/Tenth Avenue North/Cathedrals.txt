We were built by the hands of love 
 Redeemed in spite of what we've done 
 We are the spirit's dwelling place 
 And now, children of the light 
 Fight back darkness with delight 
 Lift your eyes up to his face 
 Let joy take temptation's place 
 Joy takes temptation's place 
 Open up our souls 
 To feel your glory 
 Lord, we are a desperate people 
 Your cathedrals 
 God, fill this space 
 Let joy take temptation's place 
 We will taste and see you as you are 
 Father, let your kingdom come 
 Keep us from our lesser loves 
 Nothing else can satisfy 
 Like a joy found in your eyes 
 There's joy found inside your eyes 
 Your eyes 
 Open up our souls 
 To feel your glory 
 Lord, we are a desperate people 
 Your cathedrals 
 Come fill this space 
 Let joy take temptation's place 
 We will taste and see you as you are 
 May we see you as you are 
 And our hungry souls reach out 
 To whatever fills us up 
 But we'll keep on falling down 
 Unless we fall in love 
 Yeah our hungry souls reach out 
 To whatever fills us up 
 But we keep on falling down 
 Until we fall in love 
 Open up our souls 
 To feel your glory 
 Lord, we are a desperate people 
 Your cathedrals 
 Come fill this space 
 Let joy take temptation's place 
 We will taste and see you as you are 
 Lord, lord, lord

Feel the breathing in your lungs 
 Lift your face, warm against the sun 
 Be not blinded by what you see 
 Cause in this moment, we touch eternity 
 We are coming aware 
 We are coming aware 
 You are closer, closer 
 You are closer, closer, come on 
 Closer than my fear 
 You are closer, closer 
 You are closer, closer, come on 
 Let me know you're near 
 And push away my fear 
 Push away my fear, yeah 
 Where can I go 
 Where can I hide 
 You know my every thought 
 And everything inside 
 You're attracted to the weak 
 My pride's the only thing that keeps you from me 
 We are coming aware 
 We are coming aware 
 You are closer, closer 
 You are closer, closer, come on 
 Closer than my fear 
 You are closer, closer 
 You are closer, closer, come on 
 Let me know you're near 
 And push away my fear 
 Well I'm embarrassed to admit 
 The distance I've been feeling 
 Has all been self imposed, yeah 
 So now it's time to quit 
 And let your nearness in 
 No fear will go unopposed 
 I can feel you in the air 
 Closer, closer 
 You are closer, closer, come on 
 Closer than my fear 
 Closer, closer 
 You are closer, closer, come on 
 Let me know you're near 
 And push away my fear 
 Push away my fear 
 Push away my fear

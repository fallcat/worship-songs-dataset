Walking down the dusty road 
 Though week I thought I was so strong 
 Trying to make it one my own 
 I keep tripping on my clumsy feet 
 Look here at the mess I made of me 
 When you pulled me from the mud and clay 
 Yeah so you fill me anyway 
 But you hold me anyways 
 And I said ... 
 Consume me with your fire 
 Clense me with your rain 
 Bring and purify me let me glorify your name 
 Until only your love remains 
 Consume me with your fire 
 Clense me with your rain 
 Yeah wash away my empty past 
 Until only your love remains 
 Love remains ... till only your love reamins 
 22 years passed me by 
 22 years I sat and cried 
 Living by sight and not by faith 
 Oh lord you won't dispise 
 Forgiving me so many times 
 When I turned and I walked away 
 Yeah but you turned me around 
 When I humbled myself to pray 
 And I say... 
 Consume me with your fire 
 Clense me with your rain 
 Bring and purify me let me glorify your name 
 Until only your love remains 
 Consume me with your fire 
 Clense me with your rain 
 Yeah wash away my empty past 
 Until only your love remains 
 Love remains ... only your love reamins 
 Amazing grace just rain on me today 
 Yeah forgive me as I'm giving my heart 
 To you to you to you 
 Yeah 
 Consume me with your fire 
 Clense me with your rain 
 Bring and purify me let me glorify your name 
 Until only your love remains 
 Consume me with your fire 
 Clense me with your rain 
 Yeah wash away my empty past 
 Until only your love remains 
 Love remains ... only your love reamins

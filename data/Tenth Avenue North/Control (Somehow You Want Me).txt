Here I am 
 All my intentions 
 All my obsessions 
 I want to lay them all down 
 In Your hands 
 Only Your love is vital 
 Though I'm not entitled 
 Still You call me Your child 
 God You don't need me 
 But somehow You want me 
 Oh how You love me 
 Somehow that frees me 
 To take my hands off of my life 
 And the way it should go 
 God You don't need me 
 But somehow You want me 
 Oh how You love me 
 Somehow that frees me 
 To open my hands up 
 And give You control 
 I give You control 
 I've had plans 
 Shattered and broken 
 Things I have hopen in 
 Fall through my hands 
 You have plans 
 To redeem and restore me 
 You're behind and before me 
 Oh help me believe 
 God You don't need me 
 But somehow You want me 
 Oh how You love me 
 Somehow that frees me 
 To take my hands off of my life 
 And the way it should go, oh 
 God You don't need me 
 But somehow You want me 
 Oh how You love me 
 Somehow that frees me 
 To open my hands up 
 And give You control 
 Oh You want me 
 Somehow You want me 
 The King of Heaven wants me 
 So this world has lost it's grip on me 
 Oh You want me 
 Somehow You want me 
 The King of Heaven wants me 
 So this world has lost it's grip on me 
 God You don't need me 
 But somehow You want me 
 Oh how You love me 
 Somehow that frees me 
 To take my hands off of my life 
 And the way it should go, oh 
 God You don't need me 
 But somehow You want me 
 Oh how You love me 
 Somehow that frees me 
 To open my hands up 
 And give You control 
 I give You control 
 Oh, give You control 
 Oh I want to give You control 
 I give You control 
 Oh You want me 
 Somehow You want me 
 The King of Heaven wants me 
 So this world has lost it's grip on me

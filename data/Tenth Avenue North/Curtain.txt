I believe in what will last forever 
 Not in things I see for they depend on time 
 Forever knows that true love needs a lover 
 To discover what all the others lack in time 
 You slip out from the curtain 
 Revealing what is certain 
 It's not wonder why you are 
 My dreams fall to pieces 
 As your love increases 
 It's no wonder why you are 
 You are mine 
 Believe the lies so all the world will show you 
 The disease of faith and the argument of proof 
 To trust the sun will rise again tomorrow 
 Is a faith that we all have that's the truth 
 To know we all need something 
 Something that's much 
 Bigger than ourselves and that's why 
 I believe in what will last forever 
 Not in things I see for they depend on time

Well, it all comes down to this- 
 Nothing else to bother me 
 And no one else around. 
 I'm searching for Your kiss, 
 Running back into Your arms, 
 And facing toward the ground. 
 With the beating of my heart 
 And the tears rolling down -(oh yeah) 
 All I'm looking for now 
 Is the peace and joy that I once knew 
 Because it's You - 
 You are the one 
 And it's You - 
 Giving light to the Sun 
 And it's You - 
 You are always unto - 
 Yeah it's You. 
 Well, I know sometimes it seems 
 I'm losing track of time with you 
 And everything's so clear. 
 Well, like a bird I'm free. 
 Noticing your love for me 
 Never far, but near. 
 So I'm still looking for, 
 Trying hard not to look back. 
 I know I'll never get bored 
 With the love and joy I find in You 
 Because it's You - 
 You are the one 
 And it's You - 
 Giving light to the Sun 
 And it's You - 
 You are always unto - 
 Yeah it's You. 
 I know it's You - 
 You are the one 
 And it's You - 
 Giving light to the Sun 
 And it's You - 
 You are always unto - 
 Yeah it's You. 
 Nothing else compares to You. 
 You are the life You are the truth. 
 Nothing else compares to You. 
 Take me back where I once knew. 
 Nothing else compares to You. 
 You are the life You are the truth. 
 Nothing else compares to You. 
 Take me back where I once knew. 
 Nothing else compares to You. 
 You are the life, You are the truth. 
 Nothing else compares to You. 
 Take me back where I once knew 
 It's a song of love

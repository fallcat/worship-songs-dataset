There's a beggar down inside of me 
 Standing on the corner of your street 
 And my shame is my only company 
 Could use some cash but can't admit my need 
 For what You got and what I could receive 
 I need Your love to come and break the silence 
 Don't stop the madness 
 Don't stop the chaos 
 Don't stop the pain surrounding me 
 Don't be afraid, Lord, to break my heart 
 Just bring me down to my knees 
 But all I hear is what they're selling me 
 That God is love, He isn't suffering 
 And what you need's a little faith in prosperity 
 But oh, my God, I know three's more than this 
 If You promise pain, it can't be meaningless 
 So make me poor if that's the price for freedom 
 Don't stop the madness 
 Don't stop the chaos 
 Don't stop the pain surrounding me 
 Don't be afraid, Lord, to break my heart 
 Just bring me down to my knees 
 In a marriage lost 
 And the cry in the dark 
 Don't stop Your love 
 In a mother's tear 
 For the child who starves 
 Don't stop with our love 
 Wen we're breaking down 
 We're falling apart 
 Don't stop with Your love 
 And with new eyes to see 
 This is our mercy 
 Don't stop with Your love 
 Don't stop the madness 
 Don't stop the chaos 
 Don't stop the pain inside of me 
 Do whatever it takes 
 To give me Your heart 
 And bring me down to my knees, Lord 
 Don't stop 
 Don't stop 
 Just bring me down to my knees, Lord

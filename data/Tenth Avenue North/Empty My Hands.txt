I've got voices in my head and they are so strong 
 And I'm getting sick of this oh Lord, how long 
 Will I be haunted by the fear that I believe 
 My hands like locks on cages 
 Of these dreams I can't set free 
 But if I let these dreams die 
 If I lay down all my wounded pride 
 If I let these dreams die 
 Will I find that letting go lets me come alive 
 So empty my hands 
 Fill up my heart 
 Capture my mind with you 
 These voices speak instead and what's right is wrong 
 And I'm giving into them, please Lord, how long 
 Will I be held captive by the lies that I believe 
 My heart's in constant chaos and it keeps me so deceived 
 But if I let these dreams die 
 If I could just lay down my dark desire 
 If I let these dreams die 
 Will I find you brought me back to life 
 So empty my hands 
 Fill up my heart 
 Capture my mind with you 
 'Cause my mind is like a building burning down 
 I need your grace to keep me, keep me from the ground 
 And my heart is just a prisoner of war 
 A slave to what it wants and to what I'm fighting for 
 So won't you empty my hands 
 Fill up my heart 
 Capture my mind with you 
 Empty my hands 
 Fill up my heart 
 Capture my mind with you 
 With you 
 I need you now

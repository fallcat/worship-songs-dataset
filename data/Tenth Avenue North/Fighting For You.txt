I see the tears on you face 
 I watch your friends walk away 
 Oh, I've been there too 
 I've been there too 
 I see the nights you can't sleep 
 I hear your broken heart beat 
 Oh, I've felt that too 
 Yeah, I've felt that too 
 For you, my body was broken 
 So you are never forsaken 
 Start walking with your head held high 
 The future is bright 
 Heaven's gates are open wide 
 Every trouble that you ever walk through 
 Peace my child, I am 
 I am fighting for you, you 
 I am fighting for you 
 Don't tell me you're a lost cause 
 That maybe you're too far gone 
 Oh, that's not true 
 Yeah, that's not true 
 I give you my last breath 
 So you can breathe again 
 I died for you 
 I died for you 
 For you, my body was broken 
 So you are never forsaken 
 Start walking with your head held high 
 The future is bright 
 Heaven's gates are open wide 
 Every trouble that you ever walk through 
 Peace my child, I am 
 I am fighting for you, you 
 I am fighting for you 
 I'll never stop, I'll never stop 
 I'll never stop 
 Death could never keep me away 
 I'll never stop, I'll never stop 
 I'll never stop calling your name 
 Yeah I'll never stop, it's true 
 Start walking with your head held high 
 The future is bright 
 Heaven's gates are open wide 
 Every trouble that you ever walk through 
 Peace my child, I am 
 I am fighting for you, you 
 I am fighting for you, you 
 I am fighting for you

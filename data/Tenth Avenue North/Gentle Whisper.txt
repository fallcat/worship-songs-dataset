It's so cold and dark 
 And damp on this mountain side 
 In you in you alone 
 I long long to confide 
 Cause even tho I've seen you set ablaze 
 That alter that's soken wet 
 Still I long just to hear you in 
 The voice I havent heard yet 
 Not in the fire lord or in the earthquake 
 My soul shakes for you 
 When I humbly called your name 
 How you softly came 
 Yeah... in a gentle whisper 
 I sit amazed and broken 
 As the breaze comes and cools my face 
 Sweet harmonys of the wind pulls me in 
 And they let me know you're in this place 
 But the breeze soon fades away with the night 
 Leaving me alone in my sin 
 Oh I know I could follow you 
 If I could just hear your voice one more time again 
 Not in the fire lord or in the earthquake 
 My soul shakes for you 
 When I humbly called your name 
 How you softly came 
 Yeah... in a gentle whisper 
 Tear stains on your face 
 Blood stains on your brow 
 Wrestle in their fashion for the sould of man 
 When will they hear you 
 Not in the fire lord or in the earthquake 
 My soul shakes for you 
 When I humbly called your name 
 How you softly came 
 Yeah... in a gentle whisper 
 (Repeat)

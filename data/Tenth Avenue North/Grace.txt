Oh, can you hear 
 Hear mercy sing 
 She cries to bitter hearts 
 And your suffering 
 Oh, please let go 
 Give up your fight 
 Holding back your love 
 Will never make things right, no 
 It's gonna be okay 
 Okay, tonight 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can roll your dead heart's stone away 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can move us to a rhythm that will change our ways 
 Oh, listen to love 
 Let pride hit the ground 
 When joy is the armor 
 It can't be broken down 
 If hate is the fuel 
 No one will win 
 When we love till we're empty 
 That's where life begins 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can roll your dead heart's stone away 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can move us to a rhythm that will change our ways 
 Grace, grace 
 Come and move me 
 Oh come and move me now 
 Grace, grace 
 Only you can lift up what holds me down 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can roll your dead heart's stone away 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can move us to a rhythm that will change our ways 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can roll your dead heart's stone away 
 Grace, only grace 
 Can move us to a rhythm that will change our ways

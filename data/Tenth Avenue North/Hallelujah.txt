At first I am afraid 
 But not because of fear 
 But the holy of holies is drawing me near 
 Your voice like thunder 
 Shakes the ground I'm on 
 So hide my face in the shadow of Your wings, oh Lord 
 Hide my sin from the beauty here before Your throne, Your throne 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 And so we enter in to see Your face, yeah 
 We enter in to see Your face, oh God, mmmm... 
 Well I'm falling to my knees 
 I feel the earth beneath 
 With the weight of my sin and this crushing unbelief 
 Could You really love me 
 With all that I've done, oh Lord 
 So hide my face in the shadow of Your wings, oh Lord 
 Hide my sin from the beauty here before Your throne 
 So hide my face in the shadow of Your wings, oh Lord 
 Hide my sin from the beauty here before Your throne 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 And so we enter in to see Your face, yeah 
 We enter in to see Your face, oh God, oh God 
 We sing Lord 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 And so we enter in to see Your face, yeah 
 We enter in to see Your face, oh God 
 You spread Your hands 
 And made a refuge for the weak 
 And blessed the weary bruised and broken 
 Took us in 
 Inside Your wounds we hide away 
 Inside Your wounds we hide 
 You spread Your hands 
 And made a refuge for the weak 
 And blessed the weary bruised and broken 
 Took us in 
 Inside Your wounds we hide away 
 Inside Your wounds we hide 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 And so we enter in to see Your face, yeah 
 We enter in to see Your face, oh God 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain 
 And so we enter in to see Your face, yeah 
 We enter in to see Your face, oh God

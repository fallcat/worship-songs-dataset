So you thought you had to keep this up 
 All the work that you do so we think that you're good 
 And you can't believe it’s not enough 
 All the walls you built up are just glass on the outside 
 So let them fall down 
 There’s freedom waiting in the sound 
 When you let your walls fall to the ground 
 We’re here now 
 This is where the healing begins 
 This is where the healing starts 
 When you come to where you're broken within 
 The light meets the dark 
 The light meets the dark 
 Afraid to let your secrets out 
 Everything that you hide could come crashing through the door now 
 But too scared to face all your fear 
 So you hide but you find that the shame won't disappear 
 So let them fall down 
 There’s freedom waiting in the sound 
 When you let your walls fall to the ground 
 We’re here now 
 We’re here now 
 This is where the healing begins 
 This is where the healing starts 
 When you come to where you're broken within 
 The light meets the dark 
 The light meets the dark 
 Sparks will fly as grace collides 
 With the dark inside of us 
 So please don't fight this coming light 
 Let this blood come cover us 
 His blood can cover us 
 This is where the healing begins 
 This is where the healing starts 
 When you come to where you're broken within 
 The light meets the dark 
 The light meets the dark

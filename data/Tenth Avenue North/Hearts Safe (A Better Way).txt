I feel it in your eyes 
 There's pain that covers up these lies 
 Now you may look like me 
 But it seems you're really different on the inside 
 We used to keep our hearts safe 
 We kept them safe and locked away 
 But then we grew up learning 
 That life could serve us in a better way 
 And why? 
 I'm asking you why? 
 So what happened to your eyes 
 I saw them wander just like mine 
 So how did we come to see so differently 
 After all this time 
 And why? 
 I'm asking why? 
 And why? 
 I'm asking you why? 
 Well if the sheep know his voice then tell me what is the choice 
 For the ones who haven't heard and have no need to rejoice 
 Father, help me understand 
 â€˜Cause I am just like him and Lord he's just like me 
 We came from the same town and the same families 
 But now he, he just won't understand 
 Please Lord, open up his eyes 
 Can you open these eyes? 
 And why? 
 I'm asking you why?

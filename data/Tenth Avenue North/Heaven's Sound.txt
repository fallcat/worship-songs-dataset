From our darkest alleys 
 To our stained glass walls 
 However high we climb 
 No matter how many times we fall 
 From our greatest trials 
 To our deepest defeats 
 There is a song forever being sung by the redeemed 
 We can lift our voices 
 The strong, the weak, come on 
 We will cry, fill the sky with a melody 
 Till our courage shakes the ground 
 We are known, we are love for all eternity 
 Let this breath join heaven's sound 
 In our secret addictions 
 Let mercy flood in 
 And out of forgiveness 
 The power to break the chains begins 
 And out of the ashes 
 Beauty of love and life returns 
 So let us lift our voices 
 The strong, the weak come on 
 We will cry through the sky with a melody 
 Till our courage shakes the ground 
 We are now, we are love for all eternity 
 Let this breath join heaven's sound 
 Heaven sounds like we're finally breathing 
 Heaven sounds like the guilty made clean 
 Heaven sounds like the rolling of thunder 
 Heaven sounds like prisoners free 
 Heaven's sounds, heaven's sounds 
 We will cry through the sky with a melody 
 Till our courage shakes the ground 
 We are now, we are love for all eternity 
 Let this breath join heaven's sound 
 Can you hear it now

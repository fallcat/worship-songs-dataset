How long must I pray 
 Must I pray to You 
 How long must I wait 
 Must I wait for You 
 How long till I see Your face 
 See You shining through 
 I'm on my knees 
 Begging You to notice me 
 I'm on my knees 
 Father, will You turn to me 
 One tear in the driving rain 
 One voice in a sea of pain 
 Could the maker of the stars 
 Hear the sound of my breaking heart 
 One life, that's all I am 
 Right now I can barely stand 
 If You're everything You say You are 
 Would You come close and hold my heart 
 I've been so afraid, afraid to close my eyes 
 So much can slip away before I say goodbye 
 But if there's no other way 
 I'm done asking why 
 'Cause I'm on my knees 
 Begging You to notice me 
 I'm on my knees 
 Father, will You run to me, yeah 
 One tear in the driving rain 
 One voice in a sea of pain 
 Could the maker of the stars 
 Hear the sound of my breaking heart 
 One life, that's all I am 
 Right now I can barely stand 
 If You're everything You say You are 
 Would You come close and hold my heart 
 So many questions without answers 
 Your promises remain 
 I can't see but I'll take my chances 
 To hear you call my name 
 To hear you call my name 
 One tear in the driving rain 
 One voice in a sea of pain 
 Could the maker of the stars 
 Hear the sound of my breaking heart 
 One life, that's all I am 
 Right now I can barely stand 
 If You're everything You say You are 
 Would You come close and hold my heart 
 Hold my heart 
 Could You hold my heart 
 Hold my heart

Feel the silence 
 There's a war beneath our skin 
 Let it begin 
 It's hard to fight 
 It's hard to lead resistance 
 It's our hearts we're up against 
 This world it keeps us 
 Promising freedom 
 We though we could belong 
 But we don't belong here 
 Don't let us wander 
 To arms of another 
 Oh, Father, Yours forever 
 Let us be 
 A hostage of peace 
 We need a rescue 
 Need a love we can't resist 
 Break our defenses 
 Take us captive 
 Take our thoughts and take control 
 We're losing control 
 This world it keeps us 
 Promising freedom 
 We though we could belong 
 But we don't belong here 
 Don't let us wander 
 To arms of another 
 Oh, Father, Yours forever 
 Let us be 
 A hostage of peace 
 If we're fighting 
 Let it be for you Your kingdom 
 If we're violent 
 Let it be against ourselves 
 Come arrest us 
 With your affection 
 Give us freedom 
 Make our need our only declaration 
 Oh, Father keep us 
 They promise freedom 
 We though we could belong 
 But we don't belong here 
 Don't let us wander 
 To arms of another 
 Oh, Father, Yours forever 
 Let us be 
 A hostage of peace

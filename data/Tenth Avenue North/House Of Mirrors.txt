You can't seem to see past your own reflection 
 Caught up in the halls of your introspection 
 And you're staring at your mirror on the wall 
 Asking, "Who is the fairest of them all?" 
 â€˜Cause, Lord, I know it's not me 
 If only you could see 
 That you've already been set free 
 Come on, come on 
 Let's throw our mirrors down 
 Come on, come on 
 Let's shatter the glass on the ground 
 But you say, "Hold on, if I could just try this one thing. 
 Well, I know I can change and that would change everything." 
 But a house made of mirrors never helps you see any clearer 
 It's yourself you can't see past 
 And Lord isn't that just like me? 
 If only we could see 
 That He's already set us free 
 Come on, come on 
 Let's throw our mirrors down 
 Come on, come on 
 Let's shatter the glass on the ground 
 Oh, oh 
 Freedom's waiting for you now 
 So come on, come on 
 Throw your mirrors down 
 Come on if you're tired take a step outside 
 You might find you can forget about yourself tonight 
 Come on if you're tired of failed attempts to try 
 Freedom's waiting when you look outside 
 Come on, come on 
 Let's throw our mirrors down 
 Come on, come on 
 Let's shatter the glass on the ground 
 Oh, oh 
 Freedom's waiting for you now 
 So come on, come on 
 Throw your mirrors down

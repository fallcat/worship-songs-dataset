I try to linger in the sunlight 
 Everyday I'm alive 
 But at night the restlessness takes over 
 And I'm scared of what's inside 
 So I confess, I admit 
 I look for life outside of You 
 I repent, I'm coming back 
 To the only joy that's true 
 I don't wanna look in a stranger's eyes 
 When I come into this place 
 Let me grow familiar with the lives 
 The lives upon your face 
 One thing is all I will ask You 
 To feel my heart satisfied 
 To know You, trust You 
 Love and behold You 
 Savior, only You are kind 
 I confess, I admit 
 I look for life outside of You 
 I repent, I'm coming back 
 To the only joy that's true 
 I don't wanna look in a stranger's eyes 
 When I come into this place 
 Let me grow familiar with the lines 
 The lines upon your face 
 Yea, oh 
 Yea the lines on Your face 
 See the lines on Your face 
 Yesterday felt like it would never end 
 I couldn't confess so I kept on falling 
 Yea I kept on falling 
 Yea, oh keep me from falling 
 So I confess, I admit 
 I look for life outside of You 
 I repent, I'm coming back 
 To the only joy that's true 
 I don't wanna look in a stranger's eyes 
 When I come into this place 
 Let me grow familiar with the lines 
 The lines upon your face 
 Yea the lines on Your face 
 See the lines on Your face 
 Yea I wanna look in Your eyes 
 I wanna look in Your eyes 
 Yesterday felt like it would never end 
 Now I'm coming back 
 Lord keep me from falling

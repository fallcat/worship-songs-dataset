As I walk this great unknown 
 Questions come and questions go 
 Was there purpose for the pain? 
 Did I cry these tears in vain? 
 I don't want to live in fear 
 I want to trust that You are near 
 Trust Your grace can be seen 
 In both triumph and tragedy 
 I have this hope 
 In the depth of my soul 
 In the flood or the fire 
 You're with me and You won't let go 
 But sometimes my faith feels thin 
 Like the night will never end 
 Will You catch every tear 
 Or will You just leave me here? 
 But I have this hope 
 In the depth of my soul 
 In the flood or the fire 
 You're with me and You won't let go 
 But I have this hope 
 In the depth of my soul 
 In the flood or the fire 
 You're with me and You won't let go 
 So, whatever happens I will not be afraid 
 Cause You are closer than this breath that I take 
 You calm the storm when I hear You call my name 
 I still believe that one day I'll see Your face 
 And I have this hope 
 In the depth of my soul 
 In the flood or the fire 
 You're with me 
 I have this hope 
 In the depth of my soul 
 In the flood or the fire 
 You're with me and You won't let go 
 In the flood or the fire 
 You're with me and You won't let go 
 In the flood or the fire 
 You're with me and You won't let go

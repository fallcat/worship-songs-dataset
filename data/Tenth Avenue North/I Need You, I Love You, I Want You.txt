I need you 
 I love you 
 I want you 
 No one else can make me new 
 I need you 
 I love you 
 I want you 
 No one else can make me new 
 Your joy is better than wine 
 It's better than love 
 It's better than life 
 Your joy is where my heart sings 
 It's where I belong 
 It's where I believe 
 I need you 
 I love you 
 I want you 
 No one else can make me new 
 I need you 
 I love you 
 I want you 
 No one else can make me new 
 I will wait for only you 
 No one else can make me new 
 No one else can break the silence 
 I will wait for only you 
 My heart needs to hear what's true 
 No one else will break the silence 
 I will wait for only you 
 No one loves me like you do 
 No one else can break the silence 
 So I will wait for only you 
 No one else can pull me through 
 No one else will break the silence 
 I need you 
 I love you 
 I want you 
 No one else can make me new 
 I need you 
 I love you 
 I want you 
 No one else can make me new 
 No one else can make me new 
 No one else can make me new

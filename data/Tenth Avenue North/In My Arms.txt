Well its about time you made some sence 
 You gotta throw down your 10 foot fence 
 And realize that its time to relax baby 
 Came back put some slack on 
 Rest till the days are all gone 
 Keep dreaming about ur dreams baby 
 Cause its plain to see life is taking over you 
 Its hard to find some down time 
 So just stay with me fall into my arms again 
 Everything you need is right here in my arms 
 Well I see the hurt in your eyes 
 Stress made the tears you've cried 
 Well that's not what I'm all about baby 
 Let me be the your sholder to cry 
 Let me wipe the tear from your eye 
 Came back slacked relaxed baby 
 Cause its plain to see life is taking over you 
 Its hard to find some down time 
 So just stay with me fall into my arms again 
 Everything you need is right here in my arms

King of all the earth and every age 
 All creation waits for You, and trembles at Your name 
 Surrounded on a throne of endless praise 
 Fire and lighting flash from the glory of Your face 
 And I sing to You: 
 You are holy 
 You are worthy 
 You are holy 
 You're the Lamb of God 
 How do I dare approach 
 This Holy One 
 The One who was and is... 
 Was and is to come 
 The world and righteousness and mystery 
 We've only just begun, just begun to sing 
 So I'll come broken through 
 The blood of Your son 
 And I'll kneel before You 
 You are holy 
 You are worthy 
 You are holy 
 You're the Lamb of God 
 Blessing and honor, 
 And glory and power 
 To Him who sits on the throne 
 Blessing and honor 
 And glory and power 
 Forever to our God alone 
 You are holy 
 You are worthy 
 You are holy 
 You're the Lamb of God 
 You are Holy Lord 
 Holy God 
 You are Holy Lord

I've been holding on so tight 
 Look at these knuckles they've gone white 
 From fighting for who I want to be 
 I'm just trying to find security 
 But you say let it go 
 You say let it go 
 You say life is waiting for the one's who lose control 
 You say You will be everything I need 
 You say if I lose my life it's then I'll find my soul 
 You say let it go 
 Well it's hard enough to hear 
 Harder still to move beyond this fear 
 We know there's nothing I can bring 
 So tell me what do you want from me 
 You say let it go 
 You say let it go 
 You say life is waiting for the one's who lose control 
 You say You will be everything I need 
 You say if I lose my life it's then I'll find my soul 
 You say let it go 
 You say let it go 
 Oh... 
 What do I love 
 What do I hate 
 What will I lose 
 What will I gain 
 How do I save my soul, oh 
 What if I bend 
 What if I break 
 What will it cost 
 What will it take 
 For You to save my soul, oh 
 You say let it go 
 You say let it go 
 You say life is waiting for the one's who lose control 
 You say You will be everything I need 
 You say if I lose my life it's then I'll find my soul 
 You say let it go 
 You say let it go 
 You say life is waiting for the one's who lose control 
 You say You will be everything I need 
 You say if I lose my life it's then I'll find my soul 
 You say let it go 
 You say let it go

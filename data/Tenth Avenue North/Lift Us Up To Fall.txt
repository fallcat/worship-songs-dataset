You move the earth 
 You hold the stars 
 Come move in us 
 Come hold our hearts 
 You send the rain 
 And life begins 
 So rain on us and reign within our lives again 
 We're waiting here 
 Waiting for you, God 
 With our hopes and fears 
 We come empty hands held out 
 Lord, draw us near 
 Heal these broken hearts 
 And lift us up to fall before everything You are 
 Yeah, before everything You are 
 You lift the sun into the sky 
 You lift us up 
 Open our eyes 
 To see Your face 
 And what You've done 
 You took the nails to give us love 
 And we stand in awe before Your throne 
 There's no where else that we can go 
 We're waiting here 
 Waiting for you, God 
 With our hopes and fears 
 We come empty hands held out 
 Lord, draw us near 
 Heal these broken hearts 
 And lift us up to fall before everything You are 
 Come, O Come, Emmanuel 
 Come Lord, here to dwell 
 Let all Your children lift one voice 
 Hear us sing now... 
 We're waiting here 
 Waiting for you, God 
 With our hopes and fears 
 We come empty hands held out 
 Lord, draw us near 
 Heal these broken hearts 
 And lift us up to fall 
 Lift us up to fall... 
 We're waiting here 
 Waiting for you, God 
 With our hopes and fears 
 We come empty hands held out 
 Lord, draw us near 
 Heal these broken hearts 
 And lift us up to fall before everything You are 
 Yeah, before everything You are 
 Ohhh...

I can't believe what she said 
 I can't believe what he did 
 Oh, don't they know it's wrong 
 Don't they know it's wrong 
 Well maybe there's something I missed 
 But how could they treat me like this 
 It's wearing out my heart 
 The way they disregard 
 This is love or this is hate 
 We all have a choice to make 
 Oh, Father won't You forgive them 
 They don't know what they've been doing 
 Oh Father, give me grace to forgive them 
 'Cause I feel like the one losing 
 Well it's only the dead that can live 
 But still I wrestle with this 
 To lose the pain that's mine 
 Seventy times seven times 
 Cause Lord it doesn't feel right 
 For me to turn a blind eye 
 Though I guess it's not that much 
 When I think of what You've done 
 This is love or this is hate 
 We've got a choice to make 
 Oh, Father won't You forgive them 
 They don't know what they've been doing 
 Oh, Father give me grace to forgive them 
 'Cause I feel like the one losing 
 Why do we think that our hate's gonna break a hard heart 
 We're rippin arms over wars that don't need to be fought 
 Cause pride won't let us lay our weapons on the ground 
 We build our bridges up but it's just to burn them down 
 We think our pain is own apologies and get them to stop 
 Well truth be told it doesn't matter if they're sorry or not 
 Cause freedom comes when we surrender to the sound 
 Of Your mercy and Your grace, Father, send Your angels down 
 Oh, Father wont you forgive them 
 They don't know what they've been doing 
 Oh, Father give me grace to forgive them 
 'Cause I feel like the one losing 
 I feel like I've been losing 
 Oh, Father won't you forgive them 
 They don't know what they've been doing 
 Oh, Father give me grace to forgive them 
 'Cause I feel like the one losing 
 I feel like I've been losing 
 Oh Father, give me grace to forgive them 
 'Cause I feel like the one losing

Come to the Water 
 You who thirst and you'll thirst no more 
 Come to the Father 
 You who work and you'll work no more 
 And all you who labor in vain

 Love is near it satisfies 
 Streams of mercy flowing from His side 
 'Cause Love is here 
 Come to the Treasure 
 You who search and you'll search no more 
 Come to the Lover

 And all you who labor in vain 
 And to the broken and shamed, yeah 
 Love is here 
 Love is now

 Love is near it satisfies 
 Streams of mercy flowing from His side, yeah 
 And to the bruised and fallen 
 Captives bound and brokenhearted 
 He is the Lord, He is the Lord, yeah 
 By His stripes He's paid our ransom 
 From His wounds we drink salvation 
 He is the Lord, He is the Lord 
 Love is here 
 Love is now 
 Love is pouring from His hands, from His brow 
 Love is near it satisfies 
 Streams of mercy flowing from His side 
 Streams of mercy flowing from His side

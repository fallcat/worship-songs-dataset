Desire is burning in my mind 
 Like a firefly is lighting up the sky 
 My heart is aglow 
 I feel you burnin' up my soul 
 Yeah, I'm a shipwreck 
 A sailor lost at sea 
 You're a tidal wave 
 That's crashing over me 
 I'm caught in your current, but I'm sinking 
 And drowning peacefully 
 Well, I'm crying out come rescue me with love 
 Like a child needs a night light in the dark 
 Lord, light me up, I'm lovesick for just one touch 
 Well, now, you're all I need, but you never seem to be enough 
 I'm Romeo, desperate for your love 
 I'd scale these garden walls 
 Just to see the risin' sun 
 But see what light breaks softly through 
 It's love that I never knew 
 No, I never knew 
 Well, I'm crying out come rescue me with love 
 Like a child needs a night light in the dark 
 Lord, light me up, I'm lovesick for just one touch 
 Well, now, you're all I need, but you never seem to be enough 
 Well, I'm crying out come rescue me with love 
 Like a child needs a night light in the dark 
 Lord, light me up, I'm lovesick for just one touch 
 Well, now, you're all I need, but you never seem to be enough 
 Never seem to be enough for me, Lord

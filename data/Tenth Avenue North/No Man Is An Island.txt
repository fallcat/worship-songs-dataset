I won't run, I will stay 
 I'm not leaving you 
 I know there's friction here 
 The struggle makes us new 
 I wish you never thought you had to go 
 Wish you never thought you had to leave 
 Together we can lift each other up 
 We can build a shelter for the weak 
 No man is an island, we can be found 
 No man is an island, let your guard down 
 You don't have to fight me, I am for you 
 We're not meant to live this life alone 
 I see fear in your eyes 
 There's no safety here 
 Oh, my friend, let me in 
 I will share your tears 
 I wish you never thought you had to go 
 I wish you never thought you had to leave 
 We can always lift each other up 
 We can build a shelter for the weak, come on 
 No man is an island, we can be found 
 No man is an island, let your guard down 
 Please don't try to fight me, I am for you 
 We're not meant to live this life alone 
 Through trouble, rain, or fire 
 Let's reach out to something higher 
 Ain't no life outside each other 
 We are not alone 
 Through trouble, rain, or fire 
 Let's reach out to something higher 
 Eyes open to one another 
 We are not alone 
 No man is alone 
 Why you try to fight me 
 We don't have to do it alone 
 We don't have to do it alone 
 We don't have to do it alone

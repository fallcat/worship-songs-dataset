Even when the fear surrounds us 
 Even in the dead of night 
 Even in the darkest shadow 
 You will never our side 
 Even when our dreams are shattered 
 And all of our strength gives way 
 You're the hope that can't be taken 
 Even in the midst of pain 
 No one can steal our joy 
 Nothing can ever destroy the light in our eyes 
 Christ our delight 
 Our hope and reward 
 No one can steal our joy 
 No one can steal our joy 
 Even if our hearts betray us 
 And tears are falling down my face 
 If we ever feel forsaken 
 We know You have felt the same 
 Even when we fight temptation 
 Even when we stand accused 
 We know that you will defend us 
 We can always run to You 
 No one can steal our joy 
 Nothing can ever destroy the light in our eyes 
 Christ our delight 
 Our hope and reward 
 No one can steal our joy 
 No one can steal our joy 
 What can man do to us? 
 What can help grow in us? 
 We give our idols up 
 The best is yet to come 
 Oh, we give our idols up 
 The best is yet to come 
 No one can steal our joy 
 No one can steal our joy 
 Nothing can ever destroy the light in our eyes 
 Christ our delight 
 Our hope and reward 
 No one can steal our joy 
 No one can feel our joy 
 Oh oh no 
 Oh oh, no one can steal our joy

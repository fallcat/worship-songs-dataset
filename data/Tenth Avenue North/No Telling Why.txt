Windows down radio blaring 
 Your hair down in your eyes and 
 You dance like no one's watching at all 
 Like a child 
 Head back laughin', crying 
 The pedal down as we keep driving 
 You never ask are we there yet 
 Like a child 
 And we drive 
 We drive on into the night 
 Yeah we drive 
 Don't think twice not to say goodbye 
 Your hands out, playing with the wind 
 As its kissin' all your fingertips 
 And you smell the rain 
 As it starts pouring in (like we care) 
 The clock reads 2 am 
 It's been so far 
 But we just started this 
 No telling where, why, or how far it's been (like we care) 
 We just drive 
 We drive on into the night 
 Yeah we drive 
 Don't think twice not to say goodbye 
 Yeah we drive 
 We drive on into the night 
 Yeah we drive 
 To find the morning light 
 Come with me 
 Leave your hate, your fears 
 Don't look back 
 Leave the past behind 
 Come with me 
 Bring your heart, your dreams 
 Don't look back 
 We don't need to hide 
 In the morning light... 
 In the morning light 
 Sit back, enjoy the ride 
 In the morning light 
 Look up, hold on tight (hold on tight) 
 Come with me 
 Leave your hate, your fears 
 Don't look back 
 Leave the past behind you 
 Come with me 
 Bring your heart, your dreams 
 Don't look back 
 We don't need to hide 
 Come with me 
 Leave your hate, your fears 
 Don't look back 
 Leave the past behind 
 Come with me 
 Bring your heart, your dreams 
 Don't look back 
 We don't need to hide 
 We don't need to hide...

I called you up, you were in bed 
 Could barely make out the words that you said 
 But you wanted to see me instead so I got dressed 
 Then I stepped out into the snow 
 And walked for a mile or so 
 Felt the rush of blood come from the cold in my chest 
 You finally came to the door 
 And we talked for an hour or more 
 Until I asked if you would stay up till four 
 You said, "That's fine." 
 But you said, "There's something I have to say, 
 And I can't because I'm just so afraid." 
 And so I held you as you started to shake that night 
 Oh, my dear I'll wait for you 
 Grace tonight will pull us through 
 Until the tears have left your eyes 
 Until the fears can sleep at night 
 Until the demons that you're scared of disappear inside 
 Until this guilt begins to crack and the weight falls from your back 
 Oh, my dear I'll keep you in my arms tonight 
 You slowly lifted your head from your hands 
 You said, "I just don't think that you'll understand, 
 You'll never look at me that way again if you knew what I did." 
 And so your tears fell and melted the snow 
 You told me secrets nobody had known 
 But I never loved you more even though now I knew what you did 
 Oh, my dear I'll wait for you 
 Grace tonight will pull us through 
 Until the tears have left your eyes 
 Until the fears can sleep at night 
 Until the demons that you're scared of disappear inside 
 Until this guilt begins to crack and the weight falls from your back 
 Oh, my dear I'll keep you in my arms tonight 
 'll keep you in my arms tonight

Love, I have waited for you 
 And love, I was wounded for you 
 Won't you look into my eyes 
 Through the pain and through your pride 
 And find I am true 
 You're the one I can't deny 
 And I'll never leave your side 
 I gave my life for you 
 So what are you waiting for? 
 On and on we go 
 Come love take my hand 
 On and on we go 
 Time and time again 
 On and on we go 
 Back to where this all began 
 Come love take my hand 
 Life is waiting for you 
 And life I have given to you 
 Tell me what else can I do 
 What more have I left to prove? 
 That I am what you need 
 Still I will hold on to your heart 
 Through the chaos and the dark 
 When your eyes fail to see 
 So what are you waiting for? 
 On and on we go 
 Come love take my hand 
 On and on we go 
 As you run away again 
 On and on we go 
 Back to where this all began 
 Broken I was for you 
 Broken I'm still for you 
 My broken heart breaks for you 
 Broken I'm over you 
 On and on we go 
 On and on we go 
 On and on we go 
 Come love take my hand 
 On and on we go 
 As you run away again 
 On and on we go 
 Back to where this all began 
 Come love take my hand 
 Come love take my hand

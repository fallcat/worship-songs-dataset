You don't really know what you need 
 And you've got nothing 
 You don't really know what you believe 
 And you've been broken 
 You don't really know what you treasure now 
 Till it all comes crashing down 
 I can see so clearly now 
 If I've got nothing but You 
 I'll still have everything I need 
 You're the one thing I can't loose 
 When I've run to the end of me 
 Everything I though I lost 
 I found it all in You, my God 
 You're the one thing, one thing 
 One thing, one thing I need 
 All of the want and all the plans 
 I've been chasing 
 All of the dreams in my heart 
 You can take them 
 'Cause all of the beauty starts to fade 
 In a light of just one place 
 I can see so clearly now 
 If I've got nothing but You 
 I'll still have everything I need 
 You're the one thing I can't loose 
 When I've run to the end of me 
 Everything I though I lost 
 I found it all in You, my God 
 You're the one thing, one thing 
 One thing 
 My soul will cry 
 This one thing I know 
 You will only satisfy 
 My soul will cry 
 This one thing I know 
 You will only satisfy 
 If I've got nothing but You 
 I'll still have everything I need 
 You're the one thing I can't loose 
 When I've run to the end of me 
 If I've got nothing but You 
 I'll still have everything I need 
 You're the one thing I can't loose 
 When I've run to the end of me 
 Everything I though I lost 
 I found it all in You, my God 
 You're the one thing, one thing 
 One thing, one thing I need 
 The one thing I need

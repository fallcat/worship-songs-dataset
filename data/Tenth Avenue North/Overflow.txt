Hands open up 
 Hands open up 
 Out of the dust 
 You created us 
 We are the breath of Father, Spirit, and Son 
 We're free to breathe 
 We're free to move 
 Life is a gift that we give back to You 
 Life is our gift that we give back to You 
 You set our hearts in motion 
 You're alive inside us 
 Our hands open up (hands open up) 
 We are made in the image of a perfect union 
 We receive Your love and overflow 
 We overflow 
 It's evident 
 That we were meant 
 To live like grace is covering every step 
 So we can risk 
 Yeah we can fall 
 You're over and you're underneath of it all 
 You're over and you're underneath of us all 
 You set our hearts in motion 
 You're alive inside us 
 Our hands open up (hands open up) 
 We are made in the image of a perfect union 
 We receive Your love and overflow 
 We overflow 
 Oh, overflow, oh, oh 
 Oh, overflow, oh, oh 
 Let Your perfect love come and fill us up 
 Till we can't help but oh, overflow, oh, oh 
 Hearts in motion 
 You're alive inside us 
 Our hands open up (hands open up) 
 We are made in the image of a perfect union 
 We receive Your love and overflow 
 We overflow 
 Living in the overflow 
 We overflow 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, overflow, oh, oh (hands open up) 
 Oh, overflow, oh, oh

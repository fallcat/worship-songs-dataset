How could it be that I've fallen this far? 
 Asleep to the truth, yet awake in the dark. 
 I fell for the trick, how ungrateful 
 I've become in Your eyes. 
 Am I so foolish to chase and demand, 
 Things of this earth that were made by Your hand. 
 Drawn in deceit by exchanging 
 Your truth for a lie. 
 Satisfy my soul. 
 And drown my heart in Yours. 
 'Til I find that all of me desires You. 
 When I consider the moon and the stars 
 Excuse have I none, to describe who You are. 
 And still I exalt the created. 
 Oh Lover of mine, bring sight to my eyes. 
 Satisfy my soul. 
 And drown my heart in Yours. 
 'Til I find that all of me desires You. 
 Beautiful, Wonderful, Colorful, Maker 
 What if we could only see You, the Creator. (repeat) 
 Satisfy my soul. 
 And drown my heart in Yours. 
 'Til I find that all of me desires You.

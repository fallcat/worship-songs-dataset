Before the sun has touched the sky 
 Colors bursting from Your eyes 
 Before the flood of the morning light 
 Before the earth has felt Your heat 
 Before I stand up to my feet 
 Before I begin to feel this weak 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 I'm begging You, help me see 
 You're all I want, You're what I need 
 Oh satisfy me, Lord 
 And when the day is closing in like the stars in the night 
 I am falling into the pull of the earth and its affections 
 In me, O Lord, can You create a pure heart 
 Because I'm afraid that I just might run back 
 To the things I hate 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 Yeah I'm begging You, help me see 
 You're all I want, You're what I need 
 Oh satisfy me, Lord 
 You're beautiful 
 You're beautiful 
 You're more than all this world can give 
 You're beautiful 
 You're beautiful 
 Your love is all I need to live 
 You're beautiful 
 You're beautiful 
 You're more than all this world can give 
 You're beautiful 
 More beautiful 
 Your love is all I need to live 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 Yeah I'm begging You to help me see 
 You're all I want, You're what I need 
 Oh satisfy me, Lord 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 Satisfy me, Lord, oh 
 Yeah I'm begging You, help me see 
 You're all I want, You're what I need 
 Oh satisfy me, Lord 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

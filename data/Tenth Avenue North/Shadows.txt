We're born into the longing 
 With hearts, bent toward possessing 
 All that our eyes are seeing 
 Our souls, they never stop wanting 
 Beauty never intended to be more than a reflection 
 Oh, Lord, light up my dark eyes 
 Teach me to let go 
 I've been runnin' 
 Chasing nothing but shadows 
 My heart is an ocean raging 
 And Your grace is all that keeps me from drowning 
 My mind creates deceptions 
 So I cling the treasure sinking 
 Oh, Lord, light up my dark eyes 
 Teach me to let go 
 I've been runnin' 
 Chasing nothing but shadows 
 Oh, Lord, please come and 
 Raise my dead heart, let me know 
 You can keep me from 
 Chasing after the shadows 
 All that I run to, all that I cling to 
 Everything seems to only slip through my hands 
 All that I run to, all that I cling to 
 Everything seems to only slip through my hands 
 But I keep running, I keep chasing 
 Left holding on to only the after glow 
 Lord, light up my eyes, let me follow You 
 To the source behind all the shadows 
 I keep running, I keep chasing 
 Left holding on to only the after glow 
 Lord, light up my eyes, let me follow You 
 To the source behind all the shadows 
 Oh, Lord, light up my dark eyes 
 Teach me to let go 
 I've been runnin' 
 Chasing nothing but shadows 
 Oh, Lord, please come and 
 Raise my dead heart, let me know 
 You can keep me from 
 Chasing after the shadows 
 The shadows 
 Keep runnin', keep runnin', keep runnin'

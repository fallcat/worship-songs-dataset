From the surface of my skin 
 To the depths of my soul within 
 I give you all of me 
 All the secrets of my heart 
 Every word and every thought 
 I give you all of me 
 Oh my heart's in need of holding 
 And my soul's in need of truth 
 Come be near me 
 Come surrond me, yeah 
 I lift my hands in sweet surrender 
 I'm falling humbly on my knees 
 I fix my gaze upon your splendor 
 How I love your majesty 
 You captivate me 
 Come into my darkest place 
 Step inside, invade this space 
 I give you all of me 
 All the secrets of my heart 
 Every word and every thought 
 I give you all of me

I heard Your eyes are on the faithful 
 You delight in all Your saints 
 But for what of those of us who wander 
 In the darkness and the stakes? 
 Oh I need to know You see me 
 My face down on this floor 
 Have I escaped this cope of mercy? 
 God, is there still more? 
 You see the sparrow 
 You see me here 
 Where the pain of my past 
 And the depth of my fear 
 You see my future 
 One day I'll rise 
 My hope is secure under Heaven's eyes, under Heaven's eyes 
 Heaven's eyes 
 Under Heaven's eyes, under Heaven's eyes 
 Couldn't ever outrun Your presence 
 You see beginnings from their end 
 Even the dark is light to You, Lord 
 And You keep on whispering 
 Take courage dear heart 
 Take courage dear heart 
 You can never fall that far 
 You can never fall that far 
 You see the sparrow 
 You see me here 
 Where the pain of my past 
 And the depth of my fear 
 You see my future 
 One day I'll rise 
 My hope is secure under Heaven's eyes, under Heaven's eyes 
 Heaven's eyes 
 Under Heaven's eyes, under Heaven's eyes 
 I sing because I'm happy 
 And I sing because I'm free 
 Your eyes are on the sparrow 
 And I know You're watching me 
 You see the sparrow 
 You see me here 
 Where the pain of my past 
 And the depth of my fear 
 You see my future 
 One day I'll rise 
 My hope is secure under Heaven's eyes, under Heaven's eyes 
 Heaven's eyes 
 Under Heaven's eyes, under Heaven's eyes

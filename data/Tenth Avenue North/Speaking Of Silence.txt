There's a stillness in my heart 
 And a quiet in my soul 
 That I never stop to hear 
 There's a whisper crying out 
 Through a silent microphone 
 And it never disappears 
 Speaking of silence 
 We just play the music loud 
 We listen to the crowd 
 We laugh to numb the pain we share 
 And we know that talk is easy 
 It's the lonliness we fear 
 We could listen but we're scared 
 Are you there 
 Coming down to the ground 
 Kneeling down I can hear the sound 
 Of your voice 
 Here to find the time to realign 
 Quiet the deafening lies 
 Lord I need you 
 Whisper softly 
 Hold me gently in your arms 
 And cradle me with love 
 Hold me close 
 Let me feel you breathe 
 Overwhelming love 
 Come speak to me 
 Take my love rid me of my hate 
 Still my beating heart 
 Lord kiss my face 
 Take these tears 
 You've got to set me free 
 Raise new life 
 To all the dead places inside me 
 Hold me close 
 I need to feel you breathe 
 Calm these storms that 
 Rage inside of me

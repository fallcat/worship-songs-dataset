No matter where you lead 
 We want to follow you 
 The trouble is we forget who we belong to 
 We chase the wind and tides 
 We chase the reasons why 
 Chase the spark inside each other's eyes 
 Desires are at war 
 We want that final shore 
 Sailing on until we find what we've been looking for 
 Hallelujah 
 We're running to you 
 On fire from the mercy in your eyes 
 And through the dark 
 Singing we are yours 
 Your love will lead us through the fight 
 Like stars in the night 
 Stars in the night 
 Stars in the night 
 Lead us through the fight 
 We fix our eyes on what we know is true 
 Even in our shame grace makes a way through 
 Be our obsession, our constellation 
 You are light in and out of every season 
 So we keep pressing on 
 With our redemption song 
 No one can undo what you've done 
 Hallelujah 
 We're running to you 
 On fire from the mercy in your eyes 
 And through the dark 
 Singing we are yours 
 Your love will lead us through the fight 
 Like stars in the night 
 All our lives 
 For the other side 
 Where we'll never die 
 And in the darkest night 
 We will lift our eyes 
 The life that lies ahead is more than all we leave behind 
 Hallelujah 
 We're running to you 
 On fire from the mercy in your eyes 
 And through the dark 
 Singing we are yours 
 Your love will lead us through the fight 
 Like stars in the night 
 Stars in the night 
 Stars in the night 
 Lead us through this fight 
 Stars in the night

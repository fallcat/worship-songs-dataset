I have run through field and mountain 
 I have waited for the dawn 
 Gave you heart and soul and body 
 For the promise of your love 
 I will not let the fear take over 
 I will not head the siren's song 
 I have seen miracles break like thunder 
 So I will wait till the feeling comes 
 Oh my love, I will fight my heart to keep you safe here 
 All my life, I will stay 
 Stay 
 Oh my love, we are light, a mirror of love eternal 
 How could I walk away 
 Stay, stay, stay, stay 
 We can learn to choose each other 
 Face to face and hand in hand 
 Fire dies and tempest crashes 
 But we won't let the darkness in 
 I will not let the fear take over 
 I will not heed the siren's song 
 I have seen miracles breathe like thunder 
 So I will wait till the feeling comes 
 Oh my love, I will fight my heart to keep you safe here 
 All my life, I will stay 
 Stay 
 Oh my love, we are light, a mirror of love eternal 
 How could I walk away 
 Stay, stay, stay, stay 
 Oh lord, I will stay here 
 Oh love come take my hand tonight 
 Can we remember what was revealed in the sunlight 
 For rich or poor, I won't leave your side 
 We can walk safely together through the battle lines 
 Oh my love, I will fight my heart to keep you safe here 
 All my life, I will stay 
 Stay 
 Oh my love, we are light, a mirror of love eternal 
 How could I walk away 
 Stay, stay, stay, stay 
 Oh love come take my hand tonight 
 Can we remember what was revealed in the sunlight

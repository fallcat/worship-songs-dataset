I know you're tired of the hurt and the heartache 
 You feel like giving in 
 You feel like walking away 
 And I know it's difficult 
 Feeling so out of place 
 But this is not how it's gonna be 
 Your pain is temporary 
 We're all strangers here 
 So it's alright if you can't 
 Stop the tears 
 That you cry 
 'Cause someday we'll touch 
 The face of our God 
 And the sorrow will disappear 
 Until then we're strangers here 
 That's hard to hear if you want to keep chasing 
 This broken world that only keeps your heart breaking 
 So if you're scared 'cause you think that you're missing out 
 This is not the ending 
 No, this is not the ending 
 We're all strangers here 
 So it's alright if you can't 
 Stop the tears 
 That you cry 
 'Cause someday we'll touch 
 The face of our God 
 And the sorrow will disappear 
 Until then we're strangers here 
 This is not the homeland 
 We can see the lights from here 
 He's making us a city 
 Where there are no fears 
 And it's drawing near 
 Until then 
 We're strangers here 
 We're just 
 Strangers here 
 We're all strangers here 
 So it's alright if you can't 
 Stop the tears 
 'Cause some day we'll touch 
 The face of our God 
 And the sorrow will disappear 
 Until then we're strangers here 
 Strangers here

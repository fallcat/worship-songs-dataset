You fought but you were just too weak 
 So you lost all the things you tried to keep 
 Now you're on your knees 
 You’re on your knees 
 But wait everything can change 
 In a moments' time 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 ‘Cause fear is just a lie 
 Open up your eyes 
 And He'll break open the skies to save 
 Those who cry out His name 
 The one the wind and waves obey 
 Is strong enough to save you 
 Look now is not too late 
 Lift up your head 
 Let the rain fall on your face 
 You’re not far from grace 
 You’re not too far from grace 
 And He'll break open the skies to save 
 Those who cry out His name 
 The one the wind and waves obey 
 Is strong enough to save you 
 Break open the skies to save 
 Those who cry out His name 
 The one the wind and waves obey 
 Is strong enough to save you 
 I know the weight of this world can take you down like gravity 
 I know the current of yourself can take you out, out to sea 
 But hold on 
 Hold on 
 And He'll break open the skies to save 
 Those who cry out His name 
 The one the wind and waves obey 
 Is strong enough to save you 
 Break open the skies to save 
 Those who cry out His name 
 The one the wind and waves obey 
 Is strong enough to save you

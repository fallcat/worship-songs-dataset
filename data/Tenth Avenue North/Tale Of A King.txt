Stick around and notice that there's 
 More to me then what you know 
 Even though your doubts are speaking 
 All of those have got to go 
 How you think I'm full of anger 
 How you thought I'm just no fun 
 Get off of your keister now 
 And figure out whos the only one 
 And as you go (and as you go) 
 I hope you see (I hope you see) 
 What you mean to me 
 I'm so in love I'm finding us 
 A tale of a king 
 Evey now and then ill notice 
 Every time I come your way 
 With a vicious glance 
 You turn around and have nothing to say 
 Could it be that your just angry 
 Could it be that I'm just right 
 Forget about tomarrow 
 Cause right now you have to hold on tight 
 And as you go (and as you go) 
 I hope you see (I hope you see) 
 What you mean to me 
 I'm so in love I'm finding us 
 A tale of a king 
 Let me cut my anchor here 
 Find a place to call my own 
 'Cause I know that space is bigger left alone 
 It's your heart in surching for 
 But until you let me in ill pound this door 
 And as you go (and as you go) 
 I hope you see (I hope you see) 
 What you mean to me 
 I'm so in love I'm finding us 
 And as you go (and as you go) 
 I hope you see (I hope you see) 
 What you mean to me 
 I'm so in love I'm finding us 
 So in love to finding us 
 It's your love I'm finding us 
 A tale of a king 
 A tale of a king 
 A tale of a king 
 Yeah yeah yeah

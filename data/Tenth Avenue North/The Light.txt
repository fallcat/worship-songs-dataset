I have run into the darkness 
 I have hidden from your rays 
 From the light of your salvation 
 To the shadows I am embrace 
 Could you find me in this valley 
 In this hatred I have loved 
 Can the god who see's the future 
 Still be bind to all I've done 
 Love invade the night 
 Morning satisfy 
 Mercy floods the sky 
 The sky 
 Your are the light 
 Father and savior 
 Spirit divine 
 Truth and the life 
 You are the light 
 Father and savior 
 Holy spirit divine 
 Giver of life 
 You are the light 
 My sin has left me cold and shaking 
 At your throne I am undone 
 But I can feel your joys rising 
 Underneath right heaven's sun 
 Love invade the night 
 Morning you satisfy 
 Mercy floods the sky 
 The sky 
 Your are the light 
 Father and savior 
 Spirit divine 
 Truth and the life 
 You are the light 
 Father and savior 
 Holy spirit divine 
 Giver of life 
 You are the light 
 You are the light 
 Words can't define you 
 Fail to describe you 
 You're more than I can say 
 But the heavens speak 
 The sky cries out now 
 In colors of your grace 
 Of your grace... 
 Your are the light 
 Father and savior 
 Spirit divine 
 Truth and the life 
 You are the light 
 Father and savior 
 Holy spirit divine 
 Giver of life 
 You are the light 
 You are the light 
 Love invades the night 
 Morning you satisfy 
 Your mercy floods the sky

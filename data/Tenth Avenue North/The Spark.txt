Is this the spark where it begins 
 We find freedom from our sins 
 Is this the place I finally trust 
 Your presence is enough to 
 Speak light in my darkness 
 Speak life till I know 
 There's strength for my weakness 
 Slow down oh my soul 
 You are where my soul finds rest 
 You are where I lay my head 
 Your grace lets me catch my breath 
 Lets me fall into your arms again 
 God, my life I shall not roam 
 Lead me where your waters run 
 You, yourself and nothing less 
 All my life I'll fight to rest 
 Speak light in my darkness 
 Speak life till I know 
 There's strength for my weakness 
 Slow down oh my soul 
 Slow down my soul 
 You are where my soul finds rest 
 You are where I lay my head 
 Your grace lets me catch my breath 
 Lets me fall into your arms again 
 Tell me your love will never fail me 
 I'm safe here in your mercy 
 You're keeping me alive 
 I need to feel your peace within me 
 Calm the fears that haunt me 
 Clear away the lies 
 Tell me your love is in my bloodstream 
 It's burning up my heartbeat 
 Bringing me your light 
 You are where my soul finds rest 
 You are where I lay my head 
 Your grace lets me catch my breath 
 Lets me fall into your arms again 
 Again

There's a wreckage, there's a fire 
 There's a weakness in my love 
 There's a hunger I can't control 
 Lord I falter and I fall down 
 Then I hold on to the chains you broke 
 When You came down and saved my soul 
 Save my soul 
 Hallelujah 
 We are free to struggle 
 We're not struggling to be free 
 Your blood bought and makes us children 
 So children drop your chains and sing 
 So I look, do I still fail 
 Do I withhold, do I still give into temptation 
 On my own I am bankrupt 
 I will trust You, I'll take you at your word 
 You promise 
 Hallelujah 
 We are free to struggle 
 We're not struggling to be free 
 Your blood bought and makes us children 
 So children drop your chains and sing 
 Hallelujah, death is overcome 
 And we are breathing 
 Hallelujah our stone hearts become flesh 
 A flesh that's beating 
 Hallelujah chains have been undone 
 And we are singing 
 Hallelujah the fire has begun 
 Can you feel it? 
 Hallelujah, death is overcome 
 And we are breathing 
 Hallelujah our stone hearts become flesh 
 A flesh that's beating 
 Hallelujah chains have been undone 
 And we are singing 
 Hallelujah the fire has begun 
 Can you feel it? 
 Hallelujah 
 We are free to struggle 
 We're not struggling to be free 
 Your blood bought and makes us children 
 So children drop your chains and sing 
 (Ooh's)

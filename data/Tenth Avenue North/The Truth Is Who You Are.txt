It would be easier if you were just a thought in my head 
 Simply something that I once read 
 A belief needing my defense 
 And it would be easier if you were something I once knew 
 A hope just to hold on to 
 But you're holding out your hands 
 You came to take us back to the start 
 You came to touch the hardness of our hearts 
 You gave us truth that truth is who You are 
 It's who You are 
 And it’s not enough to just say, "I believe." 
 ‘Cause truth is that talk is cheap 
 So grace give me eyes to see 
 That You came to take us back to the start 
 You came to touch the hardness of our hearts 
 You gave us truth that truth is who You are 
 It's who You are 
 Flesh and blood You offer us 
 Oh, to eat the bread and drink the cup 
 Oh, to taste, to see, to feel, to touch 
 Emmanuel, God with us 
 Emmanuel, God with us 
 ‘Cause You came to break the chains apart 
 To wake the dead and the sleeping of our hearts 
 You gave us truth that truth is who You are 
 It's who You are 
 It's who You are

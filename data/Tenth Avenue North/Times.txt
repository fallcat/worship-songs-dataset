I know I need You 
 I need to love You 
 I'd love to see You but it's been so long 
 I long to feel You 
 I feel this need for You 
 I need to hear You 
 Is that so wrong 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 Now You pull me near You 
 When we're close I fear You 
 Still I'm afraid to tell you all that I've done 
 Are You done forgiving 
 Or can You look past my pretending, Lord 
 I'm so tired of defending what I've become 
 What have I become 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 I hear You say 
 My love is over 
 It's underneath 
 It's inside 
 It's in between 
 The times that you doubt me 
 When you can't feel 
 The times that you question 
 Is this for real 
 The times you're broken 
 The times that you mend 
 The times you hate me 
 And the times that you bend 
 Well my love is over 
 It's underneath 
 It's inside 
 It's in between 
 The times that you're healing 
 And when your heart breaks 
 The times that you feel like you've fallen from grace 
 The times you're hurting 
 The times that you heal 
 The times you go hungry and are tempted to steal 
 In times of confusion 
 In chaos and pain 
 I'm there in your sorrow under the weight of your shame 
 I'm there through your heart-ache 
 I'm there in the storm 
 My love I will keep you by my power alone 
 I don't care where you've fallen or where you have been 
 I'll never forsake you 
 My love never ends 
 It never ends, mmmm 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh 
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

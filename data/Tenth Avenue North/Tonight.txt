Calling out, Your voice like thunder 
 Split my soul like the sky in summer 
 Rains that fall to wash my tears aside 
 Dance of light, flash of wonder 
 Heaven's storms with love and water 
 Oceans roar at Your changing tide 
 Tonight I'll be all right 
 I'll be all right 
 Tonight I'll be all right 
 I'll be all right 
 Tonight I'll be all right 
 All right, I'll be all right 
 Tonight I'll be all right

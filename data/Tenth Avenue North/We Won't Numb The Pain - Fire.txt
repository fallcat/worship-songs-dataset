We're taking paths of least resistance 
 And never feel our soul's persistence 
 Turn on the radio 
 We don't wanna know 
 Keep on running in cruise control 
 We were never meant to live like this 
 So much has happened and too easy to miss, yeah 
 Cheap thrills, social media thrills, use sex like a drug and we can't keep still 
 Distracted, distracted 
 Keep ourselves so distracted 
 We want more 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Hands reaching to the sky 
 Hearts ready for the fire 
 Eyes open till we die 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Slow down inside the riot 
 Stand still against the tide 
 Keep fighting for the silence 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Talk influence and being strategic 
 But all I'm feeling is narcissistic 
 Use recognition for the adrenaline 
 Don't stop long enough to hear the disconnection 
 We were never meant to live like this 
 Stand up for anything and be dismissed 
 We don't want it real, we keep it trivial 
 Objectify it gives a greater feel 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Hands reaching to the sky 
 Hearts ready for the fire 
 Eyes open till we die 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Slow down inside the riot 
 Stand still against the tide 
 Keep fighting for the silence 
 We won't numb the pain 
 We want the cure, not a medication 
 We're gonna deal with it now 
 We want the cure, not a medication 
 We're gonna deal with it now 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Hands reaching to the sky 
 Hearts ready for the fire 
 Eyes open till we die 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Slow down inside the riot 
 Stand still against the tide 
 Keep fighting for the silence 
 We won't numb the pain 
 Gonna feel my, 
 Gonna feel my, 
 Gonna feel my heart now 
 Let me get a taste of your sweetness 
 Give me one glimpse of your lovely light 
 Lord, be my joy and treasure 
 My delight 
 Let me have a sense of your presence 
 May I trust your mercy all my life 
 I just wanna be a fire burning in the night 
 Fire, fire, fire, fire 
 Fire in my heart, fire in my soul 
 May the fire of your love burn away control 
 Satisfy my heart, 'cause I don't wanna steal 
 Or give in to my lust just to feel 
 Fire, fire, fire, fire

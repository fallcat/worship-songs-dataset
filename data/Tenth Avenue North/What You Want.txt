Everyday I've been feeling the pressure 
 I always gotta know the plan 
 It's a weight that I've tried to shoulder 
 I thought I could, but I can't 
 And I'm so tired of chasing dreams 
 When I am wired to let you lead 
 You're changing my heart 
 To want what you want 
 To love how you love 
 And that is enough 
 There's no greater plan that I need to know 
 You only ask me to follow 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 Oh I'm feelin' this surrender 
 I feel myself come alive 
 And the burden feels like a feather 
 When I let my agenda die 
 And I get so tired of my own dreams 
 But I am wired to let you lead 
 You're changing my heart 
 To want what you want 
 To love how you love 
 And that is enough 
 There's no greater plan that I need to know 
 You only ask me to follow 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 So many leaders, you ask for followers 
 So keep on leading, cuz you're my father 
 So many leaders, you ask for followers 
 So keep on leading, cuz you're my father 
 You're changing my heart 
 To want what you want 
 To love how you love 
 And that is enough 
 There's no greater plan that I need to know 
 You only ask me to follow 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you, what you want 
 And want what you 
 So many leaders (what you want), you ask for followers 
 So keep on leading (what you want), cuz you're my father 
 So many leaders (what you want), you ask for followers 
 So keep on leading (what you want), cuz you're my father

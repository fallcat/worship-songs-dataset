I'm waking up again 
 In this land of shadows 
 My eyes are growing dim 
 Lured toward the gallows 
 So light my soul ablaze 
 A field on fire 
 Take me to that place 
 Of one desire 
 O, tempted heart 
 Come alive 
 I feel you burning inside 
 Weary soul, lift up your eyes 
 To a city 
 Where life will never die 
 But the dark and immediate 
 They come so easy 
 So I keep on giving in 
 To the things that kill me 
 O, tempted heart 
 Come alive 
 I feel you burning inside 
 Weary soul, lift up your eyes 
 To a city 
 Where life will never die 
 This rusted world 
 Can't satisfy 
 There's nothing here that will survive 
 The night will end 
 The sun will rise 
 On a city 
 Where life will never die 
 Dark eyes look up 
 See your kingdom come 
 Burn within our lungs 
 Further up 
 Further on 
 Higher 
 Take me higher 
 O, tempted heart 
 Come alive 
 I feel you burning inside 
 Weary soul, lift up your eyes 
 To a city 
 Where life will never die 
 This rusted world 
 Can't satisfy 
 There's nothing here that will survive 
 The night will end 
 The sun will rise 
 On the city where life will never die

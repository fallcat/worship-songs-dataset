I'm tired, I'm worn 
 My heart is heavy 
 From the work it takes to keep on breathing 
 I've made mistakes 
 I've let my hope fail 
 My soul feels crushed by the weight of this world 
 And I know that you can give me rest 
 So I cry out with all that I have left 
 Let me see redemption win 
 Let me know the struggle ends 
 That you can mend a heart that's frail and torn 
 I wanna know the sun can rise from the ashes of a broken life 
 And all that's dead inside can be reborn 
 'Cause I'm worn 
 I know I need to lift my eyes up 
 But I'm too weak 
 Life just won't let up 
 And I know that you can give me rest 
 So I cry out with all that I have left 
 Let me see redemption win 
 Let me know the struggle ends 
 That you can mend a heart that's frail and torn 
 I wanna know the sun can rise from the ashes of a broken life 
 And all that's dead inside can be reborn 
 'Cause I'm worn 
 My prayers are wearing thin 
 And I'm worn 
 Even before the day begins 
 I'm worn 
 I've lost my will to fight 
 I'm worn 
 Heaven come and flood my eyes 
 Let me see redemption win 
 Let me know the struggle ends 
 That you can mend a heart that's frail and torn 
 I wanna know the sun can rise from the ashes of a broken life 
 And all that's dead inside can be reborn 
 Cause all that's dead inside will be reborn 
 Though I'm worn 
 Yeah I'm worn

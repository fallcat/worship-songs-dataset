There's a girl in the corner with tear stains on her eyes 
 From the places she's wandered and the shame she can't hide 
 She says, "How did I get here? I'm not who I once was, 
 and I'm crippled by the fear that I've fallen too far to love." 
 But don't you know who you are 
 What has been done for you 
 Don't you know who you are 
 You are more than the choices that you've made 
 You are more than the sum of your past mistakes 
 You are more than the problems you create 
 You've been remade 
 Well she tries to believe it that she's been given new life 
 But she can't shake the feeling that it’s not true tonight 
 She knows all the answers and she's rehearsed all the lines 
 So she'll try to do better but then she's too weak to try 
 But don't you know who you are 
 You are more than the choices that you've made 
 You are more than the sum of your past mistakes 
 You are more than the problems you create 
 You've been remade 
 ‘Cause this is not about what you've done 
 But what's been done for you 
 This is not about where you've been 
 But where your brokenness brings you to 
 This is not about what you feel but what He felt to forgive you 
 And what He felt to make you loved 
 You are more than the choices that you've made 
 You are more than the sum of your past mistakes 
 You are more than the problems you create 
 You've been remade 
 You've been remade

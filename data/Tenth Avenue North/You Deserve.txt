You put a song in my mouth 
 A Hymn of praise to you 
 Many are your wonders 
 Who is there like you? 
 All my heart and all my love 
 And all my life you deserve 
 Your beauty lies within my heart 
 Your glory I can see 
 And so I sing 
 And lift my hands to you 
 I stand upon your matchless love 
 I stand upon your truth 
 And so I sing 
 And lift my heart to you 
 You're more 
 Than all I've ever dreamed of 
 You're everything I'll ever need 
 I stand amazed at all your beauty 
 Oh God you deserve, 
 Oh God you deserve, 
 Oh God you deserve all of me.

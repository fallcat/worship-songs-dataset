Father in heaven, hear this simple prayer 
 Get us through the night and fill up our despair 
 Pain has come, taught us to fear 
 We're gonna need some grace, God 
 To fill the air 
 Cause in the twilight 
 We need eyes to see 
 How You're working beauty 
 Even out of ugly things 
 You do all things 
 You do all things 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things 
 You do all things 
 You do all things well 
 Yeah 
 Father among us 
 Keep us in your arms 
 There's evil all around us 
 And we're trying to hold on 
 Just to know 
 That You're still good 
 That Your love is alive 
 Oh, let's cling to Jesus 
 And sing tonight 
 You do all things 
 You do all things 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things 
 You do all things 
 You do all things well 
 You break me to bind me 
 You hurt me, lord, to heal me 
 You cut me to touch me 
 You died to revive me 
 You break me to bind me 
 You hurt me, lord, to heal me 
 You cut me to touch me 
 You died to revive me 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 You do all things 
 You do all things 
 You do all things well 
 You do all things 
 You do all things 
 You do all things well

This current is trying to wreck me 
 Like castles of sand, castles of sand 
 My fear, like an enemy army 
 Is marching again, but I'm making a stand 
 You surround me on every side 
 Your love is my armor I fear no evil 
 Darkness runs from your light 
 So I won't be afraid, I won't be afraid 
 You're going before me 
 And oceans are parting 
 You're fighting my battles 
 When my feet are failing 
 And my heart is shaking 
 You're fighting my battles 
 Fighting my battles 
 Time after time you're my refuge 
 You heal every scar you're guarding my heart 
 Your promise, the hope that I cling to 
 My rescue, my friend you come rushing in 
 And surround me on every side 
 Your love is my armor I fear no evil 
 Darkness runs from your light 
 So I won't be afraid, I won't be afraid 
 You're going before me 
 And oceans are parting 
 You're fighting my battles 
 When my feet are failing 
 And my heart is shaking 
 You're fighting my battles 
 Fighting my battles 
 In my weakness you are strong 
 Every trouble you have overcome 
 In my weakness you are strong 
 Every trouble you have overcome 
 In my weakness you are strong 
 Every trouble you have overcome 
 You have overcome 
 You're going before me 
 And oceans are parting 
 You're fighting my battles 
 When my feet are failing 
 And my heart is shaking 
 You're fighting my battles 
 Fighting my battles

Far away, I feel your beating heart 
 All alone, beneath the crystal stars 
 Staring into space, what a lonely face 
 I'll try to find my place with you 
 What a Beautiful smile 
 Can I stay for a while 
 On this beautiful night 
 We'll make everything right 
 My beautiful love 
 Larger than the moon, my love for you 
 Worlds collide, as heaven pulls us through 
 The secret of the world is written in the stars 
 I'm carrying your heart in mine 
 What a Beautiful smile 
 Can I stay for a while 
 On this beautiful night 
 We'll make everything right 
 My beautiful love 
 Maybe a greater thing will happen 
 Maybe all will see 
 Maybe our love will catch like fire 
 As it burns through me 
 What a Beautiful smile 
 Can I stay for a while 
 On this beautiful night 
 We'll make everything all right 
 My Beautiful love

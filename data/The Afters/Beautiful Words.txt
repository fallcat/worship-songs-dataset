Slow down 
 This is such a blur 
 Tell me what's the hurry now 
 Have we been running round in circles 
 Missing all that we could be 
 You say it's not too late 
 We are words 
 On pages that we've left unturned 
 An ending no one's ever heard 
 We are a story slowly unfolding 
 Beautiful words 
 I could walk across the ocean 
 With you walking next to me 
 And you could melt away this winter 
 Now we're starting over 
 We will see it's not too late 
 That last when everything else has passed 
 Even when the stars are gone 
 I know every single beautiful word that we were will live on

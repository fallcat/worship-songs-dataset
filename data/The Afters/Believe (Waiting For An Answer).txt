Walking through the halls of a desperate place 
 I see it on the faces 
 All the mothers all the fathers searching for some faith 
 Here I am 
 I'm one of them 
 My world inside a broken frame 
 Still waiting for an answer 
 Every day I'm getting closer 
 The more it hurts the more I need of you 
 The more I search the more I see of you 
 I don't have to know how 
 Or see you turn this around 
 To believe in You 
 To believe in You 
 Walking through the streets that money built 
 Every castle has a hill 
 All the dreams, all the chasers 
 Cages waiting to be filled 
 Here I am one of them 
 Can I be stronger than my will 
 I'm still waiting for an answer 
 Every day I'm getting closer 
 The tears we cry from all the pain 
 You won't let them go to waste 
 An aching heart will know your face 
 Through every night, through every fear 
 You're by my side 
 I know you're here 
 And in this life 
 I'm not alone

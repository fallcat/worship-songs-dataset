It's a brand new day 
 Something inside me has been changed 
 Yesterday is gone 
 So is the man I used to be 
 Now I'll be moving on 
 Now I'll be moving on 
 Today I woke up to a brand new day 
 Today I woke up to a brand new day 
 Maybe I'm asleep 
 Maybe these are thoughts inside my head 
 But if it's a dream 
 I am never getting out of bed 
 And now I'll be moving on 
 I'm finally moving on

I always think tomorrow will be better 
 That there will come a day when I arrive 
 That the list of everything I've got to do 
 Will be a page of empty lines 
 I apologize 
 To myself for living in the future 
 And letting what's ahead get in the way 
 Because if happiness is always down the road 
 Then I'm missing it today 
 Breathe in, Breathe out 
 Slow down, slow down 
 Everybody look around 
 Life is where we are now 
 Breathe in, Breathe out 
 Well I don't need no money to be wealthy 
 There's more to life than working for the green 
 Climbing all these ladders doesn't matter 
 I've got everything I need 
 I'm running a race that no one wins 
 And setting the pace for the Joneses 
 But I see the warning signs 
 Those yellow flashing lights 
 And I wonder why

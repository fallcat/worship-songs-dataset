I can barely stand right now 
 Everything is crashing down, 
 And I wonder where You are 
 I try to find the words to pray 
 I don't always know what to say, 
 But You're the one who can hear my heart 
 Even though I don't know what your plan is, 
 I know You're making beauty from these ashes 
 I've seen joy and I've seen pain 
 On my knees, I call Your name 
 Here's my broken hallelujah 
 With nothing left to hold onto, 
 I raise these empty hands to You 
 Here's my broken hallelujah 
 You know the things that have brought me here 
 You know the story of every tear 
 Cause You've been here from the very start 
 Even though I don't know what your plan is, 
 I know You're making beauty from these ashes 
 When all is taken away, don't let my heart be changed 
 Let me always sing Hallelujah 
 When I feel afraid, don't let my hope be erased 
 Let me always sing Hallelujah

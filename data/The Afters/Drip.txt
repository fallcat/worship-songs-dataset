Drip by drip the water leaks the noise it makes is how it speaks 
 The words it says are "time goes on" The life it lives is never done 
 A drip is like a day in life sometimes they come and pass you byand 
 No one knows from where they came or what they're for or what's their names 
 One drip kept dry throats from parching One drip saw the red sea parting 
 One drip rolled down Jesus face Before he died to take my place 
 A drip of water isn't much So insignicant are such 
 But every time a drip I see my Savior dying on a tree

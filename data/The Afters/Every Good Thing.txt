I tend to be 
 Busier than I should be 
 I tend to think time is gonna wait for me 
 Sometimes I forget and take for granted that it's a beautiful life we live 
 I don't wanna miss the moments like this 
 This is a beautiful life You give 
 You're the reason for 
 Every good thing 
 Every heartbeat 
 Every day we get to breathe 
 You're the reason for 
 Anything that lasts 
 Every second chance 
 Every laugh 
 Life is so sweet 
 You're the reason for every good thing 
 There will be days 
 That give me more than I can take 
 But I know that You always make 
 Beauty from my heartache 
 I don't wanna forget, or take for granted 
 That it's a beautiful life we live. 
 I'm not gonna miss the moments like this 
 This is a beautiful life You give 
 It's our family 
 It's our friends 
 It's feeling that I get when you see my children smile 
 This life 
 Everything we love 
 It's You alive in us 
 You're alive in us 
 You're the reason for 
 Every good thing 
 Every heartbeat 
 Every day we get to breath 
 You're the reason for 
 Anything that lasts 
 Every second chance 
 Every laugh 
 Life is so sweet 
 You're the reason for every good thing 
 You are 
 You are here in every moment 
 And I know that You're every good thing.

Wide awake, every minute feeling like a day 
 And you wonder if you're gonna have the strength it takes 
 Can you bend and never break 
 If you're afraid and your fear is standing in the way 
 And all you wanna do is turn and run away 
 But don't forget that you are brave 
 So put your gloves on and pull out the fighter 
 Never let anyone put out your fire 
 Cause anything's possible 
 With God by your side 
 You're standing strong though it all 
 As mountains crumble and fall 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 Whatever battle may come 
 You know He's already won 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 Holding on, to faith inside you, growing strong 
 Knowing it's the only way you'll make it through 
 Everything you got in front of you 
 So put your gloves on and pull out the fighter 
 Never let anyone put out your fire 
 Cause anything's possible 
 With God by your side 
 You're standing strong though it all 
 As mountains crumble and fall 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 Whatever battle may come 
 You know He's already won 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 Anything is possible 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 Anything is possible 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 So put your gloves on and pull out the fighter 
 Never let anyone put out your fire 
 Never let anyone put out your fire 
 So put your gloves on and pull out the fighter 
 Never let anyone put out your fire 
 You're the one, you're the one 
 With the eyes of a believer 
 You're standing strong though it all 
 As mountains crumble and fall 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 Whatever battle may come 
 You know He's already won 
 (In the eyes) In the eyes of a believer 
 The one who made the stars 
 Is standing where you are 
 Never let anyone put out your fire 
 The one who made you strong 
 Has overcome it all 
 In the eyes of a believer 
 Anything is possible 
 In the eyes of a believer

It was raining on the sun 
 The ground beneath my feet was crumbling 
 Day and Night had come undone 
 It was the season of my wandering 
 Somehow Somewhere 
 You found me there 
 It was the moment that it all became clear 
 I was on the edge 
 Of a distant world 
 A shattered life 
 With no where left to turn 
 Till I saw you there 
 And everything I thought had gone to waste 
 Was falling into place 
 It's finally quiet in my head 
 As I lay the pieces at your feet 
 It's finally starting to make sense 
 I guess I found the missing part of me 
 Oceans that I almost drowned in 
 I had to lose it all 
 Just so I could find out you were there to break my fall

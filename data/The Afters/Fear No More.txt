Every anxious thought that steals my breath 
 It's a heavy weight upon my chest 
 As I lie awake and wonder what the future will hold 
 Help me to remember that You're in control 
 You're my courage when I worry in the dead of night 
 You're my strength 'cause I'm not strong enough to win this fight 
 You are greater than the battle raging in my mind 
 I will trust You, Lord, I will fear no more 
 I will lift my eyes, I will lift my cares 
 Lay them in Your hands, I'll leave them there 
 When the wind and waves are coming, You shelter me 
 Even though I'm in the storm, the storm is not in me 
 You're my courage when I worry in the dead of night 
 You're my strength 'cause I'm not strong enough to win this fight 
 You are greater than the battle raging in my mind 
 I will trust You, Lord, I will fear no more 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I will fear no more 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I will fear no more 
 No power can come against me 'cause You have overcome 
 No darkness can overwhelm me 'cause You've already won 
 No power can come against me 'cause You have overcome 
 No darkness can overwhelm me 'cause You've already won 
 You're my courage when I worry in the dead of night 
 You're my strength 'cause I'm not strong enough to win this fight 
 You are greater than the battle raging in my mind 
 I will trust You, Lord (Trust You, Lord) 
 I will fear no more (Fear no more) 
 I will fear no more (Fear no more) 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I will fear no more 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I will fear no more 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I will fear no more

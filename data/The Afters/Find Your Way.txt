Don't believe 
 The bridge from you to me 
 Could somehow ever be washed away 
 Don't give in 
 Don't start listening 
 To voices whispering things I'd never say 
 There is nothing you could do to make me turn my back on you 
 You're never to lost to know where the road is 
 It could be dark 
 You could be hopeless 
 But, I'll wait till you find your way 
 You're never to far to be forgotten 
 Here in my heart, I hear you calling 
 So I'll wait till you find your way back home 
 The hardest part is to just sit waiting 
 My heart breaking for you 
 I stare at the space 
 Where I save your place 
 Knowing that someday I'll look at you 
 With my heart still hoping 
 And my arms wide open, 
 I'll never give up this fight 
 I know we'll talk like we used to, 
 And we'll walk like we used to 
 It's just a matter of time 
 There is nothing you could do to make me turn my back on you 
 You're never to lost to know where the road is 
 It could be dark 
 You could be hopeless 
 But, I'll wait till you find your way 
 You're never to far to be forgotten 
 Here in my heart, I hear you calling 
 So I'll wait for as long as it takes 
 I'll wait till you find your way back home

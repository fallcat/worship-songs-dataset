I've been here for so long 
 I can't be too far from You 
 I feel You in my heart 
 But I can't see You in my fears 
 And I know it's hard to pray 
 When I have nothing but bad things to say 
 And so I try to find a way to follow You 
 Help me find my way I've gone astray 
 I fell into my ways, don't turn away 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 And I cry for a little, complain a lot 
 And I wait for the moment when I'll just wake up 
 It seems that I've been living a simple dream 
 And I wait for the time when I can go away 
 I'm weak but I feel strong 
 I feel love but I'm not kind 
 I'm foolish in my ways 
 I wish I'd be a bit more wise 
 And I know it's hard to pray 
 When I have nothing but bad things to say 
 And so I try to find a way to follow You 
 Help me find my way I've gone astray 
 I fell into my ways, don't turn away 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 And I cry for a little, complain a lot 
 And I wait for the moment when I'll just wake up 
 It seems that I've been living a simple dream 
 And I wait for the time when I can go away 
 I'm calling out Your name 
 Hear my prayer 
 Hold my hand 
 'Cause I can feel Your arms around me 
 I can feel Your love surround me 
 Hold me Jesus, make me feel so free

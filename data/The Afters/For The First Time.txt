There's a different sunrise 
 It's a different world 
 In a way I feel like 
 I have just begun 
 Like I don't remember 
 Waking up from a dream 
 All my chains are broken 
 And I feel so free 
 I can breathe for the first time 
 I can see for the first time 
 It's like you opened my eyes 
 I can feel my heart is coming alive, I feel alive 
 I can breathe for the first time 
 For the first time, for the first time 
 For the first time, for the first time 
 Once a life imprisoned 
 I was locked in the past 
 But your love has given 
 Given one more chance 
 Once my light was fading 
 But you gave me yours 
 Now my world is brighter 
 Than it was before 
 I can breathe for the first time 
 I can see for the first time 
 It's like you opened my eyes 
 I can feel my heart is coming alive, I feel alive 
 I can breathe for the first time 
 For the first time, for the first time 
 For the first time, for the first time 
 And I've never run so far 
 I've never felt so strong 
 When I am where you are 
 I've found where I belong 
 For the first time, for the first time 
 I can breathe for the first time 
 I can see for the first time 
 It's like you opened my eyes 
 I can feel my heart is coming alive, I feel alive 
 I can breathe for the first time 
 For the first time, for the first time 
 For the first time, for the first time

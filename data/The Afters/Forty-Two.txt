I came into this world to find a reason to live 
 I came with nothing to give 
 Nothing I could offer, nothing I could ever do 
 Before you set the stars up in the sky 
 You came and took me aside 
 You told me I was part of the plan 
 You told me I was yours 
 Will you tell me what this life is all about 
 Will you show me how to make my time here count 
 Will lead the way on, to the other side 
 Because I want to feel alive 
 If I could only see right to the end 
 I'd know just where to begin 
 I could put together all the little pieces 
 You carry the world, You hold it in your hands 
 It's all a part of your plan 
 Show me how to love, won't you help me find my way to you 
 Will you tell me what this life is all about 
 Will you show me how to make my time here count 
 Will lead the way on, to the other side 
 Because I want to feel alive 
 There's a place for us 
 The perfect place for us

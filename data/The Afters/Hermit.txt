Just hold my hand, I won't let go 
 And I'll be your friend until the end 
 And if love can hurt, please don't hurt me 
 Yellow tea, is not for me 
 Yellow tea, is not for me 
 Your leaving me in a fantasy world 
 You're like a child in your own little world 
 Your leaving me in a fantasy world 
 It's okay, it's all right

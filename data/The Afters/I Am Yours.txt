I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I could walk across the world 
 And never find the answer 
 I could search the sky above 
 And never get any closer 
 You made it all 
 And I am left to fall at the feet 
 Of the One who fell for me 
 You gave Your life for mine 
 To have me by Your side 
 I won't look back anymore 
 Now that I, I am Yours 
 You'll never say goodbye 
 You are the reason why 
 I won't look back anymore 
 Now that I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 All the rest can disappear 
 Without any traces 
 I have nothing left to fear 
 As long as Your face is 
 All I can see 
 You are all I need 
 Every breath, every step 
 You're here with me 
 You gave Your life for mine 
 To have me by Your side 
 I won't look back anymore 
 Now that I, I am Yours 
 You'll never say goodbye 
 You are the reason why 
 I won't look back anymore 
 Now that I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I belong to You 
 You and You alone 
 I belong to You 
 You and You alone 
 I belong to You 
 You and You alone 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 You're here with me 
 You gave Your life for mine 
 To have me by Your side 
 I won't look back anymore 
 Now that I, I am Yours 
 You'll never say goodbye 
 You are the reason why 
 I won't look back anymore 
 Now that I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 (Now that I) 
 I, I am Yours 
 I, I am Yours 
 (Now that I) 
 I, I am Yours 
 I can walk across the world 
 I could search the sky above 
 You made it all 
 Hence I am Yours

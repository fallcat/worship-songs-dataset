I want you back, I want you back 
 You want me too, I know it's true 
 Your love for me won't let me be 
 And it's calling me, drawing me, 
 Dragging me back to you 
 I can't run away 
 If I go to the bottom of the ocean You are there 
 Nowhere to escape, a rocket ship to outer space 
 Won't take me away from the love that you gave 
 When you saved me, saved me, saved me, yeah 
 I've tried and I've tried 
 To deny what I feel inside 
 It's like I'm dying 
 I can't understand, why there's a part of me 
 That you hold in your hands 
 Help me understand 
 Why there's a promise that's pure 
 And a love that endures 
 When I'm falling, falling, calling out your name 
 In the night, and I'm blinded with pride 
 I've got to keep on trying 
 Your voice is screamin' so loud 
 I can't take it anymore, I swear 
 I'll turn right around and I'll run to your arms 
 That's where I will belong

You're walking 
 But no one seems to notice 
 Like a picture out of focus 
 But it looks clear to me 
 You're talking 
 Feels like no one's listening 
 You think you're not interesting 
 But I just don't agree 
 You're the color showing through 
 A world of black and white 
 I will always stand by you 
 'Cause I am on your side 
 In my eyes 
 You're more than complete 
 You're perfect to me 
 If you could only see the way that you shine 
 In my eyes 
 If there's one thing that's true 
 It's that I believe in you 
 You make the world look so bright and put a smile in my eyes 
 Do you see the sky is smiling? 
 There's no need for hiding 
 You're all I want to see 
 I could spend a lifetime trying 
 To find the words describing 
 What you are to me 
 You're the color showing through 
 A world of black and white 
 I will always stand by you 
 'Cause I am on your side 
 When all you see are the scars 
 All I see is your heart 
 You're beautiful 
 You're beautiful the way that you are

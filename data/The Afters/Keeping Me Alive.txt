It's like I've never lived 
 Before my life with you 
 So much was missing here 
 I never even knew 
 I still picture 
 The place we were 
 When I fell into 
 Your world 
 My heart is in you 
 Where you go you carry me 
 I bleed if you bleed 
 Your heart beats inside of me 
 You're keeping me alive 
 I don't know why I feel this way 
 But something's right 
 You're like the morning air 
 Before the light arives 
 No more lonely 
 And no more night 
 No more secrets 
 To hide 
 My heart is in you 
 Where you go you carry me 
 I bleed if you bleed 
 Your heart beats inside of me 
 You're keeping me alive 
 I'll hold you near 
 Together we'll never die 
 Your love is keeping me alive (Your love is keeping me alive) 
 Your love is keeping me alive (Your love is keeping me alive) 
 My heart is in you 
 Where you go you carry me 
 I bleed if you bleed 
 Your heart beats inside of me 
 You're keeping me alive 
 Your keeping me alive

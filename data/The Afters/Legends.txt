I hear the roar of resistance 
 It's vibrating through my bones 
 I'm breathing in my existence 
 It's waking up my soul 
 Don't run for cover 
 When the sky above is torn 
 Is there any wonder 
 What we fight these battles for 
 That's where legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 Caught in the cross fire 
 Stand up to empires 
 Waging a war 
 That's where legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 Kingdoms hang in the balance 
 As walls break down in to stones 
 And heroes rise from the shadows 
 Even if they fight alone 
 That's where legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 Caught in the cross fire 
 Stand up to empires 
 Waging a war 
 That's where legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 When it's on the line 
 That's when we come alive 
 Legends, legends 
 Legends, legends 
 When it's on the line 
 That's when we come alive 
 Legends, legends 
 Legends, legends 
 That's where legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 Legends are born 
 Caught in the cross fire 
 Stand up to empires 
 Waging a war 
 That's where legends are born 
 When it's on the line 
 That's when we come alive 
 Legends are born 
 When it's on the line 
 That's when we come alive

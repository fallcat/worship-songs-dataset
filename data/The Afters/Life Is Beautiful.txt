Through the window 
 I see you waiting 
 You are smiling 
 'Cause I'm coming 
 Your eyes are a story 
 An ocean of memories 
 Pictures of faces and places 
 And all of the things 
 That make us feel like we have it all 
 All of the times 
 That make us realize 
 We have it all 
 Life is beautiful 
 Living and dying 
 Laughing or crying 
 If we have the whole world or have nothing 
 I know there are long nights 
 But we'll make it 
 With every sunrise comes a new light 
 And all of the things 
 That make us feel like we have it all 
 All of the times 
 That make us realize 
 We have it all 
 Life is beautiful 
 A father's love 
 A wedding dance 
 New Year's dreams 
 A toast with friends 
 A soldier coming home from war 
 The faith, the hope of so much more 
 A brand new life 
 A mother's prayer 
 Shooting stars 
 Ocean air 
 A lover's kiss 
 And hard goodbyes 
 Fireworks 
 Christmas lights 
 These are things that make us feel alive 
 These are the times that make us realize 
 Life is beautiful

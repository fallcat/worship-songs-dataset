My heart is giving up 
 All my plans are broken 
 Your face is all I see 
 Though my world is fallen 
 As I watched You head into the sun 
 I never thought it was 
 My one chance to say goodbye 
 I never want to say goodbye 
 Life is sweeter, sweeter 
 On the other side, on the other side 
 I will see you, see You 
 On the other side, on the other side 
 I'll fight the stars to let me through 
 I'll find a way to get to You 
 Life is sweeter 
 On the other side of here 
 So far from where you are 
 But I feel You with me 
 You're in the place where I belong 
 Where my life is waiting 
 As I watch the rising of the sun 
 I pray that I could just have 
 One chance to say goodnight 
 I never wanna say goodbye 
 Life is sweeter, sweeter 
 On the other side, on the other side 
 I will see You, see You 
 On the other side, on the other side 
 I'll fight the stars to let me through 
 I'll find a way to get to You 
 Life is sweeter 
 On the other side of here 
 Everyday, I get a little bit closer to reaching You 
 But I can't wait until I'm with You forever 
 Everyday, I get a little bit closer to reaching You 
 But I can't wait until I hold You forever 
 Life is sweeter, sweeter 
 On the other side, on the other side 
 I will see You, see You 
 On the other side, on the other side 
 I'll fight the stars to let me through 
 I'll find a way to get to You 
 Life is sweeter 
 On the other side of here 
 On the other side of here

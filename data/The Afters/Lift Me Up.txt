You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up 
 Waiting for the sunrise 
 Waiting for the day 
 Waiting for a sign that I'm 
 Where You want me to be 
 You know my heart is heavy 
 And the hurt is deep 
 But when I feel like giving up 
 You're reminding me 
 That we all fall down sometimes 
 When I hit the ground 
 You lift me up when I am weak 
 Your arms wrap around me 
 Your love catches me so I'm letting go 
 You lift me up when I can't see 
 You heart's all that I need 
 Your love carries me so I'm letting go 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up 
 I know I'm not perfect 
 I know I make mistakes 
 I know that I have let You down 
 But You love me the same 
 And when I'm surrounded 
 And when I lose my way 
 And when I'm crying out and fallen down 
 You are here to lift me up when I am weak 
 Your arms wrap around me 
 Your love catches me so I'm letting go 
 You lift me up when I can't see 
 You heart's all that I need 
 Your love carries me so I'm letting go 
 I can see the dawn is breaking 
 I am feeling overtaken 
 With Your love, with Your love 
 I don't know what I can offer 
 In this moment, I surrender 
 To Your love, to Your love 
 You lift me up when I am weak 
 Your arms wrap around me 
 Your love catches me so I'm letting go 
 You lift me up when I am weak 
 Your arms wrap around me 
 Your love catches me so I'm letting go 
 You lift me up when I can't see 
 You heart's all that I need 
 Your love carries me so I'm letting go 
 I can see the dawn is breaking 
 I am feeling overtaken 
 With Your love, with Your love 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up with Your love 
 You lift me up

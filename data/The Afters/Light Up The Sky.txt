When I'm feeling all alone 
 With so far to go 
 The signs are no where on this road 
 Guiding me home 
 When the night is closing in 
 Is falling on my skin 
 Oh God will You come close? 
 Light light light up the sky 
 You light up the sky to show me You are with me 
 I I I can't deny 
 No I can't deny that You are right here with me 
 You've opened my eyes 
 So I can see You all around me 
 Light light light up the sky 
 You light up the sky to show me 
 That You are with me 
 When stars are hiding in the clouds 
 I don't feel them shining 
 When I can't see You beyond my doubt 
 The silver lining 
 When I've almost reached the end 
 Like a flood You're rushing in 
 Your love is rushing in 
 So I run straight into Your arms 
 You're the bright and morning sun 
 To show Your love there's nothing You won't do 
 That You are with me 
 That You are with me

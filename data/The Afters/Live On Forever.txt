Dark days are gonna go away 
 They won't have the final say 
 These bones were always gonna fade 
 'Cause we were made for another place 
 The moment of our final breath 
 When all our fears are put to rest 
 Every tear will disappear 
 Heaven is real 
 We're gonna live on forever 
 Forever 
 Forever 
 We're gonna live on forever 
 Forever 
 Forever 
 We are not where we belong 
 We have hope 
 We're gonna live on 
 Forever 
 Forever 
 Forever 
 Breathing air we have never breathed 
 We'll see colors we've never seen 
 Every sound like a symphony 
 Rising up as the angels sing 
 The arms of grace are open wide 
 The face of love before our eyes 
 Where every tear will disappear 
 Heaven is real 
 Our hearts have been set in motion 
 For something more, for something more 
 Than we could ever imagine 
 There's so much more, there's so much more

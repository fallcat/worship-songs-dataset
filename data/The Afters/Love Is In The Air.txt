Here, under the bright lights 
 No one around 
 It's only you and me 
 Here, until the sunrise 
 I wanna stay with you and never leave 
 The world's slowing down 
 My heart's speeding up 
 I know it might seem crazy 
 I look into your eyes 
 Lighting up the night 
 When you are with me 
 Love is in the air tonight 
 Love is everywhere tonight 
 Moving through my heart like the wind 
 I come alive as I breathe it in 
 Love is in the air 
 Love is in the air tonight 
 Here, we're feeling weightless 
 As we escape gravity 
 Where will this take us? 
 Imagine all that we can be 
 The world's slowing down 
 My heart's speeding up 
 I know it might seem crazy 
 I look into your eyes 
 Lighting up the night 
 When you are with me 
 While the world's in motion, 
 We're like a picture frozen 
 I wanna stay with you as long as I can breathe

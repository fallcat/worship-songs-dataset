Someday I'm gonna go out to the country 
 I'll drive 'til the highway ends 
 Chasing after picture-perfect sunsets 
 To take away my breath 
 I'm tired of living in the city 
 The world's got me tied on a string 
 Wanderlust has overcome me 
 Like Lewis and Clark I'll dream 
 There's a million different ways to go 
 Only God can know where I will call my home 
 Love lead me on 
 Where no one else has gone 
 Faith keep me strong 
 Love lead me on 
 The open road can be so lonely 
 I'm longing for someone to love 
 If only I could share my new surroundings 
 Open the doors above 
 There's a million different ways to go 
 Only God can know where I will call my home 
 Love lead me on 
 Where no one else has gone 
 Faith keep me strong 
 Love lead me on (2x) 
 Faith keep me strong 
 Love lead me home

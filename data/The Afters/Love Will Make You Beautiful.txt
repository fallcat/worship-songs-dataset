Time is slipping away 
 Days go by, fade away 
 With one eye opened, one closed 
 I think you know 
 Love will make you beautiful 
 Love will make you beautiful 
 Thoughts swirl, spinning around 
 Weary, falling down 
 When out of the darkness a hand 
 Reach out 
 Hold fast 
 Love will make you beautiful 
 Love will make you beautiful 
 Turn round this time 
 Love is there to find 
 Lift your head and see 
 Open up your eyes 
 Love will make you beautiful 
 Love will make you beautiful

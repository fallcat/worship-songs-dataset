I try to take a breath 
 Thoughts racing through my head 
 I try to capture it, but a picture can't hold what a heart is feeling 
 I just wanna stop the world from spinning, 
 Slow it all down for a minute so that I can take it in 
 Here we are on top of the stars 
 Never thought we'd ever get this far 
 We live for moments like this 
 We come alive in moments like this 
 Here we are, this is our time 
 Like a dream coming to life 
 We live for moments like this 
 We come alive in moments like this 
 I don't wanna close my eyes I'm feeling so alive 
 I try to find the words, but no words can say what my heart is feeling 
 I just wanna stop the world from spinning, 
 Slow it all down for a minute so that I can take it in 
 We'll hold up a light 
 Burn a hole in the night 
 When we are here 
 For moments like this

I saw you once it was enough 
 You asked me what I wanted, I want you 
 But I replied, "I'll have some fries" 
 So mesmerized, my heart was over driving through 
 I saw your name and unashamed 
 I'd search within 500 miles to find 
 Any clue just as to who I've fallen for 
 'Cause you've got me and I've got time 
 I saw your picture on MySpace 
 Maybe someday we can turn it into our space, baby 
 I don't care how long it takes 
 I'm saving space in my top 8 for you 
 The second time you were so nice 
 I loved the way you told me to enjoy my day 
 But I know what you meant to say instead 
 Was really that you wanted us to run away 
 I said, "Let's go, I'll pack my clothes 
 Just promise me you'll wear that purple dress you have 
 You look so cute when you're confused" 
 You backed away and asked me how I knew about that 
 I saw your picture on MySpace 
 Maybe someday we can turn it into our space, baby 
 I don't care how long it takes 
 I'm saving space in my top 8 for you 
 I know you're scared 
 I know our love is crazy 
 And I'm so crazy 
 You make me crazy for you 
 I saw your picture on MySpace 
 Maybe someday we can turn it into our space, baby 
 I don't care how long it takes 
 I'm saving space in my top 8 for you 
 I saw your picture on MySpace 
 Maybe someday we can turn it into our space, baby 
 I don't care how long it takes 
 I'm saving space in my top 8 for you

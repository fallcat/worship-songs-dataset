It's not the end 
 But it feels like it is 
 I'm waking up 
 Like I'm back from the dead 
 I'm stepping out 
 And I feel so afraid 
 But as long as I'm moving it's all right 
 I feel alive 
 And it hurts for a change 
 And looking back and it's hard to believe 
 That I was cool 
 With the days that I wasted complacent and tasteless and bored but 
 That was yesterday 
 We're never going back to OK 
 We're never going back to easy 
 We're never going back to the way it was 
 We're never going back to OK 
 This discontent 
 Like a slap in the face 
 Of mediocre 
 I've had enough of this place 
 This party's over 
 And I'm moving away from the frills of you Beverly Hills but that was yesterday 
 We're never going back to OK 
 We're never going back to easy 
 We're never going back to the way it was 
 We're never going back to OK 
 We're here to stay 
 This is our time 
 Our only life 
 Our chance to live

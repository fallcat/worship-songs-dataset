Look outside 
 It's already light and the stars 
 Ran away with the night 
 Things we're said 
 Words that we'll try forget 
 It's so hard to admit 
 I know we've made mistakes 
 I see through all the tears 
 And that's what got us here 
 If love is an ocean wide 
 We'll swim in the tears we cry 
 They'll see us through to the other side 
 We're gonna make it 
 When love is a raging sea 
 You can hold on to me 
 We'll find a way tonight 
 Love is an ocean wide 
 I'll stay right here 
 It's where I'll always belong 
 Tied with your arms 
 Days like this 
 I wish the sun wouldn't set 
 I don't wanna forget 
 What made us feel this way 
 You see through all my fears 
 And that's what got us here 
 Love is an ocean wide enough to forget 
 Even when we think we can't 
 Think we can't 
 If love is an ocean wide 
 We'll swim in the tears we cry 
 They'll see us through to the other side 
 We're gonna make it 
 When love is a raging sea 
 You can hold on to me 
 We'll find a way tonight 
 We'll find a way tonight 
 Love is an ocean wide 
 Love is an ocean wide

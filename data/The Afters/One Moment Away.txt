Wake up and smile 
 Put on a tie 
 Walk to the car 
 And wave goodbye 
 Radio on 
 You're singing along 
 It's all gonna change but how could you know 
 You're one moment away 
 One chance left to take 
 And you're gone 
 Are they gonna remember you for running away 
 Or saving the day from the darkness 
 And letting your love shine through 
 What will you do 
 You're one moment away 
 Eyes are on you 
 The pressure is on 
 Where will you stand when the lines have been drawn 
 The clocks have all stopped, the story's been told 
 This is your life, so how will it show 
 No you can't pretend that forever 
 Will never come knocking at your door 
 Run through the flames 
 Never look back 
 What did you think that you came here for

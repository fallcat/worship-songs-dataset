You are calling, I can't hear your voice 
 I am crying tears of no remorse 
 Out of pride and in myself I boast 
 I don't need you 
 I don't want you close 
 But everywhere I see 
 You are drawing me 
 And I just can't go on 
 One more day without you 
 Because you knocked a thousand times 
 And every chance I turned away 
 It seems impossible for me to see 
 How you can love me in the midst 
 Of all my selfishness and greed 
 But now I'm on my knees 
 Begging Jesus please 
 I just can't go on 
 One more day without you 
 I am wandering, you can lead me home 
 You are waiting, aimlessly I roam 
 I am empty, all I have is gone 
 When I stumble, will you catch my fall 
 The paradox is that you found 
 Favor with my soul 
 To escape your grace is all I want 
 But you will not let go

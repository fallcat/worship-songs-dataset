Headlines say it's okay 
 I guess I'll live another day 
 I'll just sit and watch you sleep 
 So innocent it makes me cry 
 I want to take you in my arms 
 And sing to you the song of love 
 Could it be that you're the one 
 Sent by God down from above 
 Are you the one, are you the one 
 I thought I figured it all out 
 I guess I'm living in my head 
 I thought I figured it all out 
 I guess I'm wasting all my time 
 If love's like and ocean, let's go for a swim 
 I'll save you before you drown 
 You'll fly to the heavens, it's where you belong 
 You're perfect and beautiful 
 You have perfection that I lack 
 How could I ever try 
 You hold my feelings and emotions 
 In your little hands 
 Unreadable, unthinkable 
 Too complex to understand 
 I want to take you to a place where 
 We can live the land of tears 
 We will go, we will go 
 I thought I figured it all out 
 I guess I'm living in my head 
 I thought I figured it all out 
 I guess I'm wasting all my time 
 If love's like and ocean, let's go for a swim 
 I'll save you before you drown 
 You'll fly to the heavens, it's where you belong 
 You're perfect and beautiful 
 Perfect and beautiful, perfect and beautiful 
 Perfect and beautiful, perfect and beautiful, Oh 
 You're so beautiful and you're beautiful 
 You're so beautiful, and we'll go away 
 You're so beautiful and you're beautiful 
 You're so beautiful, and we'll go away 
 Away. And we'll go away. Away. 
 If love's like and ocean, let's go for a swim 
 I'll save you before you drown 
 We'll fly to the heavens, it's were we belong 
 We're perfect and beautiful

I saw you walking by 
 I never knew the reason why 
 I saw you stare at me 
 From the corner of your eye 
 I turned away and ran 
 How could I pretend to hide 
 Your love found me 
 I'm gonna make it better for you and me 
 Time is moving on and still I find you in my heart 
 A thousand miles I'd walk to see you smile 
 No more empty words 
 A mountain I would climb 
 If I could meet you at the peak 
 A million stars I'd count 
 Just to feel your warm, sweet embrace 
 A battle I would fight to the end 
 If you were my reward 
 I think our moments gone 
 Will it ever leave my mind 
 I know I'm overcome 
 With the thought of you as mine 
 I saw you walking by 
 Now I realize your love is holding me

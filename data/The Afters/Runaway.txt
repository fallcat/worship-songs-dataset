Hear your voice on the phone 
 And my heart just stopped 
 When you said you're not going home 
 Where are you, are you safe? 
 Are you trying to escape 
 From what you can't undo 
 Hoping that the world forgets you 
 But I can't, no, I won't forget you 
 I know you're out there tonight 
 Looking for somewhere to hide 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 You don't have to run away 
 You're hanging over the edge 
 It's not too late to look back 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 You don't have to runaway 
 Everywhere that you turn 
 Somehow every face 
 Is another bridge that you burn 
 So you think you can't stay 
 If you could find another life 
 In another place 
 And hope the world forgets your name 
 But I can't, no, I won't forget you 
 I know you're out there tonight 
 Looking for somewhere to hide 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 You don't have to run away 
 You're hanging over the edge 
 It's not too late to look back 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 You don't have to runaway 
 You think you've lost it all 
 And there's nothing left of you 
 There's nowhere you could fall 
 Where love won't catch you 
 Love won't catch you 
 Love will catch you 
 Love will catch you 
 Love will catch you 
 I know you're out there tonight 
 Looking for somewhere to hide 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 You don't have to run away 
 You're hanging over the edge 
 It's not too late to look back 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 You don't have to runaway 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 You don't have to runaway 
 You think you've lost it all 
 You think you've lost it all 
 You don't have to runaway 
 You don't have to runaway 
 You don't have to runaway

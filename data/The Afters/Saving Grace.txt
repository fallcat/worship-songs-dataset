Like a man on a wire, I balance between 
 A heart filled with desires 
 A head that knows everything 
 Somewhere out in the middle 
 You found me 
 I've got one foot in the clouds 
 One foot on the ground 
 You keep me steady somehow 
 Keep me from looking down 
 Somewhere out in the middle 
 You found me 
 Falling into you is safe and sound 
 You opened up my eyes, I see it now 
 You're my saving grace 
 You're my saving grace 
 I run to my hiding place 
 My saving grace 
 My life hangs on a string 
 But I'm not afraid 
 I feel Your love down below me 
 If it starts to break 
 Somewhere out in the open 
 You found me 
 Falling into You is safe and sound 
 You opened up my eyes, I see it now 
 You're my saving grace 
 You're my saving grace 
 I run to my hiding place 
 My saving grace 
 My saving grace 
 Carry me now 
 On Your shoulder 
 I won't look down 
 Pull me closer 
 Carry me now 
 On Your shoulder 
 I won't look down 
 Pull me closer 
 Pull me closer 
 You're my saving grace 
 You're my saving grace 
 I run to my hiding place 
 My saving grace 
 My saving grace

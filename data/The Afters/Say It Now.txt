Can we work this out 
 I don't wanna close the door 
 Before the sun goes down 
 We can't let this go too far 
 I'll do anything to meet you anywhere you are 
 'Cause it doesn't matter anymore 
 Who was right or wrong 
 If we could only find the words we've lost 
 Before what we have is gone 
 Say it now 
 Find a way to say it now 
 Don't be afraid to say it now 
 Everything we're keeping inside 
 Don't wait, just let your heart speak 
 Don't waste another heartbeat 
 'Cause we'll never know till we 
 Let it out, let it out 
 Say it, say it now 
 (Say it, say it now) 
 Say it, say it now 
 (Say it, say it now) 
 My heart is wearing thin 
 I don't wanna fight a war 
 That no one's gonna win 
 All this time we've grown apart 
 Looking for an end 
 If I'm the one who's holding on 
 And holding back, here's how we begin 
 We gotta say it now 
 Find a way to say it now 
 Don't be afraid to say it now 
 Everything we're keeping inside 
 Don't wait, just let your heart speak 
 Don't waste another heartbeat 
 'Cause we'll never know till we 
 Let it out, let it out 
 Say it, say it now 
 (Say it, say it now) 
 Say it, say it now 
 (Say it, say it now) 
 I hope we leave it all behind 
 No more getting lost between the lines 
 Can we work this out 
 I don't wanna close the door 
 Before the sun goes down 
 Say it now 
 Find a way to say it now 
 Don't be afraid to say it now 
 Everything we're keeping inside 
 Don't wait, just let your heart speak 
 Don't waste another heartbeat 
 'Cause we'll never know till we 
 Let it out, let it out 
 Say it, say it now 
 (Say it, say it now) 
 Say it, say it now 
 (Say it, say it now) 
 'Cause we'll never know till we let it out, let it out 
 (Say it, say it now) 
 Say it, say it now 
 (Say it, say it now)

I am breaking 
 Through the concrete 
 Like an inmate 
 To the light of day 
 I'll take my chances 
 On the outside 
 With a dark side 
 That I can't escape 
 If you know me you know I got nothing to lose 
 It's do or die but this time I'm gonna do 
 If you know me you know I got nothing to lose 
 Wake up the statues 
 Breathe out the dust 
 Shock of a heartbeat 
 Rush of the blood 
 Breaking in to my skin 
 Feel the burning again 
 I can't escape it 
 It's time to 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 All the circuits 
 Reigniting 
 Like a lighter 
 In a stadium 
 Echoes of angels 
 In cathedrals 
 Calling my name 
 Like a prodigal 
 If you know me you know I got nothing to lose 
 It's do or die but this time I'm gonna do 
 If you know me you know I got nothing to lose 
 Wake up the statues 
 Breathe out the dust 
 Shock of a heartbeat 
 Rush of the blood 
 Breaking in to my skin 
 Feel the burning again 
 I can't escape it 
 It's time to 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 Awaken my soul 
 Awaken my senses 
 This flesh and bones 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 Awaken my soul 
 Awaken my senses 
 This flesh and bones 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 Wake up the statues 
 Breathe out the dust 
 Shock of a heartbeat 
 Rush of the blood 
 Breaking in to my skin 
 Feel the burning again 
 I can't escape it 
 It's time to 
 Rise up from the shadows 
 Wake up the statues 
 Breathe out the dust 
 Shock of a heartbeat 
 Rush of the blood 
 Breaking in to my skin 
 Feel the burning again 
 I can't escape it 
 It's time to 
 Rise up from the shadows

Ready or not the years are blurring 
 Running away the mind is turning 
 Skip to the end to find the meaning 
 Theoughts are fading, yet I wonder still 
 Like it or not your eyes are open 
 Playing around, the circles going 
 Face of a child, your mind is old 
 The clock ran down before I could begin 
 I wish we all could win 
 I wish we all could smile 
 I wish we all could make our mothers proud 
 Want it or not you can't just leave it 
 Throw it away, I can't believe it 
 Walking for days, I know you'll see that 
 Times are changing, soon we'll be the same 
 I wish we all could win 
 I wish we all could smile 
 I wish we all could make our mothers proud 
 Someday, Someday, Someday 
 You'll come around 
 Someday, Someday, Someday 
 Your time will come 
 There's nothing more that I can do 
 I know we all can make throught 
 I hope that someday you will see 
 I wish we all could win 
 I wish we all could smile 
 I wish we all could make our mothers proud 
 Someday, Someday, Someday 
 You'll come around 
 Someday, Someday, Someday 
 Your time will come

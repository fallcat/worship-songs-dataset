Your impossible is possible 
 But your fear is so responsible 
 For keeping you down 
 For keeping you down 
 Your unreachable is reachable 
 But you'll never grab the wonderful 
 With your feet on the ground 
 Your feet on the ground 
 If you fall on your face 
 Don't just leave it to fate 
 No such thing as too late 
 It's not too late 
 To start over, start over, start over 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 You'll never have, have, have 
 What you won't lose 
 So pick it up, up, up, dust off your shoes 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 You gotta find, find, find the other side 
 So give it one, one, one more try 
 And start over 
 You only fail if you never try 
 You'll never live trying not to die 
 I'm telling you now 
 I'm telling you now 
 Don't ever stop, give all you got 
 Don't hesitate to take a shot 
 It all comes around 
 Yeah, it all comes around 
 If you fall on your face 
 Don't just leave it to fate 
 No such thing as too late 
 It's not too late 
 To start over, start over, start over 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 You'll never have, have, have 
 What you won't lose 
 So pick it up, up, up, dust off your shoes 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 You gotta find, find, find the other side 
 So give it one, one, one more try 
 And start over 
 There's so much, so much left to gain 
 And there's so much, so much left to lose 
 You'll never know until you make a move 
 If you fall on your face 
 Don't just leave it to fate 
 No such thing as too late 
 It's not too late 
 Start over, start over, start over, yeah 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 You'll never have, have, have 
 What you won't lose 
 So pick it up, up, up, dust off your shoes 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 You gotta find, find, find the other side 
 So give it one, one, one more try 
 And start over, start over, start over 
 Start over, start over, start over 
 Start over, start over, start over

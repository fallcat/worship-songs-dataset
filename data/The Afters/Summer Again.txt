I'm watching the green give into gold 
 As summer becomes October's cold 
 Gravity begs 
 For one final kiss 
 She drops it to him, as she gives in 
 Traces of light, linger around 
 As laces of white fall to the ground 
 The softest of sounds for the heaviest things 
 And the pain that it brings 
 As she falls I try to catch her 
 For one last touch of warmth from summer 
 As one thing leaves to becomes another again 
 I remember when 
 Don't remember the day, she started to fade 
 The ground felt a chill as she gave it away 
 A whisper - a sigh, for the time that she passed 
 But this winter won't last 
 As she falls I try to catch her 
 For one last touch of warmth from summer 
 As one thing leaves to becomes another again 
 I remember when 
 Oh to be with summer again 
 The days were warm and we wore them like skin 
 Now I feel the effects of October again 
 As she falls I try to catch her 
 For one last touch of warmth from summer 
 As one thing leaves to becomes another again 
 I remember when 
 Oh to be with summer again 
 I'm watching the green give in to gold 
 As summer becomes Octobers cold

I've been waiting in the silence 
 I've been waiting for the morning to arrive 
 I've been waiting in the darkness 
 I've been praying that you just give me a sign 
 That you are close 
 And you will make a way here 
 O God I know 
 You lead me through the night 
 You are the sunrise 
 In my sky, my sky, in my sky 
 Nothing can hide You 
 From my eyes, my eyes, from my eyes 
 The day is coming soon 
 When You'll make all things new 
 You are the sunrise 
 In my sky, in my sky, in my sky 
 When I look at the horizon 
 I can see you reaching through the rain 
 I'll never stop believing 
 I will trust every promise that you made 
 That you are close 
 And you will make a way here 
 O God I know 
 You lead me through the night 
 You are the sunrise 
 In my sky, my sky, in my sky 
 Nothing can hide You 
 From my eyes, my eyes, from my eyes 
 The day is coming soon 
 When You'll make all things new 
 You are the sunrise 
 In my sky, in my sky, in my sky 
 Your love breaks through 
 My darkest night 
 I see it now more than ever 
 All that we've lost 
 Will be made right 
 I see it now more than ever 
 More than ever 
 You are the sunrise 
 In my sky, my sky, in my sky 
 Nothing can hide You 
 From my eyes, my eyes, from my eyes 
 The day is coming soon 
 When You'll make all things new 
 You are the sunrise 
 You are the sunrise 
 When You'll make all things new

We might be 
 Pushed down but we still breathing 
 Heart broke but it's still beating 
 Knocked out but not defeated 
 We might be 
 Lights out but we're on fire 
 Burning it down to the wire 
 Won't stop 'cause we are fighters 
 We are survivors (We are survivors) 
 We are the fighters (We are the fighters) 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know who we are 
 We are survivors (We are survivors) 
 We are the fighters (We are the fighters) 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know we are survivors 
 Survivors, survivors, survivors 
 We might be 
 Slowed down just for a moment 
 A little bent but we're not broken 
 Wounded but we still going 
 We might be 
 Burning like wildfire 
 With our eyes of the tiger 
 We're always reaching higher and higher 
 We are survivors (We are survivors) 
 We are the fighters (We are the fighters) 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know who we are 
 We are survivors (We are survivors) 
 We are the fighters (We are the fighters) 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know we are survivors 
 Survivors, survivors, survivors 
 Until the earth shakes under our feet 
 And the stars crash into the sea 
 When the night falls down to its knees 
 We'll be the last ones standing 
 Last ones standing here 
 We are survivors (We are survivors) 
 We are the fighters (We are the fighters) 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know who we are 
 We are survivors (We are survivors) 
 We are the fighters (We are the fighters) 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know we are survivors 
 We'll be the last ones standing 
 Last ones standing here 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know who we are 
 We'll be the last ones standing 
 Last ones standing here 
 We, we know who we are 
 We know we are survivors

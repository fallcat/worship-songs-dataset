If you're alone tonight 
 And you're not alright with it 
 Take my hand 
 If you're scared to be 
 What you are to me 
 It's alright take my hand 
 Put on a happy face 
 I'm longing to replace your fears 
 With song and dancing 
 La la la la, la la la, la la la 
 La la la la, la la la, la la la 
 If you're tired tonight 
 Of your microwave life 
 It's alright take my hand 
 If you're sick of yourself 
 In your private little hell 
 I can help you if you take my hand 
 Pack up your halo, let's go 
 I've got something to show you 
 Through the door to heaven 
 La la la la, la la la, la la la 
 La la la la, la la la, la la la 
 If you're alone tonight 
 And you're not alright with it 
 La la la la...

Here today, gone tomorrow 
 That's what they want to say about us 
 Say, where's our sorrow 
 Where's our fear getting us 
 Some may say that we are too far gone 
 (I don't believe that it could be so-- 
 How can it be that it could be?) 
 I don't know, but I've been cold too long for my taste 
 I won't sit back any longer 
 I won't be silent anymore 
 I'm stepping into the limelight, baby 
 I'm taking over the world 
 Do you agree with my feelings 
 Could it be that we're the same 
 Don't say that we've hit the ceiling 
 And now we're going down in flames 
 Have we come so far to sit and die 
 (I don't believe that it could be so- How can it be that it could be?) 
 Precious Jesus, did you give us 
 Life so we could compromise 
 To sit and watch the world decline 
 To face perdition's flames with resignation

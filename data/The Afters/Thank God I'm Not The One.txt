How could You walk 
 When You went down that dusty street 
 How could You speak 
 When all your friends checked out 
 How could You love 
 After the great betrayal 
 How could You reach out 
 When they nailed You down 
 True as true can be 
 That's what they say You are to me 
 When I'm so fake 
 Does Your heart ache 
 If I had been the one 
 I would not have been that strong 
 If I had been the one, yeah 
 I'd have been long gone 
 How could You hang on 
 With Your mama crying 
 How could You keep on breathing in and out 
 How could You watch 
 While Your whole world was dying 
 Did it all happen 
 'Cause we let You down 
 True as true can be 
 That's what they say You are to me 
 When I'm so fake 
 Does Your heart ache 
 If I had been the one 
 I would not have been that strong 
 If I had been the one, yeah 
 I'd have been long gone 
 And all the things we think of as eternal 
 Would come undone 
 All I have to say is when I'm praying 
 Is Thank God I'm not the One

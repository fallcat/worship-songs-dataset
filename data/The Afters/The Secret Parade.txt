Don't try to lose us 'cause it's right where you'll find us 
 Don't try to bruise us 'cause it's right where you bleed 
 Don't call me a stranger, we're your brothers and sisters 
 Try to refuse when it's just what you need 
 Here tomorrow, gone today 
 We're a part of the secret parade 
 Here tomorrow, gone today 
 We're a part of the secret parade

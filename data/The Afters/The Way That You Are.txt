Until You came I was just the same 
 As everybody else 
 Whoever saw the light and turned away 
 You love me now 
 You loved me then 
 And every now and then 
 You show me how it would be if I'd gone the other way 
 After all this time I've come to find my soul's fragility 
 But You've rectified my frailty by your strength 
 It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth 
 Like atomic bombs in reverse 
 As if a glass could contain the sea 
 That's the way You are in me 
 That's the way You are 
 Now here I stand looking back 
 To the way things used to be 
 But I will never be alone again 
 'Cause You're with me 
 And now I see 
 What it means to me 
 To be a part of such a mystery 
 After all this time I've come to find my soul's fragility 
 But You've rectified my frailty by your strength 
 It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth 
 Like atomic bombs in reverse 
 As if a glass could contain the sea 
 That's the way You are in me 
 That's the way You are 
 -Instrumental- 
 After all this time I've come to find my soul's fragility 
 But You've rectified my frailty by your strength 
 It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth 
 Like atomic bombs in reverse 
 As if a glass could contain the sea 
 That's the way You are in me 
 That's the way You are in me 
 That's the way You are in me 
 That's the way You are in...

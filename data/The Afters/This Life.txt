I come in to tuck her in 
 I'm so tired from where I've been 
 Doing all I can to stay awake 
 As she goes on about her day 
 I hang on every word she says 
 She reaches out and puts her hand in mine 
 For a moment 
 We are here together 
 And it hits me that this won't last forever 
 We can't own it 
 We just get to hold it for a while 
 This life 
 We can't keep it 
 Or save it for another time 
 This life 
 He was always there for me 
 Now he's fighting just to breathe 
 I tell him it's ok to let go 
 As I look into his eyes 
 I know that this won't be the last time 
 But for now 
 We're taking different roads 
 For a moment 
 We are here together 
 And it hits me that this won't last forever 
 What we give is all we have 
 How we love is what will last 
 And this hope we know will carry us through this life 
 We were never meant to stay 
 So we don't have to be afraid 
 Of what is waiting on the other side

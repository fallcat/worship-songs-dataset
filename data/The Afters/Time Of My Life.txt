Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Above the diamonds in the sky 
 Below my feet is gold and I'm 
 Never gonna leave, never gonna leave this place 
 Never wanna leave this place 
 Like a scene from a different life 
 Like a dream that we'll never die 
 Never wanna leave, never wanna leave this place 
 Never gonna leave this place 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Come alive in this atmosphere 
 You can be who you are in here 
 Never gonna leave, never gonna leave this place 
 Never wanna leave this place 
 We don't ever have to leave this town 
 We don't ever have to come back down 
 Never wanna leave, never wanna leave this place 
 Never gonna leave this place 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Better be ready when the sun comes down 
 When the sun comes down, when the sun comes down 
 Better be ready when the stars come out 
 When the stars come out, when the stars come out 
 Better be ready when the sun comes down 
 When the sun comes down, when the sun comes down 
 Better be ready when the stars come out 
 When the stars come down 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Tonight I'm having the time 
 I'm having the time of my life 
 My life 
 Better be ready when the sun comes down 
 When the sun comes down, when the sun comes down 
 Better be ready when the stars come out 
 When the stars come out, when the stars come out 
 Better be ready when the sun comes down 
 When the sun comes down, when the sun comes down 
 Better be ready when the stars come out 
 I'm having the time of my life

Time after time I'm reminded that I fall apart 
 When I run away from you 
 Even when every mistake 
 Leaves me broken and bruised 
 I can hold on to you 
 Tonight, tonight we're gonna put it all, put it all behind 
 Tonight, tonight we're gonna make it all, make it alright 
 We'll be who we want to be tonight 
 Why do I feel like a space 
 That just waits to be filled 
 Looking for something new 
 When ours is love that is already perfect and I know I belong to you 
 When tomorrow comes we're gonna feel alive 
 Somehow forget about the tears we cried 
 There's so much more we have to gain than we could ever lose

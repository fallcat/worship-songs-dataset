I lose myself to find in me 
 The way it really ought to be 
 It's hard to say I love you 
 It's hard to say I need you 
 If all is well it's hard to tell 
 It hurts to think of someone else 
 It's hard to say I'll be there 
 It's hard to say I really, really care 
 Until the world won't turn 
 Till the planets burn 
 Until the sun dies I'll be there 
 Until the heavens come 
 Till this life is done 
 Until the world dies I'll be there 
 I can't see outside myself 
 How can I love for someone else 
 It's hard to say I'm sorry 
 It's hard to say forgive me 
 I can't believe you're here with me 
 Into the future I can't see 
 It's hard to say forever 
 It's hard to say I'll never ever go 
 Until the world won't turn 
 Till the planets burn 
 Until the sun dies I'll be there 
 Until the heavens come 
 Till this life is done 
 Until the world dies I'll be there (3x)

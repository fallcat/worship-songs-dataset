Wait, I can hardly wait 
 To look into Your face 
 When the world disappears into Your eyes 
 Wait, I can hardly wait 
 To hear your sweet voice say 
 You've done well, my good and faithful son 
 Breathe, I can hardly breathe 
 In anticipation 
 Waiting for the day to come 
 When You will shine on me 
 Wait, I can hardly wait 
 To bow at Your feet 
 Kiss the scars that bore my sins away 
 Breathe, I can hardly breathe 
 In anticipation 
 Waiting for the day to come 
 When You will shine on me 
 Shine on me 
 Wait, I can hardly wait

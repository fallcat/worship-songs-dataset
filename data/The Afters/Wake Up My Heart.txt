Stop my world, slow it down for a minute 
 Be my eyes, let me see why I'm in it 
 And wake up my heart, wake up my heart for You 
 As I walk through the hills and the valleys 
 Be my feet so I go where You want me 
 And wake up my heart, wake up my heart for You 
 I want to love all the things that You love 
 I want to live to see Your kingdom come 
 I want to see everything through Your eyes 
 Through Your eyes 
 Won't You wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Tear down the walls I keep building higher 
 Come burn in me like a wildfire 
 And wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Wash away all my doubt like a river 
 Come like a warm sunny day in the winter 
 And wake up my heart, wake up my heart for You 
 I want to love all the things that You love 
 I want to live to see Your kingdom come 
 I want to see everything through Your eyes 
 Through Your eyes 
 Won't You wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Tear down the walls I keep building higher 
 Come burn in me like a wildfire 
 And wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 I have been like a desert, all dried up 
 Come and pour over me like a raging flood 
 I want to love all the things that You love 
 I want to live to see Your kingdom come 
 Won't You wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Tear down the walls I keep building higher 
 Come burn in me like a wildfire 
 And wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You 
 Wake up my heart 
 Wake up my heart for You, for You

Now is the time we have 
 Take it, never give it back 
 Say what you mean to say 
 This could be your only chance 
 Everybody's watching out 
 For someone who can show them how 
 To be what they wanna be and 
 Stand never backing down 
 Here we are 
 Here we are 
 We are the sound 
 We are the siren 
 We're all around 
 And we won't stop singing it out 
 Shout it out 
 Like you believe it 
 We'll break it down 
 When we all start singing it out 
 Shout it out now 
 Silence is an enemy 
 That keeps us from the things we need 
 It ages but it never grows 
 So quiet that we start to bleed 
 Lets shake it off and let it go 
 Forgetting what we think we know 
 We'll make it all a memory 
 We're taking back control

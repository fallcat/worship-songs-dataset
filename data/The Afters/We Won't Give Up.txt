Everywhere, everyday 
 All we hear is 
 All we hear is wait 
 It's not your time 
 Just get back in line 
 And they can try to knock us down 
 We've got our feet nailed to the ground 
 If you wanna count us out, go ahead 
 But it's not over yet 
 We won't back down 
 We gotta take our best shot 
 Give it all we got now 
 We won't back down 
 They say we'll never make it 
 But we're gonna take it all the way 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 And with the clock running down 
 We're gonna leave our fears 
 And failures all behind, this is our time 
 We'll reach till we touch the sky 
 We won't back down 
 We gotta take our best shot 
 And give it all we got now 
 We won't back down 
 They say we'll never make it 
 But we're gonna take it all the way 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't hold back 
 And we won't slow down the pace 
 We won't let go 
 And we won't call off the chase 
 We won't back down 
 We gotta take our best shot 
 And give it all we got now 
 We won't back down 
 They say we'll never make it 
 But we're gonna take it all the way 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up 
 They say we'll never make it 
 But we're gonna take it all the way 
 We won't give up 
 We won't give up

What will it be like when my pain is gone 
 And all the worries of this world just fade away? 
 What will it be like when You call my name 
 And that moment when I see You face to face? 
 I'm waiting my whole life to hear You say 
 Well done, well done 
 My good and faithful one 
 Welcome to the place where you belong 
 Well done, well done 
 My beloved child 
 You have run the race and now you're home 
 Welcome to the place where you belong 
 What will it be like when tears are washed away 
 And every broken thing will finally be made whole? 
 What will it be like when I come into Your glory 
 Standing in the presence of a love so beautiful? 
 I'm waiting my whole life for that day 
 I will live my life to hear You say 
 Well done, well done 
 My good and faithful one 
 Welcome to the place where you belong 
 Well done, well done 
 My beloved child 
 You have run the race and now you're home 
 Welcome to the place where you belong 
 What will it be like when I hear that sound? 
 All of heaven's angels crying out: 
 Singing holy, holy, holy are You, Lord 
 Singing holy, holy, holy are You, Lord 
 Singing holy, holy, holy are You, Lord 
 Waiting my whole life for that day 
 Until then I'll live to hear You say 
 Well done, well done 
 My good and faithful one 
 Welcome to the place where you belong 
 Well done, well done 
 My beloved child 
 You have run the race and now you're home 
 Welcome to the place where you belong 
 Well done

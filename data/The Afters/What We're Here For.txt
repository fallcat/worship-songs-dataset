This is what we're here for 
 This is what we're here for 
 Friday, came home waved to a neighbor I don't know 
 He smiled at me and I believed he was doing just fine 
 His eyes can't lie 
 There's something tearing him up on the inside 
 I wonder what it is, I should ask him 
 But I've got my own life 
 Will I pass by? 
 Or am I gonna take the time? 
 This is what we're here for 
 To show the world how You love it 
 This is what we're made for 
 To lay it all down like You did 
 When we feel useless, You still use us 
 Help us not forget 
 This is what we're here for 
 This is what we're here for 
 We're here to slow down, reach out 
 And take a better look around 
 Just a little bit of time can change a life 
 So I won't walk by and leave up to the next guy 
 I wanna be what I believe all of the time 
 I've got my own life, but it's not mine 
 This is what we're here for 
 To show the world how You love it 
 This is what we're made for 
 To lay it all down like You did 
 When we feel useless, You still use us 
 Help us not forget 
 This is what we're here for 
 This is what we're here for 
 To give, to love, to be the ones to show that you have overcome the dark 
 The night, the pain we fight that You are alive 
 This is what we're here for 
 To show the world how You love it 
 This is what we're made for 
 To lay it all down like You did 
 When we feel useless, You still use us 
 Help us not forget 
 This is what we're here for 
 This is what we're here for

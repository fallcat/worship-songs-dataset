Waiting, I was waiting 
 So many long and lonely nights 
 Searching, I was searching 
 For something I could never find 
 But I knew in that moment 
 When your eyes met up with mine 
 All my wait was over 
 And that's when you changed my life 
 The sun shines brighter when you are here 
 My heart beats louder and time just disappears 
 Everything is how it should be 
 When you're with me 
 Dreamers, we are dreaming 
 Of all the days that lie ahead 
 Nothing, there is nothing 
 That can take all that we have 
 Hold you, I will hold you 
 Through the better and the worse 
 Promise, oh I promise 
 And I'm not just saying words 
 The sun shines brighter when you are here 
 My heart beats louder and time just disappears 
 Everything is how it should be 
 And I can't stop counting my lucky stars 
 I'll always want to be where you are 
 Everything is how it should be 
 When you're with me 
 I will always love you 
 I will always love you 
 The sun shines brighter when you are here 
 My heart beats louder and time just disappears 
 Everything is how it should be 
 And I can't stop counting my lucky stars 
 I'll always want to be where you are 
 Everything is how it should be 
 When you're with me 
 Dreamers, we are dreaming 
 Of all the days that lie ahead 
 With you, I'll be with you 
 Until the very end

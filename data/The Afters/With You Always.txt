Just another lonely night inside these walls 
 Hearing the tears that fall and echo through the halls 
 In that moment, all alone 
 When my strength is nearly gone 
 And it feels like it's the end 
 I can hear you say again 
 I am with you 
 I am with you always 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 I'll be comfort through the pain 
 I am with you 
 I am with you always 
 Know that I'll be right beside you 
 Even on the hardest days 
 I'm with you always 
 I have everything I thought I wanted in this life 
 And from the outside everything is looking fine 
 But on the inside 
 Crying out 
 No one hears me make a sound 
 But you hear me when I pray 
 Through the silence I hear you say 
 For every moment of your life 
 For every smile and tear you cry 
 Even when your heart will break 
 When it feels like more than you can take 
 Through every single sleepless night 
 And every battle that you fight 
 From now until the end of time 
 I am with you

My heart is as frail as a dove 
 And my spirit is as weak as a rose 
 See my sorrow, feel my pain 
 You're my refuge, You're my reason 
 My strength in this beautiful place 
 That's where I'll find God 
 That's where I'll find God 
 You're in my heart, You're in my soul 
 You are my heaven, You're my home 
 You're my best friend, You're my true love 
 You are my treasure, You're my God 
 I watch as the mountains fall down 
 And the rivers part at your feet 
 Your creation sings Your praise 
 Even winds obey and angels bow down 
 At Your beautiful voice 
 That's where I'll find God 
 You're in my heart, You're in my soul 
 You are my heaven, You're my home 
 You're my best friend, You're my true love 
 You are my treasure, You're my God 
 You're my God 
 You're in my heart, You're in my soul 
 You are my heaven, You're my home 
 You're my best friend, You're my true love 
 You are my treasure, You're my God 
 You are my peace, You are my joy 
 You are my Savior, You're my God

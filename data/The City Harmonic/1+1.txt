Lord, can I love just like love Himself 
 And live out my life for my bride? 
 Am I strong enough to be built on You? 
 I pray that it's 1+1 
 And that makes 3 of us 
 2 of us 1 heart to Your heart 
 Here we are standing now side by side 
 With the rest of our lives in our eyes 
 I know I'll find her heart deep within Yours 
 I thank God it's 1+1 
 And that makes 3 of us 
 2 of us 1 heart to Your heart 
 I am hers, she is mine 
 And we dance in the palm of Your hand 
 'Cause a cord of 3 strands is not easily broken 
 No, love will keep hoping and I 
 Thank God it's 1+1 
 And that makes 3 of us 
 2 of us 1 heart to 
 Your heart

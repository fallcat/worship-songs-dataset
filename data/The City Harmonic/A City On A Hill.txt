Blessed are the poor for the kingdom is yours 
 Blessed when you mourn, there's comfort in His arms 
 Blessed are the meek with the world at your feet 
 Blessed when it's righteousness that you seek 
 It's beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Like a city on a hill 
 Lighting up the night 
 For the glory of the Lord 
 Rise and shine 
 We will... 
 Shine 
 Light of the world 
 We can't hide it 
 This beautiful light it 
 Shines 
 For all of the world 
 To believe we can be 
 A city on a hill 
 Blessed when you're merciful, you'll find grace 
 Blessed are the pure, you'll see the face of God 
 Blessed are you making peace on earth 
 Blessed when you follow, even when it hurts 
 It's beautiful 
 Beautiful 
 Like a city on a hill 
 Lighting up the night 
 For the glory of the Lord 
 Rise and shine 
 We will... 
 Shine 
 Light of the world 
 We can't hide it 
 This beautiful light it 
 Shines 
 For all of the world 
 To believe we can be 
 A city on a hill 
 For the glory of The Lord -- Rise and shine [x3] 
 For the glory of The Lord 
 The glory of the Lord

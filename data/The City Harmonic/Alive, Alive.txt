It's all right 
 It's all right 
 It's all right 
 I've been told it's all right that sometimes I'm just not all right 
 It's ok 
 It's ok 
 It's ok 
 It's ok to admit you're in over your head some days 
 I am on my knees 
 Barely in one piece 
 Hanging on to what He's done for me 
 My God saves and I'm up from the grave 
 I'm alive that's what He's done for me 
 Live or die: I'll be alive 
 Alive! Alive! That's what He's done for me 
 My God, that's what He's done for me 
 Even if I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I won't fear no evil 'cause my God, He won't leave me there 
 I'm standing in one piece 
 With each breath I breathe 
 I'm reminded of what He's done for me 
 My God saves and I'm up from the grave 
 I'm alive that's what He's done for me 
 Live or die: I'll be alive 
 Alive! Alive! That's what He's done for me 
 My God, that's what He's done for me 
 There's more to life than me 
 Maybe it's time that I believed that 
 My God saves and I'm up from the grave 
 I'm alive that's what He's done for me 
 Live or die: I'll be alive 
 Alive! Alive! That's what He's done for me 
 My God, that's what You've done for me 
 Oh, my God that's what You've done for me. 
 Now it's all right 
 It's all right 
 It's all right

I have breathed in deep 
 The sweetest scent of spring, 
 I've been silenced by the stars 
 I've been lost in melody that 
 Made me weep and said, 
 "Oh, how great Thou art" 
 You are more 
 You are more 
 You are all of this and more 
 More than a fleeting touch 
 More than just flesh and blood 
 More than a mystery 
 You're all of this and more 
 More than a promise kept 
 More than my life and death 
 More than a miracle 
 You're all of this and more 
 All of this and more 
 You have whispered silently 
 Of all You've done for me 
 It took my breath away 
 You have opened wide 
 The arms of love Divine and shown 
 Such amazing grace 
 You are more 
 You are more 
 You are who all this is for 
 You are more 
 You are more 
 You are all of this and more 
 More than a fleeting touch 
 More than just flesh and blood 
 More than a mystery 
 You're all of this and more 
 More than a promise kept 
 More than my life and death 
 More than a miracle 
 You're all of this and more 
 It's never enough to say I need You 
 More than anything else 
 'Cause I need You like a fire 
 Needs the air to feel alive 
 More than a fleeting touch 
 More than just flesh and blood 
 More than a mystery 
 You're all of this and more 
 More than a promise kept 
 More than my life and death 
 More than a miracle 
 You're all of this and more 
 All of this and more

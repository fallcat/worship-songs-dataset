O be still, O my soul and know 
 That the Lord that you love is Lord over it all 
 Don't you know 
 He's the one who can make great from wrong 
 Praise the Lord, O my soul 
 Though you're tired and old 
 Be still and know He is God, ooh 
 O my soul 
 O as high as heaven from earth 
 So great is His love for those of the dirt 
 He knows just what I am 
 And I'm made up of dust 
 Praise the Lord, O my soul 
 Though you're tired and old 
 Be still and know He is God, ooh ooh ooh 
 Go on and live like you know you've been given 
 Forgiveness and healing and love never-ending 
 Go on and love, go on and love, go on and love 
 Go on and love 
 O my soul

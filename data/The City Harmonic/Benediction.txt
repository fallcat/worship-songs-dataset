Grace peace and love to you 
 Hope from above to you 
 Joyfully give all the glory to God 
 As you live like you mean it 
 And sing like you're living for God 
 Go on the power of His glorious might 
 All of you saints in His kingdom of love 
 Live like you mean it 
 And sing like you're living for God 
 Good-bye 
 This is good-bye

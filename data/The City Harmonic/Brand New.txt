This young heart: it needs You 
 Mark by fire: brand me new 
 It's only in Your hands I even stand a chance 
 It's only by Your grace that young hearts can be made 
 Brand new 
 This old soul: it needs You 
 Take my all and make brand new 
 It's only in Your love that life amounts to much 
 It's only by Your peace that this old soul can be 
 Brand new 
 So change my mind: it needs You 
 Captivate: make brand new 
 It's only in the Light that I find peace of mind 
 And it's only by the Son that a mind can be made up 
 Brand new 
 With all my strength I need You 
 So take old wine: make brand new 
 It's only in Your blood that death can be undone 
 And when sweet dawn shall break: on that day I'll awake 
 Brand new

I won't wait, no, I won't wait for Heaven 
 'Cause I believe Heaven's coming my way 
 While I'm alive, I'll be gettin' on with livin' 
 Like You're comin' my way 
 Comin' my way 
 And I'll be comin' Your way 
 Comin' Your way 
 I can't wait to meet You in the middle 
 Up in the air to welcome You home 
 And on the way we'll be gettin' things ready 
 'Cause You're comin' my way 
 Comin' my way 
 And I'll be comin' Your way 
 Comin' Your way 
 'Cause You're comin' my way 
 Comin' my way 
 And I'll be comin' Your way 
 Comin' Your way 
 Oh, I once was lost 
 Oh, and now I'm found 
 It's like 
 A spark lit a fire and it won't burn out 
 A spark lit a fire and it won't burn out 
 A spark lit a fire, now it won't burn out 
 Oh, it'll never burn out

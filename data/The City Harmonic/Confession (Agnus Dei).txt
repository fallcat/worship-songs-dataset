Christ, what have we done? 
 O my God, what have we become? 
 We're like the priest that passes by 
 The broken and bruised on the other side 
 Clang our cymbals, sing our hymns 
 But turn a blind eye to our sin, 
 Singing, Christ have mercy on us 
 Lamb of God who takes away 
 The sin of the world 
 We are sinners gone astray 
 Have mercy Lord 
 Lamb of God who takes away 
 The sin of the world 
 We are sinners gone astray 
 Have mercy Lord 
 Proud, we have played God 
 Arrogant rebels from the start 
 Dying to kill who You let live 
 Eager to judge who You'll forgive 
 Mad for the glitter of our gold 
 But we can't buy or sell that soul 
 Though we confess, You take the blame 
 Lamb of God we plead, we pray, 
 Singin', Christ have mercy on us 
 Lamb of God who takes away 
 The sin of the world 
 We are sinners gone astray 
 Have mercy Lord 
 Lamb of God who takes away 
 The sin of the world 
 We are sinners gone astray 
 Have mercy Lord 
 Redeemer of the world, 
 Forgiveness is divine! 
 In Christ, the Risen Son 
 There is no sin too great to reconcile! 
 Redeemer of the world, 
 Forgiveness is divine! 
 In Christ, the Risen Son 
 There is no sin too great to reconcile! 
 Redeemer of the world, (Lamb of God who takes away) 
 Forgiveness is divine! (The sin of the world) 
 In Christ, the Risen Son, (We are sinners saved by grace) 
 There is no sin too great to reconcile! (We have peace with God) 
 Redeemer of the world, (Lamb of God who takes away)

 Redeemer of the world

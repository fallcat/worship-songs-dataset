Oh 
 Put me back together 
 I fell apart 
 You are Creator 
 You understand my heart 
 Man is prone to wander 
 I feel it everyday 
 Put me back together 
 Won't You find away 
 If You are who You say You are 
 Won't You be who You've always been to me 
 Lord I crave for the real thing 
 Just a taste 
 You're something real in a world of fake 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh my sin of my heart 
 Begs for bread from a stone 
 If You are who You say You are 
 Can I live on words alone 
 Tell me where's that hope and peace 
 Tell me where's that grace 
 Words that heal this heart of mine 
 Lord, You found a way 
 If You are who You say You are 
 Won't You be who You've always been to me 
 Lord I crave for the real thing 
 Just a taste 
 You're something real in a world of fake 
 Bread of life 
 Light of the world 
 Your home of rest 
 I may come in 
 Good Shepherd 
 Resurrection Lamb 
 The Life, true vine 
 You are my God 
 You have spoken 
 You found a way 
 You found a way 
 You are the way 
 You're the real thing 
 You're the real thing 
 You're the real thing 
 You're the real thing 
 You're the real thing

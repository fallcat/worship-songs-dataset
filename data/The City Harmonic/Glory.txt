Image of the unseen Father 
 The beginning and the end 
 All is from Him, to Him, through Him 
 All together, held within 
 Christ the Glorious One 
 Christ the Father's Son 
 Christ the Glory of God 
 Like the thunder roaring: 
 Singin' like we're made to sing 
 Giving Glory glory: to God be the glory 
 Like a crash of lightning 
 Shine a light for all to see 
 Singin' glory, glory 
 To God be the glory 
 He's the head of We, the Body 
 In Him God was pleased to dwell 
 Death can't hold Him: He is risen 
 All things to Him reconciled 
 Like the thunder roaring 
 Singin' like we're made to sing 
 Giving Glory glory: to God be the glory 
 Like a crash of lightning 
 Shine a light for all to see 
 Singin' glory, glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Christ the Risen One 
 Christ the Kingdom come 
 Christ the Glory of God 
 Like the thunder roaring: 
 Singin' like we're made to sing 
 Giving Glory glory: to God be the glory 
 Like a crash of lightning 
 Shine a light for all to see 
 Singin' glory, glory 
 To God be the glory 
 Glory be to God: Christ the Father's Son 
 Glory be to God: Christ the Kingdom come 
 Glory be to God!

Heart beat, little heart 
 There You are, there You are 
 I came kicking, I came screaming: 
 I was so used to the dark 
 You whispered "light" and lit a spark 
 And there You are, there You are 
 I've been living, I've been dying 
 And Your heart beats ever on 
 You were 
 You are 
 You are 
 To come 
 If I'm barely hanging on: 
 Here You are, here You are 
 I come crawling, I come running: 
 Here You are with open arms 
 No, my heart's not giving up 
 Here You are, here You are 
 You've been living in my dying 
 Now I'm dying for Your heart 
 You were 
 You are 
 You are 
 To come [x2] 
 My heart is like Pandora's Box 
 With just a crack it's opened up 
 To beat anew when all is lost 
 To run, crawl, come home. 
 You are to come

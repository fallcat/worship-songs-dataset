This is the story of the Son of God 
 Hangin' on a cross for me 
 But it ends with a bride and groom 
 And a weddin' by a glassy sea 
 Oh, death, where is your sting? 
 'Cause I'll be there singin' 
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord 
 This is the story of a bride in white 
 Waitin' on her weddin' day 
 Anticipation wellin' up inside 
 While her groom is crowned a King 
 Oh, death, where is your sting? 
 'Cause we'll be there singin' 
 Holy, holy, holy is the Lord 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lord almighty 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lord almighty 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy 
 (Who was, and is, and is to come) 
 Is the Lord almighty 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy 
 (Who was, and is, and is to come) 
 Is the Lord almighty 
 This is the story of the son of God 
 Hangin' on a cross for me 
 (Holy, holy, holy, holy) 
 And it ends with a bride and groom 
 And a weddin' by a glassy sea 
 (Holy, holy, holy, holy) 
 (Is the Lord almighty) 
 This is the story of a bride in white 
 Singin' on her weddin' day 
 (Holy, holy, holy, holy) 
 Altogether all that was, and is 
 Can stand before her God and sing 
 (Holy, holy, holy, holy) 
 (Is the Lord almighty) 
 Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy 
 Is the Lord almighty

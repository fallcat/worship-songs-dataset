I am a man who built his house on sand 
 I am a thief upon a cross 
 I'm just like Judas, that sorry fool 
 Who can't be glad for what he's got 
 That's why I'm hanging on to the cross 
 On which I've flung my hopes and dreams 
 It's by the grace of God I hang my head and sing 
 My God, You are good 
 You are great, You are love 
 My God, You are good 
 You are great, You are love 
 I am, I am a man who has been bought by love 
 I am a man who sold his soul 
 I'm like the man who when he found his pearl 
 He gave up everything he owned 
 That's why I'm hanging on to the cross 
 On which I've flung my hopes and dreams 
 It's by the grace of God I lift my hands and sing, sing 
 My God, You are good 
 You are great, You are love 
 Oh, my God, You are good 
 You are great, You are love 
 Oh, my God, You are good 
 You are great, You are love 
 Oh, my God, You are good 
 You are great, You are love 
 You are love, You are love, You are love 
 And I am loved

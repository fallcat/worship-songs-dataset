I have a dream that you can have with me 
 Of a city that shines so bright at night 
 Where love is true, but this love, He finds you 
 And there is a fire in His eyes 
 Where I can see everything's alright 
 It feels like home, sweet home 
 There's no, no, no, no, no 
 No, no place like home 
 When I'm awake that day in glory 
 Your love will light the city streets 
 Oh, and we won't need our songs of longing 
 We'll be a symphony of peace 
 Brothers and sisters, we'll be free 
 Thank God almighty, we'll be free 
 Feels like home, sweet home 
 There's no, no, no, no, no 
 No, no place like home 
 Sweet home 
 There's no, no, no, no, no 
 No, no place like home, yeah 
 Oh, I hear them bells a-ringing 
 Oh, I see the city lights 
 Oh, the dream is real until you close your eyes 
 It feels like home, home, home 
 It feels like home, home, home 
 It feels like home, home, home 
 It feels like home

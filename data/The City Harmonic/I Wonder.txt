I see it in the night, that sacred dark 
 I see it in her eyes as they shine like stars 
 I see the love of God and I wonder on 
 I Wonder 
 'Cause with a love like this 
 How could I understand? 
 The love of God is bigger than 
 My beating heart 
 O Lord I know 
 One day with eyes wide open 
 I'll be face to face 
 With a God of love, 
 And so until that Kingdom Come... 
 You know, I'll wonder on. 
 I see it in the pain of the widowed wife 
 In death defeated where he found true life 
 I see the love of God and I feel alive 
 I Wonder. 
 'Cause with a love like this 
 How could I understand? 
 The love of God is bigger than 
 My beating heart 
 O Lord I know 
 One day with eyes wide open 
 I'll be face to face 
 With a God of love, 
 And so until that Kingdom Come... 
 The kingdom of once and for all... 
 You know, I'll wonder on. 
 I see it in the stars, I see it in the night, 
 I see it in the air, I see it in the light 
 I see it in true love, I see it in her eyes 
 I see it in the way I see it here tonight. 
 Yeah.

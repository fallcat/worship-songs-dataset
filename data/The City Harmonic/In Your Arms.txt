It's true love that loves when I've failed 
 Oh how, oh how You love me 
 I hide, You tear down the veil 
 Oh how, oh how You love me 
 I've tried and tried to do it all on my own 
 Still, oh how You love me 
 Till I learned to fall down 
 Oh how, oh how I love You 
 Now I've found freedom in the fall 
 Into Your arms 
 Into Your arms I'm falling 
 Into Your arms 
 Into Your arms 
 Set free but I'll choose the chains of true love, 
 Oh how I love You 
 You lead, show me the way of true love, 
 Oh how I love You 
 I don't believe that I can do it myself 
 No, oh how I love You 
 'Cause I fell, safe in the arms of true love, 
 Oh how I love You, now 
 I've found freedom in the fall 
 Into Your arms 
 Into Your arms I'm falling 
 Into Your arms 
 Into Your arms 
 I was afraid, there in the fall 
 Until I fell into Your arms 
 Oh 
 Into Your arms 
 Into Your arms I'm falling 
 Into Your arms 
 Into Your arms 
 Oh

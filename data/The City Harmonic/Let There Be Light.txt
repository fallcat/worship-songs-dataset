From the chaos You composed 
 A song that all creation knows 
 You took a mess, and You made life 
 You said, "Let there be light." 
 Word of God, God from the start 
 Recreating human hearts 
 Make us like the moon at night 
 A mirror of the light 
 With just a word set the dark to flight 
 Sing to the world, "Let there be light!" 
 O Word of God, let there be light 
 Cut through the dark, 
 Oh, Let there be light! 
 Come risen Son in glory bright 
 Come Word of God 
 Oh, Let there be light 
 We're desperate for the break of dawn 
 To be won by the risen Son 
 Grace and justice, here collide 
 To keep us through the night 
 With just a word, set the dark to flight 
 Sing to the world, "Let there be light!" 
 O Word of God, let there be light 
 Cut through the dark, 
 Oh, Let there be light! 
 Come risen Son in glory bright 
 Come Word of God 
 Oh, Let there be light 
 Sing now, sing into the dark 
 Sing to lonely hearts, 
 Oh sing, "Let there be light." 
 Sing out when we see the sun 
 For our light has come 
 And the dead have come alive 
 O Word of God, let there be light 
 Cut through the dark, 
 Oh, Let there be light! 
 Come risen Son in glory bright 
 Come Word of God 
 Oh, Let there be light 
 O Word of God, let there be light 
 Cut through the dark, 
 Oh, Let there be light! 
 Come risen Son in glory bright 
 Come Word of God 
 Oh, Let there be light 
 O Word of God, let there be light 
 Cut through the dark, 
 Oh, Let there be light! 
 Come risen Son in glory bright 
 Come Word of God 
 Oh, Let there be light

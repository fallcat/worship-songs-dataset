We say that "love is all you need" 
 We say that love, it comes for free 
 And in a way I must agree 
 But, love, it cost Him everything 
 'Cause we are in love 
 For God, He loved us 
 'Cause if we live love we are like a love letter 
 From the heart of God who loves like no other 
 To the lost and lonely heart, so together we will live love 
 Live love 
 Love, it is a bleeding heart 
 And love, it doesn't count the cost 
 Love, the price is paid 'cause Love has made a way 
 For us to shine like stars 
 We are in Love 
 'Cause God, He loved us 
 'Cause if we live love we are like a love letter 
 From the heart of God who loves like no other 
 To the lost and lonely heart, so together we will live love 
 Live love. 
 Live love: my sisters, my brothers 
 Live love: it's the heartbeat of heaven 
 So live love: 'cause You're the love letter 
 Live love. 
 'Cause if we live love we are like a love letter 
 From the heart of God who loves like no other 
 To the lost and lonely heart so together we will live love 
 Live love

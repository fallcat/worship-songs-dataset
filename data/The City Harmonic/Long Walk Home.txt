It's a long walk home for the heart and soul 
 And as for me and mine we've got a ways to go 
 So I thank the Lord I don't walk alone 
 'Cause He's a light unto my winding road 
 Step by step 
 Day by day 
 It's a long walk home 
 But I know the Way 
 And I, for one, will run this old race 
 Till Kingdom come and I see His face 
 Death, he keeps an easy street 
 But that highway isn't meant for me 
 Step by step 
 Day by day 
 It's a long walk home 
 But I know the Way 
 And I, for one, will run this old race 
 Till Kingdom come and I see His face 
 Step by step 
 Day by day 
 It's a long walk home 
 But I know the Way 
 And I will run, run, run this old race 
 Till Kingdom come and I see His face

I'm broken down 
 I'm on my knees 
 I'm crying out in my disease 
 I'm so worn down 
 So won't You speak 
 And tell me how 
 You care for me? 
 'Cause You are God 
 You heal all things 
 Your name is Love 
 So Love, heal me 
 I'm broken now 
 Won't always be 
 Yes, I've seen pain 
 I've seen grief 
 But how it fades 
 When I sing 
 These songs of love: 
 They help me see that 
 You are God 
 You heal all things 
 Your name is Love 
 So Love heal me 
 And I'll hold on 
 'Cause You heal all things 
 Your name is Love 
 So Love, heal me 
 I'm falling down 
 I'm on my knees 
 I'm singin' out: You're what I need 
 I'm singin' out: You're what I need 
 I'm seeing now You're here with me

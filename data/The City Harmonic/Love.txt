Love seems like such a tricky thing 
 It can find us in the gutter 
 And it can make us feel like kings 
 I could give away the whole wide world 
 But if I never had it 
 I never really had a thing 
 God is love 
 God is love 
 God is love 
 Love, love is patient, love is kind 
 Love it doesn't envy 
 Love it never suffers pride 
 It doesn't keep your wrongs in mind 
 Cause He is not the selfish type 
 Yeah you know that's love 
 God is love 
 God is love 
 God is love 
 Whoa 
 Love, love's the truth 
 Follows through 
 And won't give up 
 Love will not lose 
 And someday soon 
 I'll see the face of love 
 God is love 
 God is love 
 God is love 
 God is love

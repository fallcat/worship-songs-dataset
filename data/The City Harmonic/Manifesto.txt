We believe in the one true God 
 We believe in Father Spirit Son 
 We believe that good has won 
 And all of the people of God sing along 
 Amen 
 We are free He died and lives again 
 We will be a people free from sin 
 Well be free a kingdom with no end 
 And all of the people of God sing along 
 Amen 
 Our father who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name 
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done 
 On earth as it is in heaven. 
 Give us our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses 
 As we forgive those who have trespassed against us 
 Lord lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil 
 For thine Is the kingdom, power and the glory forever 
 We're singing 
 Amen.

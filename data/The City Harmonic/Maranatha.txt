Breathe 
 Breathe it in 
 Feel your heart beat again 
 Here we are, here I stand with you 
 To begin to be whole, 
 To belong, to be known 
 To believe, we become new 
 The promise of a kingdom come 
 The pow'r of sin by Christ undone for 
 Christ has come and Christ is coming 
 Rise and sing - Maranatha! 
 Rise all rise, the King is coming 
 So we sing: Maranatha, Kingdom Come! 
 Rise, take a hand 
 Leave our lines in the sand 
 Undivided we stand tall 
 For we sinners, a place 
 Round this table of saints 
 Bread and wine, signs of grace for all 
 The promise of a kingdom come 
 The pow'r of sin by Christ undone for 
 Christ has come and Christ is coming 
 Rise and sing - Maranatha! 
 Rise all rise, the King is coming 
 So we sing: Maranatha, Kingdom Come! 
 For the trenches we make of city streets 
 (Maranatha) 
 For the dark and the light at war in me 
 (Maranatha) 
 For the heavy of heart and the hanging on 
 (Maranatha) 
 For the widowed wife and the orphaned one 
 (Maranatha) 
 For the world He so loved, He gave the Son 
 (Maranatha) 
 Sing 
 Christ has come and Christ is coming 
 Rise and sing - Maranatha! 
 Rise all rise, the King is coming 
 So we sing: Maranatha, Kingdom Come!

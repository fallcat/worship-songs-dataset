The valley low that's where we'll make our homes 
 But this I know that's what He saved us from 
 'Cause we've seen the glory of our King 
 On the mountaintop 
 We've been to the mountaintop 
 We've seen the glory of our God 
 He is here in the valley low 
 He's here I feel it in my bones 
 Our God here and now 
 We are the body of our God 
 Oh I've done bad, what happens to me now 
 I know for sure that we've been changed somehow 
 And we'll be the glory of our King 
 In His kingdom come 
 We've been to the mountaintop 
 We've seen the glory of our God 
 He is here in the valley low 
 He's here I feel it in my bones 
 Our God here and now 
 We are the body of our God 
 We build our temples 
 We build our walls 
 But they can't hold Him in 
 We are the temple of our God 
 But we can't hold Him in 
 We've been to the mountaintop 
 We've seen the glory of our God 
 He is here in the valley low 
 He's here I feel it in my bones 
 Our God here and now 
 We are the body of our God 
 Hey!

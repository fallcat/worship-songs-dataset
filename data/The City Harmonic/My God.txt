I lift my eyes up in these days of trouble 
 Will my help come from You? 
 And if I stumble will You pick me up? 
 What else could a Father do? 
 Well, You know just where I'm going 
 You made the open road 
 So take my hand, Lord 
 Lead me home 
 Oh, oh, my God, oh, oh, my God 
 I lift my heart up, whether it's whole or broken 
 Good God I know You're gonna work it out 
 So on my heart beats to a beat 
 That I put my hope in, the love of my God pouring out 
 Oh, oh, my God, oh, oh, my God 
 I will sing, sing, sing and You will be my song 
 I'm gonna sing it like it's everything to me 
 I'm gonna sing it like the deep calling out to deep 
 I'm gonna sing it like it's all I've got 
 'Cause all that I want is to sing for the love of God 
 I'm gonna sing it like it's everything to me 
 I'm gonna sing it like the deep calling out to deep 
 I'm gonna sing it like it's all I've got 
 'Cause all that I want is to sing, sing, sing

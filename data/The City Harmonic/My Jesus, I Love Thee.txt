My Jesus, I love Thee I know Thou art mine 
 For Thee all the follies of sin I resign 
 My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou 
 If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now 
 I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me 
 And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree 
 I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow 
 If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now 
 I love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death 
 And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath 
 And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow: 
 If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now. 
 In mansions of glory and endless delight 
 I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright 
 I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow: 
 If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now

From heav'n to us You came in love 
 Reaching down although we'd turned our hearts 
 In sacrifice You gave Your Son 
 Over to death our sins to wash away 
 In this sacrifice displayed 
 All the beauty of unending love 
 There's so much that I could say 
 And yet these simple words are rising up: 
 Father, oh what love 
 Fully man and fully God 
 A Great High Priest upon a throne of grace 
 And in this priesthood I am one 
 By grace restored to bow before You now 
 For on that cross one final cry 
 You traded purity for all my shame 
 The Son of God for man to die 
 And even then, I know You knew my name 
 Jesus, oh what love 
 Nothing can separate us from Your love 
 No mountain high, no valley low 
 How high, how deep, how wide 
 The love of God 
 More love than I have ever known

Here I stand, at the cross 
 Wholly saved in the Holy One 
 Body, mind, heart and soul 
 One 
 Here You are, Father God 
 In the Spirit and through the Son 
 The Lord Our God, the Lord is One 
 One 
 O Lord our God: Three-In-One 
 Holy Father Spirit Son 
 Make us one as You are One 
 Here we are, many parts 
 One in Spirit and of one heart 
 The body of the living God 
 One 
 Make us one as You are One

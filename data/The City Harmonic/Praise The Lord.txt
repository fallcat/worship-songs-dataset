Praise the Lord when it comes out easy 
 Praise the Lord on top of the world 
 Praise the Lord 'cause in every moment Jesus Christ is Lord 
 Even in the middle of the joys of life 
 There is always grace enough today to 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Won't you praise the Lord? 
 Praise the Lord with the world on your shoulders 
 Praise the Lord when it seems too hard 
 Praise the Lord 'cause in every moment Jesus Christ is Lord 
 Even in the middle of the long, dark night 
 There is always grace enough today to 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Won't you praise the Lord? 
 Praise the Lord if you can sing it at the top of your lungs 
 Praise the Lord like every moment is a song to be sung 
 Praise the Lord: though it might take blood, sweat and tears in your eyes 
 There is grace for today so praise the Lord 
 There is grace for today so praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Praise the Lord 
 Won't you praise the Lord? 
 There is grace for today so praise the Lord

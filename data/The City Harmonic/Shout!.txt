Burst into new song 
 Sing out in wide-eyed wonder 
 Look at what He's done 
 For you and I and all the earth 
 Stained glass and steeples 
 From Cairo to California 
 A portrait of people 
 Painted by the grace of God 
 (Shout!) 
 Strike up the band 
 Shake the ground, let's shout 
 The streets they will ring with the sound 
 Let's shout! 
 There's joy in the noise as we bring 
 Our praise to the King 
 Our praise to the king 
 (Shout!) 
 Strike up the band 
 Shake the ground, let's shout 
 The streets they will ring with the sound 
 Let's shout! 
 There's joy in the noise as we bring 
 Our praise to the King 
 Our praise to the king 
 Roar with the ocean 
 Cheer with the raging river 
 Move with the mountains 
 Dancing in their jubilee 
 We've all been waiting 
 For the grand finale 
 Creatures, creation 
 Echoing in harmony 
 (Shout!) 
 Strike up the band 
 Shake the ground, let's shout 
 The streets they will ring with the sound 
 Let's shout! 
 There's joy in the noise as we bring 
 Our praise to the King 
 Our praise to the king 
 (Shout!) 
 Strike up the band 
 Shake the ground, let's shout 
 The streets they will ring with the sound 
 Let's shout! 
 There's joy in the noise as we bring 
 Our praise to the King 
 Our praise to the King 
 He saved us from ourselves and then 
 He saved us from our sin 
 He saved the world from end to end 
 Made peace again 
 Forever 
 (Shout!) 
 Strike up the band 
 Shake the ground, let's shout 
 The streets they will ring with the sound 
 Let's shout! 
 There's joy in the noise as we bring 
 Our praise to the King 
 Our praise to the King 
 (Shout!) 
 Strike up the band 
 Shake the ground, let's shout 
 The streets they will ring with the sound 
 Let's shout! 
 There's joy in the noise as we bring 
 Our praise to the King 
 Our praise to the King

All of the best-laid plans of mice and men 
 So often go astray 
 And all the plots and schemes of kings and queens 
 Shift like the wind that blows away 
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame of man 
 But in the name of Jesus 
 Christ, the Solid Rock I am standing on 
 Through the pouring rain 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 Christ, the Solid Rock I am standing on 
 I am here to stay 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 If I'm poor as dirt and left with empty hands 
 I am still rich beyond my dreams 
 'Cause all the other ground is sinking sand, 
 Yes, I've got everything I need 
 Christ, the Solid Rock I am standing on 
 Through the pouring rain 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 Christ, the Solid Rock I am standing on 
 I am here to stay 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 I won't be afraid of the dark 
 When You light the stars in the sky 
 Yes, I will cling to the foot of the cross 
 'Cause my Solid Rock is alive! 
 Oh 
 On Christ the Solid Rock I stand 
 All other ground is sinking sand 
 On Christ the Solid Rock I stand 
 All other ground is sinking sand 
 Christ, the Solid Rock I am standing on 
 Through the pouring rain 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 Christ, the Solid Rock I am standing on 
 I am here to stay 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 No, I won't be afraid 
 No, I won't be afraid

Could a spark of Your love 
 Light a fire in me? 
 Just a spark, warm my cold heart 
 It's the living that breathe 
 When I breathe in hope 
 And breathe in grace and breathe in God 
 Then I'll breathe out peace 
 And breathe out justice, breathe out love 
 Oh, this little light's gonna shine 
 With just a spark light a fire 
 Just a spark 
 Could a spark of Your love 
 Light the whole church on fire? 
 When we care for our neighbor 
 More than we care for style? 
 When we breathe in hope 
 And breathe in grace, breathe in God 
 Yeah, we'll breathe out peace 
 And breathe out justice, breathe out love 
 Oh, this little light's gonna shine 
 With just a spark light a fire 
 Just a spark 
 Just a spark could change my heart 
 Just a spark, come change my heart 
 Just a spark is just a start 
 Light a fire in my heart 
 Light a fire here in my heart 
 Light a fire in my heart 
 Light a fire in my heart 
 A fire in my heart, with just a spark

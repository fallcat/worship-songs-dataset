For all my burning and desire 
 I can't find You in the flame 
 For all the shaking up I've tried 
 I can't find You in the quake 
 Oh for all my running in circles 
 What have I become but a little tired? 
 Hush, I'll wait for 
 You-be with me through it all 
 You-Spirit speak, still and small 
 For all the hot air that I blow 
 I can't find You in the wind 
 For all the things I think I know 
 I know less than when I began 
 And oh for all my running in circles 
 What have I become but a little tired? 
 Hush, I'll wait for 
 You-be with me through it all 
 You-Spirit speak, still and small 
 Oh for all my running in circles 
 What have I become but a little tired? 
 On and on and on and on 
 And Oh for all my running in circles 
 What have I become but a little tired? 
 Hush now wait 
 For a moment, still and small 
 And I hear You say, "Hush, now, wait"

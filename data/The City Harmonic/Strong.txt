Lord, let there be light in the dark 
 I need a silver line in the storm 
 And suddenly I can see when it rains it pours 
 But every single drop is dripping with Your love 
 Your love 
 When I am weak You're strong 
 Your grace is all I've got 
 What love is this that loves no matter what? 
 Your love, Your love, my God 
 If I can't see the light through the pain 
 Tell me how a thorn could ever be grace! 
 And suddenly You let me see in Your crown of thorns 
 That though there might be pain You'll roll the stone away, my God. 
 When I am weak You're strong 
 Your grace is all I've got 
 What love is this that loves no matter what? 
 Your love, Your love, my God 
 Your grace is sufficient for yesterday's sorrows 
 Your grace is sufficient for my right now 
 Your grace is sufficient for what may come tomorrow 
 Your strength is made perfect in this somehow 
 When I am weak You're strong 
 Your grace is all I've got 
 What love is this that loves no matter what? 
 Your love, Your love, my God

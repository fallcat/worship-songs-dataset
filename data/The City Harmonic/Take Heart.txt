I'm lost in a moment of doubt 
 'Cause my whole world is turning upside-down 
 But I built my house on the rock: 
 Though wind and waves both storm and rage 
 I'll stand my ground 
 With a hope that hopes through thick and thin 
 With a hope that knows it's bound to win 
 This hope I find it in Your heart 
 And a whole world of trouble can't tear us apart 
 Moments come and moments fade 
 But Your unending love remains 
 It might be dark but I'm not afraid 
 Dawn's about to break: 
 Take heart 
 I'm found in a moment of truth: 
 This old world and all creation longs for You 
 And I am a child of God: 
 Free in name, not free from pain 
 And I'm longing too 
 With a hope that hopes through thick and thin 
 With a hope that knows it's bound to win 
 This hope I find it in Your heart 
 And a whole world of trouble can't tear us apart. 
 Moments come and moments fade 
 But Your unending love remains 
 It might be dark but I'm not afraid 
 Dawn's about to break: 
 Take heart 
 Moments come and moments fade 
 But Your unending love remains 
 It might be dark but I'm not afraid 
 'Cause I know dawn's about to break: 
 The Son of God, You calm the seas 
 That rage inside the heart of me 
 The heart of God is what I need 
 You've overcome the world 
 Take heart 
 So I take heart.

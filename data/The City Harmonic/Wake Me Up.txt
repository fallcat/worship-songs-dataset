How long, how long will the river run dry? 
 'Cause I'm so busy living I forgot to be alive 
 And I've lost count of the beat of Your heart 
 Come on, come on, won't You wake me up? 
 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, yeah 
 'Cause when You sound 
 You bring to life 
 Even my darkest of nights 
 Wake me up to shine, oh 
 Yeah, I've come home like a prodigal son 
 If home's where the heart is that is in the hands of God 
 And that is just where my heart belongs 
 Turn on the light, come on wake me up 
 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, yeah 
 'Cause when You sound 
 You bring to life 
 Even my darkest of nights 
 You wake me up to shine, oh 
 Sleep will last from the dead 
 Sing Your songs instead 
 Right up to the end 
 Come on wake up 
 Sing out Your songs of life 
 In Your darkest nights 
 It will be alright 
 Come on wake up, wake up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 Wake me up, up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 Wake me up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 Wake, wake me up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 Wake, wake me up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 Wake, wake me up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 Wake, wake me up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 Wake, wake me up 
 You gotta wake me up 
 You shine 
 You bring to life 
 Even my darkest of nights 
 You wake me up to shine

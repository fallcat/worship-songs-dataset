Ash to ash, dust to dust 
 We live and die. 
 But in the Son, in the Son 
 We are alive. 
 All for one, all for one 
 From every tongue and tribe 
 In Jesus crucified 
 'Cause Jesus is alive 
 Now, once and for all time. 
 We are one 
 We are all for one. 
 All for Jesus 
 Jesus, once for all. 
 To the glory of the one true God 
 King of kings, Lord of lords 
 Till kingdom come. 
 And in the end, in the end 
 God all in all. 
 He will be everything, 
 Everything to everyone, 
 When death is finally done 
 And victory is won, 
 Once and for all of us. 
 We are one 
 We are all for one. 
 All for Jesus. 
 Jesus, once for all. 
 To the glory of the one true God 
 We won't be moved, we're standing tall. 
 Once of the dust, now of the Son. 
 All life and death and what's to come 
 Belong to Christ, and Christ to God. 
 So here we stand, hands lifted high. 
 The very hands and feet of Christ. 
 No holding back, no wasting time. 
 We live for love 
 For we are one. 
 We are all for one. 
 All for Jesus. 
 Jesus, once for all. 
 To the glory of the one true God. 
 We are one. 
 We are all for one. 
 All for Jesus. 
 Jesus once for all. 
 To the glory of the one true God.

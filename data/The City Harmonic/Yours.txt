I give my heart up in my empty hands 
 And as I look it's like 
 I see the sum of who I am 
 All my hopes, all my dreams, all my thoughts 
 And the things I love 
 All my sin, all my fear 
 All my sorry's for the things I've done 
 You can have it all, it's Yours 
 All of it Yours, all of it Yours, all of it Yours 
 Yours, all of it Yours 
 All of it Yours, all of it Yours 
 I give my days up like grains of sand 
 And as I look it's like 
 I see the sum of who I've been 
 Every hour that I stole 
 Every hour I lived like a saint 
 Every day, every dollar 
 Washed away into a sea of grace 
 And You can have it all, it's Yours 
 All of it Yours, all of it Yours, all of it Yours 
 Yours, all of it Yours 
 All of it Yours, all of it Yours, ooh 
 I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours 
 I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours 
 I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours 
 I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours, ooh

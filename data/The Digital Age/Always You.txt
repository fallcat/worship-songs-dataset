Rise 
 Awake oh sun 
 Rise 
 Who fills the world with light 
 It's always You 
 It's always You 
 It's always You 
 It's always You 
 Rise 
 Awake oh sun 
 Rise 
 Who brings the Earth to life 
 It's always You 
 It's always You 
 It's always You 
 It's always You 
 (It's always You) 
 I will bend but I won't break 
 God steal my heart it's Yours to take 
 The same Love that has captured me 
 Is the same Love that has set me free 
 Jesus it is always You 
 Jesus it is always You 
 It's always You

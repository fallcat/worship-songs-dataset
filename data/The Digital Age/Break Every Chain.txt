There is power in the name of Jesus 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 To break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 You're the all sufficient sacrifice 
 So freely given such a price 
 Bought our redemption 
 Heaven's gates swing wide 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 To break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 To break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 There's an army rising up 
 There's an army rising up 
 There's an army rising up 
 To break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 There is power in the name of Jesus 
 To break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 To break every chain 
 Break every chain 
 Break every chain

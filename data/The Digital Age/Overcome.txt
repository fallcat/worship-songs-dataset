I can hear the roar it's a mighty sound 
 Your love is an avalanche 
 I'm overcome, I'm overcome 
 With a crash I'm tumbling down 
 I'm wildly moved 
 I'm overcome, I'm overcome 
 By Your grace 
 Your love 
 Your peace 
 You're enough 
 You're all I need 
 Everything 
 I could want 
 Is found in Your love 
 I'm taken away by a river of peace 
 On this starlit night 
 I'm overcome, I'm overcome 
 I'm lost in the glow of Your majesty 
 Oh my God how You captivate 
 I'm overcome, I'm overcome 
 By Your grace 
 Your love 
 Your peace 
 You're enough 
 You're all I need 
 Everything 
 I could want 
 Is found in Your love 
 Your love 
 Your love 
 Your love 
 Like a snowfall that blankets the Earth 
 My sin has been covered 
 And I'm overcome, I'm overcome 
 The price has been paid 
 The war's already won 
 The blood of my Savior was shed 
 He's overcome 
 And I'm overcome 
 By Your grace 
 Your love 
 Your peace 
 You're enough 
 You're all I need 
 Everything 
 I could want 
 Is found in Your love 
 Your love 
 Your love 
 You're all I need 
 Everything 
 I could want 
 Is found in Your love

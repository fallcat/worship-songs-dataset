I will stand and shout it 
 Oh I will sing forever 
 For my King has come 
 And He's coming again 
 I will stand and shout it 
 Oh I will sing forever 
 For my King has come 
 And He's coming again 
 Sing it out 
 Sing it out 
 Praise be to God 
 Who has set me free 
 In a symphony of grace 
 Praise be to God 
 Who has set me free 
 In a symphony of grace 
 Oh I will sing it 
 I will stand and shout it 
 With everything sing praises 
 For my King has come 
 And He's coming again 
 I will stand and shout it 
 With everything sing praises 
 For my King has come 
 And He's coming again 
 Sing it out 
 Sing it out 
 Praise be to God 
 Who has set me free 
 In a symphony of grace 
 Praise be to God 
 Who has set me free 
 In a symphony of grace 
 Oh I will shout it 
 I've never been louder 
 With everything in me 
 I'm joining the symphony 
 Oh I will shout it 
 I've never been louder 
 With everything in me 
 I'm joining the symphony 
 I will stand and shout it 
 Oh I will sing forever 
 For my King has come 
 And He's coming again 
 I will stand and shout it 
 Oh I will sing forever 
 For my King has come 
 And He's coming again 
 Praise be to God 
 Who has set me free 
 In a symphony of grace

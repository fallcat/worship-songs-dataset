All the old will be made new 
 And all the lost will be found in You 
 Hope arise 
 Hope arise 
 And all that's dead will come to life 
 And all the dark will be turned to light 
 Hope arise 
 Hope arise 
 We shout, we shout 
 Your name across the universe 
 Aloud, aloud 
 The sound of Heaven will be heard 
 And all that is within us shouts 
 All that is within us shouts Your name 
 And all the wounded will hurt no more 
 And all creation knocks at Your door 
 Hope arise 
 Hope arise 
 We shout, we shout 
 Your name across the universe 
 Aloud, aloud 
 The sound of Heaven will be heard 
 And all that is within us shouts 
 All that is within us shouts Your name 
 We cannot contain, not contain Your glory 
 Heaven open wide, open wide 
 We are reaching out, we have found Your freedom 
 Heaven is alive, is alive 
 We shout, we shout 
 Your name across the universe 
 Aloud, aloud, aloud 
 We shout, we shout 
 Your name across the universe 
 Aloud, aloud 
 The sound of Heaven will be heard 
 And all that is within us shouts 
 All that is within us shouts Your name 
 Your name

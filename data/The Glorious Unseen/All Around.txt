When my world is caving in 
 When my hopes are wearing thin 
 When I'm choking in my sin 
 Lord, You meet me here 
 When all around is crashing down 
 I find myself alive in You, Holy One, renew 
 When all around is crashing down 
 I find my spirit crying out, Holy One, consume 
 When I listen to the fear 
 When I feel my end is near 
 When all hope has disappeared 
 Lord, You meet me here 
 When all around is crashing down 
 I find myself alive in You, Holy One, renew 
 When all around is crashing down 
 I find my spirit crying out, Holy One, consume 
 Will You pour out again? 
 God of mercy, here I am 
 Reaching out to You 
 Reaching out for a breakthrough 
 Father, hear my cry 
 Of desperation once again 
 I look into Your eyes 
 And know a love that has no end 
 Oh, Your love has no end, oh Lord 
 Will You pour out? 
 And so will You pour out? 
 When all around is crashing down 
 I find myself alive in You, Holy One, renew 
 When all around is crashing down 
 I find my spirit crying out, Holy One, consume 
 Consume, consume

Have You turned your face from us? 
 Have we hurt You far too much? 
 Do You still look down in love? 
 Is Your grace still strong enough? 
 God, we would ask that Your kingdom would come 
 And be poured out on earth as we stand here in awe 
 God, hear our cry for awakening here 
 Will You take away pain? Will You take away fear, Lord? 
 Is Your love for us in vain? 
 Do You look at us in shame? 
 Do You hear when we curse Your name? 
 And how can You still love us the same? 
 God, we would ask that Your kingdom would come 
 And be poured out on earth as we stand here in awe 
 God, hear our cry for awakening here 
 Will You take away pain? Will You take away fear? 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

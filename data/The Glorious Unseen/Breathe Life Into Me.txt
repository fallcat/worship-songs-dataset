God of the broken, God of the weak 
 Be a light in my darkness, breathe life into me 
 Father, come speak Your truth, I offer my life 
 I give it to You, Lord take from me all my unbelief 
 Where are You when I feel alone? 
 When I try to find arms that are strong enough to hold 
 All that I am and ever will be I give unto You, oh Jesus, my King 
 God of all comfort 
 I'm wrecked and I'm torn 
 Would You use me in weakness? 
 Would You speak to this storm? 
 Where are You when I feel alone? 
 When I try to find arms that are strong enough to hold 
 All that I am and ever will be I give unto You, oh Jesus, my King 
 All that You are is all that I need 
 Father release, release Yourself please 
 My spirit is at war with a dark enemy 
 Oh Lord, will You come breathe life into me? 
 Breathe life into me, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Breathe life, breathe life, breathe life, breathe life 
 Come breathe life into me, oh Jesus, oh Jesus 
 Where are You when I feel alone? 
 When I try to find arms that are strong enough to hold 
 All that I am and ever will be I give unto You, oh Jesus, my King

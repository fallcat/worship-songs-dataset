Fire of God 
 Burn in me 
 Capture my heart again 
 Pull me through 
 Make me clean 
 I'm reaching for your love 
 Come carry me now 
 I'm crying out 
 For someone I can not see 
 Come carry me now 
 I'm crying 
 How I long to be broken 
 How I want to be near you 
 How my heart skips beats when 
 Your love accepts me as I am 
 Breathe of God 
 Breath on me 
 Hold me in your hands 
 Take my life 
 This offering 
 And use me where I am 
 Come carry me now 
 I'm crying out 
 For someone I can not see 
 Come carry me now 
 I'm crying 
 How I long to be broken 
 How I want to be near you 
 How my heart skips beats when 
 Your love accepts me as I am 
 How I long to be broken 
 How I want to be near you 
 How my heart skips beats when 
 Your love accepts me as I am 
 Come burn in me 
 Come burn in me 
 Come burn in me 
 Burn in me

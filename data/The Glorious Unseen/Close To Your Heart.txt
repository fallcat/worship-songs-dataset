You look down from Heaven 
 And melt me with Your gaze 
 Then You come down from Heaven 
 And wrap me in Your wings 
 And it makes me feel loved again 
 So close in Your arms 
 And it makes me feel home again 
 So close to Your heart 
 Ooh Lord, so close to Your heart God 
 So close to Your heart God 
 So close to Your heart 
 I'm so close to Your heart God 
 Come draw me into You 
 I'm so close to Your heart God 
 Here I am God 
 Draw me into You, ooh

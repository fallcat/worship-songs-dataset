We expect the best and nothing less from You, 
 But will we embrace 
 The suffering too as part of Your plan for us, oh Lord? 
 You hold my hand and whisper in my ear of how 
 You're longing to be near 
 And how, my pain, You feel it too. 
 Here I stand, securely, resting in Your presence, waiting on Your voice. 
 Hold my hand as I walk through the valley of the shadow, 
 Embracing the call again. 
 You pull me close and hold me in Your arms, 
 And show me how Your love is strong, 
 That never leaves when I'm alone

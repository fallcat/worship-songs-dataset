Don't wake me, I've fallen asleep 
 Don't hate me, I have no relief 
 This burden is shredding my soul 
 This cycle is out of control 
 And You call me as Your friend 
 As I drive these nails again, I'm falling into You 
 You call me as Your friend 
 As I break Your heart again, I'm falling into You 
 In a darkened room this pain is complete 
 In my selfish tomb I smell the defeat 
 Why do I medicate? Why do I go back to the things I hate? 
 There's something broken in me, I must be soaking in my apathy 
 And You call me as Your friend 
 As I drive these nails again, I'm falling into You 
 You call me as Your friend 
 As I break Your heart again, I'm falling into You 
 All who are found in this place 
 Come to the ocean of grace 
 And all who have spit in His face 
 Come and live 
 And You call me as Your friend 
 As I drive these nails again, I'm falling into You 
 You call me as Your friend 
 As I break Your heart again, I'm falling into You 
 When You call me as Your friend 
 My heart beats once again, I'm falling into You 
 You call me as Your friend 
 And I come alive again, I'm falling into You 
 Into You, I'm falling into You

God, You stand when all has fallen. 
 You embrace the long forgotten. 
 I guess it's just hard to believe the grace You pour out on me. 
 I guess I'm just starting to see how You're working in me. 
 This is what makes my head spin. 
 You're forever holy. 
 God of all creation, pour Your life into me. 
 This is so overwhelming. 
 You're forever holy. 
 God of my salvation, clothe me in Your glory. 
 God, You hold when all is breaking. 
 You restore the tired and aching. 
 I guess it's just hard to believe the love You pour out on me. 
 I guess I'm just starting to see how You're working in me.

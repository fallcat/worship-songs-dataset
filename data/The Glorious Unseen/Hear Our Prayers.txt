Hear our cries Lord, 
 Hear our prayers. 
 Take our burdens, 
 Calm our fears. 
 God will you make us 
 A people that love You. 
 Please take our offerings 
 That we set before You. 
 God hear our prayers 
 That we're lifting up to You. 
 God see our tears 
 That we're struggling to see through. 
 God, hear our prayers to You. 
 In our weakness, 
 You remain. 
 When we're broken, 
 You sustain. 
 God will you make us 
 A people that love You. 
 Please take our offerings 
 That we set before You. 
 God hear our prayers 
 That we're lifting up to You. 
 God see our tears 
 That we're struggling to see through. 
 God hear our prayers. 
 We lift them to You. 
 God hear our prayers, 
 Lord make our hearts true. 
 Will You make our hearts true? 
 Hear our prayers Lord. 
 God will you make us 
 A people that love You. 
 Please take our offerings 
 That we set before You. 
 God hear our prayers 
 That we're lifting up to You. 
 God see our tears 
 That we're struggling to see through. 
 God hear our prayers 
 As we lift them to heaven. 
 We're praying the angels 
 Receive and embrace them. 
 The hopes of the empty, 
 The cries of the broken. 
 We're reaching our hands out, 
 Oh Lord will You hold them?

What is the meaning of grace 
 When it speaks to my darkest place? 
 Why do I always feel like I'm Your disgrace? 
 I'm sick of saving face 
 And when I feel so heavyhearted I know You're taking me back 
 And when You take me as I am it's like the sunlight gracing the land 
 And when I feel heavyhearted please come and take my hand 
 Heavyhearted again 
 Where is the message of hope 
 When I'm sick and I'm all alone? 
 Why do I listen to doubt? Why do I shut You out? 
 You're what I need the most 
 And though I feel so heavyhearted I know You're taking me back 
 And when You take me as I am it's like the sunlight gracing the land 
 And when I feel heavyhearted please come and take my hand 
 Heavyhearted again, heavyhearted 
 It's so crazy, how You sustain me 
 When I am down in the dirt You come and claim me 
 Father, Your burden is light, I need Your love tonight 
 I'm reaching out to You 
 And when You take me as I am it's like the sunlight gracing the land 
 And when I feel heavyhearted please come and take my hand 
 Heavyhearted again 
 And when You take me as I am it's like the sunlight gracing the land 
 And when I feel heavyhearted please come and take my hand 
 Heavyhearted again, I'm heavyhearted again 
 I'm heavyhearted again but so close to You

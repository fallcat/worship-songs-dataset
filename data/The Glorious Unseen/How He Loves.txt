Oh, how He loves us so 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 How He loves us so 
 He is jealous for me, He loves like a hurricane 
 I am a tree bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy 
 When all of a sudden I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory 
 And I realize just how beautiful You are 
 And how great Your affections are for me 
 And oh, how He loves us so 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 How He loves us so 
 He loves us so, He loves us so 
 He loves us, oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us, oh, how He loves 
 We are His portion, He is our prize 
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes 
 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking 
 Then heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss 
 My heart turns violently inside of my chest 
 And I don't have time to maintain these regrets when I think about the way 
 He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves 
 Yeah, He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 Oh, how He loves 
 And oh, how He loves us so 
 Oh, how He loves us 
 How He loves us so

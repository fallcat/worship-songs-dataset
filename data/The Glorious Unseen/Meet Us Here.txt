Lord we cry 
 Meet us here 
 Change our hearts 
 Bring us near 
 And we come to this place God 
 And offer up our hearts 
 We're holding to Your promise that 
 You'll meet us where we are 
 We come broken in sin 
 For yet You still call our names 
 And Your Glory surrounds us 
 And brings us to our knees 
 Lord we cry, will you meet us here 
 Meet us here 
 Lord we bow 
 In Your name 
 Saved by Grace 
 Cleansed in blood 
 And we come to this place God 
 And offer up our hearts 
 We're holding to Your promise that 
 You'll meet us where we are 
 We come broken and sin 
 For yet You still call our names 
 And Your Glory surrounds us 
 And brings us to our knees 
 Lord we cry, will you meet us here 
 As we're calling on Your name 
 Come and meet us here 
 As we're falling on our knees before You 
 Reaching out for all Your Love 
 We're on our knees reaching for You 
 Father meet us here 
 Come and meet us here 
 Spirit meet us 
 Spirit meet us here

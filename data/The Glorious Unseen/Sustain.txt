Cover me, there's a battlefield ahead 
 Cover me, there's an enemy that wants to have my head 
 Why do You let evil have its way? 
 How can You let orphans die in vain? 
 When will You give answers for the pain? 
 Is there a place where hope can still sustain? 
 Where hope can still sustain 
 Cover me as I walk this out alone 
 As I search deserted streets for a place to call my own 
 I've wandered over all the earth like an angel without wings 
 I'm a song without a voice, I'm a ghost without a grave 
 Why do You let evil have its way? 
 How can You let orphans die in vain? 
 When will You give answers for the pain? 
 Is there a place where hope can still sustain? 
 Where hope can still sustain 
 So please come take the burdens that have held me down so long, so long 
 And if I scream Your name again will You reach my bloody hands? 
 God, I'm holding on to You for You can make me new 
 If I scream Your name again will You reach my bloody hands? 
 God, I'm holding to Your arms, I've been holding on so long 
 If I scream Your name again will You reach my bloody hands? 
 God, I'm holding on to You for You can make me new 
 I've been holding on so long 
 If I scream Your name again will You reach my bloody hands? 
 God, I'm holding on to You for You can make me new 
 I've been holding on so long

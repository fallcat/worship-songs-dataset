Oh Lord, come whisper to me in my sleep 
 Come pour Yourself out over me 
 Will You draw near? 
 Oh Lord, You're calling me back to your heart 
 Restoring the innocence lost 
 Will You draw near? I pray 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Oh Lord, remember Your call to Your own 
 Remember Your promise to come 
 Will you draw near? 
 So come pour Your life, oh, this offering all over me 
 Come with Your grace that is cleansing and restoring me 
 Come with Your angels, cover the earth 
 And hear Your people sing of Your worth 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 And it's Your voice I hear calling my name 
 And it's Your grace that pours out like the rain 
 And it's Your hand that erases my shame 
 And it's Your word that is everlasting 
 We lift our voice to You 
 A sweet, sweet sound in Your ear Jesus, Jesus 
 We raise our voice to You 
 With one sound to You we rejoice 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound

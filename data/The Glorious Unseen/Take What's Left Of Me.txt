When my hope is gone how can I carry on? 
 And if my faith is strong will You be the truth I'm hanging on? 
 Will You be my eyes when I cannot see? 
 Will You be my voice when I cannot speak? 
 Will You be my hands where I cannot reach? 
 Father, take what's left of me 
 Will You take what's left of me? 
 And if I fall away will You come rescue me? 
 And in my broken state will You be a light to guide my way? 
 Will You be my eyes when I cannot see? 
 Will You be my voice when I cannot speak? 
 Will You be my hands where I cannot reach? 
 Father, take what's left of me 
 Will You take me back to that place again? 
 Where I know my Savior as my friend 
 Where You show me grace that has no end 
 Where I come alive within Your plan 
 Will you take me there? 
 Will You be my eyes when I cannot see? 
 Will You be my voice when I cannot speak? 
 Will You be my hands where I cannot reach? 
 Father, take what's left of me 
 Take what's left, take what's left of me, oh Lord 
 Will You take, will You take what's left? 
 Oh Lord, take me, take me 
 Will You take what's left? 
 Take what's left, oh Lord

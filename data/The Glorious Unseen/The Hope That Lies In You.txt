We can hear the sound of all creation sing 
 A song to heal the earth, a song to spark a dream 
 Where are you optimists? We need your strength in this 
 There's a stirring in your soul that cannot be controlled 
 This is the hope that lies in You 
 We can hear the sound of all the earth rejoice 
 With angels all around lifting up their voice 
 Where are you hopeful ones? Have we come undone? 
 There's a stirring in your soul that cannot be controlled 
 This is the hope that lies in You 
 This is the hope that lies in You 
 And through all the questioning You've been the hope in me 
 Despite uncertainty You've been the only constant thing 
 And when I'm struggling You keep on loving me the same 
 This is the hope that lies in You 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 (This is the hope that lies in You) 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 (Come down, we need Your hope to come down) 
 (We need Your grace to pour out) 
 (We need Your love to shine down) 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 (Come down, we need Your hope to come down) 
 (We need Your grace to pour out) 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 (Come down, we need Your hope to come down) 
 (We need Your grace to pour out) 
 (We need the face of God now) 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah

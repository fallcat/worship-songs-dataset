Tonight the stars speak of your infinite love 
 And it serves to remind me 
 That what I have means nothing at all 
 Compared to your glory, Oh Lord 
 How long till your voice speaks clearly? 
 How long till your arms envelope me? 
 I cry be my strength when I am weak 
 Oh Lord have mercy on me please 
 My spirit is willing but my flesh is so weak 
 I cry in your arms now 
 God grant me the strength to rest in you 
 I lift my hands and cry

Without a word pain comes quietly to earth 
 Without a sound, we're infected with the hurt 
 And it's crazy how this life unfolds 
 And it's crazy how much time can show and so it goes 
 And it's falling apart, what can I do 
 After all that we've been through? 
 What of the dreams I shared with you? 
 Here's hoping that we can be renewed 
 Through all the questioning I'm still discovering myself 
 And in the processing I wonder if there's something else 
 That has a hold on me 
 What if we went back in time? Do you think we'd change our minds? 
 And it's falling apart, what can I do 
 After all that we've been through? 
 What of the dreams I shared with you? 
 Here's hoping that we renewed 
 Look what we've come through to overcome these things 
 From where we started and everything between 
 I won't abandon you, I don't have much to hold on to 
 It seems that you're so far away 
 And it's falling apart, what can I do 
 After all that we've been through? 
 What of the dreams I shared with you? 
 Here's hoping that we renewed 
 And it's falling apart, what can I do 
 After all that we've been through? 
 What of the dreams I shared with you? 
 Here's hoping that we can be renewed 
 We can be renewed

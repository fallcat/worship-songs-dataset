Holy one, we come in Your honor. 
 Show Your blessing and favor upon us. 
 Our hearts are heavy and spirits are tired. 
 But in Your glory we'll walk through the fire. 
 Bring to our lives a sense of your calling. 
 Hear our cries to be completely healed. 
 In Your eyes we'll discover the meaning of your unending grace. 
 We're desperate for a taste. 
 We're longing for the place where Your glory dwells. 
 Precious one, we bow in Your presence. 
 Hands outstretched in a holy expectance. 
 Desperately pleading for restoration to empty hearts 
 And a broken nation

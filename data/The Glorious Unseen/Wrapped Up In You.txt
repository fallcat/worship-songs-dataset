Take me to the place where You are. 
 Where my burdens fall down at Your feet. 
 Where Your spirit comes to carry me. 
 Take me away where I can be near You. 
 Where the sun is bright and warms my face, where I feel alive in Your embrace. 
 God you're all I'll ever need. 
 To be with You, 
 Will You carry me away to Your secret and Your holy place? 
 Where I'm all wrapped up in You, 
 Wrapped up in Your arms. 
 God I'm wrapped up in Your arms.

The veil's ripped away 
 We have communion 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Broken away 
 The chains that restrained me 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 With tears streaming down my face 
 I will praise you 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Show your glory, fill this place 
 Father, Teacher, God of Grace 
 When my sorrow turns to praise 
 Show your glory, Lord 
 Show your glory, Lord 
 Your promises still remain 
 Despite my imperfection 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah

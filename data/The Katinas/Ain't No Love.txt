ICan I please have 
 A few minutes of your time? 
 Come and go with me 
 I'm sure that you will find 
 That you've invested well 
 In the future of your soul 
 Love, Joy and Peace are all 
 The things that we all want 
 And I can't blame you 
 (You feel suspicious) 
 The same thing that I would do 
 (I did it) 
 So many voices (All around you) 
 A million choices 
 (But tell me what's the truth) 
 Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had 
 Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had 
 Have you taken time 
 To think about your life 
 Is there a void 
 Fill it up with Christ 
 I know you've searched yourself 
 And peace you could not find 
 Love, Joy, and Happiness 
 Tranquility of Mind 
 And I can't blame you 
 (You feel suspicious) 
 The same thing that I would do 
 (I did it) 
 So many voices (All around you) 
 A million choices 
 (But tell me what's the truth) 
 Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had 
 Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had 
 Nananananananamamamamamanamananana 
 Lalalalalalalalala 
 Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had 
 Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had Ain't no love, like the love He gives 
 There's no life, like the one I have 
 Gotta try it for yourself 
 It is better than anything 
 I know you've ever had 
 Uhhhoohooooh.

I sang a simple song of love 
 Hope You feel the same 
 When You see all my fear 
 And how I fail 
 I fall sometimes 
 It's hard to walk in shifting sand 
 I miss the rock and find 
 I've nowhere left to stand 
 I start to cry 
 Lord, please help me 
 Raise my hand, so You can pick me up 
 Hold me close, hold me tighter 
 It's safe inside 
 Your arms of love 
 Like a child who's held throughout a storm 
 You keep me warm 
 In Your arms of love 
 Storms will come and storms will go 
 Wonder just how many storms 
 It takes until I finally know 
 You're here always 
 Even when my skies are far from gray, 
 I can stay 
 Teach me to stay there

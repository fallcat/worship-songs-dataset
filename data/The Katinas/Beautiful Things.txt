All this pain 
 I wonder if I'll ever find my way? 
 I wonder if my life could really change at all? 
 All this earth 
 Could all that is lost ever be found? 
 Could a garden come up from this ground at all? 
 You make beautiful things 
 You make beautiful things out of the dust 
 You make beautiful things 
 You make beautiful things out of us 
 All around 
 Hope is springing up from this old ground 
 Out of chaos life is being found in You 
 You make beautiful things 
 You make beautiful things out of the dust 
 You make beautiful things 
 You make beautiful things out of us 
 You make me new, You are making me new 
 You make me new, You are making me new 
 Making me new 
 You make beautiful things 
 (You make me new) 
 You make beautiful things out of the dust 
 (You are making me new, making me new) 
 You make beautiful things 
 (You make me new) 
 You make beautiful things out of us 
 (You are making me new, making me new) 
 Oh, you make beautiful things 
 (You make me new) 
 You make beautiful things out of the dust 
 (You are making me new, making me new) 
 You make beautiful things 
 You make beautiful things out of the dust 
 You make me new, You are making me new 
 You make me new, You are making me new

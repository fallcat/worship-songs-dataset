I have seen Your beauty 
 I have known Your great love for me 
 I have heard Your voice whispering 
 I have felt Your hand leading me 
 But it's Your faithfulness that takes my breath away 
 And it's Your loving arms that keep me here to stay 
 Lord let me say 
 I love because You are 
 I love You because You have been 
 I love you because You will be forever faithful to me 
 You were grace to carry me 
 You were peace to comfort me 
 You are light when I can't see 
 You are strength when I am weak 
 But it's Your faithfulness that takes my breath away 
 And it's your loving arms that keep me here to stay 
 Lord let me say 
 I love because You are 
 I love You because You have been 
 I love you because You will be forever faithful to me 
 I love because You are 
 I love You because You have been 
 I love you because You will be forever faithful to me

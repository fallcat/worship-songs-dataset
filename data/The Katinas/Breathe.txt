I'm desperate for you. 
 This is the air I breathe, 
 This is the air I breathe 
 Your Holy presence living in me 
 This is my daily bread, 
 This is my daily bread 
 Your very word spoken to me 
 I, I'm desperate for you, 
 I, I'm lost without you 
 I'm lost without you 
 This is the air I breathe, 
 This is the air I breathe 
 Your holy presence living in me 
 This is my daily bread, 
 This is my daily bread 
 Your very word spoken to me 
 I, I'm desperate for you, 
 I, I'm lost without you 
 I, I'm desperate for you, 
 I, I'm lost without you 
 I'm lost without you 
 My heart cries out, I worship You 
 My heart cries out, I worship You 
 My heart cries out, I worship You

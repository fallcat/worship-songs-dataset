Come on, baby, while the moon is high 
 Kick up your heels and dance 
 Don't be nervous, don't be shy 
 And give yourself a chance 
 You can dance 
 Kick off your shoes and lose your blues 
 Pick 'em up, Lord, put 'em back down 
 And around, and around, and around, and around. 
 Come on, baby, it must be fun 
 To be dancin' in the clear moonlight 
 Otherwise, would everyone be out on 
 Such a cold and windy night? 
 We can dance. 
 Throw yourself away 
 Holy month of may 
 You can dance. 
 Listen to the music of the steel guitar 
 Don't it sound good 
 Hey now, nobody here tonight came to look at you, 
 No, no, no 
 Well I bet you five dollars that somebody starts a fire 
 Back in the woods, hey now 
 Everybody here tonight came to boogie 
 Have a good time, too 
 Come on, baby, while the moon is high 
 Kick up your heels and dance 
 Don't be nervous, don't be shy 
 And give yourself a chance 
 You can dance 
 Kick off your shoes and lose your blues 
 Pick 'em up, Lord, put 'em back down 
 And around, and around, and around, and around 
 If I could lose my mind 
 If I could throw myself away.

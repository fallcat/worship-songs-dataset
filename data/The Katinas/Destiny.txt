Have you ever had a dream about accomplishing great things? 
 And you can clearly see the invisible as reality 
 And when you start to push, to bring it to pass 
 Comfort zone people start to laugh (and question you) 
 They tell me just to slow down 
 Relax and ease my mind 
 Young man where are you going? 
 What are you trying to find? 
 But I can't sit and be still 
 I have a mission to fulfill 
 You ask me why? 
 You ask me why? 
 I'm on a mission 
 It's my destiny my purpose and design got a hold of me 
 There will be no stoppin' till I reach my goal 
 If you wanna come you better hit the road 
 It's my destiny my purpose and design got a hold of me 
 There will be no stoppin' till I reach my goal 
 If you wanna come you better hit the road (come and run with me) 
 Have you ever taken time pondering the depths of your mind? 
 And you can clearly see the invisible as reality 
 And when you start to push, to bring it to pass 
 Comfort zone people start to laugh (and ridicule you) 
 They tell me just to slow down 
 Relax and ease my mind 
 Young man where are you going? 
 What are you trying to find? 
 But I can't sit and be still 
 I have a mission to fulfill 
 You ask me why? 
 You ask me why? 
 I'm on a mission 
 My destiny 
 Is reality 
 About you and me yeah 
 It's no fantasy 
 My destiny 
 Got a hold of me gonna reach my goal 
 Better hit the road

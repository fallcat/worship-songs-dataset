Draw me close to You 
 Never let me go 
 I'd lay it all down again 
 (Oh Lord) 
 To hear You say that 
 I’m Your friend 
 You are my desire 
 No one else will do 
 'Cause nothing else 
 Could take Your place 
 (Oh, Lord, no) 
 To feel the warmth 
 Of Your embrace 
 Help me find the way 
 Bring me back to You 
 Spoken: 
 Bring me back 
 Oh 
 You know the words, just sing along 
 Jesus 
 Draw me close to You, you sing 
 Draw me close to You 
 Never let me go - spoken 
 Never let me go 
 I'd lay it all down again 
 (Yes, Lord) 
 To hear You say that 
 I’m Your friend 
 (You are my desire) 
 You are my desire 
 (No one else will do) 
 No one else will do 
 ('Cause nothing else can take Your place) 
 'Cause nothing else 
 Can take Your place 
 (Just to feel) 
 To feel the warmth 
 Of Your embrace 
 (Help me find the way) 
 Help me find the way 
 (Bring me back to You) 
 Bring me back to You

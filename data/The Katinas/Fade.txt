Take this song of Love 
 That's written 
 On my heart 
 As an offering of 
 Worship 
 Hear my cry, o Lord 
 How desperate 
 I've become 
 For your Love 
 For your love 
 You can heal me 
 With the touch 
 Or your hand 
 And it's only 
 By your mercy 
 I can come to you 
 Knowing who I am 
 And be loved 
 Still be loved 
 Fade me away 
 Let nothing 
 More remain 
 So you can 
 Take your place 
 We long to 
 Worship you 
 To honor you 
 And give you 
 All the praise 
 Fade me away... 
 That I may dwell 
 Under the shadow 
 Of your grace 
 God almighty, be my refuge 
 May the power 
 Of the cross 
 Live in me 
 Live in me 
 Fade me away 
 Let nothing 
 More remain 
 So you can 
 Take your place 
 We long to 
 Worship you 
 To honor you 
 And give you 
 All the praise 
 Fade me away... 
 Jesus my savior 
 We adore you 
 Even the angels 
 Bow before you 
 Great is the Beauty 
 Of your holiness to me... 
 Fade me away 
 Let nothing 
 More remain 
 So you can 
 Take your place 
 Fade me away 
 Make me a reflection 
 Of your radiant face 
 We long to 
 Worship you 
 To honor you 
 And give you 
 All the praise 
 Fade me away...

This ones for you Father 
 A song within my heart 
 I dedicate to honor 
 The depth of who you are 
 Every hope and treasure 
 I lay down at your feet 
 Riches can't compare to what 
 You've given to me 
 Pre Now I'm looking for a new day 
 My destiny is waiting 
 Here in this beautiful release 
 My God set me free 
 So I can clearly see 
 Your Love carried me 
 So I could live to be 
 You did it just for me 
 Blessed are the nations 
 That lift your name on high 
 The one and only perfect sacrifice 
 And all creation 
 One day will testify 
 Love so amazing that you gave your life 
 Pre Love has taken over me 
 I have been set free 
 Oh Love has taken over me 
 I have been set free

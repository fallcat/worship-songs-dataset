This is my desire, 
 To honor you 
 Lord with all my heart, 
 I worship you 
 All I have within me, 
 I give you praise 
 All that I adore 
 Is in you 
 Lord, I give you my heart, 
 I give you my soul 
 I live for you alone 
 Every breath that I take, 
 Every moment I'm awake 
 Lord have your way in me

There are moments in this life 
 When it's hard to carry on 
 When I think about my father 
 And all the loved ones that are gone 
 Friends and close relationships 
 Somewhere on the other side 
 They've passed into forever 
 But the love has never died 
 Sometimes this tired old world 
 Starts bringing my heart down 
 But you gotta bear the cross 
 If you wanna wear the crown 
 I often get impatient 
 As Father Time keeps dragging on 
 I've waded through the darkness 
 Now I'm ready for the dawn 
 I'm ready for the dawn 
 I want to see heaven 
 Where the faithful carry on 
 I want to see heaven 
 Oh Lord 
 I want to see heaven 
 Where the pain of sin is gone 
 In heaven 
 Oh Lord 
 I want to see heaven 
 As I read the morning paper 
 It hits me once again 
 We're surrounded by the evil 
 Of a world that's dead in sin 
 And the only sane conclusion 
 That my crazy mind can reach 
 Is to set my heart on heaven 
 And to live the things I preach 
 So I'm living every moment 
 As if this day was my last 
 Put my treasures where my heart is 
 And forget about the past 
 And if Jesus comes tomorrow 
 I'll be ready to depart 
 As He leads me to my mansion 
 I'll be following my heart 
 I'll be following my heart 
 I want to see heaven 
 Where the faithful carry on 
 I want to see heaven 
 Oh Lord 
 I want to see heaven 
 Where the pain of sin is gone 
 In heaven 
 Oh Lord 
 I want to see heaven 
 I've tried to go the distance 
 But it's more than I can bear 
 They say there's no more crying 
 And no more dying there 
 I've held on to the promise 
 Who so ever will believe 
 Will have life that's never ending 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I want to see heaven 
 Where the faithful carry on 
 I want to see heaven 
 Oh Lord 
 I want to see heaven 
 Where the pain of sin is gone 
 In heaven 
 Oh Lord 
 I want to see heaven

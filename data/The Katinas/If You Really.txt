 Selling every thing I got to purchase Your precious pearl 
 Make me vessel in Your Father, You love that what we're trying' 
 Take a source about the mile, Lord, I'm ready to go on high 
 Tired of standing at Your cross I'm ma jump up on it 
 Telling me shackles begone I'm singing freedom songs, come on

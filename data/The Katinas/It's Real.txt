Do you ever wonder what's reality? 
 Can you believe in something you can't see? 
 Is it just an emotional roller coaster fantasy? 
 I remember those were questions of my own 
 Till I made my heart his home (home) 
 Now I speak the truth of a miracle 
 I'v been saved by love that's tangible 
 (And I know that it's real) 
 Ain't no doubt about it 
 So real 
 I know I've gotta have it 
 The spirit lives in my soul 
 I want my life to show 
 (That it's real) 
 Ain't no doubt about it 
 So real 
 I can't live without it 
 It's in my heart 
 I want the world to know 
 (Know that it's real) 
 (So real) 
 Do you want it? 
 You can have it for yourself 
 Gotta believe 
 Trust him and you will achieve 
 Anything is possible 
 There is nothing you can't do 
 Once you open up your heart and let him in 
 He will never let you go 
 Oh no, no 
 He can turn your darkest night into a brighter day 
 And give you life 
 He's the only way 
 (Oh I know that he's real) 
 (I know that he's real) 
 It's real, it's real within my soul 
 So real I want the world to know 
 Not by my power or by might 
 But by my spirit says the lord 
 Every time I close my eyes I feel the spirit always near 
 If the lord is for me tell me who then shall I fear 
 (Who shall I fear) 
 (I know that it's real) 
 I know that it's real 
 (That it's real that it's real so real)

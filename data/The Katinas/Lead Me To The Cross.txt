Savior, I come quiet my soul 
 Remember, redemption's hill 
 Where Your blood was spilled 
 For my ransom 
 Everything I once held dear 
 I count it all as loss 
 Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees, Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself, I belong to You 
 Oh, lead me, lead me to the cross 
 You were as, I tempted and tried 
 Human, the word became flesh 
 Bore my sin in death 
 Now You're risen 
 Everything I once held dear 
 I count it all as loss 
 Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees, Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself, I belong to You 
 Oh, lead me 
 Lead me to Your heart, Your heart 
 Lead me to Your heart, Your heart 
 Everything I once held dear 
 I count it all as loss 
 Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees, Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself, I belong to You 
 Oh, lead me, lead me to 
 Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees, Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself, I belong to You 
 Oh, lead me, lead me 
 Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out 
 Bring me to my knees, Lord, I lay me down 
 Rid me of myself, I belong to You 
 So lead me, lead me to the cross

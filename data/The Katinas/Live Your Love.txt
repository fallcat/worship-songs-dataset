"I'm listening to a new song from heaven 
 I'm wide awake, yet dreaming of You 
 Though I'm not alone 
 I'm desperate without You 
 I see your mercy 
 Lord You are holy 
 I want to be more like You 
 Teach me to live Your love 
 Help me to give Your love 
 Show me Your way 
 Lord I'll obey 
 Your word and live Your love 
 I stand in awe, grateful remembrance 
 Press towards the goal 
 For the prize I must win 
 I've got my eyes focused upon You 
 Show me Your beauty 
 Cause Lord it's your goodness that makes me more like You 
 Holy wind, blow fresh 
 Your fire anew 
 Come breathe on my soul 
 Let my heart be for You 
 I've witnessed the light 
 And the power of Your might 
 Teach me to live Your love 
 Help me to give Your love 
 Show me Your way 
 Lord I'll obey 
 Your word and live Your love"

Mama, we were so sad when you left us 
 You know, things were so right, 
 And our future seemed bright 
 Then you were gone 
 Mama, you were gone 
 You were amazing, 
 You were so beautiful. 
 Tell me, why did it end this way? 
 But before you went on 
 With your last breath you said¡¦ 
 You said "We must go on 
 On till Jesus comes." 
 We'll see you again, 
 Yes we'll see you again, mom again (2x) 
 It's gonna be better. 
 We'll together. We'll be together. 
 Forever and ever when Jesus comes 
 In the place after 
 There is love and laughter 
 Forever and ever 
 When Jesus comes 
 When he comes (4x) 
 It's gonna be better 
 We'll be together 
 Forever and ever 
 When Jesus comes

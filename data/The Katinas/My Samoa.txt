On a small volcanic island 
 Population fifty plus thousand 
 One main road by the oceanside 
 Mountains so green 
 Under a big blue sky 
 Palm trees are swaying side to side 
 They're always waving 
 When I wake up in the morning 
 I can hear the mothers praying 
 Island people smiling 
 Where the son is always shining 
 Just imagine season never changes 
 And the love is always flowing 
 This is my Samoa 
 More beautiful than any 
 Place you've ever seen 
 Quite naturally it's so calm and serene 
 Faith in God is the Common ground 
 We're all family 
 Can you hear the sounds? 
 The ocean flows and seawinds blow 
 On the homestead of my soul 
 There's no place I'd rather be 
 Then the islands of my dreams 
 Island people calling 
 Where the son is always shining 
 Just imagine season never changes 
 And the love is always flowing 
 This is my Samoa 
 O ce e lalelei 
 It's yu that I adore 
 Ou te alola la te ce 
 I love you so much 
 Said I've finally realized 
 That it's almost paradise 
 Island people smiling 
 Where the son is always shining 
 Just imagine season never changes 
 And the love is always flowing 
 This is my Samoa 
 Island people smiling 
 Where the son is always shining 
 Just imagine season never changes 
 And the love is always flowing 
 This is my Samoa 
 This is where I come from 
 This is where I come from 
 This is where I come from 
 My Samoa ...

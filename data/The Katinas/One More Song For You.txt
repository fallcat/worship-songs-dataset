As long as there is time 
 The one breath left in me 
 There will always 
 Be one more song for You 
 As long as there is room for one more voice of praise 
 And a need for a word of love and truth 
 To help my brother through 
 There'll be one more song for You 
 You were there with Your songs of laughter 
 Words of hope for our fears 
 But what are songs when no one will sing them 
 What are words when no one hears 
 There were times when lying gave question 
 When I asked, no one knew 
 Then I found the answer's in You 
 So as long as there is time 
 And one breath left in me 
 There will always 
 Be one more song for You 
 And as long as there is room for one more voice of praise 
 And a need for a word of love and truth 
 To help my brother through 
 There'll be one more song for You 
 Love is in the air around me 
 Hope abounds everywhere 
 Living life in the arms of Jesus 
 Learning how to really care 
 Everyday is filled with purpose 
 All the old is made new 
 And I know, I owe it all to You 
 One more song for You 
 One more song for You 
 One more song for You 
 One more song for You 
 One more song for You 
 One more song for You 
 So as long as there is time 
 And one breath left in me 
 There will always 
 Be one more song for You 
 Oh, as long as there is room for one more voice of praise 
 And a need for a word of love and truth 
 To help my brother through 
 There'll be one more song for You 
 One more song for You 
 As long as there is time, one breath in me 
 As long as there is room, more voice of praise 
 As long as there is time, one breath in me 
 I'll sing one more song for You

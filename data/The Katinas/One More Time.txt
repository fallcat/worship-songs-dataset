One More Time 
 Lord, I saw your face last night 
 When I looked in the sky 
 You were smiling 
 You told me it would be okay 
 You would make a way 
 In my dark times 
 Every time I hear your voice 
 Every time I feel your touch 
 It makes me know that I can face tomorrow 
 One more time 
 When all my friends go away 
 I'll be glad to say 
 You're still near me 
 Even when the wind blows by 
 I feel warm inside 
 You're so lovely 
 I need you, don't leave me 
 Without you I can't survive 
 I know that I can face tomorrow 
 'Cause you will walk me through 
 My pain and sorrow 
 I know that I can face tomorrow 
 One more time 
 I can face tomorrow 
 You can face tomorrow 
 We can face tomorrow 
 One more time

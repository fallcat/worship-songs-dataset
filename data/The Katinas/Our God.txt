Water You turned into wine 
 Opened the eyes of the blind 
 There's no one like you 
 None like you 
 Into the darkness You shine 
 Out of the ashes we rise 
 There's No one like you 
 None like you 
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
 God You are higher than any other 
 Our God is Healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, Our God 
 Into the darkness you shining 
 Out of the ashes we Rise 
 No one like you 
 None like you 
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
 God You are higher than any other 
 Our God is Healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, Our God 
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger 
 God You are higher than any other 
 Our God is Healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, Our God 
 And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us 
 And if our God is with us, then what can stand against? 
 And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us

 Our God is Healer, awesome in power 
 Our God, Our God

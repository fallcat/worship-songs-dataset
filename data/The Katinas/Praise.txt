Whoo! 
 It sure is hot out here 
 Ya know? 
 I don't mind thought 
 Just glad to be free 
 Know what I'm saying, uh! 
 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance 
 I just wanna praise you 
 (What'cha wanna do?) 
 I just wanna praise you 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands 
 (Uh feel me?) 
 And I'm gonna praise you 
 (What'cha gon do?) 
 I'm gonna praise you 
 In the corners of mind 
 I just can't seem to find a reason to believe 
 That I can break free 
 Cause you see I have been down for so long 
 Feel like the hope is gone 
 But as I lift my hands, I understand 
 That I should praise you through my circumstance 
 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance 
 I just wanna praise you 
 I just wanna praise you 
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands 
 And I'm gonna praise you 
 I'm gonna praise you 
 Everything that could go wrong 
 All went wrong at one time 
 So much pressure fell on me 
 I thought I was gon lose my mind 
 But I know you wanna see 
 If I will hold on through these trials 
 But I need you to lift this load 
 'Cause I can't take it anymore 
 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance 
 I just wanna praise you 
 I just wanna praise you 
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands 
 And I'm gonna praise you 
 I'm gonna praise you 
 Been through the fire and the rain 
 Bound in every kind of way 
 But God has broken every chain 
 So let me go right now 
 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance 
 I just wanna praise you 
 I just wanna praise you 
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands 
 And I'm gonna praise you 
 I'm gonna praise you 
 Take them off 
 What'cha gonna do, yeah 
 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance 
 I just wanna praise you 
 I just wanna praise you 
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands 
 And I'm gonna praise you 
 I'm gonna praise you

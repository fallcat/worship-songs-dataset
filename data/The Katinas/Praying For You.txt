Seems like today is just like yesterday 
 You can't escape this pure insanity 
 Sweet memories, they fade away 
 The hurt inside just seems to multiply 
 Those tears you're crying won't last forever 
 Lean on my shoulder 
 Oh, it's not over 
 Tonight I'm prayin' for you 
 Down on my knees for you 
 Heaven can hear your name 
 Tonight, I'm prayin' 
 I'll keep on prayin' for you 
 She was young and innocent, full of aspirations 
 Till a choice she made went wrong, 
 Seemed to devastate and steal her song 
 Life lost its meaning 
 Voices are screaming 
 Will the chaos ever end 
 Can her soul recover once again 
 Go to chorus 
 I hope you find rest 
 Sleep till tomorrow 
 Lean on my shoulder 
 Oh, it's not over 
 Go to chorus 2 x 
 Oh-Whoa, yeah, yeah-oh 
 Hold on 
 Be strong 
 Hold on 
 (I'll keep on prayin' for you) 
 Hold on 
 Hold on 
 Be strong 
 Hold on

 Heaven can hear your name 
 Tonight I'm prayin'

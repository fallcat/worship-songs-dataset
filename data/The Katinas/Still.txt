Momma told me when I was a little boy 
 That heaven was waiting for me 
 If I'd open up my heart and welcome in the good Lord 
 Then I would have a friend 
 Forever even when she went to Jesus 
 And left me on the side 
 Time is going by 
 But I remember those words 
 And I'm still in love with You 
 Everything keeps changing 
 But I'm still in love with You 
 I'm in love with You Jesus. 
 I remember when she told me 
 Your Spirit will make my life complete 
 I didn't understand how then 
 But now it's making perfect sense 
 You'll be there for me even when I couldn't see 
 Throughout the hard times, the struggles and the pain 
 You mended my soul over again 
 And I'm still in love with You 
 Everything keeps changing 
 But I'm still in love with You 
 Forever I will thank You 
 So many times I stray so far from you Lord 
 But You've been faithful to me 
 Now we singin: 
 La la la la la la la 
 Each and every day 
 La la la la la la la 
 I'm in love with You in every way 
 La la la la la la la 
 You know when I don't have the words to say 
 Now I'm still in love with You

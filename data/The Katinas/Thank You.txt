Just a little while longer I wanna pray 
 Can't get You off my mind so I came to say 
 Thank You Lord just for loving me 
 Many times as I do forget 
 Every need that You have met 
 Oh thank You Lord, I know You're showing me 
 You are there when I am down and out 
 You're holding me, Your love is so amazing 
 Oh it changed me 
 Here I am with all I am 
 Raise my hands to worship You 
 I wanna say thank you, oh thank you 
 For everything, for who You are 
 You cover me, You touch my heart 
 I wanna say thank you 
 I could have died in my sin but You saved me 
 Didn't have any hope at all 
 You gave me peace divine, strength to carry on 
 I should have been the one to pay 
 But instead You took my place amazing grace 
 It's more than just a song 
 Even though I don't deserve Your love for me 
 You look beyond my fault and You showed mercy 
 Here I am with all I am 
 Raise my hands to worship You 
 I wanna say thank you, oh thank you 
 For everything, for who You are 
 You cover me, You touch my heart 
 I wanna say thank you 
 I wanna say thank you for the sun 
 I wanna say thank you for the rain 
 Everything You do is beautiful 
 I'm so grateful for Your love

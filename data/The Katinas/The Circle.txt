Sing me a song of love and joy 
 Peace and happiness 
 Try to be strong enough to stand 
 This world's test 
 It won't take long and in return 
 I'll do my best to see 
 That it gets spread all around 
 I've been searching high, looking low 
 Been wondering 
 What would be the better road 
 Should I have to hoe 
 And every now 
 And then when I'm feeling free 
 It occurs to me 
 Ain't this why we all came to be 
 Spread love round 
 With this message we could 
 Rain joy down and the world would see 
 How to spread love round, round, and round 
 Sing thee now this song 
 And let it tell your story 
 Sing now this song 
 And let it set you, should free 
 Let love be your lyric 
 And peace be your melody 
 This is why we all came to be 
 Come and go with me 
 Will the circle be unbroken 
 By and by lord 
 There's a better home yet awaiting 
 In the sky

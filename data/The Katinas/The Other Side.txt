I'll miss you 
 (Till then I'm gonna miss y-ou) 
 O-oh 
 There's never been a day 
 When your memory's, not on my 
 M-ind 
 Especially when I, I see your picture 
 Sometimes I cr-y 
 You are the water 
 That cleanses my s-oul 
 And you are the beauty 
 That makes me, wh-ole 
 I'll see you 
 On the other side 
 Somed-ay 
 (I really just can't imagine) 
 I really just can't imagine 
 Any other w-ay 
 Wait for me 
 'Cause I'll see you again 
 In t-ime 
 I know I'll see the day 
 When I can hold you 
 On the other s-ide 
 Oh my my my 
 I'm gonna h-old you 
 I look above the clouds 
 And I wonder, what you're doin' 
 Th-ere 
 Th-ere 
 When I close my eyes 
 I can feel you everywh-ere 
 Oh yes I can 
 I remember you laughing 
 O-oh 
 It feels so w-arm 
 Each day that is passing 
 I'm closer, to h-ome 
 Oh, I can hardly wait 
 There's no crying 
 (On the other s-ide) 
 We'll be smiling, y-eah 
 (On the other s-ide) 
 We'll be, together again 
 And I'm living for, (living for that 
 D-ay) 
 Oh no 
 (Wait for me) 
 I'm gonna see 
 ('Cause I'll see you again) 
 I'll see you, I'll see you again 
 In t-ime 
 'Cause I know I'll see the day 
 When I can hold you 
 I'm looking forward the day 
 When I can touch you once more 
 (I'm livin' for the day) 
 (I'll be with y-ou) 
 I'll be with y-ou 
 (On the other s-ide) 
 O-h, you and me 
 In etenit-y 
 Oh oh 
 Said I'll keep pressin' on 
 'Cause you see 
 One of these mornings it won't be long 
 I'll be goin' to the other side 
 Mmm, hey, oh yes I will 
 (One of these mornings it won't be long) 
 (I'll be goin' to the other side) 
 Y-eah 
 One of these mornings it won't be long 
 I'll be goin' to the other side 
 (One of these mornings it won't be long) 
 (I'll be goin' to the other side) 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah hey 
 (I miss you miss you miss y-ou)

 Yeah just keep carryin' on 
 (Till then I'm gonna miss y-ou)

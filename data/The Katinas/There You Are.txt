In the gentle wind 
 That blows through the trees 
 Oh 
 In the house of love 
 Where I fall on my knees 
 Fall on my knees 
 You make Your presence known 
 When I'm all al-one 
 Or on a crowded street 
 In every, stranger I meet 
 There You are when I need You 
 In the darkness still I see You 
 (Still I see You) 
 (Time after time) 
 When my spirit is sailing 
 And the world just keeps breaking my heart 
 Th-ere, You are 
 O-oh, o-oh o-oh 
 Whoo 
 If I start to smile 
 You must be on my mind 
 When my heart goes wild 
 (I know) 
 I know who I'll find 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 If I'm standing t-all, whoo 
 Even if I start, to f-all 
 I know, that You stay close to m-e 
 'Cause it's Your love I n-eed 
 In the best and worst 
 In the good and b-ad times 
 You are there 
 (You are th-ere) 
 I don't need to search 
 I can f-eel, Y-ou, everywhere 
 Y-eah, y-eah 
 O-oh, o-oh o-oh 
 Whoo 
 O-oh, o-oh o-oh 
 Ooh yeah 
 If I'm st-anding t-all 
 Hey 
 Even if I start, to f-all 
 You said You said you'd stay close to me 
 When it's love (when it's love) 
 When it's love that I feel 
 On a mountain high 
 Even in a valley low 
 Whoo 
 Th-ere, You are 
 Y-ou are my Shepherd 
 Even in my darkest h-our 
 Th-ere, You are 
 There, You are 
 There, You are 
 I say there, You are 
 There You are 
 Th-ere, You are 
 There You are there You are 
 There You are there You are 
 There You are there You are 
 Th-ere, You are 
 O-oh

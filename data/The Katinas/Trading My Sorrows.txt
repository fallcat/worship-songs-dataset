I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 And I'm trading my sickness 
 I'm trading my pain 
 I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 We say Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Well I'm pressed but not crushed, persecuted not abandoned 
 Struck down but not destroyed 
 I'm blessed beyond the curse for His promise will endure 
 And His joy's gonna be my strength 
 Though the sorrow may last for the night 
 His joy comes in the morning 
 Well I'm trading my sorrows 
 I'm trading my shame 
 I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord, yeah 
 I'm trading my sickness 
 I'm trading my pain 
 I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen 
 Well I'm pressed but not crushed, persecuted not abandoned 
 Struck down but not destroyed 
 I'm blessed beyond the curse for His promise will endure 
 And His joy's gonna be my strength 
 Though the sorrow may last for the night 
 His joy comes in the morning 
 I'm trading my sorrows 
 Oh, I'm trading my shame 
 I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 Well I'm trading my sickness 
 I'm trading for all of my pain 
 I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord 
 Everybody help me sing 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord Amen 
 Oh I say Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord 
 Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord Amen

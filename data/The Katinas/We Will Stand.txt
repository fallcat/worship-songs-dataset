Sometimes it's hard for me to understand 
 Why we pull away from each other so easily, 
 Even though we're all walking the same road 
 Yet we build dividing walls between 
 Our brothers and ourselves. 
 But I, I don't care what label you may wear 
 If you believe in Jesus you belong with me. 
 The bond we share is all I care to see 
 And we'll change the world forever 
 If you will join with me, 
 Join and sing, sing, 
 You're my brother, you're my sister, 
 So take me by the hand 
 Together we will work until He comes. 
 There's no foe that can defeat us 
 When we're walking side by side. 
 So long as there is love, 
 We will stand. 
 The day will come when we will be as one, 
 And with a mighty voice together 
 We will proclaim that Jesus 
 Jesus is King. 
 It will echo through the earth; 
 It will shake the nations, 
 And the world will see, 
 See that you're my brother, you're my sister 
 So take me by the hand 
 Together we will work until He comes. 
 There's no foe that can defeat us 
 When we're walking side by side. 
 So long as there is love, 
 We will stand. 
 Take me by the hand, 
 Join with me. 
 Join and see - yeah. 
 You're my brother, you're my sister, 
 So take me by the hand. 
 Together we will work until He comes. 
 There's no foe that can defeat us 
 When we're walking side by side. 
 As long as there is love, 
 We will stand

If the only way I know I won't forget 
 Everything I need to way about the times that I regret 
 When I didn't hold you because there was 
 So much I couldn't let go of 
 I was so afraid - but before it's too late 
 I'm writing this letter to tell you the 
 Gonna lay it all down - pour it out 
 And pray that it reaches you 
 I'm saying I'm sorry. 
 I'm begging with all my heart. 
 Never told you enough that you are my love 
 I sent it with a kiss across the miles 
 Raised the letter to my lips and hope 
 That maybe someday I will 
 Look to the sky above and see 
 Somehow you've forgiven me 
 I pray that I'll get through 
 I'll spend forever missing you 
 These words they flow so easily 
 Just fall upon the page 
 If only you were next to me 
 I'd say it to your face - so

Creator of all things 
 Healer of my being 
 Through your righteousness 
 I've been redeemed 
 Forgiven by your grace 
 Your joy is my strength 
 When everything has changed 
 You stay the same 
 You are God 
 Bright and Morning Star 
 When I'm down you lift me up 
 You're the Lover of my heart 
 You are God 
 Mender of my soul 
 You're the rain that makes my whole 
 You are God 
 Ever-present help 
 Savior of my life 
 Everything I have belongs to you 
 My time is in your hands 
 My purpose is your will 
 I know that you'll provide 
 So I'II be still 
 You are the One 
 That delivers me 
 It's not because of what I am 
 But who You are 
 You are God 
 You're my provider 
 When I'm down 
 You lift me higher 
 When I'm weak 
 You are the fire 
 That turns me into gold 
 You are God 
 Alpha, Omega 
 Take my life 
 Lord I surrender 
 You're the rain that makes me whole 
 You are God

I'm trying Lord 
 I'm crying out to You 
 Hear me when I say 
 I really need You today 
 I'm weary Lord 
 Trying to do my best 
 But I fall so many times 
 Have mercy on those 
 Who hope to fly 
 You promise rest 
 When we lay our burden down 
 So I'm throwing all my troubles 
 And my worries to the ground 
 You are the Lord of my life 
 You are my strength at all times 
 There is nothing I will fear 
 'Cause you are here 
 You are my refuge and hope 
 Quench my thirsty soul 
 Be alive in my heart 
 Father I'm praying You are 
 I'm hurting Lord 
 This world can hit me so hard 
 Heal me with Your grace 
 I don't deserve Your grace 
 I'm sorry Lord 
 Forgive me when I'm losing sight 
 I get in my way 
 I really need You today 
 You promise life, life eternally 
 So I beg Your living water come 
 And rain deserve Your grace 
 I'm sorry Lord 
 Forgive me when I'm losing sight 
 I get in my way 
 I really need You today 
 You promise life, life eternally 
 So I beg Your living water 
 Come and rain down on me 
 You are my hope 
 You are my rest 
 You are my fortress 
 When I'm not strong enough 
 You pick me up when I'm down 
 Placed my feet on solid ground 
 Lord I love You 
 Everything I'll ever need 
 You are

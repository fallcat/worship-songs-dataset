There's a place where everyone can be happy, 
 It's the most beautiful place in the whole fucking world, 
 It's made of candy canes and planes, 
 Red choo-choo trains and the meanest little boys, 
 And the most innocent little girls, 
 And you know, 
 I wish that I could go there, 
 It's a road that I have not found, 
 And I wish you the best of luck dear, 
 Drop a card or letter to my side of town, 
 Cause there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend, 
 But baby I'm amazed by the hate that you, can send and you, 
 Painted my entire world but I, 
 Don't have the turpentine to clean 
 What you have soiled 
 And I won't forget it 
 There's a place where everyone can be right, 
 Even though you remain determined to be opposed, 
 Admittance requires no qualifications, 
 It's where everyone has been and where everybody goes, 
 So please try not to be impatient, 
 For we all hate standing in line, 
 And when the farm is good and bought, 
 You'll be there without a thought, 
 And eternity my friend, is a long fucking time.

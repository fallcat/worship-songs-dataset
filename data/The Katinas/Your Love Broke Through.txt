Like a foolish dreamer, 
 Trying to build a highway to the sky 
 All my hopes 
 Would come tumbling down, 
 And I never knew just why 
 Until today, 
 When you pulled away the clouds 
 That hung like curtains on my eyes 
 Well I've been blind all these wasted years 
 And I though I was so wise 
 But then you took me by surprise 
 Like waking up from the longest dream, 
 How real it seemed 
 Until your love broke through 
 I've been lost in a fantasy, 
 That blinded me 
 Until your love broke through 
 All my life I've been searching 
 For that crazy missing part 
 And with one touch, 
 You just rolled away 
 The stone that held my heart 
 And now I see that the answer was as easy, 
 As just asking you in 
 And I am so sure 
 I could never doubt your gentle touch again 
 It's like the power of the wind 
 Like waking up from the longest dream, 
 How real it seemed 
 Until your love broke through 
 I've been lost in a fantasy, 
 That blinded me 
 Until your love, 
 Until your love, broke through

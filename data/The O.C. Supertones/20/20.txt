I felt so introspective tonight 
 Thinkin' ahead about my final hindsight 
 Did I make every moment count 
 How much did I sit about 
 Doin' not the good I know to do 
 What will I say when I'm faced with His glory 
 The saints and the angels as I tell my story 
 Will the works I've accomplished be worthy of Heaven 
 What will I think lookin' back 
 What was gold what was dross 
 What was gain and what was loss 
 What will stand and what was fleeting 
 And what will I change while my hearts still beating 
 20/20 (x3) 
 So many thoughts fill up my mind 
 Look inside the word and I can't find 
 The promise of another day 
 Or how much longer I will stay 
 No one really knows how long they have 
 20/20 (x3) 
 (Instrumental bridge)

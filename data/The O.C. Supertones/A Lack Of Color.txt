And when I see you 
 I really see you upside down 
 But my brain knows better 
 It picks you up and turns you 'round 
 Turns you 'round, turns you 'round 
 If you feel discouraged 
 When there's a lack of color here 
 Please don't worry lover 
 It's really bursting at the seams 
 Absorbing everything, the spectrum's A to Z 
 This is facts not fiction 
 For the first time in years 
 All the girls in every girlie magazine 
 Can't make me feel any less alone 
 I'm reaching for the phone to call at 7:03 
 And on your machine I slur a plea 
 For you to come home 
 But I know it's too late 
 And I should have given you a reason to stay 
 Given you a reason to stay 
 Given you a reason to stay 
 Given you a reason to stay 
 This is facts not fiction 
 For the first time in years

Well I'm as ugly as sin, that is to say I'm not good lookin' 
 But I can bust some ska, in fact the rhythm rhyme is cookin' 
 Brighten up your soul and loosen up your brain 
 Make my heartbeat all fast like the girl from plain Jane 
 Now please allow me to proceed and bust my rude boy flow 
 On the underground scene at the underground show 
 Grownups, kids and inbetweens I guess it takes all kinds 
 'Cause I guess we got true love, my blood, my blood true love is blind 
 One purpose is to worship and to make the body strong 
 I don't care about your haircut, can't we all just get along? 
 Not just get along, but to really love and care 
 If your eyes are on the Lord you can't see nobody's hair 
 Adonai Adonai! 
 Well I don't claim to be a rhymin' apparatus 
 I don't want to be a gangster, I don't want to be the baddest 
 I ain't no Al Pacino and I ain't no Al Capone 
 I'm just a rude boy with a new toy 
 Add two speakers and a microphone 
 So listen up, listen up and make sure that you can hear me 
 I'm your brother and I'm your friend so come on and get near me 
 I'm a sinner just like all of you don't make me into an idol 
 I'm a preacher, I'm a saint and sinner, guess I fit the titles 
 Gotta keep a humble heart, because my good is not enough 
 Jehova Jireh gotta give the glory up up up 
 To Y'shua me salvitore 
 Gotta give you all the glory God, I give you all my fears 
 God I give you all my years 
 You're my God and I will bow, I'll show all the proud people how 
 You're my God and I will bow, in fact I think I'll bow right now 
 Adonai Adonai!

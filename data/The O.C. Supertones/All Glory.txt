All around the world every time its told 
 The story always sounds like this 
 The powerful will use that power to kill 
 The poor are used up by the rich 
 The righteous in chains and the innocent slain 
 All for the wicked man's gain 
 And the fool believes that God cannot see 
 He has no fear of His name 
 All the world will lift its eyes 
 The time will come, our God will rise! 
 All glory, all power, hallelujah 
 A day will come and God will fight 
 And all the wrongs will be made right! 
 All glory all power hallelujah 
 The rebel's gun and the tyrant's tank 
 Are gonna be fuel for the flame 
 And sweet relief for those who grieve 
 When the day of the Lord is proclaimed 
 And without a shot shot, or a single bomb dropped 
 The killing machine will forever stop 
 There'll be no more war when the Prince of Peace 
 Tells all of the world His name 
 Unto our God, we lay it down 
 Before the thrown, before the crown 
 To you oh God, we give ourselves 
 Be lifted high, above all else

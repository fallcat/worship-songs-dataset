Well I'm so old school that I'm fresh again 
 Come check my stats I'm a rude boy veteran 
 The time has come to release some adrenaline 
 A Supertone in every bone of my skeleton 
 A young gentleman from the tribe of Benjamin 
 Here to enhance your spiritual regimen 
 I want to get you reconnected with the genuine 
 Specimen come and take the soul medicine 
 We do it for the love we do it for the Lord 
 We do it for the people 'cause they want some more 
 We do it for the fame, of the Most High 
 So come on inside and get all the way alive! 
 A 180 beats is where I do my poetry 
 Guerrilla radio we high jacked the frequency 
 Escape from hell like Dante Allghieri 
 And reach paradise in this divine comedy 
 God's people gotta raise their hands in victory 
 Because the Most High's hand moves history 
 And one day He's gonna erase the boundary 
 Between the earth and the realm of the heavenly 
 This beat is rude you should ask for an apology 
 So underground it's like studying geology 
 I grip the mic while I'm teaching you theology 
 I'm gonna speak it till you the sing the doxology 
 Now stop a minute people pay attention to your pastor 
 Ladies and gentlemen now kindly stop your jibber jabber 
 It's not the end it's just the finish of another chapter 
 And when it's over we'll be living happily ever after

I love the way this feels 
 To tell the truth real 
 The music hits your head and chest 
 And now you know the deal 
 Given the dream when I turned nineteen 
 And the last four years we've been playing to whoever 
 The six of us together headed out to wherever 
 Four years older, twenty three wiser 
 Still not tired of going off like geyser 
 We ain't everything that we're cracked up to be 
 Down with the king like jay and run dmc 
 Step on the stage, move the groove steadily 
 Keep our heads on and splurge the word readily 
 Another night, another show 
 My whole soul's fired up and ready to go 
 (Repeat) 
 No wait, don't turn away 
 There's something I must say 
 If god's not glorified 
 We shouldn't be here today 
 'Cause if we ain't speaking Christ 
 We ain't speaking nothing 
 Look into my eyes and 
 You tell me if I'm bluffing 
 From here on out we're going all out light it up with no doubt 
 Evangelize and edify that's what we're all about 
 Don't know what God has in store 
 But that's the way we're headed 
 With the pedal to the floor

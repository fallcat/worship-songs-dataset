Say, you got a minute friend? 
 Because I'd like to tell you something. 
 You may think nothing of it, but wait...you're gonna love it. 
 What if I told you I held the one true philosophy? 
 Would you hear me out or just turn your back and laugh at me? 
 Lord, I just don't understand this strange creature you call man. 
 Who thinks he lives by his own hand, but I know. 
 I know 
 I know 
 I know 
 I know 
 There's no life away from you. 
 There's no life away from you. 
 There's no life away from you. 
 There's no life away from you. 
 So I will remain still and silent, for fear of the words I may say. 
 And am I still in my defiance, when I'm trying so hard to obey?  Yeah, yeah 
 Lord I've gotten away from you

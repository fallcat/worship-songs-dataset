I don't understand 
 It's so in to be unaffected 
 They only like the cynical bands 
 The bubble gum and the disconnected 
 They point and laugh 
 At everybody who believes in something 
 Let them laugh 
 I'd rather be alive so we'll be 
 Singin' and smilin' and dancin' 
 And cryin' and pourin' out our hearts to Jesus 
 Jokin' and lovin' and carin' and 
 Wearin' my heart up on my sleeve 
 If it's hip to be dead inside 
 I'd rather be a fool 
 'Cause life is way too precious 
 To spend it bein' cool 
 Just act like you don't care 
 That's the way to be a cool kid 
 A bored 
 Blase empty stare 
 Is all you need to be a cool kid 
 I don't understand 
 It's so in to be unaffected 
 They only like the cynical bands 
 The bubble gum and the disconnected 
 They point and laugh 
 At everybody who believes in something 
 Let them laugh 
 I'd rather be alive so we'll be 
 Singin' and smilin' and dancin' 
 And cryin' and pourin' out our hearts to Jesus 
 Jokin' and lovin' and carin' and 
 Wearin' my heart up on my sleeve 
 If it's hip to be dead inside 
 I'd rather be a fool 
 'Cause life is way too precious 
 To spend it bein' cool 
 Singin' and smilin' and dancin' 
 And cryin' and pourin' out our hearts to Jesus 
 Jokin' and lovin' and carin' and 
 Wearin' my heart up on my sleeve 
 If it's hip to be dead inside 
 I'd rather be a fool 
 'Cause life is way too precious 
 To spend it bein' cool 
 They never fail 
 'Cause they don't attempt to do anything but ridicule 
 Be cynical 
 I'd rather be uncool

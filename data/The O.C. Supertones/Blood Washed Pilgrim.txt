I saw a blood washed pilgrim, a sinner saved by grace 
 Up on the King's great highway, with peaceful shining face 
 Temptations sore beset him, but nothing could a fright 
 He said the yoke is easy, the burden it is light 
 Palms of victory, crowns of glory 
 Palms of victory I shall wear 
 I saw him in the furnace, he neither doubted nor feared 
 And in the flames beside him the Son of God appeared 
 Though seven times 'twas heated, with all the tempters might 
 He said the yoke is easy, the burden it is light 
 I saw him overcoming, through all the swelling strife 
 I saw him cross the threshold of God's eternal life 
 The crown, the throne the scepter, the name 
 The stone so white for those who are found in Jesus 
 The burden it is light

Oh, I know there'd be trouble, 
 It's what happens when you live, 
 But hope is like a flame that never dies, 
 Hard's the road that I have taken, 
 But I walk it unforsaken. 
 I know this trial is not in vain because, 
 I feel my heart begin to change. 
 I am a brand new thing, 
 Love came walkin' in. 
 Oh, God make me stronger so I can wear the cross, 
 I'm weak. 
 I've fallen down so many times, 
 I will bear the weight of sorrow and it won't seem so great tomorrow, 
 Death to lose and life to gain. 
 Now I feel my heart begin to change, 
 Oh, Lord I want to know you, 
 I don't care for nothin' else, 
 'Cause nothin' and no one else can satisfy. 
 Here's my heart, oh please just take it, 
 I'm afraid, 
 But please just break it, 
 I know this trial is not in vain because I feel my heart begin to change...

We've been on the run 
 Driving in the sun 
 Looking out for number 1 
 California, here we come 
 Right back where we started from 
 Hustlers grab your guns 
 Your shadow weighs a ton 
 Driving down the 101 
 California, here we come 
 Right back where we started from 
 California 
 (California) 
 Here we come 
 On the stereo 
 Listen as we go 
 Nothing's gonna stop me now 
 California, here we come 
 Right back where we started from 
 A pedal to the floor 
 Thinkin' of the roar 
 Gotta get us to the show 
 California, here we come 
 Right back where we started from 
 California 
 (California) 
 Here we come 
 California, California, here we come, oh, oh 
 California, California, here we come 
 California, California, here we come 
 California, California, here we come 
 California, California, here we come

Son, what have you done? 
 You're caught by the river 
 You're coming undone 
 Life, you know it can't be so easy 
 But you can't just leave it 
 'Cause you're not in control no more 
 And you give it all away 
 Would you give it all away now? 
 Don't let it come apart 
 Don't want to see you come apart 
 Son, what are you doing? 
 You learned a hard lesson 
 When you stood by the water 
 You and I were so full of love and hope 
 Would you give it all up now? 
 Would you give in just to spite them all? 
 And you give it all away 
 And would you give it all away now? 
 Don't let it come apart 
 Don't want to see you come apart 
 'Cause you give it all away 
 And you give it all away now 
 Don't let it come apart 
 Don't want to see you come apart 
 Lay, I lay in the long grass 
 So many people 
 So many people pass 
 Stay, stay here and lie on back 
 Get down in the cornfields 
 Stay till we're caught at last 
 Give it all away 
 Give it all away now 
 Don't let it come apart 
 Don't want to see you come apart 
 And you give it all away 
 Would you give it all away now? 
 Don't let it come apart 
 Don't want to see you come apart 
 If you give it all away 
 If you give it all away 
 Would you give it all away? 
 And you give it all away 
 And you give it all away 
 Would you give it all away? 
 Give it all away 
 Give it all away

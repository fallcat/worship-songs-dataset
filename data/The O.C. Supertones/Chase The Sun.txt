Welcome to the epicenter, 
 Where we got spring and summer, 
 But we skip the winter. 
 Feel free to enter 
 The zone of the Supertones, 
 Where late into the night we just 
 Rock the microphone. 
 We lived inside the fault lines 
 Beneath the earth's surface. 
 Spendin' all over time 
 Readin' books and writin verses. 
 The earth started shakin' 
 From the noise we were makin' 
 We emerged from the rubble, 
 OC was taken. 
 With the music came the message, 
 So we rock the verbs. 
 Still neutral as a nazi 
 So forget what you heard. 
 We never leave the cross behind 
 We use it as our banner, 
 Scripture the vernacular, 
 Jesus is the grammar 
 Throw your hands up, 
 Throw your hands up high! 
 Tear the roof off and pull down the sky! 
 Chase the sun back to California, 
 Tears in my eyes. 
 Tell me where you're from, 
 The mighty west side! 
 Let me continue 
 To lighten up the mood a littles 
 Never number one, 
 But never playin' second fiddle. 
 My thoughts are like a circle, 
 With Jesus in the model 
 Rhyme of a reason, 
 I don't rhyme to riddle. 
 High emotions like I'm yellin' 
 No need to be alarmed. 
 Supertones is what your smelin' 
 If lovin' you's a crime, 
 Then baby I'm a felon. 
 Where we go from here, 
 My people, there's no tellin'... 
 Are you ready to go 
 When it's time to get 
 Back on the road just to see you? 
 On this narrow path 
 We got no time to dally. 
 Follow my lead 
 And chase the sun back to Cali. 
 Throw your hands up, 
 Throw your hands up high! 
 Tear the roof off and pull down the sky! 
 Chase the sun back to California, 
 Tears in my eyes. 
 Tell me where you're from, 
 The mighty west side! 
 Throw your hands up, 
 Throw your hands up high! 
 Tear the roof off and pull down the sky! 
 Chase the sun back to California, 
 Tears in my eyes. 
 Tell me where you're from, 
 The mighty west side! 
 Throw your hands up, 
 Throw your hands up high! 
 Tear the roof off and pull down the sky! 
 Chase the sun back to California, 
 Tears in my eyes. 
 Tell me where you're from, 
 The mighty west side! 
 Throw your hands up, 
 Throw your hands up high! 
 Tear the roof off and pull down the sky! 
 Chase the sun back to California, 
 Tears in my eyes. 
 Tell me where you're from, 
 The mighty west side! 
 Throw your hands up, 
 Throw your hands up high! 
 Tear the roof off and pull down the sky! 
 Chase the sun back to California, 
 Tears in my eyes. 
 Tell me where you're from, 
 The mighty west side! 
 Throw your hands up, 
 Throw your hands up high! 
 Tear the roof off and pull down the sky! 
 Chase the sun back to California, 
 Tears in my eyes. 
 Tell me where you're from, 
 The mighty west side!

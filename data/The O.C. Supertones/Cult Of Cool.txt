It's just another lie to sell to me 
 But I'm not buying 
 To live the way they do on MTV 
 Yeah you're trying 
 Just a little too hard and we can see through 
 There's a guy in a suit and he's trying to tell you 
 What you should like and what you should do 
 Will you fall in with the world or will you say 
 We won't pay for a lie! 
 Get away right away! 
 I want Christ, Christ alone! 
 Christ to call me His own! 
 We won't play by your rules! 
 Here is one you won't fool! 
 I think it's dumb 
 I won't succumb to the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool. 
 To them you're just a number on a page 
 A target market 
 Try it out on someone your age 
 And hope you buy it 
 You're trying too hard and we can see through 
 There's a guy in a suit and he's trying to tell you 
 What you should like and what you should do 
 Will you fall in with the world or will you say 
 We won't pay for a lie! 
 Get away right away! 
 I want Christ, Christ alone! 
 Christ to call me His own! 
 We won't play by your rules! 
 Here is one you won't fool! 
 I think it's dumb 
 I won't succumb to the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool. 
 There is a decision to be made 
 Will you conform? 
 That is how the companies get paid 
 Or are you transformed? 
 You pay somebody to poison your mind 
 Will you be a target marker or will you be a gold mine? 
 There's a brainwash store and they're waiting in line 
 Will you fall in with the world or will you say 
 We won't pay for a lie 
 Get away right away! 
 I want Christ, Christ alone! 
 Christ to call me His own! 
 We won't play by your rules! 
 Here is one you won't fool! 
 I think it's dumb 
 I won't succumb to the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool. 
 To the cult of cool.

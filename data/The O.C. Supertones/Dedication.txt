Side by side, driving the same highway. 
 Leaving behind everything and everyone you love. 
 The cost to pay, to tell the world of Jesus. 
 Hoping that these bridges burned will not be just in vain. 
 It helps to think that somewhere you're feeling just the same. 
 And don't take even a moment for granted. 
 Don't lose heart when the world crashes down. 
 How many miles ahead? 
 I can't count the ones behind. 
 To all the friends that we've collected, all the people we respect. 
 For the hope and joy that comes with you. 
 We made this up and wrote it down and dedicated this song to you 
 No turning back and can't say that I regret it 
 When every day 
 God promises testify themselves 
 Sometimes it's hard, and the road keeps stretching longer. 
 Tonight my wife's longing voice on a Holiday Inn phone. 
 It helps to think that somewhere you're feeling just the same. 
 And don't take even a moment for granted. 
 Don't lose heart when the world crashes down. 
 How many miles ahead? 
 I can't count the ones behind. 
 To all the friends that we've collected, all the people we respect. 
 For the hope and joy the love 
 The inspiration for you now 
 We made this up and wrote it down and dedicated this song to you 
 How many miles ahead? 
 I can't count the ones behind, 
 I wish you god's speed, friend. 
 You're always on my mind. 
 Will you remember me, say, seven years from now? 
 And where will we be then? 
 Well, I'm here for you now. 
 For you 
 For you 
 This song for you

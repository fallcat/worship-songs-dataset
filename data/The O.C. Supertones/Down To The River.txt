Come down to the river 
 Walk down to the shore 
 Living water to quench 
 Your thirsty soul 
 Come drink from the water 
 Thirst no more 
 Jesus said lay your burden down 
 If you're tired of carrying it around 
 Sing a new song your back unbowed 
 Sing a new song sing it out loud 
 Come on and hear God's people sing redemption songs 
 And lift your voice and sing along 
 Sing a new song stand up proud 
 Sing a new song sing it out loud 
 For the weighed down struggling and burdened 
 The tired out and hurting it's time to put it down 
 When life feels like it's getting too tough 
 Like you carry too much come drop it on the sacred ground 
 Jesus says that his burden's light 
 And He's gonna make everything all right, 
 Sing a new song your back unbowed 
 Sing a new song sing it out loud 
 Come on and hear God's people sing a song of praise 
 Come sit at His feet and learn his ways 
 Sing a new song stand up proud 
 Sing a new song sing it out loud 
 For the empty withered up and hollow 
 To the outcast He calls you to follow 
 To the lost and confused, the user and the used 
 The rejects and the losers God is calling out to you

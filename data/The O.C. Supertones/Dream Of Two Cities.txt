I had a dream last night 
 I was a bird in flight 
 A burning city on my left 
 And a golden one on my right 
 There was a woman there 
 Tearing out her hair 
 In dust and ash she laid 
 The sins have been repaid 
 Oh Babylon, the whole earth has drank the madness in your wine 
 Oh Babylon, but the day has come when you will pay for every crime 
 And now it's time to take the wall! 
 'Cause Babylon must fall! 
 And raze it to the ground! 
 'Cause Judgement has come down! 
 But Jerusalem will stand, 
 A flood of justice flows across the land 
 And the earth take up the song 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Then in the golden town 
 I saw a throne and crown 
 To it word gathered 'round 
 The righteous bowing down 
 And the streets, they rang 
 With the song they sang 
 Bring forth the Lamb who died 
 And now bring forth His bride 
 Oh Jerusalem, your towers rising high in victory 
 Oh Jerusalem, from your gates, let peace and justice flow like rivers to the sea 
 But now it's time to take the wall! 
 'Cause Babylon must fall! 
 And raze it to the ground! 
 'Cause Judgement has come down! 
 But Jerusalem will stand, 
 A flood of justice flows across the land 
 And the earth take up the song 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 And now it's time to take the wall! 
 'Cause Babylon must fall! 
 And raze it to the ground! 
 'Cause Judgement has come down! 
 But Jerusalem will stand, 
 A flood of justice flows across the land 
 And the earth take up the song 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon! 
 Whoa... 
 When we bring down Babylon!

Down down down 
 That's the way we're traveling 
 Our social fabric unravels 
 But who pulled the string 
 Philosophers politicians or the school teachers 
 Game of life and death and we're sitting on the bleachers 
 What happened to our voice 
 What happened to our influence 
 Tell me who will listen to uneducated congregants 
 And why should they when all we have to say is 
 Bumper sticker doctrine and cute catch phrases 
 Does this amaze us that no one will take us seriously 
 We talk big but then we sit in atrophy 
 Apathy they make comedy of our hypocrisy 
 Unaware of true biblical philosophy 
 So we gotta watch what we do and what they see 
 'Cause we represent Christ plus Christianity 
 The underground sound here to take your mind higher 
 I pound the ground burn it down like fire 
 We walk the long path, still on the first half 
 You escape reason, we escape wrath. 
 God is not concerned with Gallup Poll opinion 
 Or if the whole human race were to disagree with him 
 Truth is what I spit 
 But you ain't hearing it 
 Or you ain't having it 
 But it don't matter which 
 'Cause God is still himself 
 And he could still strike us dead 
 Even in the pink of health 
 You don't think I should say that 
 You say you don't believe that 
 Our opinion counts for zero 
 And that is simply that 
 Like I'm Mojo that's how it goes 
 That's just the way of things 
 God is not impressed, disagreeing won't change anything 
 We all must beg for mercy and surely God'll show it 
 There's a reason for our hope you ask me how I know it 
 God said it and that without a doubt 
 "He who comes to me I will in no way cast out." 
 A city under siege who will you believe 
 Champions of truth or of apostasy 
 You wanna take on me 
 You take on Elohim 
 He controls all that was is and what will be

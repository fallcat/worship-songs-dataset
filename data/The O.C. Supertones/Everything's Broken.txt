When my heart is aching 
 It's the right time it's the right time 
 And my soul is reaching 
 It's the right it's the right 
 Time to dive deep to understand 
 There is an Adam in every man 
 This was my garden and I made it die 
 It's asking me why 
 But I see tears in all things, everything is broken 
 I hear them crying, everything is broken 
 There was a time when the truth didn't have to be spoken 
 But now everything's broken 
 This is my confession 
 It's about time it's about time 
 Of the world's condition 
 It's about time, it's about 
 Time that you see my glory and shame 
 This world fell through me 
 But out of flames will rise a new earth 
 From death will come birth 
 A cure to the curse 
 I live in frustration 
 And it is mine and it is mine 
 Watch my garden dying 
 And it is mine and it is 
 I gave it death and I brought it hell 
 And there grew a cross to mark where I fell 
 A day will come when Adam again will pay for my sins

When I hate me and when they hate me, 
 He has loved me, He'll always love me 
 He'll let me exalt Him, let me exalt Him 
 Let me exalt Him, oh Lord 
 It doesn't mean I won't be scared anymore 
 Doesn't mean I won't have doubt anymore, 
 Doesn't mean I won't have fear anymore, 
 Doesn't mean I won't have heartache no more, 
 I'm alive, so alive 
 God from forever, until forever 
 You are God, You are God, You are God, You are my God 
 Let me exalt You, let me exalt you, let me exalt you, oh Lord!

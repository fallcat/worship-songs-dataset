Seems like I spent the past three years, 
 Just struggling with these ideas. 
 And the more I learn, 
 The less I really know. 
 But to the things I do, I will hold tight. 
 Because I didn't win them 
 Without a fight. 
 It's all I have and I'm not letting go. 
 I've never been less perfect than today. 
 Is my heart or is my mind 
 What's in the way? 
 I'm listening with nothing left to say. 
 Savior make this dimness fade away. 
 Confusion comes so easily. 
 Like cancer, it kills gradually 
 And you can't recall 
 When the light began to fade. 
 But I'll grab truth with both my hands, 
 Hold it close til' I understand, 
 Face the light and will not be afraid. 
 I've never been less perfect than today. 
 Is my heart or is my mind 
 What's in the way? 
 I'm listening with nothing left to say. 
 Oh, Savior make this dimness fade away. 
 Fade away 
 I'm so much stronger 
 Than I was just yesterday. 
 Fade away 
 I can see clearly now. 
 Lord, make this dimness fade away. 
 Fade away 
 I'm so much stronger 
 Than I was just yesterday. 
 Fade away 
 I can see clearly now. 
 Lord, make this dimness fade away. 
 I've never been less perfect than today. 
 Is my heart or is my mind 
 What's in the way? 
 I'm listening with nothing left to say. 
 Oh, Savior make this dimness fade away. 
 Fade away 
 I'm so much stronger 
 Than I was just yesterday. 
 Fade away 
 I can see clearly now. 
 Lord, make this dimness fade away. 
 Fade away 
 I'm so much stronger 
 Than I was just yesterday. 
 Fade away 
 I can see clearly now. 
 Lord, make this dimness fade away. 
 Fade away 
 I'm so much stronger 
 Than I was just yesterday. 
 Fade away 
 I can see clearly now. 
 Lord, make this dimness fade away. 
 Fade away 
 I'm so much stronger 
 Than I was just yesterday. 
 Fade away 
 I can see clearly now. 
 Lord, make this dimness fade away.

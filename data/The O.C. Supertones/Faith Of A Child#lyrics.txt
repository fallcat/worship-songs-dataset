Can you count all the things 
 That I'm worried about 
 By the lines in my brow, 
 I want to trust but don't know how 
 To rest and be still, 
 To abandon myself to your will 
 And I can't figure out 
 What my time in this world is about 
 And this time I don't have an answer 
 But don't think that I haven't tried 
 I still have the heart of a seeker 
 But I need the faith of a child 
 Oh, I need the faith of a child 
 I know Christ waits for me on the other side 
 Of this life, But I, I wanna know why I'm alive 
 'Cause I wonder from the path so far 
 Would it be easier, easier to be where you are 
 I wanna know what the truth is 
 And I don't care if its costly 
 I know there must be a reason 
 Even if it cannot be known by me

My little sister 
 I want to tell you 
 I want to show you 
 What you're really worth 
 In the beginning when you were first made 
 When you were first formed 
 Before your birth 
 The sea and the sky were not enough 
 The flowers bloom was not enough 
 The mountains reaching to the sky were not enough 
 You're beautiful far more beautiful 
 Than anything the world will ever know 
 Keep you're eyes on the King 
 Cherish all of your tomorrows 
 Daughter don 
 t grow up too fast 
 Let your youth last 
 Because soon its gone 
 Daughter you're far too precious 
 To waste your priceless kiss on just anyone 
 The Lord has made you sweet and wild 
 You are heaven's little child 
 You're the one whose face has a launched a thousand smiles 
 Mother, you're still a pretty girl 
 Your arms surround the world with your embrace 
 Mother I see your wisdom 
 Your tears and laughter 
 In the lines on your lovely face 
 And your children one by one, will rise up and call you "blessed" 
 And all heaven will applaud as you enter to your rest

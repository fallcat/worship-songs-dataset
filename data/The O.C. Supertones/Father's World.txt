The only way I know is just to rip it 
 Oc west coast never comin' with a slick hit 
 Everything is low-fi the music makes me so high 
 Comin' from my heart just like I first came out of long i 
 As the seconds go by allow me just to speak my 
 Thoughts on many topics all pertaining to the most high 
 As the music rocks on just let me get my rock on 
 The preacher gets his talk on we all get our walk on 
 The whole thing is just lovely so beautiful it's ugly 
 Gather like a rally put it down for southern cali 
 This is my father's word whoa let me ne'er forget 
 That though the wrong 
 Seems so strong 
 He is the ruler yet 
 The supertones rock your world 
 Supertones rock your car 
 We got mad plans like hannibal or just george peppard 
 That's a reference to the a-team 
 The dream team with the sure shot 
 If you will allow us we'll break you out like murdock 
 Rockin' is my occupation 
 I could blow for longer than the birth of a nation 
 If there's ever been a question of my dedication 
 Tremble now before the power of my vibration 
 Let me keep this very simple every sould is a temple 
 Who gets the glory there the prince of the air 
 Or maybe your career 
 Whom is it that you fear not fear like a gun 
 But like the heat of the sun 
 If you fear God then you're wise keep your eyes on the prize 
 Learn to tell the truth from lies live with no compromise 
 I like the sound of that now keep yourself on track 
 Against the tide like luther and we'll never take it back 
 In this world there will be trouble 
 And there will be trials but don't fibe up the struggle 'cause 
 It's only for a while

Dawn brings another day, living in Babylon 
 Here I am the enemy so I battle on 
 And I'm tired of the struggle man, don't know how I'll take more 
 The only thing keeping me, is what I'm fighting for 
 'Cause here in Babylon you better watch your back 
 You never see your shooter till you hear the click clack 
 So I keep my eyes peeled and my faith in God 
 While I'm lookin' out the window for the black bag squad 
 Gotta fight on, till one last dawn 
 For one more night 
 All right, all right 
 Twilight in Babylon, I wake with the setting sun 
 The revolution starts now, we will rise as one 
 We're at war but we CELEBRATE! we wait for the Son of Man 
 I wait until midnight, then activate the plan 
 The trumpet will sound and the broad walls crack 
 Then we hit the lights and the city goes black 
 There's no escape no escape at all on the day when Babylon the great will fall 
 Every day its death or glory 
 Every day they're searching for me 
 I'm a one man counter culture 
 Burn it all down leave it for the vultures

Here is a question, 
 Who are the pure? 
 What is the thing you're livin' for? 
 The world says to grow up 'cause nothin' is true, 
 What I believe is right for me, and what you believe is right for you 
 Some call it a new day, I call it the ice age 
 They believe in nothing 
 We believe in one thing. 
 They're afraid to be inspired, 
 All that we desire is fire, 
 Same old deception in a brand new disguise. 
 What's good and evil? 
 You decide, 
 God says who he is, 
 And no one is higher, 
 God is true while men are liars. 
 God dosn't change with your desires, 
 The they get defensive, 
 Truth is so offensive. 
 They believe in nothing, 
 We believe in one thing. 
 Afraid to be inspired, 
 All that we desire is fire, 
 Fire is faith and passion, 
 Fire is tranformation, 
 So do you wanna cool it? 
 Fan the flame when it glows, 
 They're afraid to be inspired, 
 All that we desire is fire.

I don't care if you ever hear this, 
 And every cheering voice goes silent 
 I don't care for the words of critics 
 So man just save your judgments 
 I believe in a God that's listening 
 I believe in a truth worth telling 
 I believe that the stars are singing 
 We only want to join in 
 And what I thought important 
 It doesn't seem to matter 
 Our purpose our mission 
 Is to say that... 
 This is for the glory of God 
 This is for the risen King 
 Who conquered death and hell 
 That's the story we must tell 
 This is for the glory 
 Man I don't know the future 
 I've never been a prophet 
 But one thing I can tell you 
 Is this microphone's a pulpit 
 And I'll speak it till I'm breathless 
 When no one sees I'll praise Him 
 Thy kingdom power glory 
 Will ever be my anthem

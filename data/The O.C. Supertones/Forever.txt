I've never had this feelin' 
 Like someone really loves me 
 But Jesus truly loves me 
 It's got my mind reeling 
 I found the information 
 In lyrics David penned 
 His savior and his friend 
 His love's without condition 
 I know it sounds improbable 
 But nothing is impossible 
 God's love goes on 
 Forever, forever, forever, forever, 
 Forever, forever, forever, forever, 
 Forever, forever, forever, forever, 
 Forever, forever, forever, forever. 
 Love has always left me 
 As quickly as it came 
 But this is not the same 
 God never will forsake me 
 Me, I'm so unfaithful 
 God I don't deserve it 
 Receive it and be grateful 
 It's difficult to think of 
 Something with no ending 
 Not only everlasting 
 God has no beginning 
 Beyond my comprehension 
 Too wonderful to feel it 
 To wise men He's concealed it 
 And to a child revealed it

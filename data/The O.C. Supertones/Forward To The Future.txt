It all went by so fast 
 I'm always looking back 
 On some golden day 
 But nothing gold can stay 
 Older yes and wiser some 
 I am what I have become 
 But am I becoming what I want to be 
 And as we go on with the rest of our lives, 
 Don't forget from where you came 
 Look forward to the future 
 What you wanna be 
 Look forward to the future 
 Grace, integrity 
 Look forward to the future 
 The things you want to do 
 Look forward to the future 
 Faith and honesty 
 Wistful as a wish 
 I sit and reminisce 
 On people that I knew 
 And old friends that I miss 
 Older, yes and wiser some 
 Looking at how far I've come 
 But is where I'm going where I want to be

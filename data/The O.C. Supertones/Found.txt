Paul was walkin' on the road to Damascus 
 A big bright light and the Lord came and asked him 
 Darkness to light, come follow Me 
 And after he was blinded, he could finally see 
 I once was lost, 'til the Lord came in 
 He captured my heart and took away my sin 
 And now I'm living for Jesus 'cause of all He's done 
 God gave mercy through His only Son 
 And then He found me

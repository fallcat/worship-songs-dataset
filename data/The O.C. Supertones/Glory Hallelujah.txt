Well the whole world is singin' 
 And the night sky testifies 
 But man doesn't understand 
 His purpose is to glorify 
 I won't sit around while my life is passin' by 
 I might not get it right 
 But I'm gonna try 
 So now my heart is poundin' 
 And my mind is on the same page 
 I don't wanna be like everybody my age 
 The stones will be cryin' out 
 If I shut my mouth 
 Before they can do it 
 I wanna beat 'em to it 
 Jesus here I am 
 Comin' to you from a broken man 
 We're gonna sing Sweet Glory Hallelujah 
 I just wanna stand 
 Get up and shout and raise my hands 
 We're gonna sing 
 Sweet Glory Hallelujah 
 Well it's high time you and I were livin' with a passion 
 This time maybe we can turn our talk into action 
 I won't sit around while 
 My life is passin' by 
 I might not get it right 
 But I'm gonna try 
 I got my eyes wide open 
 And my soul is on fire 
 And I need a little music 
 That'll take me higher 
 The stones will by cryin' out 
 If I shut my mouth 
 Before they can do it 
 I wanna beat 'em to it

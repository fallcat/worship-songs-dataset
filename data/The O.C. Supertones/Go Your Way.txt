Not long after my rescue 
 I let my failures get me down 
 My sin had robbed me of the joy I had in you 
 Then you saved me from that too 
 All I wanna do is talk about Your grace 
 I don't wanna go unless I go Your way 
 Get a little closer to You everyday 
 I'm gonna turn around and go Your way (X2) 
 What I thought of as my freedom 
 Was a prison without walls 
 I held on tightly to the shackles that I hate 
 But this wasn't freedom at all 
 I thought that I'd gone too far 
 Then I heard You call my name 
 Return to me child 
 I am eager to forgive 
 But leave behind the chains (X2)

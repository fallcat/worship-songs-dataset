Soul, what's wrong? 
 Why are you troubled here within me? 
 Deep inside my heart, my soul, what's wrong? 
 So my God I do not see why You forgive me 
 Do You need me? Am I wise? Am I strong? 
 So Why, so why, so why, so why? 
 Why do You even love me? 
 Why do You even care? 
 Why should You think of me? 
 Oh my God, I'll never know. It's 
 Unconditional love, Unconditional love, Unconditional love, 
 The grace flood 
 Take my hand and lead me further up within here 
 Deep within Your heart, With in your soul 
 On my knees as I crawl steady up the incline 
 The glory of Your face and I can't stand.

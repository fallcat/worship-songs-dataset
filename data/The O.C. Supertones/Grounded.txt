I strike back like the empire 
 And we'll televise the revolution. 
 What will save you 
 From divine retribution? 
 Do our part, try to make a contribution. 
 Playing at 11, givin' OC noise pollution. 
 Think long and hard 
 About our world today.... 
 What needs to be said, 
 And what I need to say. 
 We're a tower of Babel 
 Built on anti-philosophy, 
 Nietzche in the west 
 And Krishna in the east. 
 War rages on through generations. 
 All of these Christians 
 Abandoned their stations. 
 A whole world around us, 
 That we've ceased to reach. 
 An army of soldiers, 
 We've neglected to teach. 
 But, it's dim and not pitch black. 
 The truth will prevail. 
 If our God is for us, how can we fail? 
 No surer hope has ever been rested. 
 But for our adversary's worthy, 
 Prepare to be tested. 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 How will you stand 
 If you don't understand? 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 Fight like a man, Scriptures in hand. 
 And here we stand..naked, barehanded. 
 Futily prepared 
 For the blows to be landed. 
 Presuppositions is all you can stand. 
 Can you twist their wrist 
 When they lay a hand on? 
 Learn how to fight 
 From words on a paper. 
 Learn from the shoguns, 
 Bahnsen and Schaeffer. 
 Invincible army 
 Holy Spirit our general. 
 Weapons are formed 
 From most precious of minerals. 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 How will you stand 
 If you don't understand? 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 Fight like a man, Scriptures in hand. 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 How will you stand 
 If you don't understand? 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 Fight like a man, Scriptures in hand. 
 Kids in universities, 
 Drowning in an ocean 
 Of apostate philosophy. 
 We need apologetic instruction... 
 Mental reconstruction 
 Ignorance reduction, 
 To halt the mass abduction. 
 Evangelical mind 
 Has been scandalized. 
 Wisdom and truth 
 Have been vandalized, 
 By the unevangelized. 
 No truth in the world 
 That is randomized. 
 Expose the lies 
 No matter how they're disguised 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 How will you stand 
 If you don't understand? 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 Fight like a man, Scriptures in hand. 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 How will you stand 
 If you don't understand? 
 Hoo, Hah. 
 Fight like a man, Scriptures in hand.

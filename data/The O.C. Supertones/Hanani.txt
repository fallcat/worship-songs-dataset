Change me into what you want to, hardened as this clay might be. 
 You're the potter, I'm the vessel. 
 Make me what you want of me. 
 Please forgive my obstination, so seldom on my knees. 
 And I will keep it to a whimper, as the great physician works in me. 
 Hanani, here am I. 
 Hanani, here am I. 
 Father, make me like the Savior. 
 All my hope is found in Him. 
 Help me just reach resignation. 
 Hanani Lord, work in me. 
 Please forgive my obstination, so seldom on my knees. 
 And I will keep it to a whimper, as the great physician works in me. 
 Hanani, here am I. 
 Hanani, here am I. 
 Please forgive my obstination, so seldom on my knees. 
 And I will keep it to a whimper, as the great physician works in me. 
 Hanani, here am I. 
 Hanani, here am I. 
 Hanani, here am I.

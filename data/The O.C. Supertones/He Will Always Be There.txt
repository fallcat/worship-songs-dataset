Who am I that You would pay me mind? 
 Who am I that You would take the time to find me? 
 Who am I that You'd reach out your hand? 
 Lord what am I but just a sinful sinking man? 
 I didn't even know who God was, until He told me He's my Dad 
 And it's just because He loved me 
 And He'd rather die than live without me 
 He loved me and He'd rather go through hell 
 Than go to Heaven without me 
 And I love Him and I'll stay with Him until the end of time 
 One thing I know-God gave His life for mine 
 He will always be, will always be 
 He will always be there! 
 Who am I that You would know my name? 
 Who am I that You'd help me win this losing game? 
 Who am I that You'd stay all day by my side? 
 God I fail but at least you know I tried 
 I didn't even know who He was, 
 Then God told me I'm His son! 
 I count on God, I love Him best 
 He helps me through my trials and tests 
 He'll always be there when I call 
 Always catch me when I fall 
 He will always be there!

Poor men bound in persecution, 
 God's their portion everyday. 
 But we don't know anybody who lives that way. 
 There the church grows stronger, under politics and chains and whips. 
 They can't explain how they slipped right through their grip. 
 A purifying persecution in the politics of Mao Tse-Tung. 
 I think they got it right, so maybe we got it wrong. 
 Health and wealth, we help ourselves, and let them play the hand that they've been dealt. 
 Health and wealth, indulge ourselves, a big fat belly underneath our belts. 
 Health and wealth we help ourselves, and let them play the hand that they've been dealt. 
 We'll never understand the Christ they're felt, if we keep on chasing health and wealth. 
 Here we sit so comfy, rich us, me and you, the USA...so far away from C-h-i-n-a. 
 We think they need freedom. 
 We're the ones in prison. 
 We don't have the time to change the world. 
 It doesn't take long to figure it out, where all our money goes. 
 We're the poorest billionaires 
 Jesus knows. 
 Health and wealth, we help ourselves, and let them play the hand that they've been dealt. 
 Health and wealth, indulge ourselves, a big fat belly underneath our belts. 
 Health and wealth we help ourselves, and let them play the hand that they've been dealt. 
 We'll never understand the Christ they're felt, if we keep on chasing health and wealth. 
 And we ask God to refine us and pray that we would be freed from all our comfortable gods our straining and striving and chasing the wind. 
 Health and wealth, we help ourselves, and let them play the hand that they've been dealt. 
 Health and wealth, indulge ourselves, a big fat belly underneath our belts. 
 Health and wealth we help ourselves, and let them play the hand that they've been dealt. 
 We'll never understand the Christ they're felt, if we keep on chasing health and wealth.

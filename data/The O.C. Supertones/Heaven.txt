There's no tears in my eyes today 
 I've only got good things to say 
 The Son chased away the clouds of grey 
 I'm going to Heaven and I'm going to stay 
 All smiles there, no trials there 
 No fears there, no years there 
 I'm going to Heaven 
 We're going to Heaven 
 Our tickets are all paid to heaven that God made 
 So goodbye blue Monday, no pain on SONday 
 I don't need no women or wine 
 When I got Heaven on my mind 
 Be so far above cloud nine 
 You and me and God until the end of time! 
 All smiles there, no trials there 
 No fears there, no years there

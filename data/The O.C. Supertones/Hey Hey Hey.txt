I feel so high and I want to tell the world why 
 Until the glory of the Lord goes world wide 
 And every person on the earth opens their eyes wide 
 And hymns ring from every valley plain and hillside 
 I'm alive I'm alive you know that I'm set free 
 And my eyes get clearer every day 
 I was blind I was blind I was blind but now I see 
 And when my heart is gripped with fear 
 He says son why don't you look up here 
 When I hear those words well I feel scared to death 
 Short of breath but it makes me want to say 
 Enough about me I wanna know how you're doin' now 
 Are there some tough times you're goin' through now 
 Been where you are and I want you to know 
 There's a love that won't let you go 
 That neither life, nor death, nor height, nor depth, no angel, no man, 
 Can take you from His hand

Hold on to Jesus 
 Tell Him about everything 
 Your dreams and your troubles 
 Pure hearts desire one thing 
 And mine is to know You 
 Mine is to break down 
 And shatter to pieces 
 And lose everything I've found 
 I'm learning that nothing worth anything is cheap. 
 I'm learning the path is thin and the grade is steep, 
 And that the altars where we lay ourselves will crack when tested 
 And that there's only one that turns our hearts to gold 
 Hold on to Jesus 
 Tell Him about everything 
 Your dreams and your troubles 
 Pure hearts desire one thing 
 And mine is to know You 
 Mine is to break down 
 And shatter to pieces 
 And lose everything I've found 
 I'm finding that I'm not who I once thought I was 
 I'm finding I'm powerless to obtain Your love 
 And that the only gifts I bring to You are rags and failures 
 And through a strange exchange You've made them myrrh and gold. 
 Hold on to Jesus 
 Tell Him about everything 
 Your dreams and your troubles 
 Pure hearts desire one thing 
 And mine is to know You 
 Mine is to break down 
 And shatter to pieces 
 And lose everything I've found

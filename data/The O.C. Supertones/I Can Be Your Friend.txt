Have you ever seen a boy with funny clothes? 
 A girl with braces on her teeth 
 Or freckles on her nose? 
 Some kids call them odd balls 
 Some kids call them weird 
 Is it my imagination or does your mother have a beard? 
 God makes lots of people 
 In all colors, shapes and sizes 
 He loves them very much and what we need to realize is: 
 That calling people names because they're different is wrong 
 Instead we need to look on them in love and sing this song 
 That's Right! 
 I can be your friend 
 I can be your friend 
 Any day any weather 
 We can be friends and play together 
 We're all pretty different 
 Some are skinny some are stout 
 But the inside is the part were supposed to care about 
 Haha, that's why we have feelings that are very much the same 
 So instead of weirdo I think friend's a better name 
 Yeah! 
 I can be your friend 
 I can be your friend 
 Any day any weather 
 We can be friends and play together 
 I can be your friend 
 I can be your friend 
 If your hair is red or yellow 
 We can have lunch 
 Or share my jello 
 I can be your friend 
 I can be your friend 
 Any day any weather 
 We can be friends and play together 
 I can be your friend 
 I can be your friend 
 It's OK if we are different 
 We can still play 
 'Cause I can be your friend

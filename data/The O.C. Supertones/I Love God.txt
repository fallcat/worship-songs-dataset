Gotta give me something that will last 
 Someone that won't judge my past 
 Give me a future that is bright 
 Open my eyes to the light 
 I love God and God loves me 
 He sets the chosen people free 
 I love God and God loves me 
 He sets the chosen people free, today 
 He is the way the truth and light 
 He is the way I'll say I'm right 
 He gives me hope and He gives me peace 
 His grace and love will never cease

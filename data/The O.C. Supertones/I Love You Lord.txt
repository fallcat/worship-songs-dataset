These aren't just some lyrics by 1 amazing band... 
 I want to say to you all... I turned my eyes onto Jesus because of this song... 
 I love the Lord... 
 I love you, Lord 
 And I lift my voice 
 To worship you 
 Oh my soul, rejoice 
 Take joy, my King 
 In what you hear 
 Let it be a sweet, sweet sound 
 In your ear 
 We love you, Lord 
 And we lift our hearts 
 To honor you 
 Oh my soul, rejoice 
 Take joy, our King 
 In what you see 
 Let it be a pleasing sight 
 In your eyes

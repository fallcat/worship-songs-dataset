Back in junior high, well, I was a bit wild 
 Pretty safe to say that I was a troubled child 
 Didn't go to Juvie but they had me on file 
 Drinking like a man, but thinking like a child 
 You wouldn't want to know me, man I was a hooligan 
 It was the only crowd who would ever take me in 
 Cared about nothing- that's the loser's way to win 
 I hit the ninth grade and something happened then 
 And it was a sacrifice 
 (Whoa-oa-oa) 
 There are those who give their lives 
 Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know 
 You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 I will follow. 
 I came to know my God first year of high school 
 Not a smart move if you're trying to be cool 
 They knew me as a druggie who wouldn't follow rules 
 My friends didn't get it and they thought I was a fool 
 They called me self-righteous 'cause I wouldn't smoke pot 
 And now I didn't wanna split a bottle of Schnapps 
 Plus I didn't wanna go running from the cops 
 And that's how I lost all the friends I got. 
 And it was a sacrifice 
 (Whoa-oa-oa) 
 There are those who give their lives 
 Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know 
 You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 I will follow. 
 So everyone I knew just thought I was a freak 
 I wasn't hard to tell that they didn't want to speak 
 I used to be cool, but now I was a geek 
 Like drugs are for the strong and God is for the weak 
 Everything I have, well, I gave it to the cross 
 I count it as trash, I don't hesitate to toss 
 What I held dear was a burden to be lost 
 To get to the gold you've got to burn up the dross 
 And it was a sacrifice 
 (Whoa-oa-oa) 
 There are those who give their lives 
 Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know 
 You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 Even if it's only me that goes 
 I will follow.

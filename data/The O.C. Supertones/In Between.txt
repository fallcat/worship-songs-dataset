Please allow me to introduce me 
 Half of me slave, the other half free 
 Righteous and sinful, 
 Both at the same time. 
 Iniquity and purity 
 Fill up the same mind. 
 And out of the same mouth, 
 The holy and profane. 
 I curse all my brothers, 
 Then I bless Christ's name. 
 I hang in the balance 
 But still I'm secure 
 I'm leaning towards evil, 
 But striving to be pure. 
 I stand between the saint and the 
 Sinner, chasing after holiness, close 
 Enough to grasp, but still it's just 
 Beyond my reach. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am. 
 Pulling from both sides, 
 Humility and pride 
 One seeks to give, 
 The other to be gratified. 
 In any case, however, 
 I know I'm in need. 
 Two appetites in me, 
 Which one do I feed? 
 Running fast as I can 
 After elusive perfection. 
 No I'm not there yet, 
 But sure I'm in the right direction. 
 Cuz I see me at the end 
 And I look glorified. 
 Justified safe inside, 
 So I seek to be sanctified. 
 I stand between the saint and the 
 Sinner, chasing after holiness, close 
 Enough to grasp, but still it's just 
 Beyond my reach. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am. 
 Who I am is in between, 
 What I wanna be and what I am.

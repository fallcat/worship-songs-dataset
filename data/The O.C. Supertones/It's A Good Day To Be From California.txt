Way out west where I come from 
 Every single trunks got a sound system 
 On the 15 singin' my anthem, California here I come 
 I remember sittin' on the beach beneath the stars 
 Singing to the Lord a hymn of praise on my guitar 
 It's a good day to be from California 
 Shout three cheers for the golden state 
 It's a good day to be from California 
 I'm going back to Cali and I can't wait 
 There's where I got my first tattoo 
 That's the church where I heard the good news 
 There's the school where I used to go 
 That's where the tones played our first show 
 There's the beach where we would go for dawn patrol 
 We'd paddle out through the freezing waves as they would roll 
 And I'd float out on the ocean 
 It's like God pulled back the curtain 
 I wanna go back, by the train tracks, 
 In the soft sand and just sit back

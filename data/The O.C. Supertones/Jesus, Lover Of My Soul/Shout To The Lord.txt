 Lord, there is none like You 
 All of my days, 
 I want to praise 
 The wonders of You're mighty love 
 My comfort 
 My shelter 
 Tower of refuge and strength 
 Let every breath 
 All that I am 
 Never cease to worship You 
 Shout to the Lord, 
 All the Earth, 
 Let us sing 
 Power and majesty, 
 Praise to the King 
 Mountains bow down, 
 And the seas will roar 
 At the sound 
 Of Your name 
 I sing for joy 
 At the work of Your hands 
 Forever I'll love You, 
 Forever I'll stand 
 Nothing compares 
 To the promise I have 
 No, nothing compares 
 To the promise I have 
 No, nothing compares 
 To the promise I have 
 In You

5 am on Tuesday 
 Why am I up so early 
 Drive out to Santa Ana 'cause I've got jury duty 
 No breakfast short tempered 
 And I cut my head shaving 
 Ten miles out I hit traffic 
 Some days just aren't worth saving 
 You know I haven't had the best of days 
 But I want to stop and thank you anyway 
 At the courthouse I waited 
 And waited then I waited 
 At lunchtime my car stalled out 
 I couldn't get it started 
 Had a book by c.s. lewis 
 I finished the last page and 
 Slept on my desk for three hours 
 Just like my high school days 
 'Cause every single moment whether sleeping or awake 
 Is your creation 
 And what you've made is good 
 I don't always thank you for the rough days and 
 The hard times in my life 
 Even though I should 
 Got home and decided I'd be in a bad mood 
 My shy and quiet wife said she didn't like my attitude 
 Got a call from my mother 
 Forgot my sister's birthday 
 I'm a lousy older brother safe to say I've had a bad day

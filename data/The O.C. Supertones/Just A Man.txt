I'm not a punk 
 I'm not a rocker 
 Or a rude boy 
 Republican or democrat 
 White or black 
 None of that 
 That's not what I am (2 x's) 
 I'm not a Jew 
 I'm not a goy 
 Or an American 
 Can't even call myself my own 
 No I'm not a Supertone 
 That's not what I am (2 x's) 
 I'm just a man 
 God's own reflection 
 I'm just a man 
 That's what I am 
 I'm just a man 
 His son by adoption 
 I'm just a man 
 That's what I am 
 I'm not a Jew 
 I'm not a goy 
 Or an American 
 Can't even call myself my own 
 No I'm not a Supertone 
 That's not what I am (2 x's) 
 That's what I am (2 x's) 
 That's who I am 
 I'm just a man 
 God's own reflection 
 I'm just a man 
 That's what I am 
 I'm just a man 
 God's own reflection 
 I'm just a man 
 That's what I am 
 I'm just a man 
 His son by adoption 
 I'm just a man 
 That's what I am 
 All right!

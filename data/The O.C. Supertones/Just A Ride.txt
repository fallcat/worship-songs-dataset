Life, it's ever so strange 
 It's so full of change 
 Think that you've worked it out 
 Then B A N G 
 Right out of the blue 
 Something happens to you 
 To throw you off course 
 And then you 
 Breakdown 
 Yeah, you breakdown 
 Well, don't you breakdown 
 Listen to me because 
 It's just a ride, it's just a ride 
 No need to run, no need to hide 
 It'll take you 'round and 'round 
 Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down 
 It's just a ride, it's just a ride 
 Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes 
 It may feel so real inside 
 But don't forget it's just a ride 
 Truth, we don't wanna hear 
 It's too much to take 
 Don't like to feel out of control 
 So we make our plans 
 Ten times a day 
 And when they don't go 
 Our way we 
 Breakdown 
 Yeah, we breakdown 
 Well, don't you breakdown 
 Listen to me because 
 It's just a ride, it's just a ride 
 No need to run, no need to hide 
 It'll take you 'round and 'round 
 Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down 
 It's just a ride, it's just a ride 
 Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes 
 It may feel so real inside 
 But don't forget it's just a ride 
 Slowly, oh, so very slowly 
 Except that there's no getting off 
 So live it, just gotta go with it 
 'Cause this ride's, never gonna stop 
 Breakdown 
 Don't you breakdown 
 No need to breakdown 
 No need at all because 
 It's just a ride, it's just a ride 
 No need to run, no need to hide 
 It'll take you all around 
 Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down 
 It's just a ride, it's just a ride 
 Don't be scared now, dry your eyes 
 It may feel so real inside 
 But don't forget, enjoy the ride

I, I, I, I've noticed how you've been withdrawn 
 Everybody's asking where you've been 
 The only time you call me back 
 Is to tell me you'll be staying in 
 I don't know what is in your heart 
 But trust me God knows what is there 
 But how can I be here for you 
 If you won't tell me why you're scared 
 Talk to me, 
 What is wrong, 
 Tell me what's been goi'n on, 
 Have you fallen back again? 
 Where sin is fat but faith is thin 
 Let it go, 
 Let it go, 
 It's not worth the pain and the shame so just let it go 
 I, I, I, I'm sorry but I think you're dumb 
 To let your soul have grown so numb 
 I understand I've been there too 
 But God is still in love with you 
 It's so hard to swallow pride 
 When you're stuffed with sin inside 
 Pride puffs up but never fills 
 And satisfy it never will 
 Talk to me, 
 What is wrong, 
 Tell me what's been goi'n on 
 Have you fallen back again? 
 Where sin is fat but faith is thin

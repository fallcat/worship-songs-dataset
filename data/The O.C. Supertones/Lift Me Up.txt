Lord, my god, in the morning 
 Show me how I can serve you today 
 Lord, my god, in the evening 
 Let my song rise up to you. 
 I know that you are holy, 
 I know that I'm unclean 
 And I'm afraid to come into your presence. 
 I know that I'm unworthy, 
 To call upon your name 
 From all the way down here. 
 So I say 
 Lift me up 
 From my lowly estate 
 Lift me up 
 Where I can see you clothed in majesty and light 
 (Repeat) 
 If you'd saved even one man 
 Surely this is undeserved 
 But the saints by your mercy 
 Stand with you uncountable 
 Is this not amazing 
 Isn't your name grace 
 Aren't you the sovereign God of justice 
 Haven't we offended 
 Did we not crucify 
 Guess that we can only wonder why 
 So I say 
 Lift me up 
 From my lowly estate 
 Lift me up 
 Where I can see you clothed in majesty and light

This is a time for us to demonstrate our appreciation 
 Amazing grace and sweet salvation 
 I can't pay you back, my Lord, so I won't even try 
 I will give you I and i 
 You know when I'm standin' up and when I'm falling down 
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound 
 And you know if I'm hungry, tired, or feeling kind of low 
 Why you care, I just don't know 
 I cast all my life and all my cares and everything on you 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 This is a time for us to celebrate our emancipation 
 Voices ring across the nation 
 There will never be another, there has never been 
 Helpless and you took us in 
 Because of Jesus Christ, we know salvation is secure 
 I don't worry anymore 
 Who can give you council, Lord, and who can search your mind? 
 You're before me and behind 
 I cast all my life and all my cares and everything on you 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 Every time I shed a tear, it matters, it matters 
 Every time I'm cold with fear, it matters, it matters 
 When I got a broken heart, it matters, it matters 
 Every time I fall apart, it matters, it matters 
 When I think I'm all alone 
 On the road or when at home 
 Every time I have to sneeze 
 Every single breath I breathe 
 When I'm in the dentist's chair, it matters, it matters 
 Anywhere and everywhere, it matters, it matters 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else 
 He cares for you like no one else

Keep both my eyes transfixed on the prize 
 A high-rise to the blue skies my piece of the pie 
 There's a hole in my heart that I know how to fill 
 That's to light my cigarettes with a hundred dollar bill 
 It's all about cash flow the California dream 
 To make the grade you gotta make the green 
 My friend I'm the champion I've no time for losers 
 Never ask for nothin' 'cause beggars can't be choosers 
 Lookin' our for number ones's a full time occupation 
 I'll give to me myself and I my own salvation 
 Some people try to tell me God can save me from my sin 
 But God can take a number and I'll pencil Him in 
 Busy oh so busy I got no time to search 
 My Sunday's are all booked I've got no time for church 
 That's for those poor souls, dry as a stone 
 God bless this child 'cause this child's got His own. 
 Oh, let my pride fall down I'm a little man 
 He who gets the most toys and dies is the winner 
 I'm livin' the high life with lobster tail dinners 
 My Lexus, my yacht, my gold chains and rings 
 These are a few of my favorite things 
 But most of all I keep my billfold the closest to my heart 
 House decorated with million dollar works of art 
 Roll with the Bigwigs they think I'm the man 
 But then I stop and look and think about how big I really am 
 Mammon is an unforgiving God, I cast him away 
 I live my life to God, not to get paid 
 Money can't save your soul, don't think I can 
 I look to God and I feel like a little man.

I know I'm just another Judas, kiss Your face 
 While I drive the nail in Your hand 
 I know I'm just another Thomas, won't believe 
 Until I feel the hole in Your hand 
 Then I will say, my God, 
 I see not what You see 
 My God, what do You see in me? 
 My God, crowned in glory 
 The Lamb of God is worthy 
 My sin yell, "Crucify!" Louder than the mob that day 
 My sin yell, "Crucify!" louder than any mouth. 
 I know I'm just another Judas, kiss Your face 
 While I drive the nail through Your hand 
 I know I'm just another Thomas, won't believe 
 Until I feel the hole in Your hand

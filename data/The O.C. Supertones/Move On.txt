Well, I been thinkin' 'bout the future 
 Too young to pretend 
 It's such a waste to always look behind you 
 Should be lookin' straight ahead 
 Yeah, I'm gonna have to move on 
 Before we meet again 
 Yeah, it's hard, if you had have only seen 
 10:34, Flinders Street Station 
 I'm lookin' down the tracks 
 Uniformed man askin' am I paid up 
 Why would I wanna be that? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna have to move on 
 Before we meet again 
 Yeah, it's hard, if you had have only seen 
 Take control, don't be afraid of me 
 'Cause every once in a while 
 Think about if your gonna get yourself together 
 You should be happy just to be alive 
 And just because you just don't feel like comin' home 
 Don't mean that you'll never arrive 
 Yeah, I'm gonna have to move on 
 Before we meet again 
 Yeah, it's hard, if you had have only seen 
 Take control, don't be afraid of me

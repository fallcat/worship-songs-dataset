(Where you from?...Orange County 
 That's right 
 Orange County SUPERTONES in the house 
 Full of effect 
 Ready to bust some rhymes out 
 We're a dance band from the Southland 
 So come up front and dance while we sing...) 
 We ain't got no place to go 
 Let's go to the rudeboy show 
 I wanna hear them play it rude 
 Gonna pop some rudeboy attitude 
 You know I get up when I hear and then He found me 
 You know I'm safe and sound with my rudeboyz all around me 
 Well the SUPERTONES are up, we gonna kick it to the burbs 
 And our purpose is to serve, in case you hadn't heard 
 Fater, Son, Spirit, hear it, near it, fear it 
 Father, Son and Holy Spirit 
 God's alive and He's here right now, here right now 
 He's in love with you 
 I hope that's clear right now, clear right now 
 That's just life down in Southern California 
 That's just life in Orange County California 
 Well if you used to be a Christian then you never was 
 Just sittin' up in Church and sayin' what a Christian does 
 The world's got the gun, but the devils' got the trigger 
 Stand strong with faith, deeper than a t-shirt or a sticker 
 You probably ask yourself, "How'd this Jew boy get so crazy?" 
 Came from kickin' mad knowledge, didn't come from being lazy 
 We got the rhythm and the rhythms got roots 
 I'm a crazy little Hebrew on stage wearin' monkey boots 
 I love to be onstage and sing and bimskalabimmin' 
 I love to be out in the croud a skankin' and a swimmin' 
 King David, my great grandfather, was a dancer 
 King Solomon, my great grandfather, a romancer 
 Jesus came from Jesse, but Jesse came from Jesus 
 Now come to Lord Jesus 'cause Lord Jesus frees us! 
 That's just life down in Southern California 
 That's just life in Orange County California 
 (Orange County, huh?)

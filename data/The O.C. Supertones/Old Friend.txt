What do I know? Somebody tell me. 
 I've been running from you for so long. 
 Please help me Lord. 
 Find my direction. 
 I just can't do it on my own. 
 You lift me up. You rescue me. 
 It's good to be with You, old friend. 
 You lift me up. You rescue me. 
 It's good to be with You, old friend. 
 Sometimes I think, how can You love me? 
 My thoughts are so far from Your own. 
 Why choose me Lord? 
 I'm a poor reflection. 
 Why use me to make Yourself known? 
 You lift me up. You rescue me. 
 It's good to be with You, old friend. 
 You lift me up. You rescue me. 
 The cross You bore on Calvary 
 You lift me up. You rescue me. 
 It's good to be with You, old friend.

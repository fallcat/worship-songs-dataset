You say you got your problems, well I got an idea 
 God is on your side so you bring 'em in here 
 And let love drive out your fear 
 Front door kick it in let 'em know it's dancing time 
 Back door beat it down we don't want to wait in line 
 No rows no seats everybody on your feet 
 Smash it up smash it up, meet me at the downbeat 
 We're on the downbeat! 
 Get on the downbeat 
 This sound relieves stress, so the beat is medical 
 Our purpose is to worship, so the beat is spiritual 
 Tell me do you believe in miracles 
 We're bopping like a blitzkrieg piling in the backseat 
 Party till we're fatigued, generating steam heat 
 No rows no seats everybody on your feet 
 Smash it up smash it up 
 Meet me at the downbeat

Spoken: 
 Hey 
 Hey 
 Hey 
 Hey oh 
 1999 and the stakes is high 
 Our options have come down 
 To either we do or we die. 
 We need You now more than ever. 
 Pull out all of the strife in the church, 
 Get us together. 
 Is time running out? 
 I can't say I do know. 
 We have one day less 
 Than we did yesterday. 
 So it's up to us to unite, 
 You wanna fight the power? 
 You need the power to fight. 
 And can we sing with one voice 
 If we all love the same God? 
 Can we agree to disagree? 
 And so we cry with one voice 
 To the only God in all the universe- 
 Who holds us in His hands. 
 No more time 
 For us to bicker and complain. 
 If we're called by the same name, 
 There's nowhere for us to lay the blame, 
 Except for ourselves. 
 And if we died to our old selves 
 To come alive as God's flesh 
 That makes us family 
 Deeper than death, 
 But we don't act so tight 
 When there's a back to bite. 
 Are we less like a family, and 
 More like a fistfight? 
 Are we there, but not quite 
 Are hypocrites children of light. 
 And can we sing with one voice 
 If we all love the same God? 
 Can we agree to disagree? 
 And so we cry with one voice 
 To the only God in all the universe- 
 Who holds us in His hands. 
 And can we sing with one voice 
 If we all love the same God? 
 Can we agree to disagree? 
 And so we cry with one voice 
 To the only God in all the universe- 
 Who holds us in His hands.

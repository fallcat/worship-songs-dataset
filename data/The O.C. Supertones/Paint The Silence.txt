How can you say your life is empty? 
 So late in the day 
 Why would you stay another second? 
 Now your sight got in the way 
 A combination of love and aggression 
 Another second lived 
 Don't paint the silence black now save me 
 (Paint the silence) 
 Don't leave it a day 
 You got a right to stand or die so maybe 
 (Paint the silence) 
 You take chances all the same 
 Pain comes in stages, if we don't make it 
 Nothing changes 
 Now the violence sleeps inside 
 Abandoned feelin' for just a piece of mind 
 It's the reason why your teethin' side frustrates me 
 Now the violence sleeps inside 
 Abandoned feelin' for just a piece of mind 
 It's the reason why your teethin' side irates me 
 Don't leave me to pick up on your questions 
 (Paint the silence) 
 Not even a day 
 It's alright to finish up your sentence 
 (Paint the silence) 
 You talk all the same 
 Pain comes in stages, if we don't make it 
 Nothing changes 
 Now the violence sleeps inside 
 Abandoned feelin' for just a piece of mind 
 It's the reason why your teethin' side frustrates me 
 Now the violence sleeps inside 
 Abandoned feelin' for just a piece of mind 
 It's the reason why your teethin' side irates me 
 Paint the silence 
 Paint the silence 
 Now the violence sleeps inside 
 Abandoned feelin' for just a piece of mind 
 (Paint the silence) 
 It's the reason why your teethin' side frustrates me 
 (Paint the silence) 
 Now the violence sleeps inside 
 Abandoned feelin' for just a piece of mind 
 (Paint the silence) 
 It's the reason why your teethin' side irates me 
 (Paint the silence)

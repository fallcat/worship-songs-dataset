Pick your poison 
 Pseudo-christian, Neo-Orthodoxy, false philosophy 
 Triple-x pornography, LSD, PCP, self idolatry 
 Listen you can hear the laugh of Mephistopheles 
 'Cause once you start it's so very hard to cease 
 To say the least it's hard enough to keep it from increase 
 That's the box you can never close it once it's open 
 You can't contain what's inside once the seal is broken. 
 Who knocked the locks off of Pandora's box 
 Praise apostate while they mock the orthodox 
 Who knocked the locks off of Pandora's box 
 Pandora's box Pandora's box 
 The box was opened first by Adam and Eve 
 Forbidden fruit tasted and planted the seed 
 Grew up into hatred, lust and greed 
 The pain of Cain and his devious deed 
 It permeates society circling like a vulture 
 The lid's flung wide and we call it our culture 
 That's the box you can never close it once it's open 
 You can't contain what's inside once the seal is broken

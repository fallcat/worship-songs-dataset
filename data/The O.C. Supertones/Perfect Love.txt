Do you need someone? 
 Are you like me? 
 Do you fall apart? 
 You're just like me. 
 Have there been times? 
 You felt so low? 
 Don't you forget 
 You're not alone 
 Angels are standing by your bed 
 Jesus is watching over you 
 He'll never leave that's what he said 
 Is that what you want 'cause I know I do 
 I want love love love 
 I want perfect love. (X3) 
 Well I pretend 
 I just need me 
 I seem so strong 
 But it's make believe 
 'Cause I've seen love fail 
 I've been betrayed 
 I've seen love pass 
 I've seen love fade 
 But I know that God is not that way 
 He doesn't change from day to day 
 He doesn't fail he doesn't leave 
 And I want that so desperately 
 He loves broken hearts 
 Faith like a child 
 And now here I come 
 With just a broken heart 
 And faith like a child 
 I want love love love 
 I want perfect love. 
 I want love love love 
 I want perfect love. 
 Will someone tell me where to find 
 Some place to ease my troubled mind (X2) 
 I want love love love 
 I want perfect love.

Hey! 
 Let me drown in an ocean of devotion 
 Let my joy be in service and love my emotion 
 Let me be closer than your right hand 
 Tighter than your left hand and let me be a Godly man 
 Till the day I die, Till the fire's just smoke 
 I will go for broke till my last word's spoke 
 If I limp then I will run with a limp 
 I'll win some and lose some, but I'll make my attempt 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 I will keep fighting to the knockout, even if I'm knocked out 
 Hitting hard, I'm hittin' for the belt 
 My soul will keep going till my body buckles 
 I will drop my bloody knuckles 
 Carry us to Heaven by the truckfulls 
 I will be as stubborn as a pitbull 
 Neutral as a nazi, resolute like Gandhi 
 I will keep preaching till I'm took out 
 Till I'm in Heaven en route 
 No sell out 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 Hey! 
 Let me drown in an ocean of devotion 
 Let my joy be in service and love my emotion 
 Let me be closer than your right hand 
 Tighter than your left hand and let me be a Godly man 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus 
 Last breath before the candle flickers out 
 I will speak the name of Jesus

I was just nineteen I had my first pocket full of some money 
 So I called up Sid and I got a tattoo on my arm 
 Then I got a sound system for my 1970 Chevy 
 To get that old school knockin' like my trunk was settin off bombs 
 It wasn't long before my money was gone 
 It was a pretty little lie 
 But it didn't satisfy 
 When I was 21, I was young I was dumb and successful 
 I had a new hit record and a pretty little thing on my arm 
 It was all I'd ever wanted I was ready to feel fantastic 
 But every single night when I would step on that stage and perform 
 With every breath I felt emptiness 
 And now fast forward to my undeniable failure 
 I didn't have nothin' but Jesus and a blue collar job 
 I was scared that everyone would think that I was a loser 
 But I never felt surer that I was in the presence of God 
 To my surprise I felt satisfied

All down the AM and all up the FM 
 Tired of hearin' songs about nothin' at all 
 Beauty that's skin deep 
 Love that comes so cheap 
 They're singin' so pretty 'bout nothin' at all 
 All day long I hear the same 5 songs and the words go 
 Blah Blah Blah 
 The radio plays a whole lot of nothin' 
 Wish that they'd play a song about somethin' 
 'Cause all that you hear is so insincere 
 But it's comin' in crystal clear 
 Perfect production without interruption 
 And everybody loves it because it sounds so sweet 
 They glorify sin 
 They sell sex 
 And then they all say Jesus in their thank you speech 
 All day long I hear the same 5 songs and the words go 
 Blah Blah Blah

 This is Hi-Fi Revival FM 
 We got the Supertones marathon, 
 All Supertones radio, all the time 
 God gave us music so we should use it 
 To sing with all our heart about the way you feel 
 Sing about love or whatever you think of 
 It doesn't really matter Just make it real 
 All day long I hear the same 5 songs and the words go 
 Blah Blah Blah 
 (Ending) 
 The radio plays a whole lot of nothin' 
 Wish that they'd play a song about somethin' 
 'Cause all that you hear is so insincere 
 But it's comin' in crystal, crystal 
 So loud and clear!

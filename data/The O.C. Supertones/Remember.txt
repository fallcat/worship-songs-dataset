What am I to do now 
 And what have you shown 
 I'll never make it 
 On my own 
 I look up and I see blue sky 
 And a shining sun 
 I'm simply reminded 
 How you love 
 I'll remember your faithfulness 
 Through all my days 
 Your light, love, and hope always 
 You're the great maker 
 Of Heaven and Earth 
 The souls of men 
 Are your greatest work 
 When I see your image 
 In every face 
 I'm called to remember 
 Your good, good grace 
 I'll remember you're patient 
 I'll remember you're true 
 I'll remember all the times that you came through 
 You made this blind man see 
 Thank you for saving me 
 Jesus, you made me new 
 I live my life you 
 Your light, love, and hope always 
 Your light, love, and hope always

I've meant to do this for some time 
 I've gotta get it right this time 
 This time my God I will be Yours, 
 All my heart, my soul, and mind 
 Been so long since I truly smiled 
 But You touched my heart today 
 Reached through my mind of mud and mire 
 Consumed the idols in Your way 
 So I am brand new 
 Today, I make my resolution 
 Today, I make my resolution 
 Today, I make my... 
 Today, I make my resolution 
 Today, I make my... 
 Looking back the way I used to be 
 Been down so long that is seems like up, 
 I took it now I've had enough 
 Of the life that I've been livin' 
 It feels so cold this far away 
 So today I will make a change 
 I will make a change today 
 Purge my mind of mud and mire 
 Cast all my gods away 
 It was just me and God 
 Can I be there again? 
 (Ending) 
 Today I make my resolution. 
 Today I make my resolution. 
 Today I make my... 
 Today I make my resolution. 
 Today I make my... 
 Today I make my resolution.

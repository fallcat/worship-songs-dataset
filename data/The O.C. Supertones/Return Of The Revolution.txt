There ain't no stopping us now 
 I'd like to say that from the outset 
 Not up in this business just to get what we can get 
 But bet that 
 We gonna bring it to you loud and clear 
 How loud I gotta say it 'fore you people start to hear 
 I can name our problems 
 But I know a solution 
 Bring back the revolution. 
 The revolution comes and we all stand as one 
 Rises from the darkness and shines like the sun 
 As the sun gets higher, our church catches fire 
 Down from our pride and up from the mire. 
 It's a dream that I've had and I hope it comes true 
 I forgot to say the revolution starts with you. 
 See wisdom and knowledge is one thing that we lack 
 You've been a Christian how long and you're still on Similac 
 So I call on Martin Luther and all the reformation back 
 Then the common people couldn't read God's revelation 
 You had to be a monk or a priest or read Latin 
 That was all before the revolution happened 
 But the fire cooled down ever since that generation 
 We put down the Bible and pick up the Playstation 
 And we can't defend our faith 'cause we don't even know it 
 We say we love his word but pick a funny way to show it. 
 The world walks by and we don't have a thing to say 
 I call 'em as I see 'em 
 And that's what I see today 
 The revolution returns 
 The reformation lives on 
 The great awakening is now 
 Sleepers open your eyes 
 A war is on, our rally cry is no compromise 
 No compromise, yeah, no compromise 
 A war is on, our battle cry is no compromise 
 So throw your fist up and pray the revolution rise 
 A war is on, our rally cry is no compromise 
 Our hearts have grown so cold 
 And we've such numb souls 
 But shirts and bumper stickers 
 Man we got 'em by the truckload 
 Is true religion what you have around your wrist 
 What does the scripture say of this 
 "They honor me with words 
 But their hearts are far away" 
 I call 'em like I see 'em 
 And that's what I see today 
 So I call on John Edwards 
 Who preached us all awake 
 We try to be emotional but here is our mistake 
 As a church we lack repentance and we lack true affection 
 Not only in our minds but our hearts need correction 
 And man that's true religion, resignation and contrition 
 To love each other so much that we'd die before division 
 So what about you 
 Will you join us 
 Will you admit that the waters around us have grown 
 You better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone 
 Do you stand with us or do we stand alone 
 It's time that we stand up, enlist for the war 
 I've tasted battle and now I want more 
 I've known the truth and been cut to the core 
 But I'm back in the game to even the score 
 And I mean to go out with both my guns blazing 
 Amazed at a God who's so truly amazing 
 To triumph in battle as the spirit enables 
 Can't turn back the clock but we can turn the tables

So what becomes of those small unwanted souls 
 Who spend their lives breaking their backs? 
 Those who dig the gold for the rich and powerful 
 Who place their feet upon their necks? 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 Do you understand 
 That God became a man? 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 Where can the junkies go when high has laid them low? 
 Are they truly on their own? 
 It seems we've lost our way 
 Like sheep we have gone astray 
 Can anybody lead us home? 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 Do you understand 
 That God became a man? 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 Do you understand 
 That God became a man? 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 Who is the champion? 
 The friend of the suffering? 
 Of those who were never born? 
 The King with the crown of thorns 
 And I'll consecrate a verse 
 To the kingdom in reverse 
 Where the least are most 
 And the last will be the first 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 Do you understand 
 That God became a man? 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb 
 Do you understand 
 That God became a man? 
 The Shepherd is the Lamb

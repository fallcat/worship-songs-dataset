Religious fanatic, that's what they say 
 True, I may be on the brink 
 I hear them yell at us, "Shut up and play!" 
 Well, who asked what you think? 
 No time for mediocricy, convenience, or practicality 
 He went all all out for us, say what you will 
 I'll answer to my God. 
 I'm a freak, they say I've lost my mind 
 But I know I've never seen so clearly 
 When I speak, they say I've gone too far this time 
 Which lets me know, I have not gone nearly. 
 Bible thumpin' reactionist 
 And I'm proud to bear the name 
 Take our music, take away our lives 
 Jesus still remains 
 I wonder what will people think 
 When why hear that I'm a Jesus freak

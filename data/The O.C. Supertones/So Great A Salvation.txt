Woke up this morning 
 And I just had to thank God for my life 
 Just read through James' book 
 Start to pray and I ask God for a wife* 
 It's a time of devotion 
 As I sit and speak to my God unseen 
 Why should He listen? 
 Well I love Him and He's in love with me 
 Why me God? Why should You choose me? 
 On your team God, can You use even me? 
 I think a few years back 
 On a road that headed to nowhere 
 Now that You found me 
 I can see that You were always there 
 So great a salvation 
 But to You my Jesus what am I worth? 
 It's quiet times like this 
 I feel I get a glimpse of Heaven right here on earth 
 Why me God? Why should You choose me? 
 On your team God, can You use even me? 
 Oh, hold me in your arms of love 
 Sometimes I swear I feel your heartbeat 
 I could never ever thank You enough 
 But here's my life for whatever it's worth 
 *This line can either be:

 Or

We're back there and the heartbreak came 
 Yeah it hit me pretty hard 
 I waved hello and goodbye 
 To the ghosts on the boulevard 
 Well oh, oh my baby 
 You're so sweet it makes me cry 
 Well oh, oh my baby 
 You're so sweet it makes me cry 
 You're so sweet, you're so sweet 
 You're so sweet, I wanna cry 
 La, la, la 
 Well I dealt with the dog face honey 
 Just try to sympathize 
 Well he turned and looked at me 
 With his cold debaler, red, dry clean eyes 
 Oh, oh my baby 
 You're so sweet it makes me cry 
 Well oh, oh my baby 
 You're so sweet it makes me cry 
 You're so sweet, you're so sweet 
 You're so sweet, I wanna cry 
 La, la, la 
 You're from my love is leavin' 
 Check it out not coming back 
 The downtown trains are teamin' 
 Screamin' all down the track 
 There is a terrible taste 
 Always torn from the chemicals 
 He's gonna split his blood 
 All over the whole wide world 
 You're so sweet, you're so sweet 
 You're so sweet, I wanna cry 
 La, la, la 
 La, la, la 
 La, la, la

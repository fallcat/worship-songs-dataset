You make me lose my buttons, oh yeah you make me spit 
 I don't like my clothes anymore 
 We're spending time and money, yeah you're colder than yourself 
 Now we're moving now we're taking control 
 You make me lose my buttons, oh yeah you make me spit 
 I don't like my clothes anymore 
 You take me to New Orleans where you put me to the test 
 I know what my heart is for 
 You reach out for blanket I say girl you've got something 
 I love how you wear it 
 Now we're spending time and money, yeah you're colder than yourself 
 Now we're moving now we're taking control 
 Love will get you down 
 My love's a laboratory I set all my pets free 
 So baby you should sleep with me 
 I make trips to the bathroom, yeah my friends all have true grit 
 I am speckled like a leopard 
 Put a lid on Shirley Temple, yeah you make sleek kills 
 Yeah you travel you travel 
 You park me in your buick, you sing songs into my lips 
 Well I am speckled like a leopard, just like a leopard 
 Trust will get you down, I love the way 
 You put me in the big house, I love the way 
 You put me in the big house 
 If I get there early will it be the right time 
 Our heaven is just waiting so put your hand into mine 
 If I get too surly will you take that in stride 
 Our boat is just there waiting so put your little hand in mine 
 And speak when you're spoken of, catch up on your sleep girl 
 When you wear that body glove 
 You're acting on initiative and you're spelling out your love 
 You shouldn't be alone in there, you could be above ground 
 All I want is to be the very best for you 
 All I want is to be the very best for you 
 Oh this time, there'll be no life of crime 
 Don't rain on me tonight 
 Circle around me now baby it'll be okay 
 'Cause we all go downtown sometimes 
 Somehow baby we'll beat this mess 
 It's the time fuck the surface to meet the specialist 
 Time away from me will get you down 
 I love the way you put me in the big house 
 I love the way you put me in the big house 
 If I get there early will it be the right time 
 Our heaven is just waiting is just waiting so put your hand into mine 
 If I get too surly will you take that in stride 
 Our boat is just there waiting so put your little hand in mine 
 And speak when you're spoken of, catch up on your sleep 
 When you wear that body clock 
 You're acting on initiative, you're spelling out your love 
 You shouldn't be alone in there, you could be above ground 
 If you're frustrated then go 
 If you're frustrated then go 
 Honey bee, we should be through with this 
 Your packaged eyes, your vicious lips 
 You could be young, but you're out of touch 
 If this loves been done, then what's your rush? 
 I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote 
 Why don't you come into my barrio we'll see if you can float 
 I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote

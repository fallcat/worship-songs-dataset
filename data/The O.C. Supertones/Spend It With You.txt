Had an old friend call me up this morning 
 Telling me about how he had changed 
 His life's not the same 
 Warning me about a place 
 So far away from heaven's grace 
 And how life is no simple game 
 I thought about it, laughed out loud 
 Only fools would dare reject it 
 I decided to just accept it 
 I thought about it and I sang this song 
 Thought about the day when 
 I'd be singing to you all day long 
 'Cause I wanna spend it with you 
 I wanna live in the service of heaven 
 I wanna spend it with you 
 From eternity to forever 
 Got another call from a friend this morning 
 Telling me I didn't have to wait 
 Till I walked through the gates 
 That heaven's with me everyday 
 And every step along the way 
 I take with me takes 
 I thought about it, laughed out loud 
 How much better could this get 
 I've barely even started yet 
 I thought about it and I smiled so wide 
 Now I can spend everyday walking close to Jesus' side 
 'Cause I wanna spend it with you 
 I wanna wake up and say good morning 
 I wanna spend it with you 
 I wanna know in your heart that you're with me 
 Called up my old friend this morning 
 Telling him about how I had changed 
 My life's just not the same 
 Warning him about a place 
 So far away from heaven's grace 
 And how life is no simple game 
 He thought about it, he laughed out loud 
 Only fools would dare reject it 
 He decided to accept it 
 He thought about it and said that he 
 Only wished I didn't wait 
 To call him up and tell him this 
 'Cause I wanna spend it with you 
 I wanna walk streets of gold together 
 I wanna spend it with you 
 From eternity to forever

Supertones strike back 
 Like Leia's Father 
 You hit, we hit back harder 
 Like Huss and Stephen, I am not afraid to be a Martyr 
 California sun and sky 
 Slip inside a suit and tie 
 Chevy rolls up to the house with everybody outside 
 Gonna get down like we did the day before 
 50 more people be waitin' at the door 
 Team against team, let's even the score 
 If there's 50 people outside, 
 We got room for 50 more! 
 And we're movin' all smooth and when we get groovin' 
 We're fresh like salsa and we're fat like juben 
 You're cranium's cracked from my Shaolin attack 
 Protect your neck, Supertones strike back! 
 We want this whole band to be a big love letter 
 So we play the ska and it makes you feel better 
 God's got love for us, so we got love for you 
 It's your life, so what you wanna do? 
 So come on put a glide in your stride, and a dip in your hip 
 Best back the heck up, 'cause hip-hop rolls from my lips 
 I spit when I rap, saliva flies when I sing 
 God gives me gifts, just look at my ring 
 Look less at me and look more to Christ 
 His grace has saved me and His grace will suffice us 
 So I jump for Jesus, it's Jesus who frees us 
 Let's get dumb like Beavis, I don't care who sees us 
 When we hop to hip-hop 
 John Bell gets ill props 
 You know he can rock socks 
 Give out love from his soapbox 
 With hip-hop nonstop, hippidie, hippidie, hop 
 First I can rock them socks, then I can knock your block 
 You can't stop this, you can't clock this 
 You can't dis this, so please don't miss this 
 A van and a roadmap, keep my life in my backpack 
 Comin' through your town, Supertones strike back

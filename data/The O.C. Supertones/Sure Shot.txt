I wanna do the right thing. 
 I wanna be the sure shot. 
 I wanna have my mind straight. 
 I wanna have my point got. 
 I wanna be a good man. 
 I wanna have my act down. 
 I wanna be the future and I wanna be right now. 
 Sometimes I feel like I could change the world. 
 But I don't know where to start. 
 I dig and come up empty, clutching an empty heart. 
 I wanna see a life change. 
 I wanna see a new man. 
 I wanna fight the good fight. 
 I wanna take the right stand. 
 I wanna be like Jesus. 
 I wanna pour my heart out. 
 I wanna pick my cross up. 
 I wanna hear the mob shout. 
 I'm wide awake and thinking about the cross, the Trinity apart. 
 I dig and come up empty, clutching an empty heart. 
 I wanna do the right thing. 
 I wanna be the sure shot. 
 I wanna have my mind straight. 
 I wanna have my point got. 
 I wanna be like Jesus. 
 I wanna pour my heart out. 
 I wanna pick my cross up. 
 I wanna hear the mob shout. 
 Sometimes I feel like I can change the world. 
 But I don't know where to start. 
 I dig and come up empty, 
 I'm wide awake and thinking about the cross, the Trinity apart. 
 I dig and come up empty, clutching a sacred heart.

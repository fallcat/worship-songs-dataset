We get high in back seats of cars 
 We break into mobile homes 
 We go to sleep to shake appeal 
 Never wake up on our own 
 And that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 And that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 We go out in stormy weather 
 We rarely practice discern 
 We make love to some weird sin 
 We seek out the taciturn 
 And that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 Oh, that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 That's the way we get by 
 Way we get by, way 
 And that's the way we get by 
 That's the way we get by 
 We found a new kind of dance in a magazine 
 Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen 
 You sweet talk like a cop and you know it 
 You bought a new bag of pot, said, let's make a new start 
 And that's the way to my heart 
 The way to my heart 
 That's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 That's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 And that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by, way 
 That's the way we get by 
 That's the way we get by 
 We get high in back seats of cars 
 We put faith in our concerns 
 Fall in love to down, on the street 
 We believe in the sum of ourselves 
 I said, that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 Oh, that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by 
 And that's the way we get by 
 Way we get by, way 
 And that's the way we get by 
 That's the way we get by

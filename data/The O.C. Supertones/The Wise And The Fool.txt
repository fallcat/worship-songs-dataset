Who is the wise man? 
 He is the one who loves the law of God and treasures it away 
 He is a tree that's planted where a river flows 
 Not so the foolish 
 He is the one who says "there is no god" but he does not understand 
 That ruin waits along the path of every foolish man 
 The wise man or the fool, which one will you choose? 
 As for me, I will hear 
 As for my house, we draw near 
 As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord 
 Who is the righteous? 
 He is the one who walks the way of the Lord 
 Who makes his footsteps sure 
 In the right hand of the Most High he will ever dwell secure 
 Not so the wicked 
 He is the one who says "God does not see" 
 What does the Most High know 
 He is a man who like chaff in the wind will blow 
 The wise man or the fool, which one will you choose? 
 As for me, I will hear 
 As for my house, we draw near 
 Lift your ears, turn and hear, who and what your life is for 
 As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord

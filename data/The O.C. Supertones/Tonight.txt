I can feel the old earth shake tonight 
 Mother earth feels labor aches tonight 
 I can feel the old world passin' 
 I can hear the whole world crashing down tonight 
 And if I died here tonight, I know my soul is with You 
 I'm sure about the promises You've made 
 Surely then I will be judged tonight 
 Surely I'm a little scared tonight 
 Surely now the sheep and goats are split upon the 
 Threshing floor tonight 
 Lord, You are my only good, I will hold to You 
 Should the fires of hell sear and singe me 
 Lord, You are my protector 
 I will hold to the fold of your robe 
 Should the devil himself come to claim me

I was listenin in to your transmission (I hear it every night, hear it every night) 
 I think there was a problem with my reception (on my satellite, on my satellite) 
 It seemed like a section of my soul was having trouble with the signal 
 I was trying but it just wasn't pickin' up 
 I guess the frequency was stuck 
 And my heart corroded shut 
 I couldn't tune in to the station that was telecasting my salvation... 
 But I wanna hear it now 
 And sing along again 
 I just don't know how 
 I lost that frequency but now it's coming in. 
 Yeah it's coming in! 
 In a room full of doubters You were the sure one. (You were like a light, You were like a light) 
 In a town of compromises, You are the pure one. (I think You got it right, I think You got it right) 
 It was water to my soul to hear You singing so honest and simple 
 I seek to be sophisticated, 
 But I make it complicated 
 I over elaborated but now that I have contemplated 
 I'll write about the love of Jesus and his mercy that never ceases 
 And I wanna hear it now 
 And sing along again 
 I just don't know how 
 I lost that frequency but now it's coming in. 
 Yeah it's coming in! 
 It was foolish to be jaded that the cross was intgraded 
 I remember Jesus said you either love it or you hate it 
 I didn't know the words in my heart I was singing with You 
 And I wanna hear it now 
 And sing along again 
 I just don't know how 
 I couldn't find it then 
 And I wanna hear it now 
 And sing along again 
 I just don't know how 
 I lost that frequency but now it's coming in.

I'm having trouble sleeping 
 You're jumping in my bed 
 Twisting in my head 
 Leave me 
 I'm having trouble breathing 
 You're sitting on my chest 
 I sure could use the rest 
 Leave me 
 It's you 
 Why's it always you and never me? 
 I've never dared to let my feelings free 
 Why's it always you and never me? 
 I've never cared too much about honesty 
 I'm having trouble sleeping 
 I'm thinking of what you said 
 About the tears been shed 
 Leave me 
 It's you 
 Now and always you but never me 
 I've never dared to let my feelings free 
 Why's it always you and never me? 
 I've never cared too much about honesty 
 It's you 
 Now and always you but never me 
 I've never dared to let my feelings free 
 Why's it always you and never me? 
 I've never cared too much about honesty

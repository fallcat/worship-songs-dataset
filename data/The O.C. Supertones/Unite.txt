Live and undrugged six years and countin' 
 Believer in Christ, Yes, yes, the blessed fountain 
 Apologetic warrior, chalk one up for the visitors 
 Casting fiercesome light into the shadows of midnight 
 To the underground we descend 
 With our whole generation to defend 
 Got a whole army on my case, Got the devil in my face 
 'Cause that punk knows when's the end 
 Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright the 
 Sight will blind the blind of this our modern time. 
 O yeah, I got a beef with the fence-sitters 
 Tiers among the wheat, the cop-outs, the quitters 
 Cut from the branch fruitless, no good, 
 Only one use and that's firewood 
 Pay no mind to the generation line 
 Forsake your sect and be color blind 
 The problem's not Hollywood, the problem's not Washington 
 The problem's a weak divided church of schizmed Christians. 
 Never going back the the darkness I was damned in 
 Now I turn my back on the place that I was found in 
 Flick a match on Babylon, burn baby burn 
 Raised my mind for all this time and now it's your turn 
 Got enough gasoline and plenty o' matches 
 Finally I'm free and I shake off the ashes 
 From the city of refuse, I refuse to pay dues 
 To you, not me, and none of the free and the few.

Killin' ourselves faster than fast 
 Livin' in the future, livin' in the past 
 I haven't always been in Christ 
 I know what you're goin' through, man 
 A couple of years ago I was just like you 
 Lookin' for answers, but lookin' to myself 
 Thinkin' that Christians just love Jesus for their health 
 But, I didn't know about Jesus 
 I tried to be like God, but when I tried I failed 
 And every time I fail, and fail 
 I know I rail a nail straight into the cross of Jesus 
 Straight into the wrist of Jesus 
 And now it's 1996, a hard year to be a Godly man 
 It seems the more I speak The Word, the less they understand 
 You gotta know about Jesus

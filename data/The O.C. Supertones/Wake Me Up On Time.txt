The trumpet sounds like a worldwide alarm clock. 
 The dead rise, this might come as a shock. 
 The day the grave will be unlocked. 
 I've seen so many turn away, the one's had no doubt. 
 If you've been around, you know what I'm talking about. 
 On fire, but now they're burning out. 
 Don't they know that this is a long road. 
 The race we run's a marathon. 
 And all I want to say, 
 Is I'm not here to stay. 
 Life ends and I don't mind, 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Do you ever think about what you'll become? 
 The reason why it's not a game but a race we run. 
 Who reigns are those who overcome. 
 You don't have to finish first, just stay on track. 
 Turn not right or left but straight up the path. 
 There are those who run that will turn back. 
 When Jesus goes, are you gonna follow? 
 Even when you feel you can't go on. 
 And all I want to say, 
 Is I'm not here to stay. 
 Life ends and I don't mind, 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 And all I want to say, 
 Is I'm not here to stay. 
 And I don't care as long, 
 As I can finish strong. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 (Ending) 
 Just wake me up on time. 
 Just wake me up on time.

Winter was long 
 Stuck in a never ending December 
 My heart turned cold 
 But when it did I cannot remember 
 I never really felt the chill 
 Until the spring came back to me 
 A single day has broke its will 
 I finally feel that I am free 
 I feel your love in the warmth of the sun 
 Spreading across my shoulders 
 I feel your love in the warmth of the sun 
 Winter is finally over 
 I hear the song 
 Pouring forth ever since the creation 
 The whole world long 
 Everyday and night they've been singing 
 Your glory grows up from the earth 
 Its in the blowing of the wind 
 Its in the shining of the sun 
 That thaws the hardest hearts of men 
 So let the world pour forth its praise and 
 Brother sun pour forth your rays through 
 Sacred night and blessed day

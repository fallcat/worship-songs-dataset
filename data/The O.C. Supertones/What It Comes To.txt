Every now and then I have a moment of authentication 
 Reveals the man inside me like illumination 
 Trial by fire purification 
 The day I die is the day that it's done 
 You might not realize when it comes 
 And only overcome it by the grace of the Son. 
 Just try to stand your ground take it head on 
 Every moment in my life comes down to this one 
 At a fork in the road only two ways to go 
 The one untraveled and the one that you know 
 The broad and the wrong or the tight and the right 
 So die in the dim or fight in the light 
 So it comes down to this 
 Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss 
 Judas when he faced his moment he failed 
 Imprisoned in hell with a bail of three nails 
 This is what it comes to 
 It's me against my desires and inclinations 
 Pass through the fire into salvation 
 Bring water to the thirsty like irrigation 
 When you go toe to toe you don't go one on one 
 But Christ in my place in substitution 
 Showed me His grace's propitiation 
 Heard the devil laugh and he thought he had won 
 But then came the comeback and resurrection 
 Listen everybody may I please have your attention 
 Only the wise will accept instruction 
 Fools laugh at knowledge and reject wisdom 
 Inevitably leading to destruction 
 Now it's on you it's your decision 
 The forecast of the future is confrontation 
 The beast or the King like revelation 
 A battle for your soul like armageddon

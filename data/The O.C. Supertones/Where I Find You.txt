Well I messed up, feel like I can't even lift my eyes up 
 Covering this stain that I'm ashamed of, the way I take advantage of your love 
 And I'm terrified, stand before your throne with blood on my hands 
 I realize it's only by your blood that I can 
 I knew that is where I'd find you 
 I don't have to remind you of all the times I've failed you 
 I knew that is where I'd find you 
 So this is where I've come to, there's nothing else I can do 
 I'm confessing I'm up to my ears in transgression 
 Is this the way I thank you for a blessing? 
 I know it's hard to tell but I'm am trying 
 So here I am with nothing to say for myself 
 Once again, to plead the blood and nothing else 
 I knew that is where I'd find you 
 I don't have to remind you of all the times I've failed you 
 I knew that is where I'd find you 
 So this is where I've come to, there's nothing else I can do 
 So here I am with nothing to say for myself 
 Once again, to plead the blood and nothing else 
 I knew that is where I'd find you 
 I don't have to remind you of all the times I've failed you 
 I knew that is where I'd find you 
 So this is where I've come to, there's nothing else I can do

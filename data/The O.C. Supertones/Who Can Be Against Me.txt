It seems like everything I touch just falls to pieces 
 It seems like everyone I help just falls 
 And how I need someone to make me feel assured 
 I don't need anyone if You're on my side, Lord 
 And I say, hey, who can be against me? 
 No matter how hard I try I always fail 
 I'll never be like Christ 
 I know I'll struggle until the day, the very day I die 
 And how I need someone to make me feel assured 
 I don't need anyone if You're on my side, Lord 
 And I say, hey, who can be against me? 
 God look at me, I'm just a man 
 But You tell me I'm not just a man 
 You're so hard to understand, after all I'm just a man 
 God you tell me not to doubt 
 But I'm always plagued by doubt 
 And You always help me out 
 I'm so ashamed (of my doubt)

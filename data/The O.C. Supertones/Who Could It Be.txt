Let me introduce you to somebody that I know 
 I first met him, oh, I'd say about nine years ago 
 But he knew me before the day that I was born 
 He planned my life when the world was void of form 
 He chose to save my soul before earth's foundations 
 Reigns from heaven as we speak and rules over the nations 
 The one and only god-man at the father's right hand 
 The height the length the depth tell me if you understand 
 The one and only undefeated champion 
 The only one who did what can't be done 
 The only one who can insure saint's persistence 
 Who swallowed up death in his infinite existence 
 Omnipotent infinite blood sufficient for what ails ya 
 Makes scores of saints sing praises like mahalia 
 Vital signs were flat lined in the earth three days time then 
 He rose again and ascended like sunshine 
 Who could it be who could it be the person of the trinity 
 Between one and three j-e-s-u-s c-h-r-i-s-t 
 Feared on every continent banned by many governments 
 Raise your voice against him and reveal your own 
 Incompetence 
 Many people hate him many people love him 
 Many far below him but you know there's none above him 
 Now there is an issue where I must turn my attention 
 It seems that people wish to serve a Christ of their invention 
 True God true man otherwise you're anathema 
 Unsaved hell bound with a hellhound after ya 
 Deity one in three existing from eternity 
 Humiliated lacerated now reigning in glory 
 The comeback king of all time 
 No matter how dark it gets the truth shines 
 'Cause in the heart of every man lies the knowledge of him 
 Displayed in creation but suppressed in sin 
 Don't believe me check out romans one to three 
 Still disagree you best check your theology

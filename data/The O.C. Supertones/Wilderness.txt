The rain falls on the righteous and the wicked 
 Mine is not to reason why this is 
 In this I rest in this I find my refuge 
 That my thoughts and ways are not His 
 I spend my life on looking up the answers 
 It's rare that I can't find a reason why 
 But reasons fail at children without mothers 
 His plan is more than I can know 
 Have you ever held in doubt 
 What this life is all about 
 Have you questioned all these things that seem important to us 
 Do you really wanna know 
 Or are you a little scared 
 You're afraid that God is not really exactly what you'd have Him be 
 What should I hold to and what should I do 
 How do I know if anything's true 
 I'm somewhere in-between Canaan and Egypt 
 A place called the wilderness 
 I'm not one who always trusts their feelings 
 I don't believe in what you'd call blind faith 
 But faith that you can do all that you promised 
 And you said it all works for good 
 It's safe to say I don't see the big picture 
 I can't see the forest for the trees 
 And if five hundred lives 
 Were mine to get to know 
 You all could be spent on just this 
 God do you really understand what it's like to be a man 
 Have You ever felt the weight of loving all the things you Hate 
 Have You struggled have you worried 
 How can You sympathize 
 I have spoken too soon put my hand over my mouth 
 I can't contend with You 
 Your ways are so much higher 
 And we pass through the fire that Christ endured before us 
 When You were in the wilderness

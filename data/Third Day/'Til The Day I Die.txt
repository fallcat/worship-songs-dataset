I wanna tell you 
 I wanna tell you just how I feel 
 I will show you 
 I will show you my love is real 
 Nobody's ever gonna love you like I am 
 You never can deny that 
 Nobody's ever gonna hold you like I am 
 I'll love you 'til I die 
 Until the day I die 
 I said "forever" 
 I said "forever" and I mean it 
 I made a promise 
 And I intend to always keep it 
 Forever is so far beyond the reach of my mind 
 So I'll give all I have, my heart, my love, my life

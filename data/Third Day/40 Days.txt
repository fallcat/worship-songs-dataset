Here I am at what feels like the end 
 So I come to you, my Lord, again 
 With this burden buried deep within 
 This heart that you have made 
 And in this trial that I'm going through 
 I don't question 'cause I know it's true 
 That the sorrow brings me back to you 
 And you have made me stronger 
 It's been 40 days and 40 nights 
 Down the road of many trials 
 And I pray it's only for a season 
 'Cause in the wilderness and in the flood 
 You're the one I'm thinkin' of 
 'Cause I know you've brought me for a reason 
 I have one more thing I've got to say 
 Before they try to take my life away 
 Let it be known that I am not afraid 
 Let your will be done, Lord

I'm what you're looking for 
 No need to search anymore 
 I'm in need of your saving 
 You can give me hope 
 Rescue my wretched soul 
 You are the one I am praying 
 I am just like the alien the fatherless and the widow 
 I am just like the alien the fatherless and the widow 
 Keep your watch over me 
 Sustain the life in me 
 Frustrate the ways of every wicked man 
 Let me inside your home 
 Father defend my cause 
 Plead for my case and my innocence 
 I am just like the alien, the fatherless and the widow 
 I am just like the alien, the fatherless and the widow 
 Just like the alien 
 I'm a stranger in a strange land 
 Just like the Fatherless 
 I'm in need of someone to take my hands 
 Just like the widow 
 I need you right now to understand 
 And save me, won't you save me' 
 Won't you save me' 
 Won't you save me' 
 I am just like the alien, the fatherless and the widow 
 I am just like the alien, the fatherless and the widow 
 Psalm 146:9, Luke 19:10.

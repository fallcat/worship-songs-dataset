As Your children gather in peace 
 All the angels sing in Heaven 
 In Your temple all that I seek 
 Is to glimpse Your holy presence 
 All the heavens cannot hold You, Lord 
 How much less to dwell in me? 
 I can only make my one desire 
 Holding on to Thee 
 All the angels exalt You on high 
 What a kingdom to depart! 
 But You left Your throne in the sky 
 Just to live inside my heart 
 All the heavens cannot hold You, Lord 
 How much less to dwell in me? 
 I can only make my one desire 
 Holding on to Thee 
 I will always make my one desire 
 Holding on to Thee

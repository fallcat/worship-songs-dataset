Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing over the plains, 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains. 
 Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 What the gladsome tidings be 
 Which inspire your heavenly song? 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
 Come to Bethlehem and see 
 Him whose birth the angels sing; 
 Come, adore on bended knee 
 Christ, the Lord 
 The newborn King. 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
 Gloria 
 Gloria 
 Gloria 
 See Him in a manger laid, 
 Jesus, Lord of Heaven and Earth 
 Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, 
 With us sing our Savior's birth. 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo, 
 In excelsis Deo, 
 In excelsis Deo

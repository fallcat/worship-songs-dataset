I can't do anything 
 I can't do anything without You 
 But You can do everything 
 You can do everything You want 
 I just can't believe 
 I can't believe that You would love me 
 After everything 
 After everything I've done 
 And I want to love You 
 Love You more than life itself 
 And I want to hold You 
 Even though You can't be held 
 Because You're so much more 
 Than everything I've ever known 
 Anything, anything 
 I'd give anything 
 I would give anything to hold You 
 I want to live for You 
 For You alone I want to live 
 When I see Your face 
 I would do anything to know You 
 You gave everything 
 You gave all You have to give 
 And I want to love You 
 Love You more than life itself 
 And I want to hold You 
 Even though You can't be held 
 Because You're so much more 
 Than everything I've ever known 
 Anything, anything 
 Anything 
 And I want to love You 
 Love You more than life itself 
 And I want to hold You 
 Even though You can't be held 
 Because You're so much more 
 Than everything I've ever known 
 Anything

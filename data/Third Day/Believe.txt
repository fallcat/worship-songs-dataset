Never mind all the things you heard about me 
 You're never gonna understand it 
 Every time that I've given you the truth 
 It's never made a bit of difference 
 Disappointment takes you 
 Then the doubt, it breaks you 
 It's enough to make you cry 
 Always looking for a sign 
 Miracles won't change your mind 
 Tell me how much evidence you need 
 Turning truth into a lie 
 Hardened heart and blinded eye 
 All you need to do is just believe 
 Never mind what you think that you had seen 
 It all can change in just a moment 
 Here before you is sall the proof you need 
 Why can't you ever just believe it?

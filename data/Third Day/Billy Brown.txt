Super Star Billy Brown 
 Whatcha doin' to this town? 
 Don't cha know that everybody here 
 Wants to be like you? 
 All of your adoring fans 
 Sitting in the seats and stands 
 Listening to every word you say 
 Once I saw a sign that said Billy Brown for President 
 It ain't easy being a star 
 It ain't easy to be who you are 
 It ain't easy but you're going far 
 Well, you say there's nothing to it 
 But somebody's gotta do it, boy 
 Super Star Billy Brown 
 Everybody's screaming out your name 
 Do they kow the reason why 
 You point your finger to the sky 
 We are all watching and expect 
 That whatever you are doing next 
 Well, it is gonna be the greatest thing 
 That we have ever seen

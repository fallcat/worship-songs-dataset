Blackbird, why you wearing that frown? 
 Don't you know Jesus loves you and me 
 And the preacher on T.V. you're putting down 
 Blackbird, how I love to hear your songs 
 I could spend all of my time in the shade 
 Of the trees and listen all day long 
 Oh yeah 
 I could listen all, all day long 
 But you're ever hearing, never understanding 
 Ever seeing, not perceiving and your heart 
 Has grown callous 
 You're in a storm and lost your way 
 Won't you fly to heaven and be saved today 
 Blackbird, now you've broken your wings 
 You try to fly high but you know that you 
 Can't go anywhere, you can't do anything 
 Blackbird, who put you in your cage 
 Tell me, was it God or was it you 
 Was it me?  I guess it don't matter anyway 
 No, no, it don't matter anyway 
 But you're ever hearing, never understanding 
 Ever seeing, not perceiving and your heart 
 Has grown callous 
 You're in a storm and lost your way 
 Won't you fly to heaven and be saved today 
 Oh, yeah, Blackbird, yeah 
 You say you need a remedy 
 for the thorn in your pride 
 I think it's such a tragedy 
 That you have left Him behind 
 You say you'd light your candle 
 But your love light doesn't shine 
 You say you talk to angels 
 Well I say it's such a lie 
 Yes, it is now such a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie 
 But you're ever hearing, never understanding 
 Ever seeing, not perceiving and your heart 
 Has grown callous 
 You're in a storm and lost your way 
 Won't you fly to heaven and be saved today 
 Oh, yeah, Blackbird, yeah

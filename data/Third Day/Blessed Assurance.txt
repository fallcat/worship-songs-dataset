 All right, you've had a rest.  Now it's time to get up out of your seats. 
 Many of us sang this in church growing up. 
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine! 
 O, what a foretaste of glory divine! 
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God 
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood. 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my story, yeah, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long. 
 Perfect submission, all is at rest 
 I in my Savior am happy and blest 
 Watching and waiting, looking above 
 Filled with His goodness, lost in His love. 
 This is my story, (yeah) this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my story,  (oh yeah) this is my song 
 Praising my Savior (yeah) all the day long. 
 This is my story, this is my song 
 Praising my Savior all the day long 
 This is my song 
 This is my song 
 My song 
 This is my song

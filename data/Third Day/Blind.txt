Each and every single day 
 I was throwing life away with questions 
 Searching for a better day 
 Always looking in the wrong direction 
 My heart I could not trust 
 'Cause it lies to me too much 
 And my mind just couldn't 
 Understand it all 
 How could I have been 
 So blind to not see you? 
 The more that I look the more I find 
 You've led me to the truth 
 That I am nothing if I'm without you 
 You opened my eyes and helped me to find 
 How could I have been so blind? 
 I have fallen once again 
 Evidently made the wrong decision 
 Stumbling in the dark 
 Now I need you here to be my vision 
 My heart I cannot trust 
 'Cause it lies to me too much 
 And my mind just couldn't 
 Understand it all 
 You took my heart and you changed it 
 With your words of life 
 You took my eyes and you opened them 
 And gave me sight

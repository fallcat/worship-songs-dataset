Well, today I found myself 
 After searching all these years 
 And the man that I saw, he wasn't at all who I thought he'd be 
 I was lost when You found me here 
 And I was broken beyond repair 
 Then You came along and You sang Your song over me 
 It feels like I'm born again 
 It feels like I'm living 
 For the very first time 
 For the very first time 
 In my life 
 Make a promise to me now 
 Reassure my heart somehow 
 That the love that I feel is so much more real than anything 
 I've a feeling in my soul 
 And I pray that I'm not wrong 
 That the life I have now, it is only the beginning 
 It feels like I'm born again 
 It feels like I'm living 
 For the very first time 
 For the very first time 
 It feels like I'm breathing 
 It feels like I'm moving 
 For the very first time 
 For the very first time 
 I wasn't looking for something that was more 
 Than what I had yesterday 
 Then You came to me and You gave to me 
 Life and a love that I've never known 
 That I've never felt before 
 It feels like I'm born again 
 It feels like I'm living 
 For the very first time 
 I'm living for the first time 
 It feels like I'm breathing 
 It feels like I'm moving 
 For the very first time 
 I'm living for the first time 
 In my life

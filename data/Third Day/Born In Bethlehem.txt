Baby Jesus, born in a stable 
 A humble Savior's birth 
 You left Your throne in Heaven above 
 To live here on the earth 
 Baby Jesus lying in a manger 
 Crying for the world 
 The angels told the shepherds of 
 The good news for us all 
 Hallelujah, the King is here 
 Given for all men 
 For today, the holy Son of God 
 Is born in Bethlehem 
 Come now sinners and you saints 
 All peasants and all kings 
 And bow before the earth's Redeemer 
 Let all voices sing 
 Hallelujah, the King is here 
 Given for all men 
 For today, the holy Son of God 
 Is born in Bethlehem 
 Hallelujah, the King is here 
 Given for all men 
 For today, the holy Son of God 
 Is born in Bethlehem 
 Oh yeah 
 Baby Jesus, do You know 
 You'll die for all our sins 
 Don't be afraid, for in three days 
 You will rise again 
 You will rise again 
 Hallelujah, the King is here 
 Given for all men 
 For today, the holy Son of God 
 Is born in Bethlehem 
 Hallelujah, the King is here 
 Given for all men 
 For today, the holy Son of God 
 Is born in Bethlehem 
 For today, the holy Son of God 
 Is born in Bethlehem, born in Bethlehem

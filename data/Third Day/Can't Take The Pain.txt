No, I didn't see this one commin' 
 It suddenly snuck up on me 
 I can't say you didn't tell me so 
 I can't say you didn't warn me 
 Well I can't take the pain, 
 Knowing that I left you 
 And I can't bear the shame 
 Of knowing I was wrong 
 But I'll take the blame for everything that I've done 
 But I can't take the pain of leaving you alone 
 Leaving you alone 
 I was there when they accused you 
 But I guess I was too affraid 
 Not just once, and not just twice 
 But three times I denied your name 
 Well I can't take the pain, 
 Knowing that I left you 
 And I can't bear the shame 
 Of knowing I was wrong 
 But I'll take the blame for everything that I've done 
 But I can't take the pain of leaving you alone 
 Leaving you alone 
 I never thought I'd get 
 Even a second chance 
 But you've given that, and so much more 
 And then for every time I ever did deny, 
 You asked me if I love you 
 You know I do, Lord 
 So I'm off to follow in your steps 
 It won't be easy, it's safe to say 
 Only two roads I can walk on down 
 The one less traveled is the one you paved 
 But I can't take the pain, 
 Knowing that I left you 
 And I can't bear the shame 
 Of knowing I was wrong 
 But I'll take the blame for everything that I've done 
 But I can't take the pain of leaving you alone 
 Leaving you alone 
 Lord, you took the pain 
 Even though I left you 
 And you took the shame, and you made it all your own 
 Why'd you take the blame for everything that I've done? 
 Lord, you took the pain, you and you alone 
 You and you alone.

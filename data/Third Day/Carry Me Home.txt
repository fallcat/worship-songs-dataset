My  heart is aching 
 My bones are tired 
 And I can't believe 
 I've fallen down this far 
 My back is breaking 
 My mouth is dry 
 I pray you'll come 
 And rescue me tonight 
 Too many days I've gone through the valley 
 Too many nights I've fallen down 
 Every time I blindly stumble 
 You pick me off the ground 
 And carry me home 
 My will is crumbling 
 On every side 
 I know you haven't 
 Left me here to die 
 My life is shaking 
 And trembling whooa 
 I'm praying that you'll come 
 And cover me 
 Too many days I've gone through the valley 
 Too many night I've fallen down 
 Every time I blindly stumble 
 You pick me off the ground 
 And carry me home 
 My heart is like a stone, oh 
 But you can break it openâ€¦ 
 My will is broken 
 Your will be done 
 I'll follow you no matter what may come 
 Too many days I've gone through the valley 
 Too many nights I've fallen down 
 Every time I blindly stumble 
 You pick me off the ground... 
 I can't believe it 
 Every time I blindly stumble 
 You pick me off the ground... 
 Carry me home 
 Carry me home

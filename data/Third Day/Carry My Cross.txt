As long as I remember 
 I've been walking through the wilderness 
 Praying to the Father 
 And waiting for my time 
 I've come here with a mission 
 And soon I'll give my life for this world 
 I'm praying in the garden 
 And I'm looking for a miracle 
 I find the journey hard but 
 It's the reason I was born 
 Can this cup be passed on 
 Lord, I pray your will be done 
 In this world 
 So I'll carry my cross 
 And I'll carry the shame 
 To the end of the road 
 Through the struggle and pain 
 And I'll do it for love 
 No, it won't be in vain 
 Yes, I'll carry my cross 
 And I'll carry the shame 
 I feel like I'm alone here 
 And I'm treated like a criminal 
 The time has come for me now 
 Even though I've done no wrong 
 Father, please forgive them 
 They know not what they've done 
 In this world 
 Three more days and I'll be coming back again 
 Three more days and I'll be coming back again

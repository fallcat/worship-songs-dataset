Take a good look around you 
 And I'm sure that you are bound to 
 Think that all you have comes down to 
 You and what you've done 
 If you look far beyond this 
 There's a life I hope you don't miss 
 What has kept you from moving on 
 Is learning to let go 
 And there's so much more 
 Than what you're looking for 
 Caught up in yourself 
 Call it like it is 
 Well you're so good 
 But you'll never be good enough 
 You think if you surrender 
 It's the end, but just remember 
 Life is more than dying embers 
 Burning in your soul 
 And I know it's true 
 'Cause I am just like you 
 You're caught up in yourself 
 Call it like it is 
 Well you're so good 
 But you'll never be good enough 
 Caught up in yourself 
 Call it like it is 
 Well you're so good 
 But you'll never be good enough 
 Thank God for mercy 
 Thank God for His grace 
 Thank God for everything you've got 
 Before it's too late, oh yeah 
 And there's so much more 
 Than what you're looking for 
 Caught up in yourself 
 Call it like it is 
 Well you're so good 
 But you'll never be good enough 
 You're caught up in yourself 
 Call it like it is 
 Well you're so good 
 But you'll never be good enough 
 Thank God for mercy 
 Thank God for His grace 
 Thank God for everything you've got 
 Before it's too late 
 Thank God for mercy 
 Thank God for His grace 
 Thank God for everything you've got 
 Before it's too late, 
 Before it's too late, oh yeah 
 You're caught up in yourself

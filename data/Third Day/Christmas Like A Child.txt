I want to feel Christmas, how it used to be 
 With all of its wonder falling on me 
 This season has felt so empty, oh for quite a while 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child 
 I want to see snowflakes fall to the ground 
 My brothers and sisters all gathered around 
 Singing "Away In A Manger" as we sit by the fire 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child 
 It's been so long now, I can't say 
 Just when I lost my way 
 But I'm going back to how it was (like a child) 
 When this day meant everything 
 And we spent our time remembering 
 the baby Child born for us 
 It's all about Jesus, asleep in the straw 
 This infant, this King, this Savior for all 
 So I don't need bells to be ringing 
 'Cause I'll join with angels singing 
 Gloria 
 And I can feel Christmas like a child 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child... 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child... 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child... 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child... 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child... 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child... 
 I want to feel Christmas like a child...

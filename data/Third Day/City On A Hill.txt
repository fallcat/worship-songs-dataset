You are the light of the world 
 A city on a hill cannot be hidden 
 Shine your light before all men 
 That they might see your works and then 
 Praise your Father up in Heaven 
 A city on a hill cannot be hidden 
 Standing tall before all men 
 To show the things that it's been given 
 And everything that it can give 
 Just like that city on a hillside 
 We got a light that's deep within us 
 No, don't keep it to yourself 
 Just remember how you felt 
 When you first gave your life to Jesus 
 And I now that our salvation isn't based on the things we do 
 But it's only given by the grace of God 
 By the sacrifice of Jesus, and if we really did believe 
 We were born to share this message with someone

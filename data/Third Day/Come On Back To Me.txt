You've been hiding now for so long 
 Never understanding why 
 Running far away from the truth 
 And all along chasing after lies 
 I have loved you from the beginning 
 Long before you knew my name 
 Even though you've broken my heart 
 I'll love you just the same 
 I'll love you anyway 
 Never mind your worries 
 Never mind your fears 
 They can only take you far from me 
 When you feel there's nowhere 
 Left for you to turn 
 Well, I got all you want 
 And everything you need 
 Come on back to me 
 Come on back to me, yeah 
 Do you believe in second chances 
 Or in a love that never fades 
 Put your faith in what you can't see 
 Just put your hand in mine 
 And I'll show you the way 
 Never mind your worries 
 Never mind your fears 
 They can only take you far from me, yeah 
 When you feel there's nowhere 
 Left for you to turn 
 Well, I got all you want 
 And everything you need 
 Come on back to me 
 Come on back to me, oh 
 Come on back to me, yeah 
 Come on back to me 
 Never mind your worries 
 Never mind your fears 
 They can only take you far from me 
 Oh, when you feel there's nowhere 
 Left for you to turn 
 Well, I got all you want 
 And everything you need 
 Come on back to me 
 Come on back to me, yeah 
 Come on back to me 
 Come on back to me now 
 Oh yeah 
 Come on back, come on back, come on back to me 
 Come on back, come on back, come on back to me now 
 Come on back to me

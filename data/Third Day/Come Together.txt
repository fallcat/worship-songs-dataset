Come Together album version: 
 You can all call me crazy 
 For the things that I might say 
 You can laugh all you want to, yeah 
 I know there will come a day 
 When we all will come together 
 And learn to set aside our hate 
 If we could learn to love our neighbors, yeah 
 Just like we would love ourselves 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to brave the weather 
 Through all of the storms 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to learn to love 
 We've got to learn to love 
 You can call me a dreamer 
 But these dreams will come true 
 Yes, I am a firm believer, yeah 
 In the things that we can do 
 If we would all just come together 
 And let the Lord lead our way 
 There is nothing that we can't do 
 There is nothing we can't face 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to brave the weather 
 Through all of the storms 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to learn to love 
 And I know there will come a day 
 When the Lord will call His own away 
 To a place that He has made for all of us 
 But until the day of His return 
 There's a lesson that we've got to learn 
 We are brothers and we're sisters 
 We are one 
 Oh yeah 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to brave the weather 
 Through all of the storms 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to learn to love 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to brave the weather 
 Through all of the storms 
 We've got to come together 
 'Cause in the end we can make it- alright 
 We've got to learn to love 
 We've got to learn to love 
 You know we've got to learn 
 You know we've got to 
 You know we've got to learn to love 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Don't you know? 
 Oh, yeah 
 Don't you know? 
 We've got to learn to love

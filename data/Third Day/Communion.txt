This is the body 
 This is the blood 
 Broken and poured out 
 For all of us 
 In this communion 
 We share in His love 
 This is the body 
 This is the blood 
 I will remember everything, Lord 
 That You've done for me 
 I won't take for granted 
 The sacrifice that set me free 
 I hunger and thirst for Your love 
 Come fill me today 
 We hunger and thirst for Your love 
 And Your righteousness 
 We long for Your presence here, Lord 
 Be with us again

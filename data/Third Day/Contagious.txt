My spirit is feeling fine, 
 'Cause I've got Jesus here in my life. 
 Well look at me, I'm so excited, 
 I feel good and I just can't hide it. 
 The love of Jesus is inside of me. 
 I've got no regrets, hide no secrets, 
 By His blood we are made righteous. 
 Filled with Jesus, man I may just, 
 Tell you what's up I'm feeling contagious. 
 Now I think that it is time, 
 I told you what's on my mind. 
 I've got nothing left to hide, 
 With Jesus here in my life. 
 When I feel Him I say amen. 
 Thank you Jesus once again, 
 For saving me from a life of sin. 
 Feels like a fever burning deep inside my soul. 
 I got to tell someone, I got to let you know. 
 I got to let this fever burn throughout the world.

Spoken: 
 This song by the way the great, which parts 
 Oh yeah 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 I believe 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I believe in God the Father 
 Almighty Maker of Heaven and Maker of Earth 
 And in Jesus Christ His only begotten Son, our Lord 
 He was conceived by the Holy Spirit 
 Born of the virgin Mary 
 Suffered under Pontius Pilate 
 He was crucified and dead and buried 
 I believe what I believe is what makes me what I am 
 I did not make it, no it is making me 
 It is the very truth of God and not the invention of any man 
 I believe that He who suffered, was crucified, buried, and dead 
 He descended into hell and on the third day, He rose again 
 He ascended into Heaven where He sits at God's mighty right hand 
 I believe that He's returning 
 To judge the quick and the dead and the sons of man 
 And I believe what I believe is what makes me what I am 
 No, I did not make it, no it is making me 
 It is the very truth of God and not the invention of any man 
 I believe, I believe it, yeah 
 Oh 
 I said I believe it 
 Yes, I believe it 
 Oh, I believe it 
 I believe in God the Father 
 Almighty Maker of Heaven and Maker of Earth 
 And in Jesus Christ His only begotten Son, our Lord 
 I believe in the Holy Spirit 
 One Holy Church, the communion of Saints 
 The forgiveness of sin 
 I believe in the resurrection 
 I believe in a life that never ends 
 And I believe what I believe, yeah, is what makes me what I am 
 I did not make it, no it is making me 
 I did not make it, no it is making me 
 I did not make it, no it is making me 
 It is the very truth of God and not the invention of any man 
 I believe it, I believe it... 
 I believe it, I believe it... 
 Oh 
 I said I believe it. 
 Spoken: 
 One with me 
 Do you believe it? 
 Do you believe it? 
 Do you believe it? 
 Yes, we believe it, yeah

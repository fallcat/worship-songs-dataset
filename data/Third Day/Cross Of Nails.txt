One cold November 
 A war retook the night 
 A church is left to ruin 
 A town is left to die 
 The morning after 
 We start to build again 
 You can burn down a building 
 But you can't destroy a faith 
 Rise up and fly again 
 True love, it never fails 
 Rise up and fly again 
 We will not forget Your cross of nails 
 When the war was over 
 We traveled across for miles 
 To set a true example of love reconciled 
 No longer fighting 
 Forget about the blame 
 Let's put the past behind us 
 And hope for better days 
 Father, forgive us 
 We know not what we do 
 Father, forgive us 
 We want to live for You 
 The hatred that divides us all 
 And coveting what is not our own 
 And greed exploiting works of human hands 
 Our envy of our other man 
 Indifference to the suffering 
 The lust and pride and all our other sins 
 Forgive us, Lord 
 Won't You forgive us, Lord...

To everyone who's lost someone they love 
 Long before it was their time 
 You feel like the days you had were not enough 
 When you said goodbye 
 And to all of the people with burdens and pains 
 Keeping you back from your life 
 You believe that there's nothing and there is no one 
 Who can make it right 
 There is hope for the helpless 
 Rest for the weary 
 Love for the broken heart 
 There is grace and forgiveness 
 Mercy and healing 
 He'll meet you wherever you are 
 Cry out to Jesus, Cry out to Jesus 
 For the marriage that's struggling just to hang on 
 They lost all of their faith in love 
 And they've done all they can to make it right again 
 Still it's not enough, no 
 For the ones who can't break the addictions and chains 
 You try to give up but you come back again 
 Just remember that you're not alone in your shame 
 And your suffering, no 
 There is hope for the helpless 
 Rest for the weary 
 Love for the broken heart 
 There is grace and forgiveness 
 Mercy and healing 
 He'll meet you wherever you are 
 Cry out to Jesus, Cry out to Jesus 
 When you're lonely 
 And it feels like the whole world is falling on you 
 You just reach out, you just cry out to Jesus 
 Cry to Jesus 
 For the widow who struggles with being alone 
 Wiping the tears from her eyes 
 For the children around the world without a home 
 Say a prayer tonight 
 There is hope for the helpless 
 Rest for the weary 
 Love for the broken heart 
 There is grace and forgiveness 
 Mercy and healing 
 He'll meet you wherever you are 
 There is hope for the helpless 
 Rest for the weary 
 Love for the broken heart 
 There is grace and forgiveness 
 Mercy and healing 
 He'll meet you wherever you are 
 Cry out to Jesus, Cry out to Jesus 
 Oh, cry out to Jesus, Cry out to Jesus 
 Oh yeah 
 Amen - spoken

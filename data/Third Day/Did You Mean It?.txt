There was a time in your life 
 When you wanted the pain to leave 
 There were tears in your eyes 
 You were down on your knees 
 Asking forgiveness.  Said you'd do anything. 
 But, did ya mean it? 
 And then the pain went away 
 But did ya thank your lord 
 You went your own way kept sinnin' even more 
 You said that someday.  Said you'd do anything 
 But, did ya mean it? 
 Well I know you know the difference 
 Between a promise and a lie 
 And I know you know the difference 
 Between what is wrong and right 
 I know you said you gave it all to Jesus Christ 
 You said that someday.  Said you'd do anything 
 But, did ya mean it? 
 There was a time in your life 
 When you were so afraid 
 Nothing could go right 
 You got on your knees and prayed and asked forgiveness 
 You said that someday.  You would do anything. 
 But, did ya mean it? 
 Now the time has come to make your promise true 
 But you sit around after all He's done for you 
 You need forgiveness, You don't do anything 
 No, you didn't mean it 
 Well I know you know the difference 
 Between a promise and a lie 
 And I know you know the difference 
 Between what is wrong and right 
 I know you said you gave it all to Jesus Christ 
 You said that someday.  Said you'd do anything 
 But, did ya mean it? 
 Now the time has come to make your promise true 
 But you sit around after all he's done for you 
 You need forgiveness, You don't do anything 
 No, you didn't mean it 
 Well I know you know the difference 
 Between a promise and a lie 
 And I know you know the difference 
 Between what is wrong and right 
 I know you said you gave it all to Jesus Christ 
 You said that someday.  Said you'd do anything 
 But, did ya mean it? 
 Oh yeah 
 You said that someday.  Said you'd do anything, yeah

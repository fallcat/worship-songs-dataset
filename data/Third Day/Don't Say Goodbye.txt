Look outside, the autumn leaves are falling 
 Deep inside you hear the road is calling 
 And I know you want to walk away 
 And leave it all behind 
 You're running from nothing 
 Chasing lies can find you tired and jaded 
 And in your world the colors have all faded 
 If you think that you can find a place 
 To get away from the pain 
 You're looking for nothing 
 And I hate to see you leave without a fight 
 Time will open doors for you 
 Wishes spent make dreams come true 
 I promise I'll be there 
 Don't say goodbye 
 Take my hand, let's walk a while together 
 Holding hands won't make love last forever 
 But I know you probably need someone 
 To help you work it out 
 You've gotta do something

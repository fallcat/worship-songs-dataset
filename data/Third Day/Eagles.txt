My pain and problems keep me chained 
 And my troubled heart makes me weak 
 I'll wait for You to comfort me 
 And in You I know I'll find my strength 
 I will soar on the wings of eagles 
 I will learn to fly high above this world 
 And I will soar on the wings of eagles 
 I will learn to fly 
 I will learn to fly high above this world 
 I tremble with this heavy weight 
 And I'm buried underneath my grief 
 I'll run to You and not grow faint 
 And I'll lay my burdens at Your feet

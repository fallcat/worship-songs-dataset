Nothing can stop me 
 I am not gonna change my mind 
 No one can keep me from the road that I'm on this time 
 No matter what I'm going to do what it takes to make it 
 I didn't know what I was missing 'til I met You 
 I never even thought to listen 
 No, I never knew 
 And now You've given me a second chance and I'll take it 
 So here I am, Lord, I want to be where You are 
 I need You now, won't You show me the way 
 Everywhere You go, I wanna go 
 Will You take me with You 
 Everywhere You lead, I wanna be by Your side 
 Everyone You love, I wanna love 
 Just like You love me 
 Everywhere you go, I wanna go there with You 
 It doesn't matter how long this is gonna take me 
 I'm gonna keep on moving even if it breaks me 
 I'll never turn around 
 I have found where I am going 
 So here I am, Lord, I want to be where You are 
 I need You now, won't You show me the way 
 Everywhere You go, I wanna go 
 Will You take me with You 
 Everywhere You lead, I wanna be by Your side 
 Everyone You love, I wanna love 
 Just like You love me 
 Everywhere you go, I wanna go there 
 Go there 
 Everywhere You go, I wanna go 
 Will You take me with You 
 Everywhere You lead, I wanna be by Your side 
 Everyone You love, I wanna love 
 Just like You love me 
 Everywhere you go, I wanna go there 
 Go there 
 Everywhere You go, I wanna go 
 Will You take me with You 
 Everywhere You lead, I wanna be by Your side 
 Everyone You love, I wanna love 
 Just like You love me 
 Everywhere you go, I wanna go there with you, yeah 
 Everywhere You go, I wanna go there with you 
 Everywhere You go, I wanna go there with you 
 Oh yeah, I want to go 
 Will you take me with you, Lord? 
 Everywhere You go 
 Oh, everywhere You go 
 Yeah, yeah

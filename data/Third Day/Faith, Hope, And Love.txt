Some people say that there is a better way, 
 And I believe it. 
 Some people say that there is a better place, 
 I can't wait to see it. 
 Cause Jesus Christ is coming back, 
 To take us home. 
 We all will gather round, 
 And worship at his throne. 
 Until we all are there, 
 Right there in paradise, 
 Let's keep our mind on things from up above. 
 And even though we go through, 
 Troubles in this life, 
 I know we'd all be better if we all had 
 A little bit of faith, hope and love. 
 Some people say that this is the end of days, 
 And I believe it. 
 I'm not afraid; I'm going to a better place, 
 I can't wait to see it.

This feeling in my heart 
 Is tearing me apart 
 No matter what I do 
 I can't run away from You 
 You've given and I've taken 
 I'm asking once again 
 My life is falling to pieces 
 Living my own way 
 My world is spinning in circles 
 So today your will be done 
 I'm walking on the edge 
 And trying to forget 
 The promises I've made 
 And the sacrifice you paid 
 You've given and I've taken 
 But I'm asking once again

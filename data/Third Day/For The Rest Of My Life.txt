Staring at the edge of a canyon 
 It all feels so far away 
 Somewhere it all went wrong 
 The sun has come and gone 
 I'm left here standing in the rain 
 You rescued me from the darkness 
 I feel the warmth and the light 
 Somehow you're pulled me out of 
 A sea of pain and doubt 
 I'm never gonna go that way again 
 For the rest of my life 
 Will You be by my side? 
 I can't make it by myself 
 I want You and no one else 
 For the rest of my life 
 And when my memories have all faded 
 They all seem so far away 
 My one and only hope is 
 I'll still be holding you close 
 I'm never gonna ever walk away from you again

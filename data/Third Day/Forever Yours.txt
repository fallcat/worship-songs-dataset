Hello to you, my love 
 I hope that you're doing well 
 I miss you so much 
 How I wish that I were there 
 There is a reason for everything 
 And there is hope, so don't let go 
 There's something more 
 Remember always 
 I'll remain forever yours 
 Forever yours 
 Oh, memories will fade 
 But don't let your heart forget 
 You'll see me again 
 But that day is not here yet 
 Sometimes you can't remember 
 Sometimes you can't forget 
 Sometimes you gotta do what must be done 
 And I'll love you forever and so until the end 
 I'll keep on holding on 
 Will you keep on holding on 
 When it's time to leave this world 
 And reach the other side 
 I'll wait for you upon that distant shore 
 For I have made a promise 
 And I hope you won't forget 
 I will always remain forever yours 
 Somewhere far beyond this place 
 And in another time 
 I know we'll be together once again 
 For I have made a promise 
 And I hope you won't forget 
 I will always remain forever yours 
 Forever yours 
 I have made a promise 
 And I hope you won't forget 
 That I'll always remain forever yours 
 Forever yours

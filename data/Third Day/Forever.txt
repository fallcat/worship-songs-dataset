I see a hand reaching out to help me 
 But I don't understand all of Your ways 
 You are still the potter and I am just the clay 
 And though I know at times I am too proud 
 To reach for You, to help me out 
 And if I waited on myself to get it right 
 I would be waiting here forever, oh yeah, but 
 Your grace is never going to change 
 And Your faith always will remain 
 And Your love is the same yesterday, today, and forever 
 I see a world looking for an answer 
 But I don't know what for 
 When will we realize that we're sinners 
 In the hands of a loving God who came 
 And died and wants to set us free 
 Oh, how He longs to be with you and me 
 And if we waited on the truth to change 
 We would be waiting here forever, oh yeah, but 
 Your grace is never going to change 
 And Your faith always will remain 
 And Your love is the same yesterday, today, and forever 
 I see a hand reaching out to help me 
 But I don't understand all of Your ways 
 But You saved me, I thank You Jesus 'cause 
 Your grace is never going to change 
 And Your faith always will remain 
 And Your love is the same yesterday, today, and forever 
 Oh yeah, but 
 Your grace is never going to change 
 And Your faith always will remain 
 And Your love is the same yesterday, today, and forever 
 Oh yes, 
 And Your love is the same yesterday, today, and forever 
 Forever 
 Forever 
 Forever 
 Forever

 I'm just not much of a giggler, man

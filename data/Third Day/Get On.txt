So you think you had me 
 Had me in your sights 
 I've got news for you 
 I'm working over time 
 To get away from slander 
 To stay away from lies 
 I won't listen to you criticize 
 Get on, get on get away from me 
 If you're trying to bring me down 
 If you're trying to bring me down 
 Get on, get on get away from me 
 If you're trying to bring me down 
 If you're trying to bring me down 
 I've been doin' some thinking 
 And I think you're wrong 
 For trying to put down 
 What I've been working on 
 So if you want to break me 
 You better stay away 
 I won't listen, no 
 I won't listen to you today 
 Excuse me if I still question 
 Carefully all of your intentions 
 I've decided that I won't listen 
 Because your words only bring division

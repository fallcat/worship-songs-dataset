 Comfort and pain, blessings in hard times, yeah 
 Oh

 The words of life and of truth You hold 
 All I want is love

 Turn Your eyes upon Jesus 
 Look full in His wonderful face 
 And the things of Earth 
 Will grow strangely dim 
 In the light of His glory and grace 
 Sing turn your eyes upon Jesus, come on - spoken 
 Turn Your eyes upon Jesus 
 Look full in His wonderful face 
 And the things of Earth 
 Will grow strangely dim 
 In the light of His glory and His grace, oh yeah

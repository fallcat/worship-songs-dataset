Whisper softly to Me 
 Share with Me your heart 
 And just ignore the world and what it does 
 I know that you've been hurting, you've been torn apart 
 And I pull you close and hold you in My arms 
 If you give love 
 I'll return the love and you will see 
 So much more than you gave away 
 If you give love 
 Give it to Me 
 Listen very closely as I sing this song 
 And please believe that I mean every word 
 When I say I love you 
 I mean it with all My heart 
 Let it be the best thing that you've ever heard 
 If you give love 
 I'll return the love and you will see 
 So much more than you gave away 
 If you give love 
 Give it to Me 
 Oh, give it to Me 
 Oh 
 Whisper softly to Me 
 Share with Me your heart 
 If you give love 
 I'll return the love and you will see 
 So much more than you gave away 
 If you give love 
 If you give love 
 I'll return the love and you will see 
 So much more than you gave away 
 If you give love 
 Give it to Me 
 Give it to Me 
 Oh 
 Give it to Me 
 Give it to Me 
 Oh 
 Give it to Me

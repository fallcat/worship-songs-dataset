There must be something wrong with me 
 I won't stop taking chances 
 It's nothing to do with apathy 
 I can't take no for an answer 
 Give me a reason 
 Why do I do it? 
 Would you believe it 
 If I told you a lie? 
 Give me a reason 
 How could I do it? 
 The truth isn't easy 
 That much I can't deny 
 The question still remains the same 
 On who can I place all the blame? 
 The demons, devils of the world 
 Or is it only myself? 
 Give me a reason 
 Why do I do it? 
 Would you believe it 
 If I told you a lie? 
 Give me a reason 
 How could I do it? 
 The truth isn't easy 
 That much I can't deny 
 There is something definitely wrong 
 With all of us 
 It would take a miracle of God 
 To make things right 
 There is something wrong here 
 With all of us 
 The answer lies in front of me 
 Confirmed by God's own Spirit 
 It's in the pages that I read 
 How could I ever deny it? 
 Give me a reason 
 Why do I do it? 
 Would you believe it 
 If I told you a lie? 
 Give me a reason 
 How could I do it? 
 The truth isn't easy 
 That much I can't deny

You said all that follow you may find 
 Comfort and pain, blessings in hard times 
 Were I to leave, where else would I go? 
 The words of life and of truth you hold 
 All I want is love 
 I confess to this 
 I will take it, Lord 
 All you have to give 
 How great the love lavished on us all 
 That we can be the children of God

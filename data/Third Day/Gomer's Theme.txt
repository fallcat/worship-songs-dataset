In this place Saw her face 
 He was more than happier 
 Made for him It's a sin 
 That she was not faithful 
 She couldn't be Foolishly 
 More unfaithful if she tried 
 He did not care 
 Wanted her despite lies 
 And wandering eyes 
 He deserves the very best 
 But he loves her none the less 
 She's forgotten her first love (Maybe one day she'll return) 
 He's forgotten that she ever 
 Went away and broke His heart 
 Lavished on Silver, gold, anything she needed 
 Wasted thoughts 
 Broken hearts love was not acknowledged 
 He deserves the very best 
 But he loves her none the less 
 She's forgotten her first love (Maybe one day she'll return) 
 He's forgotten that she ever 
 Went away and broke His heart 
 God only knows 
 That He has shown her 
 More love that she deserves 
 There will come a time 
 When she will find 
 That He's not there 
 To give her love 
 And He'll be gone away 
 From her forever 
 She's forgotten her first love (Maybe one day she'll return) 
 He's forgotten that she ever 
 Went away and broke His heart 
 She's forgotten her first love (Maybe one day she'll return) 
 He's forgotten that she ever 
 Went away and broke His heart 
 Hosea 1 - 3

Please forgive me 
 I don't mean to be rude 
 But I gotten keep moving 
 I sure wish I could stay 
 But I gotta keep doing 
 What I've been called to do 
 And don't forget me 
 Long after I'm gone 
 And I'm just a memory 
 I hope you can recall 
 What I was saying 
 Was nothing but the truth 
 Well, I'm gone 
 It was nice to meet you 
 But I'm gone 
 I'm sure gonna miss you 
 But I've got to keep moving on 
 I can't stay in one place too long 
 Say a prayer for me 
 I'm gone 
 Thank you so much 
 You've been so kind 
 And I can't say enough 
 Of all the places I've been 
 This is one 
 That I just don't want to leave 
 But, I'm gone 
 It was nice to meet you 
 But I'm gone 
 I'm sure gonna miss you 
 But I've got to keep moving on 
 I can't stay in one place too long 
 Say a prayer for me 
 I'm gone 
 Gone like the wind and I'm not sure 
 When I'm coming back, will you want more 
 God only knows where I am going 
 And just what tomorrow brings 
 Well, I'm gone 
 It was nice to meet you 
 But I'm gone 
 I'm sure gonna miss you 
 Well, I'm gone 
 It was nice to meet you 
 But I'm gone 
 I'm sure gonna miss you 
 But I've got to keep moving on 
 I can't stay in one place too long 
 Say a prayer for me 
 I'm gone 
 Say a prayer for me 
 Say a prayer for me 
 I'm gone 
 Say a prayer for me 
 Say a prayer for me 
 I'm gone, yeah

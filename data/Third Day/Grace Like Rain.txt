Amazing grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 And I once was lost but now I'm found 
 Was blind but now I see so clearly 
 Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me 
 Hallelujah, and all my stains are washed away 
 They're washed away 
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fears relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear 
 The hour I first believed 
 And hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me 
 And hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, they're washed away 
 When we've been there ten thousand years 
 Bright shining as the sun 
 We've no less days to sing Your praise 
 Than when we first begun 
 And hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me 
 And hallelujah, all my stains are washed away 
 And hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me 
 And hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, they're washed away 
 And hallelujah 
 And hallelujah 
 And hallelujah 
 And hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, they're washed away

My will won't break, it barely bends 
 Same old sinner, the same old sin 
 On my knees to plead again 
 Confession trial, where to begin? 
 Have mercy, on me a sinning man 
 Lord have mercy, on me a sinning man 
 If it's true that the wages of sin is death 
 Then I've earned quite enough to quit 
 The reward I deserve I'd surely get 
 Were it not for you to pay my debt 
 Have mercy, on me a sinning man 
 Lord have mercy, on me a sinning man 
 Oh, I don't think I can take this further 
 Oh, if it's not one thing it's another 
 My will won't break, it barely bends 
 Same old sinner, the same old sin 
 On my knees to plead again 
 Confession trial, where to begin? 
 Have mercy, on me a sinning man 
 Lord have mercy, on me a sinning man 
 Oh, I don't think I can take this further 
 Oh, if it's not one thing it's another

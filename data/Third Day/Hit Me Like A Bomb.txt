You hit me like a bomb 
 And everything I'm used to 
 Is suddenly gone 
 Sorry to accuse you 
 Do you know what you've done 
 When you hit me like a bomb 
 Hear the sound of the sirens ringing 
 See the world of a life that's changing 
 Well you hit me like a bomb 
 I was scared and I started running 
 Can't say I never saw it coming 
 When you hit me like a bomb 
 (La la la la la la la la...) 
 You hit me like a bomb 
 Everything's changing 
 It didn't take long 
 For you to start rearranging 
 Everything that I've known 
 When you hit me like a bomb 
 Hear the sound of the sirens ringing 
 See the world of a life that's changing 
 Well you hit me like a bomb 
 I was scared and I started running 
 Can't say I never saw it coming 
 When you hit me like a bomb 
 (La la la la la la la la...) 
 You hit me like a bomb and I saw it coming 
 Hit me like a bomb and it's all my fault 
 You hit me like a bomb and I saw it coming 
 Hit me like a bomb and it's all my fault 
 Hear the sound of the sirens ringing 
 See the world of a life that's changing 
 Well you hit me like a bomb 
 I was scared and I started running 
 Can't say I never saw it coming 
 When you hit me like a bomb 
 (La la la la la la la la...)

I've got my doubts and I've got my questions 
 It's nothing new 'cause I've seen them before 
 I've had my share of false revelations 
 It always seems they're knockin' on my door 
 You said that I should see the light 
 But sometimes faith is blind 
 How do you know, how do you know 
 What I'm suppose to be doing 
 Why do you go, why do you go on 
 Thinking you know my fate 
 So many times I've lost my step 
 But never lost my way 
 How do you know, how do you know 
 When I don't know myself 
 You're thinking that you've got all the answers 
 You've got my situation figured out 
 But you're only seeing part of the picture 
 There's so much more that you don't know about 
 And here you come to speak your mind 
 But I'll say one more time

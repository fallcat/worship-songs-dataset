How's your head? I'm so sorry 
 That I can't do anything about it 
 Like I said, I'll be praying 
 Here without you I feel helpless 
 Sorry I had to go away 
 Tomorrow's just another day 
 Without you here, I'll have to say 
 Hold on to love 
 How's your day? Do you miss me? 
 Right now I've only a minute 
 Called to say, I'm so sorry 
 And once again I feel helpless 
 God forbid we'd be apart 
 How close or shall I ask how far 
 Are we until the demise of this helplessness

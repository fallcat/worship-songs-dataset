Spoken: 
 There's no doubt in my mind that with a crowd so large, 
 That there are many different people who have come here for many different reasons. 
 There are some people here tonight, you're here because somebody dragged you along, and you had no idea of what you were getting into. 
 We're glad you're here, and we hope you have a good time. 
 Spoken: 
 Some people here tonight, that are here because they love Christian music, and you came to hear some Christian bands play some good Christian music tonight. 
 There are people here tonight because they simply love to gather together with your brothers and sisters in the faith, in a time of celebration together. 
 Many of us are here tonight because we truly, genuinely, want to feel God's presence in this place. 
 Spoken: 
 So, Lord, we pray tonight, You'd send Your Holy Spirit to fall upon us. 
 Lord, bring about freedom, bring about healing tonight, Lord Jesus. 
 Lord, speak to our hearts tonight, and be glorified. 
 It's in Your name we pray and ask these things. 
 I seek the silence through the chaos and the noise 
 That's when I'm listening; oh I want to hear Your voice 
 Sometimes it softly speaks, a whisper on the wind 
 Sometimes it's louder when Your Spirit rushes in 
 And I can feel, yeah, it all around me 
 I can feel, yeah, it all around me now

 I keep on searching for Your presence in this place 
 I see your hand at work, I feel Your touch of grace 
 Sometimes it falls like rain upon this thirsty land 
 Sometimes You gently stir the heart of every man 
 And I can feel, yeah, it all around me 
 You sing it - spoken 
 I can feel, yeah, it all around me 
 I can feel it 
 I can feel it 
 I can feel Your heartbeat, Lord 
 I can feel it 
 I can feel it 
 I can feel Your heartbeat 
 I pray You'd send Your presence down, 
 Send it down 
 Fill us with Your Spirit now 
 Everybody sing, I can feel. Here we go - spoken 
 I can 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It all around me 
 And I can feel, yeah, it all around me now 
 I can feel it 
 I can feel it 
 I can feel Your heartbeat 
 I can feel it 
 I can feel it, Lord 
 I can feel Your heartbeat right now

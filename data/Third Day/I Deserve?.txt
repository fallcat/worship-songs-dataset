I tasted fruit that was forbidden 
 I murdered trust that you had given 
 And now I'm living in a place that's not my home 
 The pain in your heart made you regret 
 The moment we spoke, did you forget? 
 Will my transgressions bring us all to our sweet end? 
 Maybe I'm just being too hard on myself. I don't know 
 Or is it that your mercy is much more than I deserve? 
 Betrayed by more than just a kiss 
 I did much more I must admit 
 Instead of letting it all end you bring new hope

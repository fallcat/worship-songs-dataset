Cannot find the words to say I'm sorry 
 Don't know how to show You I was wrong 
 Wasted all that You had given me 
 Now I'm left with nothing and no one 
 And I find it's my fault 
 I'm the only one to blame 
 For the tears and the pain 
 I don't know what I can say 
 Or would it matter anyway 
 'Cause I don't know how you could still forgive me 
 For all that I have put You through 
 Is there anything that I can do 
 I would give my life to find Your mercy 
 I don't know 
 All my life has lead to this decision 
 To return and ask You this one thing 
 And if I had one chance or if a million 
 Would it ever be enough for me 
 To explain what I've done 
 Now I know that I was wrong 
 Will you hold me again 
 I don't know what I can say 
 Or would it matter anyway 
 'Cause I don't know how You can still forgive me 
 For all that I have out You through 
 Is there anything I can do 
 I would give my life to find Your mercy 
 What will it take until You forgive me 
 I don't know 
 And I find it's my fault 
 I'm the only one to blame 
 For the tears and the pain 
 I don't know what I can say 
 Or would it matter anyway 
 'Cause I don't know how You could still forgive me 
 For all that I have put You through 
 Is there anything that I can do 
 I would give my life to find your mercy 
 I don't know what I can say 
 Or would it matter anyway 
 'Cause I don't know how You could still forgive me 
 For all that I have out You through 
 Is there anything I can do 
 I would give my life to find Your mercy 
 What will it take until You forgive me 
 Or Lord will I find that You have already 
 I don't know

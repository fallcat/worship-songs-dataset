I got a message 
 I got a song 
 Can I get a witness? 
 Tell me what's going on 
 I'll show the people 
 A better way 
 Maybe I will tomorrow 
 Maybe I will today 
 'Cause I got a feeling it won't be long 
 Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong 
 But I know one thing for sure 
 Only time will tell it 
 I got a feeling coming over me 
 Nothing else here can set me free 
 But I know one thing for sure 
 Well, I've got to show it 
 I got a mission 
 I got a sign 
 Is anybody listening? 
 I gotta make sure this time 
 I'll tell the people 
 What's on my mind 
 Maybe I will tomorrow 
 Maybe I will tonight 
 'Cause I got a feeling it won't be long 
 Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong 
 But I know one thing for sure 
 Only time will tell it 
 I got a feeling coming over me 
 Nothing else here can set me free 
 But I know one thing for sure 
 Well, I've got to show it 
 Oh, I got a feeling 
 Oh, I got a feeling 
 Oh, I got a feeling 
 I got a message 
 I got a song 
 Everybody help me sing along 
 I got a message 
 I got a song 
 Everybody help me sing along 
 I got a message 
 I got a song 
 Everybody help me sing along 
 I got a message 
 I got a song 
 Everybody help me sing along 
 I got a feeling it won't be long 
 Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong 
 But I know one thing for sure 
 Only time will tell it 
 I got a feeling coming over me 
 Nothing else here can set me free 
 But I know one thing for sure 
 Well, I've got to show it 
 'Cause I got a feeling 
 Oh, I got a feeling 
 Oh, I got a feeling 
 Oh, I got a feeling 
 Oh it won't be long...

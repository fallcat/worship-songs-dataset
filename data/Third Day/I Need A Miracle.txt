Well, late one night, she started to cry and thought he ain't coming home 
 She was tired of the lies, tired of the fight, but she didn't want to see him go 
 She fell on her knees and said, "I haven't prayed since I was young 
 But Lord above I need a miracle" 
 Well no matter who you are and no matter what you've done 
 There will come a time when you can't make it on your own 
 And in your hour of desperation 
 Know you're not the only one, praying 
 Lord above, I need a miracle 
 I need a miracle 
 He lost his job and all he had in the fall of '09 
 Now he feared the worst, that he would lose his children and his wife 
 So he drove down deep into the woods and thought he'd end it all 
 And prayed, "Lord above, I need a miracle" 
 Well no matter who you are and no matter what you've done 
 There will come a time when you can't make it on your own 
 And in your hour of desperation 
 Know you're not the only one, praying 
 Lord above, I need a miracle 
 I need a miracle 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 Whoa oh 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 Whoa oh 
 He turned on the radio to hear a song for the last time 
 He didn't know what he was looking for even what he'd find 
 The song he heard gave him hope and strength to carry on 
 And on that night, they found a miracle 
 They found a miracle 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 Whoa oh 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 Whoa oh 
 In your hour of desperation 
 Know you're not the only one, praying 
 Lord above, I need a miracle 
 I need a miracle 
 Tired of the fight

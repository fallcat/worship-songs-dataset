Some see a teacher 
 Standing on a hill 
 Speaking words of wisdom 
 Some see a healer 
 Reaching out his hand 
 To give sight to a blind man 
 Some see a dreamer 
 Wasting his life 
 On what can never be 
 Some see a fool 
 Dying for his dreams 
 But I see love (I see love) 
 I see love (I see love) 
 Light of heaven breaking through 
 Well I see grace (I see grace) 
 I see God's face (I see God's face) 
 Shining pure and perfect love 
 When I see You 
 I see love 
 Some see a prisoner 
 Alone before his judge 
 With no one to defend him 
 Some see a victim 
 Beaten and abused 
 With all the world against him 
 Some see a martyr 
 Carrying his cross 
 For what he believes 
 Some see a hero 
 Who set his people free 
 But I see love (I see love) 
 I see love (I see love) 
 Light of heaven breaking through 
 Well I see grace (I see grace) 
 I see God's face (I see God's face) 
 Shining pure and perfect love 
 When I see You 
 With your last breath 
 I see love 
 Through Your death 
 I see love 
 I see peace in the eyes of the king 
 I see hope in Your suffering (I see love) 
 I see a calm in the center of the storm 
 I see a Saviour 
 I see love 
 I see love 
 Light of heaven breaking through (heaven breaking through) 
 I see grace 
 I see God's face 
 Shining pure and perfect love 
 When I see You 
 I see love 
 When I see You 
 I see heaven's breaking through 
 See God's face 
 Shining pure and perfect love 
 When I see You 
 When I see You 
 When I see You 
 I see love 
 I see love 
 When I see 
 Some see Him walking from an empty grave

Time has kept me waiting 
 Anticipating for something more 
 And life has kept me looking 
 But I'm not certain what I'm searching for 
 Faith is like the sunlight in my eyes 
 In my eyes 
 It can light the way 
 But then sometimes 
 It is so blinding 
 Heaven, let your light shine down on me 
 Open up my eyes so I can see 
 Give me some faith so I believe in something 
 Heaven, let your light shine down on me 
 Open up my eyes so I can see 
 Give me some faith so I believe in something 
 Hope is sometimes fading 
 But there'll be a day when it fades no more 
 Love, it lasts forever 
 Maybe that's what we're all looking for 
 Faith, just like the sunshine in my eyes 
 It burns so bright 
 It can light the way 
 But then sometimes 
 It is so blinding 
 I want to believe in something 
 I want to believe in you 
 I want to believe in something 
 I want to believe in you 
 I want to believe in faith and hope and life and dreams 
 Grace and love and all those things 
 Most of all, I want to believe in you 
 I want to believe in peace and freedom for all men 
 Redemption and a second chance 
 Most of all, I want to believe in you 
 I want to believe in you

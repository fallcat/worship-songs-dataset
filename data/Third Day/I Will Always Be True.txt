I will always be true 
 No, I'll never be leaving 
 I will be here with you 
 Through the storms and the seasons 
 Through the sun and the rain 
 Through the joy and the pain 
 I will know what to do 
 I will always be true 
 I will always be true 
 No, you never should doubt it 
 Once again I will prove 
 There is no way around it 
 Through the questions and tears 
 Every day of the year 
 I will know what to do 
 I will always be true 
 If you need a shoulder to cry on 
 I'm here every time 
 And when you need a hand to hold 
 I'll give you mine, oh 
 I'll give you mine 
 I will always be true 
 You can always believe it 
 And when my life is through 
 Well I hope you will see that 
 Every day that I live 
 Every breath that I breathe 
 Yes, it all was for you 
 I will always be true 
 And if you need a shoulder to cry on 
 I'm here every time 
 And when you need a hand to hold 
 I'll give you mine, oh 
 If you need a shoulder to cry on 
 I'm here every time 
 And when you need a hand to hold 
 I'll give you mine, oh 
 Yeah, I'll give you mine 
 I will always be true 
 I will always be true, yeah 
 All for you

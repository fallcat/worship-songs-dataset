Sometimes the night starts closing in 
 And I've lost my way home again 
 I'm running out of places I can turn 
 Enemies on every side 
 Not a friend around for miles 
 That's the time it really starts to hurt 
 Beat me up and drag me down 
 I'll never be afraid 
 I will hold my head high 
 Lift my hands to the sky 
 Rise above all who try to bring me down 
 I will hold my head high 
 I know you said it'd be okay 
 Sometimes I question just the same 
 I wonder if my problems are too small 
 Then I look back and realize 
 All your pain and sacrifice 
 Ooh, and how you suffered for us all 
 Pre-chorus/chorus 
 Beat me up and drag me down 
 And lock me in or keep out 
 Whatever they may throw at me 
 I'll turn in to a song for you

When you're down and you're falling fast 
 And you feel like your hope won't last 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 When you find that your faith is gone 
 You're not sure if you can carry on 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 You've been through more than anyone should 
 Can you find the good in such a bad situation 
 You never thought this could happen to you 
 Now you know the truth 
 You feel like your life is fading 
 I hope you can remember 
 When you're down and you're falling fast 
 And you feel like your hope won't last 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 When you find that your faith is gone 
 You're not sure if you can carry on 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 The life you had is going to change 
 But please don't be afraid 
 It might be for the better 
 When you're down and you're falling fast 
 And you feel like your hope won't last 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 When you find that your faith is gone 
 You're not sure if you can carry on 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 Well, I'll be the one that's standing next to you 
 I'll be the one that's gonna help make it through 
 When everybody else has gone 
 I'll be the one that's holding you 
 Oh… 
 When you're down and you're falling fast 
 And you feel like your hope won't last 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 When you find that your faith is gone 
 You're not sure if you can carry on 
 You know that I'll be your miracle 
 I'll be your miracle 
 Oh…. 
 I'll be your miracle 
 I'll be your miracle 
 Oh….. 
 I'll be your miracle 
 Oh….. 
 I'll be your miracle

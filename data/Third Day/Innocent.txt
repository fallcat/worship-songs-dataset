It seemed like I had run out of second chances 
 And they sentenced me to die 
 And I was just like a dead man walking 
 I was running out of time 
 But you came to me and opened my eyes 
 You gave me a brand new life 
 I am innocent and I have been set free 
 I no longer have chains around my feet 
 And no matter where I go or what they say 
 I am innocent 
 Many years have past since the day that I met you 
 But your words are still the same 
 And every time I find myself with joy or sadness 
 I am calling out your name 
 'Cause you came to me and opened my eyes 
 You gave to me a brand new life

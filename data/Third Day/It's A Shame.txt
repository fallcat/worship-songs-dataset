I hate to be the one 
 Who's given up 
 And feels that all our hope is gone 
 But what I thought was a miracle 
 Just turned into the same old 
 Problem that it was 
 She longs for better days 
 She's always been afraid 
 It's a shame, oh it's a shame 
 That you are throwing your whole life away 
 It's a shame, oh it's a shame 
 I wonder if you're ever going to change 
 It's a shame 
 Ever since I can recall 
 She has been so afraid 
 Of you losing it all 
 What do you want? 
 Do you even know? 
 And is it worth the pain? 
 We all have to endure 
 She longs for better days 
 She's always been afraid 
 You left her without leaving 
 You hit her without swinging 
 You took away without giving a thing 
 Except for pain and sorrow 
 I'm praying that tomorrow 
 You will open up your eyes and see

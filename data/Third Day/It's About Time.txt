Well I need to be more than I have been 
 Well I need to be more than I have been 
 Not for myslef, but for all men 
 Well I need to be more than I have been, and 
 I need to do more than I have done, and 
 I need to do more than I have done 
 Not for myslef, for everyone 
 I need to do more than I have done, and 
 It's about time, 
 That I try to live my life 
 For more than myself 
 It's about time, 
 That I try to live my life 
 For Jesus and walk in his steps 
 For too long I've been, such a selfish man 
 Leading my whole life, just for myself. 
 Now I've been given, a second chance, and 
 I'm not going to let it slip away. 
 I need to love more than I have loved, and 
 I need to love more than I have loved 
 Miss you I never, given up, and 
 I need to love more than I have loved

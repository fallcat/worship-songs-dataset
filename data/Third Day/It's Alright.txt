Your letter said that you were leaving 
 But you didn't know how long 
 I have never stopped believing 
 That one day you would return 
 And though waiting is the hardest 
 Part of everything I do 
 I do confess it's getting better 
 Knowing I will be with you 
 It's all right 
 It's okay 
 I won't worry about tomorrow 
 For it brings me one more day 
 Closer than I was to you 
 Now the question isn't "will you" 
 What I want to know is "when" 
 If it's one day or a million 
 I will wait for you till till then 
 So I'm holding on to your words 
 And the promises you've made 
 There is not one you have broken 
 There's not one I didn't take 
 Your letter said that you were leaving 
 But you didn't know how long 
 I will never stop believing 
 I know one day you will return

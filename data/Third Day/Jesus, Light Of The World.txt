The most beautiful night of the year 
 All the stars light up the sky 
 And the city is sparkling with silver and gold 
 From a million points of light 
 A reflection of something that's deeper within 
 Just a flicker of something more 
 Jesus, light of the world 
 Shine through the darkness, bright as the day 
 Jesus, light of the world 
 Shine in our hearts and show us the way tonight 
 Who is this Child in the manger? 
 Kings bow down and angels sing 
 The Lord of the universe has come here to save us 
 A precious offering 
 All the heavens above and the earth below 
 Are filled with the light of Your love 
 Jesus, light of the world 
 Shine through the darkness, bright as the day 
 Jesus, light of the world 
 Shine in our hearts and show us the way tonight, yeah 
 Jesus, light of the world 
 Shine through the darkness, bright as the day 
 Jesus, light of the world 
 Shine in our hearts and show us the way 
 Jesus, shine 
 Shine 
 Show us the way 
 Shine in our hearts and show us the way tonight 
 Oh 
 Show us the way tonight

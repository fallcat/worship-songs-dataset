It feels like forever since I can remember 
 It seems like it's always been this way 
 Keep the good news to ourselves, like a secret we'll never tell 
 I don't know why we've been so ashamed 
 But changes are in the air, sparks are starting everywhere 
 And oh, what a sweet, sweet sound 
 With millions of voices, singing new choruses 
 Leading the way to higher ground 
 Keep on, keep on shinin' 
 Wherever you may be 
 Keep on, keep on shinin' 
 For all the world to see 
 Having faith in the long run is easier said than done 
 It's hard to live out in the light of day 
 You're bruised and you're battered, your dreams have been shattered 
 Your best laid plans scattered over the place 
 Despite all your tendencies, God sees it differently 
 Your struggle's a time to grow 
 And you, you're a miracle, anything but typical 
 It's time for the whole wide world to know

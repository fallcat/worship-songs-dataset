What if I told you that I love you 
 What if I showed you just how much 
 I would do anything to hold you 
 Give everything to prove my love 
 Yeah, yeah, no one can keep me from your side 
 Yeah, yeah, but if they ever even try 
 They'd have to drag me away kicking and screaming 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 They'd have to drag me away kicking and screaming 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 And if you said you didn't want me 
 Kept me away, said we were through 
 You don't know just how ready and willing 
 To do everything that I can to convince you 
 Yeah, yeah, no one can keep me from your side 
 Yeah, yeah, but if they ever even try 
 They'd have to drag me away kicking and screaming 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 They'd have to drag me away kicking and screaming 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 I'd go anywhere 
 As long as you are there 
 You know I'd do anything 
 As long as you're with me 
 I would fight for you 
 If you want me too 
 I will not lie to you 
 Give my life for you 
 They'd have to drag me away kicking and screaming 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 They'd have to drag me away kicking and screaming 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

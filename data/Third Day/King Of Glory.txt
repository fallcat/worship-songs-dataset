Who is this King of glory that pursues me with His love 
 And haunts me with each hearing of His softly spoken words 
 My conscious, a reminder of forgiveness that I need 
 Who is this King of glory who offers it to me 
 Who is this King of angels, O blessed Prince of Peace 
 Revealing things of Heaven and all its mysteries 
 My spirit's ever longing for His grace in which to stand

 His name is Jesus, precious Jesus 
 The Lord Almighty, the King of my heart 
 The King of glory 
 Who is this King of glory with strength and majesty 
 And wisdom beyond measure, the gracious King of kings

Ever since the world around you shattered 
 You've been looking everywhere for something more 
 Sometimes you feel like your life doesn't matter 
 But it does 
 I tell you it does, oh yeah 
 Come on let Me love you now 
 Come on let Me love you 
 And hold you through the storms 
 I will keep you safe and warm 
 Come on let Me love you now 
 Come on let Me love you and kiss away your tears 
 I will always be here 
 Come on let Me love you 
 Yesterday you found your heart was broken 
 Tomorrow doesn't leave much room for hope 
 Today you'll find that My arms are wide open 
 And My heart 
 My heart is full of love, oh yeah 
 Come on let Me love you now 
 Come on let Me love you 
 And hold you through the storms 
 I will keep you safe and warm 
 Come on let Me love you now 
 Come on let Me love you and kiss away your tears 
 I will always be here 
 Give up on all the other things 
 'Cause My love can bring you more 
 And if you take a chance on Me 
 I'll give you what you're looking for 
 Come on let Me love you now 
 Come on let Me love you 
 And hold you through the storms 
 I will keep you safe and warm 
 Come on let Me love you now 
 Come on let Me love you and kiss away your tears 
 I will always be here 
 Come on let Me love you, oh 
 Come on let Me love you 
 Oh, Come on let Me love you, yeah 
 Come on let Me love you

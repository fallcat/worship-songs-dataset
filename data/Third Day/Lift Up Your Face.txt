Lift up your face 
 Lift up your face 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling 
 You have fallen so far now 
 You don't even know how 
 You are going to survive 
 But just over the horizon 
 A new light is shining 
 Breaking through the darkest night 
 Love is coming and it's calling out your name 
 Lift up your face 
 Lift up your face 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling 
 Lift up your face 
 Lift up your face 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling (your name) 
 You feel like your life is fading 
 You're tired of waiting 
 For your moment to arrive 
 But tomorrow will bring 
 A song that you can sing 
 And your hope is gonna rise 
 Love is coming and it's calling out your name 
 Lift up your face 
 Lift up your face 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling 
 Lift up your face 
 Lift up your face 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling (your name) 
 Calling your name 
 Oh, yeah, yeah 
 Do you hear Him calling 
 Can you hear Him calling 
 He's calling out your name 
 He's calling out your name 
 Lift up your face 
 Lift up your face 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling 
 Lift up your face 
 Lift up your face 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling (your name) 
 Lift up your face 
 Can you hear Him calling 
 Lift up your face 
 Can you hear Him calling now 
 Salvation is calling 
 Salvation is calling (your name) 
 Can you hear Him calling You 
 He's calling You now 
 He's calling out your name 
 Just over the horizon 
 A new light is shining 
 Salvation is on its way

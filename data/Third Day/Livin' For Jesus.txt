Sometimes things don't work out quite the way 
 That you wanted them to 
 Sometimes people don't do all the things 
 That you wanted them to, yeah 
 There are times when 
 The answers aren't easy to see 
 Sometimes we're on a road 
 Going back to a place we never wanted to be 
 Well that's all right 
 I'm just fine.  Done made up my mind 
 That I'm livin for Jesus 
 When I'm alone and feeling down 
 Now, down so deep in my heart 
 I turn to Jesus and ask Him 
 For a brand new start 
 He's the reason for my life 
 Being something better and new 
 And now I've finally found a love 
 That is proven tried and true 
 Well that's all right 
 I'm just fine.  Done made up my mind 
 That I'm livin for Jesus 
 I tell you I'm all right 
 I'm just fine.  Done made up my mind 
 That I'm livin for Jesus 
 I'm all right 
 I'm just fine.  Done made up my mind 
 That I'm livin for Jesus 
 I tell you I'm all right 
 I'm just fine.  Done made up my mind 
 That I'm livin for Jesus 
 I'm livin for Jesus, yeah, yeah 
 Yes, I'm livin for Jesus

Well I've been taking 
 It all for granted 
 Everything that I, have been giving 
 Now it is the day, to start my mission 
 It's been a long time a coming 
 There are many, searching for answers 
 Tell me who am I, to keep it to myself? 
 I've grown weary of my own fears 
 It's been a long time a coming 
 Well I've been running just like an outlaw 
 And I am willing and I am able 
 To give you something that you can believe on 
 It's been a long time a coming 
 True believers, 
 Have been staring, up into the sky 
 Waiting for your return 
 And I know one day 
 The clouds will roll down 
 It's been a long time coming

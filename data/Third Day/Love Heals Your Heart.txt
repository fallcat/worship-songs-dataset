Did you think you were immune to this 
 Did you think you could escape without infection 
 You do all you're able to resist 
 Just to avoid the danger of rejection 
 Memory warns you of the past 
 When it all went wrong 
 When you think your life is shattered 
 And there's no way to be fixed again 
 Love heals your heart 
 At a time you least expected 
 You're alive like you have never been 
 Love heals your heart 
 Everybody has a wall to climb 
 That was built to guard the pain that holds them captive 
 Every smile that they would hide behind 
 Will try to mask the hurt beneath the surface 
 Sometimes it's hard to understand 
 How we're trapped inside

Spoken: 
 Oh, has anyone had a good time tonight? 
 (Screaming from audience) 
 Amen.  Amen. 
 We've had a good time tonight.  I'm tired there.  I'm tired. 
 I can't go home.  I can't go home. 
 Mark, can you go home? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, let's do this. 
 I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain 
 Just to be with the one he loves 
 How many times has he broken that promise 
 It has never been done 
 Well, I've never climbed the highest mountain 
 But I walked the hill of Calvary 
 Just to be with you, well I'd do anything 
 Well, there's no price I would not pay, no 
 And just to be with you, I'd give anything 
 Oh yes, I would give my life away 
 Yes 
 And I've heard it said that a man would swim the oceans 
 Just to be with the one he loves 
 But all of those dreams are in empty motion 
 It can never be done 
 Well, I've never swam the deepest oceans 
 But I walked upon the raging sea 
 Just to be with you, well I'd do anything 
 Where there's no price I would not pay, no 
 And just to be with you, well, I'd give anything 
 Oh yes, I would give my life away 
 Yes 
 And I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love 
 How I died upon the cross for your sins 
 And I know that you don't realize how much that I give you 
 But I promise, I would do it all again 
 And just to be with you, I've done everything 
 Well, there's no price I did not pay, no 
 Just to be with you, I gave everything 
 Oh yes, I gave my life away 
 Yes, I gave my life away 
 Yeah, yes, just to be with you 
 All just to be with you 
 All just to be with you 
 All just to be with you 
 (empty space until  3:16) 
 Don't Let Me Go 
 Take my heart and help me feel 
 Take my faith and make it real 
 Take my eyes and help me see 
 All the love surrounding me 
 Don't let me go 
 Hold me close to where You are 
 Don't let me go 
 Take my heart, take all of me 
 Take my loss and take my gain 
 Take my trials and take my pain 
 Take my life and let it be 
 All that You would have for me 
 Don't let me go 
 Hold me close to where You are 
 Don't let me go 
 Take my heart, take all of me 
 Don't let me go 
 Hold me close to where You are 
 Don't let me go 
 Take my heart, take all of me 
 Don't let me go 
 Take my heart, take all of me

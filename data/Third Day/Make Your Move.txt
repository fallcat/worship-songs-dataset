I'm looking around here for some kind of miracle 
 I'm looking around here for some kind of sign 
 I gotta believe there's a rhyme and a reason 
 For the faith that you find 
 I gotta admit that there's something I see in you 
 I know that it's something deep inside 
 But nevertheless, still I can't help but wonder 
 Would you really even care if I ever said goodbye 
 Well, goodbye 
 Well, you've got love and I've got time 
 Won't you make a move before I change my mind, yeah 
 And I want to believe it's true 
 I'm listening close 
 Won't You make your move now 
 I know that there's more to life than I've ever known 
 I feel it down deep inside my heart 
 And I am here to find what You're believing 
 And to know who you are 
 And If you care to share a minute of your time with me 
 Tell me now because I am hoping that I can believe 
 Give me a reason to trust what you're telling me 
 Lord knows I need it now, won't you show me how 
 Well, you've got love and I've got time 
 Won't you make a move before I change my mind, yeah 
 And I want to believe it's true 
 I'm listening close 
 Won't You make your move now 
 Make your move now 
 I'm looking around here for some kind of miracle 
 I'm looking around here for some kind of sign 
 I gotta believe there's a rhyme and a reason 
 For the faith that you find 
 Well, you've got love and I've got time 
 Won't you make a move before I change my mind now 
 And I'll give you a chance to say 
 Everything you want before I walk away 
 Well, I want to believe it's true 
 I'm listening close 
 Won't you make your move, yeah 
 Make your move now 
 Won't you make you move 
 Go ahead and make your move now

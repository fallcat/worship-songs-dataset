Hey mama, take a look at me now 
 Things are going fine here in the big town, 
 Hey mama, if you could only see 
 All of my friends and how they love me. 
 And I know you say I need Jesus 
 Mama can't you see I'm doing fine 
 Oh, yes I know 
 And I know you say I need Jesus 
 But mama I ain't got the time. 
 But mama I ain't got the time.  No, no. 
 Hey mama, it's been two long years 
 Since I have seen you - how I need you here 
 Hey mama, things they aren't the same 
 Since I last wrote you - Yea things have changed 
 And I know you say I need Jesus 
 Mama can't you see I'm doing fine 
 Oh, yes I know you say I need Jesus 
 But mama I ain't got the time. 
 No, I ain't got the time.  No, no. 
 No, no, mother. 
 No, no, mother. 
 Mother. 
 Well everything's going wrong 
 Yes, everything's going wrong 
 No, I can't take it no more 
 Well everything's going wrong 
 Yes, everything's going wrong 
 No, I can't take it no more 
 And I need Jesus, I guess I need Jesus, forgive me 
 Come into my life.  Come into my heart. 
 Precious Jesus 
 Precious Jesus 
 And I know you say I need Jesus 
 Mama can't you see I'm doing alright 
 And I know you say I need Jesus 
 But Mama He is in my life, 
 Yes, He is in my life.  Yeah, yeah! 
 Oh Mama, Jesus saved me. 
 Oh mother, yes, yes 
 Know that, mother, Jesus saved me 
 Oh, mother, mother, yeah

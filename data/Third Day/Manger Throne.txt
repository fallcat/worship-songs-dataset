What kind of King would leave His throne 
 In Heaven to make this earth His home? 
 While men seek fame and great renown 
 In lowliness our King comes down 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
 How we thank You that You've come 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
 A manger throne for God's own son 
 You left the sound of angels' praise 
 To come for men with unkind ways 
 And by this Baby's helplessness 
 The power of nations is laid to rest 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
 How we thank You that You've come 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
 A manger throne for God's own son 
 What kind of King would come so small 
 From glory to a humble stall? 
 That dirty manger is my heart too 
 I'll make it a royal throne for You 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
 How we thank You that You've come 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
 A manger throne for God's own son 
 (Jesus, Jesus, precious one) 
 Precious Jesus 
 (How we thank You that You've come) 
 Jesus, Jesus, precious one 
 A manger throne 
 (My heart is a throne) 
 My heart is a throne for God's own son

Father in Heaven 
 Lord, may Your name be glorified 
 Above all others 
 Above all this world 
 Above everything else in our lives 
 For nothing else in all of this world matters 
 But to live our lives for You and You alone 
 May Your wonders never cease 
 May Your Spirit never leave 
 May we ever long to see Your face 
 When we've turned from You again 
 Oh how quickly we forget 
 May we be reminded of Your grace 
 May wonders never cease 
 Beautiful Savior 
 Truly You proved Your love for us 
 While we were sinners in all our weakness 
 Still You gave Your life upon the cross 
 You saved us, Lord, from all of our transgressions 
 And delivered us into Your loving arms 
 May Your wonders never cease 
 May Your Spirit never leave 
 May we ever long to see Your face 
 When we've turned from You again 
 Oh how quickly we forget 
 May we be reminded of Your grace 
 May wonders never cease, oh 
 Father in Heaven 
 Lord, may Your name be glorified 
 Above all others 
 Above all this world 
 Above everything else that is in our lives 
 For nothing else in all of this world matters 
 But to live our life for You and You alone 
 May Your wonders never cease 
 May Your Spirit never leave 
 May we ever long to see Your face 
 When we've turned from You again 
 Oh how quickly we forget 
 May we be reminded of Your grace 
 May wonders never cease 
 May wonders never cease, Lord 
 May wonders, may Your wonders, Lord 
 May Your wonders never cease 
 Oh yeah 
 May Your wonders never cease, Lord 
 May Your Spirit never leave us 
 Oh, we ever long to see Your face 
 Show Your glory and Your grace 
 May wonders never cease 
 Oh yeah

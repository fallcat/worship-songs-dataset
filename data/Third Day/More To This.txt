People get ready 
 For something like you've never seen 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your heart 
 Open up your arms 
 And let the Spirit of the Saviour set you free 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 All rumors are true 
 I don't know about you 
 But I know there's more to this 
 People, here it is 
 Just what we've all been waiting for 
 Open up your eyes 
 Open up your heart 
 Open up your arms 
 And let the Spirit of the Saviour set you free 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 All rumors are true 
 I don't know about you 
 But I know there's more to this 
 Oh no, it does not all end here 
 Don't think this is the end 
 I will tell you again 
 That I know there's more to this 
 There's more to life 
 Than being born and dying 
 There's more to life 
 Than slowly growing old 
 If we are wise 
 We'll keep our eyes on Jesus 
 Or miss out on the very thing 
 That God has made us for 
 You ain't seen nothing yet 
 All rumors are true 
 I don't know about you 
 But I know there's more to this 
 Oh no, it does not all end here 
 Don't think this is the end 
 I will tell you again 
 That I know there's more to this

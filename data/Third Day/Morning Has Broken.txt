Morning has broken, like the first morning 
 Blackbird has spoken, like the first bird 
 Praise for the singing, praise for the morning 
 Praise for the springing fresh from the word 
 Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven 
 Like the first dew fall, on the first grass 
 Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden 
 Sprung in completeness where his feet pass 
 Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning 
 Born of the one light, Eden saw play 
 Praise with elation, praise every morning 
 God's recreation of the new day

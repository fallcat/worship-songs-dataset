Thought that I was all alone 
 Broken and afraid 
 But You were there with me 
 Yes, You were there with me 
 And I didn't even know 
 That I had lost my way 
 But You were there with me 
 Yes, You were there with me 
 'Til You opened up my eyes 
 I never knew 
 That I couldn't ever make it 
 Without You 
 Even though the journey's long 
 And I know the road is hard 
 Well, the One who's gone before me 
 You will help me carry on 
 After all that I've been through 
 Now I realize the truth 
 That I must go through the valley 
 To stand upon the mountain of God 
 And as I travel on the road 
 That You have lead me down 
 You are here with me 
 Yes, You are here with me 
 I have need for nothing more 
 Oh, now that I have found 
 That You are here with me 
 Yes, You are here with me 
 I confess from time to time 
 I lose my way 
 But You are always there 
 To bring me back again, yeah 
 Even though the journey's long 
 And I know the road is hard 
 Well, the One who's gone before me 
 You will help me carry on 
 After all that I've been through 
 Now I realize the truth 
 That I must go through the valley 
 To stand upon the mountain of God 
 Sometimes I think of where it is I've come from 
 And the things I've left behind 
 But of all I've had, what I possessed 
 Nothing can quite compare 
 With what's in front of me, yeah, you are 
 With what's in front of me, yeah, yeah 
 Even though the journey's long 
 And I know the road is hard 
 Well, the One who's gone before me 
 He will help me carry on 
 After all that I've been through 
 Now I realize the truth 
 That I must go through the valley (through the valley) 
 To stand upon the mountain. . . 
 Well, I must go through the valley 
 To stand upon the mountain. . . 
 Yes, I must go through the valley 
 To stand upon the mountain of God 
 Thought that I was all alone 
 Broken and afraid 
 But You are here with me 
 Yes, You are here with me

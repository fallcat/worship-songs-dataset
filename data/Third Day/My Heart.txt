I paint a picture, I think it's easier to live that way 
 But my heart is really broken 
 I'm not the man you think I am when you see me 
 Each day 
 Torn apart and then left open 
 Father come and fill me up 
 I can't wait for You to overflow my cup 
 My heart makes me wonder how much longer 
 Till You're coming back to take me away 
 My heart longs for You to fly right through the sky 
 And take me to the place where I 
 Will never feel my heart break down again 
 I search the sky and then I try imagining You there 
 Looking on anticipating 
 You're standing by and knowing I will join You in the air 
 Until then I'll be here waiting

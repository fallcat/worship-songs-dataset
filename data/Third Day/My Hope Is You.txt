To You, O Lord, I lift my soul 
 In You, O God, I place my trust 
 Do not let me be put to shame 
 Nor let my enemies triumph over me 
 My hope is You 
 Show me Your ways 
 Guide me in truth 
 In all my days 
 My hope is You 
 I am, O Lord, filled with Your love 
 You are, O God, my salvation 
 Guard my life and rescue me 
 My broken spirit shouts 
 My mended heart cries out 
 My hope is You 
 Show me Your ways 
 Guide me in truth 
 In all my days 
 My hope is You 
 My precious Jesus

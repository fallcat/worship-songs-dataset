Take me from my home 
 Drag me with a tether 
 Tell me it's all wrong, the things I've always known 
 Instill in me all that you think will make all of us better 
 Do just what you want it matters not to me 
 And I will never bow down 
 For I know I will be saved from the fire 
 And I will never compromise 
 All that I have and everything I own 
 Called the Son of Man 
 To show us what You have made 
 Command us all to fall 
 The music starts to fade 
 And everyone from everywhere 
 Will show You their allegiance 
 But the child of God will faithfully stand tall 
 And I will never bow down 
 For I know I will be saved from the fire 
 And I will never compromise 
 All that I have and everything I own 
 Oh no, oh no 
 I'll never bow down 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Aww yeah 
 And I will never bow down 
 For I know I will be saved from the fire 
 And I will never compromise 
 All that I have and everything I own 
 And I will never bow down 
 For I know we will be saved from the fire 
 And we will never compromise 
 All that we have and everything we hold 
 Oh no, oh no no 
 We'll never bow down

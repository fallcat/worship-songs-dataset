Third Day 1996 version: 
 On and on...and on…. and on….and on she goes 
 Where she stops no one really knows 
 Everybody's got a problem so it seems and 
 She ain't afraid of tellin' me, oh but 
 If you can't say nothing' good, don't say 
 Nothin' at all 
 On and on...and on…. and on….and on he goes 
 Now look who's the one playin' the fool 
 Criticizing, telling lies, and putting down 
 Ain't you got nothin' better to do, oh yeah, but 
 If you can't say nothin' good, don't say 
 Anything at all 
 'Cause I know that there are times in life 
 When we just can't keep it to ourselves 
 But to want is not to make it right 
 We've got to tame our tongue 
 If you can't say nothin' good, don't say 
 Nothin' at all 
 On and on...and on…. and on….and on we go 
 Playin' the game that never ends 
 I think it's time that we all realize 
 A broken heart is hard to mend, oh yeah but 
 If you can't say nothin' good, don't say 
 Anything at all 
 'Cause I know that there are times in life 
 When we just can't keep it to ourselves 
 But to want is not to make it right 
 We've got to tame our tongue 
 Well if you can't say nothin' good, don't say 
 Nothin' at all 
 Spoken: 
 Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. 
 Spoken: 
 All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by men, but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 
 Spoken: 
 With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness. Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be so. 
 Oh yeah 
 'Cause I know that there are times in life 
 When we just can't keep it to ourselves 
 But to want is not to make it right 
 We've got to tame our tongue 
 Well if you can't say nothin' good, don't say 
 Nothin' at all 
 Don't say nothing' at all 
 Don't say nothing at all 
 Don't say nothing at all

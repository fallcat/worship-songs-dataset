Offerings II album version: 
 I've heard all the stories 
 I've seen all the signs 
 Witnessed all the glory 
 Tasted all that's fine 
 But nothing compares 
 To the greatness of knowing You, Lord 
 Oh, no 
 Nothing compares 
 To the greatness of knowing You, Lord 
 Oh, no 
 I see all the people 
 Wasting all their time 
 Building up their riches, yes 
 For a life that's fine 
 But nothing compares 
 To the greatness of knowing You, Lord 
 Oh, no 
 Nothing compares 
 To the greatness of knowing You, Lord 
 Oh, no 
 Spoken: 
 Those words that were spoken and written by the Apostle Paul 
 Apply to our lives today just as they did two thousand years ago when he wrote them. 
 That in our lives no matter where we could go,or who we could meet, or what we could see, or what we could earn, or be given to us, or accomplish, 
 There is nothing in our lives that will ever even come close to the greatness of knowing Jesus Christ our Lord. 
 I find myself just living for today 
 'Cause I don't know what 
 Tomorrow's gonna bring 
 So now matter if I rise or fall 
 I'll never be alone, oh no 
 My Lord, nothing compares 
 To the greatness of knowing You, Lord 
 Oh, no 
 Nothing compares 
 To the greatness of knowing You, Lord 
 Sing it to Him now, nothing compares - spoken 
 Nothing compares 
 To the greatness of knowing You, Lord, oh no 
 Nothing compares to You, Lord 
 Nothing compares to You, Lord 
 Nothing compares, nothing compares 
 Nothing compares to You, Lord 
 No 
 Nothing compares to You, Lord 
 Nothing compares to You, Lord Jesus 
 Hallelujah, Lord 
 You are so beautiful 
 You are so wonderful to love us 
 So many need You, find Your faithfulness, Lord 
 We love You, Lord Jesus 
 Spoken: 
 May the Lord 
 May the Lord bless you 
 And may He keep you 
 And may He give you peace 
 God bless you all. 
 You have a great night.  Thank you.

Magnificent Holy Father 
 I stand in awe of all I see 
 Of all the things You have created 
 But still You choose to think of me 
 Who am I that You should suffer 
 Your very life to set me free 
 The only thing that I can give You 
 Is the life You gave to me 
 This is my offering, dear Lord 
 This is my offering to You, God 
 And I will give You my life 
 For it's all I have to give 
 Because You gave Your life for me 
 I stand before You at this altar 
 So many have given You more 
 I may not have much I can offer 
 Yet what I have is truly Yours 
 This is my offering, dear Lord 
 This is my offering to You, God 
 Well, I will give You my life 
 For it's all I have to give 
 Because You gave Your life for me 
 This is my offering 
 This is my offering, dear Lord 
 This is my offering to You, God 
 And I will give You my life 
 For it's all I have to give 
 Because You gave Your life for me 
 This is my offering 
 This is my offering to You, God 
 And I will give You my life 
 For it's all I have to give 
 Because You gave Your life for me, yes 
 Because You gave Your life for me 
 Oh yeah

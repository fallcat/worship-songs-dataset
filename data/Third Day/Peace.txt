Peace like a river flows within me 
 Love like a waterfall pours on me 
 I"ll never be alone, can't you see 
 Peace like a river flows, like a river flows on... 
 Hope is a fire burning in my soul 
 Life is eternal with you Lord 
 Who could ever ask for more 
 Peace like a river flows on... 
 ... On, think of all I could have missed 
 ... Oh, I just can't get over this 
 Faith is a light shining down on me 
 Mercy is a wind blowing over me 
 The grace of God has set me free 
 Peace like a river flows on... 
 * (Phil. 4:6&7, Isaiah 48:17&18)

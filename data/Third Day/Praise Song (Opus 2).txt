How many times have I turned away? 
 The number is the same as the sand on the shore 
 But every time You've taken me back 
 And now I pray You'll do it once more 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You Jesus 
 How many times have I turned away? 
 The number is the same as the stars in the sky 
 But every time You've taken me back 
 And now I pray You'll do it tonight

We praise You oh Lord for the love that  You give 
 And the time that You spent on this world for our sins 
 We lift up Your name in honor and praise 
 In Jesus we place all our love and our faith 
 And we know that You are the Savior 
 And we know that You are the Son 
 And we know that You are the Savior of everyone, everyone 
 The time is now near when You will appear 
 When we see Your face and Your voice we will hear 
 And then we will sing to Jesus the King 
 The Maker, Creator of everything 
 And we know that You are the Savior 
 And we know that You are the Son 
 And we know that You are the Savior of everyone, everyone 
 We praise You oh Lord for the love that  You give 
 and the time that You spent on this world for our sins 
 We lift up Your name in honor and praise 
 In Jesus we place all our love and our faith 
 And we know that You are the Savior 
 And we know that You are the Son 
 And we know that You are the Savior of everyone, everyone 
 Oh...

I'm ready for the winds to change 
 I'm ready for a brighter day 
 I'm ready for the sun to shine down on me 
 I'm waiting for a song to sing 
 I'm looking for a brand new thing 
 I'm ready now to live a life that I believe 
 I want the world to turn because of love 
 And mercy to find each of us 
 Doing what we can to just believe, yeah 
 I want the world to know that You're the One 
 Who fills me up and gives me hope 
 And brings about this change that's in me 
 Oh yeah, I'm ready.  Yeah 
 You know I'm ready now 
 I'm ready for the truth to be 
 Something that can set us free, yeah 
 Does anybody still believe we'll make it through 
 I'm ready now to take a stand 
 To live life for more than myself 
 Tell me now, my friend.  Are you ready, too 
 I want the world to turn because of love 
 And mercy to find each of us 
 Doing what we can to just believe, yeah 
 I want the world to know that You're the One 
 Who fills me up and gives me hope 
 And brings about this change that's in me 
 Oh, I'm ready.  Yeah 
 You know I'm ready now 
 I can't sit around waiting for it all to change 
 It's gonna take every single one of us doing what we can 
 There's lots of fighting in this world but there's so much loving, too 
 So take my hand, I'm ready now for You 
 I want the world to turn because of love 
 And mercy to find each of us 
 Doing what we can to just believe, yeah 
 I want the world to know that You're the One 
 Who fills me up and gives me hope 
 And brings about this change that's in me 
 Oh yeah, I'm ready.  Yeah

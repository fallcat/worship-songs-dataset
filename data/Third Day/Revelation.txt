My life has led me down the road that's so uncertain 
 Now I am left alone and I am broken 
 Trying to find my way 
 Trying to find the faith that's gone 
 This time I know that You are holding all the answers 
 I'm tired of losing hope and taking chances 
 On roads that never seem 
 To be the ones that bring me home 
 Give me a revelation 
 Show me what to do 
 'Cause I've been trying to find my way 
 I haven't got a clue 
 Tell me should I stay here 
 Or do I need to move 
 Give me a revelation 
 I've got nothing without You 
 I've got nothing without You 
 My life has led me down this path that's ever winding 
 Through every twist and turn I'm always finding 
 That I am lost again 
 Tell me when this road will ever end 
 Give me a revelation 
 Show me what to do 
 'Cause I've been trying to find my way 
 I haven't got a clue 
 Tell me should I stay here 
 Or do I need to move 
 Give me a revelation 
 I've got nothing without You 
 I've got nothing without 
 I don't know where I can turn 
 Tell me when will I learn 
 Won't You show me where I need to go, oh 
 Let me follow Your lead 
 I know that it's the only way that I can get back home 
 Give me a revelation 
 Show me what to do 
 'Cause I've been trying to find my way 
 I haven't got a clue, yeah 
 Tell me should I stay here 
 Or do I need to move 
 Give me a revelation 
 I've got nothing without You 
 I've got nothing without You, no 
 Oh, no 
 Oh, no 
 Oh, give me a revelationâ€¦ 
 Oh, oh 
 I've got nothing without You 
 I've got nothing without You

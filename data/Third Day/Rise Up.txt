Well, I was there when you were torn apart 
 Now a piece of you is gone 
 Somehow you wish that you could only find 
 A little strength to carry on 
 You've tried so hard to make it on your own 
 That your heart has come undone 
 So I am here to prove that I alone 
 Have the power to overcome 
 Don't let your heart be troubled 
 This world will never keep you down 
 It will never keep you down 
 So rise up, my friend 
 No, this will never be the end 
 So rise up, my friend 
 And live again 
 I didn't want you to feel this way 
 It's not what life was meant to be 
 And so for you, my friend, I'll take your shame 
 You can give it all to me 
 'Cause you've wrestled demons every day 
 And they've dragged you to your knees 
 But in your weakness you will learn to find 
 That I will always be your strength 
 In life or in death 
 Through joy or regret 
 And all of the secret things you have done 
 No matter what comes, my friend 
 Nothing can keep you from the love of God

I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 The drive and the determination 
 And the lucky breaks 
 I wanna be a rock star 
 Yeah but, I ain't got the face 
 Yes, I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 Seeing my face up on the TV 
 Hearing my songs on the radio 
 People waiting all day in line to see me 
 Doing my pose for Rolling Stone 
 Well, it's all right, yeah it's all right 
 I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 The drive and the determination 
 And the lucky breaks 
 I wanna be a rock star 
 Yeah but, I ain't got the face 
 Yes, I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 Living lifestyles of the rich and famous 
 Turning all heads in the music scene 
 Flying in my own jet plane to Vegas 
 Riding in a big black limousine 
 Well, it's all right, yeah it's all right 
 I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 The drive and the determination 
 And the lucky breaks 
 I wanna be a rock star 
 Yeah but, I ain't got the face 
 Yes, I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 No, I ain't got nothing 
 But, to you I'm something 
 Something so much more 
 Well, it's all right, yeah it's all right 
 Well, it's all right, yeah it's all right 
 I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 The drive and the determination 
 And the lucky breaks 
 I wanna be a rock star 
 Yeah but, I ain't got the face 
 Yes, I wanna be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 Oh, I said I want to be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes 
 Oh, I said I want to be a rock star 
 But, I ain't got what it takes

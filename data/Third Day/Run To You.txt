I was tired of waiting 
 Playing all the games and 
 Living in a place that was not for me 
 So I thought it was time 
 For me to get what's mine 
 And to do it all, everything I dreamed 
 What I thought was the best of me turned to be 
 All the worst I could find 
 If I run to You 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 If I run to You 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 Now I got a feeling 
 (Now I got a feeling) 
 That I've got to leave and 
 (That I've got to leave and) 
 Find a way back to where I came from 
 Though I don't deserve it 
 (Though I don't deserve it) 
 I know it's unheard but ( 
 I know it's unheard but) 
 Living here without You, my life is done 
 I confess that I shouldn't have run from You 
 Now I know I was wrong 
 If I run to You 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 If I run to You 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 Nowhere to run to 
 And no one to turn to 
 I'm dying out here on my own 
 Long before I even thought of returning 
 Your arms are wide open 
 Waiting for me to come home 
 Oh, oh yeah 
 (Waiting for) 
 Me to come home 
 Oh, oh yeah 
 If I run to You, yeah 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 If I run to You 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 If I run to You, yeah 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 If I run to You, yeah 
 Will You hold me in Your arms forevermore? 
 Oh, oh, oh, yeah 
 Oh, oh 
 (Come here, come here) 
 If I run to You 
 (Will You hold me?) 
 If I run to You 
 (Will You hold me?) 
 If I run to You 
 (Will You hold me, will You hold me?) 
 If I run to You 
 If I run to You 
 If I run to You

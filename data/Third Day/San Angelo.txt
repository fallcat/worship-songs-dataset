Forever seems so distant 
 Much further than today 
 You turn around and in an instant 
 You find that you were just as far from yesterday 
 The day it feels like winter 
 The night it feels like a storm 
 You turn around and you remember 
 When you're surrounded you can still feel so alone 
 But it's in between the start and end 
 I find myself once again questioning this place 
 Calling out your name 
 San Angelo, what do you know? 
 And tell me, do you have something to say? 
 Don't get me wrong 
 I miss my home 
 And it feels like I'm a million miles away 
 San Angelo 
 Why do I ask these questions 
 How come I have these doubts 
 'Cause I found every situation 
 It always seems to have it's way of working out 
 But it's in between the start and end 
 I find myself once again questioning this place 
 Calling out your name 
 I'm a million miles away 
 I miss my home 
 Don't get me wrong 
 I miss my home 
 And it feels like I'm a million miles away 
 I'm a million miles away 
 San Angelo 
 San Angelo

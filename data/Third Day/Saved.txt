I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined 
 Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb 
 By His grace I have been touched 
 By His Word I have been healed 
 By His hand I've been delivered 
 By His Spirit I've been sealed 
 And I've been saved by the blood of the Lamb 
 Yes, I'm saved by the blood of the Lamb 
 And I'm so glad 
 Yes, I'm so glad 
 I am so glad 
 (So glad) 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 Thank You, Lord 
 Thank You, Lord 
 By His truth I can be upright 
 By His strength I do endure 
 By His power I've been lifted 
 By His Love I am secure 
 He bought me with a price 
 Freed me from the pit 
 Full of emptiness and wrath 
 And the fire that burns in it 
 And I've been saved by the blood of the Lamb 
 Thank God, I've been saved by the blood of the Lamb 
 By the blood of the Lamb 
 I'm so glad 
 Yes, I'm so glad 
 That I'm so glad 
 (So glad) 
 Oh 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 I just want to thank You, Lord 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 Thank You, Lord 
 Nobody to rescue me 
 Nobody was there 
 I was going down for the last time 
 By His mercy I've been spared 
 Not by works 
 By faith in Him is all 
 For so long I've been hindered 
 For so long I've been stalled 
 Now I'm saved by the blood of the Lamb 
 By the precious blood 
 Thank God, I've been saved by the blood of the Lamb 
 Yes, I'm saved 
 Well, Lord, I'm saved 
 And I'm so glad 
 Oh, Lord, I am so glad 
 Yes, I am so glad 
 Oh, Lord, I am so glad 
 You know I am so glad 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 I just want to thank You, Lord 
 I want to thank You, Lord 
 Thank the Lord 
 Thank You, Lord 
 I just want to thank Him 
 By the blood of the Lamb 
 I've been saved 
 Yes, I'm saved 
 By the blood of the Lamb 
 Thank God I've been saved 
 By the blood of the Lamb 
 I've been saved 
 By the blood of the Lamb

The voice of an angel, I cannot tell 
 Light or darkness, heaven or hell 
 The smile of a believer, wedged and bound 
 Friend or deceiver, the truth or a lie 
 She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes 
 Say everything and nothing at the same time 
 Still there's something to lose my mind 
 She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes 
 Words of a poet, in perfect time 
 With Christians and answers, 
 Every verse, every line 
 But I smile and I wonder, is there a song 
 I'm not always silent. 
 Is it right, is it wrong?

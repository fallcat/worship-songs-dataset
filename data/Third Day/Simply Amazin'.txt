Whoever though that the son of God, 
 Would humble Himself come down to Earth? 
 Born the King of Kings, 
 Hear the angels sing. 
 Simply amazin' 
 And whoever thought that He'd heal the Blind, 
 Feed the hungry, tell the dead to rise? 
 Well, the deaf can hear, 
 Now the blind can see. 
 Simply amazin' 
 That's not the half of it, 
 You haven't heard the best. 
 You ain't seen nothing yet, 
 He is simply amazin' 
 Whoever though that He'd be betrayed, 
 Loved us so much He gave his life away. 
 He died for you and me up on Calvary, 
 Simply amazin' 
 Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, 
 That saved a wretch like me. 
 Well, I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see. 
 Whoever thought that He'd ever die, 
 And on that third day come back to life? 
 See Him live and breathe. Let us all believe, 
 Simply amazin'

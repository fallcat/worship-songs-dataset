People talkin' like it's the end of time 
 I look up to the heavens for a sign 
 Everybody's lookin' at me 
 But I won't be deceived or afraid 
 'Cause I know that the sun is on the way 
 Sky falls down 
 It crumbles into the sea 
 The sun goes out 
 He's coming back for me 
 I'll be found at the place 
 Where the gravity leaves the ground 
 I won't be comin' down 
 I've heard rumors that war's not far away 
 If they take me I know just what to say 
 Everybody's up in arms 
 But I won't be alarmed or afraid 
 'Cause I know that the sun is on the way

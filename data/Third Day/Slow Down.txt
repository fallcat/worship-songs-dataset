Spoken 
 All right, let's rock it 
 Tell me to slow down 
 If You think that the road that I'm on's going nowhere 
 Tell me to slow down 
 If You know that I'm going too fast for my own good 
 Tell me to slow down 
 If the way is leading to a dead end 
 Tell me to slow down 
 Turn around, let me change the way I'm going 
 Oh, I don't want to let go 
 Of all the things that I know 
 Are keeping me away from my life 
 Oh, I don't want to slow down 
 No, I don't want to look around 
 But I can't seem to work it out 
 So help me God 
 Tell me to slow down 
 If You see that I'm running too fast in the wrong race 
 Tell me to slow down 
 If You think that I can't keep up with my own pace 
 Tell me to slow down 
 'Cause You know if there's ever any question 
 Tell me to slow down 
 Turn around, and I'm changing my direction 
 Oh, I don't want to let go 
 Of all the things that I know 
 Are keeping me away from my life 
 Oh, I don't want to slow down 
 No, I don't want to look around 
 But I can't seem to work it out 
 So help me God 
 Oh, tell me to slow down 
 Oh, tell me to slow down now 
 Oh, tell me to slow down 
 Oh, I don't want to let go 
 Of all the things that I know 
 Are keeping me away from my life 
 Oh, I don't want to slow down 
 No, I don't want to look around 
 But I can't seem to work it out 
 I can't work it out 
 Oh, I don't want to slow down 
 No, I don't want to look around 
 But I can't seem to work it out 
 So help me God 
 (So help me God) 
 Oh, tell me to slow down 
 (So help me God) 
 Oh, tell me to slow down now 
 (So help me God) 
 Oh, tell me to slow down 
 (So help me)

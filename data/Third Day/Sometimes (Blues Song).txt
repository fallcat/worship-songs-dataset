Sometimes we need someone, 
 To take away the pain. 
 Sometimes we need a love, 
 To wipe away the tears that fall down like rain. 
 Well if you need someone, 
 Why don't you turn back to Jesus? 
 Sometimes we need a friend, 
 To help us carry on. 
 Sometimes we're full of sin, 
 That's why God sent His only son. 
 Well if you need someone, 
 Why don't you turn back to Jesus? 
 Cause He is the one that loves you and me. 
 I've got a friend you should know about, 
 He's someone you cannot live without, 
 He's my best friend, His name is Jesus.

God, I'm running for Your heart 
 I'm running for Your heart 
 Till I am a soul on fire 
 Lord, I'm longing for Your ways 
 I'm waiting for the day 
 When I am a soul on fire 
 Till I am a soul on fire 
 Lord, restore the joy I had 
 And I have wandered bring me back 
 In this darkness, lead me through 
 Until all I see is You 
 Lord, let me burn for You again 
 Let me return to You again 
 And Lord, let me burn for You again 
 Let me return to You again 
 God, I'm running for Your heart 
 I'm running for Your heart 
 Till I am a soul on fire 
 I want to be 
 Till I am a soul on fire 
 Till I am a soul on fire

I ran away from Your love 
 But You waited for me 
 Yes, You waited for me 
 And then I heard Your song 
 Singing over me 
 Singing over me 
 Now that I hear You, Lord 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to know You more 
 Sing Your song to me 
 Oh, there's no greater thing 
 Than to listen to the sound of Your voice 
 When I hear Your song 
 I want to sing along 
 And listen to the sound of Your voice 
 The sound of Your voice 
 Lord, I'm calling Your name 
 And I'm waiting for You 
 Yes, I'm waiting for You 
 So won't You show me Your way 
 And I will follow You 
 Yes, I will follow You 
 And now that I hear You, Lord 
 I want to know You more 
 I want to know You more 
 Sing Your song to me 
 Oh, there's no greater thing 
 Than to listen to the sound of Your voice 
 When I hear Your song 
 I want to sing along 
 And listen to the sound of Your voice 
 The sound of Your voice 
 Singing over me 
 Bringing peace and mercy 
 With a song that never ends 
 Singing over me 
 Marvelous and holy 
 Lord, I want to hear Your song again 
 Sing Your song to me 
 Oh, there's no greater thing 
 Than to listen to the sound of Your voice, yeah 
 When I hear Your song 
 I want to sing along 
 And listen to the sound of Your voice 
 The sound of Your voice 
 I want to hear Your song 
 I want to hear Your voice 
 I ran away from Your love 
 But You waited for me 
 Yes, You waited for me

There was a time when I thought that I had You figured out 
 I told You before and I'll say it once more 
 Now and then I have my doubts 
 I'll never pretend to know what You are doing 
 It's true that You move in mysterious ways 
 I looked for You in 
 The fire and in the wind 
 But You weren't there as far as I could see 
 I thought I'd hear You shout 
 But then I figured it out 
 That all along You're whispering to me 
 And I'm still listening 
 Just when I thought that I had caught a glimpse of who You are 
 You taught me a lesson I needed to learn 
 Right from the very start 
 I never will be the man that I quite need to be 
 But that's alright 'cause You're enough for me

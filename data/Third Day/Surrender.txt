When the day began 
 And you opened up your eyes 
 No, you didn't recognize 
 What you were seeing 
 Then it all came back 
 You remembered where you've been 
 Well, it never seems to end 
 And you're still running 
 Will you ever change your mind 
 You're almost out of time 
 You better give up 
 Gotta stop running 
 It's the end of the line 
 It's time to surrender 
 Hands up 
 Turn it around 
 Fall to the ground 
 Are you gonna surrender 
 Now the day is done 
 And you want to close your eyes 
 And pretend that you are fine 
 But you'd be lying 
 And you want it back 
 The life that you once had 
 'Cause inside you find 
 That you are slowly dying 
 Will you ever change your mind 
 You're almost out of time 
 You better give up 
 Gotta stop running 
 It's the end of the line 
 It's time to surrender 
 Hands up 
 Turn it around 
 Fall to the ground 
 Are you gonna surrender 
 Give up 
 Gotta stop running 
 It's the end of the line 
 It's time to surrender 
 Hands up 
 Turn it around 
 Fall to the ground 
 Are you gonna surrender, yeah 
 Are you gonna surrender 
 Oh yeah 
 You better give up 
 Gotta stop running 
 It's the end of the line 
 It's time to surrender 
 Hands up 
 Turn it around 
 Fall to the ground 
 You better give up 
 Gotta stop running 
 It's the end of the line 
 It's time to surrender 
 Hands up 
 Turn it around 
 Fall to the ground 
 Are you gonna surrender 
 Yeah 
 Are you gonna surrender 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Surrender 
 Surrender

All the promises I've broken 
 All the times I've let You down 
 You've forgot them 
 But still I hold on to the pain that makes me drown 
 Now I'm ready 
 To let it go 
 To give it away 
 Take it all 
 'Cause I can't take it any longer 
 All I have I can't make it on my own 
 Take the first, take the last 
 Take the good and take the rest 
 Here I am, all I have 
 Take it all 
 All the roads that lie before me 
 All the struggles I go through 
 Every second I'm reminded 
 That it all belongs to You 
 Now I'm ready 
 To let it go 
 To give it away 
 Take it all 
 'Cause I can't take it any longer 
 All I have I can't make it on my own 
 Take the first, take the last 
 Take the good and take the rest 
 Here I am, all I have 
 Take it all 
 Ever since I died to myself 
 You gave a better life to me 
 I give You my finest moment 
 I give You the last breath I breathe 
 Take it all 
 'Cause I can't take it any longer 
 All I have I can't make it on my own 
 Take the first, take the last 
 Take the good and take the rest 
 Take it all 
 'Cause I can't take it any longer 
 All I have I can't make it on my own 
 Take the first, take the last 
 Take the good and take the rest 
 Here I am, all I have 
 Take it all

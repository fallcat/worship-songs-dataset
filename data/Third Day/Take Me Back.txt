It's your heart that keeps you running 
 And it's your mind that I can't change 
 Will you ever be returning 
 And coming back again, coming back again 
 Take me back to the place where it started 
 Take me back to the warmth of the sun 
 To the place where the rivers meet the ocean 
 Take me back home 
 Yeah, that's where I belong 
 And have you ever really wondered 
 As we walk beneath the stars 
 Will we find the truth, will we discover 
 It isn't very far, it's not so very far 
 I wonder if I've gone too far 
 Lord, please help me get back home 
 Where I belong 
 Back where I belong 
 Where I belong 
 Oh, where I belong 
 Yeah, that's where I belong 
 It's your heart that keeps you running

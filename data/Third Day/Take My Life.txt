Third Day 1996 album version: 
 How many times have I turned away 
 The number is the same as the sand on the shore 
 But every time You've taken me back. 
 And now I pray You do it once more. 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You Jesus 
 How many times have I turned away 
 The number is the same as the stars in the sky 
 But every time You've taken me back 
 And now I pray You do it tonight. 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 Offerings II album version: 
 Spoken: 
 We're going to teach you all a song 
 Well, some of you may know it, it's from our first record. 
 But, uh, we're going to tape it tonight just to see how it sounds with all you singing, all right? 
 Yeah. 
 So, a little practice run through, the words go like this: 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 Uh, and it goes like this: 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Please take from me my life - spoken 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away - spoken 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 Spoken: 
 That's not bad, that's pretty doggone good. 
 Let's see how you sound. 
 How many times have I turned away 
 The number is the same as the sand on the shore 
 Every time You've taken me back 
 And now I pray You'll do it once more 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 How many times have I gone astray 
 The number is the same as the stars in the skies 
 Every time You've taken me back 
 And now I pray You'll do it tonight 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 You sing - spoken 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You 
 Oh 
 Please take from me my life 
 When I don't have the strength 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 To give it away to You, Jesus 
 Yeah, that sounded great.  That's awesome. - Spoken

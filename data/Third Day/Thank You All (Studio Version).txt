Ready or not, well, here we go 
 Giving all we got like it's all our show 
 'Cause I guess you'll never know 
 What's gonna happen? 
 In the sunshine or driving rain 
 Hit the ground running like a big 'ol train 
 'Cause we don't know 
 When we're comin' back again 
 Thank you all for the good times that you bring 
 For the songs sound much better when you sing 
 Thank you all most of all for listening 
 So this song says, "Thank you all" 
 Ready or not, well, here we go 
 Where are we headed I don't know? 
 Could tomorrow be as good as it was today? 
 Riding in a bus down the interstate 
 Got another show in another place 
 But we won't forget you when we've gone away 
 When all is said and done 
 And all the lights are faded 
 We'll thank the Lord above for this moment

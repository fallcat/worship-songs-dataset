Ruler of the universe 
 Higher than the kings of earth 
 Long before the world began 
 Everything was in Your hands 
 Your glory will forever stand 
 For You are the Lord 
 And You are God above 
 Your love goes on and on 
 You are the everlasting Father 
 (You are the everlasting) 
 You are the everlasting light, oh yeah 
 Every knee shall bow (every knee shall bow) to You 
 You are the everlasting life 
 Through the raging of the seas 
 The hills proclaim Your majesty 
 All these things created for 
 The glorifying of the Lord 
 We praise Your name forevermore 
 For You are the Lord 
 And You are God above 
 Your love goes on and on 
 You are the everlasting Father 
 (You are the everlasting) 
 You are the everlasting light, oh yeah 
 Every knee shall bow (every knee shall bow) to You 
 Lord of mercy (we adore You now) 
 You are the everlasting life 
 My heart cries out 
 My spirit shouts 
 I'll praise Your name forevermore 
 You are the everlasting Father 
 (You are the everlasting) 
 You are the everlasting light, oh yeah 
 Every knee shall bow (every knee shall bow) before You 
 Lord of mercy (we adore You now) 
 You are the everlasting life

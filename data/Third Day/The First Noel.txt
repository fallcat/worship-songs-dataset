The first Noel, the angels did say, 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay; 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep, 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep. 
 They looked up and saw a star 
 Shining in the East, beyond them far; 
 And to the earth, it gave a great light, 
 And so it continued both day and night. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel. 
 Born is the King 
 The first Noel, the angels did say, 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay; 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel. 
 Born is the King of Israel.

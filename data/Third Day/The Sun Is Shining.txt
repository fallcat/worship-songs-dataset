Yesterday I found 
 That everything I knew was wrong 
 It was upside down 
 The life I thought I had was gone 
 But You came and whispered love to me 
 And You gave me strength to carry on 
 Oh, the sun is shining 
 There is hope for me again 
 A new day's dawning 
 The sun is shining 
 Yesterday I lost 
 Everything I had and loved 
 Then I cried out for You, Lord 
 And You came and picked me up 
 And the sorrow lasted through the night 
 But the joy came with the morn 
 I will lift my voice 
 No, I won't be silent 
 For You heard my cry 
 And You turned my mourning into dancing 
 And so forever I'll sing

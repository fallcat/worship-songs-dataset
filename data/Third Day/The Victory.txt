I've been fighting like a soldier 
 From the day that I was born 
 Trying to make it through the hard times of this cruel world 
 But I'm keeping my head up 
 Even if I am alone 
 And I'll be fighting 'til the good Lord takes me home 
 Well I've been running in a long race 
 Trying to get to the prize 
 Doing everything that I can 
 To stay alive 
 But I'm never gonna give up 
 Even if I am alone 
 And I'll be running 'til the good Lord takes me home 
 I'll run the race that need to be run 
 I'll fight the fight that needs to be won 
 Are you listenin' 
 I'll do what it takes for me to survive 
 I'll never give up or compromise 
 I do believe I'll walk away 
 With a victory 
 I've been working my whole life 
 To be the best that I can 
 And I'm willing to sacrifice 
 All that I have 
 And I'm never gonna give up 
 Even if I am alone 
 And I'll be working 'til the good Lord takes me home 
 I'll run the race that need to be run 
 I'll fight the fight that needs to be won 
 Are you listenin' 
 I'll do what it takes for me to survive 
 I'll never give up or compromise 
 I do believe I'll walk away 
 With a victory 
 I'm never gonna give up fighting 
 I'm never gonna stop 
 Until I'm done 
 And even if it costs my life 
 You'll see me when the kingdom comes 
 I'll run the race that need to be run 
 I'll fight the fight that needs to be won 
 Are you listenin' 
 I'll do what it takes for me to survive 
 I'll never give up or compromise 
 I do believe I'll walk away 
 With a victory

These thousand hills roll ever on 
 Footprints of a Mighty God 
 They bring me to my knees in praise 
 Amazing love, amazing grace 
 Was on a hill my Savior died 
 A broken heart and bleeding side 
 Hill of the Skull, Mount Calvary 
 The blood He shed, He shed for me 
 When Heaven's hills at last I roam 
 Forever settled in my home 
 I'll join the saints around Your throne 
 Your kingdom, Lord, rolls ever on 
 La la la…. 
 These thousand hills roll ever on 
 Footprints of a Mighty God 
 They bring me to my knees in praise 
 Amazing love, amazing grace 
 These thousand hills roll ever on 
 Ripples of a coming storm 
 The morning star precedes the dawn 
 These thousand hills roll ever on 
 La la la….

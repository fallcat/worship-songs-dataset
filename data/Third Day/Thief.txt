Third Day (1996) album version: 
 I am a thief, I am a murderer 
 Walking up this lonely hill 
 What have I done?  No, I don't remember 
 No one knows just how I feel 
 And I know that my time is coming soon. 
 It's been so long. Oh, such a long time 
 Since I've lived with peace and rest 
 Now I am here, at my destination 
 I guess things work for the best. 
 And I know that my time is coming soon 
 Who is this man?  This man beside me 
 They call the King of the Jews 
 Oh, they don't believe that He's the Messiah 
 But, somehow I know that it's true. 
 They laugh at Him in mockery, 
 And they beat Him till He bleeds 
 And they nail Him to the rugged cross, 
 And raise Him, yeah they raise Him, they raise Him up next to me 
 My time has come, and I'm slowly fading 
 But I deserve what I receive 
 Jesus when You are in Your kingdom 
 Could You please, please remember me 
 And He looks at me still holding on 
 The tears fall from His eyes 
 And He says I tell the truth 
 Today, you will be with Me in paradise, oh yes 
 And I know that my time, my time is coming soon, oh yeah, yes 
 And I know that my time,  my time is coming soon, yeah, yeah 
 And I know Paradise, Paradise is coming soon.

I'm a son of a good man 
 I'm the child of an angel 
 I'm the brother of a wild one 
 And I'm looking for direction 
 I'm the lover of a beauty 
 I'm the father of blessings 
 I'm a singer of a love song 
 But is that all I'm good for 
 This is who I am, oh 
 This is who I am 
 So take me and make me something so much more 
 This is who I am, oh 
 This is who I am 
 So change me and make me someone better than before 
 I'm a saint and a sinner 
 I'm a lover and a fighter 
 I'm a true believer with great desire 
 I'm a preacher of grace prophet of love teacher of truth 
 I've fallen down so many times 
 But here I stand in front of You, yeah 
 This is who I am, oh 
 This is who I am 
 So take me and make me something so much more 
 This is who I am, oh 
 This is who I am 
 So change me and make me someone better than before 
 Take me as I am 
 But please don't leave me that way 
 'Cause I know that You can make me better than I am today 
 Oh, better than today, oh 
 This is who I am, oh 
 This is who I am 
 So take me and make me something so much more 
 This is who I am, oh 
 This is who I am 
 So change me and make me someone better than before

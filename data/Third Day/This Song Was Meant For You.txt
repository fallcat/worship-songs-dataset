Where did I go wrong? 
 Tell me what I have done here 
 It didn't take too long 
 For the sun to disappear 
 Now it's gone and I'm alone 
 This song was meant for you 
 It had a happy ending 
 But you have to change your mind 
 I don't know what happened 
 Thought that you would never leave 
 Is a song forever? 
 Life for you will surely change 
 Maybe for the better 
 None of this turned out 
 Quite the way I had planned it 
 But I know that in the end 
 It will work out for best 
 Still you're gone 
 And I'm alone 
 This song was meant for you 
 It had a happy ending 
 But you have to change your mind 
 I don't know what happened 
 Thought that you would never leave 
 Is a song forever? 
 Life for you will surely change 
 Maybe for the better 
 You never know what the future holds for you 
 But of all I have heard this one thing's true 
 Nothing can separate us from God's love 
 In out lives there is bound to come some pain 
 Surely as there are storms and falling rain 
 Just believe that the one who holds the storms 
 Will bring the sun 
 This song was meant for you 
 It had a happy ending 
 But you have to change your mind 
 I don't know what happened 
 Thought that you would never leave 
 Is a song forever? 
 Life for you will surely change 
 Maybe for the better

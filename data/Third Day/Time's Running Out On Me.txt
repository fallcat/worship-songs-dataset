There's so many places I wanna see 
 So many things that I wanna be 
 But time's running out on me 
 There's so many places I gotta go 
 So many things that I need to know 
 But time's running out on me 
 Time's running out on me 
 Tell me how this started 
 Look what I've become 
 Here with all of my regrets and broken dreams 
 Are you gonna help me find the strength to carry on 
 'Cause time's running out on me, yeah 
 Time's running out on me 
 There's so many things that I've yet to do 
 So many things that I need to prove 
 But time's running out on me 
 So many things that I need to say 
 But I let the words get in the way 
 And time's running out on me, yeah 
 Time's running out on me, yeah 
 Time is running out on me 
 Now the end is near... 
 Time's running out on me...

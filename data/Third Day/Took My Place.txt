Lost like a little child 
 Helpless as a baby 
 Searchin' desperately to find 
 Someone who could save me 
 Then along came from out of nowhere 
 Precious as the light of day 
 You gave me something no one could take 
 Away 
 When you took my place 
 Chained like a prisoner 
 From the day I was born 
 Blamed like a criminal 
 For the things that I'd done 
 Then along came from out of nowhere 
 Precious as the light of day 
 You gave me something no one could take 
 Away 
 When you took my place 
 Repeat

One of these days we all will stand in judgment for 
 Every single word that we have spoken 
 One of these days we all will stand before the Lord 
 Give a reason for everything we've done 
 And what I've done is 
 Trust in Jesus 
 My great Deliverer 
 My strong Defender 
 The Son of God 
 I trust in Jesus 
 Blessed Redeemer 
 My Lord forever 
 The Holy One, the Holy One 
 What are you going to do when your time has come 
 And your life is done and there's nothing you can stand on 
 What will you have to say at the judgement throne 
 I already know the only thing that I can say I 
 Trust in Jesus 
 My great Deliverer 
 My strong Defender 
 The Son of God 
 I trust in Jesus 
 Blessed Redeemer 
 My Lord forever 
 The Holy One 
 There's nothing I can do on my own to find forgiveness 
 It's by His grace alone I trust in Jesus 
 Trust in Jesus 
 I trust in Jesus 
 My great Deliverer 
 My strong Defender 
 The Son of God 
 I trust in Jesus 
 Blessed Redeemer 
 My Lord forever 
 The Holy One, the Holy One 
 I trust in Jesus 
 I trust in Jesus 
 My great Deliverer 
 My strong Defender 
 Blessed Redeemer 
 My Lord forever 
 Oh, yeah

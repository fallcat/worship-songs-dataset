Well, I won't pretend to know what you're thinking 
 And I can't begin to know what you're going through 
 And I won't deny the pain that you're feeling 
 But I'm gonna try and give a little hope to you 
 Just remember what I told you 
 There's so much you're living for 
 There's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 There's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 For you, for you 
 And there's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 Shining bright at the end of this tunnel 
 For you, for you 
 So keep holdin' on 
 You got your disappointments and sorrows 
 And you ought to share the weight of that load with me 
 Then you will find that the light of tomorrow 
 Well it brings new life for your eyes to see 
 So remember what I told you 
 There's so much you're living for 
 There's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 There's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 For you, for you, yeah 
 And there's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 Shining bright at the end of this tunnel 
 For you, for you 
 So keep holdin' on 
 Keep holding' on 
 So remember what I told you 
 There's so much you're living for 
 There's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 There's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 For you, for you, yeah 
 There's a light at the end of this tunnel 
 Shining bright at the end of this tunnel for you, for you, yeah

 Keep holding on now 
 You got your disappointments and sorrows 
 But I'm gonna try and give a little hope to you

Now listen there's something much better 
 Than what I had and what I had been told 
 And now one day I heard a message spoken, 
 Forever in my heart the words I hold 
 The Healer said there is only one river 
 The river of life, filled with faith and love 
 It's flowing from the sacrifice of Jesus, and 
 Brings us all into the Kingdom of God. 
 So I'm going down, to drown myself today 
 Nothin' left to live for, nothin' in my way 
 Hold me underwater, take me even farther 
 Drown me down by the river today 
 Will you make me a believer? 
 Take me by my hand, hold me as I'm falling in, 
 Cleanse me and wash my sins 
 So here I am at the edge of the water 
 That separates me from my death and life 
 And still I come here with unanswered questions 
 But that's not gonna to make me change my mind

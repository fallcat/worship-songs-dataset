Rich young man, you think you can 
 Make it through the world on the things 
 You've got 
 I'll tell you, I know it's true 
 You can't get to heaven on things you've 
 Bought 
 They're going to leave you 
 They're going to fade away 
 What good is it a man 
 To gain the whole world 
 And forfeit his soul 
 What good is it a man 
 To gain the whole world 
 And forfeit his soul 
 Poor old soul, he got more 
 Than the kings of a thousand countries 
 What he owns ain't silver or gold 
 This boy is bound for glory 
 He's going to leave us 
 He going to fly away

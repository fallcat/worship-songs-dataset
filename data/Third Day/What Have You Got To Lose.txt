Sin and shame 
 Guilt and pain 
 Pride and your conceit 
 Here and now 
 Lay them down 
 At the Savior's feet 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 And tell me why you're so afraid 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 Think of all you have to gain 
 Hope and dreams 
 And all the things 
 That you have ever made 
 It don't mean much 
 If in the end 
 You have lost your way 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 And tell me why you're so afraid 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 Think of all you have to gain 
 Let go of all you know 
 Only then can life be found 
 Surrender all you hold 
 Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 And tell me why you're so afraid 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 Think of all you have to gain 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 Lay it down now, lay it down 
 What have you got to lose 
 What have you got to lose 
 Think of all you have to gain 
 Spoken: 
 All right, try again

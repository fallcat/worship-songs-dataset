I was a sailor, I was lost at sea 
 I was under the waves 
 Before love rescued me 
 I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread 
 Now I stand accused of the things I've said 
 Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
 When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
 Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
 But I did what I did before love came to town 
 I used to make love under a red sunset 
 I was making promises I was soon to forget 
 She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown 
 But I left her standing before love came to town 
 I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream 
 The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream 
 As the music played I saw my life turn around 
 That was the day before love came to town 
 When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
 When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
 Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
 But I did what I did before love came to town 
 When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train 
 When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
 Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
 But I did what I did before love came to town 
 I was there when they crucified my Lord 
 I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword 
 I threw the dice when they pierced his side 
 But I've seen love conquer the great divide 
 When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train 
 When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame 
 Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down 
 But I did what I did before love came to town

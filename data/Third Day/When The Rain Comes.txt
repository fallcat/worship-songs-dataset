When the rain comes it seems that everyone has 
 Gone away 
 When the night falls you wonder if you shouldn't 
 Find someplace 
 To run and hide 
 Escape the pain 
 But hiding's such lonely thing to do 
 I can't stop the rain 
 From falling down on you again 
 I can't stop the rain 
 But I will hold you till it goes away 
 When the rain comes you blame it on the things 
 That you have done 
 When the storm fades you know that rain must fall 
 On everyone 
 So rest awhile 
 It'll be all right 
 No one loves you like I do 
 When the rain comes 
 I will hold you

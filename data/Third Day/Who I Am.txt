I need to be someone who's a lot like you 
 Easy to see that I sure need something new 
 Though I try to live life my way 
 I think it goes to prove 
 That I need to be someone who's like you 
 And I know that you want to change me 
 Wanna rearrange the way I feel inside 
 And I've heard that you take 
 The broken hearts of lonely souls 
 And you make all things right 
 But you know who I am 
 Have you seen the things I've done? 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Have you seen the things I've done?(The things I've done) 
 Never before, no there's never been a time 
 That I would implore you to take what's yours and mine 
 And to use it in the way you will 
 In any way you find 
 Never before did I realize 
 And now I know that you want to change me 
 Wanna rearrange the way I feel inside 
 And I've heard that you take 
 The broken hearts of lonely souls 
 And you make all things right 
 But do you know who I am? 
 Have you seen the things I've done? 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Have you seen the things I've done? 
 Do you know who I am? 
 And have you seen the things I've done?yeah 
 Do you know who I am? 
 And have you seen the things I've done?yeah 
 Do you know? Do you know who I am? 
 Have you seen what I've done?yeah 
 Do you know who I am? 
 And have you seen the things I've done?(The things I've done) 
 ...Oh... the things I've done... oh... do you know?...(Do I know?)

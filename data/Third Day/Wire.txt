Turn on the spotlight 
 Strike up the band 
 Everyone's looking my way 
 You came to see the excitement first hand 
 Hear all that I've got to say 
 And oh it makes me wonder 
 What if I slip will they catch me 
 Or watch me fall 
 I am walking on a wire 
 Tiptoeing through the fire 
 Never looking down to see 
 And I am walking on a wire 
 The pressure's getting higher 
 But I don't look around 
 Everyone roots for the winner 
 The others, well maybe next time 
 The time at the top only last fifteen minutes 
 Then they'll just leave you behind 
 Oh it makes me wonder 
 What if I slip will they catch me 
 Or watch me fall 
 It's so far to the ground 
 Will you catch me 
 If I fall 
 Will you catch me 
 If I fall 
 What if I slip will they catch me 
 Or watch me fall 
 It's so far to the ground 
 I'm never looking down

It doesn't take much 
 For my heart to break 
 And you have done it 
 For what seems 
 The millionth time 
 Whenever I hear 
 Of your saving grace 
 And how you gave your life 
 In exchange for mine 
 Sometimes I wonder why 
 You even love me 
 And why you ever 
 Chose to call me child 
 Then I remember 
 It's by your sacrifice 
 I can say that 
 I am your's 
 And you are mine 
 It doesn't take much 
 For me to shed a tear 
 And you have done 
 So many things 
 To make me cry 
 Whenever I think 
 Of all that I've 
 Done wrong 
 And everything 
 That you have done 
 To make it right 
 It doesn't take much 
 For my heart to break 
 And you have done it 
 For what seems 
 The millionth time

Your eyes, they shine 
 Unlike anything I've ever seen 
 Your smile, it lights up the skies 
 I hear your voice 
 And it's given me a song to sing 
 Your fire, it's burning inside 
 So take my hand 
 Take my spirit and 
 Shine your light on me 
 Imagine my surprise 
 The fire in your eyes 
 More than I hoped it could be 
 You are my everything 
 You are my everything 
 My world was changed 
 From the moment that I saw your face 
 My life has finally begun 
 You are my everything 
 (When I'm lost in the dark) 
 You are my everything 
 (When I'm falling apart) 
 You are the song I sing 
 (I'll tell the world who You are) 
 You are my everything 
 Well, I've been in love before 
 But it's never felt like this 
 When you're knockin' at my door 
 How can I resist? 
 And I'll give you all I have 
 And I hope that you believe 
 I'd do anything you want in this world 
 Just to have you here with me 
 You are my everything 
 You are my everything...

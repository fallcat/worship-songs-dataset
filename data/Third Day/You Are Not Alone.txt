I am always here 
 How's it make you feel to know 
 That you're not alone 
 Even when you cry 
 I will hold you tight 
 And say don't you be afraid 
 Toss your cares away 
 Leave your burdens on me 
 There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you 
 And I'll keep all the promises I have ever made 
 I am going to be with you 
 Here and everywhere 
 Do you know that you're not alone 
 And I will go ahead of you 
 What have you to fear 
 Do you know that you're not alone 
 You are not alone 
 Whoa no 
 I am always here 
 Yes I hear your prayer to me 
 And if you believe 
 That you can do anything 
 I will give you all the strength 
 Take you by the hand 
 And I'll lead you all the way 
 Toss your cares away 
 Leave your burdens on me 
 There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you 
 And I'll keep all the promises I have ever made 
 I am going to be with you 
 Here and everywhere 
 Do you know that you're not alone 
 And I will go ahead of you 
 What have you to fear 
 Do you know that you're not alone 
 You are not alone 
 Whoa no you are not alone (x3) 
 I am going to be with you 
 Here and everywhere 
 Do you know that you're not alone 
 And I will go ahead of you 
 What have you to fear 
 Do you know that you're not alone 
 You are not alone

I don't know if it's necessarily 
 (The things you do) 
 Maybe the things you say 
 Or maybe just the way you say it 
 It's true you sing a pretty song indeed 
 (In a new way) 
 You've said some things to me 
 But I'm not sure if you really mean it 
 Do you realize what you have done? 
 Do you think we have a problem? 
 You make me dance, you make me cry, you make me laugh 
 You make me shout, you make me smile, you make me mad 
 You make me sing, you make me think, you make me sad 
 You make me fall, you make me love, you make me mad 
 I don't see calling it a tragedy 
 (What you have done) 
 To do so would be wrong 
 And I think taking things too far 
 But I admit that in reality 
 (The truth be known) 
 I don't listen to words 
 But I know all of them by heart 
 Do you realize what you have done? 
 Do you think this is a problem? 
 You make me dance, you make me cry, you make me laugh 
 You make me shout, you make me smile, you make me mad 
 You make me sing, you make me think, you make me sad 
 You make me fall, you make me love, you make me mad 
 You make me mad, you make me mad 
 You make me dance, you make me cry, you make me laugh 
 You make me shout, you make me smile, you make me mad 
 You make me sing, you make me think, you make me sad 
 You make me fall, you make me love, you make me mad 
 You make me dance, you make me cry, you make me laugh 
 You make me shout, you make me smile, you make me mad 
 You make me sing, you make me think, you make me sad 
 You make me fall, you make me love, you make me mad

Like the rain that falls to the earth below 
 Watering the seed to grow 
 So it is with Your precious word, O Lord 
 It won't return until I know that 
 You're everywhere 
 You're everywhere 
 Like the wind that blows no one really knows 
 From where it comes or where it goes 
 So it is with Your Holy Spirit, Lord 
 Falling down on us to show that 
 (You're everywhere) Like the rain that's falling 
 (You're everywhere) Like the wind that's blowing 
 (You're everywhere) Like the sun upon my face 
 I feel the warmth in Your embrace 
 You are everywhere 
 My Lord, now I truly know 
 That I could never go from Your presence 
 My God, You are everywhere 
 From the lowest depths to the heavens 
 You're always there 
 (You're everywhere) Like the rain that's falling 
 (You're everywhere) Like the wind that's blowing 
 (You're everywhere) Like the sun upon my face 
 I feel the warmth in Your embrace 
 You are everywhere 
 (You're everywhere) Like the rain that's falling 
 (You're everywhere) Like the wind that's blowing 
 (You're everywhere) Like the sun upon my face 
 I feel the warmth in Your embrace 
 You are everywhere

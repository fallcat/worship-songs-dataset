"Ready?" 
 "Yeah." 
 Though the treasures of 
 This life may fade 
 Your love endures, forever 
 They will pass away 
 Things that man has made 
 But Your love endures forever 
 No I can't explain, 
 Or even understand 
 Why you gave your life, 
 To save sinful man 
 But I know it's true, 
 I've seen it myself 
 Your love endures forever 
 Though the seasons change 
 With the passing time 
 Your love endures forever 
 And the sun will fade 
 If just for the night 
 Your love endures forever 
 Though our pains and joys 
 Will come and go 
 Your love endures forever 
 Even in my fears 
 I will always know 
 That your love endures forever...

Your love is like a river flowing from my heart 
 Your love is like a river flowing from my heart 
 When this cruel world tears us apart 
 Your love is like a river flowing from my heart 
 When sharpened words have left their scars 
 Your love is like a river flowing from my heart 
 And it's overflowing and showing us all 
 How deep and how wide is Your love 
 It never stops, it rages on 
 Your love is like a river flowing from my heart 
 When I am tired and so afraid 
 Your love is like a fire that will light my way 
 When darkness falls and my vision fades 
 Your love is like a fire that will light my way 
 And it's always burning and stirring my soul 
 To know You and love You much more 
 It never stops or ever fades 
 Your love is like a fire that will light my way 
 It's never gonna stop 
 It's flowing from my heart 
 It's never gonna fade 
 Your love will light my way 
 When all my strength and hope is gone 
 Your love is like a rock that I am standing on 
 Your love is like a river flowing from my heart 
 Your love is like a fire that will light my way 
 Your love is like a rock that I am standing on 
 Your love is like a river flowing from my heart 
 Your love is like a fire that will light my way 
 Your love is like a rock that I am standing on 
 Your love is like a river flowing from my heart

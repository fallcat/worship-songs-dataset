Time album version, which is the same as on WOW Worship Yellow: 
 Your love, oh Lord 
 Reaches to the heavens 
 Your faithfulness 
 Stretches to the skies 
 Your righteousness is 
 Like the mighty mountain, yeah 
 Your justice flows like 
 The ocean's tides 
 I will lift my voice 
 To worship You, my King 
 I will find my strength 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 Your love, oh Lord 
 Reaches to the heavens 
 Your faithfulness 
 Stretches to the skies 
 Your righteousness is 
 Like the mighty mountain, yes 
 Your justice flows like the ocean's tides 
 I will lift my voice 
 To worship You, my King 
 And I will find my strength 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 I will lift my voice 
 To worship You, my King 
 And I will find my strength 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 I will lift my voice 
 To worship You, my King 
 And I will find my strength

 Reaches to the heavens 
 Your faithfulness 
 Stretches to the sky 
 Offering album version: 
 Spoken: 
 No, we did, we did not mean to mislead or to trick anybody 
 But, but I know most of you who have seen us in concert before 
 Know that when you came here tonight 
 You thought you were coming to a Third Day show 
 But hopefully you came with so much more than that 
 We come here tonight, and we all gather in the name of Jesus 
 We're going to have a church service here tonight, though 
 And it begins with praise to our Father 
 Your love, oh Lord 
 Reaches to the heavens 
 Your faithfulness stretches to the sky 
 And Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, yeah 
 Your justice flows like the ocean's tide 
 I will lift my voice 
 To worship You, my King 
 I will find my strength 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 Your love, oh Lord 
 Reaches to the heavens 
 Your faithfulness stretches to the sky 
 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, yes 
 Your justice flows like the ocean's tide 
 And I will lift my voice 
 To worship You, my King 
 And I will find my strength - spoken 
 And I will find my strength 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 Oh yeah 
 And I will lift my voice 
 To worship You, my King 
 And I will find my strength - spoken 
 And I will find my strength 
 In the shadow of Your wings - spoken 
 In the shadow of Your wings 
 And I will lift my voice - spoken 
 And I will lift my voice

 To worship You, my King

How great is your love, it never gives up on me 
 Stronger than shame, carries me back to you 
 Jesus my redeemer, 
 You have made a way 
 All glory to God who is able 
 All power and praise 
 Forever the earth will proclaim 
 You are mighty, you are mighty 
 So great is your love, keeps all its promises 
 Unshakeable, eternity rests in your hands 
 Jesus I surrender, lead me in your ways 
 All glory to God who is able 
 All power and praise 
 Forever the earth will proclaim 
 You are mighty, you are mighty 
 Lift him higher, he is mighty 
 Lift him higher, he is God 
 Lift him higher, he is mighty 
 Lift him higher, he is God

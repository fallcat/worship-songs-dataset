The rising Sun that fills the sky 
 The starry host that lights the night 
 Reflecing Your glory 
 The mountain heights, forever stand 
 The rain that falls to soak the land 
 Respond to Your glory 
 Almighty God, in every way 
 You are above and beyond understanding 
 If we did not praise, the rocks would cry out 
 Glorious God, high above understanding 
 The vast expanse of earth and sea 
 Held by You in harmony 
 Speaks of Your glory 
 All You've made, since time began 
 Life itself, Your perfect plan 
 And it's all for You glory 
 Creation joins as one to sing 
 "Glorious God." 
 So far about all earthly things

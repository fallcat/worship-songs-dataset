Empty handed here I come 
 I've nothing left to give You 
 Take my heart and all I am 
 Who else Lord can I run to? 
 Every part of me You see 
 I'm an open book before You 
 Jesus take me as I am 
 I can come no other way 
 Your arms are big enough for me 
 Your arms are big enough for me 
 Years of pain are washed away 
 In the beauty of Your presence 
 In this moment, everyday 
 Perfect love will carry me 
 Your arms are big enough for me, Jesus 
 Your arms are big enough for me 
 Your grace is strong enough for me 
 Yes, Your grace is strong enough for me 
 I lay my life down here 
 I give it all to You 
 It's all for You 
 Nothing can keep me from Your love 
 Oh the love of Jesus 
 I lay my life down here 
 I give it all to You 
 It's all for You 
 Nothing can keep me from Your love 
 Oh the love of Jesus 
 Your arms are big enough for me 
 Your arms are big enough for me

At your name, the mountains shake and crumble, 
 At your name, the oceans roll and tumble 
 At your name, angels will bow, the earth will rejoice, your people cry out 
 Lord of all the earth we'll shout your name, shout your name 
 Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise 
 Yahweh Yahweh, we love to shout your name oh Lord 
 At your name, the morning breaks in glory, 
 At your name, creation sings your story, 
 At your name, angels will bow, the earth will rejoice, your people cry out 
 Forever I will love You 
 Always I will love You 
 Forever I will love You 
 You have won my heart 
 Forever I will love You 
 Always I will love You 
 Forever I will love You 
 You have won my heart 
 Forever I will love You 
 Always I will love You 
 Forever I will love You 
 You have won my heart 
 You have won my heart 
 I will sing for You 
 Oh, sing, I will sing, I will sing

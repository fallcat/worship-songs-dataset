Wonderful, so wonderful, is Your unfailing love 
 Your cross has spoken mercy over me 
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no heart could fully know 
 How glorious, how beautiful You are 
 Beautiful One I love You 
 Beautiful One I adore 
 Beautiful One, my soul must sing 
 Powerful, so powerful, Your glory fills the skies 
 Your mighty works displayed for all to see 
 The beauty of Your majesty awakes my heart to sing 
 How marvelous, how wonderful You are 
 Beautiful One I love You 
 Beautiful One I adore 
 Beautiful One, my soul must sing 
 Beautiful One I love You

 Beautiful One, my soul must sing 
 You've opened my hearts to wonders anew 
 You've captured my heart with this love 
 'Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as You

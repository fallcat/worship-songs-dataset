Your voice has stilled the raging storms 
 The wind and waves bow down before 
 Your still small voice brings hope to all 
 Who wait on You, we'll wait for You 
 To lead us to the place where You'll restore our souls 
 And all our earthly strivings come to cease 
 Take from our souls the strain and stress 
 And let our ordered lives confess 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 La laâ€¦.. 
 Bright skies will soon be overhead 
 We'll enter in to Heaven's rest 
 There'll be no death, there'll be no pain 
 The things of old will pass away 
 You'll lead us to the place where You'll restore our souls 
 And all our earthly strivings come to cease 
 Take from our souls the strain and stress 
 And let our ordered lives confess 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 Lead us to the place where You'll restore our souls 
 And all our earthly strivings come to cease 
 Take from our souls the strain and stress 
 And let our ordered lives confess 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 Take from our souls the strain and stress 
 And let our ordered lives confess 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 The beauty of Your peace 
 La la...

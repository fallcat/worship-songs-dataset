There's a place where the streets shine 
 With the glory of the Lamb 
 There's a way we can go there 
 We can live there, be on time 
 Because of You, because of You 
 Because of Your love, because of Your blood 
 No more pain no more sadness 
 No more suffering, no more tears 
 No more sin, no more sickness 
 No injustice, no more death 
 Because of You, because of You 
 Because of Your love, because of Your blood 
 Oh, our sins are washed away 
 And we can live forever 
 Now we have this hope 
 Because of You 
 Oh, we'll see You face to face 
 And we'll dance together 
 In the city of our God 
 Because of You 
 True, true, true 
 There'll be joy everlasting 
 There'll be gladness, there'll be peace 
 There'll be wine ever flowing 
 There's a wedding, there's a feast 
 Because of You, because of You 
 Because of Your love, because of Your blood 
 Oh, our sins are washed away 
 And we can live forever 
 Now we have this hope 
 Because of You 
 Oh, we'll see You face to face 
 And we'll dance together 
 In the city of our God 
 Because of You 
 Oh, our sins are washed away 
 And we can live forever 
 Now we have this hope 
 Because of You 
 Oh, we'll see You face to face 
 And we'll dance together 
 In the city of our God 
 Because of You 
 There's a place where the streets shine 
 With the glory of the Lamb 
 There's a way we can go there 
 We can live there be on time 
 No more pain no more sadness 
 No more suffering, no more tears 
 No more sin, no more sickness 
 No injustice, no more death 
 There is joy everlasting 
 There is gladness, there is peace 
 There'll be wine ever flowing 
 There's a wedding, there's a feast

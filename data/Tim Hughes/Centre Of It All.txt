In the beginning 
 Before You set the world in motion 
 Uncreated God eternal 
 Radiant beauty 
 Infinite, the God head three in one 
 Perfect Father, Spirit, Savior 
 And it all begins and ends with You 
 It all begins and ends with You 
 The first the last the center of it all 
 And in You all things are held together 
 The sun the moon the stars the heavens 
 Creator God, the center of it all 
 All of the Universe explodes in song before designer King 
 Valley shaper, mountain maker 
 The stars sing out, they can't contain the praises of their God 
 Earth creator, heaven shaker 
 Beginning of it all 
 The reason for it all 
 The centre of it all

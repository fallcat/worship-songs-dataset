My soul is weak 
 My heart is numb 
 I cannot see 
 But still my hope is found in You 
 I'll hold on tightly 
 You will never let me go 
 For Jesus, You will never fail 
 Jesus, You will never fail 
 Simply to the cross I cling 
 Letting go of all earthly things 
 Clinging to the cross 
 Mercy's found a way for me 
 Hope is here as I am free 
 Jesus, You are all I need 
 Clinging to the cross 
 Even darkness is as light to You 
 So light the way and lead me home 
 To that place where every tear is wiped away 
 For Jesus, You will never fail 
 Jesus, You will never fail 
 What a Saviour, what a story 
 You were crucified but now you are alive 
 So amazing, such a mystery 
 You were crucified but now you are alive!

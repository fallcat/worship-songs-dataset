There must be more than this 
 O, breath of God, come breathe within 
 There must be more than this 
 O, breath of God, come breathe within 
 There must be more than this 
 Spirit of God, we wait for You 
 Fill us anew we pray 
 Fill us anew we pray 
 Consuming fire, fan into flames 
 A passion for Your name 
 Spirit of God, would You fall in this place 
 Lord, have Your way 
 Lord have Your way with us 
 Come like a rushing wind 
 Clothe us with power from on high 
 Now set the captives free 
 Leave us abandoned to Your praise 
 Lord, let Your glory fall 
 Lord, let Your glory fall 
 Consuming fire, fan into flames 
 A passion for Your name 
 Spirit of God, would You fall in this place 
 Lord, have Your way 
 Lord have Your way with us 
 O there must be more 
 There must be more 
 There must be more 
 There must be more 
 Consuming fire, fan into flames 
 A passion for Your name 
 Spirit of God, would You fall in this place 
 Lord, have Your way 
 Lord have Your way with us 
 Stir it up in our hearts, Lord 
 Stir it up in our hearts, Lord 
 Stir it up in our hearts, a passion for Your name 
 Stir it up in our hearts, Lord 
 Stir it up in our hearts, Lord 
 Stir it up in our hearts, a passion for Your name 
 Stir it up in our hearts, Lord 
 Stir it up in our hearts, Lord 
 Stir it up in our hearts, a passion for Your name 
 Oh 
 Fan into flame, a passion for Your name 
 A passion for Your name (a passion for Your name) 
 Lord, have Your way 
 Fan into flame, a passion for Your name

 Gonna shout, shout 
 Everybody shout now 
 Your grace is overwhelming 
 Your joy is in my heart 
 Your goodness lasts forevermore 
 Everybody sing

 Everybody dance now 
 Your love is all consuming 
 Your song is in my heart 
 You've changed this life forevermore 
 Everybody sing 
 Jump, jump

 Gonna jump, jump 
 Everybody jump now

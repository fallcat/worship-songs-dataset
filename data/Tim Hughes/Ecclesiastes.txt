There's a time for tears 
 And a time to dance 
 There's a time to let go 
 And a time for romance 
 There's a time for war 
 And a time for peace 
 There's a time to embrace 
 And a time to release 
 Oh my Lord I need to find 
 Take my hand and I will follow 
 There's a time for love 
 And a time to hate 
 All the evil choices that we make 
 There's a time to rise 
 And a time to fall 
 It's a time to keep 
 Or just throw at all 
 Your love in every breathe I take 
 In every step I make 
 Your love will shine on me

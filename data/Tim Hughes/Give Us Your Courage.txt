I'm not backing down 
 I will stand my ground 
 Lifting high he name of Jesus 
 Holding out Your light 
 To a world in need 
 Living out the love of Jesus 
 And though the battles rage 
 Your blessing still will come 
 To the ends of the earth we will go 
 Fill us with power 
 For the truth of Your word we will stand 
 Give us Your corage 
 Be our strength and song 
 Till the battles won 
 Cause Your face to shine upon us 
 Stretch Your hand to save 
 Our God never fails 
 Nothing is impossible for You 
 Would You breathe on us

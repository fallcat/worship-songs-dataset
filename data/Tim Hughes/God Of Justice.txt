God of Justice, Saviour to all 
 Came to rescue the weak and the poor 
 Chose to serve and not be served 
 Jesus, You have called us 
 Freely we've received 
 Now freely we will give 
 We must go live to feed the hungry 
 Stand beside the broken 
 We must go 
 Stepping forward keep us from just singing 
 Move us into action 
 We must go 
 To act justly everyday 
 Loving mercy in everyway 
 Walking humbly before You God 
 You have shown us, what You require 
 Freely we've received 
 Now freely we will give 
 We must go live to feed the hungry 
 Stand beside the broken 
 We must go 
 Stepping forward keep us from just singing 
 Move us into action 
 We must go 
 Fill us up and send us out 
 Fill us up and send us out 
 Fill us up and send us out Lord (x4) 
 Acting humbly 
 Loving mercy 
 We must go, we must go 
 To the broken 
 And the hurting 
 We must go, we must go 
 We must go live to feed the hungry 
 Stand beside the broken 
 We must go 
 Stepping forward keep us from just singing 
 Move us into action 
 We must go

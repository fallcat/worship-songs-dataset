Though my feet may fall 
 And the way seems unsure 
 When my best falls short 
 Still I'll sing You are Lord 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah 
 When all the waters have run dry 
 You alone still satisfy 
 I won't be thirsty in Your courts 
 So I will sing You are Lord 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah 
 Through it all You remain 
 When all else fails You're the same 
 Faithful God, Friend and King 
 I will sing, always sing 
 Through it all You remain 
 When all else fails You're the same 
 Faithful God, Friend and King 
 I will sing, always sing 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah 
 When the darkness closes in 
 And I've nothing left to bring 
 Questions waiting at the door 
 Still I'll sing for You are Lord 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah 
 Halle, halle, hallelujah

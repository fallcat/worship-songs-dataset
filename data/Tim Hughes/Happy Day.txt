The greatest day in history 
 Death is beaten, you have rescued me 
 Sing it out Jesus is alive 
 The empty cross, The empty grave 
 Life eternal You have won the day 
 Shout it out, Jesus is alive 
 He's alive 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 You washed my sin away 
 Oh happy day, happy day 
 I'll never be the same 
 Forever I am changed 
 When I stand, in that place 
 Free at last, meeting face to face 
 I am Yours Jesus You are mine 
 Endless joy, perfect peace 
 Earthly pain finally will cease 
 Celebrate, Jesus is alive 
 He's alive 
 Oh what a glorious day 
 What a glorious way 
 That You have saved me 
 Oh what a glorious day 
 What a glorious name

Here I am, and I have come 
 To thank You, Lord, for all You've done 
 Thank You Lord 
 You paid the price, at Calvary 
 You shed Your blood, You set me free 
 Thank You Lord 
 No greater love, was ever shown 
 No better life, ever was laid down 
 And I will always love Your name 
 And I will always sing Your praise 
 And I will always love Your name 
 And I will always sing Your praise 
 You took my sin, You took my shame 
 You drank my cup, You bore my pain, 
 Thank You Lord 
 You broke the curse, You broke the chains 
 In victory, from death You rose again! 
 Thank You Lord 
 And not by works but by Your grace 
 You clothe me now in Your righteousness 
 And I will always love Your name 
 And I will always sing Your praise 
 And I will always love Your name 
 And I will always sing Your praise 
 You bid me come, You make me whole 
 You give me peace, You restore my soul, 
 Thank you Lord 
 You fill me up and when I'm full 
 You give me more till I overflow 
 Thank You Lord 
 You're making me to be like You 
 To do the works of the Father too 
 And I...

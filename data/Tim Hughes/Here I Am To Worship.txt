Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness 
 Opened my eyes, let me see 
 Beauty that made this heart adore You 
 Hope of a life spent with You 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 King of all days, 
 Oh, so highly exalted 
 Glorious in heaven above 
 Humbly You came to the earth You created 
 All for love's sake became poor 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 And here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 I'll never know how much it cost 
 To see my sin upon that cross 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy (wonderful) 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 And here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 You are together worthy 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me 
 Here I am to worship 
 Here I am to bow down 
 Here I am to say that You're my God 
 You're altogether lovely 
 Altogether worthy 
 Altogether wonderful to me

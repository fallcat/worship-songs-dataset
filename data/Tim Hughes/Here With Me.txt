When darkness deepens 
 The path unsure 
 The sun is hidden by the storms 
 I look to heaven 
 And cry to Thee 
 Oh God be here with me 
 When darkness deepens 
 The path unsure 
 The sun is hidden by the storms 
 I look to heaven 
 And cry to Thee 
 Oh God be here with me 
 In every breath 
 Every joy and tear 
 Every passing hour 
 Let me know You're near 
 In life, in death 
 For eternity 
 Oh God be here with me 
 When faith is shaken 
 When fears surround 
 My feet will stand on solid ground 
 In every season 
 My song will be 
 Oh God be here with me 
 In every breath 
 Every joy and tear 
 Every passing hour 
 Let me know You're near 
 In life, in death 
 For eternity 
 Oh God be here with me 
 And in that moment 
 We're face to face 
 I will not need these eyes of faith 
 Forever after, God I will see 
 That You've always been with me 
 You've always been with me 
 In every breath 
 Every joy and tear 
 Every passing hour 
 Let me know You're near 
 In life, in death 
 For eternity 
 Oh God you are here with me 
 In every breath 
 Every joy and tear 
 Every passing hour 
 Let me know You're near 
 In life, in death 
 For eternity 
 Oh God you are here with me 
 Oh God you are here with me

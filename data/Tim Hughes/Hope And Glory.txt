Hear our cry, oh King of heaven 
 Jesus hope to every heart 
 We are lost without Your glory 
 We are lost without You God 
 Be the fire, that burns within us 
 Flames of love that purify 
 Send Your power and Your salvation 
 Let us see Your Kingdom come 
 Only You can move the mountain 
 Only You can heal our land 
 Christ alone, our hope and glory 
 Christ alone in You we stand 
 Turn Your eyes and show us mercy 
 How we need Your Father's love 
 Lead us home, and out of darkness 
 With Your gospel, burning bright 
 'Cause only You can move the mountain 
 Only You can heal our land 
 Christ alone, our hope and glory 
 Christ alone in You we stand 
 Only You can move the mountain 
 Only You can heal our land 
 Christ alone, our hope and glory 
 Christ alone in You we stand 
 We believe our God is mighty 
 We believe our God is here 
 We believe our King is coming 
 Christ alone in You we stand 
 Praise the Lord, our God is mighty 
 Praise the Lord, our God is here 
 Praise the Lord, our King is coming 
 Christ alone in You we stand 
 'Cause only You can move the mountain 
 Only You can heal our land 
 Christ alone, our hope and glory 
 Christ alone in You we stand 
 Christ alone in You we stand

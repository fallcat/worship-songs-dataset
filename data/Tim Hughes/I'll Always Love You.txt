Yeah, yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 I just want to love 
 I just want to sing 
 To the One above 
 Who has touched this thirsty soul 
 I just want to love 
 I just want to sing 
 To the One above 
 Who has touched this thirsty soul 
 And now I'll never be the same 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus 
 I long to worship You in Spirit and in truth 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus 
 I long to worship You in Spirit and in truth 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Everyday I'll come 
 Spend my life with You 
 Learning of Your heart 
 And what You're calling me to do 
 Everyday I'll come 
 Spend my life with You 
 Learning of Your heart 
 And what You're calling me to do 
 My every breath belongs to You 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus 
 I long to worship You in Spirit and in truth 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus 
 I long to worship You in Spirit and in truth 
 And with this song 
 We'll lift the name of Jesus higher 
 And with a shout 
 We'll raise up one voice 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus 
 I long to worship You in Spirit and in truth 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always love You 
 I'll always sing to You, Jesus 
 I long to worship You in Spirit and in truth 
 We worship You, Lord 
 We worship You, oh

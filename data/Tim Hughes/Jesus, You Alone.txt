Jesus, You alone shall be my first love 
 My first love 
 The secret place and highest praise shall be Yours 
 Shall be Yours. 
 To Your throne I'll bring devotion 
 May it be the sweetest sound 
 Lord, this heart is reaching for You now 
 So I'll set my sights upon You 
 Set my life upon Your praise 
 Never looking to another way 
 Day and night I'll lift my eyes to seek You 
 To seek You 
 Hungry for a glimpse of You in glory 
 In glory 
 To Your throne I'll bring devotion 
 May it be the sweetest sound 
 Lord, this heart is reaching for You now, yeah, yeah 
 So I'll set my sights upon You 
 Set my life upon Your praise 
 Never looking to another way 
 Father, You alone will be my passion 
 And Jesus, You will be my song 
 You will find me longing after You 
 To Your throne I'll bring devotion 
 May it be the sweetest sound 
 Lord, this heart is reaching for You now 
 And to Your throne I'll bring devotion 
 May it be the sweetest sound 
 Lord, this heart is reaching for You now 
 So I'll set my sights upon You 
 Set my life upon Your praise 
 Never looking to another way 
 These eyes are on you 
 You alone will be my passion 
 And Jesus, You will be my song 
 You will find me longing after You 
 You alone will be my passion 
 And Jesus, You will be my song 
 You will find me longing after You 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Longing after You 
 Longing after You

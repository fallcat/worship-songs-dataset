I'm laying out all the pieces of my life 
 On the altar I'm your sacrifice 
 Let your fire fall, I'm waiting here 
 Come and take it all, this heart of fear 
 All I want is to do my fathers will 
 And be a voice to a world that's standing still 
 I must the keep the faith, not backing down 
 We must keep the faith, this is our time. 
 We will overcome 
 When you are with us we are strong 
 And Love will be our greatest song 
 We'll keep the faith and stand forever. 
 If not us who will shout your song of praise 
 For every soul to be saved in Jesus name 
 So we must keep the faith, not backing down 
 And we must live this faith, this is our time. 
 We will overcome 
 When you are with us we are strong 
 And Love will be our greatest song 
 We'll keep the faith and stand forever. 
 We believe in God Almighty 
 We believe in you 
 We will trust in God Almighty 
 We will trust in you 
 We believe in God Almighty 
 We believe in you 
 We will trust in God Almighty 
 We will trust in you 
 We will overcome 
 When you are with us we are strong 
 And Love will be our greatest song 
 We'll keep the faith and stand forever. 
 We will overcome 
 When you are with us we are strong 
 And Love will be our greatest song 
 We'll keep the faith and stand forever. 
 We'll keep the faith 
 And stand forever 
 We'll live the faith 
 And stand forever

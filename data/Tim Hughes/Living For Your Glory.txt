What good is it to gain the whole world, but lose your soul? 
 What good is it to make a sweet sound, but remain proud? 
 In view of God's mercy, I offer my all 
 And take my life, let it be everything, all of me 
 Here I am, use me for Your glory 
 In everything I say and do, let my life honor You 
 Here I am living for Your glory 
 The road I'm on that leads nowhere without You 
 And the life I live that finds meaning and surrender 
 In view of God's mercy, I offer my all 
 Seeking first the Kingdom 
 Seeking first the Kingdom of my Lord

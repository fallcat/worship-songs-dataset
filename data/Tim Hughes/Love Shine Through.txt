Love shine through 
 All the pain I feel 
 In my darkest hour 
 I am weak but You are strong 
 Holding on 
 Don't let me go 
 In Your light I will follow 
 Christ within me shine 
 In Your light I will follow 
 Christ within me shine 
 And here I stand 
 Everything is Yours Lord 
 All I am 
 Humbled by Your love 
 Take Your place 
 Jesus be the centre 
 I'm nothing without You 
 God shine through 
 Every hope and prayer 
 And my heart it aches 
 To be one with you my Lord 
 Wake my soul 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 In Your light I will follow 
 Christ within me shine 
 In Your light I will follow 
 Christ within me shine 
 And here I stand 
 Everything is Yours Lord 
 All I am 
 Humbled by Your love 
 Take Your place 
 Jesus be the centre 
 I'm nothing without You 
 God shine through 
 Every hope and prayer 
 And my heart it aches 
 To be one with you my Lord 
 Wake my soul 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 Cause Your face to shine upon us 
 Lord arise and shine 
 Cause Your face to shine upon us 
 Lord arise and shine 
 Let it shine 
 Let it shine 
 Let it shine 
 Let it shine 
 Let it shine 
 (Let it shine let it shine...) 
 And here I stand 
 Everything is Yours Lord 
 All I am 
 Humbled by Your love 
 Take Your place 
 Jesus be the centre 
 I'm nothing without You 
 God shine through 
 Every hope and prayer 
 And my heart it aches 
 To be one with you my Lord 
 Wake my soul 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 And here I stand 
 Everything is Yours Lord 
 All I am 
 Humbled by Your love 
 Take Your place 
 Jesus be the centre 
 I'm nothing without You 
 God shine through 
 Every hope and prayer 
 And my heart it aches 
 To be one with you my Lord 
 Wake my soul 
 Let Your kingdom come 
 God shine through, Lord shine through, may Your love shine through 
 (Let it shine let it shine...)

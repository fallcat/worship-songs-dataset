May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart 
 Bless Your name, bless Your name, Jesus 
 And the deeds of the day and the truth in my ways 
 Speak of You, speak of You, Jesus 
 For this is what I'm glad to do 
 It's time to live a life of love that pleases You 
 And I will give my all to You 
 Surrender everything I have and follow You 
 I'll follow You 
 Lord, will You be my vision, 
 Lord, will You be my guide 
 Be my hope, be my light and the way 
 And I'll look not for riches, nor praises on earth 
 Only You'll be the first of my heart 
 For this is what I'm glad to do 
 It's time to live a life of love that pleases You 
 And I will give my all to You 
 Surrender everything I have and follow You 
 I'll follow You 
 I will follow, 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow, 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow, 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow, 
 I will follow You 
 For this is what I'm glad to do 
 It's time to live a life of love that pleases You 
 And I will give my all to You 
 Surrender everything I have and follow You 
 For this is what I'm glad to do 
 It's time to live a life of love that pleases You 
 And I will give my all to You 
 Surrender everything I have and follow You 
 I'll follow You 
 I will follow, 
 I will follow You, Jesus 
 I will follow, 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow, 
 I will follow You 
 I will take up my cross, boy 
 I will follow 
 Will You be my vision 
 You as my guide 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow You 
 I will follow You

La la laâ€¦. 
 My Jesus, my lifeline 
 I need You more than 
 I've ever known 
 There's no one quite like You 
 I'm crying out for Your loving 
 Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus 
 I've never known a love like this before 
 Oh, Jesus, sweet Jesus 
 Accept this love I give to You 
 It's all I can do 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I'm searching, I'm longing 
 Please meet me just as You want to 
 I'll stand here to offer 
 Offer up this song of love to You 
 Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus 
 I've never known a love like this before 
 Oh, Jesus, sweet Jesus 
 Accept this love I give to You 
 Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus 
 I've never known a love like this before 
 Oh, Jesus, sweet Jesus 
 Accept this love I give to You 
 It's all I can do 
 Jesus 
 My lifeline 
 My lifeline 
 My Savior 
 Jesus 
 You will always be

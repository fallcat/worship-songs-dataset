Lord, this heart must sing of all that You have done for me 
 The beauty of the cross, the greatness of Your loss 
 So I'll thank You for the day 
 When You washed my sin away 
 I will never lose the wonder 
 Of the blood You shed for me 
 There could be no greater love than this 
 Through all eternity 
 So I'll thank You for the day 
 When You washed my sin away 
 Washed it away 
 Help  me understand just what it meant for You, Jesus 
 The holy King of all upon a sinner's cross 
 So I'll thank You for the day 
 When You washed my sin away 
 I will never lose the wonder 
 Of the blood You shed for me 
 There could be no greater love than this 
 Through all eternity 
 I will never lose the wonder 
 Of the blood You shed for me 
 There could be no greater love than this 
 Through all eternity 
 So I'll thank You for the day 
 When You washed my sin away 
 Never lose the wonder, oh 
 The beauty of the cross 
 The greatness of Your grace 
 I will never lose the wonder 
 Of the blood You shed for me 
 There could be no greater love than this 
 Through all eternity 
 So I'll thank You for the day 
 When You washed my sin away 
 Yes, I'll thank You for the day 
 When You washed my sin away

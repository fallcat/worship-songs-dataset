Into this broken world You came, a ray of light 
 Into this broken world You came 
 The way of love is here, You've come to my rescue 
 So glad that I've found You, You've come to give life to all 
 Once and for all the price is paid, we can't stop singing 
 Amazing love has won the day, we'll never stop singing 
 We'll shout it out, we'll live it loud, we can't stop singing 
 We'll never stop singing Your praise 
 In You the best is yet to come, a brighter day 
 In You the best is yet to come 
 The King of love is here, You've come to my rescue 
 So glad that I've found You, You've come to give life to all 
 Once and for all the price is paid, we can't stop singing 
 Amazing love has won the day, we'll never stop singing 
 We'll shout it out, we'll live it loud, we can't stop singing 
 We'll never stop singing Your praise 
 We'll never stop singing Your praise 
 We'll never stop singing Your praise 
 We won't stop, we won't stop 
 We won't stop singing Your praise 
 We can't stop, we can't stop 
 We can't stop singing Your praise 
 We won't stop, we won't stop 
 We won't stop singing Your praise 
 We can't stop, oh 
 Once and for all the price is paid, we can't stop singing 
 Amazing love has won the day, we'll never stop singing 
 We'll shout it out, we'll live it loud, we can't stop singing 
 We'll never stop singing Your praise 
 We'll never stop singing Your praise 
 We won't stop, we won't stop 
 We won't stop singing Your praise

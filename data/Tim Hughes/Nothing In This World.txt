Nothing in this world, no treasure man could buy 
 Could take the place of drawing near to You 
 There's nothing I want more than to spend my days with You 
 Dwelling in Your secret place of praise 
 And oh, how I need You 
 Jesus, I need You 
 You are the One who satisfies 
 You are the One who satisfies 
 So place within my heart a fire that burns for You 
 That waters cannot quench nor wash away 
 And let that fire blaze through all eternity 
 Where one day I shall see You face to face 
 Keep me 
 And oh, how I need You 
 Lord Jesus, I need You 
 You are the One who satisfies 
 You are the One who satisfies 
 Oh, how I need You 
 And oh, oh, how I need You 
 I need You, My Jesus 
 I need You 
 You are the One who satisfies 
 You are the One who satisfies 
 Jesus, the One who satisfies 
 Savior, the One who satisfies

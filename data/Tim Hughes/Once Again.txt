Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice 
 You became nothing, poured out to death 
 Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life 
 And I'm in that place once again 
 I'm in that place once again 
 And once again I look upon the cross where You died 
 I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside 
 Once again I thank You 
 Once again I pour out my life 
 Now You are exalted to the highest place 
 King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow 
 But for now I marvel at Your saving grace 
 And I'm full of praise once again 
 I'm full of praise once again 
 Thank You for the cross 
 Thank You for the cross 
 Thank you for the cross, my friend

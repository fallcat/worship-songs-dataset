This is the moment 
 This is why I'm living 
 To face the giants with You 
 It's now or never 
 And though my heart is racing 
 I'll leave my armor with You 
 Your love makes us stronger 
 Your love sees us through 
 Only the brave will go where You go 
 Into the fire but never alone 
 We know You'll always carry us home 
 Only the brave will go where You go 
 It's all or nothing 
 These scars will tell a story 
 Of how Your power broke through 
 In every battle 
 Our God is never shaken 
 Our hope will always be You 
 Your love makes us stronger 
 Your love sees us through 
 Your love is forever 
 I'm Yours, I'm with You 
 Only the brave will go where You go 
 Into the fire but never alone 
 We know You'll always carry us home 
 Only the brave will go where You go 
 We're gonna go where You go 
 We're gonna go where You go 
 We're gonna go where You go 
 Only the brave will go where You go 
 Into the fire but never alone 
 We know You'll always carry us home 
 Only the brave 
 Only the brave will go where You go 
 Into the fire but never alone 
 We know You'll always carry us home 
 Only the brave will go where You go 
 We're gonna go where You go 
 We're gonna go where You go 
 We're gonna go where You go

I could live a thousand years 
 Never earn a moment of Your grace 
 Even in my darkest day 
 You shine on me 
 You shine on me 
 And out of the darkness 
 You brought me into Your glorious light 
 Saved from the death I was facing 
 Rejoicing in the future, a hope that is mine 
 The greatest of all gifts 
 From the greatest of all givers 
 Jesus there upon the cross 
 True love displayed for all to see 
 And your grace runs after me 
 Runs after me 
 Everyday of my life 
 And your mercies they never fail 
 They never fail 
 Everyday of my life

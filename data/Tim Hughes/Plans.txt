From the breaking of the daylight 
 Help us see the world through Your eyes 
 Finding beauty in the broken 
 Trusting promises You've spoken 
 You've got plans to give us 
 A future and a hope 
 We are not forgotten 
 We are not alone 
 Plans to lead us home into Your heart 
 You are always with us 
 Everywhere we are 
 You stay loyal for a lifetime 
 Through the shadows and the sunlight 
 When our worries overtake us 
 We believe that they won't break us 
 You've got plans to give us 
 A future and a hope 
 We are not forgotten 
 We are not alone 
 Plans to lead us home into Your heart 
 You are always with us 
 Everywhere we are 
 On and on Your love will never stop 
 Shining down upon us 
 Never letting up 
 On and on Your love will see us through 
 Even in the shadows 
 We will trust in You 
 You've got plans to give us 
 A future and a hope 
 We are not forgotten 
 We are not alone 
 Plans to lead us home into Your heart 
 You are always with us 
 Everywhere we are 
 You've got plans to give us 
 A future and a hope 
 We are not forgotten 
 We are not alone 
 Plans to lead us home into Your heart 
 You are always with us 
 Everywhere we are 
 On and on Your love will never stop 
 Shining down upon us 
 Never letting up 
 On and on Your love will see us through 
 Even in the shadows 
 We will trust in You

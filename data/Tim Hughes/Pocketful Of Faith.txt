I don't want to get there 
 At the end of it all 
 Looking behind me 
 To see there was so much more 
 Take this pocketful of faith 
 It is all I have today 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 You will always have my heart 
 Everyday I'll trust You more, oh God 
 Take this pocketful of faith 
 It is all I have today 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 Leaving the safety 
 Here at the shore 
 Beyond the horizon 
 I see there is so much more 
 Take this pocketful of faith 
 It is all I have today 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 You will always have my heart 
 Everyday I'll trust You more, oh God 
 Take this pocketful of faith 
 It is all I have today 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 Anywhere You go I'll follow 
 When You call my name I'll run 
 Lead me on into tomorrow 
 Light my way like the rising sun 
 Anywhere You go I'll follow 
 When You call my name I'll run 
 Lead me on into tomorrow 
 Light my way like the rising sun 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 I'm giving it all 
 Anywhere You go I'll follow 
 When You call my name I'll run 
 Lead me on into tomorrow 
 Light my way like the rising sun 
 Anywhere You go I'll follow 
 When You call my name I'll run 
 Lead me on into tomorrow 
 Light my way like the rising sun 
 I'm giving it all...

I'll remember you 
 I'll remember what you did 
 Remembering the cross 
 Remembering the price you paid 
 I'll remember you 
 No one's ever loved me quite like you do 
 No one's ever love me quite like you 
 Jesus for your glory I will tell the story of the cross 
 I will sing of you 
 I will sing of what you did 
 The stone lies rolled away 
 Nothing but an empty grave 
 I will sing of you 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah for the cross

This is Jesus, light of life eternal, Flesh and bones 
 Descending, you walked upon the earth 
 The creator, humbled by creation You kissed the world 
 In mercy and graced us at the cross 
 Sing aloud the Saviour's song, come worship him, come worship him 
 Raise your hands and shout his name, Christ Jesus, Christ Jesus 
 It is finished, a rugged cross stands empty 
 Death has been defeated this world is not the same 
 Suns arising, awe and adoration 
 Fill our hearts with wonder, endless praise is yours 
 For nothing is higher, no one is greater, nothing compares to you 
 For nothing is higher, no one is greater, nothing compares to you

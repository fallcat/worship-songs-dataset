Back to our first love, nothing between us 
 Back to Your heart, to the start of it all 
 Where we found You 
 Out of the ashes, into the fire 
 You are refining our hearts in the flames 
 Of Your presence 
 Set apart for our God above 
 Set apart for the One we love 
 Set apart for Your glory 
 We are Yours, Yours 
 Sacred and holy, Your name is worthy 
 Jesus, awaken our hearts now to be 
 Your revival 
 Set apart for our God above 
 Set apart for the One we love 
 Set apart for Your glory 
 We are Yours, Yours 
 Everything for You alone 
 Everything to make You known 
 Set apart for Your glory 
 We are Yours, Yours 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Oh, how great You are 
 Set apart for our God above 
 Set apart for the One we love 
 Set apart for Your glory 
 We are Yours, Yours 
 Everything for You alone 
 Everything to make You known 
 Set apart for Your glory 
 We are Yours, Yours

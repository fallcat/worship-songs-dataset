Your love high above the galaxies 
 Your arms reaching out and holding me 
 All this, all this amazes me 
 You stand sovereign over earth and sea 
 You speak right into the depths of me 
 All this, all this amazes me 
 Your love is sky high 
 Reaching to the heavens 
 And is so wide 
 Reaching even me 
 God Your love goes on forever 
 God Your love my everything 
 You reign, endless in Your majesty 
 You're here, closer than the air I breathe 
 All this, all this amazes me 
 Your love is sky high 
 Reaching to the heavens 
 And is so wide 
 Reaching even me 
 God Your love goes on forever 
 God Your love my everything 
 Nothing could separate 
 Nothing could keep me from Your heart 
 Keep me from Your heart 
 Whatever comes my way 
 Nothing could keep me from Your heart 
 Keep me from Your heart 
 Your love is sky high 
 Reaching to the heavens 
 And is so wide 
 Reaching even me 
 God Your love goes on forever 
 God Your love my everything 
 Your love is sky high 
 Reaching to the heavens 
 And is so wide 
 Reaching even me 
 God Your love goes on forever 
 God Your love my everything 
 Yes, God Your love goes on forever 
 God Your love my everything 
 Holy are You Lord...

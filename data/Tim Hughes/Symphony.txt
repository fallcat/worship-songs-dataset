Kindness will lead us to freedom 
 Safe from the weight of the world 
 If glory is grace You've perfected 
 Then grace, have Your way in me 
 You restore my soul 
 You're breathing Your life into me 
 You restore my soul 
 And Your love won 
 We come alive in Your Son 
 Raised to the heights 
 Love like no other, a symphony 
 You're singing over me 
 Lifted from failure to promise 
 Rescued from burden to peace 
 You call for this wanderer to follow 
 And gave me a new song to sing 
 You restore my soul 
 You're breathing Your life into me 
 You restore my soul 
 And Your love won 
 We come alive in Your Son 
 Raised to the heights 
 Love like no other, a symphony 
 You're singing over me 
 And Your love won 
 We come alive in Your Son 
 Raised to the heights 
 Love like no other, a symphony 
 You're singing over me 
 Songs of freedom 
 Songs of healing 
 You're for me 
 You are for me 
 Every promise 
 Never failing 
 You're for me 
 You are for me 
 And Your love won 
 We come alive in Your Son 
 Raised to the heights 
 Love like no other, a symphony 
 You're singing over me 
 Love won 
 We come alive in Your Son 
 Raised to the heights 
 Love like no other, a symphony 
 You're singing over me 
 Love like no other, a symphony 
 You're singing over me

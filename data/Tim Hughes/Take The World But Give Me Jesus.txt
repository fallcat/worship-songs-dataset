I've thrown it all away 
 That I might gain a life in You 
 I've found all else is loss 
 Compared to the joys of knowing You 
 Your beauty and Your majesty are far beyond compare 
 You've won my heart, now this will be my prayer 
 "Take the world but give me Jesus" - 
 You're the treasure in this life 
 "Take the world but give me Jesus," is my cry 
 Now I've seen You as the Saviour 
 I will leave the rest behind 
 "Take the world but give me Jesus," is my cry 
 Into the world I'll go 
 That I might live this life of love 
 I won't be overcome 
 For You are in me and You are strong 
 For time and for eternity I know I'm in Your care 
 You've won my heart, now this will be my prayer: 
 "Take the world but give me Jesus" - 
 You're the treasure in this life 
 "Take the world but give me Jesus," is my cry 
 Now I've seen You as the Saviour 
 I will leave the rest behind 
 "Take the world but give me Jesus," is my cry 
 Your beauty and Your majesty are far beyond compare 
 You've won my heart, now this will be my prayer

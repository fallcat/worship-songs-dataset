Beyond this lifetime 
 Beyond this darkness there's light 
 Your cross is shining 
 So people open your eyes 
 And the cross stands above it all 
 Burning bright in this life 
 The cross towers over it all 
 One hope, one Deliverer 
 Saviour reigning high above it all 
 Above it all 
 These chains are breaking 
 Your love is shaking us free 
 A great awakening 
 This world will finally see 
 And the cross stands above it all 
 Burning bright in this life 
 The cross towers over it all 
 One hope, one Deliverer 
 Saviour reigning high above it all 
 Above it all 
 Christ has overcome 
 It is finished, He has won 
 Christ has overcome 
 Now we're standing strong 
 And the cross stands above it all 
 The cross stands above it all 
 The cross stands above it all... 
 And the cross stands above it all 
 Burning bright in this life 
 The cross towers over it all 
 One hope, one Deliverer 
 Saviour reigning high above it all 
 You are above it all! 
 How high, how wide 
 How deep is Your love 
 I see it at the cross

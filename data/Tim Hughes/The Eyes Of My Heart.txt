Every day, I see more of Your beauty 
 Every day, I know more of my frailty, Lord 
 And I can only hope 
 That I'll be changed 
 Even as I look upon Your face 
 For the eyes of my heart 
 They are on You forever 
 They are on You forever 
 For the eyes of my heart 
 They are on You forever 
 They are on You forever 
 Every day, I see more of Your greatness 
 Every day, I know more of my weakness, Lord 
 And I can only hope 
 That I'll be changed 
 Even as I look upon Your face 
 For the eyes of my heart 
 They are on You forever 
 They are on You forever 
 Yes, the eyes of my heart 
 They are on You forever 
 They are on You forever 
 Jesus, I'm in love with You 
 Jesus, I'm in love with You 
 Jesus, I'm in love with You, Lord 
 I'm in love with You, Jesus   (everyday) 
 I'm in love with You, Jesus   (everyday) 
 I'm in love with You, Jesus

 The eyes of my heart 
 They are on You forever, Jesus 
 They are on You forever

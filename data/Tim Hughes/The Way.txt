I was nowhere, You came to my rescue 
 From the grave I've been raised 
 When I needed a Saviour to save me 
 Jesus, You made a way 
 I was blind but these eyes have been opened 
 Now I walk in the light 
 Every step on this road I will follow 
 Jesus, You made a way 
 You are the way 
 You are the way 
 Lost and dead, but Your love came to find me 
 Jesus You are the way 
 You are the way 
 You are the way 
 You're the Light shining bright in the darkness 
 Jesus You are the way 
 Jesus, the only way 
 All my days are secure in Your promise 
 Never standing alone 
 You're the truth, You're the life, You're my future 
 Jesus, You made a way 
 I'm alive in that love that You give me 
 Free to dance once again 
 You will lead me from glory to glory 
 Jesus, You made a way 
 You are the way 
 You are the way 
 Lost and dead, but Your love came to find me 
 Jesus You are the way 
 Jesus, the only way 
 You are the way 
 You are the way 
 You're the light shining bright in the darkness 
 Jesus You are the way 
 You are the way 
 You are the way 
 Lost and dead, but Your love came to find me 
 Jesus You are the way 
 You are the way 
 You are the way 
 You're the light shining bright in the darkness 
 Jesus the only way 
 You are the way 
 The only way 
 You are the way 
 You are the way 
 You're the Light shining bright in the darkness 
 Jesus You are the way 
 You're the only way

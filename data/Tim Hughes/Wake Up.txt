I'm ready to rise 
 I'm ready to fall 
 To lay down my life and give it all 
 I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go 
 I'm ready for joy 
 I'm ready for pain 
 Tear open my heart Lord once again 
 I'm ready for You. I'm ready for You 
 Wake up. Rise up 
 All the earth is singing 
 Louder. Stronger 
 Shout it out and worship Him 
 All that we have will give You praise 
 Yes we were born to give You praise 
 You light up my heart 
 You light up the skies 
 You've covered the earth in glory 
 The wonder of You. The wonder of You 
 You never give up 
 You never let go 
 You give me a crown of mercy 
 The beauty of You. The beauty of You 
 Sing oh my soul rise and sing 
 Wake up my soul and sing 
 Oh my soul rise and sing 
 Sing

Get the shackles off my feet 
 So I can dance 
 I just want to praise you, 
 I just want to praise you, 
 You broke the chains now 
 I can lift my hands 
 I'm gonna praise You 
 I'm gonna praie You 
 With praise that we 
 Verbalise we let the 
 Worship rise into the 
 Throne room of the lord 
 El Shaddi 
 Oh me oh my it brings 
 Tears to my eyes when I 
 Think that you could love a 
 Sinner like I 
 So faithfully I lift my hands 
 Just to praise worshipping 
 The Lord in these 
 Revelation days 
 Becoming a saint in the 
 Race it's hard to keep the pace 
 I hold up my face and trust 
 God's amazing grace 
 I've been abast but Christ 
 Now lives in me 
 Was washed clean when I 
 See the calvary story 
 Now I give God glory 
 Walk as a rugged soldier 
 Holy spirit boldness 
 To proclaim Jehovah 
 Get the shackles off my feet 
 So I can dance 
 I just want to praise you, 
 I just want to praise you, 
 You broke the chains now 
 I can lift my hands 
 I'm gonna praise You 
 I'm gonna praie You 
 He stepped down from His 
 Glory to walk in my shoes 
 So I give what I can't keep 
 To gain what I can't lose 
 I count it all lost 
 To living for you name 
 So if you believe get down 
 On one knee 
 'Cause my Jesus Christ 
 Provides for every need 
 'Cause with Christ having joy 
 Isn't even a question 
 The goodness of life is His 
 Earthly expression 
 I'm here on attack 
 On this track that is phat 
 To remind you of the man 
 Who took the cross upon 
 His back 
 Who's blood did splat as 
 His flesh ripped and 
 Cracked 
 He was smaked and 
 Smashed with a cat of 9 
 Tails lashed 
 Did nothing to deserve this 
 It was just to reserve us 
 The right to come in prayer 
 With salvation as our 
 Purpose 
 Satan cursed us 
 But Jesus broken the chain 
 With love interceding for 
 Us day and night with his 
 Father above 
 Get the shackles off my feet 
 So I can dance 
 I just want to praise you, 
 I just want to praise you, 
 You broke the chains now 
 I can lift my hands 
 I'm gonna praise You 
 I'm gonna praie You 
 When I say Jesus you say Christ 
 Jesus - Christ 
 When say Hall you say luyah 
 Halle - luyah 
 When I say it about you say Jesus 
 It's all about - Jesus

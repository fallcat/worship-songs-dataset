When I survey the wondrous cross 
 On which the prince of glory died, 
 My richest gain I count but loss, 
 And pour contempt on all my pride. 
 See from his head, his hands, his feet, 
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down. 
 Did ever such love and sorrow meet, 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 
 Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
 That were an offering far too small; 
 Love so amazing, so divine, 
 Demands my soul, my life, my all. 
 Thanks you for the cross, I thanks you for the cross, I thanks you for the cross, my lord. 
 I love you for the cross, I love you for the cross, I love you for the cross, my lord.

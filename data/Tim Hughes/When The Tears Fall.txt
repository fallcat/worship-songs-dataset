I've had questions, without answers 
 I've known sorrow, I have known pain 
 But there's one thing that I'll cling to 
 You are faithful, Jesus You're true 
 When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour 
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer 
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart 
 In the lone hour of my sorrow 
 Through the darkest night of my soul 
 You surround me and sustain me 
 My defender, forevermore 
 When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour 
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer 
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart 
 I will praise You, I will praise You 
 When the tears fall, still I will sing to You 
 I will praise You, Jesus praise You 
 Through the suffering still I will sing 
 When hope is lost, I'll call You Saviour 
 When pain surrounds, I'll call You healer 
 When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart 
 I will praise You, I will praise You 
 When the tears fall, still I will sing to You 
 I will praise You, Jesus praise You 
 Through the suffering still I will sing to You 
 Always I'll sing to You 
 Jesus, I'll sing for You 
 When the laughter 
 Fails to comfort 
 When my heart aches 
 Lord are you there? 
 When confusion 
 Is all around me 
 And the darkness 
 Is my closest friend 
 Still I will praise You 
 Jesus praise You

When all around is fading 
 And nothing seems to last 
 When each day is filled with sorrow 
 Still I know with all my heart 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I'll fear no evil 
 For You are with me 
 Strong to deliver 
 Mighty to save 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 When I walk through fire 
 I will not be burned 
 When the waves come crashing 'round me 
 Still I know with all my heart 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I'll fear no evil 
 For You are with me 
 Strong to deliver 
 Mighty to save 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I know that 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I believe, I believe 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I know that 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 Oh, there's someone to harm you by day 
 And I know in my heart at night 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 He will watch over your coming and your going 
 Because I know 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 Strength for today, 
 And hope for tomorrow 
 He's got the whole world in His hands 
 I'll fear no evil 
 For You are with me 
 Strong to deliver 
 Mighty to save 
 He's got the whole world in His hands

Bigger than the air I breathe 
 Deeper than the ocean deep 
 Higher than the stars above You are 
 Brighter than the blazing sun 
 Louder than the screaming crowd 
 Stronger than the power of death You are 
 In the heavens, on the earth 
 There is no one like You God 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of who You are 
 Who can know the mind of God? 
 Who can understand Your ways? 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of Your great name 
 Your love can melt the hardest heart 
 Your words can bring the dead to life 
 Nothing is impossible for You 
 Awesome God, Humble King 
 You terrify yet welcome in 
 Your glory echoes all around the world 
 Yeah 
 In the heavens, on the earth 
 There is no one like You God 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of who You are 
 Who can know the mind of God? 
 Who can understand Your ways? 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of Your great name 
 You You You 
 There's always You You You 
 Unbreakable 
 Unshakable 
 Unbeatable 
 You You You 
 There's always You You You 
 Take the world 
 But give me You 
 Lord Jesus You 
 In the heavens, on the earth 
 There is no one like You God 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of who You are 
 Who can know the mind of God? 
 Who can understand Your ways? 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of Your great name 
 In the heavens, on the earth 
 There is no one like You God 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of who You are 
 Who can know the mind of God? 
 Who can understand Your ways? 
 And these words are not enough 
 To tell of Your great name 
 Take the world 
 But give me You 
 Take the world 
 But give me You 
 Take the world 
 But give me You, Jesus, You 
 Take the world 
 But give me You 
 Take the world 
 But give me You 
 Take the world 
 But give me You 
 All I want is You

I see your glory, covering the earth Lord 
 Just as the waters, covering the sea 
 I see the millions, coming to salvation 
 I see revival, fire in the land 
 I see the lost, nameless ones remembered 
 I see the widows, shouting out your praise 
 I see the friendless, loved and cele brated 
 Orphans fulfilling Lord, your calling on their lives 
 Do It Lord, do it lord 
 Do it Lord we are praying 
 Do it Lord, do it 
 That your glory may be seen 
 I see forgiveness over taking hatred 
 Pride and prejudice, now giving way to love 
 I see depression replaced with joy and gladness 
 And Satan's lies, now bowing to the truth 
 Do It Lord, do it lord 
 Do it Lord we are praying 
 Do it Lord, do it! 
 That your glory may be seen 
 This is our prayer oh God 
 This is our desperate cry 
 In these days that were living now 
 Let your kingdom come 
 Let your will be done 
 I see the brokeness of families, brought to wholeness 
 I see the prodigals, running home to you 
 Father's hearts, now turning toward their children 
 And the children's hearts, turning toward the fathers 
 I see your Church, all rising up in power 
 Laying down their lives in unity and love 
 I hear the sound of every tribe and nation 
 Giving glory to Jesus Christ the Son

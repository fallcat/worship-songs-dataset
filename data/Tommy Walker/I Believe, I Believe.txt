I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 He's my Lord He's my God 
 I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 All my hope is in Him alone 
 (Repeat) 
 What endless joy I've found 
 When I shout I am His 
 And tell the world He is mine 
 What unexplainable peace 
 To have surrendered my life 
 To a God Who loves me 
 I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 He's my Lord He's my God 
 I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 All my hope is in Him alone 
 Yeah 
 I was created for this 
 To ever trust and believe 
 In someone greater than me 
 So on this Rock I will stand 
 I'm gonna shout unashamed 
 My Savior's glorious name 
 I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 He's my Lord He's my God 
 I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 All my hope is in Him alone 
 I love to sing it 
 I love to shout it 
 I will declare it I believe in Jesus 
 (Repeat) 
 I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 He's my Lord He's my God 
 I believe I believe I believe I believe in Jesus 
 All my hope is in Him alone 
 (Repeat) 
 All my hope is in Him alone 
 All my hope is in Him alone

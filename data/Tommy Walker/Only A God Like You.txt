For the praises of man 
 I will never ever stand 
 To the kingdoms of this world 
 I'll never give my heart away or shout my praise 
 My allegiance and devotion 
 My heart's desire and all emotion 
 Go to serve the man who died upon that tree 
 Only a God like you 
 Can be worthy of my praise 
 And all my hope and faith 
 To only a king of all kings 
 Will I bow my knee and sing 
 Give my everything 
 To only my maker, my father, my savior 
 Redeemer, restorer, rebuilder, rewarder 
 To only a God like you, do I give my praise 
 For the praises of man 
 I will never ever stand 
 To the kingdoms of this world 
 I'll never give my heart away or shout my praise 
 My allegiance and devotion 
 My heart's desire and all emotion 
 Go to serve the man who died upon that tree 
 Only a God like you 
 Can be worthy of my praise 
 And all my hope and faith 
 To only a king of all kings 
 Will I bow my knee and sing 
 Give my everything 
 To only my maker, my father, my savior 
 Redeemer, restorer, rebuilder, rewarder 
 To only a God like you, do I give my praise 
 Only a God like you, Only a God like you 
 Only a God like you, Only a God like you 
 Only a God like you, Only a God like you 
 Only a God like you, Only a God like you 
 To only my maker, my father, my savior 
 Redeemer, restorer, rebuilder, rewarder 
 To only a God like you, do I give my praise

He came to live live a perfect life 
 He came to die so we'd be reconciled 
 He came to rise to show His power and might 
 That's why we praise Him that's why we sing 
 That's why we offer Him our everything 
 That's why we bow down and worship this King 
 'Cause He gave His everything 
 'Cause He gave His everything 
 He came to live live again in us 
 He came to be our conquering King and Friend 
 He came to heal and show the lost ones His love 
 He came to go prepare a place for us 
 Halle hallelujah halle hallelujah 
 Halle hallelujah halle hallelujah

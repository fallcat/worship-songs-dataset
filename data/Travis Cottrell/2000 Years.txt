If I could see 2000 years ago 
 Travel back in time and walk in the 
 Day when just one man turned this world upside down 
 If I could be a guest at the wedding, and 
 Taste the wine that was water moments before 
 Would I realize what was really in store 
 That there would be so much more 
 Would I fall down and worship? 
 Leave all that I treasured behind? 
 For a chance to be closer 
 To the Man who might 
 Be the One who saves my life? 
 If I hear His voice call to Lazarus 
 Stand and stare as my friend stumbles out of the tomb 
 Witness blind men see their first morning sky 
 Would I believe what He says to be true 
 If I was there the night soldiers took Him away 
 Would I flee the scene like most of His friends 
 Then watch on the cross what I thought was the end 
 What would I do then 
 Would I fall down and worship? 
 Leave all that I treasured behind? 
 For a chance to be closer 
 To the Man who might 
 Be the One who saves my life? 
 And what would it be like 
 After three days gone by 
 Would I believe what they said 
 Or wanna see with my own eyes 
 Put my hand on the scars 
 Only then realize 
 My Lord, my God, alive 
 Will I fall down and worship? 
 Leave all that I treasure behind? 
 For a chance to be closer 
 'Cause He is still alive 
 And the One who saves my life!

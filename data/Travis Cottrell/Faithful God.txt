I see You turning ashes to beauty 
 Bringing this dead man to life 
 Here You are in the midst of this sadness 
 Wiping the tears from my eyes 
 I can hear the song of redemption 
 Filling my heart with Your praise 
 Faithful God, You reign forever 
 We will hope in Your great name 
 Strong and mighty king of Heaven 
 We will worship You, oh, faithful God 
 You see me as a child who's forgiven 
 Clothed in the mercy of Christ 
 Here I am, unashamed and surrendered 
 I have been bought with a price 
 Can You hear the sound of Your people 
 Shaking the earth with Your praise? 
 Faithful God, You reign forever 
 We will hope in Your great name 
 Strong and mighty king of Heaven 
 We will worship You, oh, faithful God 
 You turned my morning 
 Into dancing and celebration 
 You took my sadness 
 And You gave me Your joy 
 You broke the my bondage 
 And You gave me my liberation 
 And I will ever praise You 
 And I will ever praise You 
 And I will ever praise You 
 Faithful God, You reign forever 
 We will hope in Your great name 
 Strong and mighty king of Heaven 
 We will worship You, oh, faithful God 
 Faithful God, You reign forever 
 We will hope in Your great name 
 Strong and mighty king of Heaven 
 We will worship You, oh, faithful God

On the edge of something big and brave 
 Every breath is another step of faith 
 Part of me still likes the ground where I feel safe and sound 
 But You push me, pull me and I finally let go 
 Falling, falling 
 To the heart of someone 
 So much stronger 
 Falling into love 
 Ever closer, closer to the truth 
 One by one my fears fade into blue 
 Wherever You are taking me is where I need to be 
 And You have Your reasons, who am I to say no 
 Falling, falling 
 To the heart of someone 
 So much stronger 
 Falling into love 
 I waver, You're steady 
 I falter, You never fail 
 You fight for me 
 I surrender to You, to You 
 Falling, falling 
 To the heart of someone 
 So much stronger 
 Falling into love

I believe Your love is faithful 
 When all my hopes have crumbled 
 It is standing strong and able 
 When everything else fails 
 I believe Your love will cover me 
 Through every storm 
 I am persuaded 
 Nothing in life 
 Nothing in death 
 No mountain high 
 No ocean depth 
 No power below 
 On earth or above 
 Can separate from Your love. 
 I believe beyond a shadow 
 You will never forsake me 
 And Your love endures forever 
 When all my strength is gone 
 I believe your love will carry me 
 And hold me close 
 I am persuaded 
 Nothing in life 
 Nothing in death 
 No mountain high 
 No ocean depth 
 No power below 
 On earth or above 
 Can separate from Your love.

In Christ alone 
 My hope is found 
 He is my life, my strength, my song 
 This cornerstone, this solid rock 
 Firm through the fiercest, drought and storm 
 What heights of Love, what depths of Peace, 
 When fears are stilled, when Strivings cease! 
 My comforter, my all in all 
 Here in the love of Christ I stand. 
 In Christ alone who took on flesh 
 Fulness of God in helpless babe 
 This gift of Love and righteousness, 
 Scorned by the ones He came to save, 
 Till on that cross as Jesus died 
 The wrath of god was satisfied; 
 For every sin on him was laid 
 Here in the depth of Christ I live 
 There in the ground, His body lay, 
 Light of the world by darkness slain 
 Then bursting forth in glorious day 
 Up from the grave he rose again! 
 And as he stands in victory, 
 Sin's curse has lost its grip on me 
 For I am His and He is mine 
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ 
 No guilt in life, no fear in death 
 This the pow'r of Christ in me, 
 From life's first cry, to final breath. 
 Jesus commands my destiny 
 No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man 
 Can ever pluck me from his hand 
 Till he returns or call me home 
 Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand ...

I've heard You in the thunder 
 I felt You in the rain 
 I've met You in the turmoil 
 I found You in the pain 
 But here in the stillness 
 When this moment, all is well 
 Here I'm prone to wonder 
 Hear my rebel tell 
 Cure my heart of chasing whirlwinds 
 Of needing earth to quake 
 Of wrestling made up angels 
 To keep myself away 
 There's passion in the stillness 
 There's fire in the cloud 
 There's rest that brings a man to life 
 There's a voice that whispers loud 
 Hope in my restless wandering heart 
 To find its pulse in You 
 In stillness know that You are God 
 In rest You make me new

Just as I am without one plea 
 But that Thy blood was shed for me 
 And that Thou bidst me come to Thee 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come 
 Just as I am and waiting not 
 To rid my soul of one dark blot 
 To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come 
 I come broken to be mended 
 I come wounded to be healed 
 I come desperate to be rescued 
 I come empty to be filled 
 I come guilty to be pardoned 
 By the blood of Christ the Lamb 
 And I'm welcomed with open arms 
 Praise God just as I am 
 Just as I am I would be lost 
 But mercy and grace my freedom bought 
 And now to glory in your cross 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come 
 I come broken to be mended 
 I come wounded to be healed 
 I come desperate to be rescued 
 I come empty to be filled 
 I come guilty to be pardoned 
 By the blood of Christ the Lamb 
 And I'm welcomed with open arms 
 Praise God just as I am

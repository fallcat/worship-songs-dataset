Lightly, softly the world lies sleeping 
 Heaven bells to earth below 
 Christmas morning, children waking 
 To hear the sacred story told 
 Joy to the world, the Lord has come 
 Ring the bells, ring the bells 
 Emmanuel 
 Ring the bells, ring the bells 
 Emmanuel has come 
 (Has come) 
 So join the host of angel singing 
 Glory to the new born Christ 
 Good, good news fills the sky 
 Ring the bells, ring the bells 
 Emmanuel 
 Ring the bells, ring the bells 
 Emmanuel has come 
 (Has come) 
 Our long awaited wonderful Savior 
 Has come to deliver us out of the darkness 
 And into this marvelous world 
 God has given us light, new light 
 So shine your light, shine it bright, yeah

Baby, you've been going so crazy 
 Lately, nothing seems to be going right 
 Solo, why do you have to get so low 
 You're so... 
 You've been waiting in the sun too long 
 But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing 
 For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
 Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing 
 Colder, crying on your shoulder 
 Hold her, and tell her everythings gonna be fine 
 Surely, you've been going to early 
 Hurry, cause no one's gonna be stopped 
 But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing 
 For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
 Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing 
 Baby, there's something going on today 
 But I say nothing, nothing, nothing, 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

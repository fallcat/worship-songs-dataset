For the road that leads from darkness into light 
 For the hope that rescues us from endless night 
 For the grace that covers sin at the door where life begins 
 For salvation reaching in to guide us through, thanks be to our God 
 For the healing that no mortal can explain 
 For deliverance that breaks the sinner's chains 
 For the strength to carry on and forgiveness great and strong 
 And the promise of Your mercies ever new, thanks be to our God 
 Hallelujah, everlasting songs will rise 
 For all You've done, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Thanks be to our God 
 For the emptiness that cries out to be filled 
 For the promise that Your word is deeper still 
 For the longing and the need to have more of You in me 
 Because nothing satisfies the way You do, thanks be to our God 
 Hallelujah, everlasting songs will rise 
 For all You've done, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Thanks be to our God 
 For the mysterious beyond the veil of death 
 For the peace that opens with our closing breath 
 When our struggles pass away and we finally see Your face 
 And a greater glory rises into view, thanks be to our God 
 Hallelujah, everlasting songs will rise 
 For all You've done, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Thanks be to our God 
 Hallelujah, everlasting songs will rise 
 For all You've done, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Thanks be to our God, thanks be to our God 
 Hallelujah, everlasting songs will rise 
 For all You've done, Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
 Thanks be to our God

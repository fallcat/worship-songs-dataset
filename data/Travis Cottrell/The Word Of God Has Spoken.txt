In the beginning was the word and the word was God 
 The word became flesh and dwelled among us 
 And we have seen Your glory like the rising of the sun 
 You have conquered all our darkness, the battle has been won 
 The word of God has spoken, we are changed forever 
 Power of sin is broken, we are free 
 We are running to salvation, we have been delivered 
 The word of God has spoken, we are free 
 You're the lamp unto my feet, You light my path 
 You're the only bread of life that always satisfies 
 You're the sword that cuts us deep, exposing all our sin 
 You're our healing and forgiveness, we are born again 
 The word of God has spoken, we are changed forever 
 Power of sin is broken, we are free 
 We are running to salvation, we have been delivered 
 The word of God has spoken, we are free 
 From age to age Your word will stand, forever and amen 
 From age to age Your word will stand, forever and amen 
 The word of God has spoken, we are changed forever 
 Power of sin is broken, we are free 
 We are running to salvation, we have been delivered 
 The word of God has spoken, we are free 
 The word of God has spoken, we are changed forever 
 Power of sin is broken, we are free 
 We are running to salvation, we have been delivered 
 The word of God has spoken, we are free 
 From age to age the word will stand, forever and amen 
 From age to age the word will stand, forever and amen 
 We are free, we are free 
 You will stand, Your word, Your word 
 From age to age the word will stand, forever and amen

To the King, Eternal, Immortal, Invisible 
 To the King, Eternal, to the only wise God 
 We bring honor 
 We bring glory 
 We brig praises 
 Forever Amen 
 We bring honor 
 We bring glory 
 We bring praises 
 Forever Amen 
 Forever and ever Amen 
 Let the sound ring out 
 Lift a might shout 
 Bring an offering to the King 
 Let your soul rejoice 
 With a mighty voice 
 All the praises ring 
 To the King 
 To the King

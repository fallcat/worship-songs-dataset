There's an awesome cloud of glory 
 Hanging over us tonight 
 Of the manifested presence 
 Of a holy righteous calm 
 We can feel the Fathers favor 
 We can sense the spirit near 
 Emanuel, God with us 
 Come to meet us here 
 We long for You 
 How we long for You 
 To gaze upon Your glory 
 To revel in Your love 
 We long for You 
 How we long for You 
 Our hearts are flesh, cry out for more 
 The One we were created for 
 We long for You 
 This world has left us empty 
 Man's love has made us dry 
 The pleasures of our wicked hearts 
 Can never satisfy 
 Lord, You tell us that You love us 
 And that You are longing to 
 For us to know as we are known 
 And forever be with You 
 We long for You 
 How we long for You 
 To gaze upon Your glory 
 To revel in Your love 
 We long for You 
 How we long for You 
 Our hearts are flesh, cry out for more 
 The One we were created for 
 We long for You 
 You have made us in Your image 
 To be Your only pride 
 Worlds apart, still You are here 
 Dwelling deep inside 
 Till the fullness of Your presence comes 
 And Jesus splits the sky 
 And I pray this longing then would be 
 Forever satisfied, forever satisfied 
 Satisfied 
 Come, Jesus come, Jesus come 
 Come, Jesus come, Jesus come 
 We long for You 
 How we long for You 
 To gaze upon Your glory 
 To revel in Your love 
 We long for You 
 How we long for You 
 Our hearts are flesh, cry out for more 
 The One we were created for 
 We long for You 
 We long for You 
 We long for You

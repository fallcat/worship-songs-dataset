I said I belong to You 
 But in a secret room, I kept a secret list 
 I said, "Anything for You" 
 "Anything but this, anything but this" 
 You knew it all along 
 You knew it very well 
 You knew the sturdy walls I hid behind 
 Were nothing but a prison cell 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 You have opened all the windows 
 Opened all the doors 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 I feel the wind of freedom like I never did before 
 The light is filling up the corners 
 Dancing on the floor 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 You have always been the same 
 I ran away from You 
 I ran away from You 
 Every time You called my name 
 I tried to hide the truth 
 I tried to hide the truth 
 You knew it all along 
 You knew it very well 
 You knew the more I covered up my heart 
 The more I didn't know myself 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 You have opened all the windows 
 Opened all the doors 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 I feel the wind of freedom like I never did before 
 The light is filling up the corners 
 Dancing on the floor 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 No room for fear 
 No room, no room 
 No room for fear 
 Perfect love is living here 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 You have opened all the windows 
 Opened all the doors 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 I feel the wind of freedom like I never did before 
 The light is filling up the corners 
 Dancing on the floor 
 I am not afraid anymore

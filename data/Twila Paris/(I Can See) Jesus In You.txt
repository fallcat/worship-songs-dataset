The eyes are young 
 I won't deny it 
 But oh, the dream of tender youth 
 The seed is small 
 Do not despise it 
 Put on the robe and speak the truth 
 'Cause the only thing that matters 
 When the day has turned to night 
 Is a heart that knows the wonder 
 Of the mercy and the light 
 I can see Jesus in you 
 I see His love on your face 
 Go in His name and do all He commands you to do 
 I see Jesus in you 
 He brought you here 
 To build the kingdom 
 I see it burning in your eyes 
 The time is near 
 You must be ready 
 Do not be tempted by the lies 
 There is nothing that can hold you back 
 The wind has found the flame 
 You are called and you are chosen 
 You will never be the same 
 I can see Jesus in you 
 I see His love on your fact 
 Go in His name and do all He commands you to do 
 I see Jesus 
 I see Jesus 
 I can see Jesus in you 
 I can see Jesus in you 
 I see His love on your face 
 Go in His name and do all He commands you to do 
 I see Jesus in you 
 I do 
 I see Jesus in you 
 I do 
 I see Jesus in you

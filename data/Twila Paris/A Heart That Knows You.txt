Thought I knew so much 
 But I've got so much to learn. 
 Got so far to go, so much left to burn. 
 Thought I knew you well, 
 But I struggle in your hands. 
 Here again you bring the truth before me. 
 Freedom only comes when I let go, 
 This I know. 
 And a heart that knows you 
 Is a heart that can wait, 
 Die to the dearest desire. 
 And a heart that knows you 
 Is a heart that can still celebrate, 
 Following love through the fire. 
 You would never lead where you had not been. 
 Every road I face, you go down again. 
 Time has come and gone since you walked into the flame. 
 Still there is the pain before the glory. 
 And it is your will I must embrace. 
 Oh, for grace. 
 And a heart that knows you 
 Is a heart that can wait, 
 Die to the dearest desire. 
 And a heart that knows you 
 Is a heart that can still celebrate, 
 Following love through the fire. 
 It may be for my sake, 
 Just to help me grow. 
 May be for your kingdom, Lord, 
 I don't need to know. 
 (Oh, a heart) 
 And a heart that knows you 
 Is a heart that can wait, 
 Die to the dearest desire. 
 And a heart that knows you 
 Is a heart that can still celebrate, (Celebrate) 
 Following love through the fire.

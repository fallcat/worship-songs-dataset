Only You go with me to the secret places 
 I would never dare to go alone 
 And You walk with me 
 And You talk with me 
 And I listen closely for the quiet wind 
 Oh, let me take You in 
 And in the morning, when I rise 
 Let me hear Your voice again 
 All my love, all I do 
 All my heart belongs to You 
 All my life I go through 
 All my heart belongs to You 
 There are no other eyes that can see inside me 
 Answer every question in my heart 
 When You hold my hand 
 There's a place to stand 
 And I follow at Your footstep in the dark 
 Oh, let me take You in 
 And in the morning, when I rise 
 I will see Your face again 
 All my love, all I do 
 All my heart belongs to You 
 All my life I go through 
 All my heart belongs to You 
 Oh, let me take You in 
 And in the morning, when I rise 
 I will see Your face again 
 'Cause all my love, all I do 
 All my heart belongs to You 
 All my life, let me prove 
 All my heart belongs to You 
 All my love, all I do 
 All my heart belongs to You 
 All my life I go through 
 All my heart belongs to You

And we know that all things work together 
 Yes we know that all things work together 
 For those who are called 
 Those who love God 
 Those who are called 
 Called to Your purpose 
 All things work together 
 All things work together 
 All things work together 
 Work together for good 
 So we lift up our hearts 
 Lift up our hands 
 Lift up our hope in You 
 Though we may not yet understand 
 We know it's true

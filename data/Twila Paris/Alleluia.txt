As long as I have breath to sing 
 Alleluia 
 I will worship You my King, 
 Alleluia 
 I will come before Your throne 
 Give my heart to You alone 
 You have called me as Your own 
 Alleluia 
 No matter where on earth I stand 
 Alleluia 
 I am resting in Your hand 
 Alleluia 
 Casting every fear aside 
 In Your shadow I will hide 
 You have called me to abide 
 Alleluia

 Amen

 I will sing to You my Lord

 I will sing forevermore 
 Alleluia 
 When we see Your holy place 
 All the children of Your grace 
 Filled with neverending praise 
 Alleluia

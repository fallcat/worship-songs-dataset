Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me! 
 I once was lost, but now am found 
 Was blind, but now I see. 
 Through many dangers, toils, and snares 
 I have already come. 
 'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far 
 And Grace will lead me home. 
 When we've been there ten thousand years 
 Bright shining as the sun, 
 We've no less days to sing God's praise 
 Than when we'd first begun.

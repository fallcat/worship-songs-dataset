Arise, my soul, arise; shake off thy guilty fears; 
 The bleeding sacrifice in my behalf appears: 
 Before the throne my surety stands, 
 Before the throne my surety stands, 
 My name is written on His hands. 
 Five bleeding wounds He bears; received on Calvary; 
 They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me: 
 "Forgive him, O forgive," they cry, 
 "Forgive him, O forgive," they cry, 
 "Don't let that ransomed sinner die!" 
 My God is reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear; 
 He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear: 
 With confidence I now draw nigh, 
 With confidence I now draw nigh, 
 And "Father, Abba, Father," cry. 
 Arise, my soul, arise 
 Arise, my soul, arise 
 Arise, my soul, arise 
 Arise, my soul, arise

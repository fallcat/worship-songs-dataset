Away in a manger, no crib for a bed 
 The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head 
 The stars in the sky look down where He lay 
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay 
 The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes 
 But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes 
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky 
 And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh 
 Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay 
 Close by me forever and love me, I pray 
 Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care 
 And take us to heaven to live with Thee there.

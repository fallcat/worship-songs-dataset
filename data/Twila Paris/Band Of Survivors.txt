There is a war raging on 
 Between the right and wrong 
 And we have encountered the darkness 
 But as each night moves along 
 We face another dawn 
 To reach for the courage of love 
 As the fainthearted run for the shelter of home 
 There's a question that hangs in the air 
 When the smoke clears away from the battlefield 
 Who will be there 
 Will you stand with the band of survivors 
 Hand in hand 'til the end of the day 
 Taking the land with the band of survivors 
 Tried in the fire 
 Will you stand with the band 
 These are the ones 
 He will choose to win the victory 
 And He will declare it is over 
 And so we honor the call 
 Remain upon the wall 
 And trust in the name of our God 
 When the body is weak and the heart is afraid 
 Then be strong for the message is clear 
 When the banner is raised on the mountain 
 We still will be here 
 Will you stand with the band of survivors 
 Hand in hand 'til the end of the day 
 Taking the land with the band of survivors 
 Tried in the fire 
 Will you stand 
 Will you stand in the path of the strong man 
 To be counted for all you believe 
 Will you stand with the heart of a warrior 
 By the blood of the Lamb 
 In the name of the King 
 Will you stand with the band of survivors 
 Hand in hand 'til the end of the day 
 Taking the land with the band of survivors 
 Tried in the fire 
 Will you stand with the band 
 Will you stand with the band

Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart; Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art. 
 Thou my best thought, by day or by night; Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light. 
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise, Thou mine inheritance, now and always. 
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart; High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art. 
 High King of heaven, my victory won, May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'ns Son! 
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, still be my vision, O ruler of all. 
 Be Thou my Wisdom, Thou my true Word; I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord; 
 Thou my great Father, I thy true son; Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one. 
 Be Thou my battle-shield, sword for my fight, Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight. 
 Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower. Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

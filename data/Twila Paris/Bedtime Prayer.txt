Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray dear Lord that you will keep 
 Your eyes upon this sleeping world 
 Every little boy and girl 
 Bless the children far away 
 The ones who don't know how to pray 
 Those who are not feeling well 
 The little one the slipped and fell 
 Bless the puppy down the street 
 The neighbors I have yet to meet 
 Bless my mom and dad especially 
 Just one more thing I'd like to say 
 Before I close another day 
 I'd like to thank you Lord for all the ways 
 That You bless me 
 Bless the child whose home is torn 
 The babies who are not yet born 
 Bless the ones who take your word 
 To all the hearts that have not heard 
 Bless all your children everywhere 
 I hope they know how much you care 
 Maybe someday I can go 
 And tell them that You love them so 
 Bless Grandma and my Grandpa too 
 And all my friend and all they do 
 Bless every twig upon my family tree 
 Just one more thing I'll say to you 
 I'm so amazed by all you do 
 I'll thank you once again because it's true 
 That you bless me

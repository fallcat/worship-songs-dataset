Like tightly woven garment, like a metal alloy, 
 We are put together in the strongest way. 
 With a common bond to join us that they cannot destroy 
 We are held together in the longest way. 
 And we could not be pulled apart 
 Without it tearing out a heart. 
 Bonded together, 
 You are my Father forever. 
 You will never leave me, 
 We are bonded together. 
 There is never space between us for a separation. 
 We are put together in the tightest way. 
 And a holy fusion causes this amalgamation. 
 We are held together in the brightest way. 
 We could not be pulled apart 
 Without it tearing out a heart. 
 Bonded together, 
 I am your servant forever. 
 I will never leave you, 
 We are bonded together. 
 You cling to me. I cling to you. 
 You cling to me. I am clinging too. 
 I am clinging too. 
 Bonded together, 
 You are my Father forever. 
 You will never leave me, 
 We are bonded together. 
 I am your servant forever. 
 I will never leave you, 
 We are bonded together. 
 Bonded together. 
 Bonded together. 
 Bonded together.

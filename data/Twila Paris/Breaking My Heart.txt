There's an ache in my heart 
 I've been away 
 We've been apart 
 I've been trying to hide 
 Swallowed in fear 
 Covered in pride 
 Truth analyzed 
 Rebel disguised in smiles 
 Breaking my heart 
 You've been breaking my heart again 
 Making me start again 
 Breaking my heart 
 I feel so insecure 
 Tender and weak 
 Scared and unsure 
 I've been peeled to the core 
 My head is tired 
 My heart is sore 
 Truth emphasized 
 I have despised Your love 
 Breaking my heart 
 You've been breaking my heart again 
 Making me start again 
 Breaking my heart 
 I needed to fall 
 I needed to lose it all 
 I needed to cry 
 I needed to wonder why 
 Breaking my heart 
 You've been breaking my heart again 
 Making me start again 
 Breaking my heart 
 Breaking my heart 
 You've been breaking my heart again 
 Making me start again 
 Breaking my heart

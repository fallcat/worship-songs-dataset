Living in this temple, 
 Dealing with this clay, 
 I've been known to compromise, 
 You have seen me turn away 
 Though I am distracted by a temporary thrill 
 I could never live outside the center of Your will. 
 Resolutions broken, promises unkept. 
 You have held my faithless heart 
 Like a father while You wept 
 I've been on the edge before, and I have felt the chill 
 But I could never live outside the center of Your will. 
 Keep me in the center- 
 In the center of Your will 
 Center of Your will 
 (Repeat/echo/harmony) 
 I am bought and chosen, servant to the throne 
 Following a higher call, for my life is not my own. 
 Though I sometimes fear this place, and find it hard to fill 
 I could never live outside the center of Your will

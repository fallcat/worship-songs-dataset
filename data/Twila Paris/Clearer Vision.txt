Never before have I seen through the door 
 Now it is open wide 
 Show me again how I fit in Your plan 
 I want to come inside 
 Into the road where the light is bright 
 Into Your heart, where my view is higher 
 Take me away 
 Take me away 
 Make Your desire mine 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 Your command is my decision 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 For the mission 
 I've been given clearer vision 
 You make me see so much more than just me 
 How could I be so blind? 
 Now I can know where You want me to go 
 Looking inside Your mind 
 Into the road where the light is bright 
 Into Your heart, where my view is higher 
 Take me away 
 Take me away 
 Make Your desire mine 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 Your command is my decision 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 Clearer vision 
 For the mission 
 I've been given clearer vision 
 I've been given clearer vision

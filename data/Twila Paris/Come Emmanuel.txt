Come and speak to us 
 Come and renew us 
 Come and live through us, Emmanuel 
 Grace to implore us 
 Ever before us 
 Come and restore us, Emmanuel 
 Come Emmanuel 
 Come Emmanuel (2x) 
 Once mercy found us 
 Still You astound us 
 Hold and surround us, Emmanuel 
 Living inside us 
 Faithful to guide us 
 Cover and hide us, Emmanuel 
 Love that begins us 
 Pardons and wins us 
 Come and reign in us, Emmanuel 
 Come and speak to us 
 Fill and renew us 
 Come and live through us, Emmanuel

Little children like to form a circle 
 Tightly holding hands with all their friends 
 An imaginary line around them, 
 Keeping out the ones who are not in 
 But standing on the edge is not the same 
 And those who watch can never win the game 
 Are you on the outside (3x) 
 Come on in (3x) 
 There's a family that has formed a circle 
 Though its tightly arms are open wide 
 But there is a line you must cross over 
 If you really want to come inside 
 But standing on the edge is not the same 
 And those who watch can never share the name 
 Are you on the outside (Come on in) (3x) 
 Come on in (3x) 
 The line becomes a wall 
 When you stading behind it 
 But grace can make the door 
 If you choose to find it 
 Are you on the outside (Come on in) (3x) 
 Come on in (3x)

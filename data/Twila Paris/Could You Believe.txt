He was a friend to sinners 
 He was a gentle man 
 Beautiful, humble master plan 
 His voice could pierce the darkness 
 Quiet an angry sea 
 I hear Him saying follow me 
 I look in your eyes and I tell you these things 
 But somehow I know that it's hard to believe 
 Could you believe if I really was like Him 
 If I lived all the words that I said 
 If for a change I would kneel down before you 
 And serve you instead 
 Could you believe 
 He was the Lamb of mercy 
 Undying hope of men 
 Waiting for love to come again 
 He is the light of heaven 
 Radiant Prince of peace 
 I Hear him saying, "Follow Me" 
 I look in your eyes and I tell you these things 
 But somehow I know that it's hard to believe 
 Could you believe if I carried my own cross 
 If I saw that the children were fed 
 If for a moment I held my opinion 
 And quietly led Could you believe 
 I am meant to be a pure reflection of the truth 
 So above it all I pray that I will not obscure the view 
 Could you believe if I stood here transparent 
 And through me you could see his eyes 
 Could you believe if you saw right inside me 
 And there was no disguise 
 Could you believe if I was really like him 
 If I lived all the words that I said 
 If it was clear that I held in my heart 
 What I know in my head 
 Could you believe, could you believe 
 Looking at me, could you believe 
 Could you believe?

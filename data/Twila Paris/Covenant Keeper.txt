Covenant maker, I made a start 
 Covenant breaker, I broke Your heart 
 Your word is deeper 
 Faithful and true 
 Covenant keeper, make me like You 
 Covenant maker, You made a way 
 Infinite taker, I made You pay 
 But Your love was deeper 
 Faithful and true 
 Covenant keeper, make me like You 
 Your word is deeper 
 Faithful and true 
 Covenant keeper, make me like You 
 Make me like You

I will cry for the desert 
 When He's bleeding from His heart and soul 
 Die for the desert 
 And remove my hands from what I hold 
 Deeper in my heart I will hear Him call 
 Deeper in my heart I will give it all 
 Deeper in my heart 
 I will cry for the desert 
 Oh 
 I will cry for the desert 
 Oh 
 I will cry 
 Cry for the desert; 
 I will tremble and receive His pain 
 Die for the desert; 
 I will pour my life on this terrain 
 Deeper in my heart I will hear Him call 
 Deeper in my heart I will give it all 
 Deeper in my heart 
 The smallest grain of sand 
 Is held inside my hand 
 And when I look 
 I see His face 
 The smallest grain of sand 
 Is held inside my hand 
 And when I look 
 I see His face

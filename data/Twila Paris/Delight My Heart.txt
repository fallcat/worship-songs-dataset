So many plans, so many dreams 
 So many hopes in me 
 So many goals tending to schemes 
 What am I meant to be? 
 Lead me back into the simple treasure I once knew 
 I will rest here in the perfect worth of knowing You 
 I will delight my heart in You, O Lord 
 I will delight my heart in You 
 All of the joy You give is what I long for 
 I will delight my heart in You 
 All that I want, think that I need 
 Where is the pure desire? 
 If I look up into Your eyes 
 I could regain the fire 
 Oh, return me to the simple treasure I once knew 
 I will live here in the perfect worth of knowing You 
 I will delight my heart in You, O Lord 
 I will delight my heart in You 
 All of the peace You give is what I long for 
 I will delight my heart in You 
 How can I forget that nothing less can fill me 
 When the Morning Star has come to live inside me 
 Live inside me 
 I will delight my heart in You, O Lord 
 I will delight my heart in You 
 All of the love You give is what I long for 
 I will delight my heart in You 
 Oh, I will delight my heart in You

Buried in the heart of every child of his creation 
 Is a deep desire for which we seldom find the words. 
 As each poet sings of searching for his own salvation, 
 Once again a common truth is heard, 
 Beating out the question 
 Only honest and courageous hearts will answer. (Will answer) 
 Do you know him? This is your destiny. (Destiny) 
 When you obey him, there is an open door 
 Do you believe? And will you love him? This is your destiny.(Destiny) 
 When you obey him, there is an open door to your unspoken dreams. 
 Even we who call his name so often miss the treasure. 
 Still a voice of wisdom cries to those who will be stirred, 
 Sounding in the silence of dishonest weight and measure. 
 Once again a common truth is heard, 
 Beating out the question 
 Only honest and courageous hearts will answer. (Will answer) 
 Do you know him? This is your destiny. (Destiny) 
 When you obey him, there is an open door 
 Do you believe? And will you love him? This is your destiny.(Destiny) 
 When you obey him, there is an open door to your unspoken dreams. 
 If you seek him you will find him. 
 If you seek him you will find him. 
 If you seek him you will find him. 
 You will find him. 
 Do you know him? This is your destiny 
 When you obey him there is an open door 
 Do you believe? And will you love him? 
 This is your destiny 
 When you obey him, there is an open door to your unspoken dreams 
 (Fading out) 
 Do you know him? This is your destiny 
 When you obey him...

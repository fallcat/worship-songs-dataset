Sometimes my little heart can't understand. 
 What's in your will? What's in your plan? 
 So many times I'm tempted to ask you why. 
 But I can never forget it for long, 
 Lord, what you do could not be wrong, 
 So I believe you, even when I must cry. 
 Do I trust you Lord? Does the river flow? 
 Do I trust you Lord? Does the north wind blow? 
 You can see my heart, you can read my mind 
 And You've got to know I would rather die 
 Than to lose my faith in the one I love. 
 Do I trust you Lord? Do I trust you? 
 Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on you, 
 Following you, following you. 
 My Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on you 
 Following you, following you. 
 I won't look to the left or right 
 My only goal is keeping you in my sight. 
 Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on you, 
 Following you, following you. 
 My Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on you 
 Following you, following you, 
 My Lord. 
 We will glorify the King of Kings. 
 We will glorify the Lamb. 
 We will the glorify the Lord of Lords 
 Who is the great I Am. 
 Who is the great I Am. 
 Who is... 
 I will trust you, Lord, when I don't know why. 
 I will trust you, Lord, till the day I die. 
 I will trust you, Lord, when I'm blind with pain. 
 You were God before and you never change. 
 I will trust you. 
 I will trust you. 
 I will trust you Lord. 
 I will trust you. 
 I will trust you. 
 I will trust you Lord.

Sometimes my little heart can't understand 
 What's in Your will, what's in Your plan. 
 So many times I'm tempted to ask You why, 
 But I can never forget it for long. 
 Lord, what You do could not be wrong. 
 So I believe You, even when I must cry. 
 Do I trust You, Lord? 
 Does the river flow? 
 Do I trust You, Lord? 
 Does the north wind blow? 
 You can see my heart, 
 You can read my mind, 
 And You've got to know 
 That I would rather die 
 Than to lose my faith 
 In the One I love. 
 Do I trust You, Lord? 
 Do I trust You? 
 I know the answers, I've given them all. 
 But suddenly now, I feel so small. 
 Shaken down to the cavity in my soul. 
 I know the doctrine and theology, 
 But right now they don't mean much to me. 
 This time there's only one thing I've got to know. 
 Do I trust You, Lord? 
 Does the robin sing? 
 Do I trust You, Lord? 
 Does it rain in spring? 
 You can see my heart, 
 You can read my mind, 
 And You've got to know 
 I would rather die 
 Than to lose my faith 
 In the One I love. 
 Do I trust You, Lord? 
 Do I trust You? 
 I will trust You, Lord, when I don't know why. 
 I will trust You, Lord, till the day I die. 
 I will trust You, Lord, when I'm blind with pain! 
 You were God before, and You'll never change. 
 I will trust You. 
 I will trust You. 
 I will trust You, Lord. 
 I will trust You 
 I will trust You. 
 I will trust You. 
 I will trust You, Lord. 
 I will trust You 
 I will trust You. 
 I will trust You. 
 I will trust You, Lord.

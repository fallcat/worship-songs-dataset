Down in yon forest there stands a hall 
 The bells of paradise, I heard them ring 
 It's cover'd all over with purple and pall 
 And I love my Lord Jesus above anything 
 In that hall there stands a bed 
 The bells of paradise I heard them ring 
 It's cover'd all over with scarlet and red 
 And I love my Lord Jesus above anything 
 Under that bed there runs a flood 
 The bells of paradise I heard them ring 
 The one half runs water, the other runs blood 
 And I love my Lord Jesus above anything 
 Over that bed the moon shines bright 
 The bells of paradise I heard them ring 
 Denoting our Savior was born this night 
 And I love my Lord Jesus above anything

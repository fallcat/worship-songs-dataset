The holiest of hearts the holiest of rooms 
 We had no right to come inside 
 Until we found the tomb 
 Now we are not alone 
 And from Your gracious throne 
 You gently call us home to enter in 
 Enter in, come into My presence 
 Enter in, come boldly in My name 
 I open up the door to life forevermore 
 Leave all you were before and enter in 
 We gather in this place to worship at Your feet 
 In reverence and unison the mystery is sweet 
 A simple offering of hearts to You we bring 
 And we invite the King to enter in 
 Enter in, fill us with Your presence 
 Enter in, we come here in Your name 
 We open up the door, we wait before you Lord 
 We ask You now once more to enter in 
 I open up the door to life forevermore 
 Leave all you were before and enter in 
 We humbly ask You Lord to enter in

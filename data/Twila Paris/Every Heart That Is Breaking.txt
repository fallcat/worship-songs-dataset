For the young abandoned husband 
 Left alone without a reason 
 For the pilgrim in the city 
 Where there is no home 
 For the son without a father 
 For his solitary mother 
 I have a message' 
 He sees you, He knows you 
 He loves you, He loves you 
 Every heart that is breaking, tonight 
 Is the heart of a child that he holds in his sight. 
 And, oh, how He longs to hold in his arms 
 Every heart that is breaking, tonight 
 Every heart that is breaking, tonight 
 For every heart 
 For the precious fallen daughter 
 For her devastated father 
 For the prodigal who's dying in a strange new way 
 For the child who's always hungry 
 For the patriot with no country 
 I have a message' 
 He sees you, He knows you 
 He loves you, Jesus loves you 
 Every heart that is breaking, tonight 
 Is the heart of a child that he holds in his sight. 
 And, oh, how He longs to hold in his arms 
 Every heart that is breaking, tonight 
 Every heart that is breaking, tonight 
 Every heart that is breaking, tonight 
 For every heart

As the sun rises in the east 
 So He shall split the eastern sky 
 Sword in hand upon the mountain 
 Fire of Heaven in His eye 
 And every knee shall bow 
 Every knee shall bow 
 We kneel before Him now 
 And every knee shall bow 
 Come the dawn of the Prince of Peace 
 Like the morning after rain 
 There shall be no more hatred 
 Neither sorrow 
 Neither pain 
 And every knee shall bow 
 Every knee shall bow 
 We kneel before You now 
 And every knee shall bow

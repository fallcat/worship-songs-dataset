Once in a while my heart gets lonely 
 Once in a while the night is blue 
 Time and again. You are the only One 
 I can hold on to 
 There never is a moment when 
 You leave my side 
 I felt Your arms around me 
 Every time I cried 
 All my life 
 You have been a faithful Father 
 I believe Your word is true 
 You have been a faithful Father 
 I will follow you 
 There was a fear inside my anger 
 I wasn't sure You were there 
 Great love would prove 
 You are the answer to 
 Any honest prayer 
 The vessel that is empty 
 You will come and fill 
 You promise to complete me and 
 I know you will 
 I know you will 
 Wherever You lead me 
 You' the passion that freed me 
 You' whenever You call 
 Whatever You say 
 Once in a while my heart gets lonely 
 Once in a while the night is blue 
 Time and again You are the only One

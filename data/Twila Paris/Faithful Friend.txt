(Female) 
 Everyone knows you as a man of honor 
 I am glad to know you simply as a friend 
 You've always taken time to be my brother 
 And I'll be standing by you in the end 
 But I will never put you on a pedestal 
 I thank the Lord for everything you do 
 I'll be there to pray for you and for the ones you love 
 I believe that He will finish all he started in you. 
 Chorus (Female only): 
 I will be an open door that you can count on 
 Anywhere you are, anywhere you've been 
 I will be an honest heart you can depend on 
 I will be a faithful friend 
 (Male) 
 I am one of many whose path has been made clear 
 By the light you've carried faithfully as a warrior and a child 
 God has used you greatly to encourage and inspire 
 And you've remained a true friend all the while 
 So I will never put you on a pedestal 
 'Cause we both know all the glory is the Lord's 
 But I'll be there to pray that He will keep you by his grace 
 And I always will remind you to be seeking His face 
 Chorus (Female and Male) 
 (Female) 
 Should there ever come a time to cry 
 I will weep with you 
 And every single time you win 
 I'm celebrating too 
 (Female and Male) 
 Oh, I will celebrate with you 
 Chorus (Both) 
 (Male) 
 I will be faithful 
 (Female) 
 Ooh I will be a faithful friend

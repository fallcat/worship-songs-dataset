Fill my heart 
 Fill this house 
 Fill this day, O Lord 
 I am weak 
 And I need Your grace 
 You are the only Light 
 You are the Way of Life 
 Fill my heart 
 Fill this house 
 Fill this day, O Lord 
 Fill my heart 
 Fill this house 
 Fill this day, O Lord 
 I am Yours 
 I will give You praise 
 You are the only Truth 
 And I will follow You 
 Fill my heart 
 Fill this house 
 Fill this day, O Lord 
 Fill my spirit with Your spirit 
 Until I cannot contain it 
 Fill my heart with love that cannot be explained 
 Fill another earthen vessel until grace is overflowing 
 And this barren earth is covered by Your rain 
 Fill my heart 
 Fill this house 
 Fill this day, O Lord 
 Speak Your Word 
 And I will obey 
 So open eyes can see 
 All You are in me 
 Fill my heart 
 Fill this house 
 Fill this day, O Lord 
 The more I live I know 
 I need You more than ever so 
 Please come and fill this open room 
 Inside of me 
 (The more You give I see 
 Your heart is springing up in me 
 This love is here it overflows 
 And so it goes 
 The more I live I know 
 I need You more than ever so 
 Please come and fill this open room 
 Inside of me 
 The more You give I see 
 Your heart is springing up in me 
 This love is here it overflows 
 And so it goes)

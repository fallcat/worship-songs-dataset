When I look into Your eyes 
 I see the love that died for me 
 When I look into Your eyes 
 I see the hope that I will be a faithful child 
 Following close behind 
 Following ever blinded 
 To the things that should not move me 
 Saying to my soul 
 Fix your eyes on Jesus 
 Saying to my soul 
 Fix your eyes on Jesus 
 Fix your eyes on Jesus (*3) 
 When I look into Your eyes 
 I feel the grief when I have sinned 
 When I look into Your eyes 
 I find delight 
 When I have been a faithful child 
 Fix your eyes upon the prize 
 The highest calling you will find 
 Following close behind 
 Following ever blinded 
 To the things that should not move me

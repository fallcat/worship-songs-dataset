Lord whose Word began creation 
 We will worship You 
 Sovereign King of every nation 
 We will worship You 
 Until the end of endless time 
 Live to fulfill Your true design 
 For Eternity 
 We will worship You 
 Lord of life and love we seek Your face 
 And we stand here only by Your grace 
 Lest the rocks cry out 
 We will sing Your praise 
 We will shout the Name that set us free 
 For Eternity 
 Cornerstone of our foundation 
 We will worship You 
 Giver of the one salvation 
 We will worship You 
 Until the end of endless days 
 Declare the glory of Your ways

For the Glory of the Lord 
 We have been created 
 Living text of written Word 
 Mercy demonstrated 
 We are made a channel 
 Where His grace is poured 
 Witness of Salvation 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 Willingly, we suffer 
 Laid upon this Holy Cross 
 Dying with our Brother 
 His Divine Fulfillment 
 Our complete reward 
 Crucified rejoicing 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 We advance united 
 Following Christ's blazing sword 
 His Dominion sighted 
 All that has been taken 
 It shall be restored 
 This eternal anthem 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 For the Glory of the Lord 
 For the Glory of the Lord

Minute by minute 
 You live and new choices are made 
 Building eternity 
 Every stone will be laid 
 Live for the moment, you'll only be wasting your time 
 You need to look through the eyes of forever to find 
 True value 
 Forever eyes 
 Forever eyes 
 They will never tell you lies 
 Forever eyes 
 You don't need to compromise 
 When you have forever eyes 
 Some people say 
 That you're crazy for planning ahead 
 Making investments 
 That only pay off when you're dead 
 Living for pleasure, you'll bury a treasure in time 
 You've got to choose what you do through the eyes that define 
 True value 
 Forever eyes 
 Forever eyes 
 They will never tell you lies 
 Forever eyes 
 You don't need to compromise 
 When you have forever eyes 
 Are you really making a change with what you do? 
 Do you ever think you're a stranger to the truth? 
 Have you been afraid to let go of your plan? 
 Do you hold a dream that will die in your hand? 
 Forever eyes 
 Forever eyes 
 They will never tell you lies 
 Forever eyes 
 You don't need to compromise 
 When you have forever eyes 
 Do you have forever eyes? 
 Forever eyes 
 Do you have forever eyes? 
 Forever eyes 
 You can have forever eyes

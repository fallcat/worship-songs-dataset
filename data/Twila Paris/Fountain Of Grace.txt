You have been faithful when I have been faithless, 
 Oh unending Fountain of Grace 
 For ever giving when I have been selfish, 
 Oh unending Fountain of Grace 
 Still the beginning of all that is holy 
 Unsearchable ancient of days 
 I kneel before You and offer this vessel, 
 Oh unending Fountain of Grace 
 You were the constant when I chose to wander, 
 Oh, unending Fountain of Grace 
 You were forgiveness when I cried for mercy, 
 Oh, unending Fountain of Grace 
 You are the Author of all that is finished, 
 I owe You my life and my praise 
 I kneel before You 
 And offer this vessel, 
 Oh unending Fountain of Grace 
 Pour out the water of life on this vessel, 
 Oh unending Fountain of Grace

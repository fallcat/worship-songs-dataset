We are the servants of the only King 
 He is worthy 
 Given dominion over everything 
 He is worthy 
 We will declare it with one voice 
 We will stand up and make a holy noise 
 And make a holy noise 
 Courus: 
 Glory and honor 
 Glory and power 
 Glory and honor unto the Lamb 
 Glory and honor 
 Glory forever 
 Glory and honor unto the Lamb 
 We offer Him a sacrificial praise 
 He is worthy 
 No one among us is above His grace 
 He is worthy 
 We will declare it with one voice 
 He has become the reason we rejoice 
 The reason we rejoice 
 Courus 
 Glory, honor and power 
 Be to the Lamb of God forever and ever 
 Glory, honor and power 
 Be to the Lamb forever 
 The Son of Heaven who would die for us 
 He is worthy 
 Eternal Word of God alive in us 
 He is worthy 
 We will declare it with one voice 
 We will declare that we have made our choice 
 And make a holy noise 
 Courus (2x)

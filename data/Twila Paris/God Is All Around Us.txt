The sun behind the mountain is setting in the west 
 The bluebird and her little ones are gathered in their nest 
 And I am on my pillow because I need my rest 
 God is all around us, and He knows best 
 He's higher than the treetops in the tallest wood 
 Why He would come and speak to me, I'd tell you if I could 
 It makes me want to please Him in all the ways I should 
 God is all around us, and He is good 
 God is all around us everywhere we go 
 Caring for His children that's all I need to know 
 He's stronger than the eagle circling above 
 He's wiser the oldest owl more gentle than a dove 
 He's closer than pajamas that fit me like a glove 
 God is all around us, and He is Love

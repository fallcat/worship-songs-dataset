This is no time for fear 
 This is a time for faith and determination 
 Don't lose the vision here 
 Carried away by the motion 
 Hold on to all that you hide in your heart 
 There is one thing that has always been true 
 It holds the world together 
 God is in control 
 We believe that His children will not be forsaken 
 God is in control 
 We will choose to remember and never be shaken 
 There is no power above or beside Him, we know, oh 
 God is in control, oh God is in control 
 History marches on 
 There is a bottom line drawn across the ages 
 Culture can make its plan 
 Oh, but the line never changes 
 No matter how the deception may fly 
 There is one thing that has always been true 
 It will be true forever 
 God is in control 
 We believe that His children will not be forsaken 
 God is in control 
 We will choose to remember and never be shaken 
 There is no power above or beside Him, we know, oh 
 God is in control, oh God is in control 
 He has never let you down 
 Why start to worry now? 
 Why start to worry now? 
 He is still the Lord of all we see 
 And He is still the loving Father 
 Watching over you and me 
 Watching over you, watching over me 
 Watching over everything 
 Watching over you, watching over me, 
 Every little sparrow, every little king, oh 
 Every little king, oh 
 God is in control 
 We believe that His children will not be forsaken 
 God is in control 
 We will choose to remember and never be shaken 
 There is no power above or beside Him, we know, oh 
 God is in control, oh 
 God is in control, oh 
 God is in control, oh 
 God is in control

Tiny baby, born too soon; 
 Not much future to hope for. 
 Tears and whispers fill this room, 
 And hearts will burst with love... 
 And gifted hands will do their best, 
 And care so very much, 
 But it is not enough, 
 It is not enough! 
 God of miracles, come and be with us, 
 We will trust in you, to deliver us! 
 Kind and noble King, kneeling in the dust: 
 So predictable, so mysterious! 
 God of miracles... 
 Man and woman, once in love, 
 Now her sad heart is shaking. 
 Crying in the dark alone, 
 Crying out for help! 
 And counselors will listen long, 
 And care so very much, 
 But it is not enough, 
 It is not enough! 
 God of miracles, come and be with us, 
 We will trust in you, do your work in us! 
 Kind and noble King, kneeling in the dust: 
 So predictable, so mysterious! 
 God of miracles... 
 Your voice is powerful, 
 Nothing is difficult, 
 You can do what we cannot! 
 Your grace is beautiful, stronger when we are small, 
 You are God, 
 You are God! 
 God of miracles, come and be with us, 
 We will trust in you, to deliver us! 
 Kind and noble King, kneeling in the dust: 
 So magnificent, so mysterious! 
 God of miracles! 
 God of miracles, come be with us, 
 God of miracles! 
 Kind and noble King, kneeling in the dust: 
 So magnificent, so mysterious! 
 God of miracles...

The lonliness is bitter 
 They tell me you have known 
 No parents and no children 
 No one to call you home 
 I pray for you a family 
 Within the Father's plan 
 But even more 
 I pray that you will come to understand 
 That He is a light in the deepest shadow 
 And the wings of a spirit in flight 
 He is a stream in the dry 
 Burning desert 
 He is a song in the longest night 
 There is a holy kinship 
 That you tell me you have known 
 But in the rush of serving 
 You wonder where it's gone 
 I pray you will remember 
 A younger heart's desire 
 I pray that He will blow upon 
 The embers of this fire 
 He is the dearest friend 
 While others come and go 
 He is the dearest friend 
 That you will ever know 
 May you ever know 
 ...Coda... 
 He is a song 
 He is a song 
 He is a song in the longest... night.

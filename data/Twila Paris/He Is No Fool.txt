There once was a man born of high circumstance 
 Heir to advantage, He had every chance to succeed 
 But light from the cross made his dreams appear small 
 And to their surprise he went far--from it all 
 For the love of his Savior, for one priceless jewel 
 They could not understand so they called him a fool 
 He is no fool 
 If he would choose 
 To give the thing he cannot keep 
 To buy what he can never lose 
 To see a treasure in one soul 
 That far outshines the brightest gold 
 He is no fool, He is no fool 
 He is no fool, He is no fool 
 There once was a boy who could run like the wind 
 Given to lead, every man was his friend at the line 
 But light from the cross made his race appear small 
 And to their amazement, he followed the call 
 For the love of his Savior, for one priceless jewel 
 They could not understand so they called him a fool 
 Show me the fool who abandons his life 
 To walk in the steps of our Lord Jesus Christ

He gives to His Beloved even in their sleep 
 He pours his hope and wisdom from streams that run so deep 
 He promises to help them His promise He will keep 
 He gives to His Beloved even in their sleep 
 He sings to His Beloved songs of peace and rest 
 He loves His little children and gives them all the best 
 And those who learn to trust Him forever will be blest 
 He sings to His Beloved songs of peace and rest 
 He sings to His Beloved songs of peace and rest 
 Sleep, Sleep, Beloved

Hold me Close 
 I am weak on my own, blind all alone, 
 I know it's true 
 You lead me in Your way, give me this day, 
 I need You, my only Shephard 
 Hold me close, hold me near 
 When You speak, I will hear 
 Hear Your voice, strong and true 
 Hold me close to You 
 You save me from myself 
 Without Your help, what would I do 
 Fill me up with Your grace 
 Show me Your face 
 I need You, my only Savior 
 Never let me go, dear Father 
 Never let me go 
 I will stay with You forever, 
 Never let me go

Every little baby comes into the world 
 Reaching for an anchor, fingers tightly curled 
 Grasping for a reason without knowing why 
 We will cling to anything 'til the day we die 
 We can hold on to sorrow, hold on to pain 
 We can hold on to anger when there is nothing to be gained 
 We can hold to a thread at the end of a rope 
 But if we hold on to Jesus we are holding on to hope 
 Hold on, hold on 
 This is human nature; this is what He planned 
 When He put our hearts inside, when He made these hands 
 We are here to reach for Him, never letting go 
 This is all we need to have, all we need to know 
 We can hold on to money, hold on to fame 
 We can hold on to glory and the honor of a name 
 We can hold to a thread at the end of a rope 
 But if we hold on to Jesus we are holding on to hope 
 Hold on, hold on 
 Go on hold on, hold on

How Beautiful the hands that served 
 The Wine and the Bread and the sons of the earth 
 How beautiful the feet that walked 
 The long dusty roads and the hill to the cross 
 How Beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ 
 How Beautiful the heart that bled 
 That took all my sin and bore it instead 
 How beautiful the tender eyes 
 That choose to forgive and never despise 
 How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ 
 And as He lay down His life 
 We offer this sacrifice 
 That we will live just as He died 
 Willing to pay the price 
 Willing to pay the price 
 How Beautiful the radiant bride 
 Who waits for her Groom with His light in her eyes 
 How Beautiful when humble hearts give 
 The fruit of pure lives so that others may live 
 How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ 
 How beautiful the feet that bring 
 The sound of good news and the love of the King 
 How Beautiful the hands that serve 
 The wine and the bread and the sons of the Earth 
 How Beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ

I am ready to be 
 All You've given me to be 
 Lord 
 I offer You my pride 
 Lay it down 
 Where I have been bound 
 Father come and set me free 
 I am ready now to be finally -- me 
 I am ready to be 
 All You've given me to be 
 Lord 
 I offer You my life 
 Lay it down 
 Where I have been bound 
 Father come and set me free 
 I am ready now to be 
 Finally, faithfully, willingly -- me

The day can be so long 
 Temptation growing strong 
 To lay the struggle down 
 And tremble in defeat 
 Then rising up in me 
 The courage to believe 
 You lift me tenderly 
 To face the enemy 
 For You have overcome the world 
 And You have come to live in me 
 And in Your name 
 And in Your power 
 I can do all things 
 The danger here is real 
 From one who come to steal 
 The freedom and the life 
 You have given me 
 So I will cling to You 
 Your promise will be true 
 You are my solid rock 
 You are my victory 
 Through Christ who strengthens me 
 I can do all things 
 Through Christ who strengthens me 
 I can do all things

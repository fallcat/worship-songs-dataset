All alone in my own self will 
 Old familiar story 
 So determined to try until I fail 
 You've been waiting as I learn again 
 Straining to the pressure 
 And you offer me a better way 
 Hear me pray 
 Hear me say 
 I choose grace, I choose mercy 
 I choose love and all it means 
 I choose grace, 'cause I need the power 
 And I need to walk in humility 
 Just how often have I let You down 
 And all the hope around me 
 Break a gentle heart along with mine 
 You keep holding out Your arms again 
 Just the way you found me 
 And you carry me across another line 
 Hear me cry 
 No more pride 
 I am growing weary of this foolish independence 
 I reach out for grace and I will reach out to extend it 
 I will reach out 
 I will reach out 
 I will reach out 
 Teach me to walk in humility

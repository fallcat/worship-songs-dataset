I look on the outside 
 You look on the heart 
 Where I see an ending 
 You can see another place to start 
 And every time I see Your hand reach down 
 I know a lonely child has just been found 
 But I never get used to what You do 
 I never get used to watching You 
 Take a life beyond redemption 
 Make it yours and make it new 
 I never outgrow the miracle 
 A heart that was empty flowing full 
 I never get used to what You do 
 I grew up surrounded by 
 The Family of Life 
 You'd think I would know by now 
 You'd think I would never be surprised 
 But every time it takes my breath away 
 And I think it is time You heard me say 
 I never get used to what You do 
 I never get used to watching You 
 Take a life beyond redemption 
 Make it yours and make it new 
 I never outgrow the miracle 
 A heart that was empty flowing full 
 I never get used to what You do 
 Father of grace and love without end 
 God of forgiveness, Faithful Friend 
 Every time I see your hand reach down 
 Another lonely child has just been found 
 Every day Your mercy is brand new 
 And we would all be lost if not for You 
 I never get used to what You do 
 I never get used to watching You 
 Take a life beyond redemption 
 Make it yours and make it new 
 I never outgrow the miracle 
 A heart that was empty flowing full 
 I never get used to what You do 
 I never get used to what You do

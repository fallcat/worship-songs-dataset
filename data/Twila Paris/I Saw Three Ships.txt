I saw three ships come sailing in 
 On Christmas day, on Christmas day 
 I saw three ships come sailing in 
 On Christmas day, in the morning 
 O, they sailed into Bethlehem 
 On Christmas day, on Christmas day 
 O, they sailed into Bethlehem 
 On Christmas day, in the morning 
 The Lord was born in Bethlehem 
 On Christmas day, on Christmas day 
 The Lord was born in Bethlehem 
 On Christmas day, in the morning 
 And all the bells on earth shall ring 
 On Christmas day, on Christmas day 
 And all the bells on earth shall ring 
 On Christmas day, in the morning 
 And all the bells in heaven shall ring 
 On Christmas day, on Christmas day 
 And all the bells in heaven shall ring 
 On Christmas day, on Christmas day 
 On Christmas day

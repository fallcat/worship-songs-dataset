Every day I hear it evil is abroad 
 Making even children enemies of God 
 Yet somehow I always find above the crowd 
 Other voices pleading, crying truth aloud 
 And I don't know your name 
 But I think I see your face 
 I see you standing in the fire 
 Standing on the Word remembering the call 
 I see you standing, standing 
 I see you standing tall 
 In the dire struggle you have held your ground 
 Wisdom and the passion form a mighty sound 
 Thunder in the distance, you are not alone 
 Winds of courage rushing from the righteous throne 
 And I don't know your name 
 But I can see your face 
 You're bringin' hope inside my heart 
 And motion to my feet 
 I know my friend that someday we will meet 
 And I don't know your name 
 But I can see your face

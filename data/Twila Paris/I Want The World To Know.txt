You are bread where there is hunger 
 In the desert You are thunder 
 You are all we need, all we need 
 You are peace where men would riot 
 In the turmoil there is quiet 
 You are all we need, all we need 
 I want the world to know 
 There is one shining hope 
 I want the world to know You 
 To the broken You bring healing 
 To the heart of stone revealing 
 You are all we need, all we need 
 You are friendship to the lonely 
 The forever one and only 
 You are all we need, all we need 
 I want the world to know 
 The story must be told 
 I want the world to know the Truth 
 I want the world to know 
 There is one shining hope 
 I want the world to know You 
 You are love where there is hatred 
 You are life and You are sacred 
 You are all we need, all we need 
 I want the world to know 
 The story must be told 
 I want the world to know the Truth 
 I want the world to know 
 There is one shining hope 
 I want the world to know You

Hard as it seems 
 Standing in dreams 
 Where is the dreamer now 
 Wonder if I 
 Wanted to try 
 Would I remember how 
 I don't know the way to go from here 
 But I know that I have made my choice 
 And this is where I stand 
 Until He moves me on 
 And I will listen to His voice 
 This is the faith 
 Patience to wait 
 When there is nothing clear 
 Nothing to see 
 Still we believe 
 Jesus is very near 
 I can not imagine what will come 
 But I've already made my choice 
 And this is where I stand 
 Until He moves me on 
 And I will listen to His voice 
 Could it be that He is only waiting there to see 
 If I will learn to love the dreams that He has dreamed for me 
 Can't imagine what the future holds 
 But I've already made my choice 
 And this is where I stand 
 Until He moves me on 
 And I will listen to His voice

So many people we know 
 And even more that we don't 
 Have decided "together" is worse than "alone" 
 And I believe it is time 
 That I am taking a stand 
 Love, I gave you my word when I gave you my hand 
 And I haven't the right to tear us apart 
 To break this vow, to break His heart 
 I will never go 
 I will never go 
 I want you to know 
 I will never go 
 And so with tears in their eyes 
 They turn and stumble away 
 But they cannot be alone in the price that they pay 
 I gave a promise to you 
 We took a vow before Him 
 A solemn covenant shared with family and friends 
 And I haven't the right to tear us apart 
 To break this vow, to break His heart 
 I understand that crazy things can happen 
 I understand that life can take a toll 
 I know how it can hurt to keep a promise 
 But man-made options only scar a soul

I will wait on the Lord 
 I will wait for His word 
 Because I fear His holy name 
 I will wait 
 I will wait 
 I will wait on the Lord 
 I will wait for His word 
 Before I move 
 Before I speak 
 Perfect wisdom I will seek 
 And I will wait 
 As long as it takes 
 I will wait on the Lord 
 I will wait on the Lord

I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 While I have life 
 While I have breath 
 While I have life 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 For He is good 
 And He is just 
 And while I have life 
 I will worship my God 
 Then I will abide in His temple forever 
 To sing of His power and glory 
 To stand in the light with the faithful forgiven 
 Sing of His unending love 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 He is my rock 
 He is my strength 
 And while I have life 
 I will worship my God 
 Then I will abide in His temple forever 
 To sing of His power and glory 
 To stand in the light with the faithful forgiven 
 Sing of His unending love 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 While I have life 
 While I have breath 
 While I have life 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 In the land of the living 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 In the land of the living 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 In the land of the living 
 I will worship my God 
 I will worship my God 
 In the land of the living

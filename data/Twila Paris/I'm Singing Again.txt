So often when I'm tryin' hard to fit the plan 
 To my surprise I find I've fallen once again 
 I cry to You and You explain so patiently 
 That my weakness shows Your pow'r so everyone can see 
 Your love is livin' in me 
 Believin' in You is makin' me free 
 And when I don't know where to begin 
 I feel You takin' my hand and then 
 I'm singin' again 
 And so I'm happy bein' all that I can be 
 Anything that I cannot do I know that You can do it through me 
 Even in the hardest times you never fail to bring me a song 
 You let me know that when I'm weak then I am strong 
 Your love is livin' in me 
 Believin' in You is makin' me free 
 And when I don't know where to begin 
 I feel You takin' my hand and then 
 I'm singin' again 
 Singin' again 
 I'm singin' again 
 I'm singin' again 
 I'm singin' again 
 I'm singin' again 
 He's takin' my hand 
 I'm singin' again 
 His love is livin' in me 
 I'm singin' again

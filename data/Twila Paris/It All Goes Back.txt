We're given more than we could earn 
 A carryover from the past 
 But are we able to discern the source of legacy amassed 
 Heritage is free 
 Through a family 
 Servant dynasty 
 It is beautiful to me 
 And it all goes back to You 
 Anything I do 
 I know enough to know 
 I'm nothing on my own 
 It all goes back to You 
 And it all goes back to You 
 All that I come to 
 I know where I began 
 I own you what I am 
 It all goes back to You 
 We are the planting of our Lord 
 The painful labour of Your hand 
 Only to You is the reward for living roots on which we stand 
 Heritage is free 
 Branches on a tree 
 Evergreen indeed 
 It is beautiful to me 
 And it all goes back to You 
 Anything I do 
 I know enough to know 
 I'm nothing on my own 
 It all goes back to You 
 And it all goes back to You 
 All that I come to 
 I know where I began 
 I own you what I am 
 It all goes back to You 
 Heritage is free 
 Through a family 
 Servant dynasty 
 It is beautiful to me 
 And it all goes back to You 
 Anything I do 
 I know enough to know 
 I'm nothing on my own 
 It all goes back to You 
 And it all goes back to You 
 All that I come to 
 I know where I began 
 I own you what I am 
 It all goes back to You 
 I know enough to know 
 I'm nothing on my own 
 It all goes back to You 
 I know where I began 
 I own you what I am 
 It all goes back to You

Sailing on the crest of a wave 
 Riding high 
 Feeling proud, so strong and so brave 
 Ready to fly 
 Looking through rose-colored glasses, I see 
 I can be all that I want me to be 
 It's so easy to love You 
 It's so easy when the sun is always coming my way 
 It's so easy to love You 
 It's so easy when I'm winning every game that I play 
 Oh, Lord, it's so easy when I'm up 
 But help me love You when I'm down 
 Funny how the change of the tide 
 Slows me down 
 All at once, I'm looking inside 
 Turning around 
 Bringing my heart into focus again 
 I need the hard times to see where I've been 
 'Cause it's so easy to love You 
 It's so easy when the sun is always coming my way 
 It's so easy to love You 
 It's so easy when I'm winning every game that I play 
 Oh, Lord, it's so easy when I'm up 
 But help me love You when I'm down 
 I will love You through the changing weather 
 Even through the shattered dreams 
 I have never loved You any better 
 Than I loved You when 
 My heart was tearin' at the seams 
 It's so easy to love You 
 It's so easy when the sun is always coming my way 
 It's so easy to love You 
 It's so easy when I'm winning every game that I play 
 Oh, Lord, it's so easy when I'm up 
 But help me love You when I'm down

And a loving thought sends us out to find 
 Something special for someone on our mind 
 And we think of friends and family 
 As we hang our gifts on the Christmas tree 
 It's the thought that counts when the thought is love 
 It's the thought that counts when you're thinking of 
 How the money flows in vast amounts 
 When the thought is love it's the thought that counts 
 And a loving thought sent a snow white lamb 
 To a little town known as Bethlehem 
 And the little lamb thought of you and me 
 As He hung His gift on the Christmas tree 
 It's the thought that counts when the thought is love 
 It's the thought that counts when you're thinking of 
 How the money flows in vast amounts 
 It's the thought that counts when the thought is love 
 Think of the precious gift He gave 
 Think of the life He thought to save 
 And the blood flowed in vast amounts 
 When the thought is love, it's the thought that counts 
 When the thought is love, it's the thought that counts 
 When the thought is love, it's the thought that counts

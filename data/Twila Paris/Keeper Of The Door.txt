I dreamed I saw my name in lights 
 And spoke your word for all to hear. 
 I dreamed my name was recognized- 
 By people far; 
 By people near. 
 But I have come to understand; 
 Like David long ago, 
 That humble service in your house 
 Is still the greatest dream a heart can know. 
 Oh - let me be a servant 
 A keeper of the door. 
 My heart is only longing 
 To see forevermore 
 The glory of your presence; 
 The dwelling of the Lord. 
 Oh - let me be a servant 
 A keeper of the door. 
 The one who was no less than God 
 To calm the flesh of lowly men 
 And came to wash the feet of clay 
 Because it was his holy plan. 
 And I no greater than my king 
 Would ever seek a place 
 Of humble service in your house 
 To gaze into the light that is your face.

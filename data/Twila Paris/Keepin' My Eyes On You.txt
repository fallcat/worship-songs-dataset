I'm not looking behind me 
 At mistakes I've already made 
 Hope is living inside me 
 I believe that my debts are paid 
 Trusting You now 
 I know I can make it 
 I made a vow 
 I don't want to break it 
 Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You, following You 
 My Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You 
 Following You, my Lord 
 There's no good in comparing 
 With my friends who are serving You 
 Lord, all the grace that You're sharing 
 Is enough for what I must do 
 Trusting You now 
 I know I can make it 
 I made a vow 
 And I'm not gonna break it 
 Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You, following You 
 My Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You 
 Following You, my Lord 
 I won't look to the left or right 
 My only goal is keeping You in my sight 
 Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You 
 Following You, my Lord 
 Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You, following You 
 My Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You, following You 
 My Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You, I'm just following You 
 My Lord, I'm keeping my eyes on You 
 Following You 
 I'm just following You, my Lord

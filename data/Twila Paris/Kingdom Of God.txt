The kingdom of God shall have no end 
 A kingdom of love that is build in our hearts 
 And not by our hands 
 The kingdom of God shall have no end 
 This shining, magnificent glorious kingdom 
 Forever shall stand 
 Thine is the kingdom 
 Thine is the power 
 Thine is the glory forever 
 Thine is the kingdom 
 Thine is the power 
 Thine is the glory forever 
 The kingdom of God forever shall stand 
 The kingdom of God forever amen 
 The kingdom of God

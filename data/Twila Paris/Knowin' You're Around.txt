Before the pain could die 
 I had to learn to cry 
 Tears were trapped behind a frozen stare 
 I kept it all inside 
 I took my life in stride 
 It's not easy to share when there's no one to care 
 But Your love was so strong 
 Gently proved I was wrong 
 It's so good to know You're always there 
 You hold me when I'm lonely 
 You take away the pain 
 You have never let me down 
 And oh if I could only be able to explain 
 The way it makes me feel just knowin' You're around 
 You made it clear to me 
 That You'd be near to me 
 When You said that You would never leave 
 Still every now and then 
 I feel alone again 
 It's so easy to be 
 Feelin' sorry for me 
 But when You take my hand 
 Somehow I understand 
 That Your love is all I really need 
 You hold me when I'm lonely 
 You take away the pain 
 You have never let me down 
 And oh if I could only be able to explain 
 The way it makes me feel just knowin' You're around 
 The way it makes me feel just knowin' You're around

Your only Son no sin to hide 
 But You have sent Him from Your side 
 To walk upon this guilty sod 
 And to become the Lamb of God 
 Your gift of love they crucified 
 They laughed and scorned Him as He died 
 The humble King they named a fraud 
 And sacrificed the Lamb of God 
 Oh Lamb of God, Sweet Lamb of God 
 I love the Holy Lamb of God 
 Oh wash me in His precious Blood 
 My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God 
 I was so lost I should have died 
 But You have brought me to Your side 
 To be led by Your Staff and Rod 
 And to be call a lamb of God 
 Oh wash me in His precious Blood 
 My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

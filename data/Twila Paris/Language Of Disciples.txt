Language of Disciples 
 Conversation day and night 
 Talking to each other 
 Filling every room with light 
 Talking to each other 
 Holding up the weary on 
 Speaking with a gracious tongue 
 Idle chatter left undone 
 Talking to each other 
 Language of Disciples, tell me do you speak it? 
 Do you understand the language of the Spirit? 
 Don't betray an accent foreign to the Kingdom 
 Dialect of Heaven; language of Disciples 
 Language of Disciples 
 Many precious hours spent 
 Talking to each other 
 Keeping wisdom evident 
 Talking to each other 
 Letting accusation rest 
 Edifying lips are blessed 
 Talking to each other 
 You can learn it from the Master 
 Make an honest choice 
 You can learn it even faster 
 Listen to His voice

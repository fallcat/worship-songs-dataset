Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 What a fellowship 
 What a joy divine 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 What a blessedness 
 What a peace is mine 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Safe and secure from all alarm 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Oh, how sweet to walk 
 In this pilgrim way 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Oh, how bright the path 
 Grows from day to day 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Safe and secure from all alarm 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 What have I to dread? 
 What have I to fear? 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 I have blessed peace 
 With my Lord so near 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Safe and secure from all alarm 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Safe and secure from all alarm 
 Leaning, leaning 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms

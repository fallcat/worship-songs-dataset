A crown is heavy you could fall beneath the weight, 
 Consider carefully before you abdicate, 
 The King has give you responsibility, 
 And when you wear it you wear his authority. 
 Let no man take it, let no man take it, 
 Let no man take it, let no man take it, 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Till at his feet you lay it down, 
 May you be ever faithful found, 
 Let no man take your crown. 
 If I'm unwilling to make sure the job is done, 
 Then I can tell the King to find another one, 
 Who will be diligent to carry out the plan, 
 Let us determine to except every command. 
 Let no man take it, let no man take it, 
 Let no man take it, let no man take it, 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Till at his feet you lay it down, 
 May you be ever faithful found, 
 Let no man take your crown. 
 He had a reason for choosing you, 
 You have a reason to follow through. 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Till at his feet you lay it down, 
 May you be ever faithful found, 
 Let no man take your crown. 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Let no man take your crown, 
 Let no man take your crown.

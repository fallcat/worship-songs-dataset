Lord, Your name is above any other name 
 And forever will remain 
 So let the words of my mouth 
 And the thoughts in my heart 
 Let them praise your name 
 Lord, Your throne is above any other throne 
 And forever will remain 
 So let the young and the old 
 Let the high and the low 
 Let them praise, let them praise 
 Let them praise your name 
 Lord, Your love is above any other love 
 And forever will remain 
 So let us go with Your Word 
 To the ends of the earth 
 And let them praise, let them praise 
 Let them praise Your name

Give him glory, all ye princes 
 Give him glory, all ye kings 
 Bow before him, all ye mountains 
 Every river, every stream 
 His name is lifted higher, higher than any other, 
 His name is lifted higher, higher than any other name 
 Hear the wonder, in the story, 
 See the passion, and beyond 
 Let his people, give him glory 
 Every nation, every heart 
 Higher (higher) (7x) 
 Your name is lifted higher, higher than any other, 
 Your name is lifted higher, higher than any other name 
 (2x)

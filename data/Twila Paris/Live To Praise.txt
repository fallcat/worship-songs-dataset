You made me out of dust and breath 
 And I will live to praise You. 
 You saved me from a certain death 
 And I will live to praise You 
 The more I look, the more I see 
 There is no higher goal for me 
 You are my King, You are my Lord 
 I will praise you 
 You are my hope, You are my source 
 I will praise You 
 And I will lift Your name up high 
 You are my God, You are my Life 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You 
 All that I am You give to me 
 And I will live to praise You 
 You made me new You made me free 
 And I will live to praise You 
 The more I seek the more I find 
 The perfect love in Your Design 
 You are my King, You are my Lord 
 I will praise You 
 You are my hope, You are my source 
 I will praise You 
 And I will lift Your name up high 
 You are my God, You are my Life 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You 
 And I will lift Your name up high 
 You are my God, You are my Life 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You 
 You are my King, You are my Lord 
 I will praise You 
 You are my hope, You are my source 
 I will praise You 
 And I will lift Your name up high 
 You are my God, You are my Life 
 I will praise You 
 I will praise You

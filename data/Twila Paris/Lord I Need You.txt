Lord I need you 
 I want to please you 
 In everything I say, in everything I do 
 Make me holy, for your glory 
 A living sacrifice, accepted in my savior's eyes 
 This is my heart, this is my cry 
 "Lord, I love you. Lord I need you" 
 Lord I need you 
 I want to please you 
 In everything I say, in everything I do 
 Make me holy, for your glory 
 A living sacrifice, accepted in my savior's eyes 
 This is my heart, this is my cry 
 "Lord, I love you. Lord I need you" 
 I love you with all my heart 
 I love you with all my soul 
 I love you with all my heart 
 I love you with all my soul 
 I love you with all my heart 
 I love you with all my soul 
 With all my mind, with all my strength 
 Make me holy, for your glory 
 A living sacrifice, accepted my savior's eyes 
 This is my heart, this is my cry 
 "Lord, I love you. Lord I need you"

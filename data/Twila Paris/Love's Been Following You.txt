I know sometimes it's hard to believe it 
 But Love's been following you 
 From where I stand I'm able to see it 
 And Love's been following you 
 All through the stormy night 
 Didn't you see the light 
 Goodness and mercy right there behind you 
 Love's been following you 
 Some days your heart just couldn't be colder 
 But Love's been following you 
 All you have earned just make you feel older 
 But Love's been following you 
 You think that no one cares 
 Still Love is always there 
 He would go anywhere just to find you 
 Love's been following you 
 Love has been following you 
 Love's been following you 
 Love has been following you 
 Following you 
 Following you 
 Somehow the road just seems to get longer 
 But Love's been following you 
 Wait for the One who will make you stronger 
 'Cause Love's been following you 
 Wherever you go from here 
 Run far away from fear 
 Keep one thing very near and believe it's true 
 Love's been following you 
 Love's been following you 
 Love's been following you

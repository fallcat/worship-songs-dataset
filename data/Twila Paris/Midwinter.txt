In bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan 
 Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone 
 Snow had fallen, snow on snow on snow 
 In the bleak midwinter, long ago 
 Our God, heav'n cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain 
 Heav'n and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign 
 In the bleak midwinter, a stable place sufficed 
 The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ 
 What can I give Him, poor as I am 
 If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb 
 If I were a wine man, I would do my part 
 Yet, what I can, I give Him, give my heart

Faster now than ever, I run to You 
 Now I know You better, I run to You 
 I am a little older now, You know it's true 
 Maybe a little wiser, too, I run to You 
 And I can see deeper than I did before 
 I do believe, never have I been so sure 
 That I need You every minute, every day 
 That I need You more than I could ever say 
 Ooh, I run to You 
 Ooh, what else would I do? 
 I run to You, ooh, I run to You 
 Ooh 
 Even on the sad days, I run to You 
 Even on the good days, too, I run to You 
 Even before all else fails, You know it's true 
 You are the wind in my sails, I run to You 
 And I can see deeper than I did before 
 I do believe, never have I been so sure 
 That I need You every footstep, all the way 
 That I need You so much more than I can say

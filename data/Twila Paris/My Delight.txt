When I learn to listen 
 Follow where You lead 
 You will keep me satisfied 
 Give me what I need 
 My Delight 
 You are my delight 
 I think about you day and night 
 You are my delight 
 When I learn to love you 
 Keep my heart on fire 
 You will be my everything 
 All that I desire 
 My Delight 
 You are my delight 
 I think about you day and night 
 You are my delight 
 I will wait to hear your voice 
 I will look into your eyes 
 I could search around the world 
 And never find a greater prize 
 My Delight 
 You are my delight 
 I think about you day and night 
 You are my delight

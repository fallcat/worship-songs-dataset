I heard your name today. 
 I heard you made the old mistake again 
 And it hit me hard. 
 I really thought this time 
 I thought that you would somehow find a way 
 To meet the faith I had in you 
 And I confess I almost lost that faith today 
 But I was wrong, so wrong... 
 'Cause He will never give up on you 
 And neither will I, neither will I 
 Know that we still believe in you 
 And if you will try, if you will try again 
 He will never give up on you 
 And neither will I, neither will I, my friend. 
 I heard your name today. 
 I heard it from a wiser voice inside 
 And it broke my heart. 
 I got down on my knees 
 Reminded that the Father of your soul 
 Has been the One to care the most. 
 And He is there to lift you up and hold you close 
 His love is strong, so strong... 
 Keep walking on and keep on looking straight ahead 
 And when you feel like turning back 
 Turn to Him instead

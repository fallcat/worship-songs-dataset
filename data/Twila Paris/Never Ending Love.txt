I am here to confess the same old thing 
 How can He still be listening 
 How many times will He forgive 
 Rescue me from the way I live 
 What does it take 
 To weave a net that will not break 
 Everlasting, never ending love without condition 
 Everlasting, never ending, never ending love 
 It can seem every time you turn around 
 Somebody else has let you down 
 How many times must we forgive 
 Following Him, how should we live 
 What does it take 
 To weave a net that will not break 
 Love that chose to die for those 
 Who don't deserve to live 
 As we are forgiven 
 So must we forgive 
 Love is never ending, Love is never ending 
 Love is ever forgiving, Never ending love

The Lord does not delight in human reckoning 
 He offers us the wisdom of the spirit 
 The idols of an age are falling all around 
 But we are told to stand and not to fear it 
 We find our strength in him alone 
 We have no greatness of our own 
 We put no confidence in the flesh 
 We will trust in the Lord our God 
 We put no confidence in the flesh 
 We will trust in the Lord our God 
 And we will shine like the stars 
 We will shine like the stars 
 In a darkened world 
 We turn away from hoping in chariot and horse 
 We come aside to listen and to wait 
 The one who brought us here will speak and lead us on 
 Go forward on a path of simple faith 
 We will find our strengths in Him alone 
 We have no greatness of our own 
 Shine, shine, shine 
 Shine, shine 
 In a darkened world

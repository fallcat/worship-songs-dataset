When you think your dream is dying 
 He has not forgotten you 
 When your body aches from tryin' 
 He has not forgotten you 
 When you worry for tomorrow 
 Even though the sky is blue 
 See the sun is shining 
 He has not forgotten you 
 When July feels like December 
 He has not forgotten you 
 When it's painful to remember 
 He has not forgotten you 
 When it seems you can not win 
 And there is not much left to lose 
 He has got a plan 
 And He has not forgotten you 
 He is faithful 
 He is with you 
 He is listening 
 He is love 
 If your tired flesh has squandered 
 What your spirit would have saved 
 And your aimless feet have wandered 
 Far from all you truly crave 
 Turn and run toward your Father 
 Do not wait another day 
 See His arms are open 
 And He is calling out your name 
 And hope will spring eternal 
 In the homes of those who know 
 That loving arms will follow 
 Every where we go 
 And even in the darkness 
 His promises are true 
 Keep this in your heart 
 He has not... forgotten... you.

I am not my own 
 I am bought with a price 
 I am not my own, not my own 
 I am not my own 
 I cannot hold to pride 
 I am not my own, not my own 
 Take this false desire 
 Burn it in Your righteous fire 
 I am not my own, not my own 
 This is not my home 
 This is not Paradise 
 This is not my home, not my home 
 This is not my home 
 I have been far and wide 
 This is not my home, not my home 
 Make this longing true 
 Turn my wistful heart to you 
 This is not my home, not my home 
 When I turn to find Your eyes 
 O Lord, O Lord 
 I begin to realize 
 Once more, once more 
 I am not my own 
 I am bought with a price 
 I am not my own, not my own 
 Take this false desire 
 Burn it in Your righteous fire 
 I am not my own, not my own 
 I am not my own, not my own

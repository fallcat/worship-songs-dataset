He was an independent son, always on the run 
 No time to listen to the Father 
 He stood alone to face the gale, so afraid to fail 
 Afraid to listen to a brother 
 Then suddenly like a memory 
 The candle in his heart burst into flame 
 And patiently, oh so patiently 
 The voice of mercy, truth and light 
 Spoke once again into the night 
 How can this be? 
 What do you see? 
 Nothing but love in its purest form 
 Nothing but love would go into the storm 
 Challenge the pride clouding his eyes 
 Nothing but love could lead him in 
 Nothing but love would do it again 
 Is there an independent son with a heart gone wild? 
 Be still and listen to the Father 
 Underneath the weight you bear, so afraid to share 
 Open the curtain to a brother 
 And suddenly more than memory 
 The candle in your heart can be a flame 
 And patiently, oh so patiently 
 The voice of mercy, truth and light 
 Will speak again into the night 
 How can this be? 
 Who do you see? 
 (What do you see?) 
 (What do you see? What do you see?) 
 Nothing but love in its purest form 
 Nothing but love would go into the storm 
 Challenge the pride clouding your eyes 
 Nothing but love could lead you in 
 Nothing but love would do it again 
 When you fall at his feet 
 And your heart has been humbled and broken 
 Then the God of compassion will reach down His hand 
 And He will lift you up, He will lift you up 
 Nothing but love in its purest form 
 Nothing but love would go into the storm 
 Challenge the pride clouding our eyes 
 Nothing but love could lead us in 
 Nothing but love 
 Nothing but love 
 Nothing but love...(repeat until fade)

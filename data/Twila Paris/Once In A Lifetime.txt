Once in a lifetime we come to this place 
 We are given grace 
 We are given grace 
 Here one decision is made to lean in or away 
 Once in a lifetime this choice is in our hands 
 Here at this crossroads so briefly we stand 
 Once in a lifetime this one given heartbeat goes by 
 Once in a life 
 Once in a lifetime we come to this day 
 We cannot come back 
 We cannot come back 
 We have His Promise to give all the wisdom we lack 
 Once in a lifetime this choice is in our hands 
 Holding one moment between God and man 
 Once in a lifetime this one given heartbeat goes by 
 Once in a life 
 Met and surrounded by mercy so real 
 So real we can taste it 
 Over and over we choose to drink in 
 This love or to waste it 
 Once in a lifetime at this very place 
 We are given grace 
 We are given grace 
 No small decision is made to resist or obey 
 Once in a lifetime this choice in our hands 
 Once in a lifetime and never again 
 Once in a lifetime this one given heartbeat goes by 
 Once in a life

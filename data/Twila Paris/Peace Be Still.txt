There is an ocean surrounding me 
 Mostly the water is calm 
 Just enough breeze to keep me sailin' 
 I feel sage and warm 
 Angry winds blow suddenly 
 How this world can threaten me 
 Then the Master speaks with sure authority 
 Peace be still, Peace be still 
 Peace be still to the wind and the waves 
 Peace be still, Peace be still 
 Peace be still and the ocean obeys 
 There is an ocean inside my heart 
 Mostly the water is calm 
 Just enough breeze to keep me sailin' 
 I feel safe and warm 
 But angry winds blow suddenly 
 And I become a churning sea 
 Then I hear a quiet voice--He says to me 
 Peace be still, Peace be still 
 Peace be still to the wind and the waves 
 Peace be still, Peace be still 
 Peace be still and the ocean obeys 
 Angry winds blow suddenly 
 And I become a churning sea 
 Then I hear a quiet voice--He says to me 
 Peace be still, Peace be still 
 Peace be still to the wind and the waves 
 Peace be still, Peace be still 
 Peace be still and the ocean obeys

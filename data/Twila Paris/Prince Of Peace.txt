There is no hope for a world that denies you 
 Firmly believing a lie 
 Hiding their hearts while their minds analyze you, 
 Cleverly choosing to die 
 Maker of all, we kneel interceding 
 Fighting for your will 
 Father of light 
 Your children are pleading still 
 Prince of Peace, come and reign 
 Set Your feet on the mountaintop again 
 Take Your throne, Rightful Lord 
 Prince of Peace, come and reign forevermore 
 There is no peace for a new generation 
 Living and growing in fear 
 There is no home in a Godless nation 
 Take your authority here 
 Maker of all, we kneel interceding 
 Fighting for Your will 
 Father of light 
 Your children are pleading still 
 Prince of Peace, come and reign 
 Set Your feet on the mountaintop again 
 Take Your throne, Rightful Lord 
 Prince of Peace, come and reign forevermore 
 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done 
 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done 
 Prince of Peace, come and reign 
 Set Your feet on the mountaintop again 
 Take Your throne, Rightful Lord 
 Prince of Peace, come and reign forevermore 
 Prince of Peace, come and reign forevermore

See the insolent man standing on the street 
 Hear the thundering sound of rebellious feet 
 Demanding rights, defending wrong 
 It can bring the righteous blood to boil 
 And we ask, "Oh Lord, how long? 
 Oh, Lord, how long?" 
 This is not the enemy 
 Flesh and blood have been deceived 
 When we move beyond the anger 
 We will see 
 We've got to rescue the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Prisoner of war 
 That's what He came here for 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 In the beautiful land, hear the rivers cry 
 See the innocent ones learning well a lie 
 "There is no right, there is no wrong" 
 It can almost make your blood run cold 
 And we pray, "Lord, make us strong 
 Lord, make us strong" 
 This is not the enemy 
 Jesus died to make them free 
 Love will reach behind the danger 
 Come with me 
 We've got to rescue the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Prisoner of war 
 That's what He came here for 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 We are called to be a light 
 That even blinded eyes can see 
 To break the chains 
 To bind the wounds 
 And to proclaim the captive free 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Pray for the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner 
 Pray for the prisoner 
 Rescue the prisoner

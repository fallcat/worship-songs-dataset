Courier valiant, bearing the flame 
 Messenger noble, sent in His name 
 Faster and harder, run through the night 
 Desperate relay, carry the light 
 Carry the light 
 Runner, when the road is long 
 Feel like giving in but you're hanging on 
 Oh runner, when the race is won 
 You will run into his arms 
 Obstacle ancient, chilling the way 
 Enemy wakened, stoking the fray 
 Still be determined, fearless and true 
 Lift high the standard, carry it through 
 Carry it through 
 Mindful of many waiting to run 
 Destined to finish what you've begun 
 Millions before you cheering you on 
 Godspeed dear runner, carry it home 
 Carry it home

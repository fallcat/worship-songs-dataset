Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Listening every time you cry 
 He delights in you 
 Scattering evil left and right 
 Just to get you through 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Righteous anger flaming 
 Little child reclaiming 
 He is a Father to his own 
 Ever watching you 
 Said, "You will never be alone" 
 Every word is true 
 Call on the Lord who is worthy of praise 
 You will be saved from the enemy 
 He is your Shield and Salvation always 
 You will be saved from the enemy 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Righteous anger burning 
 Victory returning 
 Can you see Him coming? 
 See your Father running 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you 
 Running to the rescue 
 He will come to save you

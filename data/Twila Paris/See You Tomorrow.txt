Early in the morning I open up my eyes 
 Before I even touch the floor I look up to the sky 
 And I say thank you for this day 
 I want to make you happy all day long 
 You are my Father and I love You 
 I'm glad you made the sky so blue 
 You are my God and I will praise you 
 You made the sun rise I'm glad You made me too 
 Last thing in the evening when I am all tucked in 
 And I am thinking peaceful thoughts because of You my friend 
 I say thank you for this day 
 Please forgive the things that I did wrong 
 I'm glad when I am weak but you're so strong 
 You are my Father and I love You 
 I'm glad you made the stars so bright 
 You are my God and I will praise you 
 Before I fall asleep I'd like to say goodnight 
 See You Tomorrow

If I close my ears 
 To the feeble cry 
 Of the poor man's child 
 As he passes by me 
 I can mark Your word 
 There will come a time 
 When my cries will fall 
 On ears like mine 
 Here am I, Lord, send me 
 Here am I, Lord, send me 
 Father in Heaven show Your mercy 
 Send me 
 That his hope should die 
 This was not Your plan 
 You have willed that I 
 Would become Your hands, Lord 
 When I feel Your pain 
 And it fills my eyes 
 When my heart is Yours 
 I will stand and cry 
 Here am I, Lord, send me 
 Here am I, Lord, send me 
 Father in Heaven show Your mercy 
 Send me 
 Send me in a humble spirit 
 Broken for the weaker part 
 Send me where the need is greater 
 Send me with a servant's heart 
 Here am I, Lord, send me 
 Here am I, Lord, send me 
 Father in Heaven show Your mercy 
 Send me, send me, send me, send me

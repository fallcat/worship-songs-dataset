Seventy years ago, my father's mother's father 
 Led the clan of Nicholson 
 He and my great grandmother had four lovely daughters 
 And a strong and honest son 
 And they traveled Arkansas and Oklahoma 
 Building arbors made of vine 
 And the people of the town would come at sundown 
 Some to scoff and some to see what they would find 
 And the sisters dressed in white 
 And the family sang and prayed into the night 
 And they rode in a covered wagon 
 As they walked in holiness 
 And they lived and preached the power 
 And forgiveness of the Lord 
 Seventy years ago 
 Seventy years ago, there wasn't much in preaching 
 But it never slowed them down 
 They loved the truth and all the hearts that He was reaching 
 And their eyes were on the crown 
 So they traveled Arkansas and Oklahoma 
 With a burning in their souls 
 And it drove them to their knees and to the next town 
 For the sake of a wealth they could not hold 
 And the sisters dressed in white 
 And the people sang and prayed into the night 
 And they rode in a covered wagon 
 As they walked in holiness 
 And they lived and preached the power 
 And forgiveness of the Lord 
 Seventy years ago 
 Sometimes I feel like a pale reflection 
 Living in the blessing they passed down 
 Some of whom have held me 
 Some never knew my name 
 But the secret has been found 
 And I want to give this to my children 
 And when I am very old 
 I hope there still will be a story worth the telling 
 Of seventy years ago 
 And they rode in a covered wagon 
 As they walked in holiness 
 And they lived and preached the power 
 And forgiveness of the Lord 
 Seventy years ago 
 Seventy years ago 
 Seventy years ago, my father's mother's father

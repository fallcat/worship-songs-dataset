All I see is that I don't see what's ahead of me 
 I'm afraid my life will never be all I hope for in the end. 
 All I know is that I don't know where the road will go 
 If I dream, then will I find it so - will tomorrow be my friend? 
 Sing me a lullaby, sing me to sleep tonight. 
 Sing me a tender lullaby cause all my heart can do is cry. 
 Help me compose my soul, quietly take control 
 Sing me a lullaby and tell me I'm your child. 
 All my plans are falling through, and I don't understand - yes 
 I know, my world is in your hand, but won't you tell me once again? 
 Sing me a lullaby, sing me to sleep tonight. 
 Sing me a tender lullaby, cause all my heart can do is cry. 
 Help me compose my soul, quietly take control 
 Sing me a lullaby and tell me I'm your child.

Cover the distance, Love in between us 
 When I am cold and afraid 
 You are the secret spoken in silence 
 Keeping the vow You have made 
 You Hold me through sparks and shadows 
 You sing me awake 
 When night fails and my thoughts wonder 
 You stay' I love the way 
 Carry the message deep in the hollow 
 Hide it away underground 
 There is a weary confidence fading 
 When it is lost, I am found 
 The way You keep on tearing down these walls 
 And bringing near the vary far 
 The way You keep this gentle 
 But insistent revolution in my heart 
 I love the way You are 
 You are the only truth in existence 
 Why would I reach for more 
 You are my future, here in my present 
 All that has gone before 
 I love the way 
 Sparks and shadows

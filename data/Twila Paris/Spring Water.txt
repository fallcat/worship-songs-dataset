If you find that you're living 
 In a desert 
 Never fear 
 Even though the earth is hard and dry 
 If you'll share what you've been given 
 New life will appear 
 Soon you'll see a river rushin' by 
 Spring water 
 Coming up from deep inside 
 Spring water 
 Holy Spirit purified 
 He knows how to distill it 
 All you gotta do is let Him spill it all around 
 Spring water 
 You just can't keep it in the ground 
 Pour your life out 
 Go ahead and give it all away 
 You'll get back a lot more than you gave 
 What will be tomorrow's promise 
 Water every day 
 You can only lose the love you've saved.

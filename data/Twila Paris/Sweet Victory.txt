Quietly you lead me to an open place 
 Hold me in the stillness till I see Your face 
 Waiting in the silence as You speak my name 
 Rising like an eagle I will fly 
 Sweet Victory over the enemy 
 Gentle Power, all I ever needed 
 Sweet Victory, I take it finally 
 Strength for running 
 It was a long time coming 
 Sweet Victory 
 In this place I rest in more than I can see 
 High above the turbulence You carry me 
 From deep in a full heart I will speak Your name 
 Rising like an eagle I will fly 
 Sweet Victory over the enemy 
 Gentle Power, all I ever needed 
 Sweet Victory, I take it finally 
 Strength for running 
 It was a long time coming 
 Sweet Victory 
 I held so tightly to my fear 
 There were so many sins repeated 
 But Your love has brought me here 
 And the Victory is sweet 
 Victory is sweet 
 Sweet Victory over the enemy 
 Gentle Power, all I ever needed 
 Sweet Victory, I take it finally 
 Strength for running 
 It was a long time coming 
 Sweet Victory

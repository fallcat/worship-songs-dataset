Tellin' the Truth 
 I believe in telling, telling the truth in love 
 I believe in telling, telling the truth in love 
 I believe in telling, telling the truth in love 
 I believe in telling, telling the truth in love 
 When I really love you, if I really love you 
 I am not afraid to face the fact 
 I could be the mark if you react 
 If I really love you 
 I am not afraid to take the chance 
 This could be a painful circumstance 
 If I really love you, if I really love you 
 When I really love you, if I really love you 
 I'll be there to win my brother back 
 Turn the other cheek if you attack 
 If I really love you 
 I'll be there in broken honesty 
 You are my responsibility 
 If I really love you, if I really love you 
 I believe in telling, telling the truth in love 
 I believe in telling, telling the truth in love 
 When I brother falls 
 Dare to risk it all 
 When I brother sins 
 Go and bring him in

Thank You for keepin' Your hand on me 
 Even when I tried so hard to be free from Your touch 
 You loved me so much that you didn't let go 
 Oh, thank You for keepin' Your hand on me 
 Even when I was busy chasin' rainbows 
 Even then, I knew Your love would follow me 
 What a friend, there is nowhere that I can go 
 Below Thee or above 
 I can't lose Your neverending love 
 Lord, thank You for keepin' Your hand on me 
 Even when I tried so hard to be free from Your touch 
 You loved me so much that you didn't let go 
 Oh, thank You for keepin' Your hand on me 
 Even though it seems that all I do is struggle 
 Even so, I never meant to get away 
 Don't let go, I know I've been a lot of trouble 
 But we know that I'm growin' 
 Oh Lord, I only hope it's showin' 
 Thank You for keepin' Your hand on me 
 Even when I tried so hard to be free from Your touch 
 You loved me so much that you didn't let go 
 Oh, thank You for keepin' Your hand on me 
 Thank You for keepin' Your hand on me 
 Even when I tried so hard to be free from Your touch 
 You loved me so much that you didn't let go 
 Oh, thank You for keepin' Your hand on me

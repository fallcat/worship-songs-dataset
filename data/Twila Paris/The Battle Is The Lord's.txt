The battle is the Lord's 
 And He will conquer all His enemies 
 With His right hand and His holy arm 
 He will obtain 
 He will obtain 
 He will obtain the victory 
 The princes of the earth and of the sky 
 Shall see His holy power 
 His holy power 
 His holy power 
 The battle is the Lord's 
 And He will conquer all His enemies 
 With His right hand and His holy arm 
 He will obtain 
 He will obtain 
 He will obtain the victory 
 Break forth and sing for joy 
 Sing praises to the Lord for He is coming 
 For He is coming 
 For He is coming 
 For He is coming 
 The battle is the Lord's 
 And He will conquer all His enemies 
 With His right hand and His holy arm 
 He will obtain 
 He will obtain 
 He will obtain the victory

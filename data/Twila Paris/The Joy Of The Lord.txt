The joy of the Lord will be my strength 
 I will not falter, I will not faint 
 He is my shepherd; I am not afraid 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 The joy of the Lord 
 The joy of the Lord 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 The joy of the Lord will be my strength 
 He will uphold me all of my days 
 I am surrounded by mercy and grace 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength 
 The joy of the Lord will be my strength 
 I will not waiver, walking by faith 
 He will be strong to deliver me safe 
 The joy of the Lord is my strength

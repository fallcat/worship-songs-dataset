We close our eyes and wonder how much longer 
 The earth can hold the tears of all its children 
 We wonder what became of Eden 
 While we live in the garden we have grown 
 But there will be hope when we finally understand 
 We were never meant to make it on our own 
 The time is now 
 To hear the call 
 From the Father of creation 
 Comes an answer for us all 
 The time is here 
 The time for you 
 If you seek, then you will find Him 
 And the moment that you do 
 Seal your heart with a sacred vow 
 The time is now 
 We look ahead and try to face the future 
 But find we have no heart for this tomorrow 
 There is a vision that is brighter 
 And if we will believe, it's not too late 
 For every decision becomes a destination 
 And today we face a choice that cannot wait 
 The time is now 
 To hear the call 
 From the Father of creation 
 Comes an answer for us all 
 The time is here 
 The time for you 
 If you seek, then you will find Him 
 And the moment that you do 
 Seal your heart with a sacred vow 
 Now is the time and today is the day 
 Now is the time and we cannot delay 
 This is the moment and this is the place 
 For the mercy, the power, the love, and the grace 
 The time is now 
 To hear the call 
 From the Father of creation 
 Comes an answer for us all 
 The time is here 
 The time for you 
 If you seek, then you will find Him 
 And the moment that you do 
 Seal your heart with a sacred vow 
 The time is now 
 The time is now 
 Now is the time and today is the day 
 Now is the time and we cannot delay 
 Now is the time...

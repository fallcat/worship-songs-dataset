Lately I've been winning battles left and right 
 But even winners can get wounded in the fight 
 People say that I'm amazing 
 Strong beyond my years 
 But they don't see inside of me 
 I'm hiding all the tears 
 They don't know that I go running home when I fall down 
 They don't know who picks me up when no one is around 
 I drop my sword and cry for just a while 
 'Cause deep inside this armor 
 The warrior is a child 
 Unafraid because His armor is the best 
 But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest 
 People say that I'm amazing 
 Never face retreat 
 But they don't see the enemies 
 That lay me at His feet 
 They don't know that I go running home when I fall down 
 They don't know who picks me up when no one is around 
 I drop my sword and look up for a smile 
 Because deep inside this armor 
 Deep inside this armor 
 Deep inside this armor 
 The Warrior is a Child

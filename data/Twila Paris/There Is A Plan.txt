It was a very dark time 
 It was a very dark place 
 There was a visible force 
 And an invisible grace 
 I know they must have felt so caught up in the way of things 
 Small and defenseless at the mercy of an evil king 
 Still they rode on to Bethlehem 
 A gentle woman and a righteous man 
 They found an unassuming home 
 And a baby was born 
 And all along 
 There was a plan 
 Moving just beneath the surface of the world we understand 
 It was so small 
 It was so grand 
 And it rose to be the glory and the power in His hand 
 There was a plan 
 It was a very dark time 
 Another very dark place 
 There was an arrogant voice 
 A quiet innocent grace 
 I know they must have felt so trapped inside of circumstance 
 Without a voice and holding next to nothing in their hands 
 And still a sacred strategy 
 Hidden inside the heart said you are free 
 The children sang out in the streets 
 And the walls came down 
 And all along 
 There was a plan 
 Moving just beneath the surface of the world we understand 
 It was so small 
 It was so grand 
 And it rose to be the glory that would cover all the land 
 There was a plan 
 He is working through the night 
 Behind the scenes, behind the eyes 
 Though we would never realize it at a glance 
 When He comes to work in me 
 The building of eternity 
 I pray I do not miss the moment 
 Do not miss the chance 
 Do not miss the chance 
 I still believe 
 There is a plan 
 Moving just beneath the surface of the world we understand 
 It is so small 
 It will be grand 
 It will rise to be the glory that will shine on every man 
 I still believe 
 I still believe 
 There is a plan 
 I still believe 
 I still believe 
 There is a plan 
 I still believe 
 I still believe 
 There is a plan

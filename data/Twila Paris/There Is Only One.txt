One by one 
 We climb the mountain of ambition 
 One by one 
 And we bow at the altar of tradition 
 One by one 
 Somebody tell me what are we building 
 You know the house of cards will tumble 
 Temporary by design 
 And all the schemes of man will crumble 
 Are we wasting precious time 
 Are we wasting precious time 
 Stone by stone 
 We build a kingdom to perfection 
 Stone by stone 
 And we search for our safety and protection 
 In a home 
 Somebody tell me what are we thinking 
 You know the house of cards will tumble 
 Temporary by design 
 And all the schemes of man will crumble 
 Are we wasting precious time 
 When there is only one Kingdom 
 One place to hide 
 Only one Kingdom 
 Come and find a place inside 
 Come and find a place inside 
 Come and find a place inside 
 Because a house of cards will tumble 
 Temporary by design 
 And all the schemes of man will crumble 
 Are we wasting precious time 
 Are we wasting precious time 
 Are we wasting precious time 
 Are we wasting precious time

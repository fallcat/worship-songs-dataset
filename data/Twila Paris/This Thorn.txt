Thank you for this torn embedded in my flesh 
 I can feel the mystery my spirit is made fresh 
 You are sovereign still and forever wise 
 I can see the miracle opening my eyes 
 To a proud heart so quick to judge 
 Laying down crosses and carrying grudges 
 The veil has been torn 
 And I thank you for this thorn 
 Thank you for this thorn fellowship of pain 
 Teaching me to know you more never to complain 
 Thank You for this love planted in my side 
 Faithful patient miracle opening my eyes 
 I never thought I'd say it without reservation 
 But I am truly grateful for this piercing revelation 
 Of a proud heart so quick to judge 
 Laying down crosses and carrying grudges 
 The veil has been torn 
 And I thank you for this thorn 
 And if You chose to take it, I will praise You 
 And thank You for the healing in your name 
 But if it must remain, I thank You for Your rod 
 Evidence of Father-love for a child of God 
 I join you in sorrow 
 So much less than You have borne 
 And I thank you 
 Really I thank You 
 Lord I thank You 
 I thank You for this thorn

This world, this world 
 This old world will never be the same 
 Since the Son of God was born a little baby in Bethlehem 
 This world, this world 
 This old world will never be the same 
 Since the Son of God was born a little baby in Bethlehem 
 Lost world in despair 
 Christ came to answer prayer 
 Peace did the angels sing 
 And presented the earth its newborn king 
 Hated by His own 
 Dying all alone 
 Crucified that day 
 For the sins of the world, He had to pay 
 As in days of yore 
 Teaching by the shore 
 Jesus, speak again 
 To a world that's filled with war and pain 
 Come, oh Christ, our King 
 Peace on earth to bring 
 Come Lord, from above 
 'Cause we'll never know peace till we have Your love 
 This world

Search my heart, make me clean 
 It's your approval I long for 
 Rule my life, be my king 
 Do what you will I belong to you 
 Search my heart, make me clean 
 It's your approval I long for 
 Rule my life, be my king 
 Do what you will I belong to you 
 I will find my hope in you 
 Trusting in no man 
 Leaning not to earthly wisdom 
 Things I understand 
 Hide my heart away 
 Fill me with your mind 
 Let the world forsake me 
 I will find my hope in you 
 I will find my hope in you 
 Trusting in no man 
 Leaning not to earthly wisdom 
 Things I understand 
 Hide my heart away 
 Fill me with your mind 
 Let the world forsake me 
 I will find my hope in you 
 Hide my heart away 
 Fill me with your mind 
 Let the world forsake me 
 I will find my hope in you 
 Lord of my heart, Lord of my heart 
 I offer praise from the shadow of your throne 
 Lord of my heart, Lord of my heart 
 One song I raise in your presence, you alone are Lord 
 Lord of my life, Lord of my life 
 I offer praise from the shadow of your throne 
 Lord of my life, Lord of my life 
 One song I raise in your presence, you alone are Lord 
 Lord of the earth, Lord of the earth 
 We offer praise from the shadow of your throne 
 Lord of of the earth, Lord of of the earth 
 One song we raise in your presence, you alone are Lord

Lord, I believe You will keep Your promise 
 Lord, I believe You will follow through 
 Lord, I believe You will send upon us 
 Power enough so we all can do Your will 
 Until the job has been well done 
 To do Your will 
 Until we know the war is won 
 To do Your will 
 Until You come to take us home 
 To do Your will 
 Lord, I believe You will go before us 
 Lord, I believe You're behind us too 
 Lord, I believe You will never leave us 
 You give us all that we need to do Your will 
 Until the job has been well done 
 To do Your will 
 Until we know the war is won 
 To do Your will 
 Until You come to take us home 
 To do Your will 
 Lord, I believe You will keep Your promise 
 Lord, I believe You will follow through 
 Lord, I believe You will send upon us 
 Power enough that we've got to do Your will 
 Until the job has been well done 
 To do Your will 
 Until we know the war is won 
 To do Your will 
 Until You come to take us home 
 To do Your will 
 To do Your will 
 To do Your will 
 Until the job has been well done 
 To do Your will 
 Until we know the war is won 
 To do Your will 
 Until You come to take us home 
 To do Your will

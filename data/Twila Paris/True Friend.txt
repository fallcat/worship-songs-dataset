Seems like you know when I need you 
 Seems like He knows who to send 
 You never come as a prophet 
 Just an open hearted friend 
 Faithfully wounding my pride 
 Bringing me back to His side 
 Sharing the Word that you hide in your heart 
 You are a true friend 
 Pointing me to Him 
 Lifting my downcast eyes 
 Turning my gaze to the sky 
 Probing your love again 
 You are a true friend 
 You are a true friend 
 Some days I feel like a failure 
 And I'd love to leave it all 
 I see no reason to go on 
 That's when you decide to call 
 Making it simple and clear 
 That's why your voice is so dear 
 My heart takes courage from hearing you say

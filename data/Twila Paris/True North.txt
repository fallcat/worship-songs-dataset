We lost our bearings, 
 Following our own mind 
 We left conviction behind 
 Fear of the future, 
 Springing from the sins of the past 
 Hiding the hope that would last 
 How did we ever wander so 
 Far and where do we go from here? 
 How will we how where it is? 
 True North 
 There's a strong steady light 
 That is guiding us home 
 True North 
 In the lingering night we 
 Were never alone 
 True North 
 We need an absolute 
 Compass now more 
 Than ever before 
 True north, True north 
 Wonders of nature speak 
 To us all of Your plan 
 Why would we run from Your hand 
 Laws of the eart, just like 
 The laws of the heart 
 Only begin where You are 
 How did we ever wander 
 So far and where do we 
 Go from here? 
 How will we find it again? 
 Turning back to where 
 You meet us 
 We will follow where 
 You lead us 
 There is Truth inside 
 Your dwelling 
 We have come to face 
 True North 
 There's a strong steady light 
 That is guiding us home 
 True North 
 In the lingering night we 
 Were never alone 
 True North 
 We need an absolute 
 Compass now more 
 Than ever before 
 True north, True north

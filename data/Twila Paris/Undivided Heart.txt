There have been days when I would die for You 
 And days when I would not die to me 
 There have been nights when I would cry with You 
 For the sins of the world and the pain in the city 
 But some nights I cried only tears of self-pity 
 I need a love that will always endure 
 Give me a love that is simple and pure 
 Give me an undivided heart 
 Place a new spirit in me 
 Give me an undivided heart 
 That I may fear Your name 
 Undivided, undivided heart 
 Undivided, undivided heart 
 Lord, You have seen me giving all that I'm worth 
 But only to find me taking more 
 There are those times when I embrace the earth 
 When I rise to the need and I welcome the labor 
 And then I must fight to forgive my own neighbor 
 I need a love that will always endure 
 Give me a love that is simple and pure 
 Single purpose, single mind, undivided heart 
 Single vision, single mind, undivided heart

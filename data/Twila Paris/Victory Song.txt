Child of God is your head hangin' down 
 Why are you sad? 
 The battle is already won 
 So let your heart be glad 
 Now, if you want to sing a song 
 Don't sing about defeat 
 Let His praises fill your mouth 
 The taste is oh so sweet 
 There's no need for you to fear it 
 Don't you hear the angels singin' along? 
 Go ahead and let the enemy hear it 
 Sing your victory song 
 Singin' Glory (Glory) 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 He has come to set me free 
 Glory (Glory) 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 He has won the victory 
 Lift your head and look above you 
 We are not alone 
 Don't you know the Prince of Peace is still upon the throne? 
 Raise your voice, the battle cries we have overcome 
 Let His praises fill the sky, for Jesus Christ has won 
 Oh, there's no need for you to fear it 
 Don't you hear the angels singin' along? 
 Go ahead and let the enemy hear it 
 Sing your victory song 
 Singin' Glory (Glory) 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 He has come to set me free 
 Glory (Glory) 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 He has won the victory 
 Singin' Glory (Glory) 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 He has come to set us free 
 Glory (Glory) 
 Hallelujah (Hallelujah) 
 He has won the victory 
 He has won the victory 
 He has won the victory

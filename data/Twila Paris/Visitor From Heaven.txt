A visitor from Heaven 
 If only for a while 
 A gift of love to be returned 
 We think of you and smile 
 A visitor from Heaven 
 Accompanied by grace 
 Reminding of a better love 
 And of a better place 
 With aching hearts and empty arms 
 We send you with a name 
 It hurts so much to let you go 
 But we're so glad you came 
 We're so glad you came 
 A visitor from Heaven 
 If only for a day 
 We thank Him for the time He gave 
 And now it's time to say 
 We trust you to the Father's love 
 And to His tender care 
 Held in the everlasting arms 
 And we're so glad you're there 
 We're so glad you're there 
 With breaking hearts and open hands 
 We send you with a name 
 It hurts so much to let you go 
 But we're so glad you came 
 We're so glad you came

Wandering pilgrim, searching alone 
 Weary from travel, so far from home 
 You need a firelight inside you to guide you 
 Oh, wandering pilgrim, look to the wonderful star 
 Wandering pilgrim, please take my hand 
 I've been a pilgrim, I know the land 
 You need an escort beside you to guide you 
 Oh, wandering pilgrim, look to the wonderful star 
 Follow the star in the night 
 Wonderful star of light 
 Wandering pilgrim, be not afraid 
 There is the sign in heaven displayed 
 You need a Savior inside you to guide you 
 Oh, wandering pilgrim, look to the wonderful star 
 Please, let me show you the star 
 Follow that wonderful star

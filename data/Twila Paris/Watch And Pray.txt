The enemy roams 
 Like a roaring lion 
 Looking for the sleeping 
 Looking for the sleeping 
 When he comes here 
 Let him find us keeping our promises 
 Holding to faithfulness 
 Down on our knees, eyes to the east 
 Watch and pray 
 No one knows the moment 
 No one knows the hour 
 Or the day 
 Watch and pray 
 Till you see Him coming 
 Coming through the clouds in white array 
 To take His bride away 
 The King will appear 
 With a shout of glory 
 All the earth awaking 
 All the earth awaking 
 Until He comes 
 Let us keep on taking the highest ground 
 Listening for the sound 
 Down on our knees, eyes to the east 
 Watch and pray 
 No one knows the moment 
 No one knows the hour 
 Or the day 
 Watch and pray 
 Till you see Him coming 
 Coming through the clouds in white array 
 To take His bride away 
 Behold the Bridegroom 
 Behold the Bridegroom 
 He is coming soon 
 Prepare Him room 
 Watch and pray 
 No one knows the moment 
 No one knows the hour 
 Or the day 
 Watch and pray 
 Till you see Him coming 
 Coming through the clouds in white array 
 To take His bride away 
 Watch and pray 
 No one knows the moment 
 No one knows the hour 
 Or the day 
 Watch and pray 
 Till you see Him coming 
 Coming through the clouds in white array 
 To take His bride away 
 Watch and pray 
 Till you see Him coming 
 Coming through the clouds in white array 
 To take His bride away

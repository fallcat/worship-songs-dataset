Princes and paupers 
 Sons and daughters 
 Kneel at the throne of grace 
 Losers and winners 
 Saints and sinners 
 One day will see His face 
 And we all bow down 
 Kings will surrender their crowns 
 And worship Jesus 
 For He is the love 
 Unfailing love 
 He is the love of God 
 Summer and winter 
 The mountains and rivers 
 Whisper our Savior's name 
 Awesome and holy 
 A friend to the lonely 
 Forever His love will reign 
 He's the light of the world 
 And Lord of the cross 
 And we all bow down 
 Kings will surrender their crowns 
 And worship Jesus 
 Worship Jesus 
 Worship Jesus 
 For He is love 
 Unfailing love 
 He is the Love of God

Everyone looks for love 
 So hard to see 
 Hiding around the world 
 Hiding from me 
 One Love is always the way that it seems 
 One Love does not seek its own private dreams 
 This Love is free 
 We know Love 
 Some love is in the air 
 Easy to start 
 Some love is everywhere 
 Hurting some heart 
 One Love would give up itself for a friend 
 One Love is faithful and true till the end 
 This Love is Him 
 By this we know Love 
 By this we know Love 
 That He laid down His life 
 Laid down His life for us 
 We know Love 
 Some love is fragile and easy to break 
 Careless and shallow and so much at stake 
 This Love is not just the way that we feel 
 This Love is powerful fire and steel 
 This Love is real 
 By this we know Love 
 By this we know Love 
 That He laid down His life 
 Laid down His life for us 
 We know Love 
 We know Love and we will live it 
 We know Love and we will give it 
 We know loving arms around us 
 We know Love for Love has found us 
 By this we know Love 
 By this we know Love 
 That He laid down His life 
 Laid down His life for us 
 We know Love 
 We know Love 
 We know Love

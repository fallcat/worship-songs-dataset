The Lord is Mighty 
 The Lord is Holy 
 The Lord is Present in this place 
 And we behold him 
 We see his goodness 
 We know his mercy and his grace 
 We seek his face (4x) 
 The Lord is Risen 
 The Lord is Coming 
 And all the earth shall sing his praise 
 And to behold him 
 In all his glory 
 In all his power and his grace 
 We seek his face (4x) 
 Hallelujah 
 God is With Us 
 Hallelujah 
 Christ is coming

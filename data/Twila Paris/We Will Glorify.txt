We will glorify the King of kings 
 We will glorify the Lamb 
 We will glorify the Lord of lords 
 Who is the great I AM 
 Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty 
 We will bow before His throne 
 We will worship Him in righteousness 
 We will worship Him alone 
 He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth 
 He is Lord of all who live 
 He is Lord above the universe 
 All praise to Him we give 
 Hallelujah to the King of kings 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb 
 Hallelujah to the Lord of Lords 
 Who is the great I AM

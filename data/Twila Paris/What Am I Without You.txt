You are the love of all my life 
 You are the living spring 
 You are the joy that finds my heart 
 Giver of all good things 
 What am I without You? 
 What am I without You? 
 You are the day that rules the night 
 You are the hope in me 
 All that I have descends from You 
 All I could ever be 
 What am I without You? 
 What am I without You? 
 What am I but a piece of earth 
 Breathing holy breath 
 What am I but a wayward child 
 Given life for certain death 
 You are the everlasting Lord 
 You are the risen King 
 That You would come and fill my soul 
 This is beyond a dream 
 What am I without You 
 What am I without You 
 What am I without You 
 What am I without You

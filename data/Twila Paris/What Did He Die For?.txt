He was 21 in 1944, 
 He was hope, and he was courage on a lonely shore. 
 Sent there by a mother, with love beyond her tears, 
 Just a young American who chose to rise above his fears, 
 And as I watch him struggle up that hill, 
 Without a thought of turning back. 
 I cannot help but wonder, 
 What did he die for, when he died for you and me, 
 Made the sacrifice so that we could all be free. 
 I believe that we will the answer each to heaven, 
 For the way we spend a priceless liberty. 
 Look inside and ask the question, 
 What did he die for, when he died for me. 
 To the darkest day in AD 33, 
 Came the mercy and compassion of eternity, 
 Sent there by a Father with love beyond his tears, 
 Blameless one the only son to bear the guilt of all these years, 
 And as I watch him struggle up that hill, 
 Without a thought of turning back, 
 I cannot help but wonder, 
 What did he die for, when he died for you and me, 
 Made the sacrifice so that we could all be free. 
 I believe that we will the answer each to heaven, 
 For the way we spend a priceless liberty. 
 Look inside and ask the question, 
 What did he die for, when he died for me. 
 He died for freedom, 
 He died for love, 
 Of all the things we do to pay him back 
 Could never be enough. 
 I cannot help but wonder, 
 What did he die for, when he died for you and me, 
 Made the sacrifice so that we could all be free. 
 I believe that we will the answer each to heaven, 
 For the way we spend a priceless liberty. 
 Look inside and ask the question, 
 What did he die for, when he died for me. 
 Ooh, ooh

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound 
 And time shall be no more 
 And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair 
 When the saved of earth shall gather 
 Over on the other shore 
 And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there 
 On that bright and cloudless morning 
 When the dead in Christ shall rise 
 And the glory of His resurrection share 
 When His chosen ones shall gather 
 To their home beyond the skies 
 And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 I'll be there, I'll be there 
 So let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun 
 Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care 
 Then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done 
 Then the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 When the roll is called up yonder 
 I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

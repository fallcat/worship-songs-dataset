When You speak to me 
 When I take the time to listen 
 There is more than what I think I feel 
 When You speak to me 
 When I sit and still the motion 
 There is nothing left but what is real 
 There is an answer to every question 
 The answer is You 
 And the heavens open when You speak to me 
 Pouring light into my waiting heart 
 And the music fills an ocean silently, quietly 
 When you speak to me 
 When You speak to me 
 When You call me and surround me 
 There is peace to cover any pain 
 When You speak to me 
 When You place Your word inside me 
 I am filled and I am strong again 
 There is a reason for every longing 
 The reason is You

I see a multitude of people 
 Some far away and some close by 
 They weave together new religion 
 From tiny remnants they have found 
 A bit of truth, a greater lie 
 And all the prophets stand and sing a pleasant song 
 A million cords that bind the spirit growing strong 
 My heart is breaking 
 I must remind them... 
 You are the only way 
 You are the only voice 
 You are the only hope 
 You are the only choice 
 You are the one true God 
 No matter what we say 
 You are the breath of life 
 You are the only way 
 Give us wisdom 
 Give us wisdom 
 There is a moment of decision 
 But all the days go rushing by 
 An undercurrent of confusion 
 To threaten all that we believe 
 With little time to wonder why 
 And all the prophets sing the same familiar song 
 Even the chosen can be led to sing along 
 These hearts are breaking 
 Will you remind us... 
 You are the only way 
 You are the only voice 
 You are the only hope 
 You are the only choice 
 You are the one true God 
 No matter what we say 
 You are the breath of life 
 You are the only way 
 Give us wisdom 
 Give us wisdom 
 You choose the simple things to overcome the wise 
 Wisdom is granted in the name of Jesus Christ 
 In the name of Jesus Christ 
 You are the only way 
 You are the only voice 
 You are the only hope 
 You are the only choice 
 You are the one true God 
 No matter what we say 
 You are the breath of life 
 We need You here today 
 (You are the only way) 
 Give us wisdom 
 Give us wisdom

Looking through this window pane 
 At the world nearby 
 I see nothing there but rain 
 Makes me want to cry 
 How did this circumstance find me 
 Hidden so safely here? 
 What have I done to deserve this truth and these tears? 
 I'm just wondering out loud 
 Underneath the blue and cloud 
 I don't mean to draw a crowd 
 I'm just wondering out loud 
 Then again another day 
 Different point of view 
 Searching higher than before 
 This time I see You 
 How did this miracle find me? 
 Why do You know my name? 
 What have I done to deserve this love anyways? 
 You know I can't say 
 I'm just wondering out loud 
 Could it be that I've been proud 
 Here beneath the blue and cloud 
 I'm just wondering out loud 
 Now I'm driving down the road 
 With great music on the radio 
 And a great big sun in the sky 
 It's good to be alive 
 It's good to be alive 
 And after this, we go to Heaven 
 After this, we go to Heaven 
 Can the joy of life be found in simple gratitude? 
 And is gratitude as simple as perspective? 
 I'm just wondering out loud 
 Underneath the blue and cloud 
 It may be that I've been proud 
 I'm just wondering out loud 
 I don't mean to draw a crowd 
 These are things I think about 
 I'm just wondering out loud 
 I've been wondering out loud

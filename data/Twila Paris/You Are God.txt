You are the Star of the Morning 
 Unending hope in the night 
 One righteous prayer from anywhere 
 Carries the promise of light 
 You are God on the highest mountain 
 You are God in the deepest sea 
 You are awesome in power and glory 
 Great is Your love for me 
 Great is Your love for me 
 You give the wings of an eagle 
 If we are willing to wait 
 One single word forever heard 
 Calls us to rise and not faint 
 You are God on the highest mountain 
 You are God in the deepest sea 
 You are awesome in power and glory 
 Great is Your love for me 
 Great is Your love for me 
 You are God on the highest mountain 
 You are God in the deepest sea 
 You are awesome in power and glory 
 Great is Your love for me 
 You are God on the highest mountain 
 You are God in the deepest sea 
 You are awesome in power and glory 
 Great is Your love for me 
 Great is Your love for me 
 Great is Your love 
 Great is Your love 
 Great is Your love 
 For me

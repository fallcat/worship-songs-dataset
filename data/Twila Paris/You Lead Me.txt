You said: Follow me and I will make you Mine 
 I will make your life come true 
 You said: Trust in Me and I will hold your hand 
 I do, I do 
 You lead me by still waters 
 You lead me through the storm 
 You feed me in green pastures 
 You keep me safe from harm 
 You said: come away and you will know My heart 
 I will build a fire in you 
 I said: I am here and I will dream this dream 
 With You, with you 
 You lead me by still waters 
 You lead me through the storm 
 You feed me in green pastures 
 You keep me safe from harm 
 You lead me (repeat) 
 And daybreak comes with mercy 
 And twilight carries fears 
 And troubles come and troubles go 
 But like the snow Your joy falls around so easy 
 You lead me by still waters 
 You lead me through the storm 
 You feed me in green pastures 
 You keep me safe from harm 
 You lead me (repeat)

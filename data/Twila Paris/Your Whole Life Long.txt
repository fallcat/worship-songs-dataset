I pray the Lord will hold you close and keep you through the night, 
 That you will wake up smiling in the early morning light, 
 That He will always comfort you and make you brave and strong, 
 I pray that you will follow Him your whole life long. 
 I pray that you will grow up to be wise and good and true, 
 I pray that you will please the Lord in everything you do, 
 I pray that you will hear His voice and learn to sing His song, 
 I pray that you will follow Him your whole life long. 
 I pray that you will follow Him, 
 I pray that you will follow Him, 
 I pray that you will follow Him your whole life long. 
 I pray the Lord will bless you with His presence every day, 
 I pray he will protect you every step along the way, 
 Help you love what's right and lead you far away from wrong, 
 I pray that you will follow Him your whole life long. 
 I pray that you will follow Him, 
 I pray that you will follow Him, 
 I pray that you will follow Him your whole life long.

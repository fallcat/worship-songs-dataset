I will abide in You 
 I'll abide in You, O Lord 
 And I'll speak Your words 
 I'll speak Your words, O Lord 
 That's where the promise is 
 That's where the promise is 
 To abide in You 
 O my Lord 
 That's where the promise is 
 That's where the promise is 
 To abide in You 
 I will abide in You 
 I'll abide in You, O Lord 
 And I'll speak Your words 
 I'll speak Your words, O Lord 
 That's where the promise is 
 Where the promise is 
 To abide in You 
 O my Lord 
 That's where the promise is 
 Where the promise is 
 To abide in You 
 Whatever I believe 
 Wherever I've run 
 Longing for relief from the noonday sun 
 It is Your precipitation, Your vitalization that made me 
 It invited me home 
 That's where the promise is 
 Where the promise is 
 To abide in You 
 O my Lord 
 That's where the promise is 
 Where the promise is 
 To abide in You

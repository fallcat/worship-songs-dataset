I bring my heart to You 
 I bring my heart to You 
 I bring my heart to You 
 I bring my heart to You 
 All my worries and my doubts 
 I bring my heart to You 
 All my worries and my doubts 
 I bring my heart to You 
 You made a safe place 
 Knowing I would fall 
 And knowing I would break 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 You made a safe place 
 Knowing I would fall 
 And knowing I would break 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 I bring my heart to You 
 I bring my heart to You 
 (Verse 2 Modified) 
 All my worries and my doubts 
 I bring my heart to You 
 Only You can satisfy 
 So I bring my heart to You 
 Only You can satisfy 
 I bring my heart to You 
 You made a safe place 
 Knowing I would fall 
 And knowing I would break 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 You made a safe place 
 Knowing I would fall 
 And knowing I would break 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 You made a safe place 
 Knowing I would fall 
 And knowing I would break 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 You made a safe place 
 Knowing I would fall 
 And knowing I would break 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord 
 Take me to Your garden, Lord

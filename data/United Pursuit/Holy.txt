Through the wandering wilderness 
 In the shadows there could be found 
 Heaven touched by brokenness 
 And a cry rose up from the ground 
 Who can compare? 
 Who can compare? 
 Who can compare? 
 Who can compare? 
 Many have been here before 
 Singing holy, holy Lord 
 Every time You show me more 
 Singing holy, holy Lord 
 Who can compare? 
 Who can compare? 
 Who can compare? 
 Who can compare? 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy 
 Holy, holy

I want to give you all my love 
 And You say, "Child that will always be enough" 
 When I want to bury how I feel 
 You say, "Child let your heart begin to heal" 
 Wherever I go, You find me 
 You're already there 
 And I know darkness is nothing 
 My Lord, the safest I have ever been 
 Is trusting my heart to You 
 I will stay Lord, with Thee 
 Stay Lord, my heart will be 
 I will stay Lord, with Thee 
 Stay Lord, my heart will be here 
 I want to give you all my love 
 And You say, "Child that will always be enough" 
 When I want to bury how I feel 
 You say, "Child let your heart begin to heal" 
 Wherever I go, You find me 
 You're already there 
 And I know darkness is nothing 
 My Lord, the safest I have ever been 
 Is trusting my heart to You 
 I will stay Lord, with Thee 
 Stay Lord, my heart will be 
 I will stay Lord, with Thee 
 Stay Lord, my heart will be 
 I will stay Lord, with Thee 
 Stay Lord, my heart will be 
 I will stay Lord, with Thee 
 Stay Lord, my heart 
 I want to give you all my love 
 And You say, "Child that will always be enough" 
 I want to give you all my love 
 And You say, "Child that will always be enough"

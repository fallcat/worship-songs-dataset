I'm desperate and I'm weak 
 I long for the river that's rushing 
 I'm empty and in need 
 I long for the river that's rushing 
 Fill my empty space 
 Be my one and only 
 My innocence retrace 
 Be my one and only 
 I'm desperate for the fire 
 To burn away the hollow 
 The life within Your eyes 
 That cruelty couldn't swallow 
 Fill my empty space 
 Be my one and only 
 My innocence retrace 
 Be my one and only 
 Everything You do is redemption 
 Everything You are is perfect love 
 Everything You do is redemption 
 Everything You are 
 You are perfect love 
 You are redemption 
 You are perfect love 
 You are redemption 
 You are perfect love 
 You are redemption 
 You are perfect love 
 You are redemption 
 I'm desperate and I'm weak 
 I long for the river, it's rushing 
 I'm empty, I'm in need 
 I long for the river, it's rushing 
 I long for the river 
 I long for the river 
 I long for the river 
 I long for the river 
 I long for the river 
 I long for the river 
 I long for the river 
 I long for the river

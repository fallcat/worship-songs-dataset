Holy, Holy, You are God Almighty 
 And You reign victorious over all the earth 
 Holy, Holy, You are God Almighty 
 Yes, You reign victorious over all the earth 
 Let Your Kingdom come, and Your will be done 
 Here on earth as it is in heaven 
 And to Your renown hear our hearts cry out 
 Singing "Holy is the Lord" 
 God of Glory see Your victory story 
 In the lives of those who gather at the cross 
 Rock of ages be adorned with praises 
 As Your people raise their voice in thanks and love 
 All Glory, All honor, All wisdom strength and power 
 All Glory, All honor, are Yours alone forever

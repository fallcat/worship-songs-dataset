From the rising of the sun 
 To the ending of the day 
 One name alone be praised 
 Every nation, tribe and tongue 
 All creation lifting up 
 Your name alone we raise 
 Praise the Lord, all the earth, All the earth 
 Bless His name, only one name, now and always 
 Jesus, You have rescued us 
 You are good and You are just 
 One name alone be praised 
 From the heights and from the depths 
 In every heart with every breath 
 Your name alone we raise 
 Praise the Lord, all the earth, All the earth 
 Bless His name, only one name, now and always 
 Praise the Lord all the earth, All the earth 
 Bless His name, only one name, now and always 
 Every sky is filled with wonder 
 All creation lifting higher 
 The only King who reigns forever 
 Who is like our God, Who is like our God 
 Every sky is filled with wonder 
 All creation lifting higher 
 The only King who reigns forever 
 Who is like our God? Who is like our God? 
 Praise the Lord, all the earth, All the earth 
 Bless His name, only one name, now and always 
 Praise the Lord, all the earth, All the earth 
 Bless His name, only one name, now and always 
 Bless His name, only one name, now and always

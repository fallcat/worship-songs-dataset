This world is not my home 
 I'm here for a moment 
 It's all I've ever known 
 But this world is not my home 
 The fight is not my own 
 These burdens aren't my future 
 The empty tomb has shown 
 I am bound for glory 
 I am free because I'm bound 
 I am bound for heavens gate 
 Where my feet will stand on holy ground 
 I am bound for glory 
 The saving work is done 
 Death is not my ending 
 My God has overcome 
 I am bound for glory 
 All my pain, hurt and shame 
 Gone when Jesus calls my name 
 Endless joy endless praise 
 All when Jesus calls my name

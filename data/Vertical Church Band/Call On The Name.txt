Call On The Name 
 Worship Leader: Seth McConkey 
 (Jason Ingram, Andi Rozier, Reuben Morgan) 
 My light when I'm lost 
 My rest when I'm weary 
 My peace in the raging storm 
 You will never falter, You will never fail 
 My song in the night 
 My shield in the battle 
 My help when I need it most 
 You will never falter, You will never fail 
 I will call on the name 
 I will call on the name of the Lord 
 My God is greater 
 Find my strength in the name 
 Find my strength in the name of the Lord 
 Jesus, my Savior 
 My sin on the cross 
 My promise of Heaven 
 My hope is in You alone 
 You will never falter, You will never fail 
 You will not falter, You will not fail 
 For You are strong to save 
 You will deliver, You will prevail 
 Yes, You will make a way

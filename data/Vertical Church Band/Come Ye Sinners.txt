Come ye sinners poor and needy 
 Weak and wounded sick and sore 
 Jesus ready stands to save you 
 With compassion, love and power 
 Come ye thirsty to the fountain 
 Come and find his goodness here 
 True belief and true repentance 
 Every grace that brings you near 
 I will arise and go to Jesus 
 He will embrace me as His own 
 And in the arms of my Savior 
 There is life forevermore 
 Come ye weary heavy laden 
 Lost and ruined by the fall 
 And if you wait until you're better 
 You will never come at all 
 I will arise and go to Jesus 
 He will embrace me as His own 
 And in the arms of my Savior 
 There is life forevermore 
 You are life forevermore 
 There is no one else for me 
 No else for me 
 I won't look back 
 I won't look back 
 I will arise and go to Jesus 
 He will embrace me as His own 
 And in the arms of my Savior 
 There is life forevermore

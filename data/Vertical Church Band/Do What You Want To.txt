It's Your heart we're searching for 
 We want You and nothing more 
 Let Your glory fill this place 
 We're alive in Your presence 
 We surrender all to You 
 Do what You want to, 
 Do what You want to 
 God we long to see You move 
 Do what you want to, 
 Do what You want to 
 We are standing in Your light 
 And our hearts are open wide 
 Let us see more than before 
 Lord, come have your way here 
 All consuming fire fall, 
 Fall on us

With the rising of the sun 
 You are the Saviour 
 When this passing day is gone 
 You are the Saviour 
 In the battle for my soul 
 You are the Saviour 
 Though I'm broken I'm made whole 
 You are the Saviour 
 For all You've done and yet to do 
 I worship You 
 For every step You've brought me through 
 I worship You 
 On the cross You made a way 
 You are the Saviour 
 Death defeated through the grave 
 You are the Saviour 
 For all You've done and yet to do 
 I worship You 
 For every step You've brought me through 
 I worship you 
 For all You've done and yet to do 
 I worship You 
 My every breath returns to You 
 I worship You 
 I worship You 
 Your blood has covered me 
 No love is greater 
 You taught my heart to sing 
 Jesus my Saviour 
 Your blood has covered me 
 No love is greater 
 You taught my heart to sing 
 Jesus my Saviour 
 For all You've done and yet to do 
 I worship You 
 For every step You've brought me through 
 I worship You 
 For all You've done and yet to do 
 I worship You 
 My every breath returns to You 
 I worship You 
 I worship You 
 Your blood has covered me 
 No love is greater 
 You taught my heart to sing 
 Jesus my Saviour 
 Your blood has covered me 
 No love is greater 
 You taught my heart to sing 
 Jesus my Saviour

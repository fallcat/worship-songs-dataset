Worship Leader: Andi Rozier 
 (Jason Ingram, Andi Rozier, Paul Baloche) 
 We're reaching out to welcome You, God 
 Fill this place again with Your song 
 Flood our thoughts with wonder and awe 
 Give us a greater glimpse of a never-changing God 
 All we want and all we need 
 Is found in You, found in You 
 Jesus, every victory 
 Is found in You, found in You 
 Open wide, our hearts now to Yours 
 Every fear, bowed down to Your love 
 That we would see like never before 
 Give us a greater glimpse of a never-changing God 
 In Your presence there is freedom 
 In Your presence we are made whole 
 In Your presence there is freedom 
 In Your presence we are made whole

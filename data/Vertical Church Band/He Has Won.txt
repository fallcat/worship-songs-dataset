To all who are the tired and the heavy laden 
 Hope has come 
 To all who feel the weight of a broken spirit 
 Hope has come 
 Lift up your eyes, lift up your head 
 The power of our sin is dead 
 He has won 
 Death is swallowed up in victory 
 Through the Son 
 The grave has lost its sting and its grip over me 
 'Cause He has won, He has won 
 To those who seek the love of a perfect Father 
 Hope has come 
 To those who see the light of the risen Savior 
 Hope has come 
 Lift up your eyes, lift up your head 
 The power of our sin is dead 
 Jesus has come, Jesus has come 
 Sing it louder, sing it louder 
 Jesus has won, Jesus has won 
 Sing it louder, sing it louder 
 He has won 
 Death is swallowed up in victory 
 Through the Son 
 The grave has lost its sting and its grip over me 
 'Cause He has won, He has won

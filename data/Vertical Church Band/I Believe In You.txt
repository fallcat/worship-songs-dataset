Oh, oh, oh... 
 I believe in you, you are the one 
 You are the one I'll love for all time 
 Nothing else compares to you cause you are the one 
 You are the one I'll love for all time 
 My heart willnot be moved, my eyes are fixed on you 
 Jesus, the one, the one who saved me, 
 You are the king, forever reigning 
 Now I'm alive and free, found in you, found in you 
 Jesus, I will live for you, cause you are the one, 
 You are the one I'll love for all time 
 And I will put my faith in you cause you are the one, 
 You are the one I'll love for all time 
 You opened my eyes, by faith you gave me 
 Rescued my soul, my God remade me 
 Now I'm alive and live all for you

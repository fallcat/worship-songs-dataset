When the sea is calm and all is right 
 When I feel Your favor flood my life 
 Even in the good, I'll follow You 
 Even in the good, I'll follow You 
 When the boat is tossed upon the waves 
 When I wonder if You'll keep me safe 
 Even in the storms, I'll follow You 
 Even in the storms, I'll follow You 
 I believe everything that You say You are 
 I believe that I have seen Your unchanging heart 
 In the good things and in the hardest part 
 I believe and I will follow You 
 I believe and I will follow You 
 When I see the wicked prospering 
 When I feel I have no voice to sing 
 Even in the want, I'll follow You 
 Even in the want, I'll follow You 
 I believe everything that You say You are 
 I believe that I have seen Your unchanging heart 
 In the good things and in the hardest part 
 I believe and I will follow You 
 I believe and I will follow You 
 When I find myself so far from home 
 And You lead me somewhere I don't wanna go 
 Even in my death, I'll follow You 
 Even in my death, I'll follow You 
 When I come to end this race I've run 
 And I receive the prize that Christ has won 
 I will be with You in Paradise 
 I will be with You in Paradise

Go on and speak against my borrowed innocence 
 The judge is my defense, I'm going free 
 Right when the gavel fell, I heard the freedom bell 
 Ring through the heart of hell, I'm going free 
 I'm going free 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 You threw my shackles in the sea 
 Glory, glory, hallelujah 
 Jesus is my liberty 
 I'm going free 
 I won't go back again, that's just not who I am 
 Lord, I'm a brand new man, I'm going free 
 I'm on a narrow road, it's paved with grace and hope 
 It's gonna lead me home, I'm going free 
 I'm going free 
 I am free, I am free indeed 
 I am free, I am free indeed 
 We are free, free indeed 
 We are free, free indeed 
 Someday I'll fly away on Your amazing grace 
 Your love is my jailbreak, I'm going free

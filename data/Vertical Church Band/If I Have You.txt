I don't need the riches of this world 
 I can't even take them where I'm going 
 I don't need a thousand empty words 
 I just need the ones that You have spoken 
 If I have You and nothing else, I have everything 
 If I have You and nothing else 
 If I have You and nothing else, I have everything 
 If I have You and nothing else 
 I don't need to see tomorrow's plans 
 I just need to trust that You are working 
 I don't even need to understand 
 I just need to keep You as the first thing 
 If I have You and nothing else, I have everything 
 If I have You and nothing else 
 If I have You and nothing else, I have everything 
 If I have You and nothing else

Treasure of greatest price 
 Healer, giving me life 
 Faithful, again and again 
 Jesus Your love never ends 
 Sovereign in all that You do 
 Refuge my hope is in You 
 Mighty Your enemies fall 
 Jesus You reign over all 
 It's who You are 
 It's who You are 
 It's who You'll always be 
 Seeker finding the lost 
 Savior bearing my cross 
 Worthy You're the lamb that was slain 
 Jesus, great is Your name 
 Jesus, Jesus, 
 Yesterday, today, forever 
 You're the same 
 Everlasting, never failing 
 Yesterday, today, forever 
 You're the same

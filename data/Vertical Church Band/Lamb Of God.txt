You came from heaven's throne 
 Acquainted with our sorrow 
 To trade the debt we owed, 
 Your suffering for our freedom 
 The Lamb of God in my place, 
 Your blood poured out, my sin erased 
 It was my death You died 
 I am raised to life 
 Hallelujah, the Lamb of God 
 My name upon Your heart 
 My shame upon Your shoulders 
 The power of sin undone 
 The cross for my salvation 
 My God, there is no greater love 
 There is no greater love 
 The Saviour lifted up 
 There is no greater love 
 The Lamb of God in my place, 
 Your blood pour out, my sin erased 
 It was my death You died 
 I am raised to life 
 Hallelujah, the Lamb of God

Arise, for the Light has come 
 Darkness bows down 
 To the risen Son, the risen Son 
 Arise, raise your hands and sing 
 To the one God 
 To the one God 
 You are, You are 
 The matchless King 
 Who tore down the gates of the enemy 
 Make way, make way 
 For Christ and sing 
 Let your kingdom come 
 Let your kingdom come 
 Arise, for the battle's won 
 Our hearts bow down 
 To the risen Son, the risen Son 
 Arise, raise your hands and sing 
 To the one God 
 To the one God 
 You are, You are 
 The matchless King 
 Who tore down the gates of the enemy 
 Make way, make way 
 For Christ and sing 
 Let your Kingdom come 
 Come let the light shine in 
 Come let the light shine in 
 Come let the light shine in 
 Come let the light shine in 
 We'll let Your light shine in 
 We'll let Your light shine in 
 We'll let Your light shine in 
 We'll let Your light shine in 
 You are, You are 
 The matchless King 
 Who tore down the gates of the enemy 
 Make way, make way 
 For Christ and sing 
 Let your Kingdom come 
 You are, You are 
 The matchless King 
 Who tore down the gates of the enemy 
 Make way, make way 
 For Christ and sing 
 Let your Kingdom come 
 Oh, let your kingdom come 
 Oh, let your kingdom come 
 Let your Kingdom come

Who wore the heavens as royal robes 
 Fashioned the morning and the heavenly hosts 
 Who gave the word when all things were new 
 Oh God it's You, it's You 
 Who fixed His heart firm upon man 
 Knowing the cost before He began 
 Who gave himself when all Things were new 
 Oh God it's You, it's You You are Holy, Holy Lord Almighty 
 God of Glory there is none like You 
 Holy, Holy Lord Almighty 
 God of Glory there is none like You Who wore our sorrows as royal robes 
 And fashioned our victory by dying alone 
 Who gave himself to make all things new 
 Oh God it's You, it's You Jesus, crucified, raised to life 
 Jesus, lift Him high, lift Him high

You were reaching through the storm 
 Walking on the water 
 Even when I could not see 
 In the middle of it all 
 When I thought You were a thousand miles away 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 After all You are constant 
 After all You are only good 
 After all You are sovereign 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Thank you Lord 
 You were singing in the dark 
 Whispering Your promise 
 Even when I could not hear 
 I was held in Your arms 
 Carried for a thousand miles to show 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 After all You are constant 
 After all You are only good 
 After all You are sovereign 
 Not for a moment did You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 And every step every breath you are there 
 Every tear every cry every prayer 
 In my hurt at my worst 
 When my world falls down 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 After all You are constant 
 After all You are only good 
 After all You are sovereign 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 After all You are constant, yes you are 
 After all You are only good 
 After all You are sovereign 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Not for a moment will You forsake me 
 Thank you Lord 
 You are faithful, God 
 Yes you are 
 And You constant 
 You are good 
 You will never leave us Jesus 
 You will never forsake us O lord 
 For we are children 
 Your corresponding 
 We are yours O Lord 
 We belong to you faithful God 
 We belong to you 
 You will never leave us 
 You will never leave us 
 Yes Lord

Can He breathe in to the dust? 
 Can He make sons out of us? 
 Life is in His mighty hands 
 Life is in almighty hands 
 He can do it, yes, He can 
 He will prove it, our God can 
 No one else can save us, redeem us, create a new life in us 
 Only Jesus can 
 Can He love His enemies? 
 Can He make them family? 
 Life is in His mighty hands 
 Life is in almighty hands 
 Can He heal the leper's limb? 
 Can He cleanse us from within? 
 Can we drink from living streams? 
 Can we ever be redeemed? 
 He has healed the leper's limb 
 He has cleansed us from within 
 We have drunk from living streams 
 Surely, we have been redeemed

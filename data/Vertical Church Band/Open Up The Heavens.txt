We've waited for this day 
 We're gathered in your name 
 Calling out to you 
 Your glory like a fire 
 Awakening desire 
 Will burn our hearts with truth 
 You're the reason we're here 
 You're the reason we're singing 
 Open up the heavens 
 We want to see you 
 Open up the floodgates 
 A mighty river 
 Flowing from your heart 
 Filling every part of our praise 
 Your presence in this place 
 Your glory on our face 
 We're looking to the skies 
 Descending like a cloud 
 You're standing with us now 
 Lord, unveil our eyes 
 You're the reason we're here 
 You're the reason we're singing 
 Open up the heavens 
 We want to see you 
 Open up the floodgates 
 A mighty river 
 Flowing from your heart 
 Filling every part of our praise 
 Yes, open up the heavens 
 We want to see you 
 Open up the floodgates 
 A mighty river 
 Flowing from your heart 
 Filling every part of our praise 
 Show us, show us your glory 
 Show us, show us your power 
 Show us, show us your glory, Lord 
 We want to see you, Lord 
 Show us, show us your glory 
 Show us, show us your power 
 Show us, show us your glory, Lord 
 Yes, we want to see you 
 We want to see you 
 We want to see you 
 So open up the heavens 
 We want to see you 
 Open up the floodgates 
 A mighty river 
 Flowing from your heart 
 Filling every part of our praise 
 We sing, sing 
 Open up the heavens 
 We want to see you 
 Open up the floodgates 
 A mighty river 
 Flowing from your heart 
 Filling every part of our praise

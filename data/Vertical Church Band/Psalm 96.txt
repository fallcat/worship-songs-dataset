Sing to the Lord a new song 
 Sing to the Lord all the earth 
 Sing to the Lord and bless His Name 
 Tell of His salvation from day to day 
 Declare His glory among the nations 
 His marvelous works among all the peoples 
 For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised 
 He is to be feared above all gods 
 For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols 
 But the Lord made the heavens 
 Splendor, majesty before Him 
 Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary 
 So ascribe to the Lord O families of the peoples 
 Ascribe to the Lord 
 Glory and strength 
 Ascribe to the Lord 
 Glory to His Name 
 Bring an offering and come into His courts 
 Worship the Lord in the splendor of His holiness 
 Tremble before Him all the earth 
 Say among the nations, "The Lord reigns!" Yes! 
 His Word is established and will not be moved 
 And He will judge the peoples with equity 
 So let the heavens be glad 
 And let the earth rejoice 
 Let the sea roar and all that fills it 
 And the field exalt and everything in it 
 Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy before the Lord 
 For He comes 
 And He comes 
 For He comes to judge the world with righteousness 
 And all the peoples with His faithfulness 
 Yes Lord, Your faithfulness 
 Jesus, Jesus, yes today today forever, you're the same 
 Everlasting, never failing, Yes today, today, forever, you're the same 
 Jesus, Jesus, yes today today forever, you're the same 
 Everlasting, never failing, Yes today, today, forever, you're the same 
 Yes today, today, forever, You're the same 
 Yes You are Lord 
 Jesus, Jesus

Restore my soul, revive my heart 
 Renew my life in every part 
 Reveal to me what sin remains 
 Then lead me to the cross again 
 Restore my soul, revive my heart 
 Renew my life in every part 
 Reveal to me what sins remains 
 Then me to the cross again 
 At at the cross I'll find the way 
 To live the life Your hand has made 
 So find me there, Lord, and help me stay 
 In true surrender with You, my Savior 
 Relight the fire that burned so strong 
 Reminding me what You have done 
 My one request is to be changed 
 Restore my soul, revive my heart 
 Renew my life in every part 
 Reveal to me what sin remains 
 Then lead me to the cross again 
 Restore my soul, revive my heart 
 Renew my life in every part 
 Reveal to me what sins remains 
 Then me to the cross again 
 At at the cross I'll find the way 
 To live the life Your hand has made 
 So find me there, Lord, and help me stay 
 In true surrender with You, my Savior 
 Relight the fire that burned so strong 
 Reminding me what You have done 
 My one request is to be changed

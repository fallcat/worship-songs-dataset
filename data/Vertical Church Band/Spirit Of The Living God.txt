 Spirit of the living god 
 We only want to hear your voice 
 We're hanging on every word 2x 
 Because when you speak, when you move. 
 When you do what only you can do 
 It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek 
 When you come in the room 
 When you do what only you can do 
 It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek 
 You're changing everything 
 Spirit of the living god

 We're leaning into all you are everything else can wait

 Come down and breath upon our hearts 
 Come down and have your way 
 Because when you speak, when you move. 
 When you do what only you can do 
 It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek 
 When you come in the room 
 When you do what only you can do 
 It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek 
 When you move, you move all our fears 
 When you move, you move us to tears 2x 
 When you fall, we fall on our knees 
 When you fall, we fall at your feet 2x 
 Because when you speak, when you move. 
 When you do what only you can do 
 It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek 
 When you come in the room 
 When you do what only you can do 
 It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek 
 Spirit of the living god

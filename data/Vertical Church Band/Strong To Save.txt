Oh God who set us free 
 From our captivity 
 Your hand is strong to save 
 You split the raging sea 
 You crush our enemies 
 Your hand is strong to save 
 Here we go! 
 The Lord our God is mighty in battle 
 We are not afraid 
 His hand upholds us through our trials 
 Our God is strong to save 
 Our God is strong to save 
 Here in this desert place 
 We're carried by your grace 
 Your hand is strong to save 
 When in the promised land 
 We'll see your perfect plan 
 Because your hand is strong to save 
 The Lord our God is mighty in battle 
 We are not afraid 
 His hand upholds us through our trials 
 Our God is strong to save 
 Above all death, above all life 
 Above the battles that we fight 
 Above any other name 
 Our God is strong to save 
 Above the heavens and the earth 
 Above the rulers of this world 
 Above any other name 
 Our God is strong to save 
 The Lord our God is mighty in battle 
 We are not afraid 
 His hand upholds us through our trials 
 Our God is strong to save 
 The Lord our God is mighty in battle 
 We are not afraid 
 His hand upholds us through our trials 
 Our God is strong to save 
 Above all death, above all life 
 Above the battles that we fight 
 Above any other name 
 Our God is strong to save 
 Above the heavens and the earth 
 Above the rulers of this world 
 Above any other name 
 Our God is strong to save 
 Our God is strong to save

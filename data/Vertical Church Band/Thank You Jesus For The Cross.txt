My life lived for only me 
 My days spent so sinfully 
 My heart was dark, my eyes too blind to see My pride destroying me 
 But Your life, sent for sin to die 
 And Your blood, shed to justify Upon the cross, my ransom to afford This sinner's great reward 
 Thank You, Jesus, for the cross 
 Thank You for the price You paid for us Giving up Your life to save the lost Thank You, Jesus, for the cross 
 The crown placed upon Your head The nails meant for me instead 
 Your death became the only way to life For me to live is Christ 
 Thank You, Jesus, for the cross 
 Thank You for the price You paid for us Giving up Your life to save the lost Thank You, Jesus, for the cross

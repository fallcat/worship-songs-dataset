When the ground beneath my feet gives way 
 And I hear the sound of crashing waves 
 All my world is washing out to sea 
 I'm hidden safe in the God who never moves 
 Holding fast to the promise of the truth 
 That You are holding tighter still to me 
 The Rock won't move and His word is strong 
 The Rock won't move and His love can't be undone 
 The Rock won't move and His word is strong 
 The Rock won't move and His love can't be undone 
 The Rock of our Salvation 
 My hope is in the promise of Your blood 
 My support within the raging flood 
 Even in the tempest, I can sing 
 I'm hidden safe in the God who never moves 
 Holding fast to the promise of Your truth 
 That You are holding tighter still to me 
 The Rock won't move and His word is strong 
 The Rock won't move and His love can't be undone 
 The Rock won't move and His word is strong 
 The Rock won't move and His love can't be undone 
 The Rock of our Salvation 
 Woah, woah 
 Woah, the Rock of our salvation 
 On Christ the Solid Rock I stand 
 All other ground is sinking sand 
 The Rock won't move, the Rock won't move 
 When darkness seems to hide His face 
 I rest on His unchanging grace 
 The Rock won't move, the Rock won't move 
 The Rock won't move and His word is strong 
 The Rock won't move and His love can't be undone 
 The Rock won't move and His word is strong 
 The Rock won't move and His love can't be undone 
 The Rock of our Salvation 
 Lead me to the Rock 
 The Rock that is higher 
 That is greater 
 The Rock of our Salvation 
 Lead me to the Rock 
 The Rock that is Stronger 
 That is Stronger 
 The Rock that is Jesus 
 The Rock that is Jesus 
 He will never move 
 He is faithful

Though my sins be red as scarlet, Though my guilt is plain, You retrieved me from the darkness, I have been reclaimed. 
 It's Your blood, It's Your blood that makes me whole; It's Your blood, It's the only fountain, oh; It's Your blood, I am covered in the flow, And made white, whiter than snow. 
 Though I wander still You offered righteousness for shame; You pursued me to the Cross; And took the sinners' place; How Glorious Your Grace. 
 It's Your blood, It's Your blood that makes me whole; It's Your blood, It's the only fountain, oh; It's Your blood, I'm covered in the flow, And made white, whiter than snow, And made white, whiter than snow. 
 Jesus, now be glorified! 
 Christ our Saviour lifted high! 
 Praise the One who justifies! 
 Hallelujah! 
 Hallelujah! 
 Jesus, now be glorified! 
 Christ our Saviour lifted high! 
 Praise the One who justifies! 
 Hallelujah! 
 Hallelujah! 
 It's Your blood, It's Your blood that makes me whole; It's Your blood, It's the only fountain, oh; It's Your blood, I'm covered in the flow, And made white, whiter than snow.

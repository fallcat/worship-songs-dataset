When she crying, when she's hurting, 
 When she's fallen and can't go on 
 When she broken into pieces, 
 In her mourning has lost her song 
 Who will help the church? 
 Who will rise up? 
 Who will rise up? 
 How long will we wait? 
 How much will it take? 
 Who will help the church? 
 Who will rise up? 
 Who will rise up? 
 When she's crawling through the ashes, 
 And she's calling out for help 
 And when she reaching from her kneeling, 
 She needs strength now, beyond herself 
 Who will help the church? 
 Who will rise up? 
 Who will rise up? 
 For every brother who has need 
 And every sister on her knees 
 We'll show the mercy we've received in our lives 
 And all the world will finally see 
 The love that makes a family 
 And He's alive in you and me. 
 We will rise! 
 Who will help the church? 
 Who will rise up? 
 Who will rise up? 
 How long will we wait? 
 How much will it take? 
 Who will rise up? 
 Who will rise up? 
 We will rise up. 
 We will rise up. 
 We will respond.

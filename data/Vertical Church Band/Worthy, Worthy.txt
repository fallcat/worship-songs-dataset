Worthy, Worthy 
 Worship Leader: Meredith Andrews 
 (Jacob Sooter, Mia Fieldes) 
 No pen or quill, no scribe in perfect skill 
 With flawless words could capture all You are 
 No lofty thought, no scholar of this world 
 Could grasp an inch of such infinity 
 Though we cannot comprehend such a mystery 
 Just a glimpse of You revealed is compelling us to sing 
 Holy, holy is the Lord God almighty 
 Worthy, worthy is Your Name 
 All of Heaven joins the universe ever crying 
 Worthy, worthy is Your name 
 With hearts amazed and songs that never frame 
 The fullness of your worth and majesty 
 We come again and fall on bended knee 
 And here adore the God that we don't see 
 When You return, we'll hear the trumpet sound 
 You'll lead us home riding on the clouds 
 Where we will stand and sing forevermore 
 The honor and the praise, the glory is the Lord's

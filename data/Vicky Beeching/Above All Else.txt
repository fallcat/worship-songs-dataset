Jesus, my passion in life is to know You 
 May all other goals bow down to 
 This journey of loving You more 
 Jesus, You've showered Your goodness on me 
 Given Your gifts so freely 
 But there's one thing I'm longing for 
 Hear my heart's cry 
 And my prayer for this life 
 Above all else 
 Above all else 
 Above all else 
 Give me Yourself 
 Savior, the more that I see Your beauty 
 The more that I glimpse Your glory 
 My heart is captured by You 
 Jesus, You are my greatest treasure 
 Nothing this world can offer 
 Could ever compare to You 
 So, hear my heart's cry 
 And my prayer for this life

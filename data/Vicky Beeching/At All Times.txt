In the mountains of joy, in the valley of tears 
 I will love you, I will trust you 
 When the flame's burning bright, when I'm weary and dry 
 I will love you, I will trust you 
 You are my strength and you are my song giving me hope and guiding me on 
 At all times I will sing of your greatness 
 At all times I will sing of your love 
 At all times I will sing of your faithfulness 
 For your goodness remains and your love is the same at all times 
 When your guidance is clear, when I can't see ahead 
 I will love you, I will trust you 
 In the summer of life, in the soul's darkest night 
 I will love you, I will trust you

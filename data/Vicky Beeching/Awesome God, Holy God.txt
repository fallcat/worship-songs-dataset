Everlasting God 
 The years go by but You're unchanging 
 In this fragile world 
 You are the only firm foundation 
 Always loving always true 
 Always merciful and good 
 So good 
 Yesterday today and forever 
 You are the same You never change 
 Yesterday today and forever 
 You are faithful and we will trust in You 
 We will trust in You 
 Uncreated One 
 You have no end and no beginning 
 Earthly powers fade 
 But there is no end to Your kingdom 
 Always loving always true 
 Always merciful and good 
 So good 
 Yesterday today and forever 
 You are the same You never change 
 Yesterday today and forever 
 You are faithful and we will trust in You 
 We will trust in You 
 We will trust in You 
 In You 
 Yahweh God unchanging 
 Yahweh firm foundation 
 Yahweh God unchanging 
 Yahweh firm foundation 
 Yesterday today and forever 
 You are the same You never change 
 Yesterday today and forever 
 You are faithful and we will trust in You 
 We will trust in You 
 We will trust in You 
 Faithful God 
 We will trust in You 
 We will trust in You 
 Faithful God

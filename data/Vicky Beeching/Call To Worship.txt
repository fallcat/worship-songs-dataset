The blazing sunrise, the endless oceans 
 The spinning planets all reveal their Maker's power 
 They shout His glory, they shine His beauty 
 Their voices cry an invitation to us all 
 They are summoning every soul, 
 Summoning every soul... 
 This is a call to worship 
 Let it echo all around the earth 
 This is a call to bow down 
 And give God the glory He deserves 
 We have gathered, to praise our Maker 
 We've come to worship him for we have heard the call 
 Let every nation and all creation 
 Join us worshipping the holy God of all 
 As we cry out to all of this world 
 Cry out to all of this world... 
 To the north and the south 
 Let this invitation resonate 
 To the east and the west 
 Let this invitation resonate 
 Till the north and the south 
 Till the east and the west 
 Overflow with praise

Your laughter it echoes like a joyous thunder 
 Your whisper it warms me like a summer breeze 
 Your anger is fiercer than the sun in its splendour 
 You're close and yet full of mystery 
 Ever since the day that I saw Your face 
 Try as I may, I cannot look away, I cannot look away... 
 Captivated by You 
 I am captivated by You 
 May my life be one unbroken gaze 
 Fixed upon the beauty of Your face 
 Beholding is becoming, so as You fill my gaze 
 I become more like You and my heart is changed 
 Beholding is becoming, so as You fill my view 
 Transform me into the likeness of You 
 This is what I ask, for all my days 
 That I may, never look away, never look away... 
 No other could ever be as beautiful 
 No other could ever steal my heart away 
 I just can't look away...

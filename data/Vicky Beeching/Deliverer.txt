Deliverer, come set me free 
 Break every chain holding me 
 Deliverer, come have Your way 
 I surrender to Your rule and reign 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is healing 
 You say the word and mountains are moved 
 Oceans and stars stand in awe of You 
 Just say the word and I will be changed 
 We'll see Your face and we will not be the same 
 'Cause where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is healing 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is hope 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is healing 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 And Your blood is enough to break every chain 
 Every chain 
 Every chain 
 And where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is freedom 
 Where the Spirit of the Lord is 
 There is healing

Come all who are weary, battleworn and weak 
 Come all of us broken, tired and in need 
 I for one am weary, lonely and afraid 
 So let us run for shelter 
 In the Savior's strong embrace 
 Come one and all, let us fall... 
 Into the everlasting arms 
 I'm running into the everlasting arms 
 I'm falling into eternity's embrace 
 Where I'm safe 
 Here my heart has found its resting place 
 Here we find our healing 
 Here we find our peace 
 Wrapped in Your unfailing love 
 Surrounded by Your peace 
 So I for one am letting 
 All my walls fall down 
 In this place of safety 
 This child has finally found 
 So come one and all, let us fall... 
 I'm finally home, I'm no longer alone 
 You surround me, all around me with Your love 
 And I'm finally home, no longer alone 
 You surround me, all around me with Your love

Come if you're joyful, happy, laughing 
 With a song spilling out of your soul 
 Come if you're broken and all that you know is 
 Your life is spinning out of control 
 Come if you've never had a father and 
 You're looking for a Father who will hold you in His arms 
 Wherever you've been, just come on in 
 No distance is too far 
 Come everyone under the sun 
 Lift up your heart to the Savior 
 Come everyone under the sun 
 And feel how it fells to be loved 
 Everyone, everyone under the sun 
 Come if you're addicted, in chains and afflicted 
 Welcome to feedom's embrace 
 Come if you're hiding your struggles inside 
 To the One who loves you anyway 
 Come and find the meaning of life is 
 To worship the God who can heal every heart 
 Wherever you've been just come on in 
 No distance is too far 
 Millions of voices, just one song 
 Come to the place where we belong 
 Come everyone under the sun 
 Lift up your heart to the Savior 
 Come everyone under the sun 
 And feel how it feels to be loved 
 Come everyone who walks this earth 
 Lift up your song to the heavens 
 Everyone, everyone under the sun

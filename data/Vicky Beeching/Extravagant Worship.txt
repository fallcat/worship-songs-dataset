Doesn't matter what people say 
 I forget their watching eyes 
 I just want to bring to You 
 My most costly, my most priceless, my most precious Sacrifice 
 Extravagant worship 
 Total surrender 
 Reckless abandon 
 I pour out my love, pour out myself 
 Saviour 
 Breaking open my thankful heart I release its praise perfume 
 Here I'll linger lifting to You 
 Songs of wonder, songs of worship Songs of deepest gratitude

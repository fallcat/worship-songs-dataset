You know me completely, like no other could 
 You love me so freely, when no other would 
 Your love's a mystery 
 For all eternity I'll be with You 
 You have won my heart forver more 
 You are mine and I'm forever Yours 
 You are my desire, my treasure in this life 
 And You have won my heart forever more 
 One day I will see You, standing face to face 
 One day I'll run into my Savior's strong embrace 
 It's such a mystery 
 For all eternity, I'll be with You 
 Jesus, how I love You 
 Jesus, how I love You 
 My heart is Yours, forever more

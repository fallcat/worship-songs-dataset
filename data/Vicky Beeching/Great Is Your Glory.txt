God came down and gave his life for me 
 Amen, Amen 
 Through flesh and blood he fought for victory 
 Amen, Amen 
 Crucified brought back to life 
 Amen, Amen 
 Seated at the Father's hand again 
 Amen, Amen 
 Great is the glory of the Lord Almighty 
 Great is the glory of the Lord 
 I will sing with all my heart unto the Lord Almighty 
 Great is your glory Lord 
 Crimson covered over sinless hands 
 Amen, Amen 
 But nails could never hold the son of man 
 Amen, Amen 
 Now the Father's love flows down on us 
 Amen, Amen 
 Hallelujah He will come again 
 Amen, Amen 
 You are the one who was 
 You are the one who is 
 You are the one who is to come

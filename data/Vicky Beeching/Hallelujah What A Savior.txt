God of heaven, You descended 
 For all of our sin and shame 
 Hands so holy offer healing 
 For every scar and stain 
 And we bow down, we bow down 
 Hallelujah what a Savior 
 We worship and adore 
 Hallelujah what a Savior 
 We glorify the Giver of Life 
 The Light of the World 
 Holy King of angel armies 
 Hanging between two thieves 
 Holy feet that walk the heavens 
 Nailed upon a tree 
 And we bow down, we bow down

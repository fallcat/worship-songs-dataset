One day every voice will sing 
 Every beggar, prince and king 
 Every nation, tongue and tribe 
 Every ocean in between will cry, will cry 
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow 
 Praise Him all creatures here below 
 To Him all the glory belongs 
 Praise Him above you heavenly hosts 
 Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost 
 Let all the earth sing along 
 Come join the song 
 Gathered round the throne above 
 We'll be swept up in the melody 
 Hearts will overflow with love 
 We'll be singing out a symphony, we'll sing 
 The song that fills eternity 
 Sung throughout all history 
 As angels shout and kings lay down their crowns 
 We bow down 
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow 
 Praise Him all creatures here below 
 Praise Him above you heavenly hosts 
 Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost

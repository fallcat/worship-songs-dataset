Your voice is the voice that 
 Commanded the universe to be 
 Your voice is the voice that 
 Is speaking words of love to me 
 How can it be? 
 Awesome God, Holy God 
 I worship You with wonder 
 Awesome God, Holy God 
 As You draw near √çm humbled 
 By Your majesty and the mystery 
 Of Your great love for me 
 Your arms are, the arms that 
 Hung shining stars in deepest space 
 Your arms are, the arms that 
 Surround me in a warm embrace 
 Amazing grace

Father, You are my shelter 
 You are my place to rest and hide 
 Father, You're my creator 
 You are the one who gives me life 
 I can't live without You, not even for a day 
 Laying down my pride I simply say 
 I am needing You and I'll be needing You a lifetime long 
 I am needing You as I offer up this fragile song 
 In my weakness You are strong

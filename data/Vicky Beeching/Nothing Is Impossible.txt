You can shine light into the darkness 
 You can set every prisoner free 
 You can make streams flow in the desert 
 This is what we are longing to see 
 Because we know and we believe... 
 Nothing, nothing is impossible for You 
 Anything, anything can happen when Your power breaks through 
 Hear our cry for Your supernatural touch 
 God of miracles come and visit us 
 Come Lord, shine light into the darkness 
 Come Lord, set every prisoner free 
 Come Lord, make streams flow in the desert 
 This is what we are longing to see 
 Because we know and we believe...

I've been hiding, I've been running away 
 But I am so tired of staying the same 
 Grace is calling, grace is drawing me back home 
 To You alone 
 Only Your love changes me 
 Only Your love sets me free 
 Only Your love can take my fear and doubt 
 And change me from the inside out 
 Only Your love 
 In this moment, with a heart wide open 
 I cry, "come and heal my life" 
 Mercy meets me, I'm completely amazed 
 I'll never be the same 
 I am reaching out, so in need of You 
 Come and heal my life 
 Come and make me new 
 I am reaching out, so in need of You 
 Come and heal my life 
 Come and make me new 
 How I love You 
 How I love You 
 How I love You 
 How I love You 
 Amazing love 
 Amazing love 
 Amazing love

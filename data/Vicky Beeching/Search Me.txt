Search me O God 
 Search me and find 
 Any way in me that does not reflect Your purity 
 Refine me O God 
 In the fire of Your gaze 
 That I might be holy in all of my ways 
 Take me deeper Lord 
 Draw me closer Lord... 
 Give me a heart after Your own heart 
 Give me a mind that is pure and pleasing to You 
 Fill me with love 
 With Your power and Your joy 
 That this world might see You in me

You formed us from the dust 
 You breathed Your breath in us 
 We are the work of Your hands 
 Now we breathe back to You 
 Love songs of gratitude 
 Adoring You with all we have 
 'Cause we were created 
 To worship Your name 
 We were created 
 To bring You our praise 
 If we don't worship You 
 We'll search for substitutes 
 To fill the void in our souls 
 Worshiping other things 
 Destroys our liberty 
 But as we praise You, we are free 
 'Cause we were created 
 To worship Your name 
 We were created 
 To bring You our praise 
 So we will worship 
 So we will praise 
 You our Creator 
 For all our days 
 This is what we were made to do 
 (We were created for) 
 This is what we were made to do 
 (We were created for) 
 So we lift up our praise to You 
 We were created 
 We were created 
 We were created 
 To worship Your name 
 We were created 
 To bring You our praise 
 So we will worship 
 So we will praise 
 You our Creator 
 For all our days 
 You our Creator 
 For all our days

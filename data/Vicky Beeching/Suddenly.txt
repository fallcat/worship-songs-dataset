Awaken us to see 
 The reality of eternity and feel it near 
 Awaken us to pray 
 As we watch and wait and anticipate with Holy fear 
 For the day You'll return again 
 Is closer now than it's ever been... 
 Suddenly, every eye will see 
 As You return in glory 
 Suddenly, every knee will fall 
 Before heaven's coming King 
 Jesus, here we stand, lifting up our hands 
 Asking You to purify our lives 
 So on that glorious day 
 When we stand face to face 
 Unashamed, we'll dance in heaven's light 
 For the moment is drawing near 
 When our radiant King will appear... 
 The Spirit and the Bride say, "come soon, Lord" 
 The Spirit and the Bride say, "come soon" 
 The Spirit and the Bride say, "come soon, Lord" 
 Suddenly

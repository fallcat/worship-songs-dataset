Son of God, You Reign in heaven's glory 
 Yet You chose to come to earth and save me 
 Humbled Yourself to die the cruelest death 
 No other act of love compares to this 
 The greatest gift I've ever received 
 Is the cross, the cross 
 For there You gave Yourself up for me 
 On the cross, the cross 
 And with the blood You poured out for me 
 You have saved my soul You have given me 
 The greatest gift of all 
 Your heart aches for all the lost and hurting 
 At the cross You wait to take our burdens 
 Longing to heal our wounds and make us whole 
 Longing to hear us sing with thankful souls

O precious sight, my Savior stands 
 Dying for me with outstretched hands 
 O precious sight, I love to gaze 
 Remembering salvation's day 
 Remembering salvation's day 
 Though my eyes linger on this scene 
 May passing time and years not steal 
 The power with which it impacts me 
 The freshness of it's mystery 
 The freshness of it's mystery 
 May I never lose the wonder 
 The wonder of the cross 
 May I see it like the first time 
 Standing as a sinner lost 
 Undone my mercy and left speechless 
 Watching wide eyed at the cost 
 May I never lose the wonder 
 The wonder of the cross 
 Behold the God - Man crucified 
 The perfect sinless sacrifice 
 As blood ran down those nails and wood 
 History was split in two 
 Yes, History was split in two 
 Behold the empty wooden tree 
 His body gone, alive and free 
 We sing with everlasting joy 
 For sin and death have been destroyed 
 Sin and death have been destroyed

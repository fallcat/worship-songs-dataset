You are high over all nations 
 Your glory shines above the heavens 
 Humbled Yourself to love and save us 
 Be praised through endless generations 
 There's no one like our God, no one at all 
 Gave His Son for us, Jesus the Lord 
 Who can love us like He does, no one at all 
 O how we love You Lord 
 You lift the needy from the ashes 
 And seat them high up with the princes 
 You give the broken hearted healing 
 Trading our scars for Your beauty and freedom

Turn your eyes upon Jesus 
 Look full in His wonderful face 
 And the things of earth 
 Will grow strangely dim 
 In the light of His glory and grace 
 In the light of His glory and grace 
 Isn't He beautiful? 
 Isn't He beautiful? 
 Outshining sun and stars 
 It's indescribable 
 How breathtaking You are 
 So I turn my eyes upon You now 
 Look full in Your wonderful face 
 And the things of earth 
 They grow strangely dim 
 In the light of Your glory and grace 
 In the light of Your glory and grace 
 You are so beautiful 
 You are so beautiful 
 Outshining sun and stars 
 It's indescribable 
 How breathtaking You are

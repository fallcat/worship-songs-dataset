I don't know what the future holds 
 Or what lies beyond my horizon 
 The years ahead are just out of sight 
 Well, I think sometimes that You hide them 
 So that I'll walk by faith not sight 
 So I'll take Your hand, holding tight 
 Through twenty-six summers 
 And twenty-six winters 
 I've laughed in the springtime 
 I've cried in the rain 
 Though I've questioned the meaning 
 Of some of life's seasons 
 It's true that they've left me holding on 
 Tighter to You 
 My one desire for the road ahead 
 Is that we would walk it together 
 Friend and King, You're my everything 
 May I stay by Your side forever 
 For when my heart's afraid, You're near 
 Whispering to my soul, 'don't fear' 
 And I will trust in You alone 
 For You're the hand leading me home 
 Leading me home... 
 I've spent twenty-six summers 
 And twenty-six winters with You 
 Through all of the seasons 
 And my search for reasons 
 You've carried me through 
 I will keep holding on to You...

You formed us from the dust 
 You breathed Your breath in us 
 We are the work of Your hands 
 Now we breathe back to You 
 Love songs of gratitude 
 Adoring You with all we have 
 We were created 
 To worship Your name 
 We were created to bring You our praise 
 If we don't worship You 
 We'll search for substitutes 
 To fill the void in our souls 
 Worshipping other things 
 Destroys our liberty 
 But as we praise You we are free 
 We were created 
 To worship Your name 
 We were created to bring You our praise 
 So we will worship, so we will praise 
 You our Creator, for all our days 
 This is what we were made to do 
 This is what we were made to do 
 So we lift up our praise to You

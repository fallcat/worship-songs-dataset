It's one o clock and I can't sleep 
 Or at least I haven't tried 
 Something there is inside a man 
 Which cannot be denied 
 It's two o'clock and I can't sleep 
 Or at least I'm still awake 
 Something there is in consciousness 
 That slumber cannot break 
 There's a drunk on stage who believes in God 
 There's a girl with a tutu on 
 And a ten-year-old with hazel eyes 
 And a wino who you conned 
 It's three o'clock and I can't sleep 
 But I'm starting to look weak 
 Something there is in humankind 
 That fights when odds are bleak 
 It's four o'clock and I can't sleep 
 Or at least that's what I'll say 
 When my wife comes to wake me 
 I'll have lost another day 
 There's a best friend who has disappeared 
 And a car with a dented hood 
 Everybody said I follow you 
 But nobody understood 
 It's five o'clock and I'm asleep 
 But I think I'm still awake 
 Something there is in consciousness 
 That slumber cannot break 
 It's six o'clock and I'm not here 
 I'm fighting in some war 
 That nobody inside my head 
 Remembers anymore

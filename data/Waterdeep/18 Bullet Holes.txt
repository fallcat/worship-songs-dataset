18 bullet holes in the body of a priest 
 They say he was eating a hot dog when the ammunition was released. 
 They say he was always fat and lazy but he was an awfully nice guy. 
 That's just one more death to show you you never know when you're gonna die. 
 You might be facing the beast 
 Sometimes, God, I feel like I'm living in a bone grinding mill 
 And every time I hear the sound I can barely stand still 
 It's a thing I can't quite make out sometimes but it seems to keep getting louder- 
 One more body from the valley of the dry bones getting ground up into powder 
 Against Your holy will 
 Oh, God, it hurts so bad to love anybody down here 
 Why don't You come and help me out? 
 'Cause I can't even see clear 
 The funny thing about the way a girl gets destroyed 
 About the way that deal goes down 
 Is that everybody pretty much sees it coming at the sister 
 From all the way across town 
 And she isn't always blinded, she isn't always far astray 
 She just might not be thinking, she might be having a bad day 
 But when you choose, you choose, and when you drown, you drown 
 Last night I dreamed that You swallowed me into Yourself 
 And I was floating on the sea inside 
 When I landed on the shore, I saw all these people that I thought had died 
 I hadn't seen some of them for ages 
 They had left without a single word 
 And when I said something to them, not a single one of them had heard 
 They were all looking right through everything like it wasn't even there 
 Some were full of anger, some full of fear 
 And then I recognized that something very sad 
 But very beautiful was happening right here 
 They were all caught outside standing alone in a very heavy rain 
 And when a raindrop landed on my tongue 
 I didn't need You to explain 
 That these were Your tears 
 Oh, God, it hurts so bad to love anybody down here 
 Oh, that's right, You know so well

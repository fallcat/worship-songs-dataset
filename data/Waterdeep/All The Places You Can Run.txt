Out behind the shed 
 In the valley of the dead 
 All in one accord 
 Underneath the hood of a '65 Ford 
 In grocery store 
 Crying out for more 
 Getting stoned or bored 
 Even on a pew in the house of the Lord 
 All the places you can run 
 All the ways you set to flight 
 In the middle of the broad daylight 
 Under cover of the secret night 
 You can run 
 Behind your smiling eyes 
 Your face looked so surprised 
 Sure, I'm doing fine 
 Down at the bottom of a bottle of wine 
 In a suit and tie 
 Seeing someone on the sly 
 Without nothing on 
 Pushing your lawnmower regularly 'cross your lawn

I am haunted by my love for comparison 
 My fascination with a single common theme 
 And I am hounded by the fear that I might be losing it 
 Slipping from reality into dream 
 When my mind is muddled by the way it seems to work 
 I start looking for just one connecting Force 
 Someone to assure me we that didn't lose the war today 
 That the battle's General's still riding on his horse 
 In the mornings when I pray, I've often come to You with dreams 
 Little bits of power that I can't comprehend 
 And sometimes I can keep my eyes unclosed for long enough 
 To see the blowing of a distant steady Wind 
 The distance doesn't take too long for You to cover it 
 And when You reach me, You just blow these things apart 
 You clear the crowd that's gathered 'round the crisis of my soul 
 And whisper to my suffocating heart 
 And is the juice of the joints of the motion of life 
 And is the love that is between God and his beautiful wife 
 And has two hands and two feet and a long, lovely side 
 And rose three days after he was crucified 
 So You're the Force of gravity that I feel pulling at my feet 
 You're the Fuel at the center of the sun 
 And, it's your Ghost that fills the atmosphere with what we need to breathe 
 And, everything I've ever wondered, You're the one 
 Both my hands are stained with blood 
 And both my lips are stained with tears 
 From when I kissed the widow of the man I killed 
 And, yet You're asking me to swallow Your forgivness here today 
 You say the bond required for my pardon's been fulfilled

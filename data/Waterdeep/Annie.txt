Annie 
 Oh, Annie 
 Who raised you up? 
 Who raised you up so well? 
 Coming 'round the block 
 Key will turn the lock 
 The door will swing 
 Hum a little tune 
 Making up for nothing 
 Summer setting in 
 Hit the pool with friends 
 And this time try to dive 
 Lying down at noon 
 Waking up for nothing

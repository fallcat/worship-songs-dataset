A friend of mine dropped out of school 
 He didn't tell no one. He just left one day 
 Folks said he was actin' like a fool 
 But he said, "I was about to go crazy and I was already foolish anyway 
 And what did I have to lose? What did I have to lose?" 
 He took off to Wisconsin late that night 
 Wisconsin, where he figured he could blend in 
 He said nothing felt good under him- not the road, 
 Not the tuition money in his pocket, 
 Not really even the car he was driving in 
 And what did he have to lose? What did he have to lose? 
 He said 
 At least I got a car I can drive tonight 
 I know it ain't much but it makes me feel all right 
 And all right ain't good, but all right's all right 
 At least I got a car I can drive tonight 
 Oh, college was hard for me and my friends 
 We all felt like little kids but they said we couldn't act that way 
 I knew I was supposed to change 
 But changing's hard and it was easier just to play video games 
 What did we have to lose? What did we have to lose? 
 We said 
 Man, sometimes don't you want to just sit still? 
 OCause you can only run so fast or drive so far 
 And home might feel like a funny idea that you never understood 
 But you want it more than you want the car 
 'Cause you're tired of how the seats feel 
 And you're tired of the steering wheel 
 And you'd buy a new car but 
 The last thing you want is something new 
 Last thing you want is something new 
 Going home feels like the thing you ought to do 
 Cause You can only drive so far 
 Man I wish I had a home tonight 
 Somewhere I could feel more than all right 
 And all right ain't bad, but all right's just all right 
 And, man, I wish I had a home tonight 
 (Man, I wish I had a home)

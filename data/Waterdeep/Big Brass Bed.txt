If I could lie in a bed of moss 
 And sleep and dream the nights away 
 I'd make the world count its cost 
 For a big brass bed 
 And rivers would lullaby me to sleep 
 As I'd curl up in a blanket of leaves 
 While you'd doze off to the drone of police 
 And the firing of lead 
 All the children are nestled snug in their beds 
 All the tvs blare curses and laugh at the dead 
 And the vagabond runs from this Vagabond Age 
 For the castles down the block have electric private eyes 
 And the neighbor gives you looks that say you're somewhat despised 
 And your car that's been stolen makes you almost want to cry out for 
 The firing of lead. 
 You shuffle your papers you'll take to the zoo 
 You frown on the way and then smile upon cue 
 And everyone know just what they're supposed to do 
 For their big brass bed 
 If I could lie in green pastures and rest 
 Far from alarms and the cold hard cement 
 I'd send all the world my bill for its rent 
 And its big brass bed

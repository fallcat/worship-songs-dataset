The space in my mind is too small for You 
 The space in my heart is too small for You too 
 And all of things of the earth that I know 
 Are too small for all of the greatness You've shown 
 But in all of this I'm still facing my needs 
 And I'm scared of how big they feel to me 
 I know You, You, You are big enough to hold me 
 I know You, You, You are big enough to hold me 
 I know You Lord, yeah You 
 Will carry me through 
 The space between stars is billions of miles 
 The space for the famous and millions of eyes 
 But not all of the stars in the heavens and earth 
 None can compare to Your infinite worth 
 And I still get lonely and wonder outloud 
 If anyone notices me in a crowd 
 I know You, You, You are big enough to hold me 
 I know You, You, You are big enough to hold me 
 I know You Lord, yeah You 
 Will carry me through 
 I know You, You, You are big enough to hold me 
 I know You, You, You are big enough to hold me 
 I know You Lord, yeah You 
 Will carry me through 
 How great, how high 
 How deep, how wide 
 Is Your love 
 The space in my mind is too small for You 
 The space in my heart is too small for You too 
 And all of things of the earth that I know 
 Are too small for all of the greatness You've shown 
 But in all of this I'm still facing my needs 
 And I'm scared of how big they feel to me 
 Nothing can separate from the love of Christ 
 All my doubts, He sees past and things to come

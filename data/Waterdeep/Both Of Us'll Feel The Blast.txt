We're both dirty, baby- that's just the way it goes 
 We'll try to cut the fuses off before everything blows 
 And if it blows and both of us are standing real close by 
 Then both of us'll feel the blast and both of us'll die 
 But dying's overrated, it's a ticket on a train 
 And as long as I can hold your hand, I'll know that I'm still sane 
 Maybe I'm an idiot for thinking that that's true 
 But I believe that Jesus knew what He was doing when He gave me you 
 Lately I've been wondering- what are we gonna do 
 When we wake up in the morning and its just me and you? 
 'Cause we ain't never done this thing but I guess that's how it goes 
 You breathe deep as it comes to you and hold tight when it blows 
 And if it blows and both of us are standing real close by 
 Then both of us'll feel the blast and both of us'll die 
 And dying's underrated, it's a ticket to the feast- 
 The one we're all invited to, from the greatest to the least 
 I hope we sit together when Jesus serves the wine 
 So I can look into your eyes when I taste it the first time 
 And I know there's no secrets when you're sitting at that table 
 But I believe we'll smile real knowingly when we read the label 
 And it says "passion sacrificed to keep from going crazy." 
 We'll tip our glasses to the Host who used to look so hazy 
 And drink it down all sweet and slow and slip inside His mind 
 And realize as it goes down- this is communion wine 
 This is communion wine 
 This is communion wine 
 This is communion wine

The revolution came and the revolution died 
 We believed all of the leaders but the leaders just lied 
 Sitting in a jail with a bitter grudge to bear 
 Released as a loner with nothing left to share 
 Make a tower tall. Make a tower high 
 Build it so big that it just rips through the sky 
 Scramble up the language; try to communicate 
 We make our plans in vain; we cannot elevate 
 We all just grit our teeth while we watch the nightly news 
 Another year another hundred thousand lives to lose 
 All this talk of peace and the great new consciousness 
 But the weight of expectation left our living rooms a mess 
 When I was in the cell, nobody came by 
 No one would have known if I'd have died 
 And all I want to know is- would someone shoot me straight- 
 Was there ever a chance, or were we meant to wait? 
 To see the tower fall, to see the crooked straight 
 To see the huddled masses pass through the gate 
 Speaking all in common 
 The promises of peace 
 The sound of weeping mothers 
 Everywhere has ceased 
 We'll do what we can 
 We'll do what we can 
 For now

It's been like a circus in her head 
 And she sighs when she hears the lions roar 
 She can stare through the cages till the colors turn red 
 But she just wishes it would all go away 
 Of all the things she thought she'd be 
 It wasn't a falling-tear factory 
 The days she has dreamed of are trickling by 
 She tries to find definition in the sky 
 And she'd walk so far to see 
 A swinging lady on a tall trapeze 
 And she'd smile at all the movements and colors 
 Turn and slowly leave the place behind 
 She wonders where her feet are now 
 She wonders who'd stand with her now 
 The beauty of this sad story 
 Is that this girl is really me 
 And I remembered all the things He said 
 How He wiped away the circus in my head 
 And I walked so far to see 
 A swinging lady on a tall trapeze 
 And I smiled at all the movements and colors 
 Turned and slowly left that place behind 
 The peace my feet rest now 
 It's Your hand that pulls me through somehow (2x) 
 Hey. 
 Oh the blood of Jesus (repeat 3x) 
 It washes white as snow 
 White as snow. 
 Oh come let us adore Him (3x) 
 For He alone is worthy (3x) 
 Christ... Christ the Lord.

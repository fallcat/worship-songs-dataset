The city of Atlantis is wide and real 
 The streetlights still work, and the bells still peal 
 Homes under domes of high-pressure glass 
 Seated on lawns of green water grass 
 You try to make out the sounds with no luck 
 So you turn the radio dial in your truck 
 The town hall meetings are opened with song 
 The citizens all willingly sing along 
 Drowned in the sound of the saddest refrains 
 The mayor conveys her most intimate pain 
 You see her lips move, but you can't hear her speak 
 So your mind wanders back to the slow oil leak 
 Ophelia with seaweed in her tangled hair 
 Travel or unravel- she will follow you there 
 Open your gates, O, dear hidden Atlantis 
 I can't smell the rose, but I know where the plant is

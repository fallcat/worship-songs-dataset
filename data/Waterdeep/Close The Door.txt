Every time that I get down 
 I am like a salmon on 
 An upstream journey, then 
 Death to follow once I spawn 
 I have seen the big fish climb 
 The ladder at the reservoir 
 Watch 'em work like devils 
 Half delirious do they even know where they are? 
 Jesus I'm a sucker; I 
 Wish I believed less of the lies 
 Did anything I thought I knew 
 Turn out to be true? 
 Baby boys and little toys are all that I see anymore 
 Will somebody close the door? 
 It's cold outside 
 Every single time I thought that 
 I had figured it all out 
 I was run aground again and 
 Floundering with crazy doubt 
 Maybe every way I'd learned 
 To deal with the tragedy 
 Was just another junkyard find 
 Rust-eaten and raggedy 
 I have paced the floor at night 
 Staring in his tiny face 
 Swearing that I'll do my best 
 To make for him a solid place 
 Barring acts of God or even 
 Acts of other men, I'll be 
 The father that I always wished 
 I had been allowed to see

Cold is your heart in the winter 
 Sweet is a song 
 Strange are the sounds that they made for you 
 Empty and gone 
 Long is my heart when I hear you tell 
 Of all that's been locked up and broken into 
 Lost is the sweetness of the mornings 
 Where all your secrets are held 
 Cold are the images of love and steel 
 Warm is your hand 
 Hard is the heart that won't let you feel 
 Soft is the iron in your land 
 Lost are the ships that are set to sea 
 Sinking them is sometimes in the plan 
 But you and I we have another way 
 We will sleep and dream of sand 
 Large is the swelling of the ocean's rage 
 So strong are its tides 
 It will pull you though you have a place 
 To anchor inside 
 Dark are the eyes that will never see 
 The kingdom of The Great Light 
 And my Lord, He smiles on everything 
 And to the meek, He gives delight

These are the confessions of a broken down man 
 She said she needed a father 
 So I faked fatherhood and drew her in 
 I don't know if it was intended 
 Maybe something broke inside of me 
 A long long time ago 
 And it never has been mended 
 But one night on my bed 
 She told me something that she never told nobody 
 And I just laid there cold as a stone and stared 
 These are the confessions of a broken down man 
 I had a baby by my first wife 
 She was wanting one and I gave in 
 I swear I loved her and our home 
 But a man has got to work to live 
 And sometimes he can find himself out on the road alone 
 And when I came back home 
 She's holding baby 
 But I can't remember for the life of me 
 What is his name? 
 These are the confessions of a broken down man 
 I give up. I give in. I can't do this anymore 
 I've been turned out by my family 
 I have heard them slam the door 
 I'm like a wounded man out on a hill in the wind 
 Saying Father, forgive me 
 Father, forgive me 
 Father, forgive me 
 For I have sinned

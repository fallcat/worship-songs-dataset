 The first day of class, they 
 Call out your name 
 And you have to reply 
 Even if you're shy. 
 And if you choose to 
 Pretend you didn't hear 
 They'd think that you weren't there 
 And they'd keep on breathing air 
 Without you. 
 Cowards never win 
 They're torn up in the wind 
 And everyone forgets to ask their name 
 If you wonder why 
 People don't want to die 
 It's 'cause they're too scared to deal with their blame 
 If you sit through 
 A wedding now and then 
 You'll feel the heaviness in the room 
 Rest on the bride and groom 
 And when they say they 
 Understand the vows 
 Each one gives a life 
 To become man and wife 
 Every naive dream we have 
 Doesn't always please us 
 But up on every cross you bear 
 Is the long awaited Jesus 
 The last day of class they 
 Call out your name 
 And if you don't reply 
 They'll all just wonder why 
 Cowards never win 
 But when they feel the wind 
 They get the chance to take a brand new name 
 So don't believe the lie 
 That there's no reason you should try 
 Because there's a way to deal with your blame

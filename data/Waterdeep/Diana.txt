Diana stays with me tonight 
 Then tomorrow 
 Then tomorrow 
 Who will tell you if I cry 
 O, my sorrow 
 O, my sorrow 
 I hardly ever knew her face 
 And here she is, taking your place 
 You have gone so far away 
 For all I know it's outer space 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 Pining for yesterday 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 Feeling like an empty plate 
 He went away today 
 And I don't know when he'll be back 
 Before he left he held my face 
 And told me he was gonna crack 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 Kick your legs and bend your knees 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 Stare up at the apple trees

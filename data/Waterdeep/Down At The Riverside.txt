They sat near one another at the water's edge 
 I'll say "they" because "we" is too hard to say 
 And he told her what he'd come so far to tell her 
 With tears in her eves she said it can't be that way 
 I left the ring down at the riverside 
 He stared at the water for a long time, leaning on his hand 
 He was going through the things that he was wondering 
 The air was fairly still, like the calm before the storm 
 No one would have guessed the rain. there was not distant thundering 
 He still felt a long ways away inside 
 I left the ring down at the riverside 
 Should I tell them how he cried? 
 Should I tell them how you held me, my never-bride? 
 And how I left the ring down at the riverside 
 The riverside- 
 One like where believers stood for John to baptize them 
 I'm going down to die, but I'll be coming up alive then 
 I'm going down to die, but He'll bring me up alive then

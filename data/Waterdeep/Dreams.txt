 He was holding her hand 
 For the very first time 
 He was telling her things that she just did not understand 
 Between her hand and his 
 She felt every touch 
 She would laugh and cry and laugh and cry inside because for her it was a little much 
 Dreams come true 
 Now that I'm with you 
 God is good even if sometimes you don't wait around in his neighborhood 
 She woke up from a bad dream/nightmare 
 And can't get back to sleep 
 He just holds her all night in his arms waiting patiently 
 He can summon her smile 
 From the ends of the earth 
 He has given his heart though he doesn't know quite what it's worth 
 He is loved and beloved 
 He is one of a kind 
 He is nothing he's made himself 
 He has all God's grace on his side 
 And a little bit of grace 
 Goes a very long way 
 It makes straight and flat all the 12 step plans you've made to walk straight 
 Some songs are prayers, some are just commentaries, 
 Some make you smile, some make you cry 
 Some help you focus while you're waiting (on his tributaries) 
 Seems like He's always moving his neighborhood next to mine

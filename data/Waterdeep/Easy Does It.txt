Don't waste your breath 
 Don't waste my time 
 Can't you see 
 I'm sick of trying 
 No more cheap veneer 
 No more Paul Revere 
 Running every day 
 I float around 
 Try not to hit the ground 
 And break a limb 
 'Cause my bones became thin 
 When I was in a play 
 Showing off Broadway 
 Reciting all my lines 
 Easy does it 
 Easy does it 
 Don't waste your breath 
 Don't waste my time 
 The fire is hot 
 The walls are limestone 
 Living in a cave 
 It's easy to behave 
 To think we call this saved 
 Don't you miss the sky? 
 Easy does it 
 Easy does it

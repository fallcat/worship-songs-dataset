She's got her eye on the wind 
 She resents her own skin 
 She wants to fly 
 She's got a bend in her mind 
 She treats herself so unkind 
 She don't know why 
 Innocent Jane 
 She's got an innocent name 
 But in the still of the night 
 Or in the heat of the light 
 She'll confess to you 
 That everybody's guilty 
 She'll confess to you 
 That everybody's guilty 
 Well, everybody can stare 
 They won't find nothing there incriminating 
 It's all buried inside 
 Where it can stay safe and hide 
 Latent destruction, lying in waiting 
 Come on, Jane, throw that stuff away 
 You got to let yourself die every day 
 Because the thief breaks in to kill and steal 
 He don't make no friends and his words ain't real 
 He will take you out and beat on you 
 And after all of this is through 
 He'll make you promise that you'll never tell 
 He wants your loyalty in the fires of hell 
 You got to run into the arms of someone kinder 
 Someone who doesn't care what a woman's put behind her 
 Just say, "Forgiver of sins, 
 Won't you come right on in 
 And in the still of the night 
 By a sweet candlelight 
 Tell me how You came to be the Savior of the guilty 
 How You came to be the Savior of the guilty."

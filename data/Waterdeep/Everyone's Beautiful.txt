I used to draw all the time back when I was in high school 
 Thick yellow pencils with soft lead that smeared real easy 
 Page after page. I was lonely. But senior year I met a girl and she made me feel better here 
 But a girl was a girl was a girl 
 And she was beautiful 
 Everyone's beautiful 
 I smeared the picture and left it with her to appraise 
 I remember in junior high, half sick from fear on the hillside 
 Eddie wore braces and talked like he couldn't be beaten 
 Shawn had said Friday out back after school and Eddie was stumbling, blood mixed with drool 
 But a fight is a fight is a fight 
 Still they were beautiful 
 Everyone's beautiful 
 All of us crawling on hands and knees in need of you 
 I want to lift 
 My memory 
 Of them in the desert and set it on fire 
 And watch it burn 
 Watch it burn 
 Oh, how it changes 
 And hope that the smoke of the sins of my youth 
 Will sail to the base of the throne of a King 
 Cause a prayer is a prayer is a prayer 
 And they were beautiful 
 Everyone's beautiful 
 Let them all find their redemption down deep in Your eyes

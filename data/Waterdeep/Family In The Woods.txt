The stepson of the engineer 
 That drove the train you rode 
 Sold the railroad company 
 And the debt that you owed 
 And so now the new management 
 Comes a-knockin' at your door 
 It's pay up or eviction 
 There's no mercy anymore 
 Hey, hey 
 Who will remember me when I'm gone? 
 It ain't about how much you know 
 Or how long you been known 
 It's do you know the folks in charge 
 And how much do you own 
 It's bucks and bloody knuckles 
 It's contracts cut in steel 
 It's clauses sharp and pointed 
 And who's behind the wheel 
 So tell me that old story 
 Of the family in the woods 
 Momma cooked the crawdad 
 And Daddy traded goods 
 Tell me how when their boy died 
 They yelled and cried and prayed 
 Tell me how this very day 
 There's flowers on his grave

 Will You find me in the valley 
 I'm afraid I've lost my way 
 I was up there on the mountain 
 But I'm not up there today 
 There were thousands at our wedding 
 There were thousands when she died 
 So will you find me in the valley 
 And collect the tears I've cried 
 I can hardly see her face now 
 Warm but flickering like a flame 
 Will you find me in the valley 
 And remind me of my name 
 All the people gather round me 
 Try to comfort me from pain 
 But I can hardly hear their words now 
 I'm by the river in the rain 
 Come remind me of my name

I told a lie 
 Could you tell me why? 
 Heavy sigh 
 You gotta help me die 
 Cord of sin 
 You said you'd cut it. Can you tell me when? 
 Jesus, kiss 
 Come and collect me for eternal bliss 
 Though it's against your nature to be impolite 
 Would You please break into my heart tonight 
 And steal away my fear? 
 'Cause it's my nature to just sit and guard it 
 Though the prison doors open, I'm afraid to depart it 
 I'm stuck right here 
 You gotta get me clear 
 I hear a word 
 Somebody says something that I know is absurd 
 But I give it room 
 Now, inside the greenhouse of my heart I got a deady bloom 
 My fist 'round a rose 
 My hands all bloody from the thorns there, I suppose 
 But I don't let go 
 Sometimes I'm a coward. I try not to let it show 
 Though it's against your nature to be impolite 
 Would You please break into my heart tonight 
 And steal away my fear? 
 'Cause it's my nature to just sit and guard it 
 Though the prison doors open, I'm afraid to depart it 
 I'm stuck right here 
 You gotta get me clear

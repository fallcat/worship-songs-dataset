Go find John 
 Hiding in the backyard 
 Crying 'cause his hands hurt 
 All the thorns 
 Crying for you to 
 Go find John 
 Scattered and bewildered 
 Swallowed by the dirt there 
 All alone 
 Go tell him 
 I told him 
 Go tell him 
 He's welcome to come home 
 Go tell him 
 I know him 
 He's tried and tried and nothing works at all 
 Go find John 
 Drunk to kill the pain there 
 Lying on a strange bed 
 All the seed 
 On the ground 
 Go find John 
 Floating in the ocean 
 In her dark apartment 
 All alone 
 Go tell him 
 I told him 
 Go tell him 
 He's welcome to come home 
 Go tell him 
 I know him 
 He's tried and tried and nothing works at all 
 Go find John

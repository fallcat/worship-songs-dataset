Go tell it on the mountaintops 
 That I'm alive 
 Go listen to the children cry 
 And let them know 
 That dark and night are not their masters 
 Between you you'll know all the things 
 That I never said out loud 
 Don't walk away from the crowd 
 Go tell them that it's cold outside 
 And I won't thrive there 
 And I'm getting tired of hiding My face 
 From your disgrace 
 Although you think that you've disguised it 
 And when you get too tired of waiting 
 To picture My face in the clouds 
 Look around 
 I know it won't be sown the way 
 You want it to be 
 I will make it grow with or without you 
 You'll pray, I'll wait 
 You may fall down a time or two 
 Go tell it in the valleys low 
 That I'm alive 
 Go listen to the men that sigh 
 And let them know that dark and night 
 Are not their masters 
 And when you get too tired of waiting 
 To picture My face in the clouds 
 Look around

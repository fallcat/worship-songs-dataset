You can leave right now 
 You can ring a bell 
 You can tell 'em you think I ain't doin' too well 
 But when I stood like you 
 I eventually fell 
 Go on and leave right now 
 Go on and ring your bell 
 I'm amazed by life 
 And it's amazed by me 
 We're a strange old pair- me and eternity 
 It don't make good sense 
 It ain't easy to see 
 But I'm amazed by life 
 And it's amazed by me 
 It's a long hard road 
 With a good, good end 
 And if I keep on walking on past the crooked bend 
 I will meet my Maker 
 I will meet my Friend 
 It's a long hard road 
 With a good, good end 
 You can leave right now 
 You can ring a bell 
 You can tell 'em you think I ain't doin' too well 
 But when I stood like you 
 I eventually fell 
 So you can leave right now 
 Go on and ring your bell 
 'Cause I'm amazed by life 
 And it's amazed by me 
 'Cause it's a long hard road 
 With a good, good end 
 It's a long hard road 
 With a good, good end

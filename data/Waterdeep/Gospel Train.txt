Well that gospel train is a' comin' 
 Comin' right down the track 
 That gospel train is a' comin' 
 Comin' right down the track 
 And when that train leaves the station 
 I can tell you right now it's never comin' back 
 You may think your train ain't a' comin' 
 Till at least a quarter past nine, 
 You may think your train ain't a' comin' 
 Till at least a quarter past nine, 
 But by the time you reach the platform 
 You'll find out you've been left behind 
 Well the train used to rule this country 
 It used to be the only way to go 
 But we've left the engineer behind these days 
 We think we've found a better way to go 
 But on that day whether the track's laid 
 He'll be comin' over ice and snow 
 Well that gospel train is a' comin' 
 Comin' right down the track 
 That gospel train is a' comin' 
 Comin' right down the track 
 And when that train leaves the station 
 I can tell you right now it's never comin' back 
 They said it moves too slow, it moves too slow 
 They said it moves too slow, it moves too slow 
 Oh... what do they know?

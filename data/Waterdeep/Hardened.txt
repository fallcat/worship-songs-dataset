There's a little child drowning in a pond 
 And you would have me throw a blanket on 
 The surface of the water 
 Even though she was your daughter 
 And watch just how helplessly she dies 
 For the sake of how it looks 
 'Cause it's like you've read in books 
 It's a symbol of the way you see this life 
 And if a savior came upon a tray of gold 
 You'd insist that he had already been sold 
 Even though you kew he hadn't 
 You're afraid to trade the bad in 
 For a good you don't know 
 Like a certain generation 
 In a proud and headstrong nation 
 Who expects God to dance whenever she plays the fife 
 And if you want to talk in terms of the survival of the fittest 
 Then take a look at the soul's auction house and whose the highest bid is 
 You understand the fear of man 
 But you forgot about the fear of God 
 And to the bloody ransom 
 That makes an ugly soul turn handsome 
 You give a condescending nod 
 There's a sense of desparation in your touch 
 And you say out loud you hate it very much 
 But you're addicted to your sadness 
 Cause it creates the touch of madness 
 The kind you like inside your veins 
 Oh, why are you so hardened? 
 You know you could be pardoned 
 I guess you just will not let go of the reins 
 The lexicon of death is all you know 
 You feel suffocated by the falling snow 
 Cause you miss the beauty there 
 In the quiet holy air 
 And start looking for a desert you can roam 
 Your eyes too closed to see 
 The secret ministry 
 Of the frost upon the window of your home 
 Oh, why are you so hardened? 
 You know you could be pardoned 
 And then you would not feel so alone 
 You're not alone. 
 You're not alone. 
 You're not alone.

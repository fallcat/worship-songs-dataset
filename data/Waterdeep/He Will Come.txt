Soon it will be hammered into what she calls her silly head 
 That she really isn't silly but she's beautiful instead 
 But every time she gets a hold of something pretty, it slips away 
 So she keeps hoping that someday soon 
 He will come. He will come 
 He will comfort all that's hardened 
 Change the deserts into gardens 
 And we all will see His face. 
 He will come. He will come. 
 He will soften all the starkness 
 Break the chambers of our darkness 
 And we'll all be overwhelmed 
 She spilled her coffee in her Chevy on the way to work at 8:05 
 She always thought that she was clumsy and she hated it and wondered why 
 She can handle any tragedy that happens but not little things like this 
 So she keeps hoping that someday soon 
 Within the world of a girl, the words she hears they mean an awful lot 
 And the music in her mind when she gets older has the lyrics she was taught 
 And when she gets to heaven all the right things will be said 
 And He will look on her with favor 
 All my scars will turn to fountains 
 All my valleys into mountains 
 And we all will see His face 
 All you watchmen lift your voices 
 Then every boy and girl rejoices 
 When we'll all be overwhelmed

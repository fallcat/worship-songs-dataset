I was young and I was dumb 
 And my left arm was going numb 
 Dare to think, while I'm on the brink 
 That a simple word of comfort just might come 
 Brace yourselves. We're headin' back 
 In a time machine to a heart attack 
 Where the flow of blood into the brain 
 Is down to a trickle, almost insane 
 They were telling me I was really free 
 They could see it by the way I used my words 
 But in the dark of night I could see that they weren't right 
 Because speeches are to free as cages are to birds 
 Peel off each old sticker 
 With a slow and steady hand 
 Strip off all the high gloss sheen 
 And maybe go sell the van 
 It's time to let the people know 
 That you're sorry that you made 'em go 
 And that life must be a more sacred thing 
 Than a couple cheap words 
 And a promise ring 
 So kick me down, and tear my gown 
 'Cause I've been prancing 'round the stage in my underwear 
 But I just went along I even lead them all in song 
 We had special words that we always used down there 
 It's a deep dark mine and I gave in 
 To the fact that we're up against a cave-in 
 I'm pretty happy that I lost control 
 'Cause I never really had it. I was just on a roll

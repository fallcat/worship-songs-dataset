When you feel like the days just drone on and on and on 
 And you feel like the nights are quickly gone 
 And on the inside your heart is gaping wide 
 And on the inside you feel like no one's on your side 
 Well, I am 
 When you thought you could rest, but you found out you were wrong 
 And there's another need another battle 
 Another one more thing that comes along 
 And on the inside 
 You hear the fall but you hate the falling sound 
 And on the inside 
 You can't pick another broken piece up off the ground 
 Well I know 
 Hush little baby don't say a word 
 Daddy's gone and bought you a great big heaven to rest in 
 He's bought it with blood and put the seal in your heart 
 It'll give you the hope you need to get up and start again 
 When all the things you thought you left behind are still hanging on 
 And everything you try to do right ends up all wrong 
 And on the inside everyone else seems basically fine 
 But on the inside even they won't let go of the dead and cling to what's alive 
 Well I AM

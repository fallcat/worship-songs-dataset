I am more than you think 
 I am more than you know 
 I'm as black as the darkest night 
 And whiter than snow 
 You're tipping through wires and words 
 And spires and tombstones 
 I have burned with desire 
 Felt the air become fire 
 Buried Myself with stones 
 Given lions my bones 
 And I love you whether or not you believe Me 
 I'm as swift as an arrow 
 But I'm slow when you stray 
 I'm as calm as the waters 
 That we walked on that day 
 And I love whether or not you believe Me 
 If you ask Me again My reply still will stand 
 I am who I am 
 And I love whether or not you believe Me

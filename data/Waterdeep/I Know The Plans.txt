You talk of Hating war 
 But where's your own peace time 
 You don't love any more 
 Oh my children 
 You linger in your mind 
 "Everyone's so unkind" 
 You forgot about the mines you laid on your land 
 I know the plans I have for you 
 I know the things I want for you to do 
 I know the plans I have for you 
 And it hurts sometimes, to see you cry 
 You read up on the lies 
 And keep them in motion 
 So clever the disguise of devotioin 
 You say that there's no time 
 But there you stand joking 
 You forgot that I'm the one 
 Who weighs the words you've spoken 
 I know the plans I have for you 
 I know the things that I want for you to do 
 I know the plans I have for you 
 And it hurts sometimes to see you cry

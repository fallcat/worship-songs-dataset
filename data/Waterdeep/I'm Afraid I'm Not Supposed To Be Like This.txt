Well I'm afraid I'm not supposed to be like this 
 Like I was born in a land where no serpent hissed 
 And I have waited a long time for Your kiss 
 Well I have felt that they'd all take offense at me 
 And so a fence I have built to protect the seed 
 But all the bricks will secure its mortality 
 I have been seated in circles and stood in disgrace 
 At the noted intention to be in place 
 And I have seen that one man saved the human race 
 But it took His life and it took His faith 
 I have risen from ashes and fed on flames 
 But even so I still fear I have played a game 
 And it seems no one else is as sick and depraved 
 I have heard that I'm not supposed to be this way 
 And still the stones that are lifted fall down to stay 
 But I keep doubting and think one will strike my face 
 He's been promising me something more than pain 
 Where the cost is grace and my loss is gain 
 And I have chosen because there is no other way 
 I either wallow in shame 
 Or humble myself and be saved 
 And be saved

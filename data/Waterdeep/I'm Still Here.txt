I went flying in a dream last night 
 Whenever I was scared, I took flight 
 It didn't seem brave and it didn't seem right 
 But it always seemed easier than puttin' up a fight 
 And I'm almost gone 
 But I'm still here 
 Tell me a story that'll make me feel 
 Something far flung but something real 
 Something that's human but not depraved 
 Somebody endangered, but somebody still saved 
 When Joshua sat them children down 
 He said I ain't no Moses but I ain't no clown 
 And I know how that river's wide 
 But if you follow me we'll make it to the other side 
 And I'm almost there 
 But I'm still

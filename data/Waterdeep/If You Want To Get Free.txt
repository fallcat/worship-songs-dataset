In the gas station bathroom by the condom machine 
 I heard the word of the Lord 
 He said "Take off your shoes, 
 This is holy ground too 
 You know I came for the sick and the bored." 
 Beneath the selling of beers 
 And the welling up of tears 
 Out beyond the beam of the remote control 
 There's a whispering voice 
 That the humble ear ears 
 That says "I am still waiting 
 For you to ask just to be made whole." 
 And the bush it was burning on the mountain top 
 And though the leaves never blackened, the fire didn't stop 
 That's the way that it works in this old life of sin 
 You gotta let the fire burn you just to get clean within 
 I am so often deterred from my actual intent 
 By distractions in a cellophane wrap 
 And the cruel voice that taunts me when I open them up 
 To find just one more box full of crap 
 It's where you're mocked while you abstain 
 And then cursed when you give in 
 It's all a game that's impossible to beat 
 But there's a peaceful refrain God'll sing in your brain 
 When you put the nails to your hands and your feet 
 And the smell of our sacrifices 
 Still fills up my head 
 There's just a few left at the altar, Lord 
 All the rest of them fled 
 And we've cried and we've tried 
 We've sweat and we've bled 
 But we don't just need atonement 
 We need to be raised from the dead 
 When they took down the cross from that dark hillside 
 The blood on their hands was the blood from his side 
 That's the way that it works, That's the way it must be. 
 You gotta let His blood stain you of you want to get free 
 If you want to get free 
 Don't you want to get free? 
 I think you want to be free.

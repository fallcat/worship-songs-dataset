Find my heart at the bottom of the well I'm in 
 Find my heart 
 Lower your strong hand down and rescue me 
 Rescue me 
 Its just like you to bring light into darkness 
 Its just like you, Lord its just like you 
 Its just like you to bring light into darkness 
 Its just like you, Lord its just like you 
 See my soul in the place I fell into 
 See my soul 
 Lift my head from the shame I've bowed down to 
 Lift my head 
 Its just like you to bring beauty to ashes 
 Its just like you, Lord its just like you 
 Its just like you to bring beauty to ashes 
 Its just like you, Lord its just like you 
 And I've been trying my whole life to be good without the cross 
 But all that I have gained is this emptiness and loss 
 So speak to me in my hopeless lonely place 
 Speak to me 
 Raise me up when no hope seems to remain 
 Raise me up 
 Its just like to bring life to these dry bones 
 Its just like you Lord its just like you 
 Its just like you to bring life to these dry bones 
 Its just like you Lord its just like you 
 Its just like you to bring beauty to ashes 
 Its just like you Lord its just like you 
 Its just like you to bring beauty to ashes 
 Its just like you Lord its just like you 
 Its just like you to bring light into darkness 
 Its just like you Lord its just like you 
 Its just like you to bring light into darkness 
 Its just like you Lord its just like you

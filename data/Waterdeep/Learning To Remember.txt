 I'm starting to see 
 Just how I get so lost while I'm looking at the book 
 Inside the Counselor's door 
 And starting to read 
 I lose track of the time and I forget just what it was 
 That I had come here for 
 But I'm learning to remember 
 Oh I'm learning to remember 
 A walk in the rain 
 Can be so painful if you've been so dry that now you've cracked 
 And now you're open and sore 
 Ignoring the pain 
 Seems so perfect as an option till you're lying 
 Nearly dead on the floor 
 I find that I forget 
 The blood and how it mixed with sweat 
 The saving of the lost 
 The breathing of Your last upon a cross

Let's get into a fight 
 Come on, little baby, let's argue 
 Then we'll be sure that everything's all right 
 Even if we get mad like dogs 
 Dogs out in the junkyard 
 Crazy from the neighborhood kids' talk 
 Come one little baby, let's cast aside 
 All this crap and take a ride 
 To the California ocean side 
 Eat some oysters, let 'em slide 
 Even if they taste bad 
 We'll head to the dock where the waves get wide 
 And hide ourselves away 
 I just wanna be a little crazy 
 Baby, I just wanna live 
 Oh, I wanna patch the holes and stop the drain 
 And stop this leaking, stop this leaking like a sieve 
 Let's get into a fight 
 Come on, little baby, let's argue 
 Then we'll be sure that everything's all right 
 Even if we get small dark holes 
 Holes in our famous egos 
 Where a little light can reach our poor souls 
 Come on baby, let's hoist the sail 
 Out on the sea where the wind won't fail 
 A thousand miles from the nearest jail 
 Pour some wine and eat some cheese 
 Take deep breaths and slack our knees 
 And sail away

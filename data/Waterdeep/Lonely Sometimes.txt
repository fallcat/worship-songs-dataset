I woke up from a strange rain 
 And it was dreaming outside 
 I rolled over for the telephone 
 I thought I'd call someone 
 Tell them I dreamed I had died 
 But I know that I was all alone 
 I just get lonely sometimes 
 I want someone to take away my grief 
 I just get lonely sometimes 
 I want to wake up in the morning with someone 
 Lying next to me who I can turn to for relief 
 I just get lonely sometimes 
 But I know I just need You 
 I probably slept in a bed of bitterness 
 That's why I woke up this way 
 That's probably why I'm in this lonesome hole 
 I probably got to needing everything 
 And needing it today 
 That's probably why I play this lonely role 
 But I know I know I know I just need You

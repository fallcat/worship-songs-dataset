Those motel rooms are lonely places 
 Sometimes that Gideon's Bible is your only friend 
 You can change the channel 
 You can talk to her on the phone 
 But you hang up and you're alone there in the end 
 And You wonder if anyone's ever felt this way, 
 And you know they have, but you wonder what they would say 
 And when Jacob wrestles the angel, and winds up limping on that day, 
 A little bit of that old loneliness just goes away 
 When you turn the engine over the next morning 
 And it's on to the next motel room in the next town 
 And the miles stretch out 
 Like a long thin asphalt desert 
 And you're still five days from being homeward bound 
 But when Samson, he goes blind after his woman done him wrong 
 You figure, "Ah well, five days ain't really all that long." 
 And when Jesus raises up the dead and gives sight to the blind 
 You say now there's a man that I could get behind.

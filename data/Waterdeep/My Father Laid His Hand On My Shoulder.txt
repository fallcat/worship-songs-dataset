All the malice I've felt 
 Toward the people who've hurt me 
 Was a dark lonely hole 
 Where I ended up dirty 
 Trying to make sense 
 Of what's fair and what's ugly 
 So I drew my conclusions 
 And I stated them smugly 
 When the adrenaline rush 
 Of the wave of rage passes 
 And I'm cold in that hole 
 And there's mud on my glasses 
 I don't care anymore 
 To issue all my subpoenas 
 Or seek revenge on my foes 
 Fulfill my grave-like agreements 
 Though the world is a winter 
 Growing colder and colder 
 I remember the warmth 
 When my Father laid His hand on my shoulder 
 When my Father laid His hand on my shoulder 
 In my nightmares I've seen 
 All the wrath and destruction 
 Of my dark enemy 
 And his lethal deduction 
 That if I've ever felt helpless 
 If I've ever felt fearful 
 Then he had right to accuse 
 Pierce my side with his spear full 
 But when I was shamefully weak 
 And knew I should have been bolder 
 I was strengthened again 
 When my Father laid His hand on my shoulder 
 When my Father laid His hand on my shoulder 
 It's not my duty to judge 
 There's another who does so 
 I am asked to forgive 
 To release and to trust though 
 It's not my duty to die for the 
 Sins I've committed 
 I'm allowed to run free 
 I've been fully acquitted 
 All the days of my life 
 And when I'm years and years older 
 I'll remember the day 
 When my Father laid His hand on my shoulder 
 All the days of my life 
 And when I'm years and years older 
 I'll remember the day 
 When my Father laid His hand on my shoulder 
 When my Father laid His hand on my shoulder

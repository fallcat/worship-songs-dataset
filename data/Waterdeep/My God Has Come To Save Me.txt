On the day God saved us 
 The people all sang 
 Praise the Father of Heaven 
 He was angry with me 
 But now He comforts me 
 Oh, how He comforts me 
 My God has come to save me 
 I will trust Him and not be afraid 
 My God has come to save me 
 He is my strength and my song 
 We will drink from the fountain 
 Where salvation springs 
 All the people will shout 
 Praise to our King 
 Tell the nations about it 
 And help them to see 
 He's the maker of Heaven 
 He's over everything 
 He's over everything 
 My God loves everything 
 My God has come to save me 
 I will trust Him and not be afraid 
 My God has come to save me 
 He is my strength and my song 
 On the day God saved us 
 The people all sang 
 Praise the Father of Heaven 
 He was angry with me 
 But now He comforts me 
 Oh, how He comforts me 
 My God has come to save me 
 I will trust Him and not be afraid 
 My God has come to save me 
 He is my strength and my song 
 My God is come to save me 
 I will trust Him and not be afraid 
 My God has come to save me 
 He is my strength and my song 
 He is my strength and my song 
 He is my strength and my song

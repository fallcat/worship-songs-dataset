She plays with my words like they were hers 
 Little soldiers in a war against themselves 
 She used to rob me of my own intent 
 But now I'm keeping my findings from her shelves 
 I used to think that honesty was all 
 Between the two of us, nothing should go unsaid 
 Then she taught me, although I took too long 
 That some things should be said to God and then just left for dead 
 I've got to learn to live alone 
 Just lean into the Wing 
 I've got to know that there is only One 
 For whom I sing 
 I've got to learn the difference 
 Between me and this place 
 Got to let my little hands 
 Reach only for Your face 
 I've felt the pressing of listening 
 I've known an empathetic overload 
 I've been a mile in so many other shoes 
 I forgot my own out on the road 
 But I'm coming now to understand 
 That where my heart is, there's my treasure 
 And the suffering that I am going through 
 Will be replaced with a glory that I can't even measure

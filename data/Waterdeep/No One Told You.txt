Your momma's drunk 
 You sister went insane 
 You been trying to keep from getting sick 
 Standing in the pouring rain 
 No one told you 
 That it would be this hard 
 And that it'd hurt so bad inside 
 Cause no one ever 
 Really gets to know 
 We're all on the same dark ride 
 But when the ending comes 
 Will you choose to live 
 Or will you choose to die? 
 The girl you love 
 You've tried to tell her that 
 That you love her so 
 But if she's supposed 
 To love you back 
 She doesn't seem to know 
 Just to be fair 
 It should be stated that 
 It's not always this way 
 Once in a while 
 From behind your back 
 You can hear somebody say 
 "No one told you 
 That I am really here 
 But I have been all along 
 And I know your sky 
 Is far from clear 
 And that it has been far too long 
 But when the ending comes 
 "I already did, so you don't have to die."

Northern ticket on a south bound train 
 He rolls his own 
 Some leaves and some paper his only refrain 
 He's blowing smoke 
 Daddy's the lord of the sugar cane 
 And a winning colt 
 Skittish and hamstrung at the gate 
 Bet on as a joke 
 Ride on 
 Through the dawn 
 He's gone 
 And he may never make it back home 
 Straight through 
 It'll break you 
 Take two 
 Won't begin until you get thrown into a lake like a stone 
 Loose fitting suit on a juvenile 
 Almost a man 
 His brother he snapped like a crocodile 
 He joined a band 
 Now, he gets by on talk radio 
 He's so polite 
 Up in the morning and away he goes 
 To catch a flight on time

My father told me never to fear 
 All of the darkness that I see down here 
 He said not to worry, you'll be okay 
 Just don't become a part of the deadly game 
 And if you're troubled by all the hate 
 Don't look aside, stare it in the face 
 You can love them like you should 
 Love all the people that have so misunderstood 
 Don't wait for the night to fall in on you 
 There's not enough time 
 Your simple please are not enough 
 To keep the rain from pouring in 
 The mindless stone your clinging to 
 Will turn into a boulder 
 It barely rests above your head 
 So soon it will be falling 
 Don't wait for the night to fall in on you 
 There's not enough time 
 The little stone you bow down to 
 Can never calm your anger 
 Millions of charms that "detour harm" 
 Can't make your joy forever 
 The stars just fall down from the sky 
 No wish you make will be granted 
 Don't wait for the night to fall in on you 
 There's not enough time

O Virginia 
 You been trailin' off too fast 
 You laid your dress down 
 In that old Kentucky grass 
 You said your baby was the prince of Persia 
 All he did was worship you 
 Do you remember what your daddy told you 
 When he would hold you 
 And when everything was going hazy 
 Did you ever think that this is crazy now? 
 O but even though you missed the warning 
 There's a mercy born on every morning 
 O Virginia 
 You been on the road too long 
 You learned the grinding 
 Yeah but you forgot the song 
 In your memory it's the angels falling 
 And the men all calling you 
 And when you answer at the door, you're there 
 Ready to share 
 But O Virginia, there's nothing left 
 In the war between the blame and pity 
 Your words were smooth, but your teeth were gritty, girl 
 Cause you wouldn't lay down your defenses, 
 And admit the way you killed your senses 
 When everything was going hazy 
 You did not believe that this is crazy now 
 And, Virginia, though you missed the warning 
 The angels wept and prayed for mourning 
 O Virginia 
 That young sweet and tender girl

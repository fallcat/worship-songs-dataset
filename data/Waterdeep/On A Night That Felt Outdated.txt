Well, this night just feels outdated 
 It's a tired reminder of the bad 
 Whe you held on to what you hated 
 And you hated what you had 
 And your mind was out on the corner 
 Sellin' herself as something cheap 
 Your pride he says he owns her 
 And she's dumb, she follows like a sheep 
 She don't know what he does to a lover 
 He'll whisper lies in a restless ear 
 He tells a wife she don't deserve to hover 
 Over a man who doesn't seem to hear 
 Some things are easy to forget, even if they're bigger than the now 
 And she has tried to remember them but she can't remember how 
 So she lies on her bed staring up at the cracks in the ceiling 
 She's even pinched herself to wake up, but her body's got no feeling 
 Well he calls her out on the driveway 
 He's pullin' her by her hips 
 He says you ought to come by my way 
 And he kisses her on the lips 
 His mouth feels cold to her heart 
 Unlike her man who's still asleep in their bed 
 But she numbs herself to that part 
 And she leans to what she calls her head 
 And though her face had turned away for a moment 
 And her eyes had flashed a bit with doubt 
 She felt the tug of a brilliant showman 
 And she was on her way out 
 It wasn't long before she was out sellin' on the corner like something cheap 
 On a night that could feel like hell in the reminders that it made you keep 
 Like the one where you were standin' on the driveway 
 There was a cold feeling on your lips 
 Some woman's saying to ya come my way 
 And she's pullin' you by your hips 
 But the prodigal did not stay way 
 There was a destiny he had to keep 
 And I may give my mind a dirty day 
 But tonight I got floors to sweep 
 Some things are easy to forget, even if they're bigger than the now 
 And you have tried to remember them but you can't remember how 
 So you lie on your bed staring at the cracks in the ceiling 
 You've even pinched yourself to wake up, but your body's got no feel

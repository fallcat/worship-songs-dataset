There's a crazy girl in Santa Fe 
 That Allan used to see 
 She got mad one day and threw his things 
 Out the window violently 
 There's a park where she hangs out now 
 With the hookers and the bums 
 Ain't it wild how quick it changes 
 From the suburbs to the slums 
 Almost no one slides on purpose 
 No one sells their soul for free 
 But once we love the things that hurt us 
 We're on our way to crazy 
 On our way to crazy 
 There's a deep and howling darkness 
 That is tucked into the film 
 In between the flickers of her body 
 Milky white and slim 
 It's a loneliness translated 
 Into sex and back again 
 But the meaning gets all muddled 
 When she thinks he is her friend 
 And the black hole of attraction 
 That just follows her along 
 It looks all rich and sumptuous 
 But it always feels wrong 
 And "The contents they don't matter 
 It's appearance that is key" 
 That's the mantra that she mutters 
 By the glow of the TV 
 Now you've followed down the spiral 
 To its deadly final point 
 Where you think the reason you was born 
 Was just to dirty up the joint 
 Now remember how it used to feel 
 How everything would work 
 Back before you lost control 
 Back when the steering wheel jerked

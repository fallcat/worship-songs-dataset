Oh Lord my heart is not lifted up 
 My eyes are not raised to high for Thee 
 I do not think on things to great or marvelous 
 Or matters too difficult for me 
 But I have calmed and quieted my soul 
 Like a weaned child is my soul within me 
 I have calmed and quieted my soul 
 Like a weaned child with its mother is my soul within me 
 O Israel trust in the Lord 
 From this time forth and forevermore 
 O Israel trust in the Lord 
 From this time forth and forevermore

I call to the Lord who is worthy of praise 
 And all my enemies don't know where to face 
 The cords of death have entangled my feet 
 I cried to You and from your temple 
 You heard me and you rescued me 
 He rode down on the wings of 
 Dark clouds were a canopy around him 
 He shot his arrows and he scattered my foes 
 With bolts of lightening they all became exposed 
 So I'll sing alleluia 
 Alleluia 
 Praise the Lord 
 You, O Lord keep my lamp burning bright 
 My God turns my darkness into light 
 With my God I can scale a wall 
 With your help, I can win a war and not even fall 
 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer 
 And lets me stand on the heights high above my fears 
 He makes the path broad beneath my feet 
 So my ankles don't turn and ruin me

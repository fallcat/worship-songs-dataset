 Got to restore 
 Got to restore 
 Got to restore 
 Got to restore 
 Sometimes it's late at night 
 I'm thinkin' but I'm not quite 
 There. Everywhere that I turn 
 It's a county fair 
 This booth, that booth, I'm everything that's uncouth 
 And I can't keep nothing straight except my front tooth 
 Late night NPR 
 Programming'll go far 
 Listenin to Kerouac 
 In a French Quarter bar 
 I was not a beatnik 
 I didn't do the speed 
 But I could get high on the pages I'd read 
 Oh, got to restore 
 Oh, got to restore 
 Oh, got to restore 
 Oh, got to restore 
 I get fascinated by the strangest things 
 And my wife has to deal with my wide mood swings 
 Some nights are mellow 
 Some nights are okay 
 But I don't want things to just stay this way 
 I left the bacon fryin in a pan last night 
 I heard a baby cryin in the man inside 
 Untended, unmended, my needs are open-ended 
 But I believe you can heal the way I feel 
 The river I'm thinking of 
 Doesn't have a stink above 
 The water from the waste that's been dumped therein 
 This river is crystal, not method, not madness 
 The river is rolling, and the river is life 
 Now I ain't being funny 
 And I ain't being queer 
 I'm gonna say it simple 
 And I'm gonna say it clear 
 The bridegroom is coming 
 The bridegroom is coming 
 Are you ready to be a member of his wife? 
 Now, let me take you to a place 
 Farther than outer space 
 Everything is different 
 And you love it that way 
 Every tear is dried up 
 Every demon tied up 
 Nothing of the aching is around out here 
 All the things you hated 
 Have all been decimated 
 Even those things inside of you 
 No more being worried 
 And no more being bored 
 Everything ever lost has been restored 
 Restoration 
 Restoration 
 Restoration 
 Restoration

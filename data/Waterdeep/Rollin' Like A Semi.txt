Everyone is hungry, baby 
 Everyone in sight 
 Everyone is groping, honey 
 In the middle of the night 
 Lies and altercations, Johnny 
 Federal Offense 
 Swinging for the bleachers, buddy 
 You hit the foul side fence 
 Rolling like a semi, brother 
 Diesel runnin' low 
 Try to make your destination 
 Try to make the show 
 I see it on your face now sister, 
 Skin all fake and tight 
 You're smiling like an alley cat, dear 
 And it doesn't look quite right 
 And we all try to break it down 
 Into our religious code 
 We're deluded by the thought that maybe one day 
 We will have paid back what we owed 
 You roll it like a joint now, sister 
 Breathe every page in deep 
 And wonder when the blues will fade out 
 And why the high won't keep 
 Lean, brother, lean 
 Get the weight off of your feet 
 Let the judgment overtake you 
 And then find the mercy seat

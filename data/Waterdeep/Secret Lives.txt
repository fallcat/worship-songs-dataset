Everybody's got their secret lives 
 Yeah 
 All the way from the ocean to the desert 
 A million stories dying to be heard 
 But once they open up their mouths 
 They know they will never be the same again

 From the things he's done 
 In dark and private places

 And the thing that doctor said 
 Can't get it out her head 
 So she cries 
 Maybe it won't be the same 
 But what is there to lose 
 That you can hold on to 
 I mean really hold on to

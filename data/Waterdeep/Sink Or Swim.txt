Will you hold my hand? 
 Do I have to stand in this world all alone 
 Where it's icy cold 
 And all the people chime in 
 "You've got to sink or swim"? 
 Where there's rain there's drought, 
 So I'll confess my doubts. 
 Where there's threshing of the fields 
 Something's bound to yield. 
 And all the people cry out, 
 They feel they're about to drown 
 On the ocean floor 
 But I know there's more 
 I know You understand what it's like to me man 
 Sometimes I forget You're near 
 Sometimes I forget you hear 
 The way the raindrops fall, 
 The sound of the wind as it calls, 
 And every breath I breathe 
 And song I don't sing

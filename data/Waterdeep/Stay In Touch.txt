Here are the keys to my kingdom 
 Take her for a drive 'round the block 
 The brakes might squeal but just ignore that sound 
 And promise me you'll stay in touch with the ground 
 Every single thing I gave to Cindy 
 She took it, smiled and promised me her love 
 Well, don't trust Cindy, even if she frowns 
 And promise me you'll stay in touch with the ground 
 Move around 
 Stay on the ground 
 No, really this isn't all just Cindy's fault 
 And maybe she was just along for the ride 
 Most things in my life have to do with how I'm bound 
 To my promises to stay in touch with the ground 
 'Cause promises are only mercenary troops (that's right) 
 They bear no real allegiance to the soil (that's right) 
 When they fight they always look around (that's right) 
 They have never really been in touch with the ground 
 Last time we went out for dinner, she told me 
 That I had disappointed her 
 She said of all of the things that you could have shown me 
 The ones you chose were peculiar 
 I just smiled and called for the check 
 And I said, honey, let's just call this thing a wreck

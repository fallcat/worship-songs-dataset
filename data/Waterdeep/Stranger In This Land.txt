I spent too much time today 
 On things that don't mean much 
 The world around me groans under it's tyranny of touch 
 Every wasted thought 
 And every battle left unfought 
 All are testimony to my need of you 
 I'm a stranger in this land 
 Won't you take me by the hand 
 I can hear that distant band 
 But I'm still a stranger in this land 
 Somedays at the strangest times 
 I feel a sense of loss 
 A bite or two of stolen fruit 
 And we all suffer from the cost 
 But every longing for my home 
 Even when I'm not alone 
 Stands as testimony of the coming day 
 All I've got to do 
 Is to believe on You 
 Then every struggle seems worthwhile 
 I can see the promise of Your smile

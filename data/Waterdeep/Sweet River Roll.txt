Homebound Henry's got a tumor in his head 
 He wakes up every morning after dreaming he was dead 
 He used to think that life was boring, but now that's not the case 
 He turns to his wife in the evening, he says "Honey I'm afraid I'm gonna lose this race." 
 Sweet River, roll all over me 
 Sweet River, roll all over me 
 Soaking wet Juliet- she lives in a well full of tears 
 Her husband left her for some bimbo after twenty-two years 
 Now she's got to start all over, but she's just so terrified 
 She thinks it woulda been so much easier if he woulda just died 
 And I'm lookin' out my car window sittin' in the pouring rain 
 Although your house is fifteen miles away, I can still feel your pain 
 I've thought and prayed and worked it through about a hundred times or more 
 How your soul just cries to everyone to help you get up off the floor 
 Right now it's morning, you're probably totally unaware 
 Of the flood of kisses you hold back by the way that you despair 
 It ain't me I'm talking about here, or anybody else you can touch 
 That's all I want to say right now, I don't want to say too much 
 Except Sweet Jesus, roll all over me 
 Sweet Jesus, roll all over me... 
 You gotta come down and just set me free

 1/27-2/8/99 Wichita, KS 
 We're gonna take Jericho 
 By blowin' them horns 
 We're gonna take Jericho 
 By blowin' them horns 
 Cause that's what my Lord said to do 
 We're gonna take Jericho 
 By blowin' them horns 
 We're gonna lift Him up 
 When we're way way down 
 We're gonna lift Him up 
 When we're on the ground 
 Cause that's what my Lord said to do 
 We're gonna lift Him up 
 When we're way way down 
 We can see Jericho coming 
 Down down down down down 
 Come on, brother, blow your horn 
 Cause you know that Jericho is coming 
 Down down down down down down down down down 
 We're gonna cross that sea 
 Walkin' on dry land 
 We're gonna cross that sea 
 Walkin' on dry land 
 Cause that's what my Lord said to do 
 We're gonna cross that sea 
 Walkin' on dry land

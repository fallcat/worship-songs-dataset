You set the table in your spirit 
 Entertain the devil for a while 
 And then you laugh at all his jokes 
 Insisting it's all right- 
 It's okay to smile 
 But you are 
 Dancing with the demons 
 And walking on the wall that borders hell 
 Thinking "Right now, I'm not testing God," 
 But always wondering how you'd feel if you just fell? 
 I'd like to say that it was simple 
 Like a dog you don't want pregnant so you fix her 
 But it's a matter of unconscious sin 
 I don't know if you know it, but you're been brewin' up a strychnine elixer 
 Because you're 
 Are you walking darkly 
 To avoid the razor light? 
 Did you lose the taste of flesh and blood 
 When you threw up late last night? 
 Is your soul in some fine limbo 
 Between bitterness and lust? 
 Can you talk about the cross these days 
 Without wincing in disgust?

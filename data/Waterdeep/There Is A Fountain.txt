Who on earth can satisfy my soul, 
 Who on earth can comfort me and love me like You do, 
 Who on earth can be more faithful and true, 
 I will trust in You, I will trust in You my God 
 There is a fountain 
 Who is a king 
 Victorious Warrior and Lord of Everything 
 My Rock, My Shelter 
 My very own 
 Precious Redeemer who reigns upon the throne 
 Who could ever be more faithful and true 
 Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, 
 Lord Jesus, there's none like You

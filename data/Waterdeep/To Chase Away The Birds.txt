Black crows flying in your wheat field 
 Babies cryin', all you got's a paper shield 
 It don't make much sense to you 
 Who said it had to? 
 Most folks smile away the blues 
 I mean I... I guess they do 
 You never really know for sure 
 But I'm surviving on this hunch that everybody else is hurtin' too 
 He was crazy 
 Crazy but able 
 So he excused himself from cleaning up the stable 
 This is the way that horses die 
 This is the way you learn to lie- 
 By sacrificing the real and forgetting how to feal 
 I loved him like fire 
 We both had similar burning desires 
 He kept expecting it all to work out down here 
 I just hang on to holy fear 
 Now I know how far out I'm getting here 
 But it's a dark night walk- the life of fear 
 And I'm trying to choose the words 
 That'll chase away the birds 
 Good God, just hurry up and come down here

Two gunslingers, walked out in the street 
 And one said "I don't wanna fight no more" 
 And the other gunslinger thought about it 
 And he said, "yeah what are we fighting for?" 
 I'm takin' control of my life, 
 I'm takin' control of my life 
 I'm takin' control of my life now, 
 Right now, oh yeah 
 Well the crowd that assembled 
 For the gun fight were let down 
 Everyone hissed and booed 
 And a stranger told his Mrs. 
 That's the last one of these gunfights 
 You're ever gonna drag me to 
 I'm takin' control of my life, 
 I'm takin' control of my life 
 I'm takin' control of my life now, 
 Right now, oh yeah 
 Well the two gunslingers 
 Went ridin' out of town and 
 Were never heard from no more 
 And there ain't been a gun fight 
 For a long time, maybe never 
 But nobody knows for sure 
 I'm takin' control of my life, 
 I'm takin' control of my life 
 I'm t akin' control of my life now, 
 Right now, oh yeah

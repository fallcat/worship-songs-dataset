Carrie was stretching out on the harbor 
 She was just trying to let it all go 
 Down came the rain and waves and thoughts of her father 
 Down came the old black hole 
 Carrie, don't go down there 
 We all know it's not fair 
 Even parents can lie 
 Carrie, don't close your eyes 
 And give way to the lies 
 That tell you you're all alone 
 Ruby came home from the store with a bottle 
 All of her dreams had been locked up inside 
 Since she was fourteen, she'd let out the throttle 
 And choked out her life 
 Ruby, don't look that way 
 You could start again today 
 You know your real Daddy smiles and smiles 
 Ruby, you know it's great- 
 Who you are- it's not too late 
 You're a child of the King 
 Kelly's been living under walls and tall shadows 
 She never lifted a finger to build 
 As for the sun well she can't seem to handle 
 That it brings to light to all she's killed 
 Kelly, don't look that way 
 It's time to come out and play 
 I know a safe sun to play in 
 Kelly, you look so frail 
 Like you've been in a jail 
 Pretty soon you will strengthen

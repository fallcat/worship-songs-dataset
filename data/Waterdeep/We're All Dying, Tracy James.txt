We're all dying, Tracy James 
 There's no need for naming names 
 'Cause we're all dying, somewhere out there crying 
 'Cause we're all dying, Tracy James 
 I have watched you as if you were on a skillet cooking 
 I am waiting for the moment to say something looking 
 Looking like an idiot. You are so beautiful 
 Beautiful but dying, Tracy James 
 I have hoped for something new and simple, virgin 
 I have stitched together people like a surgeon 
 Hoping like a madman. You are so innocent 
 Innocent but dying, Tracy James 
 Ambulances and their bleeding sirens 
 Books and all their stale pages 
 Smiles, but they're vain 
 We're all dying, Tracy James 
 I am seized now by how every soul dies stately 
 I am taken by the afterlife then lately 
 Taken like a captive by a truth that will not let me go 
 We must live forever, Tracy James 
 Cause We're all dying, Tracy James 
 There's no need for taking pains 
 To catalog the sins and blames 
 There must be some much greater Name 
 Who sees the struggle and the shame 
 We all live forever, Tracy James 
 We all live forever, Tracy James 
 Live forever, Tracy James 
 Each one named by her name

When the cold wind blows all around 
 Will You still love me, still love me? 
 When the cold wind blows all around 
 Will You still love me? 
 When the lightning crashes 
 Hopes are dashed and I am asking 
 How this comes to me and why 
 When no home on Earth can be found 
 Will You still love me, still love me? 
 When no home on Earth can be found 
 Will You still love me? 
 When You left us last time 
 You said You'd return 
 And I'm sorry that it 
 Takes so long to learn 
 That my hope is to walk forever 
 In the coolness of the day 
 Oh, my hope is to walk forever 
 In the coolness of the day 
 When no home on Earth can be found 
 You will still love? 
 When the cold wind blows all around 
 You will still love me?

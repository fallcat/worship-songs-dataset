Do do do do do etc. 
 (Don) 
 Whenever God shined a light on me 
 He opened up my eyes so I could see 
 When I look up in the darkest night 
 Then I know that everything' gonna be all right 
 (Laurie) 
 In deep confusion and great despair 
 When I reach out for Him, He is there 
 When I'm lonely as I can be 
 Then I know that God shines His light on me 
 Reach out for help and He'll be there 
 With Him your troubles you can share 
 And if you live the life of love 
 You'll get the blessing from above 
 (Don) 
 Well He heals the sick and He heals the lame 
 So you can do it too in Jesus name 
 (Laurie) 
 He'll lift you up and turn you around 
 And he'll put your feet back (feet back) on higher ground 
 Do do do do do do doo etc. 
 Do do do do do do doo etc.

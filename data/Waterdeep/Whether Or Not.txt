This morning when the sun came up, 
 I was still lyin' down in my bed. 
 But it started burning real bright 
 Whether or not 
 It was shining on my head. 
 Just today another flower bloomed 
 And I just walked right on by. 
 It became a little swirl of fantasy 
 Whether or not 
 It caught my eye. 
 I could just go round bein down, sleepin' late, 
 Runnin' round in a state, feelin' dead in the head 
 Cause of all the things that people said. 
 But none of them can get inside of me. 
 I think I'd rather just decide not to hide 
 From the facts of the dark and relax cause the spark 
 Of the fire that's inside me isn't goin' out. 
 The darkness just ain't gonna swallow me 
 (Because I'm gonna live eternally.) 
 I think about myself so much, 
 It kinda makes me ill. 
 I probly oughta let my cup 
 Just fill up 
 But overfill.

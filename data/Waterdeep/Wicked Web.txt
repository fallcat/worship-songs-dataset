You told me you had money coming down the way 
 "Can I borrow fifty bucks, man, just to get me through the day" 
 You promised you were free this time of all of your old ways 
 But I bought your story last time, and I can't afford to buy today 
 And I think I see the drummers now 
 They're coming down the road 
 They're striking up a funeral beat 
 They heard you're getting old 
 I know you. You ain't fought 'em 
 You let 'em play the song 
 Then you fell in step when they asked you 
 If you wanted to come along 
 What a wicked web we weave 
 When first we practice to deceive 
 Spinnin out a house of make-believe 
 We're like a serpent on the ear of Eve 
 Well, brother if you mean to tell the truth 
 You better improve your diction 
 Cause the words that you been letting slide 
 Are definitely fiction 
 I been lookin' for a place 
 To lay my sorrow down 
 And I found out where to lay your lies 
 Up on that dying ground 
 God knows what your debt has cost 
 It's already been paid 
 On a Roman cross, a screaming man 
 And a cave where He was laid

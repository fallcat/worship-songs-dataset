Lord, when You lift Your voice 
 It's like no other voice I have known 
 Lord, when You lift Your hand 
 All the kingdoms of earth silent go 
 And when You say the word 
 Every sickness is cured 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 Lord, when You call my name 
 Wherever You say I will go 
 Lord, when You come again 
 Every person will know 
 And when You show Your face 
 No one will stay the same 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 Lord, when You sing Your song 
 All of creation will know 
 Lord, when You show Your strength 
 Let justice and righteousness flow 
 When we see Your holiness 
 Every tongue will confess 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 (You are lovely) 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 You are lovely 
 Lord, when You lift Your voice 
 It's like no other voice I've known

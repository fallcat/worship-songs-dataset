You are so good to me 
 You heal my broken heart 
 You are my Father in heaven 
 You are so good to me 
 You heal my broken heart 
 You are my Father in heaven 
 You ride upon the clouds 
 You lead me to the truth 
 You are the Spirit inside me 
 You ride upon the clouds 
 You lead me to the truth 
 You are the Spirit inside me 
 You poured out all your blood 
 You died upon the cross 
 You are my Jesus who loves me 
 You poured out all your blood 
 You died upon the cross 
 You are my Jesus who loves me 
 You are beautiful my sweet, sweet, song 
 You are beautiful my sweet, sweet, song 
 You are beautiful my sweet, sweet, song 
 I will sing again 
 You are my strong melody 
 You are my dancing rhythm 
 You are my perfect rhyme 
 And I want to sing forever

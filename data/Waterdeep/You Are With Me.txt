By Don Chaffer 
 Tomorrow seems like a long ways away 
 But it will come 
 Just like any other day 
 There you will be standing at the gates 
 Standing at the gate ready to welcome me in 
 Deep inside where the wounded creatures hide I am afraid 
 Maybe I got lost somewhere along the way 
 Somehow please rescue me 
 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil 
 Fear no evil 
 For You are with me

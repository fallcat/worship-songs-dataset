In a crazy haze 
 In a purple robe 
 I walk amaze 
 King of the strobe 
 Flashing and unfaithful 
 I'm hardly light at all 
 Tripping and ungraceful 
 I was born into the fall 
 You knew 
 You knew 
 I've never been true 
 I'm true in You 
 You knew 
 At the stretch of dawn 
 In the yawn of time 
 You thought upon me 
 With Your bread and wine 
 But how my blood is hardened 
 I fear of losing life 
 Do drown me in Your heart and 
 Say I'll be Your wife 
 You knew 
 You knew 
 Before I was true 
 I was true in You 
 You knew

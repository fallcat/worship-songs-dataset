The winter of emotions 
 Sometimes steals into my head 
 It's the tundra of the shutdown 
 It's the burying the dead 
 And I'd like to make my springtime 
 But I have no read recourse 
 But to wait on some long loving 
 From some deep and pure source 
 You lay me down 
 You whisper somehow 
 I can hear it when I'm very still 
 You don't ever touch me or chase away the chill 
 But one day soon, you will 
 The art of all my problems 
 Is in how they're resolved 
 I try until I'm hopeless 
 And then a hand so soft 
 Is brushing back my hair 
 From its clinging to my face 
 From crying God I live in 
 Such a weak and desperate place

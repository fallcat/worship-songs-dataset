By Lori Chaffer 
 You cause my heart to sing 
 You are always listening 
 You understand my dreams 
 You do 
 You cut away my lies 
 You see through my disguise 
 You are not so far away from me 
 As I thought You'd be 
 You love me as I am 
 Even when I cannot stand 
 You whisper in my ear 
 All the things I need to hear 
 From You 
 You are a mystery 
 You bring strong men to their knees 
 You change the hearts of kings 
 You do 
 You have names for all Your stars 
 You heal my wounds and kiss my scars 
 You sing a million songs over me

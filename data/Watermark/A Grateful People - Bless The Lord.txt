It is time that we give you honor 
 This is the day to give you 
 All the praise that you deserve 
 Yes, it's time to give you honor 
 This is the day to give you 
 All the praise that you deserve 
 A Holy King, of everything 
 Inhabit the praises of Your people 
 A Holy King, of everything 
 Inhabit the praises of Your people 
 Have we waited far too long to surrender 
 Forgive us Oh God the years 
 We failed to seek your face 
 Oh Lord, your mercy turns us into 
 Grateful people 
 We can't seem to find the words 
 So take our lives that there might be enough 
 To tell you how grateful 
 Lord, we are grateful 
 (Repeat all) 
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul 
 (He has done great things) 
 And all that is within me 
 (He had done great things) 
 Bless His holy name 
 (Repeat 3x)

Blue skies will take me back into being a child, 
 Trees with leaves that turn the colors I love, 
 A heart that beating to your melodies ringing, 
 And I am a miracle 'cause heaven is a part of me. 
 You are the song that I am singing... 
 I was created to love you, 
 I was created to need you, (ohoh) 
 I was created to know you, (oooyeah) 
 And I am a miracle 'cause heaven is a part of me. 
 You are the air that I am breathing... 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things pure, (ohoh) 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things true, (oh) 
 You make all things new... all things new 
 I was created to love you, (ohoh) 
 I was created to need you, 
 I was created to know you, (oooyeah) 
 And I am a miracle 'cause heaven is a part of me. 
 You are the air that I am breathing... 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things pure, (ohyeah) 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things true, (whohoo) 
 You make all things new... 
 And I'm so thankful for this life that I know, 
 That I am no longer what I was, 
 Because of your love and the beauty of the cross, 
 I can see your work in me! 
 All things new, all things new in me! 
 You make all things new, all things new in me! (ohyeah) 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things pure, (ohyeah) 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things true, (ohooyeah) 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things pure, (ohyeah) 
 Because of who you are and who I am in you, 
 You make all things true, (ohyeah) 
 You make all things new... 
 All things new 
 All things new (ohooyeah)

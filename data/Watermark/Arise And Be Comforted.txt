Arise and be comforted 
 For the Lord, He is good to the weary 
 And even the young heart can tire and fall 
 But He knows them all 
 For the Lord, He will renew their strength 
 And they will soar on wings as eagles 
 And they will run and never grow weary 
 They will walk and not grow faint 
 For the Lord, He is good 
 Lift your eyes to the heavens 
 For the creator is living in you 
 Come surrender as you are 
 And know that you'll never stray too far 
 Let His power within you heal your heart 
 Lift your eyes to spacious skies 
 Let Him chart your way to flight 
 Spread your wings and fly 
 For the Lord, He is good 
 (Repeat all)

Caught in a whirlwind or two. 
 Divinly, my sail caught the winds of you, 
 And changed my point of view. 
 Never hopelessly lost, you see. 
 Spirit wind set its course for me. 
 And calmed the waters of a troubled soul. 
 Pulled the anchor from the depths below. 
 Set a horizon of direction 
 In this heart of mine. 
 You show me right where you're blowing. 
 And life comes from loving and knowing. 
 The spirit has breathed this life in me. 
 And I never caught wind of anything 
 Quite so amazing. 
 You have breathed your life in me, 
 La la la la la la la la. 
 Ooh, la la la la la la la la. 
 And out of this spirit wind, 
 Comes a breeze that becomes more like a friend. 
 And I've felt it time and time again. 
 Whisper words of a healing prayer. 
 When I'm lost, it's a compass to get me there. 
 You calm the waters of a troubled soul. 
 You've pulled the anchor from the depths below. 
 You set a horizon of direction 
 In this heart of mine. 
 You've shown me right where you're blowing. 
 And life comes from loving and knowing. 
 The spirit has breathed this life in me. 
 And I've never caught wind of anything 
 Quite so amazing. 
 You have breathed your life in me, 
 La la la la la la la la. 
 Whoa, whoa, la la la la la la la, woo 
 La da da da da da woo woo. 
 Mmmmm, la la la la la la la la.

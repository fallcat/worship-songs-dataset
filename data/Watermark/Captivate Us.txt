Your face is beautiful 
 And Your eyes are like the stars 
 Your gentle hands have healing 
 There inside the scars 
 Your loving arms they draw me near 
 And Your smile it brings me peace 
 Draw me closer oh my Lord 
 Draw me closer Lord to Thee 
 Captivate us, Lord Jesus 
 Set our eyes on You 
 Devastate us with Your presence 
 Falling down 
 And rushing river, draw us nearer 
 Holy fountain consume us with You 
 Captivate us Lord Jesus, with You 
 Your voice is powerful 
 And Your words are radiant bright 
 In Your breath and shadow 
 I will come close and abide 
 You whisper love and life divine 
 And Your fellowship is free 
 Draw me closer O my Lord 
 Draw me closer Lord to Thee 
 Let everything be lost in the shadows 
 Of the light of Your face 
 Let every chain be broken from me 
 As I'm bound in Your grace 
 For Your yoke is easy, Your burden is light 
 You're full of wisdom, power and might 
 And every eye will see You

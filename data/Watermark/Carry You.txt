The God of all creation orders all the universe 
 Every detail of the corners of the earth now (He covers) 
 And nothing comes between His mighty hand 
 Nothing can surprise Him 'cause He knows all about you 
 Every detail of the corners of your heart now (He loves You) 
 And nothing you can do can take that from you 
 Let love carry you, let His heart cover you 
 Like a big, warm coat 
 So you can be warm whenever you're cold now 
 He goes before you now with a big, bright banner across this town 
 Saying, "here comes my child... here comes my child" 
 You'll never walk alone now 
 'Cause He loves to surround you 
 Your name is written on His hands and 
 On His heart now (He knows You) 
 And nothing you can do can take that from you! 
 Let love carry you, let His heart cover you 
 Like a big, warm coat 
 So you can be warm whenever you're cold now 
 He goes before you now with a big, bright banner across this town 
 Saying, "here comes my child... here comes my child" 
 Keep truth in whatever you do and His favor will rest on you 
 Keep hold of every promise He has given 
 Keep giving all of your life and be a living sacrifice 
 'Cause He's given you everything you need in Jesus, 
 Everything you need...

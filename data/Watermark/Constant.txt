You alone are wise 
 You alone are all consuming fire 
 And I want to press in to know 
 This God that so amazes me 
 You alone are good 
 You alone are the only good in me 
 And because of the work of the cross 
 You're pursued my life and You've loved me completely 
 You go after every heart 
 You won't rest until we know 
 You are constant, You are constant 
 You Go after every heart 
 And Your glory is in all the earth 
 But Your heart is for a people who 
 Will constantly be running after You 
 You alone are life 
 You alone are the only life I breathe 
 And because of Your unfailing love 
 My life will be spent to know you completely 
 You go after every heart 
 You won't rest until we know 
 You are constant, You are constant 
 You Go after every heart 
 And Your glory is in all the earth 
 But Your heart is for a people who 
 Will constantly be running after You 
 If I ever find my life, then I've lost it 
 For there is nothing more to life 
 Than to lose myself while I'm 
 Running, running, running 
 Running after You 
 You go after every heart 
 You won't rest until we know 
 You are constant, You are constant 
 You Go after every heart 
 And Your glory is in all the earth 
 But Your heart is for a people who 
 Will constantly be running after You

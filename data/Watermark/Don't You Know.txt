I have hidden you 
 I have set you apart and... 
 Saved the best for me... saved the best for me..(oh) 
 I love you that much that I would 
 Hold the things that you think you want and... 
 I'll give you the things that you really need... 
 Don't you know that I know you 
 Don't you know I know where you are 
 And all of heaven sings over you 
 Because of the depths of My love! 
 I love you with a love that you can not think of... no 
 I'm near you even though you feel far away... far away 
 I've rescued you and carried you 
 And caused your world to stop 
 Just so I could hear you say that You love me too! 
 All of heaven sings over you...(4x)

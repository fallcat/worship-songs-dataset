Baby woman, tiny in stature now 
 But your heart is a treasure 
 Little princess come follow behind me now 
 I am reaching for you 
 Elliana, God has answered my prayers 
 Elliana, God will conquer my fears 
 To mother a daughter, to look you in the eye 
 To know that I had everything, to walk with you in life 
 To give you to Jesus that He would impart 
 The wisdom that I'm longing for to mother your heart 
 Elliana, God has answered my prayers 
 There will be others to lead and to guide you girl 
 But only one you'll call Mother, the honor is all mine 
 To show you what a woman's like 
 I'm so glad you're mine 
 Tenderness of God is twirling around 
 In our living room tonight 
 Lighten up your daddy's eyes 
 And know that he just wants to freeze you in time

Everything, Lord I bring everything 
 I lift my hands and show You what I bring 
 I bring You everything 
 Everything, Lord I bring everything 
 My heart rejoices and the angels sing 
 When I bring everything 
 (Repeat) 
 All of my heart I give 
 My life is to You an open door 
 Spirit, You're welcome to walk right through 
 And take with You... 
 Everything, Lord I bring everything... 
 (Repeat first part)

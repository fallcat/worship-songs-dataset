Friend for life 
 Who took my pain 
 The cleansing flood 
 You remain 
 Wash over me 
 Till I can't be seen 
 Living Water swallow me 
 Deepest river wash me clean 
 Jesus, Savior more of thee 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Come and ruin me with Your love 
 So no other is enough 
 Come and leave Your mark on me 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Friend for life 
 I'll carry on 
 Through the power 
 Of this flood 
 Let it spill over, over 
 Till I can't be seen 
 Living Water swallow me 
 Deepest river wash me clean 
 Jesus, Savior more of thee 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Come and ruin me with Your love 
 So no other is enough 
 Come and leave Your mark on me 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Deep is the stain 
 Inside of me 
 But deeper the river 
 That washes me clean 
 I've been the one 
 Who cries in the night 
 But you've been 
 The friend of my life 
 Living Water swallow me 
 Deepest river wash me clean 
 Jesus, Savior more of thee 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Come and ruin me with Your love 
 So no other is enough 
 Come and leave Your mark on me 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Jesus, more of thee 
 Jesus, more of thee

I wish I could crash like the waves 
 Or turn like the autumn leaves 
 In effort to praise You 
 I wish I could smell like the forest 
 The fragrance lifting a mighty chorus 
 In effort to praise You 
 In effort to praise You 
 But I'm such a limited creature 
 And my word can only paint so many pictures 
 But somewhere I think I read that I am 
 Treasured over all creation 
 So I know that I must try 
 I wish I could roll like the thunder 
 To leave the earth below in wonder 
 In effort to praise You 
 I wish I could fall like the summer rain 
 And every drop would sing Your name 
 In effort to praise You 
 In effort to praise You 
 Gloria, glory in the highest 
 Forever I will hide myself in Thee (2x) 
 Every breath that I breathe 
 Every moment in my history 
 Is an effort to praise You 
 An effort to praise You 
 Glory in the highest 
 Forever I will hide myself in Thee 
 Oh, Gloria 
 Glory in excelsis deo 
 Gloria, gloria, gloria 
 Gloria, gloria, gloria

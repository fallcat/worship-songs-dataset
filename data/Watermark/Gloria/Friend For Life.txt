I wish I could crash like the waves 
 Or turn like the autumn leaves 
 In effort to praise You 
 I wish I could smell like the forest 
 The fragrance lifting a mighty chorus 
 In effort to praise You 
 In effort to praise You 
 But I'm such a limited creature 
 And my words can only paint so many pictures 
 But somewhere I think I read that I am 
 Treasured over all creation 
 So I know that I must try 
 I wish I could roll like the thunder 
 To leave the earth below in wonder 
 In effort to praise You, yeah 
 I wish I could fall like the summer rain 
 And every drop would sing Your name 
 In effort to praise You 
 In effort to praise You 
 Gloria, glory in the highest 
 Forever I will hide myself in Thee 
 Gloria, glory in excelsis deo 
 Gloria, Gloria 
 Every breath that I breathe 
 Every moment in my history 
 Is an effort to praise You 
 An effort to praise You 
 ... 
 Friend for life 
 Who took my pain 
 The cleansing flood 
 You remain 
 Wash over me 
 Till I can't be seen 
 Living water swallow me 
 Deepest river wash me clean 
 Jesus, savior more of Thee 
 Jesus, more of Thee 
 Come and ruin me with Your love 
 So no other is enough 
 Come and leave Your mark on me 
 Jesus, more of Thee 
 Jesus, more of Thee 
 Deep is the stain 
 Inside of me 
 But deeper the river 
 That washes me clean 
 I've been the one 
 Who cries in the night 
 But you've been 
 The friend of my life 
 Living water swallow me 
 Deepest river wash me clean 
 Jesus savior more of Thee 
 Jesus, more of Thee 
 Come and ruin me with Your love 
 So no other is enough 
 Come and leave Your mark on me 
 Jesus, more of Thee 
 Jesus, more of Thee

Glory Baby, You slipped away 
 As fast as we could say baby, baby 
 You were growing, what happened Dear, 
 You disappeared on us baby, baby 
 Heaven will hold you before we do 
 Heaven will keep you safe 
 Until we're home with you Until we're home with you 
 We miss you everyday, miss you in every way 
 But we know there's a day when we will hold you, we will hold you 
 And you'll kiss our tears away, when we're home to stay 
 *We can't wait for the day when we will see you, we will see you 
 But baby let sweet Jesus hold you, until mom and dad can hold you* 
 You'll just have heaven before we do 
 You'll just have heaven before we do 
 Sweet little baby, it's hard to understand it 
 'Cause we are hurting, we are hurting 
 But there is healing, and we know we're stronger people 
 Through the growing, and in knowing 
 All things work together for our good 
 And God works his purposes 
 Just like he said he would, just like he said he would 
 I can't imagine Heaven's lullabies 
 And what the must sound like 
 But I will rest in knowing 
 Heaven is your home 
 And it's all you'll ever know, all you'll ever know

You bring life to my bones 
 And a spring to my step 
 And a heart that knows what it means 
 To wait before You 
 Laughter into my house 
 And a time to sing and shout 
 And a heart that knows what it means 
 To really trust You... 
 And when the shadow of sorrow comes 
 I will fall on the only One I know 
 Is the Rock that won't be shaken... 
 'Cause it is good for me 
 To lay it down at Your feet 
 It is good for me to lay the good and bad 
 In Your hand, my God... 
 It is good for me 
 To lay it down at Your feet 
 It is good for me 
 You are the constant One 
 When my life is overwhelmed 
 And You stay the same when all around is changing 
 And, oh, how good it is, yeah 
 Just to know the life You give 
 And my song shall ever be 
 That my god is faithful... 
 And when the shadow of sorrow comes 
 I will fall on the only One I know 
 Is the Rock that won't be shaken... 
 And when I delight myself in You 
 You give me the desires of my heart, 
 When I confess that You know best 
 Peace flows like a river and joy comes in the morning...

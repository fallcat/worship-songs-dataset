I will call upon YOu Lord 
 For You are worthy to be praised 
 And You alone are deserving of my life 
 So this is who I am 
 A lover of a man who was scorned for sinners... 
 (Repeat) 
 And You, You win the war over me 
 So my worhsip will be a life that is hidden in You 
 Your life is setting me free 
 So my worship will be a life that is hidden in You 
 I will call upon You Lord 
 For You are worthy of my praise 
 And You alone are the center of my life 
 So this is who I am 
 Offered to the man who was broken for me... 
 Holy, holy my Sustainer 
 You save me from my enemies 
 You are where the weary worshiop 
 With lifted hands in Your covering... 
 Body and soul, spirit and truth, 
 Hidden in You Lord Jesus 
 Body and soul, spirit and truth, 
 Hidden in You Lord Jesus

Trees of life are blooming 
 Your word plants the seed 
 And we see it growing 
 Your kindness leading to repentance 
 We see traces of deliverance 
 Lord, thank You for mercy 
 Oh, can you hear it? 
 It's the song of the redeemed 
 The pursuit of passion for the One who set us free 
 Oh can you hear it? 
 We're crying out for more 
 So listen to our song 
 It's turning into a holy roar 
 A holy roar 
 Rivers of renewal 
 Spirit whisper a revival 
 And send us rushing 
 Lord send us rushing... 
 Open hearts with hopes of unity 
 We're servants to love in lost humanity 
 Lord send us reaching 
 Oh, can you hear it? 
 It's the song of the redeemed 
 The pursuit of passion for the One who set us free 
 Oh can you hear it? 
 We're crying out for more 
 So listen to our song 
 It's turning into a holy roar 
 A holy roar 
 And we come rejoicing and singing and crying out to You Lord 
 Can You hear the holy roar 
 As we respond to Who You are and all that You have done 
 Lord with our lives, with all that we are 
 We return to You, Oh God 
 You are holy God 
 We lay down our lives, our songs, these tears, Lord 
 Can You hear the holy roar? These cries, these prayers... 
 Can You hear the holy roar? Still hear the holy roar

Holy presence, gentle brush of angel's wings 
 Creatures strange, breathing heavenly breaths 
 Encircle the throne... still they are saying... 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 All of heaven is singing 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Who was, and is, and is to come 
 Mighty God, strong to save 
 Who can compare? 
 The earth is Yours, and all that's in it 
 Every knee will bow 
 And every tongue will sing... 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 All of heaven is singing 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Who was, and is, and is to come 
 May You be worshipped on the earth in this moment 
 As You are worshipped there in heaven at Your throne 
 All this time, even before, You've been worshipped 
 All this time, forever unending, You'll be worshipped 
 All creation singing... 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 All of heaven is singing 
 Holy, Holy, Holy 
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty 
 Who was, and is, and is to come 
 Who was, and is, and is to come 
 Who was, and is, and is to come

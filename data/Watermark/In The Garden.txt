I come to the garden alone 
 While the dew is still on the roses 
 And the voice I hear 
 Falling on my ears 
 The Son of God discloses 
 There is none like 
 No one else can touch my heart like you do 
 I could search for all eternity, Lord and find 
 There is none like you 
 You speak and the sound of your voice 
 Is so sweet the birds hush their singing 
 And the melody that you give me 
 Within my heart is ringing 
 You walk with me and you talk with me 
 And tell me I am Your own 
 And the joy we share as we tarry here 
 None of us has ever known

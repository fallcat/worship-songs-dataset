Incorruptible, indescribable 
 Salvation's calling... 
 When I was longing... 
 Now You're the strength that holds my life 
 With a love that will never die 
 And never fade like the flowers... 
 It is a love that stands forever! 
 Oh I am not redeemed by corruptible things 
 Not by silver, not by gold 
 And not by aimless tradition 
 But by the blood of God's sacred Son Jesus ... 
 Oh You alone are my living hope 
 And my inheritance is... 
 Incorruptible 
 Incomparable, inconceivable 
 Your plans for me... 
 Shall always be... 
 And for the day that You're revealed 
 My heart is forever sealed 
 With the promise of mercy... 
 And the hope of all Your glory! 
 Oh sacred Son 
 Who paid the price 
 Oh may I live a grateful life 
 That magnifies Your name forever!

Come, come in 
 Invade all You see of us 
 Any man, who'd walk Your road is welcomed here 
 And You're the only one 
 Jesus, come and walk the halls of this house 
 Tread this place and turn it inside out 
 With Your mercy... 
 Jesus, teach us the prayers that open these doors 
 Until Your light floods in and illuminates these floors 
 And let Your truth be on our steps and in these rooms 
 Jesus invade... 
 Reach, reach in 
 With the hand that heals all our suffering 
 Conquer all that is not of You 
 Bring Your spirit throught 
 As we fill these walls with Your praise 
 I call for angels 
 I call for mercy 
 I call for freedom 
 In the name of Jesus 
 In the name of Jesus

Darling, you should know by now 
 But I know I need to tell you how 
 I don't always have the words 
 But I pray that it's my heart you've heard 
 I love to hear your heart 
 Telling of your love 
 Telling me you'll stay forever 
 I thank you for your touch 
 And for loving me that much 
 To know the things I need to hear... 
 Remember I promised forever 
 Life brings change 
 But my promise is the same 
 And through these years we've been together 
 Life has made us grow 
 But through it all I know 
 No matter what may come 
 My heart was made for you forever 
 Darling I need to confess 
 It's hard to show my weakness 
 I want so much to show you strength 
 Without revealing everything 
 You know what I always say 
 "When your weak, your strong, to me" 
 It's another way of loving me 
 'Cause when I see your heart 
 I get carried through 
 The reasons why I fell in love with you 
 Remember I promised forever 
 Life brings change 
 But my promise is the same 
 And through these years we've been together 
 Life has made us grow 
 But through it all I know 
 No matter what may come 
 My heart was made for you forever 
 You've dreamed with me 
 Every dream came true 
 You've shared with me every emotion 
 Every tear and every loss 
 Every road that we have crossed 
 I have always found a home in you

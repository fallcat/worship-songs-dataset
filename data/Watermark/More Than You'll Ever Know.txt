Something brought you to my mind today 
 I thought about the funny ways you make me laugh 
 And yet I feel like its okay to cry with you 
 Something about just being with you 
 When I leave I feel like I've been with God 
 And that's the way it ought to be, yeah 
 'Cause you've been more then a friend to me 
 You fight off my enemies 
 'Cause you've spoken the truth over my life 
 And you'll never know what it means to me 
 Just to know you've been on your knees for me 
 Oh, you have blessed my life 
 More then you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 More then you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You had faith, when had none 
 You prayed God would bring me a brand new song 
 When I didn't think I could find the strength to sing 
 And all the while I'm hoping that I'll 
 Do the kind of praying for you that you've done for me 
 And that's the way it ought to be 
 'Cause you've been more then a friend to me 
 You fight off my enemies 
 'Cause you've spoken the truth over my life 
 And you'll never know what it means to me 
 Just to know you've been on your knees for me 
 Oh, you have blessed my life 
 More then you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 More then you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You have carried me 
 You have taken upon a burden that wasn't your own 
 And may the blessing return to you 
 A hundred fold, oh yeah, a hundred fold, oh yeah 
 'Cause you've been more then a friend to me 
 You fight off my enemies 
 'Cause you've spoken the truth over my life 
 And you'll never know what it means to me 
 Just to know you've been on your knees for me 
 Oh, you have blessed my life 
 More then you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 More then you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 More than You'll ever know 
 More than You'll ever know 
 More than You'll ever know

I died in Your death my Lord 
 Glory, glory to Your name 
 Buried in the grave with You 
 Glory, glory to Your name 
 And I arose with You my Lord, 
 Glory, glory to Your name! 
 Your blood is my covering 
 My sheltering, where life comes from 
 Your blood is my innocence 
 My righteousness, where I begin 
 Once so far, I am brought near 
 Glory, glory to Your name 
 Raised and seated up with You 
 Glory, glory to Your name 
 And reconciled to God in You 
 Glory, glory to Your name! 
 Death has no victory 
 Sin has no hold on me 
 I'm covered in my Christ who is my life... 
 And I arose with You my Lord 
 Glory, glory to Your name 
 Glory, glory to Your name 
 And Your blood is my covering... 
 Oh Lord, its where I begin 
 Your life, Your love, Your blood falls over me 
 And Your blood is my covering... 
 Your love it falls over me 
 And your blood is my covering...

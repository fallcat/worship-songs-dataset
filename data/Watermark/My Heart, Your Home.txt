Come and make my heart Your home. 
 Come and be everything I am and all I know. 
 Search me through and through till my heart becomes a home for You. 
 A home for You, Lord. 
 A home for You, Lord. 
 Let everything I do open up, 
 A door for You to come through, 
 And that my heart would be a place where You want to be. 
 Come and make my heart Your home. 
 Come and be everything I am and all I know. 
 Search me through and through till my heart becomes a home for You. 
 You are my portion, filling up everything. 
 You are the fortune that's causing my heart to sing. 
 That it's amazing, that You could make Yourself at home with me. 
 Come and make my heart, 
 Come and make it Your home. 
 Come and be everything I am and all I know. 
 Search me through and through till my heart becomes a home for You.

God, so highly and true 
 I am captured by you 
 And all of the things You do 
 Things too wonderful for me 
 Things that set this heart free 
 It's all such a mystery 
 Oh God, sometimes it's like I see It 
 For the first time 
 Oh God, sometimes I realize... 
 That I really have no idea, no idea 
 It feels like coming home every time I'm near You 
 No idea, no idea 
 Yours is a love so true and amazing 
 There's so much of You 
 I really have no idea 
 And when I think about the day 
 When all else will fade away 
 Where are the words to say? 
 Is there a way to describe looking in Your eyes? 
 When I see the mystery, oh God, can't imagine seeing 
 You for the first time 
 Oh God, I know I'll realize that I really had no idea 
 No idea, great is the love that's given me forever 
 No idea, no idea, Your's is a love so true and amazing 
 There's so much of You 
 I really had no idea 
 No idea, no idea 
 You know I can't comprehend You or fully understand 
 But I trust Your heart, You're who You say You are 
 I believe, I believe with all that is in me 
 No idea, no idea 
 It feels like coming home every time I'm near You 
 No idea, no idea 
 Great is the love that's given me forever 
 No idea, no idea 
 Yours is a love so true and amazing 
 I

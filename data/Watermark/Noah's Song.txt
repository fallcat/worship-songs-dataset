Sweet Noah 
 Your eyes are a window 
 To all of our childhood dreams 
 It's almost like we're starting over again 
 One more trip through this life 
 With different eyes to see 
 You're the gift that came to take us back 
 Cause baby dear, you have the joy we lack 
 With your tiny hands 
 You touch a different world 
 Your full of wonder, full of hope 
 And full of one more chance 
 For us to see the world again 
 Like God sees the world 
 Little lover of God 
 You'd smile at a stranger 
 You don't think to be careful 
 How sweet is your love 
 You'd reach for the most unlovely of creatures 
 Your love is so unconditional 
 You're the gift that came to take us back 
 Cause baby dear, you have the love we lack 
 With your tiny heart 
 You'll love a different world 
 Your full of wonder, full of hope 
 And full of one more chance 
 For us to love the world again 
 Like God loves the world 
 And a child shall lead them 
 For such is the kingdom of heaven 
 Simple faith, simple love 
 Just because 
 Little faithful one 
 You're just like a mirror 
 Reflecting anything and everything we do 
 Mirror, mirror oh how you remind us 
 That we should reflect our Father just the same 
 You're the gift that came to take us back 
 Cause baby dear, you have the faith we lack 
 With your tiny life 
 You've shown the precious love of God 
 He's full of mercy, full of grace, 
 And full of one more chance 
 For us to daily learn to love 
 Like He first loved us 
 And a child shall lead them 
 For such is the kingdom of heaven 
 Simple faith, simple love 
 Just because

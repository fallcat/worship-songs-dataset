Come clean the shadows in the closets of my soul 
 You are the Light to come and show 
 All of the empty places and the darkened rooms 
 I cannot hide from what You know 
 'Cause Your truth is the light 
 So come and light me from the inside 
 Open me up 
 And let the healing begin in me 
 I'm giving up everything I am and all that I'll ever be 
 Come pour in all the things 
 You're holding there for me 
 You've been there waiting for me to see 
 All of the things I've placed between Your heart and mine 
 Too much of me I've tried to hide 
 But Your truth is the light 
 So come and light me from the inside 
 What is to come is not yet seen 
 But You have promised everything 
 I know that when I wait for You 
 You make it worth the while 
 From where I am to where You are 
 My seem to be way too far 
 But I call out in the dark 
 Your truth is the light 
 So come and light me from the inside 
 Come clean the shadows in the closets of my soul 
 You are the Light to come and show 
 All of the empty places and the darkened rooms 
 I cannot hide from what You know

Must have been You out in the back yard 
 The mystery was found in the heart of a child 
 I didn't know till now, that even then I knew You 
 And there were songs back then 
 There was a love affair 
 And it goes 'n' and on more than I can remember 
 It goes deeper still more than I could forget 
 But as long as I can remember, I thank You Lord that I 
 Remember you 
 All throughout my life 
 I've been loving you 
 Must have been You on that twilight evening 
 I wore the beaded gown 
 And there were flowers everywhere 
 And it was all so sacred 
 It was holy 
 You are in the simple things of life 
 You know the kind that make me thankful I'm alive 
 Just as You are in the monumental moments 
 That have made us who we are 
 Must have been You who woke me up this morning 
 With sounds familiar now 
 My baby's laughter through the hell 
 And I whispered a prayer as I embraced a new day 
 Because Your strength is perfect 
 It has always been perfect

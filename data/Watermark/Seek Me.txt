Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 Wake up to My sunrise 
 And tell Me all your dreams 
 I will be to listen faithfully 
 I'm the one that sees in you 
 The glory of My Son 
 So for you there is no other now 
 I'm the only one 
 Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 Come now to My table 
 That I've prepared for you 
 You don't have to be ashamed 
 To come into my view 
 And you don't have to be afraid 
 That I will see those wounds 
 Cause my table covers everything 
 It will always cover you 
 Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 La la la la la la la la la la la 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 I will take you as you are 
 You can come into My presence 
 And give all you are 
 Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 Seek Me 
 And when you seek Me you will find Me 
 And when you find Me you will know Me 
 And I will not hold anything from you 
 (Repeat) 
 I will not hold anything from you 
 I will not hold anything from you 
 Seek Me 
 When you seek Me you will find Me 
 Seek Me 
 You can come just as you are 
 You can come just as you are 
 Seek Me

The more I get alone 
 The more I see I need to get alone more, more 
 Cause just when I think that I'm alone 
 Your Spirit calls out to me 
 And even silence has a song 
 Cause that's when You come 
 Sing over me 
 Still, let me be still 
 Let me be okay 
 With the quiet in my heart 
 Still, I want to be still 
 I'm so quick to move 
 Instead of listening to You 
 Shut my mouth 
 Crush my pride 
 Give me the tears 
 Of a broken life 
 Still 
 Of this world, it falls around me 
 And flutters all it's beauty in my eyes 
 But let me choose the solitude 
 Simplicity has always simply changed my life 
 Cause even stillness makes me move 
 Cause that's when my heart 
 Learns to dance with you 
 Still, let me be still 
 Let me be okay 
 With the quiet in my heart 
 Still, I want to be still 
 I'm so quick to move 
 Instead of listening to You 
 I'm your child 
 Tame my heart 
 Obedience 
 To me impart 
 Still 
 La la la la la. hold me 
 La la la la la, cleanse me 
 La la la la la, change me, oh God 
 Change me while I am 
 Still, let me be still 
 And know that you are God 
 And You're always enough 
 Still, I want to be still 
 To take all that I am 
 And simply lift it up 
 Shut my mouth 
 Crush my pride 
 Give me the tears 
 Of a broken life 
 Still... Still... Still... Still...

Take me there to the place 
 Where you are 
 Take me there, take me there 
 I just wanna be where you are 
 Hide me in your shelter 
 Hide me here, hide me here 
 I'd just love to be where you are 
 You have buried my sin 
 In the depths, my Lord 
 And you've covered me 
 From the furious storm 
 And you kept me in 
 The cleft of your rock 
 And You've loved me there 
 Right from the start 
 Chorus/verse/chorus 
 You are here and I can feel you 
 I just love to be where you are 
 Where you are 
 So Hide us in your shelter 
 Hide us here 
 We just love to be where you are 
 We love you Lord

It was in the way You came 
 As a lowly babe 
 That Your glory was displayed 
 And it was in the sacrifice 
 Of the purest life 
 It was in Your Father's will obeyed 
 The perfect Lamb that was slain 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 No other one, no other way for me to see 
 You took my place, You are the way 
 And there's the glory of Your name 
 Yes, there's the glory of Your name 
 It was in Your victory, risen for the world to see 
 That all who would believe could enter in 
 And it is in the passionate price 
 Now demanding all my life 
 And beating in the chambers of my heart 
 And there is nothing in this world 
 That could take the place of You 
 That could take the place of You my Jesus 
 And there is nothing in this life 
 That could take the place of 
 One life, one love 
 One power to save us all 
 One hope, one truth 
 And one glory in it all 
 One glory in it all

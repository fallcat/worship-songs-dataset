Paint me with Your purity 
 That I'd attract Your majesty 
 When others boast in fame and gold 
 The purest place is where I'll go 
 The purest place I will draw near 
 Do what it takes to keep me here 
 In the center of Your heart 
 The purest place is where You are 
 It's not with masses, not with kings 
 Not in these songs or offerings 
 Not in this life or what it brings 
 The purest place is You my King 
 If there's such thing as too beautiful 
 If there's such thing as too wonderful 
 If there's such thing as too marvelous 
 Jesus it's You, Jesus it's You 
 It's You my King, It's You my King 
 The purest place, is You my King...

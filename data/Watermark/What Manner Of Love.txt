Behold what manner of love 
 That we can be called your children. 
 Behold what manner of grace 
 That we can see your face. 
 Unmerited favor resting on me. 
 Unspeakable joy setting me free. 
 Unbelievable circumstance, 
 You gave a second chance to me. 
 Resting on your promise, I carry no shame. 
 Knowing in you, I will never be the same. 
 Just to know you as father 
 Is all that I'll ever really need. 
 Behold what manner of love. 
 Behold what manner of grace.

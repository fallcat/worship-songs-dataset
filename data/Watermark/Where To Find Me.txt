When the lie is deeper than I know 
 You capture me and You carry me home 
 You see these wounds and rescue me 
 You always heal things beautifully 
 And I close my eyes 
 And You can still my heart 
 And I call out Your name... 
 'Cause You always know 
 You always know where to find me... 
 You always know 
 You always know where to find me... 
 And where could I wander that You wouldn't be? 
 Whom have I but You who really knows me? 
 Proven to be the God that sees 
 From strength to strength You've lifted me... 
 And I could cry from the depths of the earth 
 I could stand on a mountaintop 
 And I can speak Your name out to the wind 
 And You go before me... 
 And You fall around me... 
 'Cause You always know 
 You always know where to find me... 
 You always know You always know where to find me...

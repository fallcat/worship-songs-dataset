Over time you've healed so much in me 
 And I am living proof 
 That although my darkest hour had come 
 Your light could still shine through 
 And though at times it's just enough to cast 
 A shadow on the wall 
 Well, I am grateful that you shine your light on me at all 
 Who am I that you would love me so gently? 
 Who am I that you would recognize my name? 
 Lord, who am I that you would speak to me so softly 
 Conversation with the love most high 
 Who am I? 
 Well, amazing grace how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost but now am found 
 Was blind, but now I see 
 And the more I sing that sweet old song the more I understand 
 That I do not comprehend this love that's coming from your hand 
 Who am I that you would love me so gently? 
 Who am I that you would recognize my name? 
 Lord, who am I that you would speak to me so softly 
 Conversation with the love most high 
 Who am I? 
 Grace, grace, God's grace 
 Grace that will pardon and cleanse within 
 Grace, grace, God's grace 
 Grace that is greater than all our sin 
 Who am I that you would love me so gently? 
 Who am I that you would recognize my name? 
 Lord, who am I that you would speak to me so softly 
 Conversation with the love most high 
 Who am I? 
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound 
 Amazing love, now flowing down 
 From hands and feet that were nailed to the tree 
 His grace flows down and covers me. 
 (Repeat) 
 And covers me, and covers me, and covers me, and covers me 
 And covers me, and covers me, and covers me, and covers me 
 (With descant- Grace, grace, God's grace) 
 Who am I that you would love me so gently? 
 Who am I that you would recognize my name? 
 Lord, who am I that you would speak to me so softly 
 Conversation with the love most high 
 Who am I? 
 Lord, who am I, yeah?

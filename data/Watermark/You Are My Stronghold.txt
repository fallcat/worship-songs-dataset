Lord you are my light and my salvation 
 Whom shall I fear if you are near 
 Lord you are my peace when there is war all around me 
 And even here inside me I will have no fear 
 Oh Lord you're my protection from my enemies 
 You set me high upon a rock and You defend my soul 
 And when their ways advance against me 
 I am confident that they cannot make me less, for you have made me whole 
 O Lord, you are my stronghold 
 You are my stronghold 
 Lord you are my strength so let my head be lifted up 
 That I may glory in the ways you've overcome 
 Lord you are my home because you've created in me, 
 A heart that lives the victory that you've already won 
 (x2) 
 Oh Lord you're my protection from my enemies 
 You set me high upon a rock and You defend my soul 
 And when their ways advance against me 
 I am confident that they cannot make me less, for you have made me whole 
 O Lord, you are my stronghold 
 You are my stronghold

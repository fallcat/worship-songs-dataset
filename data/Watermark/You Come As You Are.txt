I lay me down at Your feet my Jesus 
 Find me here with a heart that's pure 
 I am raised up in the love You pour on me 
 The moment I believe... 
 I lay me down at Your feet my Jesus 
 Find me here with a life like Yours 
 I am raised up in pow'r that sets me free 
 The moment I believe 
 The moment I believe 
 You come as You are 
 And I come as I am 
 And grace covers shame 
 You come in Your pow'r 
 And I bow down 
 And grace covers shame 
 You come like a flood and I'm lost in this "Hallelujah!" 
 You come as You are and I come as I am 
 And grace covers all of me... All of me... 
 I lay me down at Your feet my Master 
 Find me here with the grace to know 
 That I am raised up in the perfect love of God 
 The moment I believe 
 The moment I believe 
 I am laid broken 
 Lord I am open 
 Breathe in me 
 And this by design 
 Is Your life divine 
 Living in me... 
 You come as You are... 
 I come as I am 
 You come in Your power 
 And I bow down

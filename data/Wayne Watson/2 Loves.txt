Real love, true love to last for a lifetime 
 I fell head over heels for her 
 Tell me, do ya think we could grow old together 
 Broken, she said that she loved another, oh... 
 Heartache, feeling despised and rejected, ooh... 
 Jesus, I heard you felt it, too 
 Perfect, she said her first love was higher 
 Tell me, Jesus, her perfect love, is it You? 
 Oh, if Jesus takes over the heart of your love 
 When it comes to the needs of a man 
 If she's given her first love away 
 She can love you like nobody can 
 Like nobody can, oh-oh-oh... 
 Morning, first risen, night, last one sleeping 
 Treasured higher than finest gold 
 Serving as unto God's higher calling 
 Ooh, she's got beauty reachin' deep to the heart and the soul 
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh... 
 Well, if Jesus takes over the heart of your love 
 When it comes to the needs of a man 
 If she's given her first love away 
 She can love you like nobody can 
 Like nobody can, oh-oh-oh... 
 If Jesus takes over the heart of your love 
 When it comes to the needs of a man 
 If she's given her first love away 
 Ooh, she can love you like nobody can 
 Like nobody can 
 Ooh, yeah...

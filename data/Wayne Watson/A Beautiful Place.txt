If I had my way, I must admit 
 If I called every play of the game 
 I'd pray for good times, blue sky and sunshine 
 And avoid with a passion the pain 
 But with every blow from an angry wind 
 And with every dark shadow that falls 
 There's a better view up around the bend 
 Where this puzzle makes some sense after all 
 Mistakes and misfortunes will come and go 
 But to try and to fail is no disgrace 
 Sometimes a rough and a rocky road 
 Can take you to a beautiful place 
 Is there anyone looking back in faith 
 That can deny that the Father knows best 
 Oh, but at the time and place for the life of you 
 You saw no reason, no good for the test 
 But now remembering as you watched His hand 
 Put the color to your black and white dreams 
 Maybe one more time past what you can see 
 The trouble of the moment's not as bad as it seems 
 Mistakes and misfortunes will come and go 
 But to try and to fail is no disgrace, no, no 
 Sometimes a rough and a rocky road 
 Is gonna take you to a beautiful place 
 And the unspoiled beauty of the wisdom of God 
 Lies in the wilderness, yeah 
 Up there beyond the easy reach 
 Where the journey takes a little more faith, I guess 
 I guess, I guess 
 A little more faith, I guess 
 (Sometimes a rough and a rocky road) 
 Sometimes, sometimes 
 Mistakes and misfortunes will come and go 
 But to try and to fail, it's no disgrace, no, no 
 Sometimes a rough and a rocky road 
 It can take you to a beautiful 
 Beautiful, beautiful place, oh 
 Oh, it can take you to a beautiful place 
 I know, I know, I know 
 Gonna take you there 
 I'm gonna take you there 
 Sometimes, sometimes 
 Rough and rocky road 
 Gonna take you, gonna take you 
 To a beautiful place, yeah 
 To a beautiful place, yeah, yeah 
 To a beautiful place

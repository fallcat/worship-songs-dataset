One little stranger 
 One in a million 
 One homeless angel 
 One helpless child 
 In the fields that God has sown 
 Blessings live, life is grown 
 And empty space, the Father knew 
 There is a place for you 
 So come cross the ocean 
 Safe to the harbor 
 Into a family 
 Two worlds away 
 Far from your tragedy 
 Safe and secure 
 All along, the Father knew 
 There is a place for you 
 Oh, there is a place for you 
 Every child in God's family 
 Souls orphaned at birth 
 Knows a hunger, a thirst to be wanted 
 But every son, every daughter 
 Whether pauper or king 
 Can celebrate heaven's welcoming arms 
 Stand with me, children 
 Come out from the shadows 
 Room for so many 
 His promise is true 
 It's a common ground, every soul 
 Wants to live and be loved 
 And in the sight of heaven's view 
 There is a place for you 
 It's a common ground, every soul 
 Wants to live and be loved 
 And in the sight of heaven's view 
 There is a place for you 
 In the sight of heaven's view 
 There is a place for you 
 Oh, there is a place for you

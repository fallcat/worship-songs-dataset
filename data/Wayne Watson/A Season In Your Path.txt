Heard that friends are friends forever 
 But we don't talk much anymore 
 I guess that I've gone my way 
 And I guess that you've gone yours 
 Was kindness too neglected 
 On my list of deep regret 
 In spite of distance unexpected 
 Can we forgive but not forget 
 Sometimes I think about you 
 Some old memories make me cry 
 Remembering the good times make me laugh 
 Yeah, yeah 
 But all in all, I'm richer 
 For the happy and the sad 
 And thankful for a season in your path 
 I guess God alone deciphers 
 When people need each other most 
 Who will be the blessed receiver 
 And who will be the gracious host 
 And all a servant here can do 
 Is unto the Lord avail 
 Content at times to be the wind 
 And at times to be the sail 
 If another winter settles 
 On your shoulder down the road 
 Without a thought of what's behind us 
 Let me help you pull your load 
 Sometimes I think about you 
 Some old memories make me cry 
 But remembering the good times make me laugh 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh, but all in all, I'm richer 
 For the happy and the sad 
 And thankful for a season in your path 
 Oh, yeah, thankful for a season in your path 
 Oh-oh...

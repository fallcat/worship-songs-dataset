Almighty, most Holy God 
 Faithful through the ages 
 Almighty, most Holy Lord 
 Glorious, Almighty God 
 The beasts of the field, the birds of the air 
 Are silent to call out Your Name 
 The earth has no voice and I have no choice 
 But to magnify God unashamed 
 Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day 
 Let the whole world sing out, let the people say 
 Almighty, most Holy God 
 Faithful through the ages 
 Almighty, most Holy Lord 
 Glorious, Almighty God 
 Well, time marches on, with the innocence gone 
 And a darkness has covered the earth 
 But His Spirit still dwells, He speaks, "it is well" 
 And the hopeless still offered new birth 
 He will break the leash of death, it will have no sting 
 Let the prisoner go free, join the dance and sing 
 Almighty, most Holy God 
 Faithful through the ages 
 Almighty, most Holy Lord 
 Glorious, Almighty 
 Almighty, most Holy God 
 Faithful through the ages 
 (Faithful, faithful) 
 Almighty, most Holy Lord 
 Glorious, Almighty God 
 Almighty God, Almighty God 
 You are faithful 
 Almighty God 
 Almighty God, Almighty God 
 You are faithful through the ages 
 Almighty God, oh... 
 Almighty God 
 You are faithful, faithful 
 Almighty, most Holy Lord 
 Glorious, Almighty God 
 You are faithful 
 You are faithful, faithful

 Glorious, Almighty God

 Oh, You are faithful through the ages 
 Oh, most Holy Lord 
 Glorious, glorious

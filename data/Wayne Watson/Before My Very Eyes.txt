I haven't seen it all, but I've seen enough 
 Got some memories, some I pray, one day, I'll forget 
 You wipe the vision clear and here it comes again 
 Try to hide your eyes 'cause you realize it's sin 
 Charmers from the left and right 
 They fight for my attention 
 "Hey-hey, mister, look over here" 
 I've declared my stand, no 
 I will set no evil thing 
 Before my eyes 
 Only good, only truth 
 Blind to all the lies 
 I know I could waiver, Lord 
 Sometimes I regress 
 So keep the light of holiness 
 Before my very eyes 
 Before my very eyes 
 Before my very eyes 
 On the city street, writing on the walls 
 From the TV screen screamin' thoughts obscene 
 It's everywhere 
 But I can rise above and not be overcome 
 Not by this foolishness, I can win this race I run 
 Charmers from the left and right 
 They fight for my attention 
 "Hey-hey, mister, look over here" 
 I'm gonna take my stand, no, no 
 I know... 
 I will set no evil thing 
 Before my eyes 
 Only good, only truth 
 Blind to all the lies 
 I know I could waiver, Lord 
 Sometimes I regress 
 So keep the light of holiness 
 Before my... 
 I will set no evil thing 
 Before my eyes 
 Only good, only truth 
 Blind to all the lies 
 I know I could waiver, Lord 
 Sometimes I regress 
 So keep the light of holiness 
 Before my very eyes 
 Before my very eyes 
 Keep the light 
 Before my very eyes 
 Gonna rise above 
 Keep the light 
 Before my very eyes 
 I'm gonna take my stand 
 Gonna rise above 
 Keep the light of holiness 
 Keep me in the light, oh... 
 Take my stand 
 Keep the light of holiness 
 Before my very eyes 
 Before my very eyes 
 Before my very eyes

Blessed are the poor in spirit 
 God has faithfully revealed 
 That the riches of the kingdom 
 With their souls in Christ are sealed 
 Blessed are the grieved, the weeping 
 Those whose tears for others cry 
 Selfless, giving, bearing sorrow 
 Will be dancing by and by 
 Those who hunger and are thirsty 
 Craving righteousness and life 
 Won't be filled by any other 
 Satisfied by none by Christ 
 Blessed are the meek and gentle 
 No demands, no claims to rights 
 In their patience, strong and mighty 
 Confidence and faith in Christ 
 And to those of tender mercy 
 From them falls as gentle rain 
 Grace and Kindness, sweet compassion 
 Mercy given and mercy gained 
 Blessed are the true peacemakers 
 With contentment for the fold 
 They cling to promises of heaven 
 Working in the field of souls 
 Blessed are...

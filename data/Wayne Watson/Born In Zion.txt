Very few are born to riches, very few 
 Very few of cherished wishes ever come true 
 But that won't matter much at all 
 On the day your name is called 
 When this earthbound life is through 
 And your Father says of you 
 This one was born in Zion 
 Make no mistake, this one is Mine 
 This one was born in Zion 
 This one will never, this one will never 
 This one will never die 
 Very few are ever famous, very few 
 Very few will ever live the dream that they choose 
 But that won't matter much at all 
 On the day your name is called 
 When this earthbound life is through 
 And your Father says of you 
 This one was born in Zion 
 Make no mistake, this one is Mine 
 This one was born in Zion 
 This one will never, this one will never 
 This one will never die 
 And every dream left unfulfilled 
 And every worthy goal 
 Is just a shadow of the joy that waits 
 Forever to unfold 
 This one was born in Zion 
 Make no mistake, this one is Mine 
 This one was born in Zion 
 This one will never, oh, this one will never 
 This one will never die

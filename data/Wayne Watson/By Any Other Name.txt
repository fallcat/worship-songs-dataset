At the Name, all heaven fell at His feet 
 At the Name, the saving of the world was done 
 On the lips of everyone 
 Wanting God's complete forgiveness 
 Every soul in desperation 
 Every body in pain 
 Every broken heart can call on the Name 
 His Name is Jesus 
 And I am not ashamed 
 To call on Jesus 
 Heaven's door will not be opened 
 By any other Name 
 And to the Name, the world has grown so cold 
 Oh, as if eternal life could 
 Just be bought and sold, oh 
 As if the precious blood of Christ 
 Was spilled for no go reason 
 But every knee will bow one day 
 And every tongue will proclaim 
 That the Perfect Son of Heaven 
 Is the Name above all names 
 His Name is Jesus 
 And I am not ashamed 
 To call on Jesus 
 Heaven's door will not be opened 
 By any other Name 
 And here on earth 
 Some call it out in vile profanity 
 And take the Name of Christ in vain 
 Oh, life in the world has robbed 
 Some innocence away from me 
 But through it all, I know He loves me 
 I will glorify the Name 
 His Name is Jesus 
 And I am not ashamed 
 To call on Jesus 
 To call on Jesus 
 His Name is Jesus 
 And I am not ashamed 
 To call on Jesus 
 Heaven's door will not be opened 
 By any other Name 
 By any other Name

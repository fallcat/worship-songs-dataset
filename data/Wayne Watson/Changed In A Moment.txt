Changed in a moment 
 In the twinkling of an eye 
 Take a look into Glory 
 Seated at the feet of God the Father 
 Singing with the Angels, Alleluia! 
 Any moment now you could be changed 
 I have heard it for some time now 
 This life will soon be done 
 That our striving will be over 
 And the war will soon be won 
 That the Lord Himself will call us 
 That the trumpet blast will sound 
 And the graves will all be opened 
 And Holy feet will leave the ground 
 Changed in a moment 
 In the twinkling of an eye 
 Take a look into Glory 
 Seated at the feet of God the Father 
 Singing with the Angels, Alleluia! 
 Any moment now you could be changed 
 Oh, I remember praying 
 In the happy days of youth 
 For the world to keep on turning 
 There was so much left to do 
 There were battlefields to conquer 
 There were mountains left to climb 
 And dreams to be realized 
 But now I've changed my mind 
 Some of the goals that seemed unreachable 
 Are finally in my grasp 
 Some of the dreams most unbelievable 
 Have come to be at last 
 And although I've had a better life 
 Than I ever thought could be 
 There is a better day a-coming 
 When He comes back for you and me 
 Changed in a moment 
 In the twinkling of an eye 
 Take a look into Glory 
 Seated at the feet of God the Father 
 Singing with the Angels, Alleluia! 
 Any moment now, any moment now 
 Any moment now we could be changed 
 Any moment now we could be changed 
 Any moment now we could be changed 
 Any moment now we could be changed 
 Any moment now we could be changed

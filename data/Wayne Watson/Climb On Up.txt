I guess you can stay down in that pit if you want to 
 But I'm ready to start crawlin' out of mine 
 I know it's easy to get comfortable here 
 Seems like everybody's gotta do a little time 
 But one of these day's you're gonna lift up your head 
 Stop your daily conversations with your pain 
 No more long lunches with that pitiful you 
 You're gonna set your eyes on Jesus again 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 You can do it, yes you can 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 Higher ground, promised land 
 I know with a word He could make everything right 
 He could wipe all the clouds from the sky 
 He could hold out His hand and bring peace to the sea 
 He could even dry every tear from your eyes 
 But you know these arms go weak 
 If they don't push and pull and struggle 
 With the body, with the mind, and the soul 
 Maybe God's plan to get this rock off my back 
 Is to help me pull some brother, some brother from the hole 
 And tell him to 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 You can do it, yes you can 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 Higher ground, promised land 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 You can do it, yes you can 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 Higher ground, promised land 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 You can do it, yes you can 
 Come on, climb on up here with me 
 Higher ground, promised land

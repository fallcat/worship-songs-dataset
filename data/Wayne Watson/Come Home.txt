I looked out across the field 
 At the sundown gold 
 Don't feel so young anymore 
 But sure don't feel old 
 And I remember you as a child 
 Running 'round free 
 You would play through the day into nighttime 
 Till you could not see 
 Come home, come home 
 Night is falling but the lights are on 
 Come home, come home 
 Night is falling and it won't be long 
 'Til I, I turn my head 
 And you'll be grown 
 I stood in the dark, by the window 
 Lookin' for your lights 
 I sleep better knowing everybody's home 
 And everybody's alright 
 Yeah, just one of those things that happens 
 When you care so much 
 And you pray to keep from worryin' 
 Then you worry you ain't prayin' enough 
 Come home, come home 
 Night is falling but the lights are on 
 Come home, oh, come home 
 Night is falling and it won't be long 
 'Til I, I turn my head 
 And look around and you'll be grown 
 I know we are all just children 
 Even your momma and me 
 And everybody gone before us 
 From this family 
 Oh, but God, the good, good Father watches 
 Those He calls His own 
 And one day when we're through growin' 
 He's gonna call us home 
 (And He'll say) 
 Come home, come home 
 Night is falling but the lights goes on 
 Come home, come home 
 Night had fallin' and it's been so long 
 Since we've all been together 
 Gonna be here forever 
 Come home, come on home

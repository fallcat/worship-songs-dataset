I want to serve You with my whole heart 
 Feed the passion with You love 
 You have promised me that You'll be faithful 
 That should be enough that is enough 
 You have trusted me with this message 
 For the nations of the world 
 Set a fire in me and keep it burning 
 So the people know, till everyone has heard 
 It's the cry of my heart to follow You 
 It's the cry of my heart 
 I feel it deep in my soul 
 I want to lose control 
 It's the cry of my heart to follow You 
 Not a heart that runs away from trial 
 But a spirit full of power 
 I have waited long enough in my life 
 I know this is the day 
 I know this is the hour 
 It's the cry of my heart to follow You 
 It's the cry of my heart 
 I feel it deep in my soul 
 I want to lose control 
 It's the cry of my heart to follow You 
 Blind these eyes to everything that pulls me away 
 Purify my deepest desire here and today 
 It's the cry of my heart to follow You 
 It's the cry of my heart 
 I feel it deep in my soul 
 I want to lose control 
 It's the cry of my heart to follow You

You've got my file right in front of You 
 That's it, that's right, that's me 
 My bag of sorrows and my sack of blues 
 Every doubt, my unbelief 
 Oh, see, I've got page after page 
 After pitiful page, a list that never ends 
 Feel the need to bring up these old bones again 
 Don't You remember all the times I failed You 
 All the times I wandered away 
 And don't You remember all of my offenses 
 Walking with the fools on parade? 
 I know You'd really like to help me out 
 But You don't even know what I'm talking about 
 It's not so much that You don't remember 
 It's more that You choose to forget 
 How does it work that omniscient God 
 Can wipe the slate so clean 
 That if you looked for a single spot 
 A single spot could not be seen? 
 Oh, still I've got page after page after 
 Pitiful page locked in my memory 
 Then I heard Him when He said to me: 
 Don't you remember I promised to forgive ya? 
 Gone as far as east from the west 
 And don't you remember I promised to be faithful 
 Wash away the sin you confess? Oh, yeah 
 You know I'd really like to help you out 
 But I don't even know what you're talking about 
 It's not so much that I don't remember 
 But it's more that I choose to forget, ah, yeah 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 Don't you remember I promised to forgive ya? 
 Gone as far as east from the west 
 And don't you remember I promised to be faithful 
 Wash away the sin you confess? Oh, yeah 
 You know I'd really like to help you out 
 But I don't even know what you're talking about 
 It's not so much that I don't remember 
 But it's more that I choose to forget 
 Don't you remember I promised to forgive ya? 
 Gone as far as east from the west 
 And don't you remember I promised to be faithful 
 Wash away the sin you confess? Oh, yeah 
 You know I'd really like to help you out 
 But I don't even know what you're talking about 
 It's not so much that I don't remember 
 But it's more that I choose to forget

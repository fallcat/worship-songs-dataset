What is past is past 
 What is done is over 
 I will not go back and relive what's best forgotten 
 I can't say why 
 Why healing is so painful 
 Why is takes so long for old memories to fade 
 I'm dreaming again, believe again 
 That God will use me is the prayer of my heart 
 I'm here for the taking, this is only the start 
 I'm dreaming again 
 Battle lines are drawn 
 I'm learning to know the enemy 
 But You restore my soul for the work that You began in me 
 Let me live this day 
 As if there's no tomorrow 
 But at the very same 
 I want to dream as if this world will never end 
 I'm dreaming again, believe again 
 That God will use me is the prayer of my heart 
 I'm here for the taking, this is only the start 
 I'm dreaming again 
 Why is it easier to believe all the lies 
 Than to trust God with things I don't understand? 
 It is just a simple faith I need 
 I will, I will, because He can 
 I'm dreaming again, believe again 
 That God will use me is the prayer of my heart 
 I'm here for the taking, this is only the start 
 I'm dreaming again

It's good to be lonely every now and again 
 To be parted from the ones you adore 
 To sit at a table for two all alone 
 And take a look at the world around you 
 At people with no one to go home to 
 And some with a place to belong 
 Others consumed by their weakness 
 And another when weak seems so strong 
 Lord, let me be at peace wherever I am 
 Satisfied with all I have, a faithful friend 
 And know I am grateful 
 'Cause if it makes me love you even more 
 I know I'm sure 
 It's good to be lonely every now and again 
 It's good to go down to defeat now and then 
 To fail at some nobel pursuit 
 To fall short of the prize and find in His eyes 
 There's nothing your victory can do, no 
 To secure higher favor 
 Oh, He cannot love you more than now 
 Winners and losers 
 All are the same somehow, somehow 
 Lord, let me be at peace wherever I am 
 Satisfied with all I have, a faithful friend 
 And know I am grateful 
 'Cause if it makes me love you even more 
 I know I'm sure 
 It's good to go down to defeat now and again 
 And it's good to know sorrow 
 To be closely acquainted with grief 
 To be showered with tears 
 No reason to cheer 
 To find in Christ your only relief 
 Oh, Lord, let me be at peace wherever I am 
 Satisfied with all I have, a faithful friend 
 And know I am grateful 
 'Cause if it makes me love you a little bit more 
 I know I'm sure 
 It's good to know sorrow every now and again 
 It's good to know sorrow every now and again 
 (Every now and again) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 (Every now and again) 
 Every now and again 
 Starting to think about it 
 Every now and again 
 (Yeah, yeah...)

The first thought every morning 
 I have without fail is a thought of You 
 And through the rush of the day 
 My ideal is to ask, "what would Jesus do?" 
 When to speak, when to hear 
 When to look and when to close my eyes 
 But sometimes the strength of my will 
 Pulls me down to a weakness I despise 
 Not every once in a while 
 Not just from time to time 
 Not every now and then 
 Driven by motion 
 It is a dream I have 
 It is a prayer I pray 
 To sleep in peace 
 At the end of the day 
 Having done my best to obey 
 Every waking moment 
 (Every waking moment) 
 (Every waking moment) 
 Still, the noble efforts I make aren't enough 
 To secure me a heavenly place 
 And my attempts at perfection are weak 
 I am lost, but for Your grace 
 Ah, the only strength that I have 
 Is when I fall on my knees, and for mercy cry 
 And offer You my heart, my soul 
 My breath, my very life 
 Not every once in a while 
 Not just from time to time 
 Oh, not every now and then 
 Only driven by motion 
 It is a dream I have 
 It is a prayer I pray 
 To sleep in peace 
 At the end of the day 
 Having done my best to obey 
 Every waking moment 
 Oh, not every once in a while 
 Not just from time to time 
 Oh, not every now and then 
 Only driven by motion 
 It is a dream I have 
 It is a prayer I pray 
 To sleep in peace 
 At the end of the day 
 Having done my best to obey 
 Every waking moment 
 Every waking moment 
 I will do my best to obey 
 Every waking moment

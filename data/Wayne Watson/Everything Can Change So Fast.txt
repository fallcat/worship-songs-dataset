You've got the world on a string 
 Everything you ever wanted and more 
 Yeah, the top of the heap feels so sweet 
 When the world beats a path to your door 
 People tell you to be careful 
 What will you do when the good times come to an end 
 You may have heard this a million times before 
 But I think you need to hear it again, my friend 
 I tell you... 
 Everything can change so fast 
 Oh, everything can change so fast 
 In the blink of an eye 
 Oh, the thrill could be past 
 Everything can change so fast 
 (Everything can change) 
 So you're lost and alone 
 With no hope for your soul when the party's through 
 Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven forever 
 But not you, no, not you 
 Jesus said it just takes a simple faith 
 To wash a lifetime of guilt and sin away 
 And a heart that is weeping will be dancing for joy 
 Yeah, the minute you trust Him, the minute you pray 
 I tell you... 
 Everything can change so fast 
 Oh, everything can change so fast 
 In the blink of an eye 
 Your sin's a thing of the past 
 Everything can change so fast 
 All the ups and downs 
 And the round and round 
 And round won't hurt me 
 For better or worse 
 The wind will blow 
 But You won't desert me 
 I know You won't desert me, no 
 I tell you 
 Everything can change so fast 
 Oh, everything can change so fast 
 Everything can change 
 In the blink of an eye 
 Oh, your sin's a thing of the past 
 Everything can change so fast 
 (Everything can change) 
 Everything can change 
 (Everything can change) 
 Everything can change so fast 
 (Everything can change) 
 Everything can change 
 All the ups and downs 
 And the round and round 
 And round and round 
 Everything can change 
 You know, everything can change

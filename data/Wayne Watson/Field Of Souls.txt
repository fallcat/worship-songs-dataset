We work the field of souls 
 Together you and I 
 Some fields are blooming now 
 And other fields are dry 
 We are not the same 
 But differences aside 
 We will work the field of souls 
 Together, you and I 
 One is off to foreign soil 
 To work a distant land 
 And another anchors close to home 
 To hold a neighbor's hand 
 Tell me, who has served the Father most 
 And who has labored best 
 Oh, that life devoted to our God 
 That devotion will be blessed 
 We work the field of souls 
 Together you and I 
 Some fields are blooming now 
 Other fields are dry 
 We are not the same 
 Oh, but differences aside 
 We will work the field of souls 
 Oh, together, you and I 
 One shouts the gospel in the streets 
 For everyone to hear 
 He is bold to everyone he meets 
 And the Word is loud and clear 
 Oh, and another cries alone and prays 
 In silence on her knees 
 Before the throne day after day 
 Where human eyes don't see 
 We work the field of souls 
 Together you and I 
 Some fields are blooming now 
 Oh, and other fields are dry 
 We are not the same 
 Oh, but differences aside 
 I know we will work the field of souls 
 Together, you and I 
 Oh, together, together 
 Ooh, we work the field of souls 
 Together you and I 
 Some fields are blooming now 
 Oh, and other fields are dry 
 We are not the same 
 Oh, but differences aside 
 I know we will work the field of souls 
 Together, you and I 
 Yeah, we will work the field of souls 
 Together you and I 
 We will work the field of souls 
 We will work together, you and I 
 Together, you and I 
 Together 
 We will work the field of souls 
 Together 
 (We will work the field) 
 (We will work of souls...)

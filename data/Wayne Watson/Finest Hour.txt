What a moment this is 
 It is good to be alive 
 There is still time for changing the world 
 I believe it can happen 
 God has given us life, yeah 
 He has given us breath 
 And the sun is not set 
 We are not finished yet 
 And I tell you, there must be a reason 
 This could be your finest hour 
 This could be your greatest day 
 This could be your finest hour 
 Don't throw it away 
 'Cause you just never know 
 You never know what's around the next bend 
 There are answers to prayer 
 So you just can't stop caring 
 This is not the end 
 It's not only the young 
 No, not just the fast or the strong 
 But to the one who is wise 
 Who will open their eyes 
 To the spirit of God 
 To His power, oh... 
 This could be your finest hour 
 This could be your greatest day 
 This could be your finest hour 
 Don't throw it away, oh... 
 This could be your finest hour 
 Oh, this could be your place in time 
 This could be your defining moment 
 Get ready to shine, get ready to shine 
 Get ready 
 Oh, this could be your finest hour 
 Yeah, this could be your greatest day 
 Yeah, this could be your finest hour 
 Don't you throw it away, yeah 
 This could be your finest hour 
 Oh, this could be your place in time 
 Yeah, this could be your defining moment 
 Get ready to shine 
 Yeah, are you ready to shine? 
 (Are you ready to shine?) 
 Are you ready to... 
 Are you ready to shine? 
 (This could be your finest hour) 
 Are you ready? 
 (Shine) 
 Are you ready to shine?

Now, all I have is now 
 To be faithful, to be holy 
 And to shine lighting up the darkness 
 Right now, I really have no choice 
 But to voice the truth to the nations 
 A generation looking for God 
 For such a time as this 
 I was placed upon the earth 
 To hear the voice of God 
 And do His will, whatever it is 
 For such a time as this 
 For now and all the days He gives 
 I am here, I am here 
 And I am His 
 For such a time as this 
 You, do you ever wonder why 
 Seems like the grass is always greener 
 Under everybody else's sky 
 But right here, right here for this time and place 
 You can live a mirror of His mercy 
 A forgiven image of grace 
 For such a time as this 
 I was placed upon the earth 
 To hear the voice of God 
 And do His will, whatever it is 
 For such a time as this 
 For now and all the days He gives 
 I am here, I am here 
 And I am His 
 For such a time as this 
 Can't change what's happened till now 
 But we can change what will be 
 By living in holiness 
 That the world will see Jesus 
 For such a time as this 
 I was placed upon the earth 
 To hear the voice of God 
 And do His will, whatever it is 
 For such a time as this 
 For now and all the days He gives 
 I am here, I am here 
 And I am His 
 For such a time 
 For such a time as this 
 I was placed upon the earth 
 Oh, to hear the voice of God 
 And do His will, whatever it is 
 For such a time as this 
 For now and all the days He gives 
 I am here, I am here 
 And I am His 
 For such a time as this

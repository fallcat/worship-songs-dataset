Coming to you live by satellite 
 From a secret side of town 
 No mistaking, bonds are shaking 
 Walls are breaking down 
 You can walk across the border tonight 
 Unafraid to cross that line 
 Breathe the fresh air, kiss the free ground 
 Leave your dark shadows behind 
 What will you do with your new liberation 
 Open your heart to the God of Creation 
 Freedom 
 People cry for freedom 
 Freedom without Jesus 
 Is just another wall 
 Freedom 
 Give the people freedom 
 Give the people Jesus 
 Or they've got nothing at all 
 Wise and foolish men alike 
 Visualizing peace 
 And it's coming to pass, freedom at last 
 It's coming into reach 
 So don't be fooled by a fool's reward 
 Hold out for higher ground 
 'Cause when the time comes, battles are won 
 Nothing's gonna hold me down 
 So don't you mourn and say how you'll miss me 
 When you hear the horn, come and go with me 
 Freedom 
 People cry for freedom 
 Freedom without Jesus 
 Is just another wall 
 Oh-oh, freedom 
 Give the people freedom 
 But give the people Jesus 
 Or they've got nothing at all, no, no 
 Freedom 
 People cry for freedom 
 Freedom without Jesus 
 Is just another wall, yeah, yeah 
 Freedom 
 Oh, give the people freedom 
 Give the people Jesus 
 Or they've got nothing at all 
 They got nothing, no 
 Freedom 
 People cry for freedom 
 Freedom without Jesus 
 Oh, is just another wall, yeah, yeah 
 Freedom 
 Give the people freedom 
 Oh, and give the people Jesus 
 Or they've got nothing at all, no, no, no

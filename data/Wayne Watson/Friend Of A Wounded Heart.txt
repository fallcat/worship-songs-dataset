Smile, make them think you're happy 
 Lie, and say that things are fine 
 And hide that empty longing that you feel 
 Don't ever show it, just keep your heart concealed 
 Why are the days so lonely? 
 I wonder where, where can a heart go free? 
 And who will dry the tears that no one sees? 
 There must be someone to share your silent dreams 
 Caught like a leaf in the wind 
 Looking for a friend, where can you turn? 
 Whisper the words of a prayer 
 And you'll find Him there 
 Arms open wide, love in His eyes 
 Jesus, He meets you where you are 
 Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, He heals your secret scars 
 All the love you're longing for is Jesus 
 The friend of a wounded heart 
 Joy, comes like the the morning 
 And hope, deepens as you grow 
 And peace, beyond the reaches of your soul 
 Comes blowing through you, for love has made you whole 
 Once like a leaf in the wind 
 Looking for a friend, where could you turn? 
 Oh, you spoke the words of a prayer 
 And you found Him there 
 Arms open wide, love in His eyes 
 Jesus, He meets you where you are 
 Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, He heals your secret scars 
 All the love you're longing for is Jesus 
 The friend of a wounded heart 
 He meets you where you are 
 Oh-oh-oh, Jesus, He heals your secret scars 
 All the love you're longing for 
 All the love that you need, oh, is Jesus 
 The friend of a wounded heart 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 A friend of a wounded heart 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 A friend of a wounded heart...

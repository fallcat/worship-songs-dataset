They're not hiding anymore 
 They're not ashamed anymore 
 Evil deeds done in secret 
 They're celebrating sin on the street 
 Consume the innocent like lions 
 That never get enough to eat 
 There are giants in the land 
 Giants in the land 
 Giants in the land 
 I hear them scoff at Jesus' Name 
 A pagan planet is there aim 
 They deny a Higher Power 
 Deny the final hour is at hand 
 But their fortresses will crumble 
 Like castles washed away from the sand 
 There are giants in the land, oh-oh 
 Giants in the land, oh-oh 
 Giants in the land 
 But within our reach there is a victor's sword 
 A mighty, sovereign Lord 
 The Rock of Ages, waiting to be hurled 
 At the giants of the world 
 When they challenge men of peace 
 Then with the shout of victory 
 We will bring them to there knees, yeah 
 We're not hiding anymore 
 No, we're not silent anymore 
 We may be feeble in their eyes 
 But our power's not our size or our fame 
 We must follow His command 
 To claim to world in Jesus' Name 
 Just remember 
 There are giants in the land, oh-oh 
 Giants in the land, oh-oh 
 There are giants in the land, oh-oh 
 There are giants in the land 
 Giants in the land 
 I know that there are giants in the land 
 Oh, just remember 
 There are giants in the land 
 Oh, I can see 'em 
 Giants in the land 
 I know, I know that there are 
 Giants in the land 
 Giants in the land

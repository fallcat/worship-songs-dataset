Lord, God, when I consider the heavens 
 And the work of Your hand, what is man 
 That You are mindful of him 
 Lord God, when I consider the moon and the stars 
 And the worlds You ordained, who can say 
 Why You are mindful of him 
 You put all things under his feet 
 And give him rule over Your creation 
 Almighty God, how majestic is Your name 
 Every knee will bow and every tongue will praise and 
 Glorify, glorify Your name 
 We will glorify, glorify Your name 
 And together the redeemed, all forgiven will proclaim 
 We will glorify, glorify Your name 
 Oh Lord God, when I consider Your blessing 
 And the gift of Your grace, I stand amazed 
 Your merciful eyes fall on me 
 Oh Lord God, You forgave my transgressions 
 And You restore my soul, white as snow 
 Lighting the darkness in me 
 In the shadows of the valley 
 I will not fear, You are beside me 
 Almighty God, how majestic is Your name 
 Every knee will bow and every tongue will praise and 
 Glorify, glorify Your name 
 We will glorify, glorify Your name 
 And together the redeemed, all forgiven will proclaim 
 We will glorify, glorify Your name

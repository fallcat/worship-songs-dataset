Down on the corner 
 They've got it all figured out 
 Little room for mystery 
 Little room for doubt 
 Got no time for questions 
 Everything is black and white 
 That's right 
 A little further down the highway 
 They're studyin' the word 
 If you ain't heard out version 
 Brother, you ain't really heard 
 It's our darlin' revelation 
 Everything is crystal clear 
 Cool and collected 
 Nothing left to learn, nearly perfected 
 Lord, have mercy on our arrogant souls 
 Before we were us 
 It was You alone, I know 
 God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in, oh, no 
 He won't be contained 
 By some shiny, wrapped-up view of Him 
 God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in 
 Lord, we know everything You're up to 
 Know just what to expect 
 Who You're gonna nail 
 And who You're gonna protect 
 So come on, line 'em up, sign 'em up 
 All our little ducks in a row 
 So, come on, tell me 
 Who's got all the answers 
 God is not puppet on a string, no, no 
 He ain't no carnival prancer 
 Come on, open up the doors 
 For the strong and mighty King 
 Whoa, God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in, whoa, no 
 He won't be contained 
 By some shiny, wrapped-up view of Him 
 God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in, whoa! 
 So, come on, tell me 
 Who's got all the answers 
 God is not puppet on a string, no, sir 
 He ain't no carnival prancer 
 Come on, open wide your doors 
 For the strong and mighty King 
 God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in 
 Whoa, no, no, no 
 God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in 
 Whoa, no, no, no 
 God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in 
 He ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in 
 He won't be contained, no 
 He won't be contained 
 By some shiny, wrapped-up view of Him 
 Whoa, God ain't gonna stay 
 In the little box I put Him in

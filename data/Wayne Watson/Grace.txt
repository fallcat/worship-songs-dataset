Grace keeps giving me things I don't deserve 
 Mercy keeps withholding things I do 
 Words that seldom fail me 
 Leave me looking for the words 
 To express my gratitude 
 This list keeps getting longer 
 More than I can count 
 I thought I could get close to more deserving 
 Unworthy on my best day 
 Unworthy at my worst 
 To receive this blessing that You give me freely 
 Grace keeps giving me things I don't deserve 
 Mercy keeps withholding this I do 
 Words that seldom fail me 
 Leave me looking for the words 
 To express my gratitude 
 You must have Your reason 
 You must have a plan 
 You must see some treasure here I'm missing 
 If I could see myself through Your eyes 
 It would be easier to breathe 
 And display Your loving-kindness to the world around me 
 Grace keeps giving me things I don't deserve 
 Mercy keeps withholding this I do 
 Words that seldom fail me 
 Leave me looking for the words 
 To express my gratitude 
 For grace...

I'm growing, I don't like it 
 I'm growing and it hurts 
 I love You, but I'm tired 
 I guess I've got a lot to learn 
 Yeah, guess I've got a lot to learn 
 Don't leave me here 
 You said You would not forsake me 
 But You never said that You wouldn't break me 
 To make me over in the image of You 
 In the dark night of the soul 
 When there's no comfort in prayin' 
 Not a moment's pleasure in strayin' 
 You're the only shelter I know 
 I'm growing, I don't like it 
 I'm growing and it hurts 
 I love You, but, God, I'm tired 
 I guess I've got a lot to learn 
 Yes, I've got a lot to learn 
 When feelings fail 
 When "close enough" isn't good enough 
 When "full enough" just isn't full enough 
 Your grace will be sufficient for me 
 No wind to sail 
 No rain to water the flower 
 In my most desperate hour 
 Oh, You will be the strength that I need 
 I'm growing, I don't like it 
 I'm growing and it hurts 
 I love You, but I'm tired 
 I guess I've got a lot to learn 
 Yeah, guess I've got a lot to learn

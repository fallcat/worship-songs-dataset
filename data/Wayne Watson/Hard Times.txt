Hey, did I hear you say 
 You've fallen on some hard times? 
 That your dreams are crushed 
 And scattered to the wind 
 And if there's a someday 
 When the pain will be forgotten 
 Right now, it's too much 
 For your heart to comprehend 
 You say you wish that you 
 Could get back to the good times 
 Back when life and love 
 And plans fell into place 
 Before the floods came 
 Before the dam started breaking 
 Back when the waves kept their distance 
 From your faith 
 But in the hard times 
 When your world has gone to pieces 
 You pick up the one piece 
 That matters most 
 'Cause in hard times 
 You learn to hold on to Jesus 
 Oh, there's no other place 
 To know the strength of your faith 
 But in the hard times 
 Now in the busy times 
 You hold on to the calendar 
 Then in the easy times 
 You pick up on your sleep 
 And in the half times 
 You learn to stop, look and listen 
 Then in the clutch you learn 
 To stand and take the heat, yeah 
 Oh, but in the hard times 
 When your world has gone to pieces 
 You pick up the one piece 
 That matters most 
 'Cause in hard times 
 You learn to hold on to Jesus 
 Oh, there's no other place 
 To know the strength of your faith 
 But in the hard times 
 When your world as gone to pieces 
 You pick up the one piece 
 That matters most 
 'Cause in hard times 
 You learn to hold on to Jesus 
 Oh, there's no other place 
 To know the strength of your faith 
 But in the hard times 
 Oh, but in the hard times, mmm...

Inside my heart of hearts 
 You have delivered me 
 Messiah, You calmed the raging sea 
 Inside my heart of hearts 
 No one's been to my secret hiding place 
 Guilt and sin, alive there, disguised there 
 Could Love break through so my heart could smile again 
 Piercing the walls and repairing the halls of my mind 
 Oh, how Your Love can shine 
 Inside my heart of hearts 
 You have delivered me 
 Messiah, You calmed the raging sea 
 Inside my heart of hearts 
 Lord of Truth, Your timeless Love has shown 
 How God, through You, became man, to save man 
 My heart will tell that this mighty Love can do 
 Inside my heart of hearts 
 You have delivered me 
 Messiah, You calmed the raging sea 
 Inside my heart of hearts 
 Piercing the walls and repairing the halls of my mind 
 Breaking the binds of fear I'd been hiding behind 
 Oh, how Your Love can shine 
 Inside my heart of hearts 
 You have delivered me 
 Messiah, You calmed the raging sea 
 Inside my heart of hearts 
 Inside my heart of hearts

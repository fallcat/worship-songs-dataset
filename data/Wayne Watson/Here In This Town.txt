Here in this town 
 They all all know Your name 
 But the way they treat You 
 They ought to be ashamed 
 It's getting hard to hold Your head up 
 Here in this town 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 You don't want to see us now 
 I'm not sure one righteous man could be found 
 (Ooh, la, la-la) 
 Here in this town 
 Here in this town 
 They all say Your name 
 Sunday, it's holy 
 Monday, profane 
 How long before You bring this place 
 To the ground 
 Ooh, yeah 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 You don't want to see us now 
 I'm not sure one righteous man could be found 
 (Ooh, la, la-la) 
 Here in this town 
 Here in this town 
 They all know the truth 
 Quote verse and chapter 
 Oh, but they don't know You 
 It's living happy ever after 
 Here in this town, yeah 
 Ooh, yeah 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 You don't want to see us now 
 I'm not sure one righteous man could be found 
 (Ooh, la, la-la) 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 You don't want to see us now 
 I'm not sure one righteous man could be found 
 (Ooh, la, la-la) 
 Here in this town 
 Here in this town 
 Here in this town, ooh... 
 Yeah, here in this town

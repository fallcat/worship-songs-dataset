Consume me, resume the rule of me 
 I've made a fool of me for so long 
 Rebuild me, ablaze with Holy Fire 
 By my one desire, be my song 
 Sailing this unrighteous sea, all my hope is in You 
 Bright Morning Star, High King of Heaven 
 Holiness, Holiness 
 Oh, how my heart beats for Thee 
 Holiness, Holiness 
 I wanna heart that's promised to be 
 Consigned to purity 
 Control me, console me when I fall 
 Lord, after all, I am but dust 
 Receive me, retrieve these wandering hands 
 That I may stand before You just 
 Lord, be my vision and my light to illumine my way 
 Strength to the weak, help of the helpless 
 Holiness, Holiness 
 Oh, how my heart beats for Thee 
 Holiness, Holiness 
 I wanna heart that's promised to be 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 Holiness, Holiness 
 Oh, how my heart beats for Thee 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 Holiness, Holiness 
 I wanna heart that's promised to be 
 Consigned to purity

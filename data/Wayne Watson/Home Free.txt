I'm trying hard not to think You unkind 
 But, Heavenly Father, if You know my heart 
 Surely You can read my mind 
 Good people underneath a sea of grief 
 Some get up and walk away 
 Some will find ultimate relief 
 Home free, eventually 
 At the ultimate healing 
 We will be home free 
 Home free, oh, I've got a feeling 
 At the ultimate healing 
 We will be home free 
 Out in the corridors we pray for life 
 A mother for her baby, a husband for his wife 
 Oh, sometimes the good die young 
 It's sad but true 
 And while we pray for one more heartbeat 
 The real comfort is with You 
 You know pain has little mercy 
 And suffering's no respecter of age 
 Of race or position 
 I know every prayer gets answered 
 But the hardest one to pray is slow to come 
 Oh, Lord, not mine, but Your will be done 
 Oh, let it be... 
 Home free, eventually 
 (We'll be going home) 
 At the ultimate healing we will be Home Free 
 Home free, oh, I've got a feeling 
 (Gotta feeling) 
 At the ultimate healing 
 We will be home free 
 (Gonna be home) 
 Home free, eventually 
 Oh, at the ultimate healing gonna be Home Free 
 Home free, oh, it's more than a feeling 
 At the ultimate healing 
 We're gonna be home free 
 Home, home free 
 We're gonna be home 
 (Home free) 
 Ooh, the ultimate healing 
 (Gonna be home) 
 Gonna be home free 
 Gonna be home 
 Good to be home 
 Home free 
 Gonna be home 
 Gonne be home free

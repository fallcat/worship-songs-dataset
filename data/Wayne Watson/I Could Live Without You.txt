I could live without You 
 I know I could get by 
 Millions of people do 
 Why couldn't I 
 I could live without You 
 Through the motions once again 
 Maybe even laugh and smile 
 Oblivious to sin 
 But why should I merely survive 
 Content with just being alive 
 The best life can offer, the world and its gold 
 Is nothing to the treasure of Your hold 
 I could live without You 
 But what would living be 
 Not a chance of escaping Hell 
 A dark eternity 
 Now I have the strength to say 
 Lord, I've seen life from both shores 
 Before I chose You, Jesus, You chose me 
 Now find me, find me fully Yours

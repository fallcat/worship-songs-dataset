Oh, one thing I remember from the time I was a child 
 Rollin' off to Sunday school 
 There I'd learn about the Bible, learn about the Lord 
 And I'd learn about the Golden Rule 
 "Write it down on your heart", they'd say 
 So when you're tried, you're never caught of guard 
 And to this very day even when I go astray 
 I never wander off too far, no 
 Well, livin' in the '80s can be a little strange 
 Distractions on every hand 
 The talk of nuclear war and a social revolution 
 And the evolution theory of man 
 Well, it's easier for me to believe that the Creator 
 In a moment just said "Let it be" 
 Than to swallow some jive about crawlin' from the ocean 
 Or swingin' down from the trees 
 'Cause ya see, I still believe 
 Oh-oh-oh, I still believe 
 Too many prayers have been answered 
 And too many fallen redeemed 
 So I still believe, yeah 
 Not so long ago, the papers ran a story 
 The headlines said that God is dead 
 Now they use the name of Jesus like a four-letter word 
 They oughta call it out in prayer instead 
 Pardon me, but that name that you're abusin' 
 Is livin' in my heart today 
 And I'll be praying for you that you will find Him too 
 But for now, no matter what you say 
 Oh-oh, I still believe 
 Oh-oh-oh, I still believe 
 Too many prayers have been answered 
 And too many fallen redeemed 
 So I still believe, yeah, yeah 
 Oh, I've heard the demons believe and they tremble 
 But there's a difference between them and me, ya see 
 'Cause my name's forever written in the book of life 
 I'll be singin' in eternity 
 'Cause ya see, I still believe 
 Oh-oh-oh, I still believe 
 Too many prayers have been answered 
 And too many fallen redeemed 
 So I still believe 
 I still believe 
 Oh-oh-oh, I still believe 
 Too many prayers have been answered 
 And too many fallen redeemed 
 So I still believe, yeah, yeah 
 I still believe 
 Oh-oh-oh, I still believe 
 Too many prayers have been answered 
 And too many fallen redeemed 
 So I still, I still believe

If I were You, if I ran this place 
 There wouldn't be no mercy, no 
 There wouldn't be no grace 
 And people that wander off and go astray 
 I'd make real sure that they would pay 
 Yeah, that's what I'd do if I were You 
 And if I were You, if I ran this town 
 The righteous would be sitting pretty 
 And the rotten would come tumbling down 
 Oh, they'd beg and they'd wrangle for a second chance 
 I'd say, "sorry, boys, but I just can't" 
 Yeah, that's what I'd do if I were You 
 But You know me, I'm just a man 
 Of unclean lips and unclean hands 
 Some of the thoughts I have 
 Make me want to run and hide, yeah 
 Well, I don't know much, but I observe 
 You've never treated me like I deserve 
 Your loving arms are always open wide, yeah, yeah 
 Oh, well, You know me, I'm just a man 
 Of unclean lips and unclean hands 
 Some of the thoughts I have 
 Make me want to run and hide, run and hide 
 Well, I don't know much, but I've observe 
 You've never treated me like I deserve 
 Your loving arms are always open wide, open wide 
 If I were You, oh, catastrophe, ooh... 
 I wonder what in the world 
 Kind of world would this world be 
 I guess I'll take my place 
 Wrapped in amazing grace 
 Let You be You 
 Uh-huh, that's what I'll do 
 Yeah, that's what I'll do 
 Yeah, that's what I'll do, ooh...

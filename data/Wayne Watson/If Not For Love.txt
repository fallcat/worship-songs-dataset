In time, they say, old wounds will heal 
 But time alone would just reveal 
 The measure of my best intent 
 How vainly it would all be spent 
 Empty boxes, if not for Love 
 My prayer never would be heard 
 Appeal denied without a word 
 The throne room of my Father's house 
 Closed fast just to keep me out 
 No admission, if not for Love 
 If not for Love, the godless would reign 
 If not for Love, any light would be shadowed 
 But Love was strong, revealed a plan 
 Man's perfect God, God's perfect man 
 A cross would stand alone refused 
 A Son blessed and not accused 
 A Savior never sent 
 Blind to the world's lament 
 No forgiveness, if not for Love 
 No forgiveness, if not for Love 
 If not for Love

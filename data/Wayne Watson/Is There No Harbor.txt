Water into wine, weeping into laughter 
 In another time, another age 
 Healing of the blind, stillness from disaster 
 Lookin' for a sign, we turn the page 
 And the pressures of a reckless society 
 Are enough to make a strong man's knees go weak 
 And the questions from the masses 
 Filled with anxiety seem to be sayin' 
 Oh, you can hear them prayin' 
 Is there no harbor 
 Is there no resting place 
 Is there no refuge, no quiet sound 
 Is there no lighthouse 
 Is there no peace be still 
 Is there no anchor to higher ground 
 Some days I can find, power for the hour 
 On the battled line against the rage 
 Confidence is high like a mighty tower 
 Still I question: "why do I have these weaker days?" 
 And will retreat become my battle cry tonight 
 No, no, I can see the revelation 
 And it's bringin' the Truth to light 
 There is a harbor 
 There is a resting place 
 There is a refuge, a quiet sound 
 There is a lighthouse 
 There is a peace be still 
 There is an anchor to higher ground 
 Yeah, there is a harbor 
 There is a resting place 
 There is a refuge, the quiet sound 
 There is a lighthouse 
 There is a peace be still 
 There is an anchor to higher ground 
 There is a harbor 
 There is a resting place 
 There is a refuge, a quiet sound 
 There is a lighthouse 
 There is a peace be still...

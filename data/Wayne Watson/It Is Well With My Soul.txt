Oh, when peace like a river attendeth my way 
 When sorrows like sea billows roll 
 Whatever my lot, You have taught me to say 
 "All is well, it is well with my soul" 
 Though Satan should taunt me, though trials should come 
 Let this blessed assurance control 
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate 
 And has shed his own blood for my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well, it is well with my soul 
 Oh, and, Lord, hurry the day when the faith shall be sight 
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll 
 The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend 
 Even so, it is well with my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 It is well, it is well with my soul 
 It is well with my soul 
 With my soul, with my soul 
 Oh, it is well 
 (With my soul, yes, it is well) 
 With my soul 
 (With my soul, yes, it is well) 
 Yes, it is well, oh, with my soul 
 Yes, it is well, yes, it is well 
 Oh, with my soul 
 Yes, it is well 
 Yes, it is well with my soul 
 It is well

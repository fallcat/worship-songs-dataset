It happened many years ago 
 The memories still haunt you though 
 And who's to blame, you really don't know 
 You're just locked all alone in these chains 
 Sometimes it's hard to live at all 
 The pictures of your history call 
 Your mind's a decorated wall 
 But the Lord has the cure for your pain 
 It's time, come back to the land of the living 
 Come home to the land of forgiving 
 Jesus will be faithful to the end 
 It's time, break the tangled webs that bind you 
 Let the grace of God unwind you 
 Give the Lord your broken heart to mend 
 It's time, it's time 
 You've had your little victories 
 But perfection's pretty hard to please 
 And guilt is an annoying breeze 
 That blows all that's peaceful away 
 Oh, and your life is too short to go on living like this 
 Or to brood over who's done you wrong 
 If the years pass you by, look at all that you'll miss 
 You've been walking in shadows too long 
 It's time, come back to the land of the living 
 Come home to the land of forgiving 
 Jesus will be faithful to the end 
 It's time, break the tangled webs that bind you 
 Let the grace of God unwind you 
 Give the Lord your broken heart to mend, to mend 
 It's time, break the tangled webs that bind you 
 Let the grace of God unwind you 
 Give the Lord your broken heart to mend 
 It's time, it's time 
 It's time, it's time

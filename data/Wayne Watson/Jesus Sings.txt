Jesus sings easy from my heart 
 Sweet from my soul 
 Jesus falls softer on my ear 
 Than others I know 
 Inscribed across my dark places 
 Or carved forever in stone 
 He seems to be most at home 
 Written deep in me 
 Jesus in neon or written across the skies 
 Sung out in praises, whispered in lullabys 
 One thing we agree on 
 No other name can bring such calm 
 Oh, no other one more worthy to be sung 
 Jesus sings easy from my heart 
 Sweet from my soul 
 Jesus falls softer on my ear 
 Than others I know 
 Inscribed across my dark places 
 Or carved forever in stone 
 Oh, He seems to be most at home 
 Written deep in me 
 On through the ages, faces have come and gone 
 Of men of power, doers of right and wrong 
 Not much eternal, not much but cloudy memories 
 Oh, but not so with Jesus 
 His name and His power lives on in you and me 
 Jesus sings easy from my heart 
 Sweet from my soul 
 Jesus falls softer on my ear 
 Than others I know 
 Oh, inscribed across my dark places 
 Or carved forever in stone 
 Oh, He seems to be most at home 
 Written deep in me 
 Written deep in me 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh... 
 Jesus sings easy from my heart 
 Sweet from my soul 
 Jesus falls softer on my ear 
 Than others I know 
 Oh, inscribed across my dark places 
 Or carved forever in stone 
 Oh, He seems to be most at home 
 Oh, He seems to be most at home 
 Oh, He seems to be most at home 
 Written deep in me, yeah 
 Written deep in me 
 Oh... 
 Written deep inside of me 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

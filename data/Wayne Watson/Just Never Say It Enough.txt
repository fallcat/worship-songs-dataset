If I called you every time that I think of you 
 The phone would be ringin' all day 
 I keep thinkin' that these feelings would mellow with time 
 But not yet, no way 
 We've had our share of heartache and trouble 
 We can look back and laugh at it now 
 But a mystery keeps haunting me 
 How you hurt those you love most somehow, somehow 
 A real love expression is long overdue 
 Hear my confession of my love for you 
 I just never say it enough 
 So before it's too late and time's up 
 You're more than all I dreamed you'd be 
 An answered prayer, gift of God above 
 Oh, I just never say it enough 
 I believe God inhabits a human heart 
 I believe it more now than ever before 
 I see His reflection in you, in you 
 And I'm sure, I'm sure 
 But a real love expression is long overdue 
 Hear my confession of my love for you 
 I just never say it enough 
 So before it's too late and time's up 
 You're more than all I dreamed you'd be 
 An answered prayer, gift of God above 
 Oh, I just never say it enough 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... 
 Oh, I just never say it 
 I just never say it enough 
 No, I just never say it 
 I just never say it enough, no

So we've grown in the knowledge of the truth 
 Lotta channels on TV people talking about You 
 Big guns big opinions big ideas 
 "Congratulations look at us" 
 There's a lot of that around here 
 We've come far from our humble early days 
 I get this feeling we've maybe gone astray 
 We're a long way from the manger 
 From the pure, simple Divine 
 Long way from the innocence of the Stranger 
 Is this what You had in mind? 
 No, my heart ain't always heavy like this 
 There's a joy in me I'm thankful to be His 
 I can't help but wonder just the same 
 Is this progress that we're making 
 Or should we maybe be ashamed? 
 Not an easy question and the answers disappear 
 Behind these mountains of pride 
 If anything we're going breaks You heart or brings You tears 
 Before I wander any further, give me eyes to see it clear 
 We've come far from our humble early days 
 I get this feeling we've maybe gone astray 
 We're a long way from the manger 
 From the pure, simple Divine 
 Long way from the innocence of the Stranger 
 Is this what You had in mind? 
 Is this what You had in mind?

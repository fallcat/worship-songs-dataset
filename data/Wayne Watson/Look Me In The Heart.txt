Look in my eyes, you might see a dim reflection 
 Of a memory or a recollection of a day gone before 
 Then I was wise, at least within my own beholdin' 
 Oh, the vanity of youth was golden when my way was my own 
 But when you look me in the heart 
 You'll see that I'm changin' 
 When you look me in the heart 
 His holiness shows 
 'Cause underneath this mortal frame 
 The Lord is reigning 
 You will see Him 
 When you look me in the heart 
 Follow my dreams, fantasies that cloud my vision 
 That tie me up in indecision about which way to go 
 When the fantasies fade, with reality again my portion 
 Father, be my only fortune, let my desire be Your own 
 And if my actions speak loud 
 And my words seem to be all too human 
 It's just that often I choose not to move 
 With the flow of His hand 
 But when you look me in the heart 
 You'll see that I'm changin' 
 When you look me in the heart 
 His holiness shows 
 'Cause underneath this mortal frame 
 The Lord is reigning 
 You will see Him when you look 
 Can you see Him 
 When you look me in the heart

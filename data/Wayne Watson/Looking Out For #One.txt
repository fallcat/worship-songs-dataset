They advertise it on the television 
 I hear them plug it on the radio 
 How we've come to this, I really do not know 
 Giving glory to the human race now 
 Man's evolving to a "higher plane" 
 We will see the wrath of God if things don't change 
 People lead about by blind ambition 
 And nobody wants to be outdone 
 And they say ya gotta look out for number one 
 Jesus is still in control of my life 
 He's the Master and second to none 
 One day the Lord will break open the sky 
 So I guess you could say I'm looking out 
 I'm looking out for number One 
 Using people just to gain position 
 Whatever happened to the Golden Rule 
 We've become a generation of power hungry fools, yeah 
 People living for their reputation 
 To make a name that everyone will know 
 What will it take to show ya life's no one man show 
 If ya think that life is out to get you 
 And you feel you've gotta protect yourself 
 Turn it over to the One who knows you so well 
 Jesus is still in control of my life 
 He's the Master and second to none 
 One day the Lord will break open the sky 
 So I guess you could say I'm looking out 
 I'm looking out for number One 
 Oh, Jesus is still in control of my life 
 He's the Master and second to none 
 Oh, one day the Lord will break open the sky 
 So I guess you could say I'm looking out 
 I'm looking out for number One 
 I'm looking out for number One 
 I'm looking out for number One 
 Yeah, yeah, 
 I'm looking out!

Pressure's on, I can't slow down 
 Got to make it 'fore the best years pass me by 
 Up before dawn, building my crown 
 In my own eyes, it's a noble sacrifice 
 I spend my time 
 Tryin' to make a little hay 
 Before the sun stops shinin' 
 Material magic 
 Got a spell on me one more time 
 Pile it high, save it up for a rainy day, yeah 
 For surprises, unexpected tragedy 
 The funny thing is it can all blow away 
 Leave ya broken, leave ya beggin' down on your knees 
 It makes good sense 
 Till the walls of my security 
 Come crashin' in 
 Material magic 
 Got a spell on me one more time 
 You know the checkbooks and the credit cards go flyin' 
 You can get 'em in the mail before you apply 
 Can my limit take the weight of what I'm buyin' 
 Good money down on my own slice of the pie 
 Are we crazy or just out of control 
 That we bow down to what money can buy 
 Seems like people will trade in their souls 
 For the pleasure, for the ecstasy of the eye 
 Does Jesus weep 
 That I spend my time collectin' 
 What I cannot keep 
 I heard Him say 
 Lay your treasure up 
 Where the hands of time cannot decay 
 Material magic 
 Got a spell on me one more time 
 (Oh, got a spell on me, yeah) 
 Oh-whoa, material magic 
 Got a spell on me one more time 
 Oh, no, not this time 
 Material magic 
 Got a spell on me one more time 
 Oh-whoa, material magic 
 Got a spell on me one more time 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Oh, material magic 
 Got a spell on me one more time

Merciful Heaven, have mercy on me 
 Seven times seven, I've always believed 
 You've got the power and I have the need 
 Merciful Heaven, have mercy on me 
 Some people want what they deserve 
 But not me, no, I know my heart too well 
 And I've just barely got the nerve 
 Just to make this one request 
 And I know that You will hear me 
 Merciful Heaven, have mercy on me 
 Seven times seven, I've always believed 
 That You've got the power and I have the need 
 Merciful Heaven, have mercy on me 
 This is a place where I can live 
 At Your feet forgiven perfectly 
 'Cause I've got nothing good to give 
 Nothing more than just myself 
 I know You want for nothing else, oh... 
 Merciful Heaven, have mercy on me 
 Seven times seven, I've always believed 
 That You've got the power and I have the need 
 So, Merciful Heaven, have mercy on me 
 Oh, yeah, Merciful Heaven, have mercy on me 
 Yeah, seven times seven, I've always believed 
 That You've got the power and I have the need 
 Merciful, Merciful Heaven, have mercy 
 Merciful Heaven, have mercy

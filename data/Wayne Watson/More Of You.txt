Thought I could give her everything 
 The fairytale, the rainbow's end 
 Oh, but happiness is not for sale 
 The rules of God, I could not bend 
 Foolish and young, you set your eyes 
 On the American dream 
 Then when you faint from the run 
 You realize the answer is easy to see 
 And all she really needs from me 
 Is more of You 
 That's all she really needs from me 
 I know it is, I know it's true, yeah 
 More understanding, more tenderness 
 A love that goes beyond my humanness 
 That's all she really needs from me 
 Is more of You, more of You 
 Now today, I'm not the same 
 As the man I used to be, no 
 But the very best that can be said 
 Jesus is alive and well in me 
 Oh, but every now and then 
 The pressure builds, anxiety grows, no 
 Old habits reappear, frustration's real 
 But inside I know, I know 
 That all she really needs from me 
 Is more of You 
 That's all she really needs from me 
 I know it is, I know it's true, I do 
 More understanding, more tenderness 
 A love that goes beyond my humanness 
 That's all she really needs from me 
 Is more of You, more of You 
 So this will be my prayer today 
 The same tomorrow, forever 
 That I will keep Your love displayed, oh 
 For all around to see 
 That's all she really needs from me, yeah 
 More understanding, more tenderness 
 A love that goes beyond my humanness 
 That's all, that's all she needs from me 
 Is a little more of You 
 That's all, that's all she needs 
 More of You, more, more, more 
 A little more of You

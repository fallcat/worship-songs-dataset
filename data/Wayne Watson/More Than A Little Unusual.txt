Everybody's picking on you 
 You're not like everybody else 
 And even when the big bad world 
 Backs off just a little 
 You're still pretty hard on yourself 
 Feel like you just don't fit in 
 But your faith, your conviction is strong 
 And just because you march to the beat 
 Of a different drummer 
 Hey, that doesn't mean that you're wrong 
 You see, Jesus was a rebel 
 Do ya think He cared? 
 What people thought about Him? 
 If they thought He was weird 
 It didn't keep Him from His mission 
 It didn't keep Him from His call 
 He was more than a little unusual 
 I tell ya, He was more than a little unusual 
 You gotta watch out who you're hang around 
 Watch out who your listening to 
 AAnd just because it's on TV 
 Or you read it in the paper 
 Hey, that doesn't mean that it's true 
 Sometimes you're paddling upstream 
 And sometimes you gotta go with the flow 
 Which is which and what is what 
 And when to do whatever 
 Oh, God, You gotta help us to know 
 You see, Jesus was a rebel 
 Do ya think He cared? 
 What people thought about Him? 
 If they thought He was weird 
 It didn't keep Him from His mission 
 It didn't keep Him from His call 
 He was more than a little unusual 
 I believe He was more than a little unusual 
 Don't wanna be tied to the things of the world 
 By the strings of the world, no 
 I wanna walk a mile in Your shoes, Jesus 
 Do what You do, go where You go 
 'Cause I tell ya, Jesus was a rebel 
 Do ya think He cared? 
 What people thought about Him? 
 If they thought He was weird 
 It didn't it keep Him from His mission, 
 Keep Him from His call 
 He was more than a little unusual, yeah 
 More than a little 
 More than a little unusual, yeah 
 I believe, He was more, He was more 
 He was more than a little unusual 
 He was more, yeah, He was more 
 He was more than a little unusual 
 He was more, yeah, He was more 
 He was more than a little unusual

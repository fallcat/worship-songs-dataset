My temple is built of wood and of stone 
 Each space is filled with the things that I own 
 Idols and gods that call me to bow 
 Well, I try to be free but there's no freedom now 
 No freedom now 
 The ones I hold dear, those most precious to me 
 Some days I set them afloat on an indifferent sea 
 And these things in first place, they're worth nothing at all 
 At night in my dreams, graven images call 
 And my gods won't let me sleep 
 And what a man sows that he will reap 
 And I toss and turn at night 
 I've got places to go, I've got battles to fight 
 And my gods won't let me sleep tonight 
 Tonight, tonight 
 Ambitions once good, once noble and pure 
 Now rule with a rod and I cannot endure 
 These bonds I have forged with two willing hands 
 They're not easily torn by the strength of a man 
 And my gods won't let me sleep 
 And what a man sows that he will reap 
 And I toss and I turn at night 
 I've got places to go, I've got battles to fight 
 And my gods won't let me sleep 
 They won't let me sleep tonight, no 
 No other gods before You, no other holy shrines 
 Oh, I want to sleep in peace when I lie down 
 All other voices calling 
 All of the hands that pull me 
 Call and demand allegiance to their crown 
 And my gods won't let me sleep 
 What a man sows that he will reap 
 And I toss and I turn at night 
 I've got places to go, I've got battles to fight 
 And my gods won't let me sleep 
 And what a man sows that he will reap 
 And I toss and I turn at night 
 I've got places to go, I've got battles to fight 
 And my gods, they won't let me sleep 
 Won't let me sleep tonight 
 Let me sleep 
 Let me sleep, tonight 
 Won't let me sleep tonight 
 Please, let me sleep, tonight 
 Please, let me sleep, tonight 
 They won't let me sleep tonight 
 I toss and I turn 
 I toss and I turn 
 They won't let me sleep tonight

One of these days, I'm gonna break down and cry 
 For the world full of sorrow an sin 
 One of these days, I'm gonna break down and cry 
 But for now I'm gonna hold it in 
 Somebody's got to be strong 
 Be a harbor for the weak and the innocent 
 All the world around me says, "Hey, be a man" 
 But I ain't no machine, say, what do they mean?" 
 Tell me, what do they mean? 
 One of these days, I'm gonna break down and cry 
 For the world full of sorrow an sin 
 Yeah, one of these days, I'm gonna break down and cry 
 But for now I'm gonna hold it in 
 Don't let my heart grow so cold 
 So hard against the plot of my enemy 
 That I can't feel the suffering 
 And I can't see the pain of the hearts that ache 
 For Jesus' sake 
 It means so little to put on this face 
 When really I've got nothing to prove 
 You know my heart from the inside out 
 I can't hide from You 
 These tears are way overdue 
 But not here, not now 
 No, not now 
 One of these days 
 Yeah, one of these days, I'm gonna break down and cry 
 For the world full of sorrow an sin 
 Yeah, one of these days, I'm gonna break down and cry 
 But for now I'm gonna hold it in 
 Yeah, one of these days, I'm gonna break down and cry 
 But for now I'm gonna hold it in 
 Yeah, for now, I'm just gonna hold it in 
 Yeah, for now, I'm gonna hold it in 
 Yeah 
 One of these days

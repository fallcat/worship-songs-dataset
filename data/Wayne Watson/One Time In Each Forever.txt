One time in each forever 
 One time in every always 
 From the pains of birth of a universe 
 'Til the worlds crash to an end 
 One time in each forever 
 For all of our wrongs together 
 Once was enough to cover us 
 One time and never again 
 Jesus, my Savior 
 Once and forever 
 From the beginning 
 After the end 
 Jesus, my Savior 
 Once and forever 
 Innocent blood 
 Forgiving flood 
 Once and for all 
 For all that have gone before me 
 And all that will follow after 
 Living in peace or with disaster 
 There's One Way, One Truth, One Life 
 For every eye that's weeping 
 And for every soul that's pleading 
 For every heart that's broken needing love 
 Jesus, my Savior 
 Once and forever 
 From the beginning 
 And after the end 
 Jesus, my Savior 
 Once and forever 
 Innocent blood 
 Forgiving flood 
 Once and for all 
 Oh, Jesus, my Savior 
 Once and forever 
 Innocent blood 
 Forgiving flood 
 Once and for all 
 Ooh, once and for all

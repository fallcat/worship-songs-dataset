Two hands on the wheel 
 Thought I could navigate this highway 
 What will the road reveal 
 I'm goin' nowhere takin' my way 
 Not even sure of my destination 
 'Til I give it up to the Lord of my salvation 
 Finally out of control 
 Finally out of my mind 
 Come on, move me out, Jesus 
 It's about time 
 Finally out of control 
 Out of my mind 
 I lie awake sometimes 
 And try to orchestrate my destiny 
 Pretend the fool is wise 
 When God alone can know the best for me 
 Two on the throne is a sure disaster 
 Make Yourself at home, Lord and Master 
 Finally out of control 
 Finally out of my mind 
 Come on, move me out, Jesus 
 It's about time 
 Finally out of control 
 Oh, finally out of control 
 Finally out of my mind 
 Come on, move me out, Jesus 
 It's about time 
 Finally out of control 
 Out of my mind 
 Out of my mind 
 And when I take the reigns, God take me back again 
 More of You and Father, less of me 
 Before I go too far, rescue my foolish heart 
 I want to be, no, I've got to be 
 Whoa, finally out of control 
 Finally out of my mind 
 Whoa, move me out, Jesus 
 It's about time 
 Finally out of control 
 Whoa-whoa 
 Finally out of control 
 Finally out of my mind 
 Come on, move me out, Jesus 
 It's about time 
 Finally out of control 
 Out of my mind 
 Out of my mind 
 Finally out of control 
 I'm finally out of my mind 
 I'm finally out of control 
 I'm finally out of my mind 
 I'm finally out of control 
 I'm finally out of my mind

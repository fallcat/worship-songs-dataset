Seasons of my soul, they come and go 
 But as they slip away I know 
 Something else remains that will not change 
 Places in my heart are torn apart 
 But in my brokenness I find 
 Something stays behind that will not change 
 The peace that passes understanding 
 Is a blessing that will never fade away 
 The peace that passes understanding is here to stay 
 The peace that passes understanding never passes away 
 Lord, in times alone, my heart has known 
 The quiet words of Your tender love 
 And Your gentle touch that changes me 
 Even through the storm, I'm safe and I'm warm 
 For You have covered me with grace 
 In Your hiding place I am at peace 
 Peace comes like the dawn 
 Peace like the world can't understand 
 You take my hand and I stand 
 Though others may fall 
 The peace that passes understanding 
 Is a blessing that will never fade away 
 The peace that passes understanding is here to stay 
 The peace that passes understanding never passes away 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh... 
 The peace that passes understanding 
 Is a blessing that will never fade away 
 The peace that passes understanding is here to stay 
 The peace that passes understanding never passes away 
 Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...

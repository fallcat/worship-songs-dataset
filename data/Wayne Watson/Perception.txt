They saw Me eatin' 
 At the table with the sinners 
 Tax collectors 
 The harlots and the thieves 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 Should I be more careful 
 'Bout what people are thinking 
 What they choose to believe 
 They saw Me talking 
 To that woman at the fountain 
 I heard 'em whisper 
 "What's He doing with her?" 
 Guess I can suffer 
 In people's estimation 
 For the transformation 
 Of one sinner to occur 
 Not losin' sleep over some bad perception 
 What people believe to be true 
 I'm gonna risk my reputation for the harvest 
 The fields are ready 
 Yeah, there's a lot to do 
 They'll see Me crucified 
 Hanging on a mountain 
 They'll say, I guess 
 He's just a criminal too 
 I hope they're listening 
 To hear Me when I whisper 
 Father, forgive them 
 They don't know what they do 
 Not losin' sleep over some bad perception 
 What people believe to be true 
 I'm gonna risk my reputation for the harvest 
 The fields are ready 
 There's a lot to do 
 The fields are ready 
 There's a lot to do 
 A lot to do 
 The fields are ready, oh 
 Not losin' sleep over some bad perception 
 What people believe to be true 
 I'm gonna risk my reputation for the harvest 
 Those fields are ready 
 Yeah, there's a lot to do 
 Yeah, those fields are ready 
 There's a lot to do 
 Ooh, we work the field of souls 
 Yeah, there's a lot to do 
 Oh-oh-oh-whoa...

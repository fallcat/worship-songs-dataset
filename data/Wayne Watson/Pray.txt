What can you do when your hands feel tied 
 And your friend is broken-hearted 
 You try to comfort but there's too many miles in the way 
 Well, you go back to the place where love began 
 Back to where love first started 
 Back to the feet of Jesus to the throne of Grace 
 Bring Him all of your worry 
 All of your despair 
 All of the tears, anytime, anywhere 
 You can pray 
 Yeah, you can pray 
 First thing at the top of the morning 
 On through to the end of the day 
 You can pray 
 Yeah, you can pray 
 Pray with all you've got 
 'Cause you know that you ought to 
 Hold them up, never stop, just pray 
 This is not some last resort 
 Some act of desperation 
 A string to pull when your hope has just faded away 
 I believe the humble righteous prayer 
 That can heal a broken nation 
 I believe a faithful God will hear us 
 And provide a way 
 Yeah, bring Him all of your worry 
 All your despair 
 All of your tears, anytime, anywhere 
 You can pray 
 Yeah, you can pray 
 First thing at the top of the morning 
 On through to the end of the day 
 You can pray 
 Oh, you can pray 
 Pray with all you've got 
 'Cause you know that you ought to 
 Hold them up, never stop 
 Just pray 
 Come on and pray 
 First thing at the top of the morning 
 On through, on through to the end of the day 
 Pray 
 (You got to pray) 
 You can pray 
 Pray with all you've got, never step 
 Hold them up, 'cause you know that you ought to 
 Pray with all your heart 
 We will find a way 
 And you just pray

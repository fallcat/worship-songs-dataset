Sometimes I feel I can walk on water 
 Sometimes I feel like I'd sink like a stone 
 Some days I feel like a king in a castle 
 Other days I feel like a man with no home 
 You know, sometimes I feel like a man on a mission 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm lost in space 
 Some days I hold to the law by the letter 
 Other days I lean on mercy and grace 
 Welcome to my rollercoaster 
 These ups and downs don't bother me 
 You see, God is rock steady 
 Faithful ever ready 
 Through the good and the bad 
 Through the pleasure, the pain 
 God is rock steady 
 Faithful ever ready 
 This worlds keeps changing 
 He is the same, oh... 
 He is the same 
 Sometimes I feel I've got a faith to move mountains 
 The tough get going, well, you know the rest 
 Some days I feel like old doubtin' Tommy 
 Crashing and a-burning with every single test 
 Welcome to my rollercoaster 
 These ups and downs don't bother me 
 You see, God is rock steady 
 Faithful ever ready 
 Through the good and the bad 
 Through the pleasure, the pain 
 God is rock steady 
 Faithful ever ready 
 This worlds keeps changing 
 Oh, my God is rock steady 
 You know, God is rock steady 
 Faithful ever ready 
 Through the good and the bad 
 God is rock steady 
 Faithful ever ready 
 This worlds keeps changing 
 He is the same 
 Oh, He is the same, yeah 
 God is rock steady 
 (Rock steady, He don't change) 
 (Rock steady, ooh-ooh...) 
 Oh, yeah, oh, yeah 
 (Rock steady, He don't change) 
 (Rock steady, ooh-ooh-ooh...) 
 (Rock steady, He don't change) 
 (Rock steady, ooh-ooh...)

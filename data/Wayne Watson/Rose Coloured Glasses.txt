Heavenly Father, have You got a moment 
 There's something I don't understand 
 How from Your window, watching Your children 
 You hold back the wrath of Your hand 
 Does Your window pane bear a lasting stain 
 That a sinful rain can't wash away 
 His gaze always passes 
 Through rose colored glasses 
 Every time He looks on my heart 
 And through love's forgiveness 
 Through purity's fire 
 I am my God's desire 
 Oh... 
 Heavenly Father, just one more question 
 I don't mean to take so much time 
 But tell me, how much did it hurt You 
 To give from Your garden 
 The most lovely rose from Your vine 
 When the petals fell, when the colors ran 
 Was it then and there You first saw me holy 
 Oh, whoa... 
 His gaze always passes 
 Through rose colored glasses 
 Every time He looks on my heart 
 And through love's forgiveness 
 Through purity's fire 
 I am my God's desire 
 Oh, His gaze always passes 
 Through rose colored glasses 
 Every time, all the time 
 He looks on my heart 
 And through love's forgiveness 
 Through purity's fire 
 I am my God's desire 
 Oh-oh-oh, I am my God's desire 
 I am my God's desire 
 Oh-oh-oh-whoa...

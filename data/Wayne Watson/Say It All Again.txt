If I've heard it once 
 Must've heard it a thousand times 
 But familiar truths get dusty 
 In a cold, sarcastic mind 
 From creation days 
 To the tales of Kings 
 To the baby born Messiah 
 Something deep inside me clings 
 So say it all again 
 Same old story, same old lines 
 I have heard it all before 
 But say it over one more time 
 Would you say it all again 
 Same old story, same old lines 
 It will warm my frozen heart 
 Could you say it over one more time 
 Oh, say it over one more time 
 And to this very day 
 Through the passing years 
 Under piles and piles of hidden memory 
 What is really true is really very clear 
 The spotless Lamb 
 And the cruel tree 
 And empty grave, the mystery 
 And the forgiveness offered to me, yeah 
 Say it all again 
 Same old story, same old lines 
 I have heard it all before 
 Could you say it over one more time 
 Say it all again 
 Same old story, same old lines 
 It will warm my frozen heart 
 Could you say it over one more time 
 Come on, say it over one more time 
 If the fairytales and legends 
 With the generations die 
 Still, the hope of all the ages 
 Will live on and on 
 It will live on 
 So say it all again 
 Same old story, same old lines 
 I have heard it all before 
 Could you just say it over 
 Say it over, say it over 
 Say it all again 
 Same old story, same old lines 
 It will warm my frozen heart 
 Could you just say it over one more time 
 Come on, come on 
 And say it over one more time 
 Could you just say it over one more time 
 Come on, say it, come on and say it 
 Say it over

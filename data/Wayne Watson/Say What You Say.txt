Dancin' happy, loose and carefree 
 Looks like everything's all right 
 Hey, that's not the way they told me sin would be 
 Lots of lonely days and sleepless nights 
 But if the end of sin is destruction 
 My heart should more than ever be moved 
 But the faithful shake their fingers at the TV screen 
 Hey, how'd the friends of Jesus ever get so mean 
 Say what you say 
 Out of love and compassion 
 Do what you do 
 For the sake of a soul 
 Be what you be 
 So the lost will glorify Jesus 
 When they get free, yeah 
 When they get free (yeah) 
 Sometimes us brothers and sisters 
 Are slow to the rescue but run to condemn 
 Hardhearted tongues that can blister 
 Salvation for me, but judgment for them 
 Right now, I'm praying for a softer heart 
 And spiritual eyes for my sight 
 Unless the journey for the world is changed 
 The fires of hell will burn brighter tonight 
 Say what you say 
 Out of love and compassion 
 Do what you do 
 For the sake of a soul 
 Be what you be 
 So the lost will glorify Jesus 
 When they get free 
 Say what you say 
 Out of love and compassion 
 Do what you do 
 For the sake of a soul 
 Be what you be 
 So the lost will glorify Jesus 
 When they get free 
 Jesus, when they get free 
 (They get free) 
 Say what you say 
 Out of love and compassion 
 Do what you do 
 For the sake of a soul 
 Be what you be 
 So the lost will glorify Jesus 
 When they get free 
 Say, say what you say 
 Out of love and compassion 
 Come on, do what you do 
 You gotta be what you be 
 So the lost will glorify Jesus 
 When they get free 
 Come on, say what you say 
 Out of love and compassion 
 Do what you do 
 For the sake of a soul 
 Be what you be 
 So the lost will glorify Jesus 
 When they get, they get free, yeah 
 Come on, do what you do, ooh-hoo 
 Be what you be 
 You gotta glorify Jesus 
 When they get free

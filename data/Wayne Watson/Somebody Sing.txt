The best is yet to come 
 Still this is not all bad 
 Everyday there's something to be thankful for 
 A reason to be glad 
 You are not along 
 And here's something else 
 Jesus lived and dies and He rose again 
 To overcome death and hell 
 Somebody sing everybody breathe Him in 
 Somebody sing everybody say amen 
 So you've have a bad day 
 How long has this been goin' on 
 You can't count 'em using all your fingers, all your toes 
 Well maybe that's too long 
 It's okay to feel bad 
 It's not a spiritual crime 
 You just don't want to live your whole life long in sorrow 
 The clock is tickin' it's time 
 Somebody sing everybody breathe Him in 
 Somebody sing everybody say amen 
 I might be the best at looking at the worst 
 But one of these days I will be free 
 Living in this blessing as one who was cursed 
 Well He's still chippin' away 
 And I'm still growin' 
 And He's still working on me 
 Somebody sing everybody breathe Him in 
 Somebody sing everybody

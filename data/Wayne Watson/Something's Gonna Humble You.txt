Something in this world's gonna humble you 
 It's gonna shake your heart 
 Gonna get your attention 
 No matter who you are 
 Before your life is through 
 There's a good chance that something's gonna humble you 
 I take no pleasure in the pain of others 
 And I'm sure you've figured this much out by now 
 But there will be trouble in this life 
 I don't meant o alarm you 
 Just through I would remind you 
 Somebody's gotta warn you 
 Just when you think you've got it all together 
 Out of a clear blue sky come stormy weather 
 And the best laid plans of both mice and me 
 Can do tumblin' down, you never know where, never know when 
 Something in this world's gonna humble you 
 It's gonna shake your heart 
 Gonna get your attention 
 No matter who you are 
 Before your life is through 
 There's a good chance that something's gonna humble you 
 What are you countin' on to never, never leave you 
 Never betray you, never deceive you 
 Stocks and bonds, fast cars and land 
 Perfect kids, a big 'ole house all the vanity, man 
 Well God will not be mocked, Make no mistake 
 You better humble yourself before it's too late 
 He might just tap you on the shoulder, drop a pebble on your head 
 Or drop a boulder in your path to stop you in your tracks cold 
 Lord, of the gallows of arrogance let me beware 
 And if You need, slap my self-righteous nose from the air 
 Something in this world's gonna humble you 
 It's gonna shake your heart 
 Gonna get your attention 
 No matter who you are 
 Before your life is through 
 There's a good chance that something's gonna humble you

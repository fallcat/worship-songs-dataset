Somewhere in the world today 
 A little girl will go out to play 
 All dressed up in mama's clothes 
 At least the way that I suppose it goes 
 Somewhere in the world tonight 
 Before she reaches to turn out the light 
 She'll be prayin' from a tender heart 
 A simple prayer that's a work of art 
 And I don't even know her name 
 But I'm prayin' for her just the same 
 That the Lord will write His name upon her heart 
 'Cause somewhere in the course of this life 
 A little boy will need a Godly wife 
 So hold on to Jesus, baby, wherever you are 
 Somewhere in the world out there 
 That little girl's learnin' how to care 
 She's pickin' up her mama's charms 
 Or maybe, swingin' 'round in her daddy's arms 
 Somewhere in the world to be 
 Though the future's not real clear to me 
 Theirs could be a tender love 
 Grounded in eternal love above 
 And I don't even know her name 
 But I'm prayin' for her just the same 
 That the Lord will write His name upon her heart 
 'Cause somewhere in the course of this life 
 My little boy will need a Godly wife 
 So hold on to Jesus, baby, wherever you are 
 Oh, hold on to Jesus, baby, wherever you are

Steal me away, steal me away 
 From the devils and the dealers 
 Who never satisfy me 
 Steal me away, steal me away 
 And wrap me in Your arms where nothing else can ever steal me away 
 I don't want to live here 
 But I don't want to leave 
 This old world is not my home 
 Since I've got to be here, face the music, and take some heat 
 Could we maybe go somewhere and find some quiet time along together? 
 Steal me away, steal me away 
 From the devils and the dealers 
 Who never satisfy me 
 Steal me away, steal me away 
 And wrap me in Your arms where nothing else can ever steal me away 
 Slings and arrows, sticks and stones 
 How much more can one heart take before it breaks? 
 Just a little more, I guess but 
 So there won't be more mistakes 
 Could we maybe go somewhere 
 And find some quiet time along together, Jesus? 
 Steal me away, steal me away 
 From the devils and the dealers 
 Who never satisfy me 
 Steal me away, steal me away 
 And wrap me in Your arms where nothing else 
 Can steal me away, steal me away 
 From the devils and the dealers 
 Who never satisfy me 
 Steal me away, steal me away 
 And wrap me in Your arms where nothing else can ever steal me away

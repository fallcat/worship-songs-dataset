Sticks and stones can break my bones 
 Lies can break my heart 
 Before you fire your poison tongue 
 Contemplate the scar 
 Forest lie in ruin 
 From a careless flame 
 This is our undoing 
 The tongue cannot be tamed 
 Oh, the tongue cannot be tamed 
 Ships upon the seven seas 
 Driven by the wind 
 Mastered by the pilot's hand 
 Submission in the end 
 He can turn the wheel one-handed 
 And the course is easily changed 
 It's hard to understand it 
 Why the tongue cannot be tamed 
 Oh, the tongue cannot be tamed 
 Fresh water from an unclean well, no 
 Fruit growing on a dying tree 
 No, it'll never be 
 The same breath, one then the other 
 Blessing and cursing 
 We praise God then abuse one another 
 I tell ya, this ought not be, no, no 
 I tell ya, this ought not be, no, no 
 Break the wild one, draw the reign 
 Bid him do your will 
 Yoke the oxen to the chain 
 Cultivate the hill 
 Beast and every creature 
 Move at your command 
 But who will be the teacher 
 Of the wayward tongue of man 
 It's a wayward tongue 
 (You know it is) 
 Fresh water from an unclean well, no, no 
 Fruit growing on a dying tree 
 No, it'll never be 
 The same breath, one then the other 
 Blessing and cursing 
 We praise God then abuse one another 
 Oh, I tell ya, this ought not be, no 
 Fresh water from an unclean well 
 No, no, no 
 Fruit growing on a dying tree 
 No, it'll never be 
 The same breath, one then the other 
 Blessing and cursing 
 We praise God then abuse one another 
 Oh, I tell ya, this ought not be, no, no, no 
 Ought not be, no, no 
 Ought not be, no, no 
 I tell ya, this ought not be 
 Stick and stones can break my bones 
 Lies can break my heart 
 Lies can break my heart 
 Stick and stones can break my bones 
 Lies can break my heart 
 No, no, no 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Boxes full of baby clothes 
 Stacked up near the roof 
 Boxes full of little baby shoes 
 Envelopes of baby hair 
 A homeless baby tooth 
 And every single shade of baby blue 
 He's through with pulling wagons now 
 Through with riding trikes 
 That first day without training wheels was hard 
 All that is ancient history 
 Let me tell ya what he likes, uh-huh 
 Racing up and down the driveway in my car, oh, no! 
 This is what can happen 
 When your girl becomes your spouse 
 The stork begins delivery at your door 
 Oh, one day, home sweet home 
 Will be quiet as a mouse 
 This is why we pray a whole lot more 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 (Oh, my head!) 
 Oh, teenager in the house 
 Well, recently a revelation started coming clear 
 That's right, son, you call those "girls" 
 Hey, can the phone be surgically implanted in the ear 
 He's reaching out and touching half the world 
 This is what can happen 
 When your girl becomes your spouse 
 The stork begins delivery at your door 
 (I've heard of that before) 
 Oh, one day, home sweet home 
 Will be quiet as a mouse 
 This is why we pray a whole lot more 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 Philosophy and wisdom 
 From the experts all agree 
 Parenthood can be a little rough 
 Oh, I can't speak for you 
 But listen I can speak for me 
 This pill will go down easier if ya just 
 Lighten up! 
 This is what can happen 
 When your girl becomes your spouse 
 The stork begins delivery at your door 
 (I've heard of that before) 
 Tell me, one day, home sweet home 
 Will be quiet as a mouse 
 This is why we pray a whole lot more 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 Hey! 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 One day, I'm gonna have a little talk 
 With that boy! 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house 
 Teenager in the house

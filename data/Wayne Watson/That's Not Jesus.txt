I read the mornin' paper 
 To my surprise and shame 
 Said a black eye of embarrassment 
 Been attached to Jesus' name 
 Some mortal man convicted 
 Of some moldy moral sin 
 And the skeptics wage their tongues and say 
 "There goes that Jesus again" 
 There goes that Jesus again 
 Oh, there He goes again 
 The story graced the TV 
 And the magazines too long 
 And if my heart ain't broken yet 
 There must be somethin' wrong 
 Because but for the grace of God 
 I know it could be me 
 And all that's left for me to do 
 Is to help the world to see 
 That's not Jesus 
 He doesn't carry on that way 
 Just some flesh and blood like you and me 
 Somehow gone astray 
 That's not Jesus, no 
 No matter what "they" say 
 He doesn't need me to defend Him 
 He just wants me to obey 
 Oh, He just wants me to obey 
 Oh, have you seen the masterpiece 
 Of Jesus on the cross 
 Well, if He's still a-hangin' there 
 I'm hopeless, I am lost 
 I believe the tomb is empty 
 And the stone's been rolled away 
 And because of all this trouble 
 I still feel compelled to say 
 That's not Jesus 
 He doesn't carry on that way 
 Just some flesh and blood like you and me 
 Somehow gone astray 
 That's not Jesus, no 
 No matter what "they" say 
 He doesn't need me to defend Him 
 He just wants me to obey 
 And if your vision of Him 
 Has gotten somehow blurred 
 By a stumbling soldier in the field 
 Well, I'd like to say "I'm sorry" 
 And remind you of one thing 
 One day all the Truth will be revealed 
 That's not Jesus, no 
 He doesn't carry on that way 
 Just some flesh and blood like you and me 
 Somehow gone astray 
 That's not Jesus, no 
 No matter what "they" say 
 He doesn't need me to defend Him 
 He just... 
 No, that's not Jesus 
 He doesn't carry on that way 
 Just some flesh and blood like you and me 
 Somehow gone astray 
 That's not Jesus, no 
 No matter what "they" say 
 He doesn't need me to defend Him 
 He just wants me to obey 
 He just wants me to obey 
 I said, He wants me to obey 
 Oh-oh-oh... 
 I said, He wants me to obey 
 He just wants me to obey 
 Yeah, yeah, He wants me to obey 
 Oh-oh-oh...

I don't believe we've met 
 But I know who you are 
 Your story made the papers 
 Most wanted ran your name 
 And the press called out for justice 
 For all the misery and the pain 
 Yeah, you must have stunned the gates of Heaven 
 He said, "It's easy to explain" 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That opened Heaven's door to let me in 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That washed away the guilt 
 That washed away 
 The guilt of all my sin 
 You know I can't help believing 
 That when we breathe our last 
 And we mercifully go free of earthly ties 
 And we wake up in that city 
 And behold the family 
 Who is there and who is missing 
 Well, we just might be surprised 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That opened Heaven's door to let me in 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That washed away the guilt 
 That washed away 
 The guilt of all my sin 
 I believe that there's reality in mercy after all 
 There is truth in being saved 
 By grace through faith 
 Yeah, I believe that when I'm called 
 To give an answer on that day 
 I'll be sure that my debt is paid 
 Gonna fall on my knees and say 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That opened Heaven's door to let me in 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That washed away the guilt 
 That washed away, I know 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That opened Heaven's door to let me in 
 I believe, I believe 
 It was the blood of Jesus 
 The blood of Jesus 
 That washed away the guilt 
 That washed away 
 The guilt of all my sin 
 Come on and tell me 
 (What can wash away my sin?) 
 I believe it's nothing but the blood 
 (What can wash away my sin?) 
 Nothing but the blood 
 (What can wash away my sin?) 
 Nothing, nothing but the blood 
 (What can wash away my sin?) 
 Nothing but the blood 
 (What can wash away my sin?) 
 Nothing, nothing but the blood 
 (What can wash away my sin?) 
 Nothing but the blood 
 (What can wash away my sin?)

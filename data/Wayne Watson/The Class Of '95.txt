Every tree is green again 
 In the wood out of my back door 
 Every spring that scene, again 
 Faithful coming as before 
 And every living thing is sure 
 With time to come of age 
 Just like girls and boys outgrow their toys 
 And reach to turn the page 
 To the class of '95 
 Congratulations are in line 
 God has surely been most faithful 
 He's been so much more than kind 
 So get ready to test your wings 
 And fly away, but when you do 
 Remember you are loved 
 And somebody here is always praying for you 
 So this is what I bargained for 
 Hushed hello and a rushed goodbye 
 And the old folks said I'd be amazed 
 At how quickly the time would fly 
 Oh, but even so, I'm thankful 
 That my God saw fit to lend 
 This child into my unworthy hands 
 Who's less a child now and more a friend 
 To the class of '95 
 Congratulations are in line 
 God has surely been most faithful 
 He's been so much more than kind 
 So get ready to test your wings 
 And fly away, but when you do 
 Just remember you are loved 
 And somebody here is always praying for you 
 Oh, I could pray, the road would rise to meet you 
 And that the wind would blow softly on your soul 
 But sometimes life can sure mistreat you 
 And troubled times will take their toll 
 And so the best that I can wish you 
 No, even better, some good, I will pray 
 Is that the Lord in mercy keeps you 
 And that you hold on to your childlike faith 
 Ooh, you gotta hold on, hold on, hold on 
 Hold on, yeah 
 To the class of '95 
 Congratulations are in line 
 God has always been most faithful 
 And so much more than kind 
 Live your visions and dream your dreams 
 Everywhere you go and all you'll do 
 Just remember you were loved, yeah 
 Oh, remember you are loved 
 And somebody here is always praying for you

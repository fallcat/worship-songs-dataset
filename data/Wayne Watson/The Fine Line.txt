There's a fine line 
 Between contentment and greed 
 Between the things that I want 
 And the things that I need 
 Between "enough is enough" 
 And where desires feed 
 It's a fine line 
 How do I live with so much 
 Here with the spoil of the blessed 
 And not abandon this boat 
 For the sea of excess 
 To aspire to great things 
 Yet be filled with humbleness 
 It's a fine line 
 Oh, yes, it's a fine line 
 So where do I walk 
 Where is my place 
 The straight and the narrow 
 The road of grace 
 Holdin' fast to You 
 Walkin' at Your pace 
 Walkin' on the fine line 
 Walkin' on the fine line 
 Walkin' on the fine line 
 There's a fine line 
 Between taking bread with a lost man 
 And being consumed by his way 
 While reaching out in love 
 Temptation's right at your door 
 Guard what you're thinkin' of 
 It's a fine line 
 When I hide my eyes 
 From the darkest of our life's insanity 
 From the worst of the world's profanity 
 Oh, I've gotta be careful 
 I don't miss anyone in need of me 
 Oh, it's a, it's a fine line 
 Oh, yes, it's a fine line 
 And can I embrace the world's sorrow 
 And not be carried away by life's rain 
 Know the power of the resurrection 
 And still know the fellowship of His pain 
 Not talkin' 'bout walkin' fences 
 No, not talkin' 'bout compromise 
 But living and breathing as pleasing in His eyes 
 In His eyes 
 So where do I walk 
 Where is my place 
 The straight and the narrow 
 The road of grace 
 Holdin' fast to You 
 Walkin' at Your pace 
 Walkin' on the fine line 
 Walkin' on the fine line 
 Walkin' on the fine line 
 On the fine line 
 Oh, walkin' on the fine line 
 Oh... 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... 
 Walkin' on the fine line 
 Ooh...

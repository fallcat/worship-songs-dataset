What should I do with this Jesus 
 Out of control, people screaming "Crucify!" 
 But they can't tell me why 
 What has He done, name His transgression, oh 
 Tell me His crime that He should die 
 Sisters and brothers, caught up in the hunger 
 Mothers and fathers, quick to make claim for the blame 
 Who then is guilty, who's gonna answer? 
 Voices cry out demanding the shame 
 Let the blood, let the blood of the man 
 Be on our hands and on our children 
 Looking for someone to blame, here we stand 
 Let the blood, let the blood of the man 
 The charge for His life ever rest upon us 
 Guilty, here we stand 
 Was there a voice numbered among them? 
 Was there an image that looked like me? 
 Could it be, the cry of abuse, the cold accusation 
 Could change to a prayer, a sinners plea 
 The hope for all the nations for every boy and girl 
 The surety that life is not in vain 
 Just like at Calvary's station 
 The cry heard round the world 
 To cover over us with precious stain 
 Let the blood, let the blood of the man 
 Be on our hands and on our children 
 We're the receivers of grace, here we stand 
 Let the blood, let the blood of the man 
 The fruit of his life ever blessed and holy 
 Spotless, here we stand 
 Let the blood of the man 
 Be on our hands and on our children 
 We're the receivers of grace, here we stand 
 Let the blood, let the blood of the man 
 The fruit of his life ever blessed and holy 
 Spotless, here we stand 
 Let the blood of the man 
 Be on our hands and on our children 
 We're the receivers of grace, here we stand 
 Let the blood, let the blood of the man 
 The fruit of his life ever blessed and holy 
 Spotless, here we stand 
 Here we stand, oh-oh-oh... 
 Let the blood, let the blood of the man 
 The fruit of his life ever blessed and holy 
 Spotless, here we stand

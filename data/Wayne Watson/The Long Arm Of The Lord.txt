A million dark alleys you can hide in 
 Dig a tunnel to the center of the earth 
 Convinced you've got nobody to confide in 
 Got you questioning the sum of what you're worth 
 People label you the black sheep of the family 
 Come collect upon your prodigal reward 
 'Cause you can never outrun or go beyond the reaches 
 Of the long arm of the Lord 
 And I've been ashamed, I've been humbled and forgiven 
 I've been chastened by my Father's loving hand 
 Oh, but still, at times, I go on with my evil 
 It seems to constitute the nature of a man 
 But forgiveness is as close as my confession 
 And my sin amputated by His sword 
 'Cause I can never outrun or go beyond the reaches 
 Of the long arm of the Lord 
 If He gave to me all that I deserve 
 This could be my final breath 
 But with compassion in His eyes, He's drawing me home 
 Into His arms, into His tender arms of rest 
 Into His arms of rest 
 Oh, yeah 
 There are pagans at the corners of creation 
 Making light of the salvation that we know 
 And with a small, narrow mind, I give them over 
 To the passion of the Godless seed they sow 
 But, in truth, they have just as much potential 
 To be Godly and perfected by the Word 
 Oh, 'cause no one in this world can slip beyond the reaches 
 Of the long arm of the Lord 
 No, no, no one in this world can slip beyond the reaches 
 Of the long arm of the Lord 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Reach out! 
 Reach out for the long arm

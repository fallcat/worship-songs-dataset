I took one step away 
 And I thought, hey, what's the harm? 
 Still feel the heat from here 
 Still see the light, still feel the warm 
 What's another step or two 
 That wouldn't be so wrong, would it? 
 Then when I looked for truth 
 My eye for truth was gone 
 And out of desperation, a mercy plea 
 A spell of wisdom just came over me 
 I took the long way home 
 Back to what I believe 
 I took the long way home 
 You were waiting there for me 
 You were always faithful even 
 When my faith was not so strong 
 It's been a long way home 
 You know, I never intended to 
 Get off the track so far 
 The lights that turned my head 
 Are looking quite bizarre 
 It takes so little time 
 For me to be deceived, yeah 
 But just a simple faith 
 Can bring me to my knees 
 But there are some stones better left unturned 
 And some bridges never crossed are better burned 
 I took the long way home 
 Back to what I believe 
 I took the long way home 
 You were waiting there for me 
 You were always faithful even 
 When my faith was not so strong 
 Oh, it's been a long way home 
 Yeah, it's been a long way 
 Oh... 
 I took the long way home 
 Back to what I believe 
 I took the long way home 
 You were waiting there for me 
 You were always faithful even 
 When my faith was not so strong 
 It's been a long way home

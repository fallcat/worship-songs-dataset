On a road so narrow 
 Where all that I can see 
 Is the glory straight ahead 
 That lights the way for me 
 Don't want the wider road 
 As easy as it seems 
 'Cause I know You don't want it 
 Deceiving me 
 Gonna walk the narrow way 
 Hold to the road with a steadfast faith 
 No matter what it takes 
 Not sure what I'm gonna face 
 But I'm gonna walk it anyway 
 I promise to obey 
 In Your Word I will believe 
 I'm gonna let it shine on in me 
 Keep me on the narrow way 
 In Your Word I will believe 
 I'm gonna let it shine on in me 
 Keep me on the narrow way 
 I believe You've got a place 
 In Your Will for me 
 Help me keep my eyes on what I cannot see 
 Teach me to be holy 
 And pleasing in Your sight 
 Help me to know what is wrong 
 And do what's right 
 Gonna walk the narrow way 
 Hold to the road with a steadfast faith 
 No matter what it takes 
 Not sure what I'm gonna face 
 But I'm gonna walk it anyway 
 I promise to obey 
 In Your Word I will believe 
 I'm gonna let it shine on in me 
 Keep me on the narrow way 
 In Your Word I will believe 
 I'm gonna let it shine on in me 
 Keep me on the narrow way 
 With all of my heart and all my soul 
 I will serve You, Lord 
 I wanna take the narrow way 
 Surrounded by Your love 
 I don't want to stray 
 I'm gonna take the narrow way 
 Gonna walk the narrow way 
 And hold to the road with a steadfast faith 
 No matter what it takes 
 Not sure what I'm gonna face 
 But I'm gonna walk it anyway 
 I promise to obey 
 Gonna walk the narrow way 
 And hold to the road with a steadfast faith 
 No matter what it takes 
 I'm not sure what I'm gonna face 
 But I'm gonna walk it anyway 
 I promise to obey

Who on earth could ever explain 
 The great mysteries of life 
 Or the mournful and untimely face of death 
 But as long as we remain 
 We grow better, even stronger 
 Though we'll never be the same 
 'Cause the ones left standing 
 Have to cry all the tears 
 And replay all the memories 
 The good and bad from the years 
 And we shoulder the weight 
 Of the work left to be done 
 And the ones left standing carry on 
 The peace of God will abide 
 In the season of our sorrow 
 In the valley of a pain we can't describe 
 In the palm of His hand 
 Is a shelter from the madness 
 We can never really understand 
 'Cause the ones left standing 
 Have to cry all the tears 
 And replay all the memories 
 The good and bad from the years 
 And we shoulder the weight 
 Of the work left to be done 
 And the ones left standing carry on 
 And in eternity 
 When all the mysteries are gone 
 It will be clear 
 That it was our God keeping us strong 
 'Cause the ones left standing 
 Have to cry all the tears 
 And replay all the memories 
 The good and bad from the years 
 And we shoulder the weight 
 Of the work left to be done 
 And the ones left standing carry on 
 And we shoulder the weight 
 Of the work left to be done 
 And the ones left standing carry on 
 Carry on

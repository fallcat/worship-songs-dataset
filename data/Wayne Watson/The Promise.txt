Here we are what I hope is just the middle 
 Of the promise that we made when we were young 
 And maybe just a little na√Øve 
 Here we go so many thousand nights from our beginning 
 Before we knew the meaning of the word 
 We still believe love is all you need 
 A little wiser now with age 
 A better definition of love 
 And in the end may it be said of us 
 And of this love we share 
 We were tried and true 
 And we danced to the song of our Maker 
 That is my desire this is my prayer 
 Chances are we won't cross the finish line together 
 I want to love you so you'll miss me if I'm gone 
 And this flame will leave a smile upon your face 
 And love you so you can't recall the valleys for the mountains 
 That grace will overwhelm any years 
 That cannot be undone by time and space 
 A little wiser now with age 
 A better definition of love 
 And in the end may it be said of us 
 And of this love we share 
 We were tried and true 
 And we danced to the song of our Maker 
 That is my desire this is my prayer 
 We were tried and true We dance to the song of our Maker 
 That is my desire this is my prayer

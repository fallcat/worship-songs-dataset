I'll be a friend to You 
 Move as the Spirit moves 
 Dance unrestrained with joy 
 Or welcome crying eyes 
 Bless as I have been blessed 
 Hunger for righteousness 
 Love all the things You love 
 And hate what You despise 
 Oh, God, let what breaks Your heart 
 Likewise to me impart 
 Sadness and sympathy 
 Still with hope not too far removed 
 And what brings a smile to You 
 Make my heart lighter too 
 Hate all that You despise 
 And love the things You love 
 And all that brings me pleasure here 
 Please you Lord above 
 Hate all that You despise 
 And love the things You love 
 And all that brings me pleasure here 
 Please you Lord above 
 Hate all that You despise 
 And love the things 
 Love the things You love 
 And love the things 
 Love the things You love

Say, what's your hurry 
 Why are you worryin' 
 About things you can't control 
 What good's it do ya 
 If you run the world 
 And lose your soul 
 Another New Year's Day gone by 
 Still too easily occupied 
 By the urgency 
 Of the generally insignificant 
 By the urgency 
 Of things that don't matter much at all 
 It occurs to me the urgency 
 Can make a strong man crumble and fall 
 It's the urgency 
 Of the generally insignificant 
 That's all 
 Gotta save your passions 
 For things that matter 
 Not for the things that don't 
 Confrontations with the trivial 
 You think you can win, you can't 
 You try to break out, but you can't leave 
 When you add to the web you weave 
 With the urgency 
 Of the generally insignificant, yeah 
 Yeah, with the urgency 
 Of things that don't matter much at all 
 Yeah, it occurs to me the urgency 
 Can make a strong man crumble and fall 
 It's the urgency, yeah 
 Yeah, it's the urgency 
 Of the generally insignificant 
 That's all, that's all 
 Teach your daughters, teach your sons 
 Pray to God, you won't be overcome 
 By the urgency 
 Of the generally insignificant, yeah, yeah 
 By the urgency 
 Of things that don't matter much at all, at all 
 You know, it occurs to me the urgency 
 Can make a strong man crumble and fall 
 It's the urgency 
 Of the generally insignificant 
 That's all 
 It's the urgency, yeah 
 It's the urgency, that's all 
 It's the urgency 
 It's the urgency, that's all 
 It's the urgency, yeah

First, I gave you breath for living 
 Then a will to choose your way 
 Food and water there for the taking 
 Night for rest and light for day 
 It's been some time between the garden 
 And the rush of modern age 
 Still, there's nothing new under heaven 
 Same excuses, just a different page 
 Do you wonder if I'm sleeping 
 Wonder if those prayers got through 
 Do you miss Me, child, when you're running 
 The way that I miss you 
 I created you to honor 
 And to glorify My Name 
 Now your world is filled with distraction 
 Wins and losses, serious games 
 So the fellowship will suffer 
 For a season, for a time 
 In the end, our love for each other 
 Will survive and be refined 
 Come and rest, come out of your weariness 
 Open arms are waiting to hold you, hold you 
 Do you miss Me, child, when you're running 
 The way that I miss you 
 Do you miss Me, child 
 When you're running, running 
 The way, the way that I miss you

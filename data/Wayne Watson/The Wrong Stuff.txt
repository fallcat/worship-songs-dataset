How did you get so far from holiness 
 How did you get so far from true 
 This road will lead you to destruction 
 You're not dreaming up something new 
 Yeah, you live a long, long way from innocence 
 Steady feeding on the low 
 Pouring down from every avenue 
 Everywhere you go 
 You put in cynical and hostile 
 Sensual and crude 
 Hoping holiness will bloom somehow 
 Man, don't be a fool 
 May I just remind you 
 This world is not your friend 
 Maybe you're putting the wrong stuff in 
 Yeah, maybe you're putting the wrong stuff in 
 Just maybe 
 Is it so surprising that we wrestle here 
 But not with flesh and blood 
 The soul's at war with principalities 
 The evil and the good, oh... 
 And he one that tends to get the victory, yeah 
 The stronger part of you and me 
 Will be the side you give attention to 
 The nature that you feed, oh... 
 You put in cynical and hostile 
 Sensual and crude 
 Hoping holiness will bloom somehow 
 Man, don't be a fool 
 May I just remind you 
 This world is not your friend 
 Maybe you're putting the wrong stuff in 
 Yeah, maybe you're putting the wrong stuff in 
 Just maybe 
 This world is not your friend 
 Maybe you're putting the wrong stuff in 
 Maybe, maybe 
 Maybe, maybe 
 Yeah, maybe you're putting the wrong stuff in 
 Maybe, maybe 
 Maybe you're putting the wrong stuff in

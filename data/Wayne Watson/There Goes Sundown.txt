Doomsday, someday 
 But not today so far 
 Said this world wouldn't be here much longer 
 But look around, here we are 
 Only God in His Wisdom 
 Surely not me in mine 
 Knows the number of the days of a man 
 Every day, He shows me a sign 
 There goes sundown 
 There goes sundown 
 There goes sundown again 
 Some days I pray this prayer more than others 
 For my Lord to come 
 When I'm weary of fightin' 
 Yeah, when I'm tired of runnin' 
 Other days I wanna stay around 
 And grow old with that girl of mine 
 Most of the future, it's out of my hands 
 He reminds me every day about this time 
 There goes sundown 
 Yeah, there goes sundown 
 There goes sundown again, ah, yeah 
 There goes sundown 
 Yeah, there goes sundown 
 There goes sundown again 
 I don't believe we've been forgotten 
 God's too faithful, He's too good 
 At keeping all His promises 
 He's gonna come for me 
 Just like He said He would 
 Ah, yeah, He said He would 
 Oh, look yonder 
 Yeah, there goes sundown 
 Yeah, there goes sundown 
 There goes sundown 
 There it goes again 
 There it goes again, yeah 
 There goes sundown 
 Yeah, there goes sundown 
 There goes sundown again

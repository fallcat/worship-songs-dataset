When parents weep, there is a greater love 
 When children lose their way, a greater love 
 When wives cry out and men have lost their dreams 
 There is a greater love 
 There is a greater love 
 There is a greater love 
 When tears pour out, there is a greater love 
 When healing does not come, a greater love 
 When sorrows flow and joy is swept away 
 There is a greater love 
 There is a greater love 
 There is a greater love 
 There is a greater love 
 There is a greater love 
 There is a greater love

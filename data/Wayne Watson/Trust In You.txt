I don't trust my eyes anymore 
 They're easily deceived 
 Too often led astray by things 
 That cannot be believed 
 Smoke and mirrors, slight of hand 
 Make a mockery of the truth 
 I don't trust my eyes anymore 
 But, God, I still trust You 
 I can't believe my ears anymore 
 Even liars whisper sweet 
 Tell you what you want to hear 
 Sweep you off your feet 
 They make you feel so foolish 
 And abused when they are through 
 I can't believe my ears anymore 
 But I still believe in You 
 There is no shadow of change 
 You are always the same 
 Today, tomorrow and yesterday 
 This world is sinking sand 
 You are a rock where I can stand 
 I will not be afraid 
 There is no shadow of change 
 You are always the same 
 Today, tomorrow and yesterday 
 This world is sinking sand 
 You are a rock where I can stand 
 I will not be afraid 
 I don't trust my feelings much 
 They come and go like waves 
 Cozy up to one too much 
 And the others feel betrayed 
 Take a number, wait your turn 
 I'll be with you in a few 
 I don't trust my feelings much 
 But, God, I still trust You 
 Yeah, I still trust You 
 God, I still trust You

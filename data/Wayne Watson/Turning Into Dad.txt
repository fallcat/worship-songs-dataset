I guess I figured he would live forever 
 That I'd always have a place to turn 
 A shoulder I could always lean on 
 And a teacher for those lessons yet unlearned 
 But good fathers too are only mortal 
 Yeah, they long to rest in Jesus' arms 
 They want to walk the golden streets of heaven 
 When the vanities of earth have lost their charm 
 So, I will treasure the high 
 And the finer things within him 
 And I know as he would have it 
 I will lay aside the bad 
 Of all the things 
 That I could still become 
 I could do a whole lot worse 
 Than turning into dad 
 It was early on a springtime morning 
 The small hours of the sixteenth day 
 I was shaken from my fitful sleeping 
 In the not-so-very-merry month of May 
 I cannot explain it, I just knew it in my heart 
 That my hero had breathed his last and said goodbye 
 We are flesh and we are spirit 
 And it's appointed to us 
 Once to really live, and once to die 
 So, I will treasure the high 
 And the finer things within him 
 And I know as he would have it 
 I will lay aside the bad 
 Of all the things 
 That I could still become 
 I could do a whole lot worse 
 Than turning into dad 
 I could do a whole lot worse 
 Than turning into dad

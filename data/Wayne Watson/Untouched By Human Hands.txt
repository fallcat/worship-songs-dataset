The Plague, generation's leprosy 
 Unspeakable shame, untouchable lives 
 Much in need of love 
 But these days who's got much to give 
 Give in to the pressure 
 Cross the street on the other side 
 When Jesus told the listening 
 That those who follow Him 
 Could bear the strike of the serpent 
 Could drink the poison in 
 Was His vision some spectacular scene? 
 Some exhibition, some display? 
 Or a reminder, as I live and breathe 
 To reach out and not be afraid 
 I try to be a Godly man 
 I try to walk in the steps of Jesus 
 I disregard the Lord's command 
 When I walk through my journey 
 Untouched by human hands 
 Untouched by human hands 
 I despise your evil way 
 Have no part in such things 
 From such obvious violations 
 I keep my hands clean 
 But inside this heart of mine 
 Oh, there dwells little good 
 Only the flow of Calvary 
 Only the Lord and His blood 
 God bless the child and lest I forget 
 God save the dying ones 
 Who must live with regret 
 Out on the street 
 Out there where no one can see 
 Oh Lord, stretch forth Your hand 
 And reach them through me, yeah 
 I try to be a Godly man 
 I try to walk in the steps of Jesus 
 I disregard the Lord's command 
 When I walk through my journey 
 Untouched by human hands 
 Untouched by human hands 
 Oh, I try to be a Godly man 
 I try to walk in the steps of Jesus 
 And I'll obey Lord's command 
 I wanna walk through my journey 
 Untouched, no 
 I try to be a Godly man 
 I try to walk in the steps of Jesus 
 And I'll obey Lord's command 
 I wanna walk through my journey 
 Untouched by human hands 
 Untouched by human hands, oh... 
 Untouched by human hands, no 
 I wanna walk through my journey 
 No, no, no 
 Untouched by human hands, no 
 I will obey You 
 I will obey You

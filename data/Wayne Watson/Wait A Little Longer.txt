I know these feelings are new to you 
 I know the mystery and the desire 
 Have you decided what you're gonna do 
 When temptation builds a fire 
 The heat of passion for a moment 
 Oh, it could burn you for a lifetime to come 
 One minute's pleasure might put off your pain 
 But it takes the innocence from the young, oh, yeah 
 Why don't you wait a little longer 
 Be a little stronger 
 Love is patient and I know you're gonna find 
 If you'll wait a little longer 
 And be a little stronger 
 You will cherish the love of God gives you 
 All in good time 
 Your world is filled with fewer do's than don'ts 
 More blacks and whites than grays 
 To learn the difference between need and want 
 Will prove you wise beyond your days 
 It's always easier to do what is wrong 
 Than to hold out and do what's right 
 (Listen) Who said the easy way was always best 
 You gotta hold on with all you might 
 It will be worth the fight 
 For you to wait a little longer 
 Be a little stronger 
 Love is patient and I know you're gonna find 
 If you'll wait a little longer 
 And be a little stronger 
 You will cherish the love of God gives you 
 Oh, you gotta wait 
 Oh, you gotta wait a little longer 
 Be a little stronger 
 Love is patient and I know you're gonna find 
 If you'll wait a little longer 
 And be a little stronger 
 You will cherish the love 
 You will cherish your love 
 Why don't you wait a little longer 
 Be a little stronger 
 Love is patient and I know you're gonna find 
 If you'll just wait a little longer 
 And be a little stronger 
 You will cherish the love of God gives you 
 All in good time 
 Ooh, all in good time

Where are You taking me? 
 Why are we turning here? 
 This road is strange to me 
 This path is not so clear 
 Must be the place where my doubt turns to faith 
 Where I close my eyes and take Your hand 
 I'd rather walk in the dark with Jesus 
 Than to walk in the light on my own 
 I'd rather go through the valley of the shadow with Him 
 Than to dance on the mountains alone 
 I'd rather follow wherever He leads me 
 Than to go where none before me have gone 
 I'd rather walk in the dark with Jesus 
 Than to walk in the light of my own 
 In the light of my own 
 I've made some plans, You know 
 Mapped out a strategy 
 Somebody tell me, where did the seasons go? 
 Have You forgotten me? 
 But I've heard the darkest hour is just before dawn 
 And wherever You are, the sun will shine, shine 
 I'd rather walk in the dark with Jesus 
 Than to walk in the light on my own 
 I'd rather go through the valley of the shadow with Him 
 Than to dance on the mountains alone 
 I'd rather follow wherever He leads me 
 Than to go where none before me have gone 
 I'd rather walk in the dark with Jesus 
 Than to walk in the light 
 Than to walk in the light of my own 
 There will be shadows, but I won't be shaken 
 'Cause You've never forsaken a vow, no, no, no 
 You've never failed me before this I know 
 And, Jesus, You won't fail me 
 You won't fail me now, no, no 
 I'd rather walk in the dark with Jesus 
 Than to walk in the light on my own 
 I'd rather go through the valley of the shadow with Him 
 Than to dance on the mountains alone 
 I'd rather follow wherever He leads me 
 Than to go where none before me have gone 
 I'd rather walk in the dark with Jesus 
 Than to walk in the light of my own, on my own 
 Walk in the light, in the light of my own

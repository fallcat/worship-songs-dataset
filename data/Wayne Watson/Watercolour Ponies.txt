There are watercolor ponies 
 On my refrigerator door 
 And the shape of something 
 I don't really recognize 
 Brushed with careful little fingers 
 And put proudly on display 
 A reminder to us all of how time flies 
 Seems an endless mound of laundry 
 And a stairway laced with toys 
 Gives a blow-by-blow reminder of the war 
 That we fight for their well-being 
 For their greater understanding 
 To impart a holy reverence for the Lord 
 But, baby, what will we do 
 When it comes back to me and you? 
 They look a little less 
 Like little boys every day 
 Oh, the pleasure of watching 
 The children growing 
 Is mixed with a bitter cup 
 Of knowing the watercolor ponies 
 Will one day ride away 
 And the vision can get so narrow 
 As you view through your tiny world 
 And little victories can go by 
 With no applause 
 But in the greater evaluation 
 As they fly from your nest of love 
 May they mount up with wings 
 As eagles for His cause 
 Still I wonder 
 Baby, what will we do 
 When it comes back to me and you? 
 They look a little less 
 Like little boys every day 
 Oh, the pleasure of watching 
 The children growing 
 Is mixed with a bitter cup 
 Of knowing the watercolor ponies 
 Will one day 
 (Ooh, one day) 
 One day ride away 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh...

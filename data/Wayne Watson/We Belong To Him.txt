How can we live in sin 
 Knowing He died to free us 
 From the chains within our soul 
 Let us give the Lord control 
 Of all the things that quickly bind us 
 And walk no longer in darkness 
 We belong to Him 
 We belong to Him 
 Crucified right by His side 
 Bought with a price through one sacrifice 
 We belong to Him 
 Now is the time to understand 
 That sin has no reign on us 
 The power of life in Jesus Christ 
 Has made us free from the ways of death 
 We belong to Him 
 We belong to Him 
 Crucified right by His side 
 Bought with a price through one sacrifice 
 We belong to Him 
 We belong to Him 
 Flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone 
 Born of His blood, His very own 
 We belong to Him 
 At Calvary, God's Son was made an offering 
 The price required, it was paid in full 
 The Word of God was spoken 
 The power of sin was broken 
 God's chosen seed has been redeemed 
 We belong to Him 
 We belong to Him 
 Crucified right by His side 
 Bought with a price through one sacrifice 
 (Oh...) 
 We belong to Him 
 We belong to Him 
 Flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone 
 Born of His blood, His very own 
 We belong to Him 
 Oh, we belong, we belong to Him...

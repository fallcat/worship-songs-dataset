What are you still doin' here loving me 
 Keeping all your promises faithfully 
 If I tried to count the ways 
 It'd be like tryin' to count the stars 
 Who would have dreamed 
 You would still love me 
 After getting to know me 
 Much better than well 
 It took the mercies of Heaven 
 And a covenant love 
 Still sometimes I wonder to myself 
 What are you still doin' here loving me 
 Keeping all your promises faithfully 
 If I tried to count the ways 
 It'd be like tryin' to count the stars 
 What am I still doin' here being true 
 Making up for past mistakes 
 Yeah, I've made a few 
 But try and count the blessings, dear 
 We can't count that far 
 Who were those children on our wedding day 
 We're not those people anymore, wouldn't you say 
 But whatever the future or the turns in the road 
 We're gonna go there together, I know 
 I know, I know 
 Gotta know what are you still doin' here loving me 
 Keeping all your promises, oh, faithfully 
 If I tried to count the ways, count the ways 
 It'd be like tryin' to count the stars, yeah, yeah 
 Oh, what are we still doing here 
 Oh, yeah, those past mistakes 
 Yeah, there've been a few 
 But try and count the blessings, dear 
 We can't count that far 
 Ooh, we can't count that far

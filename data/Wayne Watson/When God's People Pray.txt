Trouble knocking on your window pane 
 Stormy weather at your door 
 And the outlook for the day ahead 
 Like the day before 
 People tell you praying changes things 
 But words don't stop the fear 
 A prayer is only pious rambling 
 Without a Father's ear 
 He will not turn away when His people pray 
 When God's people pray 
 And take the pains of earth 
 To the doors of heaven 
 When God's people pray 
 There is hope reborn 
 There is sin forgiven 
 And miracles you can't explain away 
 When God's people pray 
 Hopeless situation turns around 
 Dilemma passes by and by 
 Look, there's a never-ending field of blue 
 Past your clouded sky 
 He alone can know the need in me 
 Before a single word begins 
 The Holy Spirit intercedes for me 
 I will trust in Him 
 He will not turn away when His people pray 
 When God's people pray 
 And take the pains of earth 
 To the doors of heaven 
 When God's people pray 
 There is hope reborn 
 There is sin forgiven 
 And miracles you can't explain away 
 (When God's people pray) 
 When God's people pray 
 There is hope reborn 
 There is sin forgiven 
 And miracles you cannot explain away 
 When God's people pray 
 Take the pains of earth 
 To the doors of heaven 
 When God's People pray 
 There is hope reborn 
 And sin forgiven 
 And miracles you can't explain away, no 
 No, no, no 
 When God's people pray 
 When God's people pray! 
 There is hope reborn, sin forgiven) 
 There is sin forgiven 
 And miracles you can't explain away, no, no 
 When God's people pray 
 And take the pains of earth 
 To the doors of heaven 
 When God's people pray 
 There is hope reborn 
 There is sin forgiven 
 And miracles you can't explain a way 
 When God's people pray 
 Oh, When God's people pray 
 When God's people pray

Would I know You now 
 If You walked into the room 
 If you stilled the crowd 
 If Your light dispelled the gloom 
 And if I saw Your wounds 
 Touched Your thorn pierced brow 
 I wonder if I'd know You now 
 Would I know You now 
 If You walked into this place 
 Would I cause You shame 
 Would my games be Your disgrace 
 Or would I worship You 
 Fall upon my face 
 I wonder if I'd know You now 
 Or have the images I've painted 
 So distorted who You are 
 That even if the world was looking 
 They could not see You, the real You 
 Have I changed the true reflection 
 To fulfill my own design 
 Making You what I want 
 Not showing You forth divine, divine 
 Would I miss You now 
 If You left and closed the door 
 Would my flesh cry out 
 "I don't need You anymore" 
 Or would I follow You 
 Could I be restored 
 I wonder, I wonder 
 Will I ever learn 
 I wonder, would I know You now

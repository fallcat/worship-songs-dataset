I had this dream and You were in it 
 There was this party and You were there 
 Simple evening with just a few close friends 
 People were pressing for Your attention 
 You were patient, everybody could see 
 But all the time You were lookin' round the room for me 
 But, hey, after all, it's my dream 
 I wanna be the kind of friend that Jesus would call 
 You know if He had a telephone 
 At the end of the day 
 Just to talk about nothin', nothin' 
 Yeah, I wanna be the kind of friend He'd wanna be around 
 You know without a word, without a sound 
 Wouldn't that be somethin', somethin', yeah 
 Is that so hard to imagine 
 The Lord Jesus as a friend like that 
 Spending time in the pleasure of your company 
 True companion like no other 
 Oh, you never had a friend like this 
 If you're havin' a little trouble believing 
 Come on, put yourself in my dream 
 I wanna be the kind of friend that Jesus would call 
 Yeah, if He had a telephone 
 At the end of the day 
 Just to talk about nothin', nothin' 
 Yeah, I wanna be the kind of friend He'd wanna be around 
 You know without a word, without a sound 
 Yeah, wouldn't that be somethin', somethin', yeah 
 (Ooh, ooh-ooh, wouldn't that be somethin') 
 Ooh, yeah 
 (Ooh, ooh-ooh...)

 (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh...)

Yesterday's news said people were dying 
 Down in Africa 
 Burned in the afternoon sun 
 Too little to eat 
 Armies of "saviors" ran to the rescue 
 While the world looked on 
 To help while the cameras were rolling 
 Then sound the retreat 
 Oh, yesterday's news 
 Oh, yesterday's news 
 Yesterday's news said thousands of children 
 Would surely die 
 The refuse of a love gone wrong 
 Love put to the test 
 Angry disciples now have grown silent 
 I, the worst of all 
 My passion for righteousness 
 Joins the children at rest 
 Like yesterday's news 
 Oh, yesterday's news 
 But today under the weight of the world 
 Only so much attention to go 'round 
 And yesterday's tears like morning dew 
 Have burned away 
 But unto the least of these 
 He said "You've done it to Me" 
 Oh, yesterday's news come back 
 Break my heart today 
 Yesterday's news said the King of the Jews 
 Met a cruel fate 
 Nailed to a tree over love 
 That's what I've heard 
 I can't shake that vision 
 Innocence bleeding in my place 
 Oh, yesterday, today and forever 
 Always the same 
 Always the same 
 Yesterday's news 
 Just yesterday 
 Can't stop thinking about 
 Yesterday's news 
 Can't shake that vision of it 
 Can't stop thinking 'bout 
 Yesterday's new, oh... 
 Can't stop yesterday's 
 Going round and round in my head 
 Can't stop thinking about it 
 Can't shake the vision of 
 Yesterday's news, oh... 
 Yesterday's news

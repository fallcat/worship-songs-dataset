You found me in the cold 
 Weeping by the fork in the road 
 I heard the sound of a choir's ode 
 You found me in the cold 
 You found me in the dark 
 Sinking in the shallows of my heart 
 Beneath a ballet of fading stars 
 You found me in the dark 
 You said you'll be the dancer and I'll be the track 
 Let your heartbeat answer the music I make 
 Shed all of your demons in the black of the night 
 Cause even the broken can dance in the light 
 You found me in a broken mirror 
 A reflection of my greatest fears 
 Crippled strings sound tracked my tears 
 You found me in a broken mirror 
 You said you'll be the dancer and I'll be the track 
 Let your heartbeat answer the music I make 
 Shed all of your demons in the black of the night 
 Cause even the broken can dance in the light 
 You said generate sparks to brighten your heart 
 Light comes from dancing in the dark 
 Generate sparks to brighten your heart 
 Light comes from dancing in the dark 
 You said you'll be the dancer and I'll be the track 
 Let your heartbeat answer the music I make 
 Shed all of your demons in the black of the night 
 Cause even the broken can dance in the light 
 You'll be the dancer and I'll be the track 
 Let your heartbeat answer the music I make 
 Shed all of your demons in the black of the night 
 Cause even the broken can dance in the light

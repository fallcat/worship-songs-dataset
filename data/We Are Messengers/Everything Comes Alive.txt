In the morning when my heart is cold 
 You're the heat for my weary soul 
 You're the good in all I know 
 In the mirror all that I see 
 Is Your grace looking back at me 
 I'm not the man that I used to be 
 There's a song, there's a song 
 Rising from my heart 
 Everything comes alive 
 Everything comes alive 
 Everything comes alive 
 In You 
 In the evening when my bones are tired 
 You're my strength and my heart's desire 
 You're the light when the sun expires 
 I remember how far I've come 
 I'm not lost with You I'm home 
 I didn't find You on my own 
 There's a song, there's a song 
 Rising from my heart 
 Everything comes alive 
 Everything comes alive 
 Everything comes alive 
 In You 
 I'm made alive 
 Now I'm by Your side 
 I've come alive 
 I've come alive 
 And when my days are done 
 I've got a Hope that I'm sure of 
 I'll be with You in heavenly places 
 I'll be with You in heavenly places 
 My heart is beating to the rhythm of Your love 
 My feet are running ever faster to Your grace

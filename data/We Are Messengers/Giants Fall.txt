Why do I do what I don't wanna do? 
 Why do I love what I should hate? 
 Why have I sold myself to be a slave? 
 Why do I give my heart away? 
 I'm tired of singing songs of victory 
 When I've been living in defeat 
 I'm done standing with the enemy 
 This is a war won on my knees 
 Who will rescue me? 
 Come wash me clean 
 And set me free 
 'Cause I wanna see these giants fall, giants fall 
 And I wanna crash through every wall, every wall 
 In between you and me give me faith to believe 
 That I'm, I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 Come and set my feet on solid ground 
 Oh shake the fear that's holding me 
 You're the power I need to tear it down 
 You're the only hope I see 
 Who will rescue me? 
 Come wash me clean 
 And set me free 
 'Cause I wanna see these giants fall, giants fall 
 And I wanna crash through every wall, every wall 
 In between you and me give me faith to believe 
 That I'm, I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 My hands are open in surrender 
 I wave my white flag high 
 You alone are my saviour 
 I want more than to survive 
 I wanna see these giants fall, giants fall 
 And I wanna crash through every wall 
 'Cause I wanna see these giants fall, giants fall 
 And I wanna crash through every wall, every wall 
 In between you and me give me faith to believe 
 That I'm, I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 I'm gonna see these giants fall 
 I'm gonna see these giants fall

I give it all to you 
 I give it all to you 
 I'm moving out, as you're breaking in 
 Ready for the fight, I'm gonna let you win 
 It's time for me to wake up, if I wanna be in the shakeup 
 It's time for me to lay down, everything that I hold now 
 It's all in your hands 
 'Cause I give it all, give it all to you 
 Yeah I give it all, 'cause it's all for you 
 And I lay my life down for the only one 
 Could take a prodigal and make a son 
 I give it all, 'cause it's all for you 
 I give it all to you 
 I give it all to you 
 I'm speaking out, as your pouring in 
 Living out this life, from the hope within 
 This time I cannot hold back, if I wanna be on the right track 
 It's time for me to realize, I need to see through your eyes 
 It's all in your hands 
 'Cause I give it all, give it all to you 
 Yeah I give it all, 'cause it's all for you 
 And I lay my life down for the only one 
 Could take a prodigal and make a son 
 I give it all, 'cause it's all for you 
 I give it all to you 
 I give it all to you 
 Make me more than I can be 
 You are everything I need 
 My joy, my joy 
 A reflection of your face 
 Till the glory of your name is 
 My joy, my joy 
 My joy, my joy 
 'Cause I give it all, give it all to you 
 Yeah I give it all, 'cause it's all for you 
 And I lay my life down for the only one 
 Could take a prodigal and make a son 
 I give it all, 'cause it's all for you 
 I give it all to you 
 I give it all to you 
 I give it all to you

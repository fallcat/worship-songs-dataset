I don't have the answers, and maybe that's okay 
 But we can search together, I'm not running away 
 And it's okay to feel, the way that you do 
 And when you reach the end of yourself, I'll be there too 
 When you can't trust, I'll trust for you 
 When you can't move, I'll stay with you 
 You're not alone, it's all I can say 
 I don't have the answers, and maybe that's okay 
 I don't have the answers 
 But I can feel your heartache, I know it's not okay 
 And I know you feel like you're gonna break, but don't pull away 
 And it's okay to feel, the way that you do 
 When you reach the end of yourself, I'll be there too 
 When you can't trust, I'll trust for you 
 When you can't move, I'll stay with you 
 You're not alone, it's all I can say 
 I don't have the answers, and maybe that's okay 
 I don't have the answers

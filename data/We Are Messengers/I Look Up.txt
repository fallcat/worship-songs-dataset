I live my life in the valley 
 It keeps my eyes on you 
 I stay broken in the valley 
 Yeah that's what valley's do 
 If I wanna catch a glimpse of something bigger than me 
 I have to look up and when I look up 
 I see that love is a man hanging on a tree 
 With his heart poured out for me 
 Love is a king watching over me 
 And when I look up 
 He's all I see 
 He's all I see 
 I'm tired of chasing after feelings 
 That are only found on mountaintops 
 'Cause when I'm standing on the top of everything 
 I'm looking down not looking up 
 So if I wanna catch a glimpse of something bigger than me 
 I have to look up 
 And when I look up 
 I see that love is a man hanging on a tree 
 With his heart poured out for me 
 Love is a king watching over me 
 And when I look up 
 He's all I see 
 So when I walk through the valley I will not be afraid 
 I will hold to the promise that you're walking with me 
 God you lead me through waters where I lay down to rest 
 And I look up 
 Yeah when I look up 
 I see that love is a man who was hanging on a tree 
 With his heart Poured out for me 
 I see that love is a king watching over me 
 And when I look up 
 He's all I see 
 Love is a man hanging on a tree 
 With his heart 
 Pouring out for me 
 Love is a king watching over me 
 And when I look up 
 He's all I see 
 When I look up 
 He's all I see 
 When I look up 
 He's all I see 
 He's all I see

We'll be two vagabonds 
 Yeah we'll go marching on 
 To our own song 
 Yeah it's just you and me 
 Just like it used to be 
 When we were both young 
 Hoping the roads long 
 I'll go with you, if you want me to 
 I'll follow your steps, till we find it 
 Right or left until I'm out of breath 
 I'm chasing after all that matters 
 Cause all I want is... 
 Cause all I want is you 
 Yeah we'll share everything 
 Allow ourselves to dream 
 Like we're both young 
 And we'll keep racing on 
 Until the rising sun 
 Singing that old song 
 Yeah it's been so long 
 I'll go with you, if you want me to 
 I'll follow your steps, till we find it 
 Right or left until I'm out of breath 
 I'm chasing after all that matters 
 Cause all I want is... 
 Cause all I want is you 
 I'll go with you, if you want me to 
 I'll follow your steps, till we find it 
 Right or left until I'm out of breath 
 I'm chasing after all that matters 
 Cause all I want is... 
 All I want is... 
 All I want is... 
 I'll go with you, if you want me to 
 I'll follow your steps, till we find it 
 Right or left until I'm out of breath 
 I'm chasing after all that matters 
 Cause all I want is you

I wanna taste more of what is true 
 And live like I've got nothing to prove 
 You're the heart beating right here in my chest 
 The air I breathe not anything less 
 I'm on fire! 
 They can't put it out, can't put it out 
 One desire! 
 They can't shut us down, can't shut us down 
 I wanna love like there's nothing to lose 
 Leave my pride broken and bruised 
 I want a heart that's real and won't relent 
 Won't back down from this fight of this life that were living in 
 I'm on fire! 
 They can't put it out, can't put it out 
 One desire! 
 They can't shut us down, can't shut us down 
 There's nowhere we can run and hide 
 There's nowhere we won't feel the heat of His fire, of His fire 
 There's nowhere we won't shine a light 
 There's no one can't be made alive, by His fire 
 Oh His fire! 
 You're the heart beating right here in my chest 
 The air I breathe not anything less 
 I'm on fire! (I'm on fire!) 
 They can't put it out, can't put it out 
 One desire! (One desire!) 
 They can't shut us down, can't shut us down 
 I'm on fire! (I'm on fire!) 
 They can't put it out, can't put it out (Can't put it out) 
 One desire! (One desire!) 
 They can't shut us down, can't shut us down (Can't shut us down) 
 I'm on fire! (I'm on fire!) 
 I'm on fire! (I'm on fire!) 
 I'm on fire! (I'm on fire!) 
 I'm on fire!

I've been trying to make sense of the sorrow that I feel 
 Holding on for life to the only thing that's real 
 I've only scratched the surface, I've barely had a taste 
 But just a glimpse draws my heart to change 
 And one sight of you lays my sin to waste 
 I don't need to see everything, just more of you 
 Take it all, take it all away 
 Magnify no other name 
 Open up, open up my eyes 
 To you 
 Take it all, take it all away 
 Magnify no other name 
 Open up, open up my eyes 
 To you 
 My sight is incomplete and I've made you look small 
 I've been staring at my problems for way too long 
 Re-align where my hope is set, until you're all that's left 
 But just a glimpse draws my heart to change 
 And one sight of you lays my sin to waste 
 I don't need to see everything, just more of you 
 Take it all, take it all away 
 Magnify no other name 
 Open up, open up my eyes 
 To you 
 Take it all, take it all away 
 Magnify no other name 
 Open up, open up my eyes 
 To you 
 Oh God, be greater, than the worries in my life 
 Be stronger, than the weakness in my mind 
 Be louder, let your Glory come alive 
 Be magnified 
 God be greater, than the worries in my life 
 Be stronger, than the weakness in my mind 
 Be louder, let your Glory come alive 
 Be magnified 
 Be magnified 
 Take it all, take it all away 
 Magnify no other name 
 Open up, open up my eyes 
 To you 
 Take it all, take it all away 
 Magnify no other name 
 Open up, open up my eyes 
 To you, to you

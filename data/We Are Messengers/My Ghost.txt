I've heard whispers in the hallways of my mind 
 They haunt the caverns of my heart 
 And I fight day and night in the warring for my soul 
 I feel You closer in the dark 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 I'd been held under a spell, but I'm not that dead man walking 
 You resurrect the wreckage of my past 
 Nothing can ever take the life you've breathed in me 
 Spirit consuming all I am 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 I'm a new creation 
 The old has passed away 
 You see me as I am 
 My flesh is just a memory 
 And You alone remain 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost, my ghost 
 You're my ghost 
 You're my ghost

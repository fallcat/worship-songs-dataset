How can I forgive when I can't forgive myself 
 How can I move on when all I have is regrets 
 How can I fix you when I keep turning away 
 How can I make it past the noise with my shame 
 I need a miracle 
 Some healing for my heart 
 I need a revelation 
 A brand new start 
 I want simplicity 
 Where I can rest 
 But I need a miracle to put my past to death 
 I know You want my heart 
 My bruises and my scars 
 I'm coming as I am 
 The only way I can 
 I can't forget from where I've come 
 And what my heart's been rescued from 
 Yeah when they ask me who 
 I owe my whole life to 
 I point to You 
 I point to You 
 I want so badly just to finally get well 
 But I don't want a quick fix and emotional self 
 I will be honest with my humanity 
 No I'm not perfect and I don't pretend to be 
 I need a miracle 
 Some healing for my heart 
 I need a revelation 
 A brand new start 
 I want simplicity 
 Where I can rest 
 But I need a miracle to put my past to death 
 I know You want my heart 
 My bruises and my scars 
 I'm coming as I am 
 The only way I can 
 I can't forget from where I've come 
 And what my heart's been rescued from 
 Yeah when they ask me who 
 I owe my whole life to 
 I point to You 
 I point to You 
 People say that I've lost myself 
 I'll say I'm found in You 
 People ask where does my story end 
 I'll say it starts with You 
 I know You want my heart 
 My bruises and my scars 
 I'm coming as I am 
 I know You want my heart 
 My bruises and my scars 
 I'm coming as I am 
 The only way I can 
 I can't forget from where I've come 
 And what my heart's been rescued from 
 Yeah when they ask me who 
 I owe my whole life to 
 I point to You 
 I point to You 
 I point to You 
 I point to You

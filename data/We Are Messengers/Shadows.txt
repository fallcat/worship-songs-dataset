I've been chasing shadows 
 Cheap reflections of Your face 
 Been searching for what matters 
 But all they've done is pull me away 
 My heart is craving more than this 
 I know that you are what I've missed 
 I don't want to chase the shadows 
 Don't want to chase the shadows 
 I want the real thing, not just the feeling 
 I won't settle for less than you 
 I don't want to chase the shadows 
 Don't want to chase the shadows 
 What I thought would fill me 
 Left an emptiness in the end 
 'Cause you're the one and only 
 That colors life through a perfect lens 
 You are all the joy I need 
 You're the only light I see 
 I don't want to chase the shadows 
 Don't want to chase the shadows 
 I want the real thing, not just the feeling 
 I won't settle for less than you 
 I don't want to chase the shadows 
 Don't want to chase the shadows 
 Get me out in the light, where my heart can be true 
 Only you satisfy, only you make me new 
 Through the static and noise I'm reaching for you 
 I'm reaching for you 
 I don't want to chase the shadows (I'm reaching for you) 
 Don't want to chase the shadows (I'm reaching for you) 
 I want the real thing, not just the feeling 
 I won't settle for less than you 
 I don't want to chase the shadows (I'm reaching for you) 
 Don't want to chase the shadows (I'm reaching for you) 
 I don't want to chase the shadows (I'm reaching for you) 
 Don't want to chase the shadows 
 I've been chasing shadows...

I belong to a world 
 Nobody here seems to know 
 I still believe every dream 
 And I never fall asleep alone 
 You couldn't trade your mind for a sip 
 And you wonder why you feel so cold 
 Go on put your feet in the river 
 Let the river come and save your soul 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong to a song 
 Nobody wants me to sing 
 But I don't need to see to believe 
 That this river's headed for the sea 
 I won't trade my soul for the gold 
 Oh the devil's got no hold on me 
 You can put your feet in the river 
 Let the river come and set you free 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 My soul is parched 
 And my lips are dry 
 All I want to taste is 
 The rains from the sky 
 Break through the swell 
 Where the waters are deep 
 Where I can be clean 
 And I can be free 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river 
 I belong, yeah, I belong, yeah 
 I belong to the river

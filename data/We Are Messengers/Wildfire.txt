Find me down here on my knees 
 Who I've been I can't believe 
 I need you 
 Blazing like the fiery sun 
 Come burn all the shameful things I've done 
 I need you 
 You're a wildfire 
 You are the one 
 Who lights up the dark with a furious love 
 Take my ashes and turn them to gold 
 Sweep over me with your furious love 
 Fire up my heart 
 Oh c'mon light me up 
 Steady now you lead me home 
 Into arms that never let me go 
 Stand beside me in the flame 
 Let your light ignite a fire 
 Inside me 
 I feel it rising 
 You're a wildfire 
 You are the one 
 Who lights up the dark with a furious love 
 Take my ashes and turn them to gold 
 Sweep over me with your furious love 
 Fire up my heart 
 Oh c'mon light me up 
 You're a wildfire 
 You are the one 
 Who lights up the dark with a furious love 
 Take my ashes and turn them to gold 
 Sweep over me with your furious love 
 Fire up my heart 
 Oh c'mon light me up 
 You're a wildfire 
 You're a wildfire 
 I need you now 
 Burn my walls down 
 You're a wildfire 
 You are the one 
 Who lights up the dark with a furious love 
 Take my ashes and turn them to gold 
 Sweep over me with your furious love 
 You're a wildfire 
 You are the one 
 Who lights up the dark with a furious love 
 Take my ashes and turn them to gold 
 Sweep over me with your furious love 
 Fire up my heart 
 Oh c'mon light me up 
 You're a wildfire 
 You're a wildfire 
 You're a wildfire 
 You're a wildfire

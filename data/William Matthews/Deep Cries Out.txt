I've got a river of living water 
 A fountain that never will run dry 
 It's open heavens we're releasing 
 And we will never be denied 
 'Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells 
 We're stirring up deep deep waters 
 We're going to dance in the river 
 Dance in the river 
 'Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells 
 We're stirring up deep deep waters 
 We're going to jump in the river 
 Jump in and everybody singing now 
 Deep cries out to deep cries out to 
 Deep cries out to deep cries out to 
 So we cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus 
 We're falling into deeper waters 
 Calling out to You 
 We're walking into deeper waters 
 Going after You

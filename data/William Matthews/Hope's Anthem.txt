He's awakening the hope in me 
 By calling forth my destiny 
 He's breathing life into my soul 
 I will thirst for Him, and Him alone 
 He has come like the rain 
 That showers on the barren plain 
 So my heart and tongue confess 
 Jesus Christ, the hope of man 
 My hope is in You, God 
 I am steadfast, I will not be moved 
 I'm anchored, never shaken 
 All my hope is in You 
 He's bringing hope to the hopeless 
 And giving His heart to the broken 
 And sharing His home with the orphan 
 He is the joy, He is my joy 
 He is the hope of the nations 
 The Father's heart we're embracing 
 He is the song we're declaring 
 He is the joy, He is my joy 
 Why so downcast oh, oh my soul 
 Put your hope in God alone

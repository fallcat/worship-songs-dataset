Come and meet me I am waiting 
 Father hear my one desire 
 Fill my hunger with your presence 
 Let Your glory come abide 
 Love everlasting, come and dwell with me 
 Oh Lord, I just want You more, more 
 I just want You 
 Sweet surrender to Your Spirit 
 Draw me closer to Your heart 
 I am thirsty for Your presence 
 Just to be here where You are 
 I need you, I need you, I need you more than anything 
 I need you, I need you Lord 
 I want you, I want you, I want you more than anything 
 I want you, I want you Lord

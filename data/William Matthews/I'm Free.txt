The Spirit of the Lord's here so there's liberty 
 It's freedom for you, and freedom for me 
 The prison doors are open the captives released 
 We'll tell of your goodness and sing jubilee 
 I'm free to be, I'm free to be who I am 
 I'm free to love the one who came and died for me 
 I'm free to shout I'm free to shout of your great love 
 I'm gonna tell of all you've done, oh yes indeed 
 The chains of injustice, no longer hold me 
 You've given the keys to victory 
 You said it is finished, the battle is won 
 We'll tell of your mercy and how we've overcome

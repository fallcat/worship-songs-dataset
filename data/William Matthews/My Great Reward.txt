Desire of the nations, You have won my heart 
 I will always love You alone 
 Healer of the broken, defender of the weak 
 I'll worship You for all my days 
 Jesus You are my great reward 
 You are the prize worth living for 
 So I'll trade it all to love You more 
 My great reward 
 How glorious Your name, how wonderful Your ways 
 I'm living to adore You alone 
 There's a passion that I've found here 
 Inside Your heart 
 I'm falling more in love with You 
 And I've never seen a lover who is quite like You 
 There's no other, no other 
 And every single moment that I'm with You 
 Is like no other, no other

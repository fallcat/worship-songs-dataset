I waited patiently upon the Lord 
 And He inclined and heard my cry 
 He pulled me up out of the miry clay 
 He set my feet upon a rock 
 He gave me beauty for ashes and 
 Joy for my mourning and 
 Praise for heaviness 
 He put a new song in my mouth 
 And a crown upon my head he gave me 
 Life forevermore 
 You've been so good, so so good to me 
 So good, so so good to me 
 So good, so so good to me, Jesus 
 He picked me up and he turned me around 
 And he placed my feet on the solid ground 
 Hallelujah 
 I've got love, joy, peace, and righteousness 
 In the Holy Spirit 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

The Lord is my Shepherd and I 
 Will not want for anything 
 You will lead me by still waters 
 You restore my soul 
 Though I walk through valleys I will 
 Fear no thing cause you are near 
 You're rod and staff are strong and mighty 
 In troubled times you will hide me 
 Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all my days 
 I will dwell in the house of the Lord forevermore 
 The Lord is my Shepherd and I 
 Will not want for anything 
 You will lead me by still waters 
 You restore my soul 
 In your presence you prepare a 
 Table with my enemies 
 You anoint my head with oil 
 More and more, it overflows 
 You give peace like a river 
 You bring joy to my soul 
 Your love is strong like a mountain 
 You bring joy to my soul

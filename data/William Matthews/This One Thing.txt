My heart and flesh cry out oh living God 
 You're where I want to be 
 This song I sing, this prayer and offering 
 To You beautiful King 
 And all I want is just Your heart 
 Yes, I am living just to see Your glory 
 You're where I want to be 
 You're where I want to be 
 My heart it beats for this one thing 
 I'm so in love with You 
 I'm so in love with You 
 My heart is singing this one thing 
 I long to gaze to see You face to face 
 You're where I want to be 
 From strength to strength 
 We press toward this one thing 
 It's You beautiful King 
 I live for this one thing

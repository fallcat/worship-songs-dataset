You hear us Lord 
 When we lift our voice 
 Here in one accord, Father we ask 
 May your kingdom come 
 And Your will be done 
 Here across this land, Father we stand 
 In your truth declaring 
 We believe, that our nation will be saved 
 That our cities will be free 
 Every promise that you give, God 
 We believe, that your love will never end 
 And your mercy covers sin 
 Every promise that you give, God we believe 
 Come fill our hearts 
 With your steadfast love 
 As we're going forth, Father we ask 
 Send your mighty hand 
 With your power again 
 As we boldly stand, Father we rest 
 In your truth declaring 
 We believe you are Life You are Hope, You are Good 
 We believe what you say, Your promise is True 
 We believe that you Heal You Restore 
 You Forgive You have won every victory

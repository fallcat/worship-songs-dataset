I'm am at my very end 
 I've tried all that seems right 
 I'm coming closer to the beginning 
 Look through the start of our new life 
 Without out stretched arms I'm broken 
 And yet before You come change me 
 This is a sound of desperation 
 I fumble how it's coming clean 
 We cry aloud, afraid of some 
 All we want is the love that was on the cross 
 All we need is Your blood to comfort us 
 All we desire is for You to fill this place 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 Repentance is our desire 
 Come fill our hearts with Your holy fire 
 This is the sound of desperation 
 The cry of Your creation 
 We cry aloud, afraid of some 
 All we want is the love that was on the cross 
 All we need is Your blood to comfort us 
 All we desire is for You to fill this place 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 All we want is the love that was on the cross 
 All we need is Your blood to comfort us 
 All we desire is for You to fill this place 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 All we want is the love that was on the cross 
 All we need is Your blood to comfort us 
 All we desire is for You to fill this place 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 We shout it out, we're free 
 We shout aloud 
 With the everlasting song 
 We join with the angels and cry 
 Holy is the Lord 
 We shout aloud 
 With the everlasting song 
 We join with the angels and cry 
 Holy is the Lord 
 We shout aloud 
 With the everlasting song 
 We join with the angels and cry 
 Holy is the lord 
 We shout aloud 
 With the everlasting son 
 We join with the angels and cry 
 Holy is the lord

You took the weight 
 Of my sin and my failures 
 On Your shoulders 
 Now I'm redeemed 
 From Your love that poured over And over 
 And at Your cross 
 I fall face down 
 At Your feet 
 I lay myself 
 Holding nothing back 
 Here in this time with You 
 With you 
 You gave me life 
 Through Your cross and I offer 
 All of myself 
 Now I am free 
 Through Your love that poured over 
 Death is over 
 If my lungs can't sing 
 I'll sing with my heart 
 With my soul 
 With my mind 
 Yeah, I'll sing it for You 
 I lay face down 
 To show my love 
 I fall face down 
 Lord, make me new again 
 Lord, make me new again 
 Lord, make me new again 
 Lord, I am new again

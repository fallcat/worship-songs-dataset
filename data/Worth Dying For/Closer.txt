I won't let you pass me by 
 Here in this moment 
 Without you I'm empty inside 
 Hopeless without you in my life 
 No distance can keep me from you 
 Forever you found me 
 All my sin has drowned in your grace 
 All of my past has been erased 
 I don't want to walk away from this place 
 Unless I know I've given you all of me 
 Lord draw me closer to you 
 Lord I'm standing at your feet 
 Calling out your name 
 Just to see a glimpse of your holy face 
 Lord draw me closer to you 
 I give up everything to find you 
 My God and my King 
 And this love song I sing 
 To find you, now let your 
 I don't want to walk away from this place 
 I'm captured by the hands of amazing grace 
 Lord hold me closer to you

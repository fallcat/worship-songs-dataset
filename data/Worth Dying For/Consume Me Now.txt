You make my world 
 Collide with Yours 
 Cause that's the only way 
 That I get more of You 
 That I can get more of You 
 I need my life 
 Consumed by your fire 
 When my heart 
 Has one desire 
 To see your face 
 In plain view 
 I'm not satisfied 
 Without more of You 
 More of You... 
 From the depths of my soul 
 I need You... 
 My heart here goes 
 I Love You... oh 
 I lift up my heart 
 And I search 
 Consume me now 
 Consume me... now 
 I need my life 
 Consumed by your fire 
 Where my heart 
 Has one desire 
 To see your face 
 In plain view 
 I am not satisfied 
 Without more of You 
 More of you... 
 From the depths of my soul 
 I need You... 
 My heart it goes... 
 I Love You... oh... 
 I lift up my heart 
 And I search 
 Consume me now 
 Consume me now... 
 Consume me now 
 Oh my soul is Yours 
 All my love is Yours 
 I give it all to You 
 Surrender all to You... 
 All my soul is Yours 
 All my love is Yours 
 I give it all to You 
 Surrender all to You... 
 To You... 
 From the depths of my soul 
 I need You... 
 My heart it goes 
 I Love You... oh... 
 I lift up my heart 
 And I search 
 Consume me now 
 Consume me now... 
 Consume me now 
 Consume me... now

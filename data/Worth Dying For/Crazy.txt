Here I am, hands to the sky 
 I throw them high 
 Overwhelmed by saving grace 
 I sing Your praise 
 Give me all that You have 
 I want all of the world to see 
 The evidence in me 
 I'll go crazy, jump for You 
 I'll go crazy, yell to You 
 The world will try to shut me up but they can't 
 Hold me down I will worship You like crazy 
 Since the pride that's deep inside 
 Take my life 
 Revive my soul, I want You Lord 
 To take control 
 Give me all that You have 
 I want all of the world to see 
 The evidence in me 
 I'll go crazy, jump for You 
 I'll go crazy, yell to You 
 The world will try to shut me up but they can't 
 Hold me down I will worship You like crazy 
 I'll go crazy, jump for You 
 I'll go crazy, yell to You 
 The world will try to shut me up but they can't 
 Hold me down I will worship You like crazy 
 Give me all that You have 
 I want all of the world to see 
 The evidence in me 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go 
 We go crazy, here we go, here we go

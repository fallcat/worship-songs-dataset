Whisper to me, Lord 
 Pour over me, Lord 
 I would give You my life 
 As a sacrifice 
 For You, my savior 
 For You, my savior 
 For You, my savior 
 I wanna stand in this place 
 I know You are here 
 I would die to live for You 
 All I live for is this eternal race 
 As I chase after You 
 Lord, I wanna be with You 
 Take all my sin, Lord, yes 
 You're all that I live for 
 I would give You my life 
 As a sacrifice 
 Oh, I wanna be with You, oh yeah 
 And I die to live 
 For You, my God 
 I die to live 
 For You, my God 
 I wanna stand in this place 
 I know You are here 
 I would die just to live for You 
 And all I live for is this eternal race 
 As I chase after You 
 Lord, I wanna be with You

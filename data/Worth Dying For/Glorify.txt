Here I am 
 Come take my world apart 
 I'm broken now 
 Just leave me to Your heart 
 Take me as I am 
 Take these empty hands 
 Glorify, Glorify 
 The risen Son of God 
 Glorify, Glorify 
 Our Savior Jesus Christ 
 Let me be 
 A reflection of Your life 
 Sing through me 
 A song to lift You high 
 In this world I'll stand 
 Raising holy hands to 
 Glorify, Glorify 
 The risen Son of God 
 Glorify, Glorify 
 Our Savior Jesus Christ 
 Every knee will bow 
 Let me be the first 
 To fall before You now

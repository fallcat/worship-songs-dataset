Jesus Your name 
 Is more than a name 
 It's giving me hope 
 It's giving me life 
 Jesus Your name be lifted high 
 No other name but Jesus is 
 Your name is higher, is higher 
 Your name is high above all 
 Your love is greater, is greater 
 Your name has conquered it all 
 Jesus your life 
 Poured out for all 
 Ransomed my heart 
 And rescued my soul 
 King over all coming again 
 Death could not hold you 
 Forever you reign... You reign 
 Nails couldn't You down 
 The grave couldn't keep You in 
 Hell couldn't keep You out 
 You reign, You reign 
 Whoa... Whoa... 
 Your name is higher

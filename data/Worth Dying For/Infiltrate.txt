I'm a part of the fellowship of the unashamed. 
 I have Holy Spirit power. 
 I've stepped over the line. 
 The decision has been made. 
 I'm a disciple of His. 
 I won't look back, 
 Let up, slow down, 
 Back away, or be still. 
 My past redeemed, 
 My present makes sense, 
 My future is secure. 
 I'm finished and done with low living, 
 Sidewalking, small planning, 
 Smooth-knees, colorless dreams, 
 Tame visions, worldly-talking, 
 Cheap-giving, and dwarf goals. 
 I no longer need pre-eminence, 
 Position, promotion, 
 Applause, or popularity. 
 I don't have to be right, 
 First, tops, recognized, 
 Praised, regarded, or rewarded. 
 I now live by faith, 
 Lean on His presence, walk by patience. 
 I am uplifted by prayer and labour by power. 
 My face is set. 
 My gait is fast. 
 My goal is Heaven. 
 My road is narrow. 
 My way is rough. 
 My companions are few. 
 My God reliable. 
 My mission is clear. 
 I cannot be bought, compromised, 
 Detoured, lured away, 
 Turned back, deluded, or delayed. 
 I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice, 
 Hesitate in the presence of my adversaries, 
 Negotiate at the table of my enemy, 
 Or ponder at the pool of popularity. 
 I won't give up, shut up, let up, 
 Until I've stayed up, stored up, prayed up, 
 Preached up for the cause of Christ. 
 I am a disciple of Jesus. 
 We will fight for You. 
 We will die for You. 
 We will go for You. 
 We will fight for You. 
 We will die for You. 
 We will go for You.

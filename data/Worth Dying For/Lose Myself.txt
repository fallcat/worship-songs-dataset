Let me disappear may You appear 
 Wanting less of me and more of You 
 Giving You all I have inside 
 Abandoning all my own desires 
 Heal my calloused heart and make me new 
 Let me feel Your presence in this room 
 Relinquishing everything inside 
 I'm shedding the layers of my pride 
 To worship You 
 I cannot breathe without You 
 I just can't be without You 
 I am reaching out my hand to You 
 My heart is dying for You 
 My eyes are crying for You 
 I surrender all I am to You 
 Sacrificing what it costs to find You 
 Wanna lose myself in You 
 Wanna lose myself in You 
 Wanna lose myself in You 
 Wanna lose myself in You my Lord 
 Inundated intoxicated consumed in all of You

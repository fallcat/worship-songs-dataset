Our hope now is rising 
 The darkness we're fighting 
 Our voices uniting 
 Love shatters the silence 
 We have been infected 
 Our world is affected 
 You paid for our freedom 
 We fight for Your kingdom 
 Start a riot, for the sake of love 
 Our hearts now beat with the love You gave 
 Our world is changed 'cause You made a way 
 We're breaking free from the enemy 
 We are, we are, the love riot 
 Love Riot 
 Turn the city upside down 
 Love Riot 
 For the name of Jesus 
 With Your love, with Your love, I'm breaking free 
 Now Your love, now Your love, alive in me 
 Can you hear, can you hear the sound of love

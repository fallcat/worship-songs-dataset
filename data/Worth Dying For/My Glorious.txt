The world's shaking with the love of God 
 Great and glorious, let the whole Earth sing 
 And all you ever do is change the old from new 
 People we believe that... 
 God is bigger than the air I breathe 
 The world we'll leave 
 God will save the day and all will say 
 My glorious! 
 Clouds are breaking, heaven's come to earth 
 Hearts awakening let the church bells ring 
 And all you ever do is change the old from new 
 People we believe that... 
 God is bigger than the air I breathe 
 The world we'll leave 
 God will save the day and all will say 
 My glorious! My glorious! My glorious! My glorious! My glorious! 
 God is bigger than the air I breathe 
 The world we'll leave 
 God will save the day and all will say

All I need in this lifetime is You now 
 With every breath I'm getting closer to You 
 I'm never gonna stop reaching out to You 
 All I can do is yell out 
 I wanna feel wanna know wanna touch You 
 I'm trusting You with every step I take 
 I throw my life into Your hands 
 Knowing You have the perfect plan 
 And I'm running to be with You 
 And I'm longing to see Your face 
 I could never let this love die down anymore 
 'Cause You're the only one I'd give my life for 
 I could never give my heart away to anyone 
 I give it all to You my only One 
 More of You, less of me 
 Every part of my life I give away 
 Without You, I'm incomplete 
 I need You desperately 
 We lift our voice, screaming out to this world 
 'Cause all we really want is You now 
 'Cause You're the only One who can save us

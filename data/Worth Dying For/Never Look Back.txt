Hope in Your hands 
 Redemption Your plan 
 You sent Your son 
 To do what I can't 
 Love nailed You down 
 Forever Your crowned 
 You have saved us all 
 We will follow You to the cross 
 Where Your love redeemed the lost 
 You have given endless hope 
 And we will, never look back 
 Never look back, no 
 We'll never look back 
 Empty made whole 
 The broken restored 
 Saved by the son 
 We sing of Your love 
 Let our praise rise 
 And brake through the skies 
 To the holy one 
 It was love that saved us 
 Through Your cross you freed us 
 And by Your grace you have changed us 
 It was love that saved us

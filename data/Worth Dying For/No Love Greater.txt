Fearless one 
 You have overcome 
 God of victory 
 To You creation sings 
 You have broke in 
 Stole my heart 
 So I could break out 
 Free from sin 
 Here it goes 
 Giving all the praise 
 I'll dance and shout 
 No love greater than Yours 
 There's not one love greater than Yours 
 No love greater than Yours Jesus 
 Whoa 
 None compare 
 To Your righteousness 
 Justice in Your hands 
 Darkness cannot stand 
 This is the thing I know 
 I can't deny Your love 
 Nothing can separate me 
 You're irreplaceable

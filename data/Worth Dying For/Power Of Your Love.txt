Amazing love You gave it all 
 You took the place of sin 
 You tore the veil for my wrong 
 No greater love have I known 
 And all will see Your love inside of me 
 And all will see Your love inside of me 
 The power of Your love 
 Has saved me 
 The power of Your love 
 Restored me 
 The power of Your love 
 Never fails me 
 Your love is all I need Jesus 
 Matchless love You rescued me 
 Was bound but now I'm free 
 Once was lost and now I'm home 
 No greater love have I known 
 And all will see Your love inside of me 
 I'll go, I'll show the power of Your love 
 The world will know the power of Your Love 
 Your love is all I need Jesus 
 Your love is all I need Jesus

My feet just won't stop leaving the ground 
 My hands can't help but making a sound 
 My voice screams loud, let them hear us now 
 Let them hear us now, let them hear us now 
 I'm singing, singing out to you 
 With all my heart and I'm going 
 Going after you with all I've got 
 I'm standing in a broken world 
 Living for your cross 
 So stir it up in me, stir it up in me 
 My feet just won't stop leaving the ground 
 My hands can't help but making a sound 
 My voice screams loud, let them hear us now 
 Let them here us now, can you hear us now 
 (Rap) 
 God is the king, understand that. 
 Every day I praise Him, He deserves that. 
 He can take away your pain, give you joy when you meet Him till you'll never wanna go back. 
 He's only everything you wish to be and glorify 
 And that is why we need to go and tell the world about Him. 
 Go and spread the gospel of the living God 
 And save you from destruction, I don't really wanna be another Sodom and Gomorrah, I need Jesus in my life. 
 He's the reason why I write. 
 For His name I'm shining bright - Like a Light-Brite 
 So I give up all of me to be his chosen 
 Everything He used to hold me back is dead and frozen 
 Feet keep jumping off the ground feels broken 
 Yup, He's my God in the world that He has spoken 
 I know your love has set me free 
 So take control and let me be 
 One of your chosen, one of your chosen

You took upon Your shoulders 
 The weight of my failures 
 And You stole my heart from this world 
 And You gave me life, yeah gave me life 
 And every else of my hope 
 I'm throwing in Your hands 
 So take my life and live it 
 For none but You 
 Let my heart trust in you, let my fear fall 
 Let your love carry me through it all 
 And I will hold onto You even through pain 
 Won't You take me away, take me away with You 
 Won't You take me away, take me away 
 Take me away with You

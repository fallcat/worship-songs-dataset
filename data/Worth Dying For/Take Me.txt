Take all of me, I don't want anything left 
 Empty me, I'm broken for Your glory 
 In all, I do praise will be brought to Your name 
 'Cause I love you, I love You Jesus, I love You 
 When I fall, Your arms are there 
 When I fail, You still forgive 
 I'm crying out from inside 
 With all that I am, take me

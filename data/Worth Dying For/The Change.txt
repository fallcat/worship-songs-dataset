A generation who will not live an unholy life 
 Today we make the change 
 A generation who's striving to live 
 God satisfied today, we make the change 
 We raise our hands, we lift You up 
 And all we'll see You in us 
 We'll praise Your name in all we do 
 This is our hearts cry can't live without You 
 Your passion's burning in our soul, we're overwhelmed 
 We've lost control, our life support, the air we breathe 
 Lord You are in me, come touch these lips 
 And cleanse these hands, Lord send Your Spirit to this land 
 Today we shake the chains, today we will make the change 
 A generation whose obsession for You will not die 
 Today we make the change 
 A generation who will not let their lives pass them by 
 Today we make the change 
 We won't go back

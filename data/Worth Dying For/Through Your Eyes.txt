Take the broken parts of me 
 Repair my willing heart 
 I put my faith in the unseen 
 I feel You right beside me 
 Break me down, and take me over 
 I hear You calling my name, I'm broken and changed 
 So I'll let out what's on the inside 
 I'll stand up, and be Your love 
 Just let me see the world through Your eyes 
 A million times I've made mistakes 
 And a million more You've covered me 
 Pushed my walls until they break 
 I feel You right beside me 
 Break me down, and take me over 
 I'm never going back 
 To the way I was

Lord let me see Your face again 
 To feel Your embrace that pulls me in 
 I want to let go of all my fears 
 Leaving my sin and past behind me 
 To move closer to Your holy calling 
 Devoted to You this vow I keep 
 I'll speak of all You've done for me 
 Proclaim Your name above all names (2x) 
 I'm unafraid to lift my hands and sing 
 I'm unafraid to shout aloud Your name 
 Take me Lord I want You more than anything I pray 
 I won't hold back I won't turn back and boldly I will say 
 I am unafraid 
 Lord I believe You bled and died 
 An atonement of sin for all mankind 
 Unafraid to be my sacrifice 
 I'll speak of all You've done for me 
 Proclaim Your name above all names (2x) 
 I'm unafraid to lift my hands and sing 
 I'm unafraid to shout aloud Your name 
 Take me Lord I want You more than anything I pray 
 I won't hold back I won't turn back and boldly I will say 
 I am unafraid 
 I'm unafraid to boldly say You are my God You are the way 
 I'm unafraid to live a life that speaks Your praise (4x) 
 I'm unafraid to lift my hands and sing 
 I'm unafraid to shout aloud Your name 
 Take me Lord I want You more than anything I pray 
 I won't hold back I won't turn back and boldly I will say 
 I am unafraid 
 I'm unafraid to boldly say You are my God You are the way 
 I'm unafraid to live a life that speaks Your praise (2x)

All day I'm living for You 
 Always I'm singing 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 My life, I give it to You 
 My soul, my all, I'm singing 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 All around the world we sing your praise 
 Sacrifice our lives, to lift up your name 
 When your singing out, our hearts cry 
 All around the world we need You 
 United we will stand for You 
 My life, I give it to You 
 My soul, my all, I'm singing 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 I won't back down, or give up this fight 
 All around the world we sing your praise 
 Sacrifice our lives, to lift up your name 
 When your singing out, our hearts cry 
 All around the world we need You 
 United we will stand for You 
 We won't back down, or give up this fight 
 With You our God, we must unite 
 Today we join for the world to see 
 That You have won, the victory 
 Repeat 4 times 
 All around the world we sing your praise 
 Sacrifice our lives, to lift up your name 
 When your singing out, our hearts cry 
 All around the world we need You 
 United we will stand for You 
 For You...

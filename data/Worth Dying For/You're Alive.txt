I found redemption 
 Grace that keeps me here 
 Love that never fails 
 For those who lost their way 
 You are the answer 
 You are my guarantee 
 With mended hearts 
 And opened eyes 
 We'll tell the world 
 That You're alive 
 Darkness trembles 
 When we speak Your name 
 Beginning and the end 
 And the apathy 
 Break the silence 
 Church of God arise 
 With mended hearts 
 And opened eyes 
 We'll tell the world 
 That You're alive 
 We are not forsaken 
 Our things will not be shaken 
 You are the truth that will remain 
 No matter what the world may say

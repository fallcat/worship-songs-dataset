I love you, do you really love me? 
 I cry for you, have you wept with me? 
 I've cared for you 
 How much do you care for me? 
 So you could have me 
 I carried a load of shame 
 So could have my name 
 Have you done what I've asked of you? 
 I asked you to come unto me 
 Give all your cares and burdens to me 
 For I truly love you 
 Somehow I can't get through 
 I have only the best for you 
 But my voice you ignore 
 Have you done what I asked of you? 
 This is my message to you 
 I'm coming back for you

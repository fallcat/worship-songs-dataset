You can't let it get you down 
 No no no no no 
 No no no no no 
 No no oh no no 
 Don't let it get you down 
 Just when everything seems to be going all right 
 Some unexpected news free enter your life 
 Then you ask your self how could this be wondering why 
 I've been there 
 You see your whole world come crashing down 
 All at one time 
 Your bodies weak from all the worrying 
 Your slow as you mind 
 Your walking down that rocky road 
 But things will get better 
 Cause trouble won't last forever 
 You can't let it get you down 
 Not down 
 I come to far to turn around 
 You gotta walk with your up high 
 Believe if you could reach the sky 
 You can't let it get you down 
 Have you ever felt the need to get away from it all 
 The person that you care about the most just broke your heart 
 Just to be in the same room with them 
 You can't stand the thought 
 I've been there 
 You don't know if your relationship is worth holdin' on 
 How much longer can you take being treated so wrong 
 You're confused on what to do 
 But no matter what you do 
 You're gonna make it through 
 Oh, take it from me 
 The only thing you need a little faith 
 The size of a mustard seed 
 You may cry through the night but hold 
 Cause joy comes in the morning 
 In the morning 
 Joy comes in the morning 
 Have a little faith 
 Just a little faith 
 And you can make it 
 So don't you give up 
 Don't you let nobody turn you around 
 Don't you let nobody turn you around 
 Keep your head up to the sky 
 Believe in yourself

I want to start things out by giving testimony 
 Cause one of my friends got ill seriously 
 Now the doctor told him ain't no way you gone' live 
 But he prayed his prayer in faith 
 And a miracle appeared 
 Chorus: Its already all right, Its already all right 
 And all you got to do is Just bow your head down 
 Just bow and pray And then give it all up 
 And know everything's gonna be okay 
 Just throw your hands up 
 And then wave them left to right 
 And now do your dance child 
 Cause its all right already 
 Always surrounded by negativity 
 This might be where I live 
 But it ain't gonna change me 
 Gotta work on my mind 
 And keep my actions pure 
 And when I stumble, I know who has the cure 
 So any time your feeling down 
 Just lift your voice in praise 
 It'll pick you right up 
 And you can come to Him don't be afraid 
 Anytime, day or night He can give you what you need 
 And if you pray your prayer in faith 
 And in your heart believe that 
 When life's problems get you down 
 Can't find no peace nowhere around 
 Trust in the spirit you can't see 
 Its bout to bring you your relief 
 Go ahead and cry now, Its all right 
 Cause now you're cryin tears of joy 
 This life ain't hurting you no more 
 Cause you know its already all right

Although the sun has been around for a long time 
 Still have the ability to shine 
 And although the moon lights up the night 
 Sometimes it likes to hang out in the sunshine 
 Although green grass sometimes turn brown 
 Its refreshed when rain drops come falling down 
 Creations starts and its renewed 
 By a single touch from you 
 So, I depend on you know matter what I do 
 I know that you'll always come though 
 You'll never changed the rules 
 I can depend on the always-ness of you 
 Never change you'll remain 
 Faithful through life's ups and downs still the same 
 Everlasting love for me so heavenly 
 That's the always-ness 
 The seasons change without a calendar 
 And the breezeless knows how and when to blow 
 Never have to wonder where the water goes 
 Cause it flows home to the ocean flow 
 Everything reacting in common sense 
 When placed beneath the of your omnipotent 
 Please want you show how I should live 
 So, glory I can give 
 'Cause I depend on you know matter what I do 
 I know that you'll always come though 
 You'll never changed the rules 
 I can depend on the always-ness of you 
 It's so simple when I do things your way 
 So, I try everyday, but sometimes my path can get hard 
 Even when I start off with the best of intentions 
 I get weak and fall short 
 And I know when I'm down you'll be there to lift me up 
 You love never waited no - no - no - no - no 
 Faithful through life's ups and downs -- So, heavenly your love for me 
 Never; never, never change -- You'll remain; you'll remain 
 Faithful so faithful -- Everlasting love for me 
 The always-ness of God of God

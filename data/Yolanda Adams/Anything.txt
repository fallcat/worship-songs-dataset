How big is your imagination 
 How much do you dream 
 Have you ever had a vision that seems so far to reach 
 But I ain't trying to preach to you 
 But I'm really concerned about the road you choose 
 Where are you going 
 What are you doing 
 What are you choosing 
 Why don't you 
 Let the melody you hear 
 Whisper softly in your ear 
 Telling you, you can do anything if you believe 
 Let the softness of my voice remind you that you got a choice 
 You can achieve anything if you believe 
 Now I know you gotta make your own decisions 
 You gotta make your own mistakes 
 But I'm watching you as you do what you do 
 And I see myself as I watch you cause 
 I did what you're doing when I was a kid 
 And I made the same mistakes 
 I been where you been 
 But you can change your destiny 
 If you listen to the words that I say 
 Vamp: Anything is possible 
 Reachable, attainable 
 If you see your self as God sees you 
 I hope you're listening cause...

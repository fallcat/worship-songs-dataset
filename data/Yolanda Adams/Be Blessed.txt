Too many storms have passed your way 
 And you're all washed out cause it rained on your parade 
 Seems nobody cares about you anyway 
 Now you're living your life like a castaway 
 Searched for strength inside was it all in vain 
 Cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain 
 Don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday 
 'Cause I spoke to God, I called out your name 
 And on your behalf, I just asked if He would be there for you 
 I want you to 
 Be Blessed, Don't live life in distress 
 Just let go, let God, He'll work it out for you 
 I pray that your soul will be blessed 
 Forever in his rest, Cause you deserve his best no less 
 Enter a place where you never have to cry 
 Never have to live a lie, never have to wonder why 
 Never want for nothing you're always satisfied 
 In the peace that his arms will provide 
 He will erase any guilt or shame, any bad habits you've got 
 You won't wanna do 'em again, Yes we all can change, I can testify 
 See I spoke to God, I called out your name 
 And on your behalf, I just asked, If he would be there for you 
 I want you to 
 My prayer for you today, Is that you trust and always obey 
 On this day keep calling (choir) 
 On this day keep calling (solo) 
 He'll keep you from falling (choir) 
 He'll keep you from falling (solo) 
 He'll supply the answers (choir) 
 Yes He will, if you stand in faith and trust Him to make a way out of no way (solo) 
 Be blessed from the bottom of your feet to the crown of your head 
 Your life be blessed 
 Your family be blessed 
 Your finances be blessed 
 Everything about you

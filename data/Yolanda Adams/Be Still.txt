Slow down come closer, listen, it's been a long time 
 Since we gotten together like this 
 And I really miss you, told you you could talk to me 
 But it's easy for you I see, for you to rush and get in a hurry 
 To the angels and to worry, instead I'm coming to leave 
 And remaining in my safety 
 You'd rather do it all yourself 
 But you know you need my help 
 Be still and know, just be still and know 
 Be still, I will never leave your side 
 I will never make you cry 
 You have got to know 
 I already know, oh yeah 
 Because I have to make you thrive 
 I wanna see you thrive 
 Give you hope and piece of mind, you must be still 
 Your best is in my hands, your success is in my plan 
 With tenderness I speak to you, in restfulness I keep you 
 I wash the fears away so doubt can never stay 
 When I stand strong in you, I give you power to bring you back 
 You never take the time out 
 Sit in silence and to find out 
 I've always been right here 
 Waiting for you to come near me 
 Be still and know, just be still and know 
 Be still, I will never leave your side 
 I will never make you cry 
 You have got to know 
 I already know, oh yeah 
 Because I have to make you thrive 
 I wanna see you thrive 
 Give you hope and piece of mind, you must be still 
 So hold, hold on, to my hand 
 And rest in my arms and hear, hear ya 
 Hear the still small voice singing you can make it 
 I'll never let you down so 
 Be still and know, just be still and know 
 Be still and know, I will never leave your side 
 I will never make you cry 
 You have got to know 
 I already know, oh yeah 
 Because I have to make you thrive 
 I wanna see you thrive 
 Give you hope and piece of mind, you must be still 
 Be still and know, just be still and know 
 Be still and know, I will never leave your side 
 I will never make you cry 
 You have got to know 
 I already know, oh yeah 
 Because I have to make you thrive 
 I wanna see you thrive 
 Give you hope and piece of mind, you must be still 
 I will never leave you 
 I will never leave your side

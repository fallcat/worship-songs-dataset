Before I tell them, Lord, please tell me 
 Before I serve them, Lord, please serve me 
 How can I lead where I've not been? 
 How can I show if I don't know? 
 Before I tell them, Lord, please tell me 
 Before I teach them, Lord, please teach me 
 Before I reach out to them, Lord, reach out to me 
 How can I lead where I've not been? 
 How can I show if I don't know? 
 Before I tell them, oh, Lord, tell me 
 Before I tell it my way 
 Sit me down and make me silent 
 And give it to me your way 
 Please don't let the things I do 
 Distract me from hearing a word from you 
 Before I tell them, Lord, tell me 
 Before I serve them, please serve me 
 Before I say one word or sing one word 
 Say it or sing it in me 
 Before I tell them, oh, Lord, tell me 
 Teach me, show me, reach out to me 
 Tell me

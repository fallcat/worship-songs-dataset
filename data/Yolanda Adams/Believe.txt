They said you wouldn't make it so far uh uh 
 And ever since they said it, it's been hard 
 But nevermind the nights you had to cry 
 Cause you have never let it go inside 
 You worked real hard 
 And you know exactly what you want and need 
 So believe and you can never give up 
 You can reach your goals 
 Just talk to your soul and say... 
 I believe I can (I can) 
 I believe I will (I will) 
 I believe I'll go on dreams that are real (know that my dreams are real) 
 I believe I'll stand (Oh yeah) 
 I believe I'll dance 
 I believe I'll grow real soon and (That's why) 
 That is what I do believe 
 Your goals are just a thing in your soul uh uh 
 And you know that your moves will let them show 
 You keep creating pictures in your mind 
 So just believe they will come true in time 
 It will be fine 
 Leave all of your cares and stress behind 
 Just let it go 
 Let the music flow inside 
 Forget all your pain 
 And just start to believe 
 I believe I can (I believe I can oh yeah) 
 I believe I will 
 I believe I'll go on dreams that are real (All of my dreams are real) 
 I believe I'll stand 
 I believe I'll dance (I gotta dance) 
 I believe I'll grow real soon and (ooh) 
 That is what I do believe 
 Whoa oa oa YEA... 
 (Music break) 
 Nevermind what people say 
 Hold your head high and turn away 
 With all our hopes and dreams 
 I will believe 
 Even though it seems it's not for me 
 I won't give up I'll keep it up 
 Look into the sky 
 I will achieve all my needs 
 I will always believe... Ooh 
 I believe I can 
 I believe I will (I can) 
 I believe I know my dreams are real (I got strength) 
 I believe I'll stand (watch me watch me watch me yeah) 
 I believe I'll dance 
 I believe I'll grow real soon and (yes that's why) 
 That is what I do believe (I do believe in me) 
 I believe I can 
 I believe I will (oh yeah) 
 I believe I know my dreams are real 
 I believe I'll stand 
 I believe I'll dance (I gotta dance) 
 I believe I'll grow real soon and 
 That is what I do believe (I do believe! yayeeyay) 
 Delia!

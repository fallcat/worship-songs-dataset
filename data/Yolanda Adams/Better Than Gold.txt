Leader: 
 Sun comes up moon goes down 
 Heaven shine all around 
 It feels my heart and moves my soul 
 Because loving him is better than gold 
 Leader and Chorus: 
 (In his arms) dreams comes true 
 (And in his eyes) the world is new 
 (Diamonds beam) and yes silver glows (It glows) 
 (But loving him is better than gold) 
 He came (my way) when hope was (gone) 
 I never (knew) I could love (so strong) 
 I've walked some lonely roads before 
 (But now I search) no more 
 Cause this feels right I know its real 
 (The deeps truth has been revealed) 
 (All the joy that a heart can hold) 
 Oh yeah, yeah (loving him is better) than gold 
 (Than gold) 5x (better than gold) 
 Leader and Chorus: 
 I've walked some lonely roads before 
 (But now I search no more) 
 (This feels right) I know (it's real) 
 (The deeps truth has been revealed) 
 (He's all I need and all I know) 
 All I know is (loving him is better) than gold 
 (Loving him is better) than gold 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh

Christmas is the day 
 The angels came to say 
 They said be not afraid 
 For born on this day 
 Born to save is Christ The Lord 
 Sheperds watched by night 
 When that angel appeared from on high 
 And said be not afraid for born on this day 
 Born to save is Christ The Lord 
 Christ the Lord 
 Wise men from afar 
 Said they followed the eastern star 
 Followed it to this place 
 For born on this day 
 Born to save is Christ The Lord 
 Born this day 
 Christmas day 
 Born to save the world is Christ the Lord 
 (2X) 
 They said be not afraid 
 For born on this day 
 Born to save is Christ The Lord 
 Christ The Lord 
 He's GOd the Father, God the Son and Holy Spirit 
 Christmas is the day 
 When the angels appeared to say 
 They said be not afraid 
 For born on this day 
 Born to save is Christ The Lord 
 Born this day 
 Christmas day 
 Born to save the world is Christ the Lord 
 (4X) 
 They said be not afraid 
 For born on this day 
 Born to save our lives 
 His name is Jesus Christ 
 He is Emmanuel 
 He is Christ 
 And he is born to save 
 He's Christ the Lord

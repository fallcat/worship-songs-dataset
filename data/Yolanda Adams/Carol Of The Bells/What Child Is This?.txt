Hark! how the bells 
 Sweet silver bells 
 All seem to say, 
 "Throw cares away." 
 Christmas is here 
 Bringing good cheer 
 To young and old 
 Meek and the bold 
 Ding, dong, ding, dong 
 That is their song 
 With joyful ring 
 All caroling 
 One seems to hear 
 Words of good cheer 
 From ev'rywhere 
 Filling the air 
 O how happy are their tones 
 Gaily they ring 
 While people sing 
 Songs of good cheer 
 Christmas is here 
 Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas 
 Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas 
 On, on they send 
 On without end 
 Their joyful tone 
 To ev'ry home 
 Ding, dong, ding, dong. 
 What child is this, who, laid to rest, 
 On Mary's lap is sleeping? 
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, 
 While shepherds watch are keeping? 
 This, this is Christ the King, 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing; 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud, 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 Why lies He in such mean estate 
 Where ox and ass are feeding? 
 Good Christian, fear, for sinners here 
 The silent Word is pleading. 
 This, this is Christ the King, 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing; 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud, 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh, 
 Come, peasant, King, to own Him; 
 The King of kings salvation brings, 
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him. 
 This, this is Christ the King, 
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing; 
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud, 
 The babe, the son of Mary 
 Nails and spear shall pierce Him through 
 The cross be born for me, for you 
 Hail, hail, the Word made flesh 
 The Babe, the Son of Mary 
 Why lies He in such mean estate 
 Where ox and lamb are feeding? 
 Good Christian, fear, for sinners here 
 The silent Word is pleading.

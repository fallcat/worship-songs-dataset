Going as far as I can go 
 Away from here 
 Away from you Jake 
 And the hole you've sunk me into 
 I wish that I could belong here with you 
 And just be 
 But that's not all that I'm about 
 Your life is built on accidents 
 Like meeting me 
 You write everything down in your grocery list 
 People do this 
 Even insects buzz like airplanes 
 Why can't we 
 Fly away? 
 I'm going as far as I can go

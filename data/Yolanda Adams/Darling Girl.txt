A night flight out to D.C. 
 Phone rings with the news 
 My God I'm so excited 
 It's time to look for baby shoes (yes) 
 Everyone says I'm glowing 
 From a heart filled with joy 
 To soon to be showing 
 Is it a girl is it a boy 
 Found out your My Darling Girl 
 Don't you know you change my world 
 You're my little doll so sweet 
 You nearly knock me off my feet 
 You're my little darling child seeing you makes me smile 
 God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me 
 Here's my favorite picture 
 When you were 10 minutes old 
 And we were right there with ya 
 To wrap you up and keep you warm 
 And now that you're a little older 
 I see your personality 
 And every time that I hold ya 
 I'm sure you'll know much more than me 
 Cause your My little Darling Girl 
 Don't you know you change my world 
 You're my little doll so sweet 
 You nearly knock me off my feet 
 You're my little darling child seeing you makes me smile 
 God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me 
 And you were perfect from the first day 
 They getting tired of hearing me say 
 I'm not ashamed to stand up and tell 
 The world that you're my my my baby girl oh 
 Ladadadadada 
 Ladada dada dada dada 
 Hanging tight with your mama 
 Traveling round the globe 
 Telling folks about Jesus 
 And how he came to save their souls 
 Obviously what's important (yeah) 
 Gotta keep teaching you 
 Gotta be your example 
 That shows his life in all I do 
 You are My Darling, Darling Girl 
 Don't you know you change my world 
 You're my little doll so sweet 
 You nearly knock me off my feet 
 You're my little darling child you know I love to see you smile and

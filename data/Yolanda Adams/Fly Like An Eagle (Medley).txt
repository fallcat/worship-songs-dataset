It's almost time... 
 I'm waiting... 
 Almost time... 
 Time keeps on slippin', into the future 
 Time keeps on slippin', into the future 
 I'm gonna fly like an eagle, to the sea 
 Fly like an eagle, let the spirit carry me 
 I'm gonna fly like an eagle, till I'm free 
 On through the revolution 
 Feed the babies who don't have enough to eat 
 Shoe the children with no shoes on their feet 
 House the people livin' in the street 
 Ooh, there's a solution 
 I'm gonna fly like an eagle, to the sea 
 Fly like an eagle, let the spirit carry me 
 I'm gonna fly like an eagle, till I'm free 
 On through the revolution 
 There are times when I would liKe 
 To fly away from here 
 Far this place of hurt and woe 
 And just disappear 
 To that place prepared by my love 
 That is where I'll go 
 Waiting for that great day 'cause I love Him so 
 I love Him so 
 -Sax solo- 
 Time keeps on slippin' 
 Time keeps on slippin' 
 Wold keeps on fightin' 
 Brother keepin' on dyin' 
 Time keeps on slippin' 
 People keep on trippin' 
 World keeps on fightin' 
 But I am delightin' 
 In the fact that I will fly away 
 I'll fly away 
 One day I'm gonna fly away 
 One day I'm gonna fly away...

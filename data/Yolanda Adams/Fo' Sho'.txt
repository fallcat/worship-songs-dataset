 You may see me crying 
 But you won't see me give up 
 I'll just keep on trying 
 Though sometimes it get hard 
 Hard to see my way 
 But I've got you in my life 
 It's makes it all ok 
 Looks comes today 
 When you have treat me this way 
 And I thank you lord for treating me so good 
 There are times when I get scared 
 But I'll know that you'll be there 
 And you'll pull me out of it fo'sho 
 There are times I'm up 
 There are times I'm down 
 There are times I'm smiling 
 There are times I'm frown 
 Sometimes I've done wrong 
 But I still sing my song 
 Even when I'm weak, I know you make me strong

 When to speck out loud

 Others will come and go but 
 You'll be there till the end

Album: Through The Storm 
 Looking over on the horizon 
 Night breaks into dawn 
 I get a little misty eyed 
 Knowing you've gone on 
 I suddenly came to realize 
 Just how much your presence meant to me 
 I also realize that know you're finally free 
 I'll always love you 
 For the special we've shared 
 All the times you let me know 
 Just how much you care for me 
 I'll always love you, you were a 
 Friend that I could totally depend on 
 I love you and you're forever with me 
 The will of the father had to be fulfilled 
 I still feel your sprit, your voice still 
 Gives me chills 
 The anointing is still touching today 
 I wrote this song with a smile with tears of joy 
 Just to say 
 I'll always love you 
 For the special we've shared 
 All the times you let me know 
 Just how much you care for me 
 I'll always love you, you were a 
 Friend that I could totally depend on 
 I love you and you're forever with me 
 We used to cry together, sing together and 
 Laugh together 
 You said it didn't matter because God 
 Would always take care 
 You taught me how to give again 
 When giving seemed to be too hard 
 The benefits of your love 
 Was my reward 
 I, I love you for the special times we shared 
 All the times, you shown me 
 How much you care for me 
 I'll always love you, you were a friend 
 That I could totally depend on 
 I love you, you're forever with me 
 I love you, yeah 
 You're forever with me I love you, oh 
 You're forever with me, I love you you're 
 Forever with me (I could totally depend on you) 
 I love you 
 You're forever with me 
 I love you, I'm gonna miss you, 
 You're forever here with me

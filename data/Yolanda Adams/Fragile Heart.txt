I remember the first time, you laughed with me 
 And I remember the promises, you would never leave my side 
 Now I'm standing with the news of a tragedy 
 Standing here with a fragile heart, mmm 
 You see I never shared a tear 
 I stayed strong for them, oh yes I did 
 When everybody disappears 
 It's was only you that kept me strong 
 And I can't imagine going on 
 Without you in my life, going on with a fragile heart 
 Chorus:When I think about, think about life 
 Lord I think of you 
 I forget about everything else, there's only you lord and I 
 And I can't think about ever giving up 
 Can't give up a fight (no... no..) 
 The only thing that matters Lord, is you 
 I ain't got no time to pretend 
 That I'm not missing you, oh no no no no 
 I know you're in good hands 
 The same hands that hold my heart 
 And I'll cherish every moment we spent 
 As a gift from God above 
 For he takes care of all the fragile hearts 
 Chorus:'Cause when I think about, think about life 
 Lord I think of you, and I 
 Forget about everything else 
 There's only you lord and I 
 I can't think about, ever, ever giving up 
 (A fight) 
 Lord the only thing that matters, when I'm going through 
 Is giving my fragile heart right back to you 
 Bridge:You see my fragile heart's been broken 
 And you're the only one 
 Who can put it all together again 
 So I'm trusting you Lord to see me through 
 Instrumental/Chorus:There's only you and I 
 I can't think about ever giving 
 I can't give up (up a fight) 
 The only thing that matters 
 When I'm going through 
 Is giving my fragile heart right back to you 
 When I think about my life 
 I, I, I, I forget about everything else 
 Only you and I, and I can't think about ever giving up 
 Can't give up, can't give up (fades)

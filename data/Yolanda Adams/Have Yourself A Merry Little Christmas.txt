Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Let your heart be light 
 From now on our troubles 
 Will be out of sight, uh 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas 
 Let your heart be gay 
 From now on your troubles 
 Will be miles away, oh ooh, yes 
 Here we are as in olden days 
 Happy golden days of yore, 
 Faithful friends who are dear to us 
 Gather near to us, once more, 
 So through the years we all will be together 
 If the fates allow 
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, oh 
 So have yourself a merry little Christmas now, 
 Have a wonderful, wonderful merry little Christmas now, yeah 
 Uh huh, yeah 
 'Tis the season to be jolly 
 Have a merry Christmas now 
 So here we are as in olden days 
 Happy golden days of yore, 
 Faithful friends who are dear to us 
 Gather near to us, once more, 
 So through the years we all will be together 
 If the fates allow 
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough, 
 So have yourself a merry little Christmas now, 
 Now, right now, right now, right now, right now 
 Get the tree, get the holly 
 Get the tinsel, get the garland 
 And have a very merry, merry Christmas now 
 Oh, yeah 
 Have the relatives bring over something good to eat 
 Have your best girlfriend make something sweet 
 Have yourself a merry Christmas 
 'Cause I'm sure we'll have a happy one in the morning

Jesus is coming back, Time to make up for all you lack 
 Neither you nor I know the day or the time He'll arrive, he'll arrive 
 There are things that seem Right in your mind 
 Until the time in life When things must change 
 Will you sacrifice a little Of your time to get right 
 Now is the time ... 
 Coming like a thief in the night In the night for your life 
 And He'll catch you off guard 
 If your heart ain't right Don't hesitate 
 The longer that you wait It may be too late 
 And you don't want it to End that way 
 Bridge: Oh (ad lib) Get right, Get right

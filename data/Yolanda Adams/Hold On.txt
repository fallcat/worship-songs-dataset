You've Got dream and 
 You've got goals there's a vision buring down in your soul 
 But hold on 
 There's nothing that you can't do 
 You've gotta be driven, 
 Motivated too 
 Stir up the gift that God has placed in you 
 Hold on 
 The Futures looking bright for you 
 No matter how hard it seem 
 Never give always believe 
 Hold on, hold on to your dreams 
 Though your facing adversities 
 You can still be all you wanna be 
 Hold on, hold on to your dreams 
 Determination is the key 
 In this cold world, if your gonna successed 
 Hold On 
 There's nothing that you can't do 
 Don't be discouraged by the trials you face 
 Cause your beautiful mind would be a terrible thing to waste 
 Hold on Hold on 
 The futures looking bright for you 
 Hold on, be strong (Never let noboby tell you can't make it) 
 Hold your head up high, keep your eyes on the prize 
 (Your dreams are met for you to obtain) 
 And Your labor is not in vain

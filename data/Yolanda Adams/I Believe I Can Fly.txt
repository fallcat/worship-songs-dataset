Verse 1: Be Be Winans 
 I used to think that I could not go on 
 And life was nothing but an awful song 
 But now I know the meaning of true love 
 I'm leaning on the ever lasting arms 
 If I can see it 
 Then I can do it 
 If I just believe it 
 There's nothing to it 
 I believe I can fly 
 I believe I can touch the sky 
 I think about it every night and day 
 Spread my wings and fly away 
 I believe I can soar 
 I see me running through that open door 
 I believe I can fly (x3) 
 Verse 2: Yolanda Adams 
 See I was on the verge of breaking down 
 Sometimes the silence could seem so loud 
 There are miracles in life I must achieve 
 But first it's got to start inside of me 
 'Cause I believe in me, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Yolanda Adams: 
 If I can see it 
 Be Be Winans: 
 Then I can do it 
 Yolanda Adams: 
 If I just believe it 
 Be Be Winans: 
 There's nothing to it, oh

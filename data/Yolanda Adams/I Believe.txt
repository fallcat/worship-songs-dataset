They said you wouldn't make it so far aha 
 And ever since they've said it it's been hard 
 But never mind that night you had to cry 
 Cause you had never let it go inside 
 You worked real hard and you know exactly what you want and need so believe 
 And you can never give up 
 You can reach your goals 
 Just talk to your soul and say 
 I believe I can (I can) 
 I believe I will (oh I will) 
 I believe I know my dreams are real (my dreams are real) 
 I believe I can (oh yeah) 
 I believe I will (oh yeah) 
 I believe I hold it soon man (that's why) 
 That is what I do believe 
 Your goals are just a thing in your soul ah ah 
 And you know that your moves will let them show 
 You keep creating pictures in your mind 
 So just believe that they will come true in time 
 It will be fine leave all of your cares and stress behind 
 Just let it go 
 Let the music flow inside 
 Forget all your pain and just start to believe 
 I believe I can (I believe I can oh yeah} 
 I believe I will 
 I believe I know my dreams are real (all my dreams are real) 
 I believe I'll chant 
 I believe I'll dance 
 I believe I'll grow real soon 
 And that is why I do believe 
 Never mind what people say 
 Hold your head high and turn away 
 With all my hopes and dreams I will believe 
 Even though it seems it's not for me 
 I won't give up, I'll keep it up 
 Looking to the sky 
 I will achieve all my needs 
 All my beliefs 
 I believe I can 
 I believe I will (I can) 
 I believe I know my dreams are real (I got strength) 
 I believe I'll chant 
 I believe I'll dance (I gotta dance) 
 I believe I'll grow real soon 
 And that is why I do believe (in me) 
 I believe I can 
 I believe I will (I can) 
 I believe I know my dreams are real (I got strength) 
 I believe I'll chant 
 I believe I'll dance (I gotta dance) 
 I believe I'll grow real soon 
 And that is why I do believe (in me)

Ooh! Ooh! Talk about it 
 You know life, has its ups and downs 
 (It) Can Turn your pretty face, to an ugly frown 
 Seems that when I face one thing, another one comes 
 Clouding up my vision, but I can feel the sun 
 I believe that I can do this; I know that I can win 
 Just as long as I have his love within 
 I believe that I can make it, I can make it through the night 
 I believe that I can walk on, with my head held high 
 I believe that I am special in every way 
 But in order to have my victory-I gotta believe-Ooh yeah! 
 I have to see myself at the finish line 
 I have to visualize that everything will fall in line 
 I have to visualize the land while riding through the storm 
 I have to trust in my father and open up my heart 
 I know that I can do this I know that I can win 
 Just as long as I have his love within 
 I believe... Oh ooh 
 I believe I can walk on... with my head held high 
 I believe that I am special yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 But in order to have my victory 
 Oh! Heartbreak (I can handle it) 
 And heart pain (I can handle it) 
 Being let down (I can handle it) 
 No one's around (I can handle it) 
 I believe I can (I can handle it) 
 I receive I can (I can handle it) 
 And now I'm walking right into my victory 
 I believe that I can 
 I believe I'll walk on walk on walk on walk on 
 I am special yes I am Oh oh oho ho 
 And in order to have victory (Everybody help me say) 
 Oh I believe... Oh I believe 
 I'm gonna walk on... with my head held high 
 I believe that... there no body like me 
 And in order for me to ...victory I gotta believe yeah

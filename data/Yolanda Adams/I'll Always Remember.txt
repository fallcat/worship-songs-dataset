Lord I hear of showers of blessings 
 Thou art scattering full and free 
 Showers the thirsty souls refreshing 
 Let some drops now fall on me 
 Pass me not oh gentle saviour 
 Sinful though my heart may be 
 I am longing for your favor 
 Whilst thou art blessing 
 Oh lord 
 Come on and bless me 
 Even me lord

 Even me lord 
 Even me 
 Let some drops 
 Let some drops 
 Whilst thou art blessing 
 Oh lord 
 Stop by and bless me 
 Oh stop by lord

 Bless me 
 Protect me 
 Direct me 
 Even me lord 
 I need you 
 To come on down 
 And bless me 
 Sinful though my heart may be 
 I need you to come down 
 And bless me 
 Yes 
 While 
 Whilst thou art blessing 
 While you are in the blessing business today 
 Not tomorrow

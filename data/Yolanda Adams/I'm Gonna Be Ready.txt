I say a prayer every night, whatever I do, I'll get it right 
 With no regret, no guilt or shame this time, no not this time 
 Once I surrender, I won't dare look back, 'cause if I do, I'll get off track 
 Move ahead in faith, and patiently await your answer, what will it be 
 Sight beyond what I see 
 You know what's best for me 
 Prepare my mind, prepare my heart 
 For whatever comes, I'm gone' be ready 
 Strength to pass any test 
 I feel like I'm so blessed 
 With you in control, I can't go wrong 
 'Cause I always know, I'm gonna be ready 
 I was free to do, what I wanted to, lost everything, but I still had you 
 You showed me your grace, now my life's renewed and I thank you, yes... I thank 
 You 
 So I'll tell anyone who'll listen, I'll testify 
 About how good you were to me, when so call friends passed me by 
 The fact that you would show somebody so broke down, so much mercy 
 Sight beyond what I see beyond what I see 
 You know what's best I know you know what's best for me 
 Prepare my mind... prepare my mind and prepare my heart 
 For whatever comes... for whatever comes I'm gonna be ready

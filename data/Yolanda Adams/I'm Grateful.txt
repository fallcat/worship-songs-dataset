I woke up this morning closed in my right mind. counting all the blessings I had in my lifetime. I'm so fourtine to have someone like god heavenly father. When I was having so many problems no one but him could help me solve them he stepped in and he made everything okay and for this I'm so grateful. 
 I'm grateful so thankful to be in the land of the living. I'm grateful, I'm so thankful to be in the land of the living. 
 I don't mind sharing my testimony to anyone who hear it 'cause I'm lead by the spirit and it's possible that something I might say to help along the way.Been through the storm but here I'm still standing on solid ground I keep on landing. that's why I have so much faith in god. for his love I'm grateful 
 Repeat chorus (2x's) 
 Oh yes (yes) I'm grateful (I'm grateful) 
 Oh yes (yes) I'm thankful (I'm thankful) 
 He spared me (that would stand) 
 He gave another chane (another chance) 
 Repeat chorus until fade out

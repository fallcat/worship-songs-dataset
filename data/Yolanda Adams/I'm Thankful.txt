I'm Thankful 
 You're there to pick me up 
 Whenever I fall down 
 And I can't say enough 
 'Bout the things you've done for me 
 Without you in my life 
 I don't know where I'd be 
 Release my heart felt praise 
 Gonna lift my voice and sing 
 Gonna raise my hands up to the sky 
 Use every breath to glorify 
 Your name your work your way 
 'Cause I'm so thankful 
 For life, for health, for strength to live 
 For sharing love and fellowship 
 For every blessing that you give 
 I'm thankful 
 You're the brightest star 
 The universe has seen 
 And I'm so privileged 
 That you shine your light on me 
 So powerful so great 
 The ultimate creator 
 You gave the gift that we know as eternity 
 What's happenin' around me 
 Ain't gonna change what I believe 
 I believe you sent the Holy Spirit to guide me 
 With knowledge and wisdom for all situations 
 'Cause it ain't always, ain't good for ya no, no 
 It ain't good, it ain't good, it ain't good 
 It ain't good all the time 
 No, no 
 But I'm thankful for everything 
 You've done for me 
 Everything you've given me 
 I am thankful, Oh 
 I am thankful, ooh 
 I am thankful, ooh 
 I am thankful 
 (Rap) 
 Raise my hands up to the sky 
 Use every breath to glorify 
 Your name, your work, your way 
 'Cause I'm so Thankful 
 For life, for health, for strength to live 
 For sharing love and fellowship 
 For every blessing that you give 
 I'm thankful 
 Chorus (to end)

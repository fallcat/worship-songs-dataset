I've got, got the victory 
 I've got the sweet sweet victory in Jesus, 
 Yes I do! 
 He is our mighty conqueror, 
 In Him I will trust, all my battles He'll fight. 
 I've got, got the victory 
 I've got the sweet sweet victory in Jesus. 
 For me He died but He rose on the third day 
 That's why I have true victory everyday! 
 Truly I've been through the storm and rain. 
 I know everything about heartache and pain. 
 God carried me through it all 
 Without His protection I'd surely fall. 
 I've been broke without a dime to my name. 
 But all my bills got paid because I called on Jesus? name. 
 You can't tell me that God isn't real 'cause I've got the victory and that's why I'm still here. 
 I'm not worried about material and things I don't have 
 I'm just blessed 'cause I'm sure I'm in my Savior's care 
 Because I know that my blessing is on the way 
 I can't see it right now but I stand by faith. 
 I've fought many, many battles in His name 
 I've held up the blood-stained banner and proclaimed 
 That Jesus is the truth and the light: 
 Believe me when I say He will make it right! 
 Yeah I got the victory yeah 
 I got the victory yeah yeah yeah 
 (And if you have the victory sing it with me) 
 Yeah I got the victory yeah I got the victory 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 (I've got the victory Sing it with me) 
 (Chorus out)

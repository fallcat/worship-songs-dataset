Remember 
 If we could remember 
 The moment of our birth 
 We give our voice 
 To songs and whispers 
 And know what life is worth 
 Remember, remember 
 Suddenly there's beauty 
 In peace there's all the past 
 And sorrow clings to angry questions 
 The days of dust at last 
 And morning holds us 
 When worlds come tumbling down 
 A dance of ghosts and ragged dreams 
 Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round 
 I remember, remember 
 If we could remember 
 The power of the light 
 That cripple prayers 
 Are sometimes answered 
 And hope survives the night. 
 And hope survives the night. 
 I remember, I remember, remember

I've come through many hard trials 
 Though temptations on every hand 
 Though Satan's tried to stop me 
 And to place my feet on sinking sand 
 Through the pain and all of my sorrows 
 Through the tears and all my fears 
 The lord was there to keep me 
 For he's kept me in the midst of it all 
 Not because I've been so faithful 
 Not because I've always obeyed 
 No it's not because I trusted him 
 To be with me all of the way 
 But it's because he loves me so dearly 
 He was there to answer my calls 
 He was there always to protect me 
 For he's kept me in the midst of it all 
 I've come through many hard trials 
 Though temptations on every hand 
 Though Satan's tried to stop me 
 And to place my feet on sinking sand 
 But Jesus loves me dearly 
 He was there to answer my calls 
 There always to protect me 
 For he's kept me in the midst of it all... 
 No he's never left me 
 And he's never let me fall 
 Oh yes he will protect you 
 For he's kept me in the midst of it all...(2x) 
 Yes he's kept me

 In the midst of it all yeah yesss (2x)

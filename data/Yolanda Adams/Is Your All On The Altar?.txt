You have longed for sweet peace 
 And for favour to increase 
 U have earnestly, so fervently, oh oh you really prayed 
 Oh yes you have 
 But you cannot find rest 
 Nor be perfectly blessed 
 Until all on the alter, until it's laid 
 Is your all on the alter of sacrifice? 
 Is it laid? 
 Your heart does the Spirit control? 
 Now, you can only, you can only be blessed 
 And have peace and sweet rest 
 After you have yielded unto the Lord 
 Your body and your soul 
 Is your all on the alter of sacrifice? 
 Of sacrifice laid? 
 Your heart does the Spirit control? 
 Now, u can only, only, only be blessed 
 And have peace and sweet rest 
 After you have yielded Him 
 Yielded Him your body and your soul 
 That's all He wants: 
 Everything, everything, everything 
 So would you walk with the Lord 
 In the beauty of His light? 
 Would you obey His Word 
 Everyday and every night? 
 We will never know just what 
 The Lord has to bestow upon his children 
 Until we give Him complete control 
 Give Him your, your heart and your mind 
 Give Him your spirit, your soul 
 Give Him your thoughts, give Him your ways, your desires 
 Just give Him your body and your soul

It came upon the midnight clear, 
 That glorious song of old, 
 From angels bending near the earth, 
 To touch their harps of gold: 
 "Peace on the earth, good will to men, 
 From heaven's all gracious King." 
 The world in solemn stillness lay, 
 To hear the angels sing. 
 Still through the cloven skies they come 
 With peaceful wings unfurled, 
 And still their heavenly music floats 
 O'er all the weary world; 
 Above its sad and lowly plains 
 They bend on hovering wing, 
 And ever o'er its Babel sounds 
 The blessed angels sing. 
 And ye, beneath life's crushing load, 
 Whose forms are bending low, 
 Who toil along the climbing way 
 With painful steps and slow, 
 Look now! for glad and golden hours 
 Come swiftly on the wing: 
 O rest beside the weary road, 
 And hear the angels sing! 
 For lo! the days are hastening on, 
 By prophet bards foretold, 
 When with the ever circling years 
 Comes round the age of gold; 
 When peace shall over all the earth 
 Its ancient splendors fling, 
 And the whole world send back the song 
 Which now the angels sing. 
 For lo! the days are hastening on, 
 By prophet seen of old, 
 When with the ever circling years 
 Shall come the time foretold 
 When peace shall over all the earth 
 Its ancient splendors fling, 
 And the whole world send back the song 
 Which now the angels sing.

Joy to the world! the Lord is come: 
 Let earth receive her King; 
 Let every heart prepare Him room, 
 And heaven and nature sing, 
 And heaven and nature sing, 
 And heaven, and heaven and nature sing. 
 Joy to the world! the Savior reigns: 
 Let men their songs employ; 
 While fields and floods, rocks hills, and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy, 
 Repeat the sounding joy, 
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy. 
 No more let sins and sorrows grow, 
 Nor thorns infest the ground; 
 He comes to make His blessings flow 
 Far as the curse is found, 
 Far as the curse is found, 
 Far as, far as the curse is found. 
 He rules the world with truth and grace, 
 And makes the nations prove 
 The glories of His righteousness, 
 And wonders of His love, 
 And wonders of His love, 
 And wonders, wonders of His love. 
 Joy to the world, the Savior reigns: 
 Let saints, their songs employ; 
 While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy, 
 Repeat the sounding joy, 
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy. 
 Joy to the world! the Savior reigns: 
 Let all their songs employ; 
 While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains 
 Repeat the sounding joy, 
 Repeat the sounding joy, 
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy. 
 Angels we have heard on high 
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains, 
 And the mountains in reply 
 Echoing their joyous strains. 
 Gloria, in excelsis Deo,

 Why your joyous strains prolong? 
 What the gladsome tidings be 
 Which inspire your heavenly song?

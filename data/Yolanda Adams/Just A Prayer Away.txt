I know that there are times in you life 
 When the wheels just seem to turn, 
 And uncerntanties about your tomorrow seem to grow. 
 One thing you should remember 
 And you should always know 
 Out of everyone who loves you, 
 I love you the most. 
 I am just a prayer away, 
 Call my name with your heart 
 And I'll hear every word you say. 
 When you cry at night, 
 I'll wipe the tears away, 
 Just pray my love, 
 And I'll be there right away. 
 You will never have to wonder about my love, 
 Just put your faith and trust in my care. 
 I will always be there to hold you in my arms, 
 When you're afraid don't worry, 
 I'll protect you from the storm. 
 Out of everyone who loves you, 
 I love you the most. 
 I am just a prayer away, 
 Call my name with your heart 
 And I'll hear. 
 I am just a prayer away, 
 Call my name with your heart 
 And I'll hear 
 I am just a prayer away, 
 Call my name with your heart 
 And I'll hear every word you say. 
 When you cry at night, 
 I'll wipe the tears away, 
 Just pray my love, 
 And I'll be there right away.

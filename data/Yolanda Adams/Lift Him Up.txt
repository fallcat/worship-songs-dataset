Oh Lord, Oh Lord we lift you ooh we lift you up yeah yeah yeah 
 Raise my voice in testimony 
 'Cause he's more than a friend to me 
 Gave my heart 'cause I believe he's the almighty 
 I can look at my life and see all the things that He's done to set me free protecting me from harm 
 Raise my hands to show how I feel 
 His presence is oh so real 
 Till he's guiding me I'll be still 
 'Cause I'd be lost without him 
 My heart and soul I dedicate and to show I appreciate his love 
 I'll give him praise 
 Lift Him up 
 Each and everyday we celebrate our faith 
 (Lift Him Up) 
 In a song of praise thanking him for everything (Lift Him up) 
 Devotion I express because I know I'm blessed (Lift Him up) 
 Praise Him with every breath 
 Glorify His name, Lift Him up 
 Use the temple He gave us 
 Do a joyful dance of worship 
 'Cause His mercy is so precious and new every morning 
 Always let Him know that we're grateful for another chance to say thank you 
 'Round the world sing it louder, for our heavenly father 
 To his almighty power 
 Let's glorify him, magnify him 
 You created the earth and the heavens above 
 And for our salvation you gave your own son 
 So we humble ourselves to your infinite power 
 Your love is greater than mine 
 (Your grace) and your grace is amazing 
 And through us we lift your holy name

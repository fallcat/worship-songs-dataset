 I want them to know that You're inside of me 
 When they see me on the stage 
 I want them to know the change You made 
 I wanna be now, I wanna be just like You Lord 
 I wanna touch them, I want to heal them 
 I want to give them whatever they need, Lord

 Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be 
 Wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be

Lord I thank you for this day 
 That was not promised to me 
 Lord I thank you for my health and strength 
 And saving me one day 
 When I think about the things I want 
 Not the things God knows I really need 
 There are miracles and blessings for me 
 We complain about our shoes 
 When some people don't have no feet 
 We complain about no money 
 But still the Lord does feed 
 For when I think about the things I want 
 Not the things God knows I really need 
 There are miracles and blessings for me 
 We need to trust God more and learn to love him more 
 And believe and keep the faith in what we cannot see 
 For when I think about the things I want 
 Not the things God knows I really need 
 There are miracles and blessings for me 
 We need to trust God more and learn to love him more (Jesus) 
 And believe and keep the faith in what we cannot see 
 For when I think about the things I want 
 Not the things God know I really need 
 There are miracles and many blessings 
 There are miracles and so many blessings 
 There are miracles many miracles many miracles 
 Many miracles many miracles and blessings 
 There are miracles and blessings for me

Take away any desire in me that hurts You 
 Take away anything that stands between You and me 
 I want to be what You created me to be 
 It's my desire that You find favor in me 
 Lord, take away anything that displeases You 
 Take away any evil thought within me 
 Take away anything that proves to break Your heart 
 I want to be in sweet communion with You 
 It's my desire to do everything You want me to do 
 Lord, take away anything that displeases You 
 Remove all doubt, all insecurity 
 Erase all hate, all iniquity 
 Discard all the fear found deep within me 
 Lord, take away anything that displeases You 
 Take away Lord 
 Take away 
 Take away any desire in me that hurts You 
 Take it away

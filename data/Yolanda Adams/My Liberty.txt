I want to see the blessed face 
 Of Him who died for me 
 Sacrificed his life for my liberty 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I want, I want to see the blessed face 
 Of Him who died for me 
 Sacrificed his life for my liberty 
 He saved my life 
 (Before I ever new it) 
 He paid the price 
 (He didn't have to do it) 
 And I know 
 (I never can repay him) 
 But all my life 
 (I will every praise His Name) 
 I will praise His name 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I want to see the blessed face 
 Of Him who died for me 
 Sacrificed his life for my liberty 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

 And I know 
 (I never can repay him) 
 But all my life 
 (I will every praise His Name) 
 Don't you know, He picked me up? 
 (And turned me all around) 
 And in His love 
 (I am ever found) 
 Don't you know, He gave me joy? 
 (And took away my sorrow) 
 And He is my hope 
 (For my tomorrow) 
 Don't you know that he is? 
 (The joy of my salvation) 
 And I have, I have, I have 
 (A new determination) 
 How could he love me so 
 I think, I'll never know why He

Visions that can change the world 
 Trapped inside an ordinary girl 
 She looks just like me 
 Too afraid to dream out loud 
 And though it's set for your idea 
 It won't make sense to everybody 
 You need courage now 
 If you're going to persevere 
 To fulfill your divine purpose 
 You've gotta answer when you're called 
 So don't be afraid to face the world 
 Against all odds 
 Keep the dream alive don't let it die, if something deep inside 
 Keeps inspiring you to try, don't stop 
 And never give up; don't ever give up on you 
 Don't give up 
 Every victory comes in time 
 Work today to change tomorrow 
 It gets easier 
 Who's to say that you can't fly? 
 Every step you take you get 
 Closer to your destination 
 You can feel it now 
 Don't you know you're almost there? 
 To fulfill your divine purpose (ooh ooh yeah yeah) 
 You've gotta' answer when you're called 
 So don't be afraid to face the world 
 Against all odds 
 Keep the dream alive don't let it die, if something deep inside 
 Keeps inspiring you to try, don't stop 
 And never give up; don't ever give up on you... 
 Sometimes life can place a stumbling block in your way 
 But you've gotta keep the faith 
 Bring what's deep inside your heart 
 To the light 
 And never give up 
 Don't ever give up on you, 
 Don't give up 
 Who holds the pieces to complete the puzzle? 
 The answer that can solve a mystery 
 The key that can unlock your understanding 
 It's all inside of you 
 You have everything you need 
 Oh so, keep the dream alive don't let it die 
 If something deep inside keeps inspiring you to try

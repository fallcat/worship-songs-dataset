O holy night, the stars are brightly shining 
 It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
 Long lay the world, in sin and error pining 
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth 
 A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morning 
 Fall on your knees 
 O hear, hear the angel voices 
 O night divine 
 O night when Christ was born 
 Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming, 
 With glowing hearts by His cradle to stand. 
 O Holy night 
 So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming, 
 Here came the wise men from Orient land. 
 A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices 
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morning 
 Fall on your knees 
 O hear, the angel voices 
 Hear them singing, hear them sing 
 O night, o night 
 This holy night God gave His Son 
 This holy night God gave His love 
 And the angels up above said don't be afraid 
 For born to you this night is a Savior, so don't be afraid 
 Fall on your knees 
 O hear, hear the angel voices 
 O night divine 
 O night when Christ was born 
 O night when Christ was born 
 O holy night

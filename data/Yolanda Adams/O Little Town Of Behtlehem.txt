O little town of Bethlehem 
 How still we see thee lie 
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep 
 The silent stars go by 
 Yet in the dark streets shineth 
 The everlasting light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years 
 Are met in thee tonight 
 O Bethlehem 
 Little town Bethlehem 
 For Christ is born of Mary 
 And gathered all above 
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep 
 Their watch of wondering love 
 O morning stars together 
 Proclaim thy holy birth 
 And praises sing to God, the King 
 And peace to men on earth 
 On earth, peace on earth to all men 
 Bethlehem, you bring peace to all men 
 For this day is born the King 
 In Bethlehem 
 O Bethlehem 
 Little town of Bethlehem 
 O Bethlehem, little town of Bethlehem 
 Silently, wondrously 
 You speak peace to all men 
 Silently, wondrously 
 You speak peace to all men 
 Bethlehem, Bethlehem, Bethlehem 
 They will know of your fame 
 For your name will be synonymous 
 With the birth of the King 
 O Bethlehem, Bethlehem 
 Bethlehem, Bethlehem 
 Bethlehem, Bethlehem 
 God, He loves you 
 Bethlehem, for this day is born unto 
 O Bethlehem

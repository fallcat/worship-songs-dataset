Choices that we make in life 
 May take us far 
 Chances that we take tonight 
 May lead us into darken places 
 But at the end of Godly choices 
 Are higher dreams 
 But in the game of chance 
 There's only a guilty wave or stream 
 Sometimes I don't know which road I should take 
 Sometimes I don't know which move I should make 
 But it's only if God says yes 
 I'll make my move 
 And it's only if God says yes 
 Then I will choose 
 For it's only if God would just 
 Bow his head 
 Then I will do it 
 That's what I will do 
 I started down the right road 
 Only to end up wrong 
 The endless journey carried me so far away 
 From my home and family 
 But I'm learning I was never meant to go alone 
 Neither was it meant for me to go on my own no 
 Sometimes I don't know which road I should take 
 Sometimes I don't know which move I should make 
 I'll never go on my own 
 I'll never go all alone 
 Sometimes I don't know which road I should take 
 Sometimes I don't know which move I should make 
 But it's only if God says yes 
 I'll make my move 
 For it's only if God says yes 
 Then I will choose 
 For it's only if God would just answer me 
 And it's only if God would just hear my plead 
 And it's only if God would just bow his head 
 Then I will do it 
 That's what I will do 
 That's what I will do

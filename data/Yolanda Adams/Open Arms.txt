Quietly He speaks to me, gently He leads me 
 Lovingly the Shepherd carries me 
 He carries me hidden safely in His bosom 
 I feel His love inside when other times, my friend, I couldn't 
 He knows just what's best for me 
 The Good Shepherd knows, He knows just what I need 
 Quietly He speaks, gently the Master leads 
 So lovingly He carries me to a safe place of rest 
 And I feel the Master's unconditional love 
 Everlasting love ever so deeply inside of me 
 I'm so glad Jesus knows just what's best for me 
 The Good Shepherd knows 
 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil, for Jesus is with me 
 He leads me, He guides me, He hides me 
 In the shelter of His arms He holds me there 
 The Good Shepherd knows just what I need

Alone in a room 
 It's just me and you 
 I feel so lost 
 'Cause I don't know what to do 
 Now what if choose the wrong thing to do 
 I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you 
 So I need to talk to you 
 And ask you for your guidance 
 Especially today 
 When my life is so cloudy 
 Guide me until I'm sure 
 I open up my heart 
 My hopes and dreams 
 Are fading fast 
 I'm all burned out 
 And I don't think my strenghts gonna last 
 So I'm crying out 
 Crying out to you 
 Lord I know that you're the only one 
 Who is able to pull me through 
 So I need to talk to you 
 And ask you for your guidance 
 Especially today 
 When my life is so cloudy 
 Guide me until I'm sure 
 I open up my heart 
 So show me how 
 To do things your way 
 Don't let me make the same mistakes 
 Over and over again 
 Your will be done 
 And I'll be the one 
 To make sure the it's carried out 
 And in me, I don't want any doubt 
 That's why... 
 I need to talk to you 
 And ask you for your guidance 
 Especially today 
 When my life is a little bit cloudy 
 Guide me until I'm sure 
 I open up my heart 
 All I need to do 
 Is hear a single word from you 
 I open up my heart 
 Just one word could make 
 A difference in what I do Lord 
 I open my heart to you 
 You're the lover of my soul 
 Captain of my sea 
 I need a word from you 
 That's why I open up my heart

 Jeremiah 10: 23,24 
 "We will know oh Lord that to Earthly men his way does not belong 
 It does not belong to man who must walk even to direct his step 
 Correct me oh Jehovah however with judgment not in anger 
 That you may not reduce us to nothing" 
 Order my steps, lead me, guide me everyday 
 Send your anointing father 
 I pray order my steps in the world 
 (Layzie Bone) 
 Why am I payin' this price for fame now with the shame 
 I'm goin' blame 'cause I'm solo empty 
 When I can stop and give it all to Christ 
 Cause in his name no weapon should be formed against me 
 Simply know that the world gon' tempt me Satan is the enemy 
 God please help us I don't want to be selfish 
 I don't want to live my life tryin' to be rebellious 
 (Wish Bone) 
 Who be checkin' when ya know ya doin' wrong huh? 
 Got your steps, give your blessings 
 Know right from wrong turn the lights on 
 All ya gotta do is follow faith till they call us all home 
 But it's so hard temptation is everywhere 
 Gotta hold my guard like oh my God 
 (Krayzie Bone) 
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, now I might not make it to Heaven 
 But I'm tryin' to come back in the resurrection change my place in paradise 
 So I pray to God try to change my life 
 But temptation make it hard for me to make it out 
 Man I gotta cool out, still I need to stop smokin' 
 I need God's guidance without it I'm hopeless 
 Lord please help me stand strong 
 (Layzie Bone) 
 A lot of soldiers in the pin ain't ever comin' home 
 Can you find it in your heart to pray 
 So it seems everything goin' wrong 
 And you're just tryin' to find your way 
 Momma just wanna feed her babies 
 Tryin' to keep a safe place to stay 
 Don't stress it's a test God Bless all ya 
 Really gotta do is just keep your faith 
 (Wish Bone) 
 You can feel it if you open up, you can get it if you need love 
 As much as a mustard seed is all you need 
 Small price to pay for the air that we breathe 
 And the baby is born, place to go when we leave 
 Food that we eat, weapon when we sleep 
 It's a miracle no believin' the Lord 
 (Krayzie Bone) 
 Hey! 
 What cha seein' on the news has already been written in the Bible 
 But ain't nobody takin' the time to realize that believin' and readin' 
 The scriptures could mean your survival and I don't wanna die no neva 
 I wanna live forever and I would a lot better 
 So when Armageddon really come true what chu gon' do? 
 (Krayzie) 
 Swing low (God loves me) 
 Swing low (Ask me how I know) 
 Swing low (God loves me, ask me how I know) 
 Swing low (God loves me, ask me how I know) 
 Swing low, swing low (I know 'cause the Bible tells me so) 
 (Layzie Bone) 
 You know God is good 
 You know God is great and everyday I wake 
 I gotta thank him for my life and even though its hard 
 I know I make mistakes I give it everything it takes just to make it right 
 This is Satan's land understand the plan y'all Jesus 
 Comin' back with a furious mind better praise everyday 
 Hurryin' doin' your job glory to the king that's my Heavenly Father

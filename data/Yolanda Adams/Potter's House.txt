In case you have fallen by the wayside of life 
 Dreams and visions shattered, 
 You are broken inside 
 You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in 
 The potter wants to put you back together again 
 In case your situation has turned upside down 
 And all that you've accomplished 
 Is now on the ground 
 You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in 
 The potter wants to put you back together again 
 Oh, the potter wants 
 To put you back together again 
 In case your situation has turned upside down 
 And all that you've accomplished 
 Is now on the ground 
 You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in 
 The potter wants to put you back together again 
 Oh, the potter wants 
 To put you back together again 
 You who are broken, stop by, the Potter's house 
 You who demanded, stop by, the Potter's house 
 Give him the fragments of your broken life (Oh-oh-oh) 
 You who are broken, stop by, the Potter's house 
 You who demanded, stop by, the Potter's house 
 Give him the fragments of your broken life 
 My friend, the potter wants 
 To put you back together again 
 Oh, the potter wants 
 To put you back together again 
 There's joy in the Potter's house 
 Joy in the Potter's house 
 Peace in the Potter's house 
 Peace in the Potter's house 
 Love in the Potter's house 
 Love in the Potter's house 
 Salvation in the Potter's house 
 Healing in the Potter's house 
 Deliverance in the Potter's house 
 Deliverance in the Potter's house 
 Everything you need in the Potter's house 
 Everything you need in the Potter's house 
 The potter wants to put you back together again 
 Oh, the potter wants 
 To put you back together again

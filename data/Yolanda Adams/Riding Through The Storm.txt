The storms of life will blow 
 They're sure to come and go 
 They meet us all at a time 
 When I'm calm and doing fine 
 But the Captain of my soul 
 He's always on board 
 He rocks me in His arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 While riding through the storm 
 Jesus holds me in His arms 
 I am not afraid 
 Of the stormy winds and the waves 
 Though the tides become high 
 He holds me while I ride 
 I find safety in the masters arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 I have no fear of the raging seas 
 Knowing Jesus will forever be right here with me 
 He can speak to the wind to my enemies and to the waves 
 And he make them all behave 
 All power's in the masters hand 
 When I'm on sea or dry land 
 I found safety in the Master's holding arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 (Oaah) While through the storm 
 Jezus holds me in his precious arms 
 Noohoho I'm not afraid of the stormy wind 
 No no

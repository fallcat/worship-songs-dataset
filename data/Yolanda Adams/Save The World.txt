Looking at the news today is a cold depressing thing we see our nation stained 
 And the whole worlds up in flames. People starving all over the land what a low 
 Down dirty shame and abroad we see the same we have our selves to blame. Well 
 It's been said that we should share what the master gives to us well the time 
 Has come to help someone less fortunate than us. 
 Save the world, feed the hungry people, clothe the little babies, lend a 
 Helping hand. 
 Save the world, feed the hungry people, show them we love and care. 
 I took a walk into town this morning a beggar followed me he said he needed 
 Food to eat and spare some change please. I took him into the closest grill and 
 Paid for all he could eat it warmed my heart as he said thank you ma'am to me. 
 Well it saddened me as walked a little further just to see that there is more 
 Than one on every corner without a place to sleep. 
 We've got to feed the hungry mind soul and body shelter feed and cloth everybody 
 With much as we can please stretch out your hand.

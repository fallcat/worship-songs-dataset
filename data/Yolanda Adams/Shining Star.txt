When you wish upon a star 
 Your dreams will take you very far 
 But, when you wish upon a dream 
 Life ain't always what it seems 
 What'd you see on night so clear 
 In the sky so very dear 
 You're a shining star 
 No matter who you are 
 Shining bright to see 
 What you could truly be 
 You can be what you wanna be 
 Do what you wanna do 
 As long as you know there's a star in you 
 Believe in yourself 
 Shining star come in to view 
 Shine its watchful light on you 
 Gives you strength to carry on 
 Makes your body big and strong 
 On an adventure of the Son (that's S-o-n) 
 Thought my work had just begun 
 Found out, found out 
 Thought I had to stir the mood 
 I can do all things through You 
 So, if you find yourself in need 
 Why don't you listen to these words of heed 
 Be a child that's free of sin 
 These are words of wisdom 
 "Yes I can, yes I can," because

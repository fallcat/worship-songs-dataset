There is a place in me 
 That no one but You can see 
 And in that place I'm really insecure 
 I've been hurt before by that 
 But I'm really sure You understand 
 Every tear I've cried 
 I bet You've cried a million more 
 How can I get back to where my smile I had was real 
 I'm desperate for Your touch 
 And I miss Your voice so much 
 Lord show me Your face 
 I'm longing for Your presence in this place 
 I give You all the pieces 
 'Cause you made a promise 
 You put me back together 
 Better than I was before 
 In the coldness of the night 
 I'm surrounded by Your light 
 Even in the darkness, 
 You tell me don't be afraid 
 I am not afraid 
 After all that I've been through 
 I'm still valuable to you 
 So I run to Your arms 
 Where I'm safe within Your praise 
 And just in case I forgot to tell You 
 Don't ever let me go 
 I'm desperate for Your touch 
 And I miss Your voice so much 
 Lord show me Your face 
 I'm longing for Your presence in this place 
 I give You all the pieces 
 'Cause you made a promise 
 You put me back together 
 Better than I was before 
 Lord, show me your will 
 Until you do I promise that I'll be still 
 So, come and take these pieces and 
 You made me a promise 
 You put me back together 
 Better than I was before 
 Before I met You 
 Before I knew You 
 My heart ached for something that I could not explain 
 And then, when I saw You, 
 I finally knew what I thought love was before had changed 
 Lord show me Your face 
 I'm longing for Your presence in this place 
 I give You all the pieces 
 'Cause you made a promise 
 You put me back together 
 Better than I was before

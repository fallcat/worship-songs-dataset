Silent night, holy night, 
 All is calm, all is bright 
 Round yon virgin mother and child, 
 Holy infant so tender and mild, 
 Sleep in heavenly peace, 
 Sleep in heavenly peace. 
 Silent night, holy night, 
 Darkness flies, all is light; 
 Shepherds hear the angels sing, 
 "Alleluia! hail the King! 
 Christ the Saviour is born, 
 Christ the Saviour is born." 
 Silent night, holy night, 
 Shepherds quake at the sight, 
 Glories stream from heaven afar, 
 Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia; 
 Christ the Savior is born! 
 Christ the Savior is born! 
 Silent night, holy night, 
 Son of God, love's pure light 
 Radiant beams from thy holy face 
 With the dawn of redeeming grace, 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth, 
 Jesus, Lord, at thy birth. 
 Silent night, holy night, 
 Wondrous star, led thy light; 
 With the angels let us sing, 
 Alleluia to our King; 
 Christ the Savior is born, 
 Christ the Savior is born.

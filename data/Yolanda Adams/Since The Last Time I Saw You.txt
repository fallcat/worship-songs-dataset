Oh, ooh 
 Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea 
 Since the last time I saw you 
 God has moved another mountain out of my way 
 Led me to green pastures 
 Turned my midnight into day 
 Placed my feet upon rock to stand 
 Oh yes 
 Since the last time I saw you 
 God has calmed another raging storm in my life 
 Led me into safety 
 Turned my darkness into light 
 And now I stand in the power of his might 
 You would have thought that God has already done enough for me 
 When he took my place at Calvary 
 But he does so much more and more right before me eyes 
 And I have no other choice but to stand and testify 
 Stand and testify 
 Since the last time I saw you 
 God has worked another wondrous miracle for me 
 Led me into triumph now my blinded eyes can see 
 That Christ the Lord performs victoriously, oh 
 You would have thought that he'd done enough for me 
 When he took my place at Calvary 
 But he does more, and more, and more, and more every day 
 He makes a way and he's made a way 
 Since the last time I saw you 
 Things have changed 
 I'm not the same 
 Since the last time

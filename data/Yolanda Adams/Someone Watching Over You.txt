Say that your not afraid 
 Your just fine 
 Got it all figured out this time 
 All of the plans you made 
 Will work out 
 Deep inside you have your doubts 
 But your clinging to your pride 
 And you trust 
 You'll know 
 Your free to let it go 
 Cause even when it rains outside 
 There is light 
 Even when you cry all night 
 You're all right 
 Even when you loose your way 
 You'll get through 
 Cause there is someone watching over you 
 Say you've been hurt before your afraid 
 That you'll never love again 
 And why should you take a chance just to fall 
 But you'd rather build a wall 
 Than believe that you are loved 
 Open up your heart 
 Someone needs you as you are 
 I've been there 
 At times I get scared 
 It's true 
 But I hold on to that 
 I can't see 
 Something inside of me 
 And that's what give me strength to believe

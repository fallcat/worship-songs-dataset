Hold on and don't give up 
 Don't you worry 
 You don't have to cry 
 'Cause he, he see's what you're going through 
 Yes he does 
 God is willing, and he is able 
 This did not catch him by surprise 
 So just trust him 
 And just oh step aside 
 Be still and don't question it 
 These obstacles, they were allowed 
 He wants to take you higher and higher 
 If you will hold on 
 God is willing and more than able 
 This did not catch him by surprise 
 So just trust him 
 And just step aside 
 Oh I know he's faithful 
 My God is faithful 
 To do what he said he'll do 
 Now if he said, just believe it 
 There's nothing he can't do 
 You must stand on his word (stand on his word) 
 Cast all your cares on him (give them to him) 
 'Cause he knows and he loves you 
 He did it for me, that's why I can say 
 Step, just step aside 
 God can work a miracle for you 
 Step aside 
 You got to let go 
 And let God 
 Let go and let God be God 
 Move yourself out of the way 
 Move your pride out of the way 
 He'll never leave you 
 Nor forsake you 
 This what I know, it ain't just what I heard 
 So I thank you, Lord, for being awesome to me 
 You're marvelous 
 Praise him, praise Him 
 Oh step aside 
 Let go, let go, let go 
 He knows what you go through 
 He knows what you can bear 
 He can do what you can't do 
 So step, so step, so step aside 
 Thank you, Lord 
 And you're in control 
 So I step aside

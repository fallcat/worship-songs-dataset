Shattered but I'm not broken 
 Woudned the time will heal 
 Heavy the load the cross I bear 
 Lonley the road I trod I dare 
 Shaken but here I stand 
 Weary still I press on 
 Long are the nights the tears I cry 
 Dark are the days no sun in the skys 
 Yet still I rise 
 Never to give up 
 Never to give in 
 Against all odds 
 Yet still I rise 
 High above the clouds 
 Yet times I feel low 
 Yet still I rise 
 Sometimes I'm troubled 
 But not is despair 
 Struggling I make my way through 
 Trials they come to make me strong 
 I must endure I must hold on 
 Yet still I rise 
 Never to give up 
 Never to give in 
 Agasint all odds 
 Yet still I rise 
 High above the clouds 
 At times I feel Low 
 Yet still I rise 
 Above all my problems 
 Above all my eyes can see 
 Knowing God is able 
 To strengthen me 
 To strengthen me 
 Yet still I rise 
 Never to give up 
 Never to give in 
 Against all odds 
 Yet still I rise 
 High above the clouds 
 At times I feel Low 
 Yet still I 
 I need to know which way to go 
 Yet still I 
 At times I feel Low 
 Yet still I 
 I rise 
 Yet still I rise 
 Oh yes I do

When I think about how you saved my soul 
 I'm compelled to praise you 
 Like a woman out of control 
 So I lift up holy hands 
 I take advantage of this chance to say thank you 
 When I think about what you brought me through 
 I'm reminded to praise you for all that you had to do 
 So I lift up holy hands 
 I take advantage of this chance to say thank you 
 So from the bottom of my heart I say 
 Thank you, Thank you, Thank you 
 When I think about were you brought me from 
 I gotta praise you like the victories already won 
 And I lift my hands 
 I take advantage of this chance to say thank you 
 When I think about oh Lord yes 
 Why you love me so 
 I'm compelled to praise you because 
 I really don't care whose looking and who knows that I love you 
 And I lift up my holy hands 
 I take advantage of this chance to say thank you 
 Oh, everyday of my life I just wanna say 
 Thank you, (Thank you Lord) 
 Thank you, (I gotta thank you) 
 Thank you, (Because of who you been to me) 
 Thank you, (You been a shealter in the storm) 
 Oh and I Thank you 
 You been a rock that I can stand on Thank you Lord 
 And I say Thank you 
 You been a bridge over any kind of water 
 I gotta say Lord I thank you 
 With all my heart with all my soul 
 Everything within me says thank you Lord 
 Thank you Lord 
 Lord I thank you, Lord I thank you, Lord I thank you 
 For all you done to me 
 Thank you Lord 
 There's no words that I can say but you been good 
 I can't thank you enough no no no no no 
 Thank you Lord (I just wanna thank you) 
 I wanna thank, I wanna thank you 
 I gotta thank you, just wanna thank you 
 I thank you yes, I thank you yes, I thank you yes, I thank you yes 
 And I say... I wanna thank you 
 Said Lord I thank you yes 
 Thank you

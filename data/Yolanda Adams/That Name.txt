There is a name that is so precious 
 A name that's wonderful to me 
 A name that's worthy of all praises 
 Because of him I am made free. 
 That name is Jesus 
 Oh how I love him 
 The one who gave his life for me 
 Because of love that is so precious 
 I will have life eternally 
 This name speaKs peace unto my storm clouds 
 This name speaKs calm unto my fears 
 And when I feel that no one loves me 
 His loving presence is so near 
 That name is Jesus 
 Oh how I love him 
 The one who gave his life for me 
 Because of love that is so precious 
 I will have life eternally 
 Praise that name 
 Praise that name 
 Praise that name 
 Praise that name 
 Some day I'll leave this earthly dwelling 
 Through time and space my soul will soar 
 And finally see tha face of Jesus 
 And praise the name forever more 
 That name is Jesus (Jesus) 
 Oh how I love him (I love him) 
 The one who gave (Jesus) his life for me 
 Because of love that is so precious 
 I will have life eternally---oh 
 (Jesus) precious is that name 
 (I love him) oh glorious 
 (Jesus) is that name 
 (I love him) oh wonderful 
 (Jesus) is that name 
 (I love him) 
 Just praise ... 
 That name...

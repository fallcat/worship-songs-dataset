(Talking) 
 There is no pain. Jesus can't feel. 
 No hurt he can not heal. 
 All things work 
 According to his perfect will 
 No matter what, 
 You're going through. 
 Remember God is using you 
 For the battle is not yours. 
 It's the Lords. 
 There is no sadness 
 Jesus can feel 
 And there is no sorrow 
 That he can not heal 
 For All things work according to the masters Holy Will. No matter what, you're going through remember God is only using you 
 For this battle is not yours. 
 It's, the Lords 
 (It's the Lords) 
 (Till fade) 
 No, it's not yours, it's the Lords

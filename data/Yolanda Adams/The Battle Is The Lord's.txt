Speaking: What are you trying to say Yolanda? 
 Look forget about all that other junk 
 This battle ain't yours, it's the lord's 
 Think about it, and then start shouting help me sing 
 v1 
 There is no pain, Jesus can't feel 
 There is no hurt, that He can't heal 
 For all things work [yes they do] 
 According to the masters purpose 
 And his holy will 
 No matter what [you in the balcony] 
 Are going through, remember that God only wants a chance to use you 
 For the battle is not yours it's the Lord's 
 (We gonna tell the devil that all right?) 
 There's no sadness, Jesus can't feel 
 And there is no sorrow, 
 That the master is not able and willing to heal 
 Remember that all things work 
 They're not gonna be all good 
 But they're gonna work according to God's purpose and his holy will 
 No matter what, no matter what you're going through 
 Remember God sees all and he knows all 
 And all he wants to do is use you

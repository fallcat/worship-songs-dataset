The first Noel, the angel did say, 
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay; 
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep, 
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel. 
 They looked up and say a star 
 Shining in the east, beyond them far; 
 And to the earth it gave great light, 
 And so it continued both day and night. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel. 
 And by the light of that same star 
 Three wise men came from country far; 
 To seek for a king was their intent, 
 And to follow the star wherever it went. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel. 
 This star drew nigh to the northwest, 
 O'er Bethlehem it took its rest, 
 And there it did both stop and stay, 
 Right over the place where Jesus lay. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel. 
 Then entered in those wise men three, 
 Full reverently up on the knee, 
 And offered there, in His presence, 
 Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, 
 Born is the King of Israel.

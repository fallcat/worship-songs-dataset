Quietly He speaks to me. 
 Gently He leads me. 
 Lovingly the Shepherd carries me. 
 He carries me hidden safely in His bosom 
 I feel His love inside when other times, my friend, I couldn't. 
 He knows just what's best for me; 
 The Good Shepherd knows, He knows 
 Just what I need. 
 Quietly He speaks. 
 Gently the Master leads. 
 So lovingly He carries me to 
 A safe place of rest. 
 And I feel the Master's unconditional love, 
 Everlasting love, 
 Ever so deeply inside of me. 
 I'm so glad Jesus knows 
 Just what's best for me. 
 The Good Shepherd knows -- 
 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
 I will fear no evil, for Jesus is with me. 
 He leads me, He guides me, He hides me 
 In the shelter of His arms; 
 He holds me there. 
 The Good Shepherd knows 
 Just what I need.

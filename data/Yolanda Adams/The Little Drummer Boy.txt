Come they told me, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 A new born king to see, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum. 
 Our finest gifts we bring, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 To lay before the king, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 Pum pum, pum, pum, 
 Rum pum, pum, pum. 
 So, to honor him, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 When we come, we come. 
 Baby Jesus, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 I am a poor boy too, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum. 
 I have no gift to bring, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 That's fit to give our king, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 Rum pum, pum, pum, 
 Rum pum, pum, pum. 
 Shall I play for you, 
 Pa rum pum, pum, pum, 
 On my drum, my drum. 
 Can I play for you on my drum? 
 I have no gift to bring, 
 Except my drum. 
 I'll play my best for you, 
 I'll best my best for you on my drum.

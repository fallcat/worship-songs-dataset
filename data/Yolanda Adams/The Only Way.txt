Written by Mervyn Warren / Fred Vaughn 
 Everywhere that I go 
 I must tell everyone of the Savior I know 
 And the things He has done 
 He's the Truth and the Life 
 And there's no other way to the Father 
 But by him 
 Long ago when He knew you'd be out on a limb 
 He gave His life for you 
 Can't you live yours for him 
 He's the Almighty Rock 
 And you won't have a firm foundation 
 Unless you're build on Him 
 You can't live without Him 
 You can't move without Him 
 You can't breathe without Him 
 You can't think about doing one thing without Him 
 You can't do without Him 
 'Cause there's no you without Him 
 Because He's the only way 
 The only way 
 There's no other name 
 Than the name of Jesus 
 There's no one 
 Than the one who frees us 
 There's no other way 
 No other way 
 What more can I say? 
 He's the only only way 
 The only way

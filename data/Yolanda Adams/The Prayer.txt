Y: I pray you'll be our eyes 
 And watch us where we go 
 And help us to be wise 
 In times when we don't know 
 Let this be our prayer 
 When we lose our way 
 Lead us to a place 
 Guide us with your grace 
 To a place where we'll be safe. 
 I pray we'll find your light 
 Y: I pray we'll find your light 
 And hold it in our hearts 
 Y: And hold it in our hearts 
 And stars go out each night 
 Y: Stars go out each night 
 Remind us where you are. 
 Y: Remind us where you are. 
 Let this be our prayer 
 Y: Let this be our prayer 
 When shadows fill our day 
 Y: When shadows fill our day 
 Lead us to a place 
 Y: Guide us with your grace 
 D: Guide us with your grace 
 Together: Give us faith so we'll be safe. 
 Together: 
 A world where pain and sorrow will be ended 
 And every heart that's broken will be mended 
 And we'll remember we are all God's children 
 Reaching out to touch you 
 Reaching to the sky. 
 D: We ask that life be kind 
 Y: We ask that life be kind 
 D: And watch us from above 
 Y: And watch us from above 
 D: We hope each soul will find 
 Y: We hope each soul will find 
 D: Another soul to love 
 Y: Another soul to love. 
 Together: Let this be our prayer 
 Y: Let this be our prayer 
 D: Just like every child. 
 Y: Just like every child. 
 Together: 
 Needs to find a place 
 Guide us with your grace. Repeat 
 Give us faith so we'll be safe.

Every day that goes by 
 Every moment you'll find 
 There's a broken heart 
 A tear is cried 
 A wish is made 
 That never comes true 
 And somewhere someone needs to be found 
 The things we do, the things we say 
 Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all each day 
 The things we do, the things we say 
 These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away 
 The things we do 
 Every day in this life 
 Every moment you'll find 
 A heart is healed 
 A dream is found 
 A tear is dried 
 And laughter is heard 
 And somehow someone's life will be changed by 
 The things we do, the things we say 
 Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all each day 
 The things we do, the things we say 
 These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away 
 The things we do 
 Oh every hand that has been held 
 Has reached out for somebody else 
 In every move we make 
 Every day 
 We pass love on this way

The storms of life will blow 
 They're sure to come and go 
 They meet me at a time when I'm calm and doing fine 
 But the captain of my soul, he's always on board 
 He rocks me in his arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 While riding through the storm 
 Jesus holds me in his arms 
 I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains 
 Though clouds become high 
 He holds me while I ride 
 I found safety in his arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 I have no fear of the raging sea 
 Knowing Jesus is there with me 
 He can speak to the winds and the waves 
 And make them behave 
 All power's in his hand 
 On sea or dry land 
 I found safety in the master's arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 While I'm riding through the storm 
 Jesus holds me in his arms 
 No, I'm not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains 
 Though the tide becomes high 
 He holds me while I ride 
 I found safety in the master's arms 
 While riding through the storm. 
 While riding through the storm?. 
 While riding through the storm?. 
 Yeah, while I'm riding through the storm 
 Jesus holds me in arms while I'm riding through the storm 
 Let the winds blow, I don't care, I'm riding through the storm 
 Let the rains fall down, I'm riding through the storm with Jesus 
 Jesus is the captain of my soul, yes, yeyeyes 
 He is the captain of my soul?

In the middle of the turbulence surrounding you 
 These trying times that are so hard to endure 
 In the middle of what seems to be your darkest hour 
 Hold fast your heart and be assured 
 This too shall pass 
 Like every night that's come before it 
 He'll never give you more than you can bear 
 This too shall pass 
 So in this thought be comforted 
 It's in His Hands 
 This too shall pass 
 The Father knows the tears you cry before they fall 
 He feels your pain, His heart and yours are one 
 The Father knows that sorrow's heavy chains are strong 
 But with His strength, you'll overcome 
 This too shall pass 
 Like every night that's come before it 
 He'll never give you more than you can bear 
 This too shall pass 
 So in this thought be comforted 
 It's in His Hands 
 This too shall pass 
 So set your eyes upon the mountain 
 And lift your hands up to the sky 
 And let His arms of love surround you 
 And take you to the other side 
 This too shall pass 
 Like every night that's come before it 
 He'll never give you more than you can bear 
 This too shall pass 
 So in this thought be comforted 
 It's in His Hands 
 This too shall pass

The storms of life will blow 
 They're sure to come and go 
 They meet me at a time 
 When I'm calm and doing fine 
 But the Captain of my soul 
 He's always on board 
 He rocks me in His arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 While riding through the storm 
 Jesus holds me in His arms 
 I am not afraid 
 Of the stormy winds and the waves 
 Though the tides become high 
 He holds me while I ride 
 I find safety in His arms 
 While riding through the storm 
 I have no fear of the raging seas 
 Knowing Jesus is there for me 
 He can speak to the wind and the waves 
 And make them behave 
 All power's in His hand 
 On sea or dry land 
 I found safety in the Master's arms 
 While riding through the storm

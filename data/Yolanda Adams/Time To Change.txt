It's been to long its time to change 
 Can't get away with everything 
 Please tell me why you wait 
 Gotta answer for yourself someday 
 A man that I know from the neighborhood 
 Whenever I see him hes up to no good 
 Taking from others to get what he wants 
 And he think's that there's no way he'll ever get caught 
 This girl that I knew from the neighborhood 
 Whenever I saw her she was up to no good 
 Writing letters and sending pictures and doin' all she can 
 Tryin' hard to gain 
 The attention of 
 A married man (girl ya wrong now)

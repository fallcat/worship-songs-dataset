I know it's been a while now, 
 Since you last heard from me, 
 Or talked to me 
 It's been kind of hard lately 
 I've had a lot on my mind 
 It's been so long that, 
 I'm afraid that the words may not come out right 
 But, tonight I'll try 
 Tonight 
 Tonight I'll try 
 Tonight 
 I know that prayin' ain't always easy 
 It's hard sometimes to express what you feel inside 
 Especially when you don't think God is listening 
 It's been raining now for sometime 
 But instead of what I see 
 You want me to trust You, working it out for me 
 So, tonight I will try 
 Tonight 
 Oh oh oh 
 Tonight I'll try 
 Tonight 
 Who ever told you that living in this world would be easy? 
 Baby, they lied 
 And, whoever said that lovin' folk that don't love you back ain't really hard 
 Even though you really tryin' 
 Telling you what I'm going through 
 Sometimes it's harder than I realize 
 But tonight I'll try 
 Tonight 
 Tonight I'll try 
 Tonight 
 So, tonight when you get home 
 You oughta unplug the phone 
 And get alone 
 Tell your Father how you truly feel 
 Even if your words don't come out right 
 For no matter how far you've gone 
 God's love can find you, and bring you back home 
 So, tonight you oughta try, 
 Tonight 
 So, tonight you oughta try, 
 Tonight 
 Who ever told you that living in this world would be easy? 
 Baby, they lied 
 And, whoever said that lovin' folk who don't love you back ain't really hard 
 Even though you really tryin' 
 Telling you what I'm going through 
 Sometimes it's harder than I realize 
 But tonight I'll try 
 Tonight 
 Tonight I'll try 
 Tonight 
 Tonight 
 Take away my pain (Tonight) 
 Take away my strains (Tonight) 
 And let me live (Tonight) 
 All over again (Tonight) 
 Tonight I'm gonna throw my hands up (Tonight) 
 Tonight I'm gonna give it all up (Tonight) 
 Tonight I wanna turn it all around (Tonight) 
 Put my feet on solid ground (Tonight) 
 Won't you take me where you need to take me (Tonight) 
 Won't you do with me what you wanna do with me (Tonight) 
 Tonight 
 Tonight 
 This night 
 Tonight 
 I'm yours 
 I'm yours (x3)

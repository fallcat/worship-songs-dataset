Unconditional, unconditional 
 Unconditional, unconditional 
 Who else would let someone nail them to a cross 
 For the sake of others so they would not be lost 
 No one, No one, will go that far for us 
 Who else would let someone get away with so much wrong 
 But still extend them gret (**grace**) 
 No one, No one, have so much love for us 
 The kind of love he shows is unconditional 
 His love don't come and go it's unconditional 
 Who else but him 
 He's a constant friend 
 Even when others turn them backs against 
 No one, No one is always there for us 
 So what kind of love 
 So even when your closest friends and family give up on you 
 There's not a day when you can't depend on him

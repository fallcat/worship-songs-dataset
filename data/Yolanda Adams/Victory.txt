I got, got the victory 
 I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus yes I do He is a mighty conqueror 
 In him I will trust all my battle's He'll fight 
 I got, got the victory I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus 
 For me He died but He rose on the third day that's why I have true victory everyday 
 Truly I been through the storm and rain 
 I know everything about heartache and pain 
 But God carried me through it all 
 Without His protection I'd surely fall

 I'm not worried 'bout material things I don't have 
 I just rest 'cause I'm sure in my savior's care 
 'Cause I know that my blessing is on the way 
 I can't see it right now but I stand by faith 
 I fought many, many battle's in His name 
 I held up the bloodstained banner and proclaim 
 That Jesus is the Truth and the Light 
 Believe it when I say He will make it all right 
 Yeah I got the victory, yeah I got the victory yeah, yeah, yeah

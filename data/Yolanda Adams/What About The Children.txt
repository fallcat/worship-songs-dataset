Tears streaming down, her heart is broken 
 Because her life is hurting, so am I 
 He wears a frown, his dreams are choking 
 And because he stands alone, his dreams will die 
 So, humbly I come to you and say 
 As I sound aloud the warfare of today 
 Hear me, I pray 
 What about the children 
 To ignore is so easy 
 So many innocent children will choose the wrong way 
 So what about the children 
 Remember when we were children 
 And if not for those who loved us and who cared enough to show us 
 Where would we be today 
 Sir, where is your son 
 Where lies his refuge 
 And if he can't come to you, then where can he run 
 Such a foolish girl, yet still, she's your daughter 
 And if you will just reminisce your days of young 
 You see, it's not where you've been, nor what you've done 
 Because I know a friend who specializes in great outcomes 
 See His love overcomes 
 What about the children 
 Don't just turn and walk away 
 What about the children 
 Hey need our love and our help today 
 Yes, what about the children 
 Remember when we were children 
 And if not for those who loved us and who cared enough to show us 
 Where would we be today 
 Where would we be today 
 Where would we be today 
 Where would we be today 
 What about the the children

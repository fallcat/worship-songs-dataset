Wherever you are, I wanna be 
 It's never to far, it don't matter 
 Just take me there 
 Music 
 There's never a place to far 
 Too far for me to go 
 'Cause I always feel at home with you 
 I'll cover the universe and land on every star 
 If I can find out where you are - it's true 
 Chorus: Mountain high - Valley low, Desert heat, 
 Arctic cold - Wherever you are, that's where I want to be 
 Mountain high - Valley low, Desert heat, Arctic cold. 
 Wherever you are, that's where I want to be 
 Take me on a vision quest - And focus in on me 
 So you can tell me what you see in me 
 Please don't let me live a lie 
 Let me live in honesty 
 'Cause you're the only truth that can set me free 
 That's why I want to go 
 Without you I feel like I could lose my mind 
 That's why I can't let go 
 I'll just keep on trying 
 Seeking you to the end of all time 
 Following you any place, anywhere 
 Cause wherever you are, I want to be there

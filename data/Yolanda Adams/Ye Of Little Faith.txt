Oh, I see those hidden tears 
 And I know each time your heart bleeds 
 Your desires have not been ignored 
 Ye of little faith you must believe 
 That I came to give you life 
 And a life more abundantly 
 Seek ye first the things which are of God 
 Ye of little faith you must believe 
 You must know I love you so 
 So much more than you will ever, ever know 
 For my promises, my promises, promises are true 
 And everything I say, I can do 
 I will do I will do I will do 
 I can do I can do I can do 
 Yeah 
 Oh I see those hidden tears 
 Y se cada vez que sangra su corazón 
 Your desires have not been ignored 
 Ustedes los de poca fe beben creer 
 That I came to give you life 
 Y viven más abundante 
 Seek ye first the things which are of God 
 Ustedes los de poca fe beben creer 
 Ye of little faith you must believe 
 Ustedes los de poca fe beben creer 
 Ye of little faith you must believe

 You must believe that I can do all things 
 I can do all things because

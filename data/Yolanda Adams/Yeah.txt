 Yeah 
 Can I be committed is the question in my head 
 All the issues in my life keep holding me back 
 Can I live up to the standard 
 Seems so hard to do 
 Then you tell me take your hand 
 You'll help me make it through ooh 
 You ask me child do you love me 
 And Ii say yeah (yeah) yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah) 
 But will you just give up everything 
 And follow me yeah (yeah) yeah yeah 
 We talk periodically which should be everyday 
 Can imagine how it could be if I let you lead the way 
 No broken hearts less scars less road 
 That never have an end 
 So I throw away my pride let down my guard lord here I am yeah 
 Will I just stop and think of all that you've done 
 How can I say anything but 
 Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah yeah

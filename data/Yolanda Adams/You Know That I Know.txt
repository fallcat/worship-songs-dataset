Lord, You've been in my shoes before 
 You already know what's up 
 You've been rejected by those closest to You 
 You've even drank from life's bitter cup 
 You know what it's like to be denied 
 And to have tears swimming in Your eyes 
 Sometimes, I want to hold up my hands 
 But I know You have a plan for me 
 (Because I told you) 
 I will be your everything 
 To me all your troubles bring 
 For me I want you to sing 
 You know that I know 
 I assure you I'll be there 
 All your burden I will bear 
 I'll let you know that I care 
 You know that I know 
 Lord, You felt what I feel 
 You know that the pain is real 
 Those who were there that said they loved You 
 Turned their backs when You needed them 
 But I must say 
 You have never let me down, nor forsaken me 
 You would always pick me up 
 When the world would fall on me 
 I can trust in Your every word 
 Your voice, I hear You 
 I know I heard You tell me, say 
 (Because I told you) 
 I will be your everything 
 To me all your troubles bring 
 For me I want you to sing 
 You know that I know 
 I assure you I'll be there 
 All your burden I will bear 
 I'll let you know that I care 
 You know that I know 
 I take a stand and hold my ground 
 For in me true love is found 
 I will always be around 
 You know that I know 
 Even when you heart is breaking 
 When it seems to much to take 
 And even when your soul is aching 
 You know that I know 
 Even when the world is cold 
 I'll be there your hand to hold 
 Trust me, love me and be bold 
 You know that I know 
 No-one else can give you more 
 Blessings for you are in store 
 I will never ignore you 
 You know that I know 
 I will be your everything 
 To me all your troubles bring 
 Girl, I want you to sing for me 
 You know that I know
